1]\nI dance around this empty house\nTear us down, throw you out\nScreaming down the halls\nSpinnin' all around and now we fall\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nPictures framing up the past\nYour taunting smirk behind the glass\nThis museum full of ash\nOnce a tickle, now a rash\n[Chorus]\nThis used to be our funhouse\nBut now it's full of evil clowns\nIt's time to start the countdown\nI'm gonna burn it down, down, down\nI'm gonna burn it down\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nNine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, fun!\n\n[Verse 2]\nEchoes knockin' on locked doors\nAll the laughter from before\nI'd rather live out on the street\nThan in this haunted memory\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nI've called the movers, called the maids\nWe'll try to exorcise this place\nDrag my mattress to the yard\nCrumble, tumble, house of cards\n\n[Chorus]\nThis used to be our funhouse\nBut now it's full of evil clowns\nIt's time to start the countdown\nI'm gonna burn it down, down, down\nThis used to be our funhouse\nBut now

shorts, mini skirt\nWalkin' on the beach, so pretty\nYou wasn't lookin' for a man\nWhen you saw me in the sand\nBut you fell for the boy from the city\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI was like\n\"Hey, girl, can I get your number?\"\nI remember what you told me too\n\"Don't call after 10:00\", but you know that I did\n'Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'bout you\n\n[Chorus]\nI think about you in the summertime\nAnd all the good times we had, baby\nBeen a few years and I can't deny\nThe thought of you still makes me crazy\nI think about you in the summertime\nI'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind\nMy summertime\n\n[Verse 2]\nDo you remember? I'll never forget\nTouchin' your body all soakin' wet\nThe water was cool, the feelin' was hot\nKissin' on you while the ocean rocked\nIn your strapless sundress\nKickin' back, no stress\nAs long as we was together\n'Cause we were feelin' young love\nAnd we couldn't get enough\nBaby, I could reminisce forever\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]\nAnd now I'm like\nHey, girl, don't you know I miss

Lyrics[Intro: 50 Cent]\n50 Cent\nCiara\nI'm focused, man (DarkChild)\nYou should know this, man\n\n[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nJust one dose of me will have you addicted\nTo know me is to love me; I handle my business\nAny city any town - touch down; I do my thing\nI'm a hustler, baby, I provide by any means\nI'm a great conversationist, you should know what I'm about\nWhen you look at me baby you should see a way out\nOut the hood, out the drama, out the Bentley that's on\nOut the headache an stress you done been through before\n[Verse 2: Ciara]\nIt's only been three months and I already got it bad\nSo hood that I keep on coming back\nMy girlfriend's telling me I don't know how to act\nBut I'm telling them, \"Baby, bye, fall back\"\nHe's so good and he knows how to love me\nBut so hood and he's so heavy in the streets\nHe's my dude and you better get used to things\nAnd I don't care what you say about me\nThey say\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Ciara]\nThat he does it with the best, runs it in the west\nTatted on his chest (Uh-huh)\nI like it (So what?), I like it\nAnd they say (That he's gonna hurt me)\nJust wait and see (But they don't know me)\n'Cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it\n\n[Chorus: Ciara]\nI can't leave 'em alone\nI tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on\nIt's just that he know what I want\nSo bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone\nI can't leave 'em alone\nI tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on\nIt's just that he know what I want\nSo bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Ciara]\nSo when I had a good guy, he didn't do that much for me\nTried to be hard, but that he could never be\nAlways tell me that no one could compare to me\nBut couldn't handle it when other guy was staring at me\nNow the top lays back so everyone could look at me\nFrom the A to hills up in Beverly\nHe's so fly that he knows how to carry me\nFirst class when they talk, we don't hear what they say\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Ciara]\nThat he does it with the best, runs it in the west\nTatted on his chest (Uh-huh)\nI like it (So what?), I like it\nAnd they say (That he's gonna hurt me)\nJust wait and see (But they don't know me)\n'Cause I am what he wants his girl and I love it\n\n[Chorus: Ciara]\nI can't leave 'em alone\nI tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on\nIt's just that he know what I want\nSo bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone\nI can't leave 'em alone\nI tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on\nIt's just that he know what I want\nSo bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone\n[Verse 4: 50 Cent & Ciara]\nThe more I get, the more my ambition; tell me there's more\nI'll move an eighth for that girl; I'll move a half for that boy\nThen I flip that (Double up) kick back (Cuddle up)\nYour friends try to confuse but you know what\nMy intentions are good, I can't help it I'm hood\nI wouldn't change if I could, you shouldn't tell me I should\nBaby, you should take me as I am\nAnd be happy you're my girl 'cause I'm happy I'm your man (I can't)\n\n[Bridge: Ciara]\nIf he gets caught, it just takes one call, I'll come running\nBoy, I promise I will be there for you\nAll my heart, it belongs to you\nI can't lose you, boy, I just can't leave you alone\n\n[Chorus: Ciara]\nI can't leave 'em alone (I can't leave 'em alone)\nI tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on (Ah)\nIt's just that he know what I want\nSo bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone (So bad, I can't)\nI can't leave 'em alone (I can't keep)\nI tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on (Baby, did you)\nIt's just that he know what I want (Oh, oh)\nSo bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone (So bad)\nI can't leave 'em alone (Smile for me, yeah)\nI tried that good boy game, but the dope boy's turning me on (Let me see his thrill)\nIt's just that he know what I want (I know what I want)\nSo bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone (Turning me on)\nI can't leave 'em alone (Ah)\nI tried that game, but the dope boy's turning me on (No)\nIt's just that he know what I want (So bad)\nSo bad, I love that, I can't leave 'em alone (Ah)\n\n[Outro: Ciara & Rodney Jerkins]\nIt's another Darkchild classic, man\nLeave you all alone\nLeave you all alone\nNo, no, no\nYour boy so crazy\nOh, oh, oh9Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

system bump\n[Chamillionaire]\nSay Jibbs I'm about to head out to that Lou\nAnd holla at you about some fetti, hit my celly soon as you ready\nLet's get this cheese like a deli\nThey thought I was a lunatic when I pulled up to the telly\nI had that candy coated chevy showing it's grills like it's Nelly\nAnd the ladies love me, why is that?\nThey love the way I be getting my lean on\nYellow diamond, and bring in my multi-colored diamond bling on\nThat king kong yea I bet cha this gon' be the theme song\nCause that king kong will have your ears ringing like a ring tone\n[Hook]\nYou might

and the races\nThe people and the places\nThere is always somewhere else I had to be\nTime gets slim, my old friend\n[Interlude]\nDo not know why, do not know why\nDo not know why, do not know

Snoop Dogg trial was done\nDre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me\nI watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine\nWorkin' with Dr. Dre was a (\"Dream\")\nI had visions of makin' a classic, then my world turned black\nLike I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses\nIt's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West\nComing back from his fatal accident to beatmakin' and rappin'\nBut, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that\nIt's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back\n\n[Chorus: The Game & (Sample)]\nBlushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen

Vivica\nHurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze\nThen joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze\nUsed to dream of being Unsigned Hype\n'Til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page\nDaydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage\nI thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay\nSo I walked over, heard Jam Master say\n\"It's a hard knock life, then

right\n\n[Chorus]\nBut, too much of a good thing\nIs a good thing\nFeelings like this can't be wrong\nAnd, too much of a good thing\nIs a good thing\nAnd we've got a good thing going on\n[Verse 2]\nYou look in my eyes\nAnd see my thinking\nI know when you're happy, when you're sad\nSomeone said\nIt's too perfect\nBut, I don't think what we have is so bad\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Outro]\nAnd we've got

subtle signs\nWhen I cuddle mine, she ain't even tryin'\nTo look sexy, but even if she was, so what?\nMotherfucker grow up, don't mean to be so abrupt\nBut that let's me know that she's a human being\nAnd being human's hard\u2014on the boulevard\nGirl, you got it bad, glad I'm not one\nBut yet you got it good, you are the hot one\nBut I'm Andr\u00e9, Benjamin Andr\u00e9 to be exact\nYou'd hope to meet a gentleman one day, well this is that\nIn fact, Dookie introduced us at a show\nAbout a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me\nI'm in the Southern states, you know, where all the pimps be\nDressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups\nAnd yes, you're getting booed if your shit do not get down\nAnd yes, you're getting sued by women who didn't get up\nOut their seat on the bus, and feet shouldn't rust\nAnd beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust\nBut we do, I'm laughin' at the calendars and clocks\nAscot to match the socks, what's in your Speakerboxxx?\n\"Pink and Blue\", you're lollygaggin', you're slow pokin'\nYou got me open, you're playin' wit me, darlin I'm not a toy\nAs if Anita Baker brings the joy\nYour kind are the Tyner, meanin' the real McCoy\nI can't wait...\n[Verse 2: Sleepy Brown]\nI can't wait, I can't wait\nI can't wait, no I can't wait\nOoh baby, come home, got plans tonight\n(Plans tonight, plans tonight, plans tonight, plans tonight)\nAnticipatin', the love and I'm gon' get it 'til the mornin' light\n(Mornin' light, mornin' light, mornin' light, mornin' light)\nCome on, baby\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Sleepy Brown]\nI can't wait (the way you love me)\nI can't wait (the way you touch me)\nI can't wait (I can feel it)\nI can't wait (all over me)\nI can't wait (come on, baby)\nI can't wait (please come home)\nI can't wait (tonight)\nI can't wait (whoo)\n\n[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]\nFor your time, you're so fine\nYou're always on my mind\nCause baby I can't wait, I can't wait\nI can't wait, no I can't wait\nI'm so glad I found you\nI just wanna be around you\nI can't wait, I can't wait\nI can't wait, no I can't wait\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Sleepy Brown]\nOoh, it's been too long now baby, let's seize the night\n(Seize the night, seize the night, seize the night, seize the night)\nCause I'm gonna take you on a journey, enjoy the ride\n(Enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride)\nEnjoy the ride, up and down (ooh baby!)\nUp and down (whoo lady!)\nRound and round (take it)\nRound and round (whoo)\n\n[Chorus: Sleepy Brown]\nFor your time, you're so fine\nYou're always on my mind\nCause baby I can't wait, I can't wait\nI can't wait, no I can't wait\nI'm so glad I found you\nI just wanna be around you\nI can't wait, I can't wait\nI can't wait, no I can't wait\n\n[Post-Chorus: Sleepy Brown]\nThis is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)\nIn you, in you, in you\nThis is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)\nIn you, in you, in you\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nSir Luscious is the real deal but even he gets antsy\nSome honeys try to kill Bill beneath the underpants see\nBut patience is a virtue to being anxious, just might hurt you\nLike Mike Vick returning to the line of scrimmage too soon\nA line of niggas tryin' to get in Vision on a full moon\nShould I play it cool or be the one to make the first move?\nAnticipatin' and contemplatin', she got you sprung, dude\nShit, I'm finna get her, might even hit her, what you gon' do? (what?)\nI tell you what, we won't be fallin' for that one-two\nJust kinky sex up off in the Boom Boom if she want to\nAnd if she don't, then I'll dial another date\nThat means find another face to replace cause I can't wait\n\n[Outro: Sleepy Brown]\nThis is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)\nIn you, in you, in you\nI can't wait, I can't wait\nI can't wait, no I can't wait\nThis is dedicated to the lover (to the lover)\nIn you, in you, in you\nI can't wait, I can't wait\nI can't wait, no I can't wait7Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/430721", "artist_names": "Shania Twain", "full_title": "She's Not Just a Pretty Face by\u00a0Shania\u00a0Twain", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/f7b72d102d554ebc94cb935daab8992a.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f7b72d102d554ebc94cb935daab8992a.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 430721, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 354383, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1582398732, "path": "/Shania-twain-shes-not-just-a-pretty-face-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Shania-twain-shes-not-just-a-pretty-face-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2003, "month": 10, "day": 6}, "release_date_for_display": "October 6, 2003", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Oct. 6, 2003", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/dda9b80cbb7655c6775f6263e170f9d0.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/dda9b80cbb7655c6775f6263e170f9d0.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "She\u2019s Not Just a Pretty Face", "title_with_featured": "She's Not Just a Pretty Face", "updated_by_human_at": 1651073229, "url": "https://genius.com/Shania-twain-shes-not-just-a-pretty-face-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/139398", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/35b9d1ed275db5f9ddb8107fe9d19c5a.1000x333x1.jpg", "id": 139398, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e3fc1916d1616c07e23c5597363a65f9.400x400x1.jpg", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Shania Twain", "slug": "Shania-twain", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Shania-twain", "iq": 100}, "artist": "Shania Twain", "lyrics": "She\u2019s Not Just a Pretty Face Lyrics[Intro]\n(Oh na, na, na, na, na)\n\n[Verse 1]\nShe hosts a TV show\nShe rides the rodeo\nShe plays the bass in a band\nShe's an astronaut\nA valet at the parking lot\nA farmer working the land\nShe is a champion\nShe gets the gold\nShe's a ballerina\nThe star of the show\n[Chorus]\nShe's not just a pretty face\nShe's got everything it takes\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe has a fashion line\nA journalist for \"TIME\"\nCoaches a football team\nShe's a geologist\nA romance novelist\nShe is a mother of three\nShe is a soldier\nShe is a wife\nShe is a surgeon\nShe'll save your life\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's not just a pretty face\nShe's got everything it takes\nShe's mother of the human race\nShe's not just a pretty face\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nOh, oh-oh, yeah\nOh, na, na, na, na\nNa, na, na, na, na\nSee Shania Twain LiveGet tickets as low as $24You might also like[Verse 3]\nShe is your waitress\nShe is your judge\nShe is your teacher\nShe is every woman in the world\nOh, la, la, la, la, la\n\n[Verse 4]\nShe flies an airplane\nShe drives a subway train\nAt night, she pumps gasoline\nShe's on the council\nShe's on the board\nShe's a politician\nShe praises the Lord\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's not just a pretty face\nShe's got everything it takes\nShe's mother of the human race\nShe's not, oh\n\n[Outro]\nNo, she's (She's) not (not)\nJust a pretty face\nShe's (She's) got (Got) everything it takes\nShe's not just a pretty face\nShe's got everything it takes\nShe's not just a pretty faceEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 6, "api_path": "/songs/193598", "artist_names": "Britney Spears (Ft.

swear that I can't wait until they grow up\n[Chorus]\nThen they do, and that's how it is\nIt's just quiet in the morning\nCan't believe how much you miss\nAll they do and all they did\nYou want all the dreams they dreamed of to come true\nThen they do\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow the youngest is starting college\nShe'll be leaving in the Fall\nAnd Brianna's latest boyfriend\nCalled to ask if we could talk\nAnd I got the impression\nThat he's about to pop the question any day\nI look over at their pictures\nSitting in their frames\nI see them as babies\nI guess that'll never change\nYou pray all their lives\nThat someday they will find happiness\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Bridge]\nNo more Monday PTA's\nNo carpools, or soccer games\nYour work is done\nNow you've got time that's all your own\nYou've been

nothing like my neighborhood\nOut of all of the fancy satin and silk\nMy white cotton feels so good\nSearched high and low for a place\nWhere I can lay my burdens down\nAin't nothing in the whole wide world\nLike the peace that I have found\n[Chorus]\nIn the little things (in the little things)\nAnd the joy they bring\nIn the little things (its the little things)\nAnd the joy they bring\n\n[Verse 2]\nSimple as a phone call just to make it known\nThat you're gonna be a little late\nPure as a kiss on the cheek and a word\nThat everything will be okay\nCall in the morning from my little sister\nSinging to me happy birthday\nWhen you quest for fortune and fame\nDon't forget about the simple things\n\n[Chorus]\nIn the little things (its the little things)\nAnd the joy they bring\nIt's the little things (its the little things)\nAnd the joy\n\n[Bridge]\nGive some good food\nGive me some cute shoes\nGive me some peace of mind\nGive me some sunshine\nGive me some blue skies\nYou might

more\nWhen I asked to learn humility\nThis is what I was told\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's little things (its the little things)\nAnd the joy they bring\nIn the little things (its the little things)\nAnd the joy they bring\n\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\n\n[Outro]\nGive me my guitar, give me a bright star\nGive me some good news, give me some cute shoes\nGive me Atlanta, give me Savannah\nGive me my peace of my mind\nGive me some Stevie, give me some Donny\nGive me my Daddy, give me my Mommy\nPour me some sweet tea, spoonful of honey\nI don't need no HollywoodEmbed"},

Till the Juke done it.\nDown.\n\nLike Jukoleon, the seagoer, when he bore down in his perry boat he had raised a slide and shipped his orders and seized his pullets and primed their plumages, the fionnling and dubhlet, the dun and the fire, and, sending them one by other to fare fore fom, he had behold the residuance of a delugion: the foggy doze still going strong, the old thalassocrats of invinsible empores, maskers of the waterworld, facing one way to another way and this way on that way, from severalled their fourdimmansions.

Never to weaken up in place of the broths. Never to vvol-lusslleepp in the pleece of the poots. And, allerthings, never to ate the sour deans if they weren\u2019t having anysin on their consients. And, when in Zumschloss, to never, narks, cease till the finely ending was consummated by the completion of accomplishment.\n\nAnd thus within the tavern\u2019s secret booth The wisehight ones who sip the tested sooth Bestir them as the Just has bid to jab The punch of quaram on the mug of truth.\n\nK.C. jowls, they\u2019re sodden in the secret.

of the hundred bottles with the radio beamer tower and its hangars, chimbneys and equilines or, at least, he was\u2019nt actually the then last king of all Ireland for the time being for the jolly

Ireland, when he found him \u2014 self all alone by himself in his grand old handwedown pile after all of them had all gone off with themselves to their castles of mud, as best they cud, on footback,

vinnage on the brain, the unimportant Parthalonians with the mouldy Firbolgs and the Tuatha de Danaan googs and the ramblers from Clane and all the rest of the notmuchers that he did not care the royal spit out of his ostensible mouth about, well, what do you think he did, sir, but, faix, he just went heeltapping through the winespilth and weevily popcorks that were kneedeep round his own

and the supereminent lord of them all, overwhelmed as he was with black ruin like a sponge out of water, allocutioning in bellcantos to his own oliverian society MacGuiney\u2019s Dreans of Ergen Adams

change\nWaves goodbye as they pull away\nFrom the life he's known\nFor the last seven months or so\n\n[Chorus]\nShe said we found a man who looks like you\nWho cried and said he never knew\nAbout the boy in pictures that we showed him\nA rambler in his younger days\nHe knew he'd made a few mistakes\nBut he swore he would have been there had he known it\nSon, we think we found your dad in Oklahoma\n[Verse 2]\nA million thoughts race through his mind\nWhat's his name? What's he like?\nAnd will he be anything like the man in his dreams?\nShe could see the questions in his eyes\nWhispered, don't be scared, my child\nI will let you know what we know\n\n[Chorus]\nAbout the man we found, he looks like you\nWho cried and said he never knew\nAbout the boy in pictures that we showed him\nA rambler in his younger days\nHe knew he'd made a few mistakes\nBut he swore he would have been there had he known it\nYou always said that this was something that you wanted\nSon, it's time to meet your dad in Oklahoma\n\n[Bridge]\nOne last turn, he held his breath\nTill they reached the fifth house on the left\nAnd all at once the tears came rolling in\nAnd as they pulled into the drive\nA man was waiting there outside\nHe wiped the worry from his eyes\nSmiled and took his hand\nAnd he said\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI'm the man who looks like you\nWho cried because I never knew\nAbout the boy in pictures that they showed me\nA rambler in my younger days\nI knew I made a few mistakes\nBut I swear I would have been there had I known it\nNever again will you ever be alone\nSon, welcome to your home in OklahomaEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

moonlight and painted stars all across the sky\nIs it gravity or destiny?
