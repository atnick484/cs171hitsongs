vaccines and TV shows\nPolitics, celebrity gossip, popular neat quotes\nBlack lives, white lives, which lives mean most?\nWe only dedicate one day to remember our fallen soldiers\nThe men and women who died young\nBut if you come out the closet as Caitlyn Jenner\nYou're a hero and you get a whole pride month\nThe most dang\u0435rous pandemic's propaganda from these clowns\nOnly mask that's gonna sav\u0435 us is duct tape on they mouths\nDon't speak, we don't need to defund police\nNeed to defund the media who lies through they teeth, like\nBig pharma doesn't cure you, dawg\n'Cause every patient that gets cured is a customer lost\nAnd big oil runs the world, the only wars that get fought\nAre with the countries who have natural resources they want\nHeard 'em claiming if a white man braids his hair\nAnd likes rap, he's appropriatin' culture\nBut if a white man acts too white, he's white trash\nHe's a racist, he's a bigot, he's a monster\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's just have the conversation\nNot every Liberal is dumb, not all Republicans are racist\nThe government wants everybody fighting with their neighbors\n'Cause they know that if we get along, we'll probably go against 'em\n\n[Chorus]\nThey can't stop us\n'Cause we're ready to fight\nTry to brainwash us\nBut we won't let freedom die\nThe whole world's brainwashed\nEverybody pick a team, start a riot in the streets\nThe whole world's brainwashed\nIt's us against them, it ain't you against me\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow did monkeys become people and people turned into sheep?\nThey put fluoride in the water that's keeping us all asleep\nClaim they want what's best for us, I find that hard to believe\n'Cause they been selling us cigarettes since we was 18\nFake news, fake woke, distract, and divide\nYou're either right or you're left or you're black or you're white\nBig tech don't need a microchip to hack in your life\n'Cause the phone inside your pocket is a trackin' device\nAnd I don't know what I'm more sick of\nRappers or Joe Biden, looking like he ate a hundred Xanax for dinner\n'Cause censorin' the president and kicking him off Twitter\nIs a bigger threat to freedom than foreign ballistic missiles\nYou don't trust the police or the government\nBut you want people giving up their right to own a firearm\nWhy would you be comfortable if police and the government\nThe only people on the planet with the right to buy a gun?\nWhite privilege getting amplified to reinforce the vision\nIt convinces white people that they're favored by their skin\nAnd black people getting angry 'cause they're told they're treated different\nSo the conflict is between us and never with the system\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nLet's just have the conversation\nNot every Liberal is dumb, not all Republicans are racist\nThe government wants everybody fighting with their neighbors\n'Cause they know that if we get along, we'll probably go against 'em\n\n[Chorus]\nThey can't stop us\n'Cause we're ready to fight\nTry to brainwash us\nBut we won't let freedom die\nThe whole world's brainwashed\nEverybody pick a team, start a riot in the streets\nThe whole world's brainwashed\nIt's us against them, it ain't you against me\n\n[Bridge]\nStep one, train the people only to consume\nStep two, infiltrate adults with the news\nStep three, indoctrinate the children through the schools\nAnd the music and the apps on the phones that they use\nStep four, separate the right from the left\nStep five, separate the white from the black\nStep six, separate the rich from the poor\nUse religion and equality to separate 'em more\nStep seven, fabricate a problem made of lies\nStep eight, put it on the news every night\nStep nine, when people start to fight and divide\nTake control, this is called situational design\n[Chorus]\nThey can't stop us\n'Cause we're ready to fight\nTry to brainwash us\nBut we won't let freedom die\nThe whole world's brainwashed\nEverybody pick a team, start a riot in the streets\nThe whole world's brainwashed\nIt's us against them, it ain't you against me1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/6802729", "artist_names": "T-Pain &

someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself\nThere's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for\nBut it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door\nWhich is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more\nThan anyone before (Anyone before)\nToo bad they're usually deranged\n\n[Verse 2]\nLast week, I realized I crave pity\nWhen I retell a story, I make everything sound worse\nCan't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing\nAnd maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed\nWhich is ironic because when I wasn't honest\nI was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention just to get neglection)\nNow we're estranged\n[Chorus]\nThings I once enjoyed\nJust keep me employed now\nThings I'm longing for\nSomeday, I'll be bored of\nIt's so weird\nThat we care so much until we don't\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders\nBut I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong\nI'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor\nTo keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure\n'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise\nWould depend on what I'm given, mmm (Not on his permission)\n(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mmm\n\n[Chorus]\nThings I once enjoyed\nJust keep me employed now, mmm\nThings I'm longing for, mmm\nSomeday, I'll be bored of\nIt's so weird\nThat we care so much until we don't\n\n[Outro]\nBut next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughing\nFor anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine\nI've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna\nWas too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think

frente\nNo solo Bad tiene un \"X 100PRE\"\nPero yo le llego, solo dime (Pero dime)\nQue no me vaya\nCu\u00e9ntame si tiro la toalla\nO si la tiramos en la playa\nBaby, voy volando por si la se\u00f1al

about no time\nThat was before time, run on the opp, now it's your time\nClips is \u0435xtended for showtime\nWok\u0435 up, hit bro line\nBack out in traffic before nine\nWe load it up, went on both sides\nIt's different phases, I did it perfect, amazing\nBeen on them bitches with no minds\nI saw 'em bail out, headshot four times\nBaby mama fell on the floor crying\nWent on a hit, had to look before firing\n'Cause my auntie, she shot with they dope line\nLost too many niggas, when they died, I ain't even cry\nI ain't even feel it, I can't even lie\nStaying in my city, I might end up a homicide\nTwo gun cases 'cause I'm traumatized\nPlus the police wanna kill a nigga, I wonder why\nBulletproof 'lac when I'm coming by\nAin't no saving them boys, I'ma still be the one to try\nHopefully, ain't gotta kill one of mine\nYou might also like[Chorus: Polo G & Lil Tjay]\nStreets got 'em, ain't no saving them boys\nGrandma tryna pray to the Lord\nRaise hell if they take one of

couldn't miss bread, run that bag every day of the week, huh\nNigga try me and get hit dead, all of my young niggas playing for keeps, huh\nSo you better off focusing instead, better not go that way, it get deep, huh\nI'm smoking dummy, it's busting, this shit to the point that a nigga can't feel nothing\nNew opposition, I'm rushing, I told all my shooters might have to go kill something\nI lost a couple of soldiers, I keep going over so now I don't feel nothing\nCrying, I'm letting that steel drum\nWe gon' spin through the opps and they still run\n[Chorus: Polo G & Lil Tjay]\nStreets got 'em,

valuable\u2014\n\n[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]\nMassa couldn't catch me, my legs long than a bitch\nGot too much self-respect, I wash my hands 'fore I piss\nThey try to talk me\u2014, ehm, I'ma just go\n[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]\nYeah, when I turned twenty-three, that's when pub\u0435rty finally hit me\nMy facial hair started growin', my clothing ain't really fit m\u0435\nThat caterpillar went to cocoon, do you get me?\nSee, I was shiftin', that's really why Cherry Bomb sounded so shifty\nMy taste started changin' from what it was when they met me\nBut first impression is everything, ain't wanna let me go\nAlways curious as a child and askin' questions, so\nI ain't give no fucks, if, and, buts if they accept me\nYo, my boy Skateboard P gave me that speech in Italy session, um\nThankfully, by hour three it detoured perspective, um\nThoughts changed so rapid, turned to butterfly, Flower Boy happened\nAll the bees buzzed me, the bugs screamed they loved me\nFirst time I private airlined, accolades, song got airtime\nGrew into my style, body, and feelings, and fixed my hairline\nCalmed down in front of cameras, business hit tens of millions\nI'm not that little boy y'all was introduced to at one-nine\nMom was in the shelter when \"Yonkers\" dropped, I don't say it (I don't say it)\nWhen I got her out, that's the moment I knew I made it (Yeah, yeah)\nI don't come from money, they deny it\nSince I don't mirror the stereotypical products of my environment\nEight figures in taxes taken, that shit is stupid\nA flower gets its petal, they pluck it, but never use it\nIt's still potholes in the schools, where does it go?\nIt's still loopholes that I use, nobody knows\nYou might also like[Chorus: Tyler, The Creator]\nMassa couldn't catch me, my legs long than a

Drama]\nSeein' that we only get one life to live\nHow far do you really wanna take it?\nDon't let 'em ever tell you nothin' you can't do\n\n[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]\nYeah, I purchase more wheels when I feel like I'm third-wheelin'\nMy favorite part of the double R is the bird ceilin'\nThe panoramic view of the sky and the sun beamin'\nThat ray of light show that nobody is front-seatin'\nI'm on the hunt for perfect but decent is what I been on\nI know she fell in love, but commitment is not my end goal\nAnd all my friends that did got too comfy, a little chubby\nAnd that drive to make that money dried up when that nose was runny\nWe ain't gotta pay attention to the stuff that he battles\nEveryone I ever loved had to be loved in the shadows\nTug-of-war with X and Y felt like a custody battle\nFelt like the boat goin' down, it felt like I'm missin' a paddle\nMight buy that crib in Seattle covered in grass, lackin' gravel (Yeah)\nIt come with two boats and cattle, I'm livin'

fuckin' across the table, don't think anybody noticed\nYou asked me if I was comin' to city you from\nMaybe we should kick it, I was interested, that would be dumb\nIf I denied long legs, good ears, great taste\nSmell good, sense of humor, obvious a good face\nAnd we clicked, we was at each other's hips\nI ain't even wanna fuck 'cause your presence was enough\nYou and I make sense, you stayed back at my telly\nWe was chattin' 'til mornin', the vibrations was heavy\nI wasn't drownin' or yawnin', that's when I told you my feelings\nYou told me you felt the same, but you got homie you dealin' with\nDamn, I didn't know, that's a bit unexpected\nBut I get it, it's whatever, least I can do is respect it\nWe still gon' kick it and check-in like nothin' could ever stop it\nThe problem is he my friend, but if I'm honest, I'm really hopin' you drop him\nIt's morals I really have, it's lines I could never cross\nBut you got somethin' that make all them good intentions get lost\nI try to keep it together, never felt this way\nWe spent 'bout two weeks together, only skipped one day\nAnd they say, \"Bros over hoes,\" I'm like, \"Mm, nah, hey\"\nI would rather hold your hand than have a cool handshake\nBut whatever, we still could be friends, it could still be chance\nI'ma play it cool, we got somethin', we cannot pretend, uh, uh\n[Interlude]\nIt's, it's like starting a race\nAnd then when you take off, they like, \"No, no, it's not a end,\" ha\nIt was too late and shit\n\n[Verse 2]\nFaceTimin', it ain't 'bout nothin', you laughin', packin' your luggage\nIt's nothin' incriminatin', but please delete our discussions\nYou hit me with the look and replied like, \"Duh, bitch\"\nDon't want your man to think that we creepin' behind his back\nCross the line, cross the line, cross the\u2014 nah, we never did that\nThough I haven't seen him in months, shit is rare he never hit back\nAnyway, convince him to bring you to me so we could kick it\nRight in front of his lenses, nothing here is malicious\nYou sat by me in that movie, we went outside for them doobies\nWe walkin' off when we talk, man, that nigga not fuckin' stupid\nHe see it, he know it's somethin' we frontin' like, \"Ha-ha-ha\"\nWhenever we \"Ha-ha-ha,\" we subtly press his buttons\nNot on purpose, but, man, I found my purpose\nIf I fucked our friendship up for you, I think it's worth it\nBut, nah, I can't do that, that nigga don't deserve it\nAnd plus y'all got depth, I'm just the nigga on the surface, for real\nSurface\n\n[Interlude]\nI said surface, like, 'cause they got roots\nLike, I'm the new nigga\nBut you know, they be fuckin', haha\nYeah, yeah\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nDidn't see you a couple weeks, think he want you away from me\nKnow y'all argued 'bout if you mad you met him before you met me\nI feel guilty, but not as much as I should\nI tried to have that self-control, but not as much as I could\nI been down for days, you in my city and I can't see your face\nI can't eat knowin' you with him and not at my place\nI never been jealous of another man\nEspecially when I have everything I want at hand\nExcept you, you\n\n[Interlude]\nYou know, I got every damn car, multiple cribs\nBut it's like, \"No, I want that,\" ha\n\n[Verse 4]\nHe left for some days, I cleared out my sched', I cleared out my head\nYou dropped off at mine, I say that we fled, \"No, you pick a place\"\nWe could Tulum, or we could Capri, or die right here\nAs long as you with me, I'll be at peace, huh\nYou was supposed to go back home to see your bestie\nI told you I can't hit that zone, too busy next week\nYou was like, \"Hmm, I'll stay a week, she'll get over that\"\nSeven days with me, your nigga like, \"Where the fuck you at?\"\nDirtyin' my bakin' pots, tennis at my mama spot\nChauffeured in the Rolls, the back entrance for them restaurants\nParks playin' chess games, givin' wigs pet names\nManicures, night swims, Jerrod providin' methane\nShoppin' 'til we droppin', what you coppin'?\nSee, the price is not a option\nIt's investments 'cause your smile is the profit to me\nI know around him, you gotta act like you not into me\nI know your answer, but you gotta keep it honest with me\nSaid you can't fully be into me 'cause you with him\nThen why the fuck when we link it's like he doesn't exist?\nThey all know that we friends, but we both aware that it's more\nEverything I got, if you say the word, then it's yours\nThe only thing I'm missin' in life, I know you could be it\nAnd everyone around me that care about me can see it\nI could fuck a trillion bitches every country I done been in\nMen or women, it don't matter, if I seen 'em, then I had 'em\nBut with you, it's a feeling 'cause we twinnin' and we matchin'\nYou stayed in the car when I went on date with that actress\nWhole time I'm eatin', I couldn't wait to get back\nIn the back of the car with you and talk about who we are\nYou told me when you with me, it's like heroin\nTold me that your confidence went up since we befriended, and\nTold me that you didn't wanna hurt him, why we doin' this?\nTold me this a awkward situation and you just wanna be through with it\nTold me every time you not with him, it started problems, and\nTold me every time you not with me, you always ponder\nWhat type of sweater I'm wearin', what music have I been finding\nGirl, you know that I'ma play it whenever, that's what we bonded over\nYou said you told him the truth and you never lied\nNow he lookin' at you with them eyes\nWe never crossed the line, but he got every right to be a lil' pissed off\nHe picked you up, y'all got an argument, he got his shit off\nMy energy like, \"Get lost,\" your energy just want peace\nI couldn't even tell you his energy 'cause he don't speak\nHe ain't even call you his bitch\nUntil he see me make you smile, that nigga threatened as shit\nI'm in the wrong, though\nI picked you up, your energy off\nYour lips really dry, something is off\nYou ask if I gotta, I ask if you gotta\nWe trip on our words, nobody is lyin', hakuna matata\nWe sat in the car and cried for a hour\nMy shirt look like a showerhead got it, we called it off\nI'll skip the details but that night I seen hell\nYou was in a room I was payin' for, I took three Ls\nNo, I didn't sleep well, woke up and my knees fell\nThey buckled to the ground, I cannot walk, shit, I need Vill\nNext day I'm drivin' 'round the city with no destination back-up\nWater in my eyes kept falling like Niagara\nVill right beside me makin' sure I didn't crash or\nDo something heinous 'cause I'm emotionally jabbed up\nYou checked every box, I thought it was it\nFelt like I got led on and pushed off a cliff\nNo, I'm in the wrong, that was a friend\nNo, fuck that, the energy we had, never again will find it\nYou in the wrong, gotta remind you 'bout the times that you stepped\nGotta rewind it\u2014 aw, fuck\nWe talkin' 'bout our kinks, real cautious with the links\nYou don't do that type of shit when you in relationship\nAnd you a hundred with your mate, so don't go actin' like no saint\n'Cause it's a two-way street, and shit, you knew what I was on\nAnd while that nigga out and gone, shit, you was loungin' in my home\nShit, I even let you meet my mama and y'all got along\nBut shit, I'll take my L, though it's not fun\nYou still got your nigga and still had your fun\nShit, I can't even look at you and think about bad words\nThat's why I called and said we couldn't end this on bad terms\nWe straight like a bad perm, we'll always be good friends\nAnd laugh about it on a sandy beach while our back burns, huh\nThis my perspective, this how I feel\nI ain't fabricate nothin', I kept it real\nI told you I love you and always will\nAnd if he ever put his hands on you, promise I'll get him killed, true\nTrue, true, true, yeah\n[Outro]\nOn God, I love that girl, f\u2014 mhm\nI'm a sh\u2014 I'm a bad person, like, I'm in the wrong, I'm a bad person\nI had no ill intentions, though\nShit, everybody got hurt\nI got hurt, bruh\nIt's a shit situation\nAll the morals and power you have just vanish when a certain energy is nearing\nAnd those feelings got so much gravity and it's out of your control\nThat made me realize adults don't know what they doin' either\nWe're all just children\nI ain't mean to fuck nobody's shit up, man\nI thought I was bulletproof\nShe proved me wrong, man\nI felt two hundred percent with her\nIt was beautiful\nI was able to feel\nBut it was, it was bad timing\nAnd I'm mad private with this side of my life 'cause people are weirdos, and\nI just try to keep anyone I care about in the shadows\nSafe from the commentary and spotlight and thoughts\n'Cause it's just a story for the people outside of it\nBut I guess you're just another chapter in the book28Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/7748885", "artist_names": "Genius Swedish Translations", "full_title": "Tyler, The Creator - RISE! ft.

block like that's his favorite route\nAyy, lil' nigga, if you send some shots, you better make it count\nRPs touch his brain cells, rearrange his scalp\nThey killed Lamp, he took three with him, they all know what your name about\nAin't see you in so long, it's like your voice is slowly fadin' out\nLove my niggas right or wrong, no, I would never trade 'em out\nAin't thuggin' 'cause he mean it, these lil' niggas in a race for clout\nBlock died, we threw up X's, TimTim died, we thr\u0435w up T's\nTwin 'nem died, we bangin' L's, I wish that th\u0435y ain't never leave\nFor Killa, K's to the brain, I'm scorin' if I catch the G's\nForever stuntin' like I'm Durb, I keep a few tricks up my sleeve\n[Interlude]\nGod, I know I'm nothin' like them\nI'm just different, I'm built different\nI feel as if we all got a purpose and we all special in some way\nBut me, my potential is unmatched\nI'm the chosen one\nBut only time'll tell, long live the guys\nUh\n\n[Verse 2]\nSay, \"Fuck the opposites,\" but deep down, we really all alike\nSince the elementary, our elders gave us small advice\nThis shit could lead to death and jail, it's crazy how they all was right\nI was playin' AAU with Ed, it was ball is life\nWish I could've warned him in advance 'fore he lost his life\nGame time, call troopers for backup before we call for Christ\nWas real to him whole time while he sharpened his knife\nHe put it in my back for racks, ain't know his heart had a price\nEverything done in the dark gon' come to light\nTryna choose your thoughts over your feelings, that's the hardest fight\nHad to prove 'em wrong, they said my dreams was out of sight\nNow it's 50K up in my jeans on chartered flights\nAnd we rock the hardest ice\n\n[Outro]\nHolding back, no\nGo without you\nI don't

Lyrics[Intro]\nDamn Mikey\n\n[Chorus: Polo G]\nCold and abandoned, chills runnin' through her spine, just for thinkin' he won't\nI remember plans for forever, guess we won't get what we want\nTryna force myself not to care until I genuinely don't\nHeart of a giant, walkin' to the beat of my own drum, know they hate hearin' me stoned, uh\n\n[Verse 1: Polo G]\nI had dreams of touchin' ki's, no piano\nDon't fuck with me 'cause you feel like you got to\nSaid she writing someone name, her latest tattoo\nSaid I left her broken, I ain't try to\nBut whatever you want, you know I got you (I got you)\nArgum\u0435nts with my BM, she said a lot to hurt me\nI was goin' numb, but that was back when I was poppin' P\u0435rkys\nGrindin' hard for these fabrics, now I feel like Prada cursed me\nI'm tryna sell off my conscience, they sell off controversy\nCan't compare his numbers to mine, that's 'cause the block was thirsty\nOut in them trenches, stay a while, I keep a Glock with thirty\nThem members left a bloody scene, that's how our mob did dirty\nScore, fast breaks, hit up his body, they shot up his jersey\nThey keep forgettin' who got the city, might make copies of my stat sheet\nGet up close, knock out his grill, we don't rap beef\nHop out the car and turn that bitch into a track meet\nRunnin' from the graveyard, so we pack heat\n[Chorus: Polo G]\nCold and abandoned, chills runnin' through her spine, just for thinkin' he won't\nI remember plans for forever, guess we won't get what we want\nTryna force myself not to care until I genuinely don't\nHeart of a giant, walkin' to the beat of my own drum, know they hate hearin' me stoned, uh\n\n[Verse 2: Rod Wave]\nYoungin' was already the coldest, you just ain't know it\nToo many scars, heartbroken as he got older (Yeah, yeah)\nGlock in his pants, if he show it, he gonna blow it\nAll for them bands, he be rockin', he be rollin'\nAnd niggas, they got tension, but they beef be undercover though\nI can't lie, I miss it, but these bitches ain't one hunnid though\nI thought you was different, but you built just like these other hoes\nHad me in my feelings once I seen how your true colors show\nBut I carry on, act like I don't care 'bout that\nTried to change her last name to Green until I seen her heart was black\nTry my best to lead the team, life of a quarterback\nHeard the news about DeeDee, I damn near had a heart attack (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus: Polo G]\nCold and abandoned, chills runnin' through her spine, just for thinkin' he won't\nI remember plans for forever, guess we won't get what we want\nTryna force

anyone (I'm Harry, Harry Potter)\n\n[Verse 1]\nUh, let me tell you 'bout a young nigga, he was only fourteen\nDon't fuck with niggas, he stay social distanced like he quarantined\nWent from NBA to torn dreams\nAnd a street legend in between\nThat's when prayers made him hit his knees\nSee, he was born Cabrini-era back in '99\nOn Chicago North Side, where the news reportin' live\nHe can't help but rep his hood, damn near born on his block\nAnd his parents had him young, they ain't really have a lot\nSeen his daddy gang bangin', one day, he might take his spot\nFive years old and he taught him how to aim a Glock, uh\n\"Use that bitch to protect your family,\" that's what he told him\nA empty clip, he grabbed the gun and practiced what he showed him\nAnd his family hood famous, pop out, everybody know him\nAnd his people stuck for him so he won't let nobody ho him\nUncle's tellin' street stories, shit intriguin' like a poem\nSayin' shit like he'd put it to they neck if anybody owe him\nAll through his childhood, he was bad, but innocent\nPlayin' basketball with his homies, runnin' scrimmages\nThis who he cracked jokes, made a bond, and got suspended with\nAnd when they saw the opps, they fist-fought to settle differences\n'Til one day, the opps, they got tired of gettin' beat up\nThey big homies gave 'em guns like, \"Man, go and light they street up\"\nThey puttin' hoodies on, all black, loadin' heat up\nAdrenaline pumpin', now, they can't wait until they see us\nNormal day on the block, it was fun and all smiles\nBut his best friend Jacob wandered off from the crowd\nTook a walk to the store, headphones bangin' loud\nThen his opps bent the corner, he ain't see 'em come around\nWhen he looked up at the car, that's when them shots went, \"Baow\"\nBlood oozin' with his back on the ground\nVision blurry, heartbeat slowin' down\nBlood comin' out his mouth, feel like he startin' to drown\nTires screechin', last thing he heard was that sound\n\"Jacob just got shot,\" that's what a lady screamed\nNow everybody out of breath, runnin' to the scene\nSeein' Jacob on the floor, that was some shit they couldn't believe\nHis eyes rolling back, his auntie trying to tell him, \"Breathe\"\nDied 'fore the paramedics came, she cryin', \"Baby, please\"\nAin't even get to graduate 'cause he was only seventeen\nShorty cried all night, wishin' that shit was just a dream\n'Til that pain turned into anger, time to make a nigga bleed\n[Interlude]\nFuck, man\nThis nigga just took my best friend\nAnd I, I can't go for that shit\nIt got me fucked up\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd by the way, his name was Terrence, but they called him Sed\nDark skin, he wore a mean mug with some long dreads\nSix-two, he good at hawkin' niggas down, he got long legs\nNow he'll go and kill anybody that he want dead\nThey heard he caught his first body and that word spread\nAnd he know how quick karma come around, but he wasn't scared\nSacrificed his soul in them streets like Illuminati\nNow sellin' drugs and shootin' niggas, them his only hobbies\nBig driller now, he the one to call and go and catch a homi'\nGot the lo' on the nigga who killed his dawg, he want his second body\nA lightskinned heavy-set nigga named Rodney\nSay, \"He be out the west, off the Xans, movin' real sloppy\"\n\n[Interlude]\nYo, what's the word?\nMan, you won't believe who I found out the nigga who killed Jacob\nIt was the lil' nigga, Rodney\nHe be hangin' out up at the gas station on Pulaski, trying to make some money, nigga always out his mind\nOh, yeah?\nBet, say no more\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nSed pulled up to the lo', lights off, it's like one o'clock\nGrippin' on the silver Smith & Wesson with like thirty shots\nHe ain't gotta put one in the head, it's already cocked\nRodney got his back turned, he trying to sell his last rock\nSed hopped out the car, he ready to erase him\nRodney heard him comin', he gon' run before he let him fade him\nIt's like a demon in him 'cause his eyes red while he chase him\nRodney havin' some with regrets, now he just hopin' God save him\nShots to the leg, hollow tips ate him\nFell to the ground like his shoes, he ain't lace 'em\nSed walked up, stood over him like, \"Pussy, this for Jacob\"\nGave him four shots to the stomach, then he faced him\nSed runnin' to his car, Rodney bleedin' on the pavement\nHe had untied his hoodie and they seen that on surveillance\nTryna match him to the footage, the police investigatin'\nPlus they had his picture on the wall at the station\nA week later, they had came and grabbed him from his mama house\nCouldn't afford a lawyer in the county, fighting drama now\nSaid, \"Fuck it, takin' it to trial\", he ain't coppin' out\nJudge gave him forty-nine years, now that's a lot to count\n\n[Outro]\nNow, prosecutors were asking for the judge to lock him up for up to twenty-five years\nThe judge gave him twenty-eight\nSmith had the last word\nAgain, he was sentenced to twenty-eight years in prison\nHe has thirty days, Kelly, to appeal that sentence, back to you28Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/6869636", "artist_names": "Lil

state (My worst fear)\nI'm still healin' from some scars (Like what?)\nMy daddy called me on my birthday\nDidn't even tell me, he just asked me for some cake\nWhenever you speak your mind, they say you crazy and call you fake (I ain't)\nThought I was through sippin', but bruh got off papers today (For what?)\nAin't skipped no line, I sacrificed, now I'm havin' my way (Just look)\nDon't need no therapist, I vent to myself in my safe (Money talk)\nNiggas sayin' they gon' slide for me, but ain't bust they own fire\nMy opps ain't even worth killin'\nThat don't change the fact they need to die\nShow us the name, I stand on business (How), put 'em in a suit in tie\nDelta switched the suspects, shot once\nVictim hit a lot of times\nWhen I lost E-Long it rained hard that day outside\n[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]\nI'ma keep this shit so street with 'em, you can do this shit for clout\nHow the fuck you say you real when everything I see is cap?\nIf I got paid for what they think 'bout me, I prolly lose the count\nDon't need promo at this point, 'cause they gon' do that word of mouth\n\n[Verse 2: Polo G]\nNigga, I was ten toes on the front even when the snow was fallin'\nI used to always have a vision, me and bro was ballin'\nBut if he ain\u2019t mean it, thinkin' maybe he ain\u2019t wanna cross me\nSo many people come and go, it's like that door revolvin'\nAt my first re-pass at nine, then I started goin' often\nLamp had a frown on his face, like he ain't wanna coffin\nKnow my lil' son gotta eat, so I'm a workaholic\nIf this ain't greatness, then I really don't know what to call it\nBro was sixteen, think his killer 'round the same age\nThe hood cried when twin 'nem died, I felt the same rage\nBut we gon' lose if we ain't never on the same page, hmm\nGotta keep my head up 'til them days fade\n\n[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo & Lil Durk]\nI'ma keep this shit so street with 'em, you can do this shit for clout\nHow the fuck you say you real when everything I see is

Lyrics[Intro: Future]\n(Wheezy outta here)\n\n[Verse 1: Lil Baby]\nI used to couldn't see this far\nDamn, look how them tables turned\nThink I walk on water, but I never let no bridges burn\nIt's different when it's given to you\nAll the money, I really earned it\nAnd ain't no one's business, why the fuck am I still they concern?\nAin't the one for trippin', I keep pushin', I'm like lesson learned\nI ain't missin' my shot in this shit, everyone don't get a turn\nI was thinkin' street, I wanted everyone in verts and Rovers\nNow I really see and I got everyone convertin' over\nStudio, I'm stayin' at the microphone 'til the session over\nNiggas know we came with a lot of strong, took our section over\n(Took our section over)\n[Chorus: YTB Trench]\nI know it hurt, but you still told me that you lied\nWe made it work, but you still found the ways around it\nExtended verse, somehow, we still ain't see the high\nI paid the fine, and pay that iron between that line, I smoke that fire\nI know it hurt, but you still told me that you lied\nWe made it work, but you still found the ways around it\nExtended verse, somehow, we still ain't see the high\nI paid the fine, and I'd do it again\n\n[Verse 2: Young Thug & Gunna]\nHalf a million dollars on me, I feel it in my chromosomes\nI don't talk to that bitch, when we meet up, she know I'm only bone\nLifetime, send it, I made millions without a mobile phone\nTwo hundred thousand stacked up I could bought myself, you need a drone\nTryna put my people on, put my heart in every song\nThugger told me, \"That bitch heart ain't right, you need to leave her 'lone\"\nShe a dime, but she ain't got a diamond, that don't make no sense\nI don't care, don't waste no time, my next one gon' be heaven-sent\nRan me up some mils, now I'm not comin' off the bench\nI been patiently waitin' on my turn, just tell me when is it?\nI can spin 'em like Big Worm or Vick, I feed 'em to the pits\nYeah, my whole life has turned, I think I'm gettin' followed by a journalist\nI think my life done finally shifted, we on a yacht, look like a ship\nI prayed to God to get you hips, and then I got your titties lifted\nNever like to fuss and fight, but you throw fists in like they trip\nAnd then seduce me with your lips and I enjoy it\nYou might also like[Chorus: YTB Trench]\nI know it hurt, but you still told me that you lied\nWe made it work, but you still found the ways around it\nExtended verse, somehow, we still ain't see the high\nI paid the fine, and pay that iron between that line, I smoke that fire\nI know it hurt, but you still told me that you lied\nWe made it work, but you still found the ways around it\nExtended verse, somehow, we still ain't see the high\nI paid the fine, and I'd do it again\n\n[Verse 3: YTB Trench]\nYou say that you need a friend\nHold up, lil' bitch, come again\nKnow you may not know my name\nBut my net worth a fuckin' M\nAnd that's just what the people know\nWe move like a pick and roll\nSix shots behind screen, wait 'til that three, they comin' at your soul\nThat lil' bitch a freak (Yeah)\nShe gon' eat with my Pateky on\nI came from the streets, she know I'm G\nWhat she wan' sex me for\nIced out all my P's, down to my C's\nPut all my brothers on\nI took out my piece, that bitch a freak\nShe say she love it on\nI know she just wanna fuck 'cause I'm rich now\nI ran to the top, ain't stunt on shit\nAin't make no pitstops\nI ran up the mon' and make it flip\nSomethin' like TikTok\nThuggin' in a brick house\nPookie servin' Chris Rock\n[Outro: YTB Trench]\nIf I knew how to spin a bend\nThen I'd spin again\nWe hit a slide every time (Slide out)\nAnd slide out2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/6711690", "artist_names": "Genius Russian

(Taylor\u2019s Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nOnce upon a time\nI believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye\nAnd we caught onto something\nI hold onto the night\nYou looked me in the eye and told me you loved me\nWere you just kidding?\n'Cause it seems to me\nThis thing is breaking down, we almost never speak\nI don't feel welcome anymore\nBaby, what happened? Please tell me\n'Cause one second it was perfect\nNow you're halfway out the door\n[Chorus]\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said, \"Forever and always\"\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWas I out of line?\nDid I say something way too honest, made you run and hide\nLike a scared little boy?\nI looked into your eyes\nThought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure\nSo here's to everything coming down to nothing\nHere's to silence that cuts me to the core\nWhere is this going?\nThought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said, \"Forever and always\"\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\n'Cause I was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\nYou didn't mean it baby, I don't think

(Taylor\u2019s Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nYou're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset\nShe's going off about something that you said\n'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do\nI'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night\nI'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like\nAnd she'll never know your story like I do\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts\nShe's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers\nDreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find\nThat what you're looking for has been here the whole time\n[Chorus]\nIf you could see that I'm the on\u0435 who understands you\nBeen here all along, so why can't you see?\nYou b\u0435long with me, you belong with me\n\n[Verse 2]\nWalking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans\nI can't help thinking this is how it ought to be\nLaughing on a park bench, thinking to myself\nHey, isn't this easy?\nAnd you've got a smile that could light up this whole town\nI haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down\nYou say you're fine, I know you better than that\nHey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe wears high heels, I wear sneakers\nShe's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers\nDreaming about the day when you wake up and find\nThat what you're looking for has been here the whole time\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you could see that I'm the one who understands you\nBeen here all along, so why can't you see?\nYou belong with me\nStanding by and waiting at your back door\nAll this time how could you not know, baby?\nYou belong with me, you belong with me\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $299You might also like[Bridge]\nOh, I remember you driving to my house\nIn the middle of the night\nI'm the one who makes you laugh\nWhen you know you're 'bout to cry\nI know your favorite songs\nAnd you tell me 'bout your dreams\nThink I know where you belong\nThink I know it's with me\n\n[Chorus]\nCan't you see that I'm the one who understands you?\nBeen here all along, so why can't you see?\nYou belong with me\nStanding by and waiting at your back door\nAll this time how could you not know, baby?\nYou belong with me, you belong with me\n\n[Outro]\nYou belong with me\nHave you ever thought just maybe\nYou belong with me?\nYou belong with me23Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 8, "api_path": "/songs/6674078",

doors\nIt's the mornin' of your very first day\nYou say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while\nTry and stay out of everybody's way\nIt's your freshman year and you're gonna be here\nFor the next four years in this town\nHopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say\n\"You know, I haven't seen you around before\"\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out\nWell, count to ten, take it in\nThis is life before you know who you're gonna be\nAt fifteen\n[Verse 2]\nYou sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail\nAnd soon enough, you're best friends\nLaughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool\nWe'll be outta here as soon as we can\nAnd then you're on your very first date and he's got a car\nAnd you're feelin' like flyin'\nAnd your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one\nAnd you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends\nWhen the night ends\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen and your first kiss\nMakes your head spin around, well\nIn your life you'll do things greater than\nDatin' the boy on the football team\nI didn't know it at fifteen\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen all you wanted was to be wanted\nWish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now\nBack then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday\nBut I realized some bigger dreams of mine\nAnd Abigail gave everything she had\nTo a boy who changed his mind\nAnd we both cried\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $299You might also like[Chorus]\n'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you\nYou're gonna believe them\nAnd when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall\nBut I've found time can heal most anything\nAnd you just might find who you're supposed to be\nI didn't know who I was supposed to be\nAt fifteen\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la\nLa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la\nLa-la-la, la-la-la\n\n[Outro]\nYour very first day\nTake a deep breath, girl\nTake a deep breath as you walk
