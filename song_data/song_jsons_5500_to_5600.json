were times I didn't think I'd make it through alone\nI went through so many phases, that got me so many cases\nThree strikes you're gone, then what you gonna do?\nI guess I'll call my lady, and tell her to kiss my baby\nThey tell me that crime is all I know how to do\nNever leave me alone\nTell him his daddy's sorry, alone\nLet him know all about me\nThere's one more thing I'd really like you to do\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Val Young]\nNever leave me alone, never leave me alone\nLeave me alone never leave me alone\nNever leave me alone\nNever leave me alone, leave me alone\nNever leave me

miss my baby boo\nAnd my nigga Spanky too\nIt's true that the dirt I did from an O.G. to a snotty nose kid\nGot me caught up in the rapture like maze, days gone by\nAnd real G's gon' cry\nBut I try to walk the yard with my head to the sky\nAnd hope my baby boo ain't fuckin' niggas on the outside\nBut what's the chance that it ain't crackin'?\nIf I was out and she was in I'd probably be mackin'\nI can't lie so I say I would, now my girl in a world of playa hood\nA playa should show a nigga love and look out\nBut the niggas I know would probably turn your ass out\nSo keep away, better yet stay away\nAnd hope I get out one day, okay\nBut if I don't, I guess this is home\nMy girl is trippin' she got a block on her phone\n\n[Chorus: Nate Dogg & Val Young]\nNever leave me alone\nWill I be left

it\nAnd peace to you fuckin' alcoholics, for\nMakin' the proper remedy\nCuz when I hit it, bitches envy me\nSay you want wine? Yeah, I guess that's fine\nBut thai is the sky when you talkin' about mines\nNow my thai got a friend named Gin\nGot me all straight now my dick won't bend\nNow I'm fucked for the rest of the night\nUnless I find a piece of ass whether it's loose or tight\nNow looka here looka here I done found a bitch\nYummy for the dick, Jelly mix in the switch\nSave that shit cuz I don't wanna be your man\nJust need a little loosin', do you understand?\n[Hook (x2)]\nMy mind's fucked up off chocolate thai\nHit the gin shop now I'm so high\nNow I need a bitch that's proper and fly\nSo break me off a piece of that sweet potato pie\n\n[Verse 2]\nThinkin' about what I'm gonna do today\nParty at my homies bout eight\nI thought about goin' to the movies\nBut ain't nothin' like a bunch of proper ass hoochies\nDressed like a player can't wear nothin' less\nSome simple ass shit, even if it ain't Guess\nTake  a couple of shots and now I roll to the spot\nBitches straight peepin' wanna know what I got, well\nOne, two, three, Here comes the D\nPass me the buddah, OOOOH WEEE!!!!\nAnd now I'm ready for you bitches\nSo gang a dick licker, do you get the picture?\nAnd so much love for ya gals\nAnd peace, love, and pussy to my muthafuckin' pals\nAnd ay, yai, yai, I'mma stay high\nAnd keep me a piece of that sweet potato pie\n\n[Hook (x2)]\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nThe fellas wanna have a barbecue tonight, I think it's on about five\nThey say it's gonna have plenty Daisy Dukes, and Les says it's gonna be live\nSo Imma gonna grab me a player suit, cuz ain't a damn thing changed\nAnd now I'm proper and fly and shit, but man do I feel strange\nSo Imma go down to the liquor store, and find my friend named Gin\nAnd go to the girl with the flyest thai, and break her off a proper twin\nAnd now it's time to make some shit, and look for the proper mix\nAnd run a little game on the PYT, and tell it to her somethin' like this\n\n[Hook (x2)]1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5,

ain't the name calling game\nSee, I can refrain from using names to get fame\nSince I'm known to create the kinds of beats that make your rump shake\nRecords are great, but now let's set the record straight\n(They thought you was a sellout)\nI'm sellin' out tours 'cause sellin' CDs, I'm the one MB\nYou wanna beat the G, I beat you like hizzos\nIn the backseat of my Caddy you'll be callin' me Hammer Daddy\n\nI'll work you like a slave\nMisbehavin' you were gonna\nPay tax on one of my brothers' souls\nHit the street, caught up in your deuce\nAnd I refuse to forget that alright you talked tough\nBut face to face was a just a trick, bro\n\nThey put me in the mix, too legit to quit\nI came wit' a long list of it\nAnd in the future you'll find me on the billboard\nOr on the floor of the sign receiving music awards\nAnd it's all good\n\n(Hey)\n(It's all good)\nY'all ready for this?\n(Uh huh, it's all good)\n(Hey)\n(It's all good)\nY'all ready for this?\n(Uh huh)\nYou might also likeIt's all good\nThe talk you been talkin'\nTo talk that talk\nYou gotta walk that walk\nOh, the Hammer man's talkin'\nSo enter the dragon\nAnd once you burned up\nThose that caught in the dis-Hammer bandwagon\n\nSuckers, read Billboard and weep\nYou're in a hot seat, where I'm from, talk is cheap\nAnd when I see ya, the styles you wrote man\nA mean left hook took ya out, and it came from Oakland\n\nCheck it, you punks don't know me\nA true OG, yo, I was runnin' the whole scene\nYou started talking that mess but I'm callin' your bluff trick\nI thought you knew and boy you still can't touch this\n\nIt's better than the average bro\nI'm not the average Joe with the average flow\nYo, I can still do things that you wish you could\nYou're talkin' all that lip, but I don't even trip\n'Cause it's all good\n\n(Hey)\n(It's all good)\nY'all ready for this?\n(Uh huh, it's all good)\n(Hey)\n(It's all good)\nY'all ready for this?\n(Uh huh, it's all good)\n(It's all good)\nY'all ready for this?\n(Uh huh, it's all good)\n(It's all good)\nY'all ready for this?\n(Uh huh)\n\nI'm fed up, so now I gotta set 'em up\nKnock 'em to the ground and never ever let 'em up\nBut like a trick he might kick I'll be prepared to red 'em up\nHowever, if you wanna slang 'em, then we can get 'em up\n\nBlack sheep, you're weak, you're meek, you're tryin' to grow feet\nDres I make ya look head but first, I'mma get your teeth\nTalkin' about my mama's where I draw the line Redman\nDancin' with the corners of yo dome I'mma blow your mind, so!\n\nSince I'm not the run of the mill\nI feel the need to say you wanna be, you gotta be real\n'Cause if ya ever come my way like I used to say\nHomeboy you better pray just to make it today\n\nI know what it is\nThe ratta tat piece of corny rhymes you keep sayin' we don't find worth playin'\nI don't feel like I'm a gangsta so you claim that I'm a sellout\nWhen we meet up on the street, then we'll see who bail out\nAnd it's all good\n\n(Hey)\n(It's all good)\nY'all ready for this?\n(Uh huh, it's all good)\n(Hey)\n(It's all good)\nY'all ready for this?\n(Uh huh, it's all good)\n\n(Hey)\n(It's all good)\nY'all ready for this?\n(Uh huh, it's all

see\nIt's like animal attraction\nWhen you add it up\nIt's just a matter of factions, girl\n\n[Chorus:]\nSomething in your eyes told me\nThat you were looking for a man you could adore\nSomething in your eye\nHad given me a sign\nAnd I knew it was on\nI knew it was on\n\n[Verse 2:]\nYou think you're dry\nI say you're wet\nI can make it possible\nI can make it true\n\nAnd all night long\nI'll make you sweat\nGonna do a feeling\nThat's long past overdue\n\nAnd I know you think\nWhy so much confidence\nWhat kind of man must I be?\nYou might also likeIt's clear to see\nIt's like adding and subtracting\nWhen you add it up\nIt's just animal attraction\n\n[Repeat Chorus x2:]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nSo when I get inside\nAnd make you wet\nI'll lick you dry\nCreate your body weak\nFrom all the body heat\n\nAnd like a lion\nYou'll hear me roar\nAnd when I feed it to your body\nMake that body\nGet weak some more\n\nI'll take you to the peak\nI'll make you wanna scream\nAnd like a lion\nYou'll hear my body\nRoar and roar\nAnd roar and roar and roar\n[Repeat Chorus x3:]\n\n[Verse 4:]\nAnything is possible\nAnd anything can be\nYou can feel a passion you never dreamed of\n\nSee it in your eyes\nYou've given me a sign\nAnd I knew it was on\nI knew it was on\n\nIt was something in your eyes\nThat took me to feel it\nSomething in your eyes\nAnd hey, I can see it\n\nSomething in your

Cat, him a DJ tonight\nSay hold tight, tight and everyting is alright\n[Verse 1: Mac Daddy]\nThe day seems nice and bright and everything feels alright\nWent to school without a fool tryin' to pick a fight\nI was loced out Kris Kross shirts and khakis\n(Lookin' and feelin' like nothin' but a Mac, see...)\nThe bell rang and I got my dash\nFellin' good cause it was the last day of school, and I passed\nNo moms trippin', so me and my mom went dippin'\nTo celebrate the fact that I wasn't slippin'\nThe downtown scene was packed\nPeople screamin' from they ride to my ride and to the Mac\nI says \"I am what I am, that's who I be\"\nAnd yall should have seen how they was tryin' to get to me\nCool, cause dissin' and no pay\nThey're the reason why we are who we are to this very day\nAnd all that love keeps me and Chris tight\nLong as we give some love back everything's alright\n\n[Chorus: Super Cat]\nHold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...\nHold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...\nTell them Mista Cat, and him haffi hold tight\nTell them Kriss Kross, everyting is alright\nCome in the place and you feeling right\nThey come in the place and you hold your girl

hood\nAnd I see the one that used to do the dirt then turned good\nLittle kids try to be like me...\n(With the braids, the shades, some pants and some Nikes, G)\nAnd nothin' mo' better then a letter sayin'\n\"I'm your number one fan could you write me back man?\" Yesssss!\nI try to pass 'em my autograph\nI try to do as many as I can\nNow it feels good when I'm rollin' through my hood\nAin't nobody dissin' and a nigga thinks he's too good\nCause I'm down like four flat tires\n(Just a little nappy headed kid from the proj)\nShowin' I can do right and not do wrong\nRepresentin BG's and comin' up strong, and...\n(We ain't got no love for the side)\nWe only love those who love us back, right?\n\n[Chorus: Super Cat]\nHold tight, hold tight, tell 'em haffi hold tight...\nHold tight,

and you hold your girl tight\nTell them Mista Cat, him a DJ tonight\nSay hold tight, tight and everyting is alright\n[Verse 3: Mac Daddy]\nNow people seem to think what I do is a blast\nCause I'm always on the road and I'm makin' some cash\nBut they don't know, really d'know\nThe pressure it is for some kids tryin to make it in this here biz\nEarly mornin' interviews then we step to school\nStep from school, back to interviews then it's on to other dues\nSo, warm it up Chris?\nI said \"Ya warm it up Chris?\"\nThat's what I was born to do!\n\n[Verse 4: Daddy Mac]\nNow throw your hands in the air and wave from side-to-side\nIf the feelin' thatcha feelin', is the feelin' of pride\nSee, I ain't come out wack I came out right\nUnlike those moles who tried to \"Pass Da Mic\"\nIt's the Daddy Mac (Big baby!)\nEverything is real but you wanna diss cause a nigga sold a couple mill\n(Look here...) Ya can't say nothin' if ya last in a line\nSo when you diss it just lets me know I'm on your mind, and it's alright\n\n[Outro: Super Cat]\nHold tight, hold tight, every posse hold tight\nHold tight, hold tight, every posse hold tight\nIt no matter if you\u2019re black, it no matter if you\u2019re white\nJust come in de house make we all unite\nTell dem Kriss Kross and dem a drop on de mic and make we dance until the morning light\nTell dem Kriss Kross a de people\u2019s choice we haffi dance until de day light\nYour girl inna de place and your hold her tight and dance to the people\u2019s

of a homie is\nA friend till the end but some start when you're kids\nLittle traviesos that are always into something\nDoing something bad, acting like they did nothing\nWell here's a little story about a homie named Frankie\nHad another little homie that was down for hanky panky\nSort of like Spanky and Alfalfa, Little Rascals\nDoing what they doing getting away without a hassle\nLike going to the schoolyard for your late passes to class\nCutting in lunch lines leaving other students last\nAnd strolling to the movies to see a rated \"R\"\nWhen mom's dropped them off it's where E.T. would be the star\nStill, it was an issue that just could not be ignored\nTaking tapes and 45's from the local record store\nBeing good kids to them was nothing but bologna\nCause this is what you do when it's you and your homies\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2: DTTX]\nMy situation with my homies wasn't all fun\nSometimes sad, sometimes bad, but had to have one\nI wouldn't change it for a thing cause it's priceless\nYour homies are your down, yup!  Can I get a righteous\nAs kids, we saw and we did what most kids never did\nTook my first swig chilling at my homies crib\nSearching for ways, so that we could make presidents\nLife was hard being a product of my residence\nBut me beign the youngest, I had to stay strong\nMom's was my teacher cause Pop's was already gone\nHung out in the streets doing my own thing\nLiving in the varrio, but I never gangbanged\nComing up was a must, growing up with who I grew up\nI found out just who I can trust\nMe, Myself, and I not fronting like a phony\nI'm true to the game and I'm down with my homies\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3: ODM & DTTX]\nYou wanna be my homie, well hey I'll tell you something\nHanging with my crew doesn't really mean nothing\nBlabbing when I get all toured doing my songs\nYou gonna want to kick it, well listen up here holmes\nIt goes way back before you ever knew me\nI hung with my friends and not male groupies\nJust goes to show everybody where I'm coming from\nHey yo! D' break em off something\nYou might also likeSo many people wanna hang now that I'm in the rap game\nThey say that they're down when they dont even know my name\nWell I could say that I have many friends\nBut a homie is true, through and through until the end\nAnd ain't a damn thing changed\nWe're still hanging in the hood and doing the same thangs\nCause I ain't one to be a phony\nI'm still true to the game and I'm down with my homies\n\n[Chorus]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/963368", "artist_names": "Shabba Ranks (Ft.

call me up\nAnd you an' I can talk for hours and hours at a time\nThis as an invitation\nTo a conversation\nSo when things get bad you know I'll be there to soothe your mind\nJust call me up on the telephone\nWhen you're all alone\nAnd I'll give you a verbal massage\nUntil your man gets home\nOr if you want to you know what you could do, well\nYou could always hop in your car and you could come and ring my bell\n[Chorus]\nCome and ring my bell, ring my bell\n(my bell, ding-dong, ding-dong)\nCome and ring my bell, ring my bell\n(my bell, ring-a-ling-a-ling)\n\n[Verse 2]\nGirl the way he treats you it's a crying shame\nLike you're a toy and like your life is just some silly game\nHow long you gonna live in a situation like this\nCause you're a princess baby and you deserve a prince\nWhy can't you see it, it's plain as day right here before your eyes\nI'm telling the truth while your man insists on telling you lies\nHe stays out all night but I'd be home by 8\nAnd oh and about loving, hmm it's grrrrrrreat\nI don't mean to insult your man up\nBut I'm trying to plan the\nRest of our lives together forever and ever\nBut first you got to stand up\nPick yourself up on your own two\nCause girl don't nobody own you\nYou don't feel well and I can tell\nBut I'll be here so ring my bell\n\n[Chorus]\nYou might also likeBREAK!\nYou can ring my bell, you can ring my bell\nDing dong ding, hey-hey, ring it\nYou can ring my bell, anytime, anyplace\nRing it (you)\nRing it (you)\nRing it, ring it Ahhh\n\n[Verse 3]\nOpen up your mind and you can see that I'm\nJust trying to make you happy\nAnd like I said a 1000 times\nIf you didn't love me you wouldn't be calling me up every night\nTo wipe your tears 'cause you and your man just had another fight\nWho loves ya baby, I do\nYou know he doesn't care about you, let him go\nWhere's he at now, you don't know\nLaying up under some hooo-ld up, wait, just let me chill\nNo need for me to get ill\n'cause every time your heart gets knocked over\nYou know I'll wipe the spill\nI know this sounds like a fairy tale\nBut this ain't no children's book\nI'm here, for you to take me dear\nJust open your eyes and look\nAt what the future holds for you and\nIf you _ then you might ruin something great\nDon't make a big mistake\nPay attention to what you're doing\nLife is full of pitfalls, ups and down\nIt's sort of a mission\nNow you're on a rocky road\nBut you can get off\nJust make that decision\nThat you want someone to love you, adore you and hold you and treat you well\nSo when you're ready to be treated that way, baby you can ring my bell\n[Chorus]\n(Repeat till fade)Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/153801", "artist_names": "Van Halen", "full_title": "Top of the World

Lyrics[Verse 1: Pebbles]\nDeep in the heart\nLove has many ways\nOf touching your emotions\nTaking control of you\nAnd even in thought\nLove can make you change\nThere's no way of controlling love\nWhen it's part of you\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Babyface]\nWell, you could be a married man\nWith two kids and a good woman\nAnd you could give your heart and soul\nI swear it don't mean nothing\n'Cause love can pull you deep into a spell\nIt will spin your mind around like a carousel, oh\n[Chorus: Pebbles & Babyface, Pebbles, Babyface]\nI'm telling you love, boy, makes things happen\nYou never know where it's coming from\nYou never know who you're gonna love\n(Who you're gonna love)\nI'm telling you love\nMakes things happen\n(Makes it)\nYou never know what you're gonna do\n(Never)\nWhenever true love takes hold of you\n(You)\n\n[Verse 2: Babyface with Pebbles]\nThere's never a time\n'Cause love will let you know\nLove appears at the worst\nAnd even the best of times\nTakes over your mind\nYour heart is not your own\nThere's no way of controlling love\nIt controls your life\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Pebbles, Babyface, Both]\nWell (Woo), you could be a faithful girl\nWith a good heart and good intentions\n(Well, well)\nAnd you could never leave your home\nI swear there ain't no preventions\n(No way)\n'Cause love can pull you deep into a spell\nIt will spin your mind around like a carousel, oh\nYou might also like[Chorus: Pebbles & Babyface, Pebbles, Babyface]\nI'm telling you love, boy, makes things happen\nYou never know where it's coming from\n(You never know, baby)\nYou never know who you're gonna love\n(Who you're gonna love, boy)\nI'm telling you love (I never knew)\nMakes things happen\n(I'm telling you)\nYou never know what you're gonna do\n(You, you, you never know)\nWhenever true love takes hold of you\n\n[Bridge: Babyface, Pebbles]\nThere's nothing love can't make you do\nWhen love takes hold of you\nYou can have the purest heart\nAnd the finest attitude\n\nBut I swear that don't mean nothing (Nothing)\nWhen your heart's under the spell\nIt will spin your mind around like a carousel, oh, oh\n\n[Chorus: Pebbles & Babyface, Pebbles, Babyface]\nI'm telling you love makes things happen\n(Love, love, love, love)\nYou never know where it's coming from\n(Where it's coming from now)\nYou never know who you're gonna love\n(Who you're gonna love now)\nI'm telling you love (Sweet love, sweet love)\nMakes things happen (Love)\nYou never know what you're gonna do\n(What you're gonna do now)\nWhenever true love takes hold of you (Ah baby)\n[Outro: Pebbles & Babyface, Pebbles, Babyface]\nYou never know\nYou never know it\nYou never know\nYou're never gonna know it, baby, ooh\nWho you're gonna love\nWho you're gonna love, baby\nYou

Lyrics[Intro]\nDirty, rotten, filthy, stinkin'...\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's my cherry pie\nCool drink of water, such a sweet surprise\nTastes so good, make a grown man cry\nSweet Cherry Pie\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, swingin' on the front porch, swingin' on the lawn\nSwingin' where we want 'cause there ain't nobody home\nSwingin' to the left and swingin' to the right\nIf I think about baseball, I'll swing all night, yeah\nYeah, yeah\nSwingin' in the living room, swingin' in the kitchen\nMost folks don't 'cause they're too busy bitchin'\nSwingin' in there 'cause she wanted me to feed her\nSo I mixed up the batter and she licked the beater\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI scream, you scream, we all scream for her\nDon't even try 'cause you can't ignore her\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's my cherry pie\nCool drink of water, such a sweet surprise\nTastes so good, make a grown man cry\nSweet cherry pie, oh, yeah\nShe's my cherry pie\nPut a smile on your face, ten miles wide\nLooks so good, bring a tear to your eye\nSweet cherry pie\n\n[Verse 2]\nSwingin' to the drums, swingin' to guitar\nSwingin' to the bass in the back of my car\nAin't got money, ain't got no gas\nBut we'll get where we're goin' if we swing real fast\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI scream, you scream, we all scream for her\nDon't even try 'cause you can't ignore her\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's my cherry pie\nCool drink of water, such a sweet surprise\nTastes so good, make a grown man cry\nSweet cherry pie, oh, yeah\nShe's my cherry pie\nPut a smile on your face, ten miles wide\nLooks so good, bring a tear to your eye\nSweet cherry pie, yeah, pie\nYou might also like[Bridge]\n(Swing it!)\nAll night long\n(Swing it!)\nLike a trained professional\n\n[Verse 3]\nSwingin' in the bathroom, swingin' on the floor\nSwingin' so hard, forgot to lock the door\nIn walked her daddy standin' 6 foot 4\nHe said, \"You ain't gonna swing with my daughter no more\"\n\n[Chorus]\nShe's my cherry pie\nCool drink of water, such a sweet surprise\nTastes so good, make a grown man cry\nSweet cherry pie, oh, yeah\nShe's my cherry pie\nPut a smile on your face, ten miles wide\nLooks so good, bring a tear to your eye\nSweet cherry pie\nSweet cherry pie, yeah, huh\n\n[Outro]\nSwing it!8Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/901327", "artist_names": "Black Box (Ft.

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWe never talked about it\nBut I hear the blame was mine\nI'd call you up to say I'm sorry\nBut I wouldn't want to waste your time\n\n'Cause I love you, but I can't take any more\nThere's a look I can't describe in your eyes\nIf we could try, like we tried before\nWould you keep on telling me those lies? (Telling me lies)\n[Chorus]\nDo you remember?... (Do you remember?)\nUh, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere seemed no way to make up\n'Cause it seemed your mind was set\nAnd the way you looked it told me\nIt's a look I know I'll never forget\nYou could've come over to my side\nYou could've let me know\nYou could've tried to see the distance between us\nBut it seemed too far for you to go\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you remember?... (Do you remember?)\nUh, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)\n\n[Verse 3]\nThrough all of my life\nIn spite of all the pain\nYou know people are funny sometimes\n'Cause they just can't wait\nTo get hurt again\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me, do you remember?...

wrong\nSometimes it's hard to be that strong\nAnd oh, I would do anything\nFor you I'd turn the stars around\nI'd find a way somehow\n\nThis time, you'll see I built a bridge to you again\nLove shines, we'll sweep away the past\nWe're more than lovers, more than friends\n\nAnd through the good and bad times\nYou have always been there\nWe hold each other tight\nYou tell me it's alright\nThe

same no matter time nor place\nThey don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes\nSo to you other kids all across the land\nThere's no need to argue, parents just don't understand\n\n[Verse 1]\nI remember one year\nMy mom took me school shopping\nIt was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister\nAll hopped in the car\nWe headed downtown to the Gallery Mall\nMy mom started bugging with the clothes she chose\nI didn't say nothing at first\nI just turned up my nose\nShe said, \u201cWhat's wrong? This shirt cost $20\u201d\nI said, \u201cMom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!\u201d\nThe next half hour was the same old thing\nMy mother buying me clothes from 1963\nAnd then she lost her mind and did the ultimate\nI asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!\nI said, \u201cMom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep\u201d\nShe said, \u201cYou're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet\u201d\nI said, \u201cMom, let's put these clothes back, please\u201d\nShe said \u201cNo, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show\u201d\nI said, \u201cThis isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer\nMom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers\nBut if you don't want to I can live with that but\nYou gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks\u201d\nShe wasn't moved - everything stayed the same\nInevitably the first day of school came\nI thought I could get over, I tried to play sick\nBut my mom said, \u201cNo, no way, uh-uh, forget it\u201d\nThere was nothing I could do, I tried to relax\nI got dressed up in those ancient artifacts\nAnd when I walked into school, it was just as I thought\nThe kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought\nAnd those who weren't laughing still had a ball\nBecause they were pointing and whispering\nAs I walked down the hall\nI got home and told my Mom how my day went\nShe said, \u201cIf they were laughing you don't need them\n'Cause they're not good friends\u201d\nFor the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom\nThat I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times\nSo to you all the kids all across the land\nThere's no need to argue\nParents just don't understand\n[Verse 2]\nOh-kay, here's the situation\nMy parents went away on a week's vacation and\nThey left the keys to the brand new Porsche\nWould they mind?\nUmm, well, of course not\nI'll just take it for a little spin\nAnd maybe show it off to a couple of friends\nI'll just cruise it around the neighborhood\nWell, maybe I shouldn't...\nYeah, of course, I should\nPay attention, here's the thick of the plot\nI pulled up to the corner at the end of my block\nThat's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking\nI picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking\nYou should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions\nI honked my horn just to get her attention\nShe said, \u201cWas that for me?\u201d\nI said, \u201cYeah\u201d\nShe said, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nI said, \u201cCome on and take a ride with a helluva guy\u201d\nShe said, \u201cHow do I know you're not sick?\nYou could be some deranged lunatic\u201d\nI said, \u201cC'mon, toots, my name is the Prince\nBesides, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?\u201d\nShe agreed and we were on our way\nShe was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word\nWe hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive\nWe ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes\nShe kicked her shoes off onto the floor\nShe said, \u201cDrive fast, speed turns me on\u201d\nShe put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas\nWe almost got whiplash, I took off so fast\nThe sunroof was open, the music was high\nAnd this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh\nShe had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far\nI guess that's why I didn't notice that police car\nWe're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche\nAnd to make this long story short - short\nWhen the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell\nI said, \u201cI don't have a license but I drive very well, officer\u201d\nI almost had a heart attack that day\nCome to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway\nI was arrested, the car was impounded\nThere was no way for me to avoid being grounded\nMy parents had to come off from vacation to get me\nI'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me\nMy parents walked in\nI got my grip, I said, \u201cAh, Mom, Dad... how was your trip?\u201d\nThey didn't speak - I said, \u201cI want to plead my case\u201d\nBut my father just shoved me in the car by my face\nThat was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived\nThey took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving\nI can't believe it, I just made a mistake\nWell parents are the same no matter time nor place\nSo to you other kids all across the land\nTake it from me, parents just don't understandYou might also like6Embed"}]
