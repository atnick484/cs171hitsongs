goin' on\nI wasn't worried about the other side when that shit was goin' on\nAnd we don't hang with different niggas, don't ask us what we on\nThe only time we'll beat the case, you pull out camera phones\nI used to draw Lil' Mo name on the styrofoam\nI had to teach the grown niggas, right from wrong\nWhy the state had told the jury, \"They tryna indict us all\"\nThe lawyers got them affidavits, they better sign them all, hm\nI had a bad bitch off the 'Gram, she let her titties hang\nShe told Bandz I bought her a Birkin, I told her anything\nI was ridin' 'round with guns in that Bentley thang\nWe puttin' stickers on our drums, that's a city thang\nI hate the niggas who be tryna switch the block up\nI be with the killers who would change a nigga roster\nI'm from the part of the city, watch your partner\nYou ain't did shit to the same nigga who shot ya\n'Fore you leave that door, gotta pick your Glock up\nCan't nut in no more whores, I got that from my momma\nShuttin' down the stores, you do that with these commas\nYou had me at my lowest, I'm ridin' 'round with choppers\n[Chorus]\n(Oh)\nClose that backdoor, can't get snaked out by my homie (No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah)\nClose that backdoor 'cause I know that shit's phony (No, no, no, no, no, whoa)\nClose that backdoor, can't get snaked by my homie (Oh)\nClose that backdoor 'cause I know this love phony\n\n[Verse 2]\nThat's a bet\nI'm The Voice, that mean Dee-Dee, he the threat\nDon't get stretched, 'cause foenem tweakin' off the X\nI know what happened to your homie, don't be next\nHe got that get back for his block, I tilt my hat\nFeel like I'm drownin', got this water 'round my neck\nCocky nigga throwin' ashes on Pateks\nWent to the trenches, threw up the treys on the Met (Yeah)\nThey be callin' me, you hangin' where it's dangerous\nI'm just slidin' to out west, just for Uncle Remus\nAll my sibling's kids know your uncle famous\nI know this shit sound dumb and the strangest\nIn the trenches, I feel the safest\nOn the radio, shoutout Nehpets\nDid it off the love but I gave \u2018em faces\n\n[Chorus]\n(Oh)\nClose that backdoor, can't get snaked by my homie (No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah)\nClose that backdoor 'cause I know that shit's phony (No, no, no, no, no, whoa)\nClose that backdoor, can't get snaked by my homie (Oh)\nClose that backdoor 'cause I know this love

no friend of mine, muhfucker\n\n[Chorus]\nYou muhfuckin' right\nYou muhfuckin' right, I'm bitter\nYou muhfuckin' right, I'm triggered\nYou muhfuckin' right, I...\n[Verse 2]\nWanna fuck you right now\nI just turned the lights out now\nAnd you know when the sun go down\nThat's when it would all go down\nBeen a minute, been a while\nAin't let nobody hit it since you hit it\nI know you always know what to do wit' it\nBut ain't no me and you without you in it\nDamn, I'm 'bout to burn this bitch down\nI think I need to lie down\n'Cause I'm not tryna wild out now\nBut right now\n\n[Verse 3]\nDon't know what I'm capable of\nMight fuck around and go crazy on cuz\nMight fuck around, have to pay me in blood\nThis ain't the way that you want it\nMight catch a case in this bitch\nDon't let me catch you face-to-face in this bitch\nTryin' my hardest not to disrespect you\nAfter what you did, man, what you expected?\nYou muhfucker\n\n[Chorus]\nYou muhfuckin' right\nYou muhfuckin' right,

yeah\nMaybe I'm overreacting\nBaby, I don't know what happened\nYou know all of my bad habits\nYou know it's hard for me to control that shit, man\n'Cause when I get mad, I get big mad\nShould have never did that, get back\n'Bout to feel the wrath of a menace\nIn my bag, in my feelings\nI'm a bad lil' bitch, and uh...\n\n[Outro]\nI'm triggered, when I see your face\nTriggered, when I hear your

head\nDo a little spring cleanin'\nI'm always too busy\u2005dreamin'\nWell,\u2005maybe I should\u2005wake up instead\nA lot of things\u2005I regret, but I just say I forget\nWhy can't it just be easy?\nWhy does everybody need me to stay?\nOh, I hate the feelin'\nWhen you're high, but you're underneath the ceilin'\nGot the cards in my hand, I hate dealin', yeah\nGet everything I need, then I'm gone, but it ain't stealin'\nCan I get a break?\nI wish that I could just get out my goddamn way\nWhat is there to say?\nThere ain't a better time than today\nWell, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah\nInstead of always tryin' to figure everything out\nAnd all I do is say sorry\nHalf the time I don't even know what I'm sayin' it about\n[Chorus]\nGood news, good news, good news\nThat's all they wanna hear\nNo, they don't like it when I'm down\nBut when I'm flyin', oh\nIt make 'em so uncomfortable\nSo different, what's the difference?\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen it ain't that bad\nIt could always be worse\nI'm runnin' out of gas, hardly anything left\nHope I make it home from work\nWell, so tired of bein' so tired\nWhy I gotta build somethin' beautiful just to go set it on fire?\nI'm no liar, but\nSometimes the truth don't sound like the truth\nMaybe 'cause it ain't\nI just love the way it sound when I say it, yeah\nIt's what I do\nIf you know me, it ain't anything new\nWake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while\nBut I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah\nI heard they don't talk about me too much no more\nAnd that's the problem with a closed door\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nGood news, good news, good news\nThat's all they wanna hear\nNo, they don't like it when I'm down\nBut when I'm flyin', oh\nIt make 'em so uncomfortable\nSo different, what's the difference?\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side\nI'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer\nI know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time\nI'll finally discover\nThat there's a whole lot more for me waitin'\nThat there's a whole lot more for me waitin'\nI know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time\nThen I'll finally discover\nThat it ain't that bad, ain't so bad\nWell, it ain't that bad, mm\nAt least it don't gotta be no more\n\n[Outro]\nNo more, no more, no more, no more\nNo more, no more, no more, no more\nHey,

a mink (Mink)\nAnd I got Fiji on me, she mistake my Patek for the sink\nI was in Dallas at V-Live, honeycomb settings in the chain like a beehive\nHe say he want the static with a nigga, seen him in the streets, he ain't tryna be 'bout it, ayy\nThey know the Crippin' is serious, ayy\nBlue faces in my Amiris\nWe got a Sprinter of hoes coming in, I like my bad bitches curious\nI just ordered up a Rolls Royce truck with the Gucci interior (Interior), ayy\nWhen I was bending the block with the lasers out, they thought it was Christmas\nUp the block and knock his braces out, we caught 'em slipping\nWe was working out that vacant house, God, forgive me (Forgive me)\n\n[Chorus: Meek Mill]\nI used to fuck up my re-up\nNow, it's the jet with my feet up\nI got the money and power\nNow none

(Yeah)\nInvite 'em in like a One A Day\nI'm not done (Preach!)\n'Cause I feel like the beast of burden\nThat line in the sand, was it even worth it?\n'Cause the way I see people turning's\nMakin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose\nI'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds\nAnd I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word\nHas the court of public opinion reached a verdict\nOr still yet to be determined?\n'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped\nBut if I could go back, I'd at least reword it\nAnd say I empathize with the people this evil serpent\nSold the dream to that he's deserted\nBut I think it's workin'\nThese verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous\nAnd he's too scurred to answer me with words\n'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered\nBut I know at least he's heard it\n'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service\nTo meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him\nOr ask if I'm linked to terrorists\nI said, \"Only when it comes to ink and lyricists\"\nBut my beef is more media journalists\n(Hold up, hold up, hold up)\nI said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist\nCan get a mouthful of flesh\nAnd yes, I mean eating a penis\n'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death\nSo I've been givin' the media fingers\nDon't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh\nBut they've been puttin' me

favorite song\nDon't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along\nI know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone\nAnd even then the thing that comes after is movin' on\nI can't even capture the feeling I had at first\nMeetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works\nThe people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse\nTheir actions out of character even when they rehearse\nWorkin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave\nI gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place\nBreakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved\nAnd they don't like that, it's written all on they face\nI don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean\nCan't even keep track of who plays for the other team\nIconic duos rip and split at the seams\nGood-hearted people are takin' it to extremes\nLeavin' me in limbo to question what I believe\nLeavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace\nLeavin' me to not trust anybody I meet\nLeavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?\n[Chorus: Mariah Carey]\nYou've got me fe\u2013\nYou, oh\nYou've got me fe\u2013\nYou, oh, ayy\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nMissin' out on my years\nThere's times when I wish I was where I was\nBack when I used to wish I was here\nMissin' out on my days\nScrollin' through life and fishin' for praise\nOpinions from total strangers take me out of my ways\nI try and see who's there on the other end of the shade\nMost times it's just somebody that's underaged\nThat's probably just alone and afraid\nAnd lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain\nI always hear people complain about the place that they live\nThat all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give\n'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit\nThat makes another city seem more excitin' than it is\nI know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome\nThen she finally got to Rome\nAnd all she did was post pictures for people at home\n'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known\nI know another girl that's cryin' out for help\nBut her latest caption is \"Leave me alone\"\nI know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone\nI know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown\nTo post later and make it look like she still on the go\nLook at the way we live\nI wasn't hidin' my kid from the world\nI was hidin' the world from my kid\nFrom empty souls who just wake up and look to debate\nUntil you starin' at your seed, you can never relate\nBreakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs\nThe only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call\nThey always ask, \"Why let the story run if it's false?\"\nYou know a wise man once said nothin' at all\nI'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend\nAll these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch\nAll these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?\nI guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $140You might also like[Outro: Mariah

in your wake, ripple your sweet fate\nAnd more chune for your headtop\nSo watch how you speak on my name, you know?\n\n[Verse 1: Drake]\nYeah, I couldn't get a bill paid\nYou couldn't buy the real thing\nI was stayin\u2019 up at yo' place\nTryin' to figure out the whole thing\nI saw people doin' things\nAlmost gave up on the music thing\nBut we all so spoiled now\nMore life, more everything\nMust have never had your phone tapped\nAll that yappin' on the phone shit\nYou must really love the road life\nAll that never comin' home shit\n[Chorus: Drake]\nFree smoke, free smoke, ayy\nFree smoke, free smoke, ayy\nFree smoke, free smoke, ayy\n\n[Verse 2: Drake]\nDom Ros\u00e9 toast\nHidden Hills where I post\nI start my day slow\nSilk pajamas when I wake though\nMiraval to the face though\nI drunk text J-Lo\nOld number, so it bounce back\nBoi-1da got the bounce back\nUsed to get paid for shows in front-door money\nFive, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that\nMe and Gibbo was about that\nEatin' Applebee's and Outback\nSouthwest, no first class\nHilton rooms, gotta double up\nWritin\u2019 our name on a double cup\nWe ain\u2019t even have a tour bus\nGirls wouldn't even think of recordin\u2019 me\nI fall asleep in sororities\nI had some different priorities\nWeezy had all the authority\nWomen I like was ignorin' me\nNow they like, \"Aren't you
