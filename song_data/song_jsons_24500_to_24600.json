as I'm alive I gets mine, no time to wait it out\nEnergy, no fading out\nThe blessing is we made it out, yeah, we made it out\nNo time to reminisce, don't waste time for a little bit\nYou people talk a lot of shit, so and so for a little bit\nDepression is killin' us, basadi tryna live with it\nCan we get rid of it by makin' money, gettin' rich?\nDo you people even understand what we dealin' with?\nOr do you view my life as a joke, o re filimi?\nOut-pouring the love from everybody that's feelin' me\nWe literally tryna trade no points for epidemies\nEish, bophelo bo tricky ngwana timer\nWalking to our destinies so you ain't gotta time us\nLong walk to freedom so we break out in a Cypher\nRap to the beatbox, banyana ba jaiva\nNo matter how tough it gets, try to live your life right\nBob, weave, stick and move like a Iron Mike fight\nThings takin' long to connect like slow WiFi\nThe metaverse takin' over, re phila se Sci-Fi\nWait, sa ntlela ka stress buddy, woah\nI'll make your city feel the blues like Pep Guardiola\nWe spiritual, re le destroy-a ka de [?]\nMy drip sick, they thirsty, ba tletse ka lenyora\n[Chorus: Pdot O]\nBathi \"Aw'phinde mzala\", aw'phinde

2: Pdot O]\nSpoken like a gentleman, handle and understand it's him\nThey tryna cancel him, hella bent on the sentences\nHeaven sent, writin' this poetry is a special blend\nAll my passion with the spirit in, check\nWe gotta grow, even alone I suppose\nDiamonds are forever and forever we light up the room\nSome will assume this is easy, some assume we defeated\nWe the kings, we believe a higher power, charge the batteries (Brother)\nBrothers is a memory, I pray they at peace\nGot a couple peeps who need a peace of mind for release\nBut at least ('Least)\n(We got-) We got a life, celebrate it\nGrateful I ain't gotta live my life on medication\nIt's a statement, they got my songs on the playlist\nBlack and white attire combination, not racist\nWe pray against, hell fire we the messengers\nIt take a lot to even step to us, yes\nYou might also like[Chorus: Pdot O]\nBathi \"Aw'phinde mzala\", aw'phinde mzala\nMiss a step, wa sala\nNabo sis' ba khala\nAnd futhi don't want no

"url": "https://genius.com/artists/James-joyce"}, "artist": "James Joyce", "lyrics": "Ulysses (Chap. 16 - Eumaeus) LyricsPreparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion, which he very badly needed. His (Stephen's) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom, in view of the hour it was and there being no pumps of Vartry water available for their ablutions, let alone drinking purposes, hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman's shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt Bridge, where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e. d. ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly, after a few such preliminaries, as, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, brushing, they both walked together along Beaver street, or, more properly, lane, as far as the farrier's and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens Street round by the corner of Dan Bergin's. But, as he confidently anticipated, there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star Hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.\n\nThis was a quandary but, bringing commonsense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullet's and the Signal House, which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons, though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance. So, as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company's sandstrewer happening to be returning the elder man recounted to his companion \u00e0 propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour, and, passing the back door of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night), ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station. Between this point and the high, at present unlit, warehouses of Beresford Place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird's, the stonecutter's, in his mind somehow in Talbot Place, first turning on the right, while the other, who was acting as his fidus Achates, inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke's city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread? At Rourke's the baker's, it is said.\n\nEn route, to his taciturn, and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion, Mr Bloom, who at all events, was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while, though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little juijitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn't look out. Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious that, but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour, the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward, or, failing that, the Bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias, or, he being the solicitor, rather old Wall, he meant to say, or Malony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A Division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the City, Pembroke Road, for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description, liable to go off at any time, which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall nut over anything. You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of #. s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and blood-making and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically. Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting confr\u00e8res but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.\n\n\u2014And that one was Judas, said Stephen, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.\n\nDiscussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge when a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox, or something like one, attracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened, or had been mentioned as having happened, before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's Gumley. To avoid a meeting be drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.\n\n\u2014Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.\nA figure of middle height on the prowl, evidently, under the arches saluted again, calling: Night! Stephen, of course, started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment. Mr Bloom, actuated by motives of inherent delicacy, inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business, moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least. Although unusual in the Dublin area, he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be about waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garotted.\n\nStephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in any over sober state himself, recognised Corley's breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley, some called him, and his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of Inspector Corley of the G Division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His grandfather, Patrick Michael Corley, of New Ross, had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had it, though not proved, that she descended from the house of the Lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, his mother or aunt or some relative had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This, therefore, was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.\n\nTaking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. His friends had all deserted him. Furthermore, he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of other uncalled-for expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God's earth he could get something, anything at all to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn't a complete fabrication from start to finish. Anyhow, he was ill in.\n\n\u2014I wouldn't ask you, only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I'm on the rocks.\n\n\u2014There'll be a job tomorrow or the next day, Stephen told him, in a boys' school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garret Deasy. Try it. You may mention my name.\n\n\u2014Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn't teach in a school, man. I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. Got stuck twice in the junior at the Christian Brothers.\n\n\u2014I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.\n\nCorley, at the first go-off, was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney's, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M'Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he hadn't said a word about it.\n\nThough this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley's brandnew rigmarole, on a par with the others, was hardly deserving of much credence. However, haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco, etcetera, as the Latin poet remarks, especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it Out of Corley's head that he was living in affluence and hadn't a thing to do but hand out the needful - whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow, not with the idea of finding any food there, but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat. But the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation. He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost, as well he might have, or left, because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse, in fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect about biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gave them, or where was, or did he buy? However, in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously, however, as it turned out.\n\n\u2014Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.\n\nAnd so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen lent him one of them.\n\n\u2014Thanks, Corley answered. You're a gentleman. I'll pay you back some time. Who's that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan the billsticker. You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there. I'd carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they're full up for the next three weeks, man. God, you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don't give a shite anyway so long as I get a job even as a crossing sweeper.\n\nSubsequently, being not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six he got, he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam's, the shipchandler's bookkeeper there, that used to be often round in Nagle's back with O'Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow, he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.\nMr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman's sentrybox, who, evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen's anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation, he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally, testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Probably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his next door neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude, with or without the option of a fine, would be a very rara avis altogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.\n\nThe pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom, who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:\n\n\u2014He's down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.\n\nAt this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucket dredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse Quay and quite possibly Out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively:\n\n\u2014Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it his face was familiar to me. But leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?\n\n\u2014Half-a-crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.\n\n\u2014Needs, Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does. Everyone according to his needs and everyone according to his deeds. But talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is Out of the question and, even supposing you did, you won't get in after what occurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I don't mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father's house?\n\n\u2014To seek misfortune, was Stephen's answer.\n\n\u2014I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned. Today, in fact, or, to be strictly accurate, on yesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.\n\n\u2014I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why?\n\n\u2014A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one. He takes great pride, quite legitimately, Out of you. You could go back, perhaps, he hazarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying, as if the whole bally station belonged to them, to give Stephen the slip in the confusion.\n\nThere was no response forthcoming to the suggestion, however, such as it was, Stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it, with his sister, Dilly, sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmeal water for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny, with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or, if not, ember days or something like that.\n\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn't personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher, and friend, if I were in your shoes. He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you didn't notice as much as I did but it wouldn't occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.\nHe understood, however, from all he heard, that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it? was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.\n\n\u2014Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.\n\nThe guarded glance of half solicitude, half curiosity, augmented by friendliness, which he gave at Stephen's at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact, on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled, to judge by two or three low spirited remarks he let drop, or, the other way about, saw through the affair, and, for some reason or other best known to himself, allowed matters to more or less... Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.\n\nAdjacent to the men's public urinal he perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.\n\n\u2014Putana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!\n\n\u2014Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano pi\u00f9\n\n\u2014Dice lui, pero.\n\n\u2014Farabutto! Mortacci sui!\n\nMr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman's shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely, if ever, been before; the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it, said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat, Fitzharris, the invincible, though he wouldn't vouch for the actual facts, which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner, only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo, already there engaged in eating and drinking, diversified by conversation, for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.\n\n\u2014Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say a roll of some description.\n\nAccordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly. The hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores, or whatever they were, after a cursory examination, turned their eyes, apparently dissatisfied, away, though one redbearded bibulous individual, a portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor, probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.\n\nMr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over voglio, remarked to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in an audible tone of voice, apropos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious:\n\n\u2014Beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not write your poetry in that language? Bella Poetria! it is so melodious and full. Belladonna voglio.\n\nStephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn, if he could, suffering from dead lassitude generally, replied:\n\n\u2014To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.\n\n\u2014Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.\n\nThe keeper of the shelter in the middle of this t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed, after which he beat a retreat to his counter. Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to... for which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.\n\n\u2014Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time. Like names, Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody, Jesus, Mr Doyle. Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What's in a name?\n\n\u2014Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.\n\nThe redbearded sailor, who had his weather eye on the newcomers, boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking:\n\n\u2014And what might your name be?\n\nJust in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion's boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure, from an unexpected quarter, answered:\n\n\u2014Dedalus.\n\nThe sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.\n\n\u2014You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.\n\n\u2014I've heard of him, Stephen said.\n\nMr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.\n\n\u2014He's Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding. All Irish.\n\n\u2014All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.\n\nAs for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor, of his own accord, turned to the other Occupants of the shelter with the remark: I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder. The left hand dead shot.\n\nThough he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.\n\n\u2014Bottle Out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.\n\nHe turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely, then he screwed his features up some way sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.\n\n\u2014Pom, he then shouted once.\n\nThe entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.\n\n\u2014Pom, he shouted twice.\n\nEgg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily:\n\nBuffalo Bill shoots to kill,\nNever missed nor he never will.\n\nA silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.\n\n\u2014Beg pardon, the sailor said.\n\n\u2014Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He toured the wide world with Hengler's Royal Circus. I seen him do that in Stockholm.\n\n\u2014Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.\n\n\u2014Murphy's my name, the sailor continued, W. B. Murphy, of Carrigaloe. Know where that is?\n\n\u2014Queenstown Harbour, Stephen replied.\n\n\u2014That's right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That's where I hails from. My little woman's down there. She's waiting for me, I know. For England, home and beauty. She's my own true wife I haven't seen for seven years now, sailing about.\n\nMr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene - the homecoming to the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones - a rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O'Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece, by the way, of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way? Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but I've come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grass widow, at the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead. Rocked in the cradle of the deep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. No chair for father. Boo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, post mortem child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband, W. B. Murphy.\n\nThe sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:\n\n\u2014You don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you, do you?\n\nThe jarvey addressed, as it happened, had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.\n\n\u2014Thank you, the sailor said.\n\nHe deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing, and with some slow stammers, proceeded:\n\n\u2014We come up this morning eleven o'clock. The threemaster Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this afternoon. There's my discharge. See? W. B. Murphy, A. B. S.\n\nIn confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbours a not very clean looking folded document.\n\n\u2014You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor answered, upon reflection upon it, I've circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and North America and South America. I seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles, under Captain Dalton the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. Gospodi pomilooy. That's how the Russians prays.\n\n\u2014You seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug, I seen queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.\n\nHe took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously.\n\n\u2014Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.\n\nHe fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket, which seemed to be in its way a species of repository, and pushed it along the table. The printed matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.\n\nAll focused their attention on the scene exhibited, at a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping, amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.\n\n\u2014Chews coca all day long, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like breadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can't bear no more children. See them there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse's liver raw.\n\nHis postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes, if not more.\n\n\u2014Know how to keep them off? he inquired genially.\n\nNobody volunteering a statement, he winked, saying:\n\n\u2014Glass. That boggles 'em. Glass.\n\nMr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as follows: Tarjeta Postal. Se\u00f1or A. Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile. There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice. Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in Maritana on which occasion the former's ball passed through the latter's hat), having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend's bona fides, nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd's heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside, considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six there and back. The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on, culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower, abbey, wealth of Park Lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C. P. M'Coy type - lend me your valise and I'll post you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star Irish cast, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with its own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure. But who? That was the rub.\n\nAlso, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the tapis in the Circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.\n\nIt was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for a matter of a couple of paltry pounds, was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in the summertime, for choice, when Dame Nature is at her spectacular best, constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs, even, Poulaphouca, to which there was a steam tram, but also farther away from the madding crowd, in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen, so long as it didn't come down, and in the wilds of Donegal, where if report spoke true, the coup d'oeil was exceedingly grand, though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it, while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O'Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men, especially in the spring when young men s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour's run from the pillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired. Interesting to fathom, it seemed to him, from a motive of curiosity pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or vice-versa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to Stephen.\n\n\u2014I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened, and every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the Chinese does.\n\nPossibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces, the globetrotter went on adhering to his adventures.\n\n\u2014And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his back. Knife like that.\n\nWhilst speaking he produced a dangerous looking clasp knife, quite in keeping with his character, and held it in the striking position.\n\n\u2014In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. Prepare to meet your God, says he. Chuck! It went into his back up to the butt.\n\nHis heavy glance, drowsily roaming about, kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to. That's a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable stiletto.\n\nAfter which harrowing d\u00e9nouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.\n\n\u2014They're great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.\n\nAt this remark, passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss, Mr Bloom and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, alias the keeper, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. His inscrutable face, which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn't understand one jot of what was going on. Funny very.\n\nThere ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading by fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal; another, the card with the natives choza de; another, the seaman's discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, some score of years previously, in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.\n\n\u2014Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.\n\nThe request being complied with, he clawed them up with a scrape.\n\n\u2014Have you seen the Rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.\n\nThe sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay, or no.\n\n\u2014Ah, you've touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spurt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.\n\n\u2014What year would that be about? Mr Bloom interpolated. Can you recall the boats?\n\nOur soi-disant sailor munched heavily awhile, hungrily, before answering.\n\n\u2014I'm tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships. Salt junk all the time.\n\nTired, seemingly, he ceased. His questioner, perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe. Suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant, to rule the waves. On more than one occasion - a dozen at the lowest - near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under - well, not exactly under, tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going into the minutiae of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance, which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason, if no other, lifeboat Sunday was a very laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living, inland or seaside,-is the case might be, having it brought home to them like that, should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements, whatever the season, when duty called Ireland expects that every man and so on, and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.\n\n\u2014There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded. Went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman's valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I've on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. I'm game for that job, shaving and brushup. I hate roaming about. There's my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper's in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.\n\n\u2014What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed, of course, and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance. My son Danny? He'd be about eighteen now, way I figure it.\n\nThe Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink, intended to represent an anchor.\n\n\u2014There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked. Sure as nuts. I must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It's them black lads I objects to. I hate those buggers. Sucks your blood dry, they does.\n\nSeeing they were all looking at his chest, he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that, on top of the time honoured symbol of the mariner's hope and rest, they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man's sideface looking frowningly rather.\n\n\u2014Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton Fellow the name of Antonio done that. There he is himself, a Greek.\n\n\u2014Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.\n\nThat worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the someway in his. Squeezing or...\n\n\u2014See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is, cursing the mate. And there he is now, he added. The same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.\n\nAnd in point of fact the young man named Antonio's livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody, including Skin-the-Goat who this time stretched over.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He's gone too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.\n\nHe let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.\n\n\u2014Neat bit of work, longshoreman one said.\n\n\u2014And what's the number for? loafer number two queried.\n\n\u2014Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time, with some sort of a half smile, for a brief duration only, in the direction of the questioner about the number. A Greek he was.\n\nAnd then he added, with rather gallowsbird humour, considering his alleged end:\n\n\u2014As bad as old Antonio,\nFor he left me on my ownio.\n\nThe face of a streetwalker, glazed and haggard under a black straw hat, peered askew round the door of the shelter, palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment, flusterfied but outwardly calm, and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink? His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond Quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane, who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.), and begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing, which seemed rather vague than not?\n\nYour washing. Still, candour compelled him to admit that he had washed his wife's undergarments when soiled in Holles Street and women would and did too a man's similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper's marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say. Love me, love my dirty shirt. Still, just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female's room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round Skipper Murphy's nautical chest and then there was no more of her.\n\n\u2014The gunboat, the keeper said.\n\n\u2014It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock Hospital, reeking with disease, can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of course, I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. Still no matter what the cause is from...\n\nStephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:\n\n\u2014In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.\n\nThe elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said that it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing he could truthfully state he, as a paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of that sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.\n\n\u2014 You, as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup? I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?\n\nThus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say:\n\n\u2014They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause, Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette.\n\nMr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:\n\n\u2014Simple? I shouldn't think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays R\u00f6ntgen did, Or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time, Galileo was the man I mean. The same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it's a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.\n\n\u2014O, that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the best known passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence. On this knotty point, however, the views of the pair, poles apart as they were, both in schooling and everything else, with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.\n\n\u2014Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point. I'm not so sure about that. That's a matter of every man's opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you in toto there. My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it's the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them, like Hamlet and Bacon, as you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn't tell you. Can't you drink that coffee, by the way? Let me stir it and take a piece of that bun. It's like one of our skipper's bricks disguised. Still, no one can give what he hasn't got. Try a bit.\n\n\u2014Couldn't, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.\n\nFaultfinding being a proverbially bad hat, Mr Bloom thought well to stir, or try to, the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good. Shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings, and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders. On the other hand, he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of. Sulphate of copper poison, SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn't remember when it was or where. Anyhow, inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables, seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble's Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.\n\n\u2014Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.\n\nThus prevailed on to at any rate taste it, Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle - it clopped out of it when taken up - by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.\n\n\u2014Still, it's solid food, his good genius urged, I'm a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work, mental or manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man.\n\n\u2014Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But oblige me by taking away that knife. I can't look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.\n\nMr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.\n\n\u2014Our mutual friend's stories are like himself, Mr Bloom, apropos of knives, remarked to his confidente sotto voce. Do you think they are genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots. Look at him.\n\nYet still, though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air, life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.\n\nHe had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up, ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. He might even have done for his man, supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen Of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness, because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad, would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner Hesperus and etcetera. And when all was said and done, the lies a fellow told about himself couldn't probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.\n\nMind you, I'm not saying that it's all a pure invention, he resumed. Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants, though, that is rather a far cry you see once in a way. Marcella, the midget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged. They couldn't straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline, the sinews, or whatever you like to call them, behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods. There's an example again of simple souls.\n\nHowever, reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, alias Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the Flying Dutchman, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains), there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary, that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those Italianos, though candidly he was none the less free to admit those ice creamers and friers in the fish way, not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth, over in little Italy there, near the Coombe, were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuck in with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.\n\n\u2014Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus double quick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally. My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half, that is. Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite dark, regular brunette, black. I, for one, certainly believe climate accounts for character. That's why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.\n\n\u2014The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings. Roberto ruba roba sua.\n\n\u2014Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.\n\n\u2014Then, Stephen said, staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle, Miss Portinari, he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.\n\n\u2014It's in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the blood of the sun. Coincidence, I just happened to be in the Kildare street Museum today, shortly prior to our meeting, if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions of hips, bosom. You simply don't knock against those kind of women here. An exception here and there. Handsome, yes, pretty in a way you find, but what I'm talking about is the female form. Besides, they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman's natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled stockings - it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine, but still it's a thing I simply hate to see.\n\nInterest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy, of course, had his own say to say. He had doubled the Cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him, or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.\n\nSo then after that they drifted on to the wreck of Daunt's rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque - nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it, Palme, on Booterstown Strand, that was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times) breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror. Then someone said something about the case of the s. s. Lady Cairns of Swansea, run into by the Mona, which was on an Opposite tack, in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. No aid was given. Her master, the Mona's, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. She had no water, it appears, in her hold.\n\nAt this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef, the sailor vacated his seat.\n\n\u2014Let me cross your bows, mate, he said to his neighbour, who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful dose.\n\nHe made tracks heavily, slowly, with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings, Mr Bloom, who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship's rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it, or unscrew, and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female, who, however, had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could, by straining, just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gazing up at the piers and girders of the Loop Line, rather out of his depth, as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but, after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme, the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself close at hand, the noise of his bilge-water some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently woke a horse of the cabrank.\n\nA hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brasier of live coke, the watcher of the corporation, who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability, from dictates of humanity, knowing him before - shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in the arms of Morpheus. A truly amazing piece of hard times in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool #100 a year at one time which of course the double-barrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink, without a beggarly stiver. He drank, needless to be told, and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if - a big if, however - he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.\n\nAll, meantime, were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra Basin, the only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.\n\nThere were wrecks and wrecks, the keeper said, who was evidently au fait.\n\nWhat he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway Bay when the Galway Harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh? Ask her captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British Government gave him for that day's work. Captain John Lever of the Lever line.\n\n\u2014Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.\n\nThat worthy, picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words, growled in wouldbe music, but with great vim, some Kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom's sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation-cum-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soir\u00e9e, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:\n\n\u2014The biscuits was as hard as brass,\nAnd the beef as salt as Lot's wife's arse.\nO Johnny Lever!\nJohnny Lever, O!\n\nAfter which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and, regaining his seat, he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided.\n\nSkin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland, or something of that sort, which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God's earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds' worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs, and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always, and gobbling up the best meat in the market, and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was Colonel Everard down there in Cavan growing tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice - thoroughly monopolising all the conversation - was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history. The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero - a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.\n\nSilence all round marked the termination of his finale. The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed.\n\n\u2014Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.\n\nTo which cold douche, referring to downfall and so on, the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.\n\n\u2014Who's the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals and generals we've got? Tell me that.\n\n\u2014The Irish for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.\n\n\u2014That's right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic peasant. He's the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?\n\nWhile allowing him his individual opinions, as every man, the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few irascible words, when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn't indulge in recriminations and come to blows.\n\nFrom inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went On, that turned Out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries, even though poles apart. Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place, rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged, as the lookeron, a student of the human soul, if anything, the others seeing least of the game. And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn't the other person at all, he (Bloom) couldn't help feeling, and most properly, it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen's evidence - or king's now - like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from that, he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel, and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was), a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing, off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south - have her or swing for her - when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (the man having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on\n\nhis adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on. In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome. He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. Like actresses, always farewell - positively last performance then come up smiling again. Generous to a fault, of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow. So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some #. s. d. in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the Old Ireland tavern, come back to Erin and so on. Then as for the others, he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo, as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.\n\nHe took umbrage at something or other, that much injured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew, and in a heated fashion, offensively. So I, without deviating from plain facts in the least, told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too, and all his family, like me, though in reality I'm not. That was one for him. A soft answer turns away wrath. He hadn't a word to say for himself as everyone saw. Am I not right?\n\nHe turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment, with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn't all exactly.\n\n\u2014Ex quibus, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, Christus or Bloom his name is, or, after all, any other, secundum carnem.\n\n\u2014Of course, Mr Bloom proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It's all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality? I resent violence or intolerance in any shape or form. It never reaches anything or stops anything. A revolution must come on the due instalments plan. It's a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, so to speak.\n\n\u2014Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes' war, Stephen assented, between Skinner's alley and Ormond market.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was overwhelmingly right and the whole world was overwhelmingly full of that sort of thing.\n\n\u2014You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn't remotely.\n\nAll those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood - bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag - were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.\n\n\u2014They accuse - remarked he audibly. He turned away from the others, who probably... and spoke nearer to, so as the others... in case they...\n\n\u2014Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen's ear, are accused of ruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History - would you be surprised to learn? - proves up to' the hilt Spain decayed when the Inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian, who, in other respects, has much to answer for, imported them. Why? Because they are practical and are proved to be so. I don't want to indulge in any... because you know the standard works on the subject, and then, orthodox as you are... But in the economic, not touching religion, domain, the priest spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America. Turks, it's in the dogma. Because if they didn't believe they'd go straight to heaven when they die they'd try to live better - at least, so I think. That's the juggle on which the p.p.'s raise the wind on false pretences. I'm, he resumed, with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes pro rata having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of #300 per annum That's the vital issue at stake and it's feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man. At least that's my idea for what it's worth. I call that patriotism. Ubi patria, as we learned a small smattering of in our classical day in Alma Mater, vita bene. Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.\n\nOver his untasteable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular. He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning, burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn't say the words the voice he heard said - if you work.\n\n\u2014Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning to work.\n\nThe eyes were surprised at this observation, because as he, the person who owned them pro. tem. observed, or rather, his voice speaking did: All must work, have to, together.\n\n\u2014I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense. Also literary labour, not merely for the kudos of the thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays. That's work too. Important work. After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education, you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has. What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. Each is equally important.\n\n\u2014You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the faubourg Saint Patrice called Ireland for short.\n\n\u2014I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.\n\n\u2014But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.\n\n\u2014What belongs? queried Mr Bloom, bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately I didn't catch the latter portion. What was it you?...\n\nStephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee, Or whatever you like to call it, none too politely, adding:\n\n\u2014We can't change the country. Let us change the subject.\n\nAt this pertinent suggestion, Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down, but in a quandary, as he couldn't tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say, the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way, foreign to his sober state. Probably the home life, to which Mr Bloom attached the utmost importance, had not been all that was needful or he hadn't been familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of fear for the young man beside him, whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly, nipped in the bud of premature decay, and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance, there was the case of O'Callaghan, for one, the half crazy faddist, respectably connected, though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries, among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual d\u00e9nouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, certain names of those subpoenaed being handed in but not divulged, for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen, which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts, even In the House of Lords, because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy as the law stands was terribly down on, though not for the reason they thought they were probably, whatever it was, except women chiefly, who were always fiddling more or less at one another, it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it. Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every well tailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine fillip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental. However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer force of natural genius, that. With brains, sir.\n\nFor which and further reasons he felt it was interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlooked for occasion, though why, he could not exactly tell, being, as it was, already several shillings to the bad, having, in fact, let himself in for it. Still, to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small... Intellectual stimulation as such was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind. Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt, of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in, especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz., coalminers, divers, scavengers, etc., were very much under the microscope lately. To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing. Suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column, My Experiences, let us say, in a Cabman's Shelter.\n\nThe pink edition, extra sporting, of the Telegraph, tell a graphic lie, lay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just puzzling again, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and the preceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard was addressed to A. Boudin, find the captain's age, his eyes went aimlessly over the respective captions which came under his special province, the allembracing give us this day our daily press.

Ascot Throwaway recalls Derby of '92 when Captain Marshall's dark horse, Sir Hugo , captured the blue riband at long odds. New York disaster, thousand lives lost. Foot and Mouth. Funeral of the late Mr Patrick Dignam.\n\nSo to change the subject he read about Dignam, R.I.P., which, he reflected, was anything but a gay sendoff.\n\n\u2014This morning (Hynes put it in, of course), the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue, Sandymount, for internment in Clasnevin. The deceased gentleman was a most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise, after a brief illness, came as great shock to citizens of all classes by whom he is deeply regretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the deceased were present, were carried out (certainly Hynes wrote it with a nudge from Corny) by Messrs. H. J. O'Neill & Son, 164 North Strand road. The mourners included: Patk. Dignam (son), Bernard Corrigan (motherinlaw), John Henry Menton, solr., Martin Cunningham, John Power eatondph 1/8 ador dorador douradora (must be where he called Monks the dayfather about Keyes's ad), Thomas Kernan, Simon Dedalus, Stephen Dedalus, B. A., Edward J. Lambert, Cornelius Kelleher, Joseph M'C. Hynes, L. Boom, C. P. M'Coy, - M'Intosh, and several others.\n\nNettled not a little by L. Boom (as it incorrectly stated) and the line of bitched type, but tickled to death simultaneously by C. P. M'Coy and Stephen Dedalus, B. A., who were conspicuous, needless to say, by their total absence (to say nothing of M'Intosh), L. Boom pointed it out to his companion B. A., engaged in stifling another yawn, half nervousness, not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of misprints.\n\n\u2014Is that first epistle to the Hebrews, he asked, as soon as his bottom jaw would let him, in? Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it.\n\n\u2014It is, really, Mr Bloom said (though first he fancied he alluded to the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there could be no possible connection) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and a bit flabbergasted at Myles Crawford's after all managing the thing, there.\n\nWhile the other was reading it on page two Boom (to give him for the nonce his new misnomer) whiled away a few odd leisure moments in fits and starts with the account of the third event at Ascot on page three, his sidevalue 1,000 sovs., with 3,000 sovs. In specie added for entire colts and fillies, Mr F.

Though that halfbaked Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get left. Of course, gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though, as the event turned out, the poor fool hadn't much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Guesswork it reduced itself to eventually.\n\n\u2014There was every indication they would arrive at that, Mr Bloom said.\n\n\u2014Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.\n\nOne morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read, Return of Parnell. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was in that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it was killed him. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after Committee Room No. 15 until he was his old self again with no-one to point a finger at him. Then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses. Dead he wasn't. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they brought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.\n\nAll the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels, and not singly but in their thousands, and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years. Highly unlikely, of course, there was even a shadow of truth in the stories and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in his death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before, there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the Alice, where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart, so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility. Naturally then, it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men, which undoubtedly he was, and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So-and-So who, though they weren't even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay. And then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You had to come back - that haunting sense kind of drew you - to show the understudy in the title r\u00f4le how to. He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the Insuppressible or was it United Ireland, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said Thank you, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid expression notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip - what's bred in the bone. Still, as regards return, you were a lucky dog if they didn't set the terrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed. Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials, like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne. Bella was the boat's name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in, as the evidence went to show, and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, Lord Bellew, was it? As he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with, Excuse me, my name is So-and-So or some such commonplace remark. A more prudent course, Mr Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.\n\n\u2014That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented. She put the first nail in his coffin.\n\n\u2014Fine lump of a woman, all the same, the soi-disant town-clerk, Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. I seen her picture in a barber's. Her husband was a captain or an officer.\n\n\u2014Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added. He was, and a cottonball one.\n\nThis gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage. As regards Bloom, he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them, full of sweet nothings. First, it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them, till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however, who were resolved upon encouraging his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. Sino their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact namely, that he had shared her bedroom, which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact that the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties. The usual sequel, to bask in the loved one's smiles. The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk? Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly, augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military supernumerary, that is (who was just the usual everyday farewell, my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate), and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame, which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head, much in the same way as the fabled ass's kick. Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement, all seemed a kind of dream. And the coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown Strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years, looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. North or south however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying, as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn't do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.\n\n\u2014Just bears out what I was saying, he with glowing bosom said to Stephen. And, if I don't greatly mistake, she was Spanish too.\n\n\u2014The king of Spain's daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.\n\n\u2014Was she? Bloom ejaculated surprised, though not astonished by any means. I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there it was, as she lived there. So, Spain.\n\nCarefully avoiding a book in his pocket Sweets of, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents rapidly, finally he.\n\n\u2014Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a fades photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?\n\nStephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady, with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion, as she was in the full bloom of womanhood, In evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted, and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano, on the rest of which was In old Madrid, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her (the lady's) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin's premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.\n\nMrs Bloom, my wife the prima donna, Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated. Taken a few years since. In or about '96. Very like her then.\n\nBeside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen. As for the face, it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure, which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the... He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon, he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry. All the rest, yes, Puritanism. It does though, St Joseph's sovereign... whereas no photo could, because it simply wasn't art, in a word.\n\nThe spirit moving him, he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar's good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he... so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional etiquette so, though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm... And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion. Nevertheless, he sat tight, just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear, however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other's possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint. In fact, the slight soiling was only an added charm, like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better, in fact, with the starch out. Suppose she was gone when he?... I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (sic) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.\n\nThe vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, distingu\u00e9, and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch, though you wouldn't think he had it in him... yet you would. Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was, though at the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of make-believe went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of letterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business. How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions, leaving no loophole, to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate. Then the decree nisi and the King's Proctor to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, nisi was made absolute. But as for that, the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor, who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course. He, Bloom, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred in the historic fracas when the fallen leader's - who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery - (leader's) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the Insuppressible or no it was United Ireland (a by no means, by the by, appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O'Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation, reflecting on the erstwhile tribune's private morals. Though palpably a radically altered man, he was still a commanding figure, though carelessly garbed as usual, with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay, after placing him upon a pedestal, which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character. His hat (Parnell's) was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who, panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time, being a gentleman born with a stake in the country, he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what's bred in the bone, instilled into him in infancy at his mother's knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb, saying: Thank you, sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference; after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.\n\nOn the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabmen and so on, who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another's arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones, with tears in her eyes, though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time, as quite possibly there were several others. He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed, and didn't make the smallest bones about saying so either, that man, or men in the plural, were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life, and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.\n\nIt was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains, as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women, who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies' society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi- or tri-weekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentpaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers' ways and flowers and chocs. To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other's senior or like his father. But something substantial he certainly ought to eat, were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.\n\n\u2014At what o'clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.\n\n\u2014Some time yesterday, Stephen said.\n\n\u2014Yesterday, exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow, Friday. Ah, you mean it's after twelve!\n\n\u2014The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.\n\nLiterally astounded at this piece of intelligence, Bloom reflected. Though they didn't see eye to eye in everything, a certain analogy there somehow was, as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance, when the evicted tenants' question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people's minds though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn't exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle, at all events, was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession, as voicing the trend of modern Opinion, a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of, and even was twitted with going a step further than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan's so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.\n\nAnyhow, upon weighing the pros and cons, getting on for one as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw, not that the cases were either identical or the reverse, though he had hurt his hand too, to Ontario Terrace, as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives... Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered. His initial impression was that he was a bit standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn't what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn't know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps's cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow. At least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet. He failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question, who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn't appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger's bawdyhouse of retired beauties off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character's whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids') with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody's bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let XX equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks passim. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his God being a jew. People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles, your God was a jew, because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhere about in the county Sligo.\n\n\u2014I propose, our hero eventually suggested, after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it's rather stuffy here, you just come with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the vicinity. You can't drink that stuff. Wait, I'll just pay this lot.\n\nThe best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty, who didn't seem to...\n\n\u2014Yes, that's the best, he assured Stephen, to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.\n\nAll kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (Bloom's) busy brain. Education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to date billing, hydros and concert tours in English watering resorts packed with theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a slice of luck. An opening was all was wanted. Because he more than suspected he had his father's voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.\n\nThe cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers' association dinner in London somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement. Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that Sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary's lodge or words to that effect. To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why. - Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.\n\n\u2014And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.\n\nThe sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.\n\n\u2014Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the town clerk queried.\n\n\u2014Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of sea-green portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading. Sand in the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking. The Arabian Nights' Entertainment was my favourite and Red as a Rose is She.\n\nThereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him, as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.\n\nTo cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise to his feet so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans) he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite to him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d., confectionery do., and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark. - Come, he counselled, to close the s\u00e9ance.\n\nSeeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear, they left the shelter or shanty together and the \u00e9lite society of oil skin and company whom nothing short Of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment... the door to...\n\n\u2014One thing I never understood, he said, to be original on the spur of the moment, why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down on the tables In cafes.\n\nTo which impromptu the never failing Bloom replied without a moment's hesitation, saying straight off:\n\n\u2014To sweep the floor in the morning.\n\nSo saying he skipped around nimbly, considering frankly, at the same time apologetic, to get on his companion's right, a habit of his, by the by, the right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.\n\n\u2014It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment. The only thing is to walk then you'll feel a different man. It's not far. Lean on me.\n\nAccordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen's right and led him on accordingly.\n\n\u2014Yes, Stephen said uncertainly, because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.\n\nAnyhow, they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier, etc. where the municipal supernumerary, ex-Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new. And apropos of coffin of stones, the analogy was not at all bad, as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.\n\nSo they passed on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm-in-arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante's Huguenots, Meyerbeer's Seven Last Words on the Cross, and Mozart's Twelfth Mass, he simply revelled in, the Gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be. He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini's Stabat Mater, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers' church in Upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or virtuosi rather. There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and, suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character, there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole, though favouring preferably light opera of the Don Giovanni description, and Martha, a gem in its line, he had a penchant, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned par excellence Lionel's air in Martha, M'appari, which, curiously enough, he heard, or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen's respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn't but launched out into praises of Shakespeare's songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter Lane near Gerard the herbalist, who anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom Bloom did not quite recall, though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and Byrd (William), who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen's Chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.\n\nOn the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swing chain, a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught a right the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.\n\nBy the chains, the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the other's sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:\n\n\u2014Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.\n\nThey thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near, so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh, because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger, putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such a good poor brute, he was sorry he hadn't a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big foolish nervous noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan's, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face. But it was no animal's fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees; whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator, tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke; chalk a circle for a rooster; tiger, my eagle eye. These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind, somewhat distracted from Stephen's words, while the ship of the street was manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old...\n\n\u2014What's this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging in medias res, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.\n\nHe looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual blackguard type they unquestionably had an indubitable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.\n\nStill, supposing he had his father's gift, as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind, such as Lady Fingall's Irish industries concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.\n\nExquisite variations he was now describing on an air Youth here has End by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from. Even more he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit:\n\nVon der Sirenen Listigkeit\nTun die Poeten dichten.\n\nThese opening bars he sang and translated extempore. Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means, which he did.\n\nA phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entr\u00e9e into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B. A. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in- society's sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you. It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record - in fact, without giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin's musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their genus omne. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city's esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big if however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped-up a too much feted prince of good fellows. And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all.\n\nThe horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom's humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person's character, no pun intended.\n\nThe horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted\nand, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.\n\nSide by side Bloom, profiting by the contretemps, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.\n\nUnd alle Schiffe br\u00fccken.\n\nThe driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely\nwatched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, to be married by Father Maher. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their t\u00e9te \u00e0 t\u00e9te (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens enemies of man's reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn't possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street and looked after their lowbacked car.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

Kathy Bates\u205fand also Betty White\nAll the people, if you're the type\nI wanna say that you're equal on the mic\nBut nobody's equal to me\nNobody is coming for my neck\nI am looking for respect\nI'm not looking for a check\nUnless it is for my friends\nThat's why we're doing this\nTo make some pennies\nAnd maybe make amends\nSailors in the sea might get the bends\nThat is my fuckin' dream\nTo go with James Cameron in a submarine\nTo the bottom of the ocean\nRocking forth with the motion\nMe and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion\nSharing our emotion\nDaring you to fuck with us\nAt the sea, at a deep water vent\nBut we don't got the bends, we're not bent\nI think that's what I'm meant to do\nMe and my crew\nGigantic, looking to cross the sea\nFor the Titanic\nOh shit, you mean they found it?\nAlready? They'd abounded with treasure?\nMan, that doesn't give me pleasure\nI don't know how to measure\nHow I feel about that shit\nBut that won't make me quit\nIn my quest, to scour the deep sea\nLike, you and me?\nSearching for an angle, mangled\nThe corpse in the Bermuda Triangle\nMaybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane\nWe're like \"oh, shit, what remains\"\nAnd\nThen we get to the bottom\nAmelia Earhart's like \"oh, shit, got em!\"\nYou didn't know, but I was an immortal\nI just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal\nShuffled off my fucking mortal coil\nMortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil\nAll my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal\nAnd you know, I am not gonna take a foil\nTo my head in a little tin cap shape\nBecause you know I'm great\nI popped the grape\nBut I'm not on some conspiracies\nI'm just trying to see what's up in the seas\nI believe that I will not cease and desist\nYou cannot resist\nWhen I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist\nI am in Manila, in Hong Kong\nIn San Francisco, doing a disco\nPop it hot like it's Crisco\nBut I gotta pace myself\nIf we're gonna raise this wealth\nThat's why I flow at this tempo\nHello, I do kempo\nIn my mind, that's a form of martial arts\nBut I take, partial starts\nAnd I just gave little partial farts\nWhen I'm shitting on the mic\n'Cause you know I got this heart\nAnd you know I got the K-Mart\nState-of-the-art mind\nBut I'm not be-hind\nNo, I'm way out in the front\nRolling up a 30-foot blunt\nAnd you know I'm not gonna bunt\nIn a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger\nBecause I am the rap ringer\nI never make the wrong call\nAnd you know, chicks dig the long ball!\nI am like (Ah)\nThey are like (Wow)\nWatsky, you cannot stop me\nI got no paparazzi\nI'm a fucking doorstep\nI'm gonna take one more step\nAnd then, take another\nWord, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'\nHere I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada\nJust keep rappin', yada yada yada\nHey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld\nMe and him, it's

the Christians\nShoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions\nYou know you cannot stop it\nAlso, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith\nWho know we're gonna make way\nFor the Jehovah's Witnesses\nThey got their hit list-esses\nWalking up to the different fuckin' doors\nSaying \"Would you like to love God a little more?\"\nBut it kinda sucks, just because of COVID\nThey can't be making no bids\nI heard they're not doing that door-knockin'\nBut, you know, we're not stoppin'\nHowever you appraise 'em\nNo, we are fuckin' raising\nOn the mic I'm fuckin' blazing\nIf the sun is blazing\nI turn into a raisin\nI'm bringing this whole craze\nFor almost two whole days\nI don't think that's possible\nI don't think that's wise\nI don't think that's probable\nThat is what they say when they look in to my eyes\nMy momma was afraid for me\nShe busted in like the ma\u00eetre d\nShe said \"Hello umm\"\nI don't think you wanna sit here\nI don't think you wanna get here\n'Cause you might die\nYou know but then I was like \"I gotta try\"\nI gotta try to do the right thing\nShoutout to Spike Lee\nI'm gonna try to get the ring\nTry to get the bling\nTry to be the king of the long raps\nLike I was the dude with the ass raps\nDoesn't matter\nAs long as the people fuckin' clap\nAs long as we give a little joy\nGive em dat'\nThen I will cut the crap\nI guess I am a believer\nAnd I

I'm gonna raise a child\nBut it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild\nThey would make be fuckin' smile\nThey got fuckin' bile and some guts\nEverybody does\nEverybody got guts\nEverybody got nuts\nOr half the people maybe like 48.7%\nThat's about how it went\nI think that is the percentage-ish\nOf the gender fuckin' separation\nAlthough we know in this nation\nThings are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient\nIf you don't understand\nI got my fuckin' rhymes on demand\nI can run it back\nBut I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness\nIf I'm trying to fuckin' win this\nI will not get winded, I have not rescinded\nAnything that I've fucking said\nBy the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead\nI'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds\nThat is like Right Said Fred\nYou just gotta relax\nIf you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe\nI don't get lyrical cataracts\nSo I can see clearly, so I can be dearly\nReceived, I've got to achieve\nWhatever I've got up my sleeve\nWhatever I've got in my pouch\nShoutout to pouch, ouch\nI pricked my finger, that is not true\nBut on this mic I will linger for you\nAnd for my crew\nThis is what I've got to do\nI've got to

crazy Santa\nOh my \u2018lanta\nI can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s tryna get me\nInstead of giving me presents\nI can't believe that he got me on the ground\nBut I'm like \"no I'm Watsky\"\nAnd Santa said \"oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude\"\nBut I'm like \"that's rude\nSanta you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'\nPlus I was in the nude\nHe got me tackled on the

1]\nWell they call her Avenging Annie\nThe avenger of womanhood\nShe spends her whole life telling lies\nLeads him on a mess and over good\n\nShe'll take all these spoiled young hippies\nRunning around playing games\nThey're surrounding your bed, she'll blow your head\nShe'll put you through a change\nWhat you've done to others\nShe'll do unto you\n\n[Verse 2]\nThen she met her sensitive outlaw\nHe was the best thing she'd ever seen\nShe was to be his wife for the rest of her life\nBut she was so blind she could never had seen\nNo!\nSo she joined up with her outlaw\nAnd headed for California\n\n[Verse 3]\nHe treated her worse than she'd ever imagined\nHe didn't say he didn't want her around\nHe kept it up so long, she couldn't be strong\nHe run her right into the ground\nAfter five long years\nHe picked her up and slapped her down\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nThen she told her friends about him\nThey all were on her side\nBut she could see through the haze he looked so pale\nShe put her head right down and she cried\nFor her poor lover\nShe cried like a mother for her poor lover\n\n[Verse 5]\nAnd now she lives on the mountain top\nAnd she's almost thirty-five\nAnd she's found her peace and found her release\nHappy just to be alive\n\nAnd she might go back to her Floyd\nIf she thinks it's the thing to do\nHe gave up murder and theft right after she left\nAnd you know she still loves him too\n\n[Outro]\nJust like your woman loves you\nJust like your woman loves you\nJust like your woman loves you\nJust like your woman loves you\nJust like your woman loves

the deep blue sea\n\nAnd there we'll do just as we please\nIt ain't nothing but a breeze\n\nOne day I'll be old gray grandpa\nAll the pretty girls will call me \"Sir\"\nNow, where they're asking me how things are\nSoon they'll ask me how things were\n\nWell, I don't mind being an old gray grandpa\nAs long as you'll be my gray grandma\nBut I wish we would move with our tea and cookies\nTo the shade of the old paw-paw\n\nThere we'll do just as we please\nIt ain't nothing but a breeze\n\nLife is just too short for some folks\nFor other folks it just drags on\nSome folks like the taste of smokey whiskey\nOthers figure tea is too strong\nYou might also likeWell, I'm the type of guy that wants to right down the middle\nI don't like all this bouncing back and forth\nMe, I want to live with my feet in Dixie\nAnd my head in the cool blue North\n\nOh me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie\nAnd my head in the cool blue North, yeah, yeahEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count":

What a generous offer, Taylor.\n\nMS. DARBUS: So many new faces in detention today. I hope you don't make a habit of it, but the drama club can always use an extra hand. And while we are working, let us probe the mounting evils of cell phones.\n\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH GYM, DAY\nCoach Bolton leads basketball practice.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Come on guys, huddle up!

DARBUS: Perhaps the most heinous example of cell phone abuse is ringing in the theater. What temerity! The theater is a temple of art, a precious cornucopia of creative energy.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: (raising his arms in frustration) Where's my team Darbus? What the heck are those two doing in a tree?\n\nMS. DARBUS: (to Coach Bolton) It's called crime and punishment, Bolton. besides, proximity to the arts is cleanzing for the soul.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: (pointing to him and Ms. Darbus) Can we have a talk, please? (to Troy and Chad) And you two, in the gym, now! (pointing to the floor)\nTroy pulls Chad from the tree and they leave.\nCUT TO: INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, DAY\nCoach Bolton and Ms. Darbus stand in front of PrincipalMatsui's desk.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: If they have to paint sets for detention, they could do it tonight, not during my practice.\n\nMS. DARBUS: If these were theater peformers instead of athletes, would you seek special treatment?\n\nCOACH BOLTON: We are days away from out biggest game of the year.\n\nMS. DARBUS: And we, Bolton, are in the midst of auditions for our winter musicale as well! This school is about more than just young men in baggy shorts flinging balls for touchdowns!\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Baskets! They shoot baskets!\n\nPRINCIPAL MATSUI: Stop! Guys, listen. You've been having this arguement since the day you both started teaching here. We are one school, one student body, one faculty! Can we not agree on that?\n\nMs. Darbus and Coach Bolton share a look.\n\nPRINCIPAL MATSUI: So coach, how's the team looking? Troy got 'em whipped into shape?\n\nMrs. Darbus groans and walks away. Principal Matsui shoots a mini basketball to a basket on the wall.\nCUT TO:  INT.

It's time to make our stand.\nThe team is you. You are the team. And this team does not exist unless each and every one of you is fully focused on our goal.

You could be our answered prayer.\n\nGABRIELLA: I'm going to focus on my studies this semester, and help my mom get the new house organized. Maybe next year. But, what do you know about Troy Bolton?\n\nTAYLOR: Troy? Hmm. I wouldn't consider myself an expert on that particular sub-species. However, unless you speak cheerleader, as in (Taylor and Gabriella walk through a group of cheerleaders and Taylor speaks mimicking a Valley-girl accent) \"Oh, my gosh isn't Troy Bolton just a hottie super-bum?\"\n\nThe cheerleaders giggle and exclaim praises. Taylor holds Gabriella's hand and leads her away.\nTAYLOR: See what I mean?\n\nGABRIELLA: I guess I don't know how to speak cheerleader.\n\nTAYLOR: Which is why we exist in an alternate universe to Troy the basketball boy. (rolling eyes)\n\nGABRIELLA: Have you tried to get to know him?\n\nTAYLOR: Watch how it works in the cafeteria tomorrow when you have lunch with us. Unless you'd rather sit with the cheerleaders and discuss the importance of firm nail beds.\n\nGABRIELLA: My nail beds are history.\n\nTaylor and Gabriella show their hands to one another and laugh.\n\nTAYLOR: Sister!\n\nTaylor grabs hold of Gabriella's hand.\nCUT TO: EXT.

(Troy shoots the ball)\nCoach Bolton catches the ball and bounces it.\n\nTROY: Hey dad?\n\nCoach Bolton passes Troy the ball.\n\nTROY: Did you ever think about trying something new, but were afriad of what your friends might think?\n\nCOACH BOLTON: You mean like going left? You're doing fine. Come on.\n\nTroy spins with the ball.\n\nTROY: Well... no. I mean what if you wannna try something really new and it's a total disaster and all your friends laugh at you.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Well then maybe they're not really your friends. I mean, that was my whole point about team today. You guys gotta look out for each other and you're the leader.\n\nTROY: Dad I'm not talking-\n\nCOACH BOLTON: There's gonna be college scouts at our game next week Troy. Know what a scholarship is worth these days?\n\nTroy sighs and nods his head.\n\nTROY: A lot.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Yeah, focus Troy. Come on.\n\nTroy spins and takes a jumpshot.

Troy and Gabriella share a smile.\n\nMS. DARBUS:  Well, I expect we all learned our homeroom manners yesterday people, correct?\n\nTroy looks back at Gabriella, who giggles.\n\nMS. DARBUS: If not, we have some dressing rooms that need painting. Now, a few announcements. This morning during free period will be your chance for the musicale auditions, (Sharpay smiles back at Ryan and claps) both single and pairs. I will be in the theater until noon for thse of you bold enough to extend the wingspan of your creative spirit...

What do you wanna have us run?\n\nTROY: Dude you know what, I can't make it. I, uh, I gotta catch up on some homework.\n\nChad laughs.\n\nCHAD: What? Hello, it's only the second day back. I'm not even behind on homework yet. And you know I've been behind on homework since pre-school.\n\nTroy laughs and puts his arm against Chad's chest, barring him.\n\nTROY: That's hilarious. I'll catch you later.\n\nChad looks puzzled as Troy hurries off.\n\nCHAD: Homework? There's no way.\n\nTroy slinks into a classroom and Chad follows. He watches Troy greet a few students.\n\nCHAD: (whispering to himself) What's he doing?\n\nA student shakes Chad's hand and enters the classroom.\n\nCHAD: Hey, how's it going man?\n\nTroy disappers and Chad looks baffled. In the hallway, Troy sneaks away behind him. Troy hurries down a stairwell. Farther up, Chad stares down with a confused look.\nCUT TO: EXT.

EAST HIGH THEATER, DAY\nTroy walks backstage and hides behind a janitor's cart. He stops behind a prop camel and peers out. Troy glances across the stage at a piano, then eyes the camel's tassles and over-size glasses. He sneaks behind a curtain and watches as Ms. Darbus and theater kids walk in. Troy backs away as Ms. Darbus approaches the stage. Ms. Darbus claps for attention and takes center stage as the students sit down.\n\nMS. DARBUS: This is where the true expression of the artist is realized, where inner truth is revealed through the actor's journey where - (school bell rings) was that a cell phone?\n\nStudents check their pockets.\n\nKELSI: No ma'am, that was the warning bell.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Ah, (touching her glasses) Those wishing to audition must understand that time is of the essence. (Troy walks though the auditorium still hiding behind the mop in the janitor's cart, stopping to hear.) We have many roles to cast and final callbacks will be next week. First you will sing a few bars and I will give you a sense of whether or not the theater is your calling. (tipping her glasses) Better to hear it from me now than from your friends later. Our composer (gesturing towards her) Kelsi Nielson will accompany you and be avaliable for rehearsals prior to callbacks. Shall we?\n\nKelsi plays piano for auditions and mouths the lyrics. Ms. Darbus listens as Sharpay and Ryan grimace.\n\nGIRL: (singing off-key) It's hard to believe that I couldn't see that you were always right beside me. (snapping fingers) This feeling's like no other. I want you to know. (holding hands to chest and hesitating)\n\nMS. DARBUS: Uh-huh, yes. Thank you. (yelling) Next!\n\nALAN: (singing monotonously) It's hard to believe that I couldn't (reading at hand) sneeze... see (Sharpay watches, mouth gaping) that you were always (Ms. Darbus shakes her hand in protest as she drinks from a travel mug) next to-beside me. This feeling's like no other...\n\nMS. DARBUS: Alan, I admire your pluck. As for your singing, that's a wonderful tie you're wearing. (yelling) Next!\n\nAlan touches his tie and smiles. Ms. Darbus takes notes.\n\nGIRL: (leaning on the piano, singing off-key) It's hard to believe that I couldn't see that you were always right beside me. This feeling's like no other I want you to know.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Uh, stop.\n\nCINDRA: (high-pitched)So lonely before I finally found what I've been looking for...\n\nSharpay and Ryan cover an ear and grimace. Kelsi stops playing the piano. Ms. Darbus covers her ears.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Ah, Cindra what courage to pursue a note that has not been accessed in the natural world. Bravo! Brava! Perhaps the spring musicale.\n\nKelsi gives Cindra a look. Cindra scoffs and heads off.\n\nA student leaps onto the stage, pirohuettes and poses. Sharpay holds a hand to her chest. The sudent leaps in the air then continues off-stage. There is a loud crash. Kelsi and Ms. Darbus look concerned.\n\nA pairs audition follows.\n\nGIRL:  It's hard to believe. (opening arms wide) That I could not see (covering eyes with hands)\n\nBOY: See (covers eyes with hand in a sweeping motion)\n\nGIRL: That you were right there beside me (the pair face each other and wiggle their arms) Thought I was alone (Ryan looks tranced) With no one to hold\n\nBOY: To hold (the pair crouches on the floor and holds themselves)\n\nGIRL: But you were right beside me (still crouching, the pair face each other and wiggle their arms)\nThe pair rolls around and crawls on the floor.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Well that was just... very disturbing. Go see a counselor. Next!\n\nThe pair walks offstage.\n\nGabriella walks up to Troy, who is still hiding behind the janitor's cart.\n\nGABRIELLA: Hey!\n\nTroy is startled.\n\nGABRIELLA: So you decided to sign up for something?\n\nTROY: Uh... No! You?\n\nGABRIELLA: No. Why are you hiding behind a mop?\n\nTroy gives a chuckle and moves the cart away.\n\nGABRIELLA: Your friends don't know you're here, right?\n\nTROY: Right.\n\nBoth nod.\nOnstage a student opens her mouth to sing, but hesitates, standing still.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Thank you, next.\n\nThe student runs off.\n\nTROY: Uh, Ms. Darbus is a little... harsh.\n\nGABRIELLA: The wildcat superstar is afraid?\n\nTROY: No, no. I'm not afraid. I'm just, scared.\n\nGABRIELLA: Me too... usually.\n\nMS. DARBUS: And for the lead roles of Minnie and Arnold, we only have one couple signed up, Sharpay and Ryan. I think it might be useful for you to give us a sense of why we gather in this hallowed hall.\n\nThe twins stand. Sharpay flings her sequin jacket over her shoulder and stops Ryan to walk in front. Ryan rolls his eyes. Gabriella and Troy take seats in the back. Shrapay and Ryan walk onstage. Kelsi puts a hand up.\n\nKELSI: What key?\n\nRYAN: Oh, we had our rehearsal pianist do an arrangement.\n\nKELSI: Oh.\n\nRyan walks into place and puts on his hat. Students holds up their microphones. Sharpay snaps and the curtain closes. Behind the curtain, Sharpay and Ryan perform vocal excercises and hand movements.What I've Been Looking For(As the song begins, Sharpay and Ryan stick their hands out the curtain and snap. The curtain rises and they take the microphones to sing. They casually walk on stage and break into poses. They snap side to side and point to one another. Sharpay does a step-touch while Ryan does jazz squares. Ryan passes behind Sharpay. They point to one another. They turn, pretending to be lost, then sing back to back.\nSharpay hands Ryan the microphone and tap dances. Ryan hands Sharpay back her microphone and she continues to sing. Ryan does a one-handed cartwheel. Sharpay and Ryan lean on their knees and pretend to zip their mouths closed. Sharpay covers Ryan's eyes and taps his shoulder. Sharpay spins away from Ryan. Ryan sings directly into the microphone, lifting it up as he moves his head. Sharpay flips her hair back and points to the audience. Ryan and Sharpay walk and snap rythmically across stage. They stop and change directions. Sharpay bumps into Ryan and gives him annoyed look, quickly returning to a smile. They hug themselves and slide in front of/behind each other. They hold each other's microphones and dance. Ryan twirls Sharpay and does a jazzhand. They skip back and forth. Ryan and Sharpay strike poses then freeze in place.)\n\nSHARPAY: (in a hushed tone) I told you not to do the jazz squares.\n\nRYAN: It's a crowd favorite. Everybody loves a good jazz square.\nSharpay glares at Kelsi, who begins to clap, as do the stagehands. They bow and curtsey.\n\nMS. DARBUS: (standing up) Well, are there any last-minute sign-ups?\n\nRYAN: (speaking to a girl) Don't be discouraged. The theater needs more than just singers. It needs fans too. buy tickets.\n\nKelsi runs up to Sharpay.\n\nKELSI: Actually, if you do that part with that particular song, I imagined it much slower.\n\nSHARPAY: If we do the part?\n\nSharpay smirks and looks around.\n\nSHARPAY: Kelsi, my sawed-off Sondheim, I've been in seventeen school productions and how many times have your compositions been selected?\n\nKELSI: This would be the first?\n\nSHARPAY: Which tells us what?\n\nKELSI: Uh, I need to write you more solos?\n\nSHARPAY: No, it tells us that you do not offer direction, suggestion, or commentary. And you should be thankful that me and Ryan are here to lift your music out of it's current obscurity. Are we clear?\n\nKELSI: Yes ma'am. I mean, Sharpay.\n\nSharpay smiles and holds the microphone close.\n\nSHARPAY: (waving) Nice talking to you.\n\nSharpay saunters away.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Any last minute sign-ups?\n\nGabriella looks at Troy.\n\nTROY: (whispering) We should go.\n\nMS. DARBUS: No? Good. Done.\n\nMs. Darbus starts to leave. Gabriella steps out.\n\nGABRIELLA: I'd like to audition, Ms. Darbus.\n\nTROY: (whispering) What!\n\nTroy looks shocked and motions that his mind is blown. He spins and covers his eyes.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Timeliness means something in the world of theater, young lady. The individual auditions are long over and there are simmply no other pairs.\n\nTROY: I'll sing with her!\n\nTroy steps out and puts his hand up.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Troy Bolton, where is your sports possee or whatever it's called?\n\nTROY: Team.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Ahh. (walking towards the pair)\n\nTROY: But I'm here alone. Actually I'm here to sing with her.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Yes, well, we take these shows very seriously here at East High. I called for the pairs audition and you didn't respond. Free period is now over.\n\nMs. Darbus begins walking away.\n\nTROY: She has an amazing voice.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Perhaps the next musical.\n\nKelsi gets up from the piano bench and picks up a stack of music sheets. She trips and they go flying. Gabriella and Troy run over to her to help pick them up.\n\nTROY: You're a composer. You wrote the song Ryan and Sharpay just sang?\n\nKelsi stares.\n\nTROY: And the entire show?\n\nKelsi nods.\n\nTROY: Well that's really cool. I, uh, (Troy holds out his hand) can't wait to hear the rest of the show.\n\nKelsi takes his hand and he helps her up.\n\nTROY: So, why are you so afriad of Ryan and Sharpay. I mean, it is your show.\n\nKELSI: It is?\n\nTROY: Isn't the composer of the show kind of like the playmaker in basketball?\n\nKELSI: Playmaker?\n\nTROY: You know the one that makes everyone else look good. I mean, without you there is no show. You're the playmaker, Kelsi.\n\nKELSI: I am?\n\nTroy nods.\n\nKELSI: Do you want to hear how the duet is supposed to sound?\n\nKelsi sits at the piano. Gabriella and Troy step over as Kelsi sets up sheet music and plays. Kelsi looks pointedly at the music then Troy.What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)(Troy and Gabriella sing the duet as Kelsi plays the piano.)\n\nTROY: Woah, it's nice.\n\nMS. DARBUS: (standing out) Bolton, Montez - you have a callback. Kelsi give them the duet from the second act. Work on it with them.\n\nKELSi: All right. If you guys want to rehearse I'm usually here free period and after school, and even sometimes during biology class. You can come and rehearse anytime. Or you can come to my house for breakfast. I have a piano, we can rehearse there. After school, before school - whatever works. After basketball class...\n\nTroy flips through the sheets.\n\nTROY: What?\n\nCUT TO: EXT. EAST HIGH ENTRANCE, DAY\n\nSHARPAY: (V.O.) Callback!\n\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAY, DAY\n\nSHARPAY: Ahh!\n\nSharpay fans herself as she and her brother stare at the callback sheet.\n\nRYAN: (reading from the Call Back sheet) Callback for roles Arnold and Minnie next Thursday, 3:30 PM. Ryan and Sharpay Evans. Gabriella Montez and Troy Bolton.\n\nSHARPAY: Is this some kind of joke? They didn't even audition!\n\nRYAN: Maybe we're being punked.\n\nSHARPAY: What?\n\nRYAN: Maybe we're being filmed right now. Maybe we'll get to meet Ashton.\n\nSHARPAY: Oh shut up Ryan!\n\nZeke, Chad, and Jason walk up beside them and laugh.\n\nCHAD: What's wrong?\n\nThe basketball players read the list. Chad's face falls and the boys looks confused.\n\nCHAD: What?\n\nChad glances at Ryan and Sharpay in disbelief before walking away. Sharpay storms off and the others step up for a closer look.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH CAFETERIA\n(On the middle level of the cafeteria, Sharpay paces back and forth in front of the railing. Behind her is the thespian posse including Ryan and Kelsi.)\n\nSHARPAY: How dare she sign up? I've already chosen colors for my dressing room!\n\nRYAN: And she hasn't even asked our permission to join the drama club.\nSharpay slams the table.\n\nSHARPAY: Someone's gotta tell her the rules.\n\nRYAN: Exactly. (Ryan pauses) And what are the rules?\n\nSharpay scoffs and walks back to the railing. The camera pans to Chad at a table with jocks and cheerleaders. Behind them, Zeke paces on the platform.\nStick to the Status Quo(Zeke begins to sing and gets his group's attention. He throws a ball to another guy. He steps up and puts his arms around Chad and another jock. The group encourages everyone to move closer. The group looks confused when Zeke tells them he loves to bake. The group dances and pushes down Zeke into his seat.\n\nAt the braniacs table, Martha reads a book and begins to sing. Her friends put their hands towards her and encourage her to share. Martha stands and strikes some hip-hop poses. The braniacs shake their hands no and motion to be quiet. The braniacs take their books and dance. They point to the books and wag their fingers at Martha.At the skater table, another guy begins to share his secret. He plays a cello and motions playing it with his hands. The skaters shake their hands and heads dramatically. They motion skateboarding and shake their arms.\n\nSharpay and Ryan watch the students at the lunch tables below in synchronized dance. The skater plays cello. A cheerleader plays with a basketball. A student break dances on the floor. Martha dances on a table with a jock. A cheerleader ruffles Chad's hair. He tosses a basketball behind him and rolls on the floor before leaping to his feet. The scene becomes more and more chatoic as the different groups begin to intermingle.\n\nSharpay sing in protest as she paces behind the rail. The students begin to become self-conscious and retreating back to their circles. Ryan joins Sharpay at the rail. Sharpay puts a hand up to stop  Ryan and sing. They sing together.\n\nThe students are all seated. The skater pops up from the table and is pulled down by his posse. Martha stands and her posse shakes their hands. Zeke puts a knee up on the table seat, holding cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The jocks put their fingers to their hands and Zeke's cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e flips over.\n\nSharpay yells. Taylor and Gabriella walk in.)\n\nGABRIELLA: Why is everybody staring at you?\n\nTAYLOR: Not me, you.\n\nGABRIELLA: (distressed) Because of the callbacks? I can't have people staring at me! I really can't!(Cont.) Stick to the Status Quo(The students perform a synchronized dance at the lunch tables. Sharpay and Ryan walk down the stairs as the other students continue dancing. Taylor and Gabriella walk through the crowd. Gabriella slips in milk and her cheese fries land on Sharpay.)\n\nSHARPAY: Ahhh!\n\nGabriella tries to wipe Sharpay's jacket. The jocks stare.\n\nGABRIELLA: I am so sorry.\n\nTaylor steers her away. Chad grabs hold of Troy.\n\nCHAD: You do not want to get into that man. (pointing to Sharpay) Too much drama.\n\nTROY: Yeah.\n\nMS. DARBUS: What is going on here?\n\nThe cafeteria stares at Sharpay. She takes a deep breath.\n\nSHARPAY: Look at this! That Gabriella girl just dumped her lunch on me, on purpose. It's all part of their plan to ruin our musical. And Troy and his baskeball robots are obviously behind it. Why do you think he auditioned? After all the hard work you've put into the show, it just doesn't seem right!\n\nStudents move aside as Sharpay runs upstairs. Ms. Darbus walks off. Ryan looks down at the cheese fries.\n\nTROY: (to Chad) What's up?\n\nCHAD: What's up? Oh, let's see... um. You missed free period workout yesterday to audition for some heinous musical And now suddenly people are... confessing.\n\nChad pulls Zeke towards them. Zeke still hold the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nCHAD: Yeah, and Zeke. Zeke is baking. Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e!\n\nTROY: Oh what's that?\n\nZEKE: Oh, it's a creamy custard-like filling with a caramelized surface. It's really satisfying.\nTroy and Zeke nod their heads excitedly.\n\nCHAD: Shut up Zeke!\n\nZeke's face falls and he walks up to the skater. The fist bump. CHad and Troy go to the table.\n\nCHAD: Look, you see what's happening here man? Our team is coming apart because of your singing thing. Even the drama geeks and the braniacs suddenly think they can... talk to us. Look the skater dudes are mingling. (Chad points to the skaters talking with Zeke) Suddenly people think that they can do other stuff. Stuff that is not their stuff. They've got you thinking about show tunes when we've got a playoff game next week.\n\nCUT TO: INT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, DAY\nCoach Bolton sits at his desk. He has a pencil behind his ear and eats a sandwich. He reads a newspaper showing Troy shooting a layup. The headline reads, \"Knights to battle Wildcats for District Playoffs\". Ms. Darbus walks in. Teen boys in towels see her as they emerge from the showers and she averts her eyes. Someone throws a towel which nearly hits her. Ms. Darbus enters Coach Bolton's office, shakes her scarf, and removes her glasses. He looks up.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Alright Bolton. Cards on the table right now.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Huh?\n\nMS. DARBUS: You're tweaked because I put your stars in detention and now you're getting even.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: What are you talking about Darbus? (putting down his newspaer)\n\nMS. DARBUS: Your all-star son turned up at my audition. Now I give every student an even chance, which is a long and honorable tradition in the theater. Something you wouldn't understand, but if her is planning any sort of practical joke in my chapel of the arts-\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Troy doesn't even sing.\n\nMS. DARBUS: Oh, well, you're wrong about that, but I will not allow my \"Twinkle Towne\" musicale to be made into farce.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: \"Twinkle Towne\"?\n\nMS. DARBUS: See, I knew it. (wagging a finger)\n\nCOACH BOLTON: (smiling) Hey...\n\nMS. DARBUS: I knew it. (putting on her glasses)\nMs. Darbus storms out.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Sounds like a winner. Good luck on Broadway.\n\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH CAFETERIA, DAY\n\nGABRIELLA: Is Sharpay really really mad at me? I said I was sorry.\n\nTAYLOR: Look, no one has beaten Sharpay out for a musical since kindergarten.\n\nGABRIELLA: I wasn't trying to beat anyone out. We didn't even audition, we were just singing.\n\nTAYLOR: You won't convince Sharpay of that. I'm telling you, if that girl could figure out a way to play both Romeo and Juliet, her own brother would be aced out of a job.\n\nGABRIELLA: I told you, it just happened, but I liked it. A lot. Did you ever feel like there's this whole other person inside of you just looking for a way to come out?\n\nTAYLOR: Not really, no.\n\nThey look at each other, smile, and chuckle. The school bell rings.\n\nTAYLOR: Let's go.\n\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAYS, DAY\nZeke walks up to Sharpay's locker.\n\nZEKE: Hey Sharpay. Um, I just thought since Troy Bolton's gonna be in your show...\n\nSHARPAY: (puts a finger up to silence him) Troy Bolton is not in my show.\n\nSharpay pulls a shirt on a hanger from her locker.\n\nZEKE: OK, um. Well I just thought maybe, uh, you could watch me play ball sometime.\n\nSHARPAY: I'd rather stick pins in my eyes.\n\nZEKE: Wouldn't that be awfully uncomfortable?\n\nSHARPAY: Evaporate tall person!\n\nSharpay slams the locker and walks away. Zeke watches.\n\nZEKE: I bake! If that helps...\n\nLooking dejected, he leans against the wall.The camera cuts to Gabriella at her locker. As she opens it, a piece of paper falls. She opens it and smiles. She puts it back in her locker.\nCUT TO: EXT. EAST HIGH ROOFTOP, DAY\nTroy waits at the garden rooftop as Gabriella climbs up the stairs, smiling widely.\n\nGABRIELLA: (looking around) Wow, it's like a jungle out here.\n\nTROY: Yeah, just like that cafeteria.\n\nGABRIELLA: Well, I just humiliated myself into the next century.\n\nTROY: No, come on.\n\nGABRIELLA: So this is your private hideout?\n\nTROY: Yeah, thanks to the science club. Which means my buddies don't even know it exisits.\n\nGABRIELLA: You pretty much have the school wired, don't you Troy? Seems to me like everyone on campus wants to be your friend.\n\nTROY: (laughs) Unless we lose.\n\nGABRIELLA: Well I'm sure it's tricky being the coach's son.\n\nTROY: Makes me practice a little harder, I guess.\nI don't know what he's gonna say when he finds out about the singing.\n\nGABRIELLA: You worried?\n\nTROY: My parent's friends are always saying, \"Your son's the basketball guy. You must be so proud.\"\n\nTroy stares off solemly.\n\nTROY: Sometimes I don't wanna be the basketball guy. I wanna be a guy. You know?\n\nGABRIELLA: I saw the way you treated Kelsi at the audition yesterday. Do your friends know that guy?\n\nTroy sighs.\n\nTROY: To them, I'm the playmaker dude.\n\nGABRIELLA: They don't know enough about you Troy. At my other schools I was the freaky math girl. It's cool coming here and being anyone I wanna be. When I was singing with you, I just felt like a girl.\n\nTROY: (pointing) You even looked like one too.\n\nGabriela laughs. Troy sits beside her on a bench.\n\nGABRIELLA: Remember in kindergarten how you'd meet a kid and know nothing about them. Than ten seconds later you play like you're best friends because you didn't have to be anything but yourself?\n\nTROY: Yeah.\n\nGABRIELLA: Singing with you felt like that.\n\nTROY: Well, uh... I never thought about singing, that's for sure. Till you.\n\nGABRIELLA: So you really wanna do the callbacks?\n\nTROY: Hey, just call me freaky callback boy.\n\nGABRIELLA: You're a cool guy Troy. But not for the reasons your friends think. And thanks for showing me your top secret hiding place. Like kindergarten.\n\nThey smile at each other and look away. The bell rings. Troy grabs Gabriella's hand and they hurry down the stairs.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH MUSIC ROOM, DAY\nKelsi plays the piano.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAYS, DAY\nTroy leans on the stair railway reading sheet music.\nTROY: (singing) We're soaring, flying. There's not a star in heaven that we can't reach...\nRyan heads upstairs and hears Troy singing. He presses his ear up to the door. He jiggles the door handle, but it's locked.\nTROY: ...If we're trying, then we're breaking...\nTroy notices the handle jiggling. Ryan drops to the floor and peeks through the gap in the door. He stands, looking puzzled.\nCUT TO: INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM, DAY\nGabriella stands reading sheet music.\nGABRIELLA: (singing) creating space between us til we're separate hearts\nIn the hall, Sharpay hears Gabriella and perks up. She enters the bathroom and Gabriella panics.\n\nSharpay glances towards the sink and sees no one. Sharpay eyes the stalls and kicks one open, giving a yell. She turns and looks at the mirrors, checking herself out. She leaves the bathroom and Gabriella emerges from behind a wall and watches her go, breathing a sigh of relief.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH MUSIC ROOM, DAY\nGabriella sits beside Kelsi, who plays the piano.\nGABRIELLA: (singing) There's not a star in heaven that we...\nThe scene changes and it is now Troy practicing with Kelsi.

Good hustle. Let's see that in the game.\n\nTroy arrives as the team leaves. Chad hands him a basketball.\n\nTROY: I, uh, think I'm gonna stay awhile. Work on some free throws.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Well since you missed practice, I think your team deserves a little effort from you today.\n\nCoach Bolton stalks away. Troy wears a guilty expression.\n\nGabriella appraoches Troy as he takes a shot.\n\nGABRIELLA: Wow, so this is your real stage.\n\nTROY: Yeah, I guess you could call it that. Or just a smelly gym.\n\nTroy hands Gabriella the ball. She takes a shot and makes it.\n\nTROY: Woah! Don't tell me you're good at hoops too.\n\nGABRIELLA: You know, I once scored 41 points at a league championship game.\n\nTROY: No way.\n\nGABRIELLA: Mmmhmm. And the same day I invented the space shuttle and microwave popcorn.\n\nTROY: Microwave popcorn. Haha funny.\n\nTroy takes a shot and makes it.\n\nGABRIELLA: I've been rehearsing with Kelsi\n\nTROY: Me too. And, uh, by the way, uh. I missed practice. So if I get kicked off the team it should be on your conscience.\n\nGABRIELLA: Hey I wasn't the one who told you-\n\nTROY: Gabriella, chill.\n\nShe takes the ball and runs.\n\nTROY: Hey that's traveling. No, that's really bad traveling.\n\nTroy catches up to her. He picks her up from behind and spins her. They laugh. Coach Bolton walks in.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Miss, I'm sorry. This is a closed practice.\n\nTroy smiles awkwardly.\n\nTROY: Dad come on, practice is over.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Not till the last player leaves the gym. Team rule.\n\nGABRIELLA: Oh, sorry, sir.\n\nTROY: Um, dad, this is Gabriella Montez.\n\nGabriella holds out a hand.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Ah your detention buddy.\n\nGabriella's smile fades and she retracts her hand awkwardly.\n\nGABRIELLA: I'll see you later Troy. (handing Troy the ball) Nice meeting you Coach Bolton.\n\nCoach Bolton nods. Gabriella jogs away.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: You as well, Miss Montez.\n\nTROY: Dad, detention was my fault, not hers.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: You haven't missed practice in three years. That girl shows up (pointing)\n\nTROY: That girl is named Gabriella. She's very nice.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: Helping you miss practice doesn't make her very nice. Not in my book or your team's.\n\nTROY: Dad, she's not a problem. She's just a girl.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: But you're not just a guy, Troy.\nYou're the team leader.\nWhat you do affects not only this team, but the entire school. And withut you completely focused, we're not gonna win next week. The championship games, they don't come along all the time. They're something special.\n\nTROY: Yeah, well, a lot of things are special Dad.\n\nCOACH BOLTON: But you're a playmaker, not a singer, right?\n\nTROY: Did you ever think that maybe I could be both?\nCoach Bolton looks taken aback. Troy drops the ball and walks off, revealing his teammates hiding by the gym door.\n\nCHAD: Let's go.\n\nThe team follows Troy.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH LIBRARY, DAY\nTroy looks for a book as Chad follows him.\n\nCHAD: What spell has this elevated-IQ temptress girl cast that suddenly makes you (pointing) want to be in a musical?\n\nTROY: (putting hands up) Look, I just did it. Who cares?\n\nCHAD: Who cares? (grabbing Troy's shoulder) How about your most loyal best friend?\n\nMISS FALSAFF: (emerging from between the bookshelves) Quiet in here Mr. Danforth\n\nMISS FALSAFF: It's him, Miss Falsaff, not me. (to Troy) Look, you're a hoops dude (handing Troy a basketball) not a musical singer person.\n\nTroy walks forward and tosses the basketball back to Chad. Chad runs up.\n\nCHAD: Have you ever seen Michael Crawford on a cereal box?\n\nTROY: (taking a book form a shelf) Who's Michael Crawford?\n\nCHAD: Exactly my point!\n\nTroy fips a page in the dictionary on a pedestal. Chad places his ball on top to stop him.\n\nCHAD: He was the Phantom of the Opera on Broadway. Now my mom, she's seen that musical 27 times and she put Michael Crawford's picture in our refrigerator. Yeah, not on it. In it. So my point is if you play basketball you're gonna end up on a cereal box. If you sing in musicals, you're gonna end up in my mom's refrigerator.\n\nTROY: Why would she put his picture in her refrigerator?\n\nCHAD: One of her crazy diet ideas. Look I don't attempt to understand the female mind Troy.\n\nMiss Falsaff pokes her head out and looks at them. Both boys looks away.\n\nCHAD: It's frightening territory. (as the boys walk away)\nTroy sits down with the book at a table. Chad puts one foot up on the seat beside him and places his basketball on the table.\n\nCHAD: How can you expect the rest of us to be focused on a game if you're off somewhere in leotards singing (Chad motions jazz hands) \"Twinkle Towne\"?\n\nTROY: No one said anything about leotards.\n\nCHAD: Not yet my friend, but just you wait. We need you captain, big time.\n\nMISS FALSAFF: Mr. Danforth\n\nChad puts his hands up, feigning innocence.\n\nCHAD: I tried to tell him Miss Falsaff. (to Try) Really tried.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM AT EAST HIGH, DAY\nZeke, Chad, and Jason enter the classroom as Sharpay sees from the hallway. She pulls Ryan towards her.\n\nSHARPAY: Something isn't right.\n\nThey walk up to the door and watch the basketball players approach Taylor.\n\nCHAD: Hey look, we need to talk.\n\nTAYLOR: Go.\n\nRYAN: (whispering) They must be trying to figure out a way to make sure Troy and Gabriella actually beat us out. (Sharpay grimaces) The jocks run most of the school, but if they get Troy into the musical then they've conquered the entire student body.\n\nSHARPAY: And if those science girls get Gabriella hooked up with Troy Bolton, the scholastic club goes from drool to cool. Ryan, we need to save our show from people who don't know the difference between a Tony Award and Tony Hawk.\n\nThey saunter away.\n\nTAYLOR: Do you really think that's gonna work?\n\nCHAD: It's the only way to save Troy and Gabriella from themselves. So we on?\n\nTAYLOR: Yeah.\n\nCHAD: Good, so we start tomorrow then.\n\nTAYLOR: OKay, the first thing.\n\nCHAD: Nice. (to Jason and Zeke) Let's gp.\n\nCUT TO: EXT.

(waving her hand in his face) But we're not Charlie's Angels, okay?\n\nTaylor hands Chad her laptop.\n\nCHAD: I can dream, can't I?\n\nTaylor rolls her eyes and walks away. Chad heads off, in a creeping motion.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAYS, DAY\nStudents filter down the stairs. The school bell rings.\nCUT TO: INT.

Also known a \"Sammy Slamma Jamma\". Captain MVP of the league championship game.\n\nJASON: The \"Thunder Clap\" (team claps) Hap Hadden, '95. Led the Wildcats to back-to-back city championships. A legend.\n\nCHAD: Yes, legends, one and all. But do you think that any of these Wildcat legeds became legends by getting involved in musical auditions just days before their league championships?\n\nBASKETBALL TEAM: Get your head in the game!\n\nCHAD: No. These Wildcat legends became legends because they never took their eye off the prize.\n\nBASKETBALL TEAM: Get your head in the game!\n\nCHAD: Now, who was the first sophmore ever to make starting varsity?\n\nBASKETBALL TEAM: Troy!\n\nCHAD: Who voted him our team captain this year?\n\nBASKETBALL TEAM: Us!\n\nCHAD: And who is gonna get their sorry butts kicked in Friday's championship game if Troy's worried about an audition?\n\nBASKETBALL TEAM: We are.\n\nTROY: Guys, come on. There's twelve people on this team, not just me.\n\nCHAD: Just twelve? Oh no.\n\nChad makes a beckoning motion.\n\nCHAD: I think you're missing a very important thirteenth member of our squad.\n\nChad hands an upside down picture frame to Troy. Troy flips it over and sees a teenage basketball player in a Wildcats uniform.\n\nTROY: My dad.\n\nCHAD: Yes, Troy. Wildcats basketball champion, class of 1981. Champion, father, and now coach. (shaking his head) It's a winning tradition like no other.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM AT EAST HIGH, DAY\nGabriella sits on a stool. Taylor fronts the braniacs and presents on a laptop to her.\n\nTAYLOR: From lowly Neandrathal and Cro-Magnon, to early warriors and medevial knights. All leading up to...\n\nA student reveals a poster of a basketball player with a picture of Troy's head pasted on top.\n\nTAYLOR: ...lunkhead basketball man. Yes, our culture worshipped the aggressor throughout the ages and we end up with spoiled, overpaid, bonehead athletes who contribute little to civilization other than (gesturing to the poster) slam dunks and touchdowns. That is the inevitable world of Troy Bolton.\n\nGabriella looks amused. A student puts up the poster.\n\nTAYLOR: But the path of the mind, the path we're on, ours is the path that has brought us to these people: (each person mentioned appears on the slideshow) Eleanor Roosevelt, Frida Kahlo, Sandra Day O'Connor, Madame Curie, Jane Goodall, Oprah Winfrey, and so many others who the world reveres.\n\nGABRIELLA: Ah, but what is... I've got Kelsi waiting for me to rehearse.\n\nTAYLOR: Gabriella! Troy Bolton represents one side of evolution. And our side, the side of education (slams pointer) and accomplishment (slams pointer) is the future of civilization. This is the side where you belong.\n\nCUT TO: INT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM, DAY\n\nTROY: Guys, if you don't know that I'll put 110 percent of my guts into that game, then you don't know me.\n\nCHAD: But we just thought-\n\nTROY: I'll tell you what I thought. I thought that you're my friends. Win together, lose together, teammates.\n\nCHAD: (propping up the laptop) But suddenly the girl, and the singing.\n\nTROY: Man, I'm for the team! (a teammate discreetly records Troy) I've always been for the team. She's just someone I met.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM AT EAST HIGH, DAY\nGabriella waches a livestream of Troy talking and furrows her brow.\n\nTROY: All right, the singing thing is nothing. Just a way to keep my nerves down. It all means nothing to me. You're my guys and this is our team. Gabriella is not important. I'll forget about her. I'll forget the audition and we'll go out and get that championship. Everyone happy now?\n\nTAYLOR: Behold, lunkhead basketball man.\n\nA tear rolls down Gabriella's face. The braniacs walk away, except Taylor.\n\nTAYLOR: So Gabriella, we would love to have you for the scholastic decathalon. Did you wanna grab some lunch?\n\nGabriella smiles solemly and shakes her head.\n\nTAYLOR: Well, we'll be there if you wanna come.\n\nGabriella nods.\nCUT TO: INT.

She continues on and walks along an empty hallway.)\nGabriella turns the corner to her locker. Troy walks up and puts a hand on her locker..\n\nTROY: Hey, how you doing?\n\nGabriella ignores him.\n\nTROY: Listen, there's something I wanna talk to you about.\n\nGABRIELLA: And here it is. I know what it's like to carry a load with your friends. I get it. You've got your boys Troy. It's okay. So we're good.\n\nTROY: (looking slightly puzzled) Good about what? I was gonna talk to you about the final callbacks.\n\nGABRIELLA: I don't wanna do the callbacks either. Who are we trynig to kid? You've got your team and I've got mine. I'll do the scholastic decathalon and you'll win the championships. It's where we belong. (pulling out sheet music and handing it to Troy) Go wildcats.\n\nTROY: But I-\n\nGABRIELLA: Me neither.\n\nGabriella leaves.

Coach Bolton looks on concernedly Troy lays down on the grass and puts his arms over his face, frustrated. Coach Bolton goes back inside.\nCUT TO: EXT. MONTEZ HOME, DAY\nGabriella steps out onto the balcony and stares off. She heaves a sigh.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH CAFETERIA, DAY\nTroy enters the cafeteria with a bagged lunch and milk carton.

Troy starts to go.\n\nCHAD: (lifting a hand up) Troy, hey\n\nTroy shakes his head faintly and leaves. Gabriella wears a miserable look. Chad and Taylor step away from their tables with guilty expressions.\nCUT TO: EXT. EAST HIGH ROOFTOP, DAY\nTroy sits alone among the plants. Chad, Zeke, and Jason climb up the stairs and approach.\n\nCHAD: Hey, um, we just had another team meeting.\n\nTROY: Oh, wonderful.\n\nCHAD: We had a team meeting about how we haven't been acting like a team.\n\nChad, Zeke, and Jason nod their heads.\n\nCHAD: (gesturing) I mean us, not you. Look, about the singing thing, we-\n\nTROY: Look, dude I don't even wanna talk about it.\n\nCHAD: We just want you to know we're gonna be there. OKay, cheering for you.\n\nTROY: Huh?\n\nZEKE: Yeah, if singing is something you wanna do, we should be boosting you up, not tearing you down.\n\nCHAD: Yeah, win or lose, we're teammates. That's what we're about. Even if you turn out to be the worst singer in the world.\n\nChad punches Troy on the shoulder.\n\nJASON: (stepping forward) Which, you know, we don't you because we haven't actually hears you sing.\n\nThe boys agree.\n\nTROY: And you're not gonna hear me sing, guys. (nodding) 'Cause Gabriella won't even talk to me... and I don't know why.\n\nTroy's teammmates wear guilty expressions. Chad sighs.\n\nCHAD: We do.\n\nZEKE: (pulling out baked good from his lunch bag and handnig them to Troy) I baked these fresh today. You probably want to try one before we tell you the rest.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM AT EAST HIGH, DAY\nGabriella looks at a textbook and does a chemistry equation on the chalkboard. Taylor and the braniacs walk up.\n\nTAYLOR: Gabriella, we were jerks. No, we were worse than jerks because we were mean jerks. We thought that Troy and the whole singing thing were killing our chances of having you on the scholastic decathalon team.\n\nGABRIELLA: I heard what he had to say. I'm on your team now. Done.\n\nTAYLOR: No, not done. We knew that Chad could get Troy to make him say things to make you want to forget about the callbacks. We planned it, and we're embarassed and sorry.\n\nGABRIELLA: No one forced Troy to say anything. And you know what, it's okay. We should be preparing for the decathalon now, so it's time to move on.\n\nTAYLOR: No, it's not okay. The decathalon is whatever, but how you feel about us and even more, Troy, that's what really matters.\n\nGabriella stares at Taylor, then turns back to her work.

MONTEZ: Oh, Troy!\n\nGabriella stands at the stairs and mouths \"No\".\n\nMS. MONTEZ: Um... Gabriella is kind of busy with homework and such, so now's not really a good time.\n\nTROY: I made a mistake, Ms. Montez, and I would really like to let Gabriella know that. Could you tell her that I came by to see her?\n\nMS. MONTEZ: (nodding) I will, Troy. Goodnight.\n\nTROY: Goodnight, thank you.\n\nTroy walks away and Gabriella's mom shuts the door. Handsin his pocket, Troy steps on the lawn and pauses. He glances at the house and wears a thoughtful expression as he walks off. He sneaks into the backyard and makes a call on his cellphone.\nCUT TO: INT. MONTEZ HOME, NIGHT\nIn her room, Gabriella reads as her phone starts ringing. She picks it up and answers it.\n\nGABRIELLA: Hello?\n\nTROY: What you heard...\n\nCUT TO: EXT. MONTEZ HOME, NIGHT\n\nTROY: ...the other day, none of that is true.

MONTEZ HOME, NIGHT\n\nGABRIELLA:...treating you differently because of it\n\nTROY: Maybe that's because I don't only want to be the basketball guy. They can't handle it. That's not my problem, it's theirs.\n\nGABRIELLA: But your dad?\n\nTROY: And it's not about my dad. This is about how I feel and I'm not letting the team down. (Gabriella walks to her bedpost and leans) They let me down. So I'm gonna sing. What about you?\n\nGABRIELLA: I don't know Troy.\n\nTROY: Well you need to say yes because I brought you something.\n\nGABRIELLA: What do you mean?\n\nTROY: Turn around.\n\nTurning, Gabriella finds Troy stading outside on her balcony. She sets the phone aside and opens her door.\n\nTROY: (singing) This could be the start of something new. It feels so right to be here with you, oh. And now looking in your eyes, I feel in my heart, the start of something (spoken) new.\nGabriella smiles tearfully. Troy holds up the sheet music.\n\nTROY:  It's a pairs audition.\n\nNodding, Gabriella steps outside and takes the music. As she walks past him, he cracks a grin.

Go ahead and put five grams of this in. (as a student pours in a purple powder and the mixture fizzez) And that causes it to change from an acidic state causing the color to change from pink to blue. Just like those pH test strips. (looking at the clock) Oh, gotta go. See you guys later.\n\nRushing out, Gabriella removes her apron and sets it on a hook.\nCUT TO: INT. EAST HIGH HALLWAYS, DAY\nTroy slows his run and leans casually against the lockers. He peers at his wrist, which has no watch.

my\u2005part\u2005is\nI hear my\u2005own voice\nI make my own choice\nI\u2005guess, we're fuckin' doing it\nThe horse is out the gates\nIt's\u205ftime\u205fto\u205fstart the race\nShoutout\u205fto Kathy Bates\u205fand also Betty White\nAll the people, if you're the type\nI wanna say that you're equal on the mic\nBut nobody's equal to me\nNobody is coming for my neck\nI am looking for respect\nI'm not looking for a check\nUnless it is for my friends\nThat's why we're doing this\nTo make some pennies\nAnd maybe make amends\nSailors in the sea might get the bends\nThat is my fuckin' dream\nTo go with James Cameron in a submarine\nTo the bottom of the ocean\nRocking forth with the motion\nMe and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion\nSharing our emotion\nDaring you to fuck with us\nAt the sea, at a deep water vent\nBut we don't got the bends, we're not bent\nI think that's what I'm meant to do\nMe and my crew\nGigantic, looking to cross the sea\nFor the Titanic\nOh shit, you mean they found it?\nAlready? They'd abounded with treasure?\nMan, that doesn't give me pleasure\nI don't know how to measure\nHow I feel about that shit\nBut that won't make me quit\nIn my quest, to scour the deep sea\nLike, you and me?\nSearching for an angle, mangled\nThe corpse in the Bermuda Triangle\nMaybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane\nWe're like \"oh, shit, what remains\"\nAnd\nThen we get to the bottom\nAmelia Earhart's like \"oh, shit, got em!\"\nYou didn't know, but I was an immortal\nI just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal\nShuffled off my fucking mortal coil\nMortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil\nAll my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal\nAnd you know, I am not gonna take a foil\nTo my head in a little tin cap shape\nBecause you know I'm great\nI popped the grape\nBut I'm not on some conspiracies\nI'm just trying to see what's up in the seas\nI believe that I will not cease and desist\nYou cannot resist\nWhen I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist\nI am in Manila, in Hong Kong\nIn San Francisco, doing a disco\nPop it hot like it's Crisco\nBut I gotta pace myself\nIf we're gonna raise this wealth\nThat's why I flow at this tempo\nHello, I do kempo\nIn my mind, that's a form of martial arts\nBut I take, partial starts\nAnd I just gave little partial farts\nWhen I'm shitting on the mic\n'Cause you know I got this heart\nAnd you know I got the K-Mart\nState-of-the-art mind\nBut I'm not be-hind\nNo, I'm way out in the front\nRolling up a 30-foot blunt\nAnd you know I'm not gonna bunt\nIn a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger\nBecause I am the rap ringer\nI never make the wrong call\nAnd you know, chicks dig the long ball!\nI am like (Ah)\nThey are like (Wow)\nWatsky, you cannot stop me\nI got no paparazzi\nI'm a fucking doorstep\nI'm gonna take one more step\nAnd then, take another\nWord, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'\nHere I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada\nJust keep rappin', yada yada yada\nHey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld\nMe and him, it's like a fuckin' mind meld\nOr maybe it's more like Larry David\nBecause you know we're not playing\nShoutout to the Jews, the chosen people\nYou know that you cannot fuckin' lose\nBut also, shoutout to the Christians\nShoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions\nYou know you cannot stop it\nAlso, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith\nWho know we're gonna make way\nFor the Jehovah's Witnesses\nThey got their hit list-esses\nWalking up to the different fuckin' doors\nSaying \"Would you like to love God a little more?\"\nBut it kinda sucks, just because of COVID\nThey can't be making no bids\nI heard they're not doing that door-knockin'\nBut, you know, we're not stoppin'\nHowever you appraise 'em\nNo, we are fuckin' raising\nOn the mic I'm fuckin' blazing\nIf the sun is blazing\nI turn into a raisin\nI'm bringing this whole craze\nFor almost two whole days\nI don't think that's possible\nI don't think that's wise\nI don't think that's probable\nThat is what they say when they look in to my eyes\nMy momma was afraid for me\nShe busted in like the ma\u00eetre d\nShe said \"Hello umm\"\nI don't think you wanna sit here\nI don't think you wanna get here\n'Cause you might die\nYou know but then I was like \"I gotta try\"\nI gotta try to do the right thing\nShoutout to Spike Lee\nI'm gonna try to get the ring\nTry to get the bling\nTry to be the king of the long raps\nLike I was the dude with the ass raps\nDoesn't matter\nAs long as the people fuckin' clap\nAs long as we give a little joy\nGive em dat'\nThen I will cut the crap\nI guess I am a believer\nAnd I don't care that I got seizures\nI got my fuckin' pills\nI'm gonna take 'em right around midnight\nSo I can get right\nI think that's what I gotta do\nShout out to the medical commun-\nItty I just get gritty\nI hope my rhymes are not shitty\nUmm, mic check are you with me?\nShout-out Bobby and Whitney\nBut not shout out to the bad things he did\nI don't know if I'm gonna have a kid\nI don't know if I'm gonna raise a child\nBut it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild\nThey would make be fuckin' smile\nThey got fuckin' bile and some guts\nEverybody does\nEverybody got guts\nEverybody got nuts\nOr half the people maybe like 48.7%\nThat's about how it went\nI think that is the percentage-ish\nOf the gender fuckin' separation\nAlthough we know in this nation\nThings are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient\nIf you don't understand\nI got my fuckin' rhymes on demand\nI can run it back\nBut I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness\nIf I'm trying to fuckin' win this\nI will not get winded, I have not rescinded\nAnything that I've fucking said\nBy the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead\nI'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds\nThat is like Right Said Fred\nYou just gotta relax\nIf you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe\nI don't get lyrical cataracts\nSo I can see clearly, so I can be dearly\nReceived, I've got to achieve\nWhatever I've got up my sleeve\nWhatever I've got in my pouch\nShoutout to pouch, ouch\nI pricked my finger, that is not true\nBut on this mic I will linger for you\nAnd for my crew\nThis is what I've got to do\nI've got to drop it hot for you\n'Cause this is why I'm hot\nThis is why I'm not\nShoutout to Mims\nShoutout to Hims\nThat's that brand of underwear\nThat I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway\nI'm drivin' down the one way\nI'm cruisin' up the runway\nSpreading my wings\nLike I am a Cessna\nLike I am a chestnut\nRoastin' on an open fire, bing!\nCrosby, you got me\nMe, hot see?\nMe Watsky\nSee?\nSittin' in the hot seat\nNo, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat\nBut that word, beats droppin' me\nAnd meha coppin'\nShoutout to Frank Macoppin\nPlayground\nIn the fuckin' San Francisco SFC\nBecause you know how this go\nWe are the best in Dolores Park\nWe have a chorus singin' in the dark\nHark, the angel\nShoutout to Chuck Rangel\nRangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but\nIn December maybe I will be dismembered\nBy a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa\nComin' down my chimney\nWavin' fuckin' butcher knives\nThat\u2019d be fucking crazy\nWho is he\nWho is this robotic crazy Santa\nOh my \u2018lanta\nI can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s tryna get me\nInstead of giving me presents\nI can't believe that he got me on the ground\nBut I'm like \"no I'm Watsky\"\nAnd Santa said \"oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude\"\nBut I'm like \"that's rude\nSanta you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'\nPlus I was in the nude\nHe got me tackled on the ground\nMy fuckin' whole brood around me\nAnd I got my whole butt out\nHe's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away\nCut-out\nCut it out like on Full House\nJohn Stamos\nJohn Stains-Most in his pants\nBut that's okay\nWe don't judge people who like to dance away the day\nIf they need a Pepto-Bismol\nMy throat is not abysmal\nThis all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt\nI will not repent\nAnd I\u2019m not demented\nBut I meant it\nWhen I sent it\nFrom my brain\nI'm not plain\nIm not fuckin' around\nI\u2019m not cluckin' the ground\nJust right there it\u2019s only two feet\nThat\u2019s pretty cool man I eat\nFrom that cup right there\nThe one that\u2019s floatin' up in the air\nIt\u2019s got a fuckin' strawber-\n-ry smoothie\nI flow very smoothly\nBut you cannot do me\nDo me, do me like that\nI got that roomie type rap\nIt\u2019s mad philosophical\nI just keep on droppin' all\nOf the marbles in my brain\nThey\u2019re comin' out my nose\nAnd then they just remain\nOn the ground\nEven the cat\u2019s eye\nThat is my favorite fuckin' marble that passed by\nDid you know at places\nPeople on the internet watch marble races\nI watched one\nIt was mad fun\nI picked the fuckin' blue marble\nAnd my pick wasn't all garbled\nIt came down the shoot\nIt was going all fuckin' cool\nAnd then it fuckin scooted past the red one\nThat kid from The Shining like Red-Rum\nMeaning murder\nWorder\nWordier\nAll my flows are so dirtier\nThan you could even fuckin' guess\nI'm not even fucking stressed\nI'm so damn relaxy\nShout out to a Maxi-Pad\nFor being so absorbent\nThat's a good fuckin' fuction\nMy girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it\nPut her hands in the air\nMaxi Pads doing what they do down there\nIf you are shaved or if you've got hair\nIt doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare\nDo what you wanna\nWord to your mama\nYour dude can't tell you what you gotta do\nGotta do what you wanna\nMake your own choice\nWith your body or your voice\nIf you are moist\nI know some people don't like that word\nPalabra\nBut you know you gotta like what you like\nThere was this one time this dude named Ike\nRan to be Prez\nAnd he fuckin' won\nEisenhower, that's what I said\nI's a power-rapper\nYes I am\nSo fuckin' dapper\nThe clapper\nDoesn't work on the lights on this green screen\nMan, that would be a dream scene\nIf I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want\nWhat I want, damn\nThat would be no scam\nI don't eat no Spam\nThat's 'cause I am a soft boy\nAnd I only eat Bok-Choy\n'Cause I'm a little veggie human\nAnd that's what I be doin'\nLet me clarify\nLike clarified butter\nAgain, word to your mother\nAnd also not to digress\nBut I gotta get it off of my chest\nWord to Mark Wahlberg\nWord to ballers\nWait, okay, let me make my main point\nAs I rap over this joint\nAnd that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy\nI also eat soy\nI also as a Jewish type dude not a goy\nGet lots of joy out of eatin' carrots\nOut of eatin' broccoli\nOut of eatin' lots of trees\nOut of smokin' lots of trees\nThat is true\nThat is not\nI don't smoke a lot\nBut I do when I party\nBut during COVID, I party hardly\nAnd I guess that's kinda sad\nBut I've had some calls with my dad\nPaul Watsky\nAnd Claire Watsky\nIt's rare, stop me\nIt's not, lots of Sundays\nI call my parentals\nAnd I just steal out my fuckin' mentals\nBut I don't pull out my dentals\nI go sometimes I do in a dream\nWhen I am on the scene\nAnd the ghost come and make me scream\nIt's like you are doing the most\nAnd I gotta fuckin' boast\nShout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast\nThat is some shit if you take a gander\nThat was said by Mr. Ned Flanders\nMr. Homer Simpson\nI'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on\nThey're like \u201cWatsky, I'll do everything for you\nI'll white knight for you and your fucking crew\u201d\nI'm like \u201cDude, don't be a simp\nActually, DO be a simp\nYou could be pimp\nYou could be wimp\nYou could fucking walk with a limp\nYou can have a crimp in your dimp-le\u201d\nI just get the whole tent pole\nUp in the sky cause I meant\nLots of people can come in\nCause I got a big tent\nSo if you are a lame\nFucking get bent\nAnd by lame, what I mean in this game\nIs the type of person who says that you're lame\nIs the type of person who judges\nIs the type of person who never budges\nWhen they get stubborn\nCause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard\n[?] 00:18:04\nWord!\nI think I got this whole thing turn-ed up\nBut that is bound to happen\n34 hours when you keep on rappin'\nSome words are going to collide like trains\nComing head to head, but it remains\nTo be seen that I get back on the track\nWith the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*\nWith my fucking clapping gums\nSo don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb\nSometimes\nCause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes\nBut it happens and I think that is the lesson\nThat you cannot achieve perfection\nAnd it's not even a worthy goal\nYou just gotta try to put that ball in the hole\nMore times than not\nThis is why I'm hot, as I said\nBut, you know Man's Not Hot?\nAlthough the truth is, I kinda fuckin' am\n'Cause I'm goin' kinda fuckin' ham\nOn the microphone-o oh no\nCan't believe he's like Apollo Anton Ohno\nIce skatin' all over the beat\nMakin' it repeat\nI do not want to beat my meat, on the camera\nThat would be a bad fuckin' PR move\nWhen I'm all up in the groove with my meat out\nThey would be like \"oh, shout out\nThat will ruin my career\nIs that fuckin' clear?\nShowin' his whole rear?\nHe got fuckin' nakey\nMake me, take me\nYou cannot bake me\nIn my EZ bake oven\nNo Sara Lee\nI just keep on flowing, so merrily\nVerily, forsooth, did he do that shit\nOh shit, man he's in the booth dropping it\nHe's just Frank Coppin it\nAnd there is no halting' it\nI just put some fuckin malt in it\nMake it like some Yoo-hoo\nYoo-hoo!\nDid you fuckin' boo hoo when I rhymed\n[00:20:00]\n'Cause you could not rhyme\nLike I do, do the crime and you know that I'm\nJust puttin' lime on top of this shit\nAnd that's lyme with the L-Y-M-E, envy me\n'Cause you know when I put it on top\nThat I am going to make it drop\nTo the bottom of the urinal\nYou're all in my brain\nAnd I'm hearing y'all\nBut I'm not 'cause I'm not seeing comments\nI be too scared to see the tools\nBut I got to just remain bold\nAnd I've got to stay in the hold\nMy whole nuts life, oh, my nuts\nRemember that shit? Remember Gobble Guts?\nRemember jungle?\n[00:20:41]\n\n[00:30:00]\nThey got lots of range, they fuckin' levitate\nVerbally, vocally, stoking the fire\nOf the couress I retired\nI feel one year\n'Cause when my nuts dropped I did not know clear\nSee how I could sing, that took many years\nBefore I try to do with the din\nAnd now I only rapped\nAnd now I only try to cap, no cap\nI just try to get that back\nThat back, uh, back\nAnd I'm gone\nOver the fence\nNo shout out to my pens\n\nYou know that goth is a dude who's friends with Lynn Maranda\n\n[00:40:00]\nI'm sittin' on the veranda\nJust sippin'

Migos ft. Drake \"Versace\"In June, Drake randomly released 4 songs at one time: his and J. Cole\u2019s \u201cJodeci Freestyle\", PARTYNEXTDOOR\u2019s \u201cOver Here\u201d, \u201cThe Motion\" with Sampha, and this banger by Atlanta rap trio Migos. This was the song that put Migos on the map, allowing them to have excellent promotion for their Y.R.N. mixtape. The track is one of Rap Genius\u2019 30 most viewed songs, coming in with 1.8 million views.99. BIG KRIT \"REM\"98. Lupe Fiasco \"Peace of paper/Cup of JAYZUS\"97. Joey Badass \"#Longlivesteelo\"96. Meek Mill \"Lil Nigga Snupe\"95. Logic \"Nasty\"Produced by DJ Don Cannon, this wordplay-heavy track puts Logic on display for all to see. None can ignore Def Jam\u2019s latest signee; the double entendres are abundant and the flow hits code red. Serving as his first single of the year proved to be a successful venture, gaining tens of thousands of views on Rap Genius and creating a platform for his Young Sinatra: Welcome To Forever mixtape.94. Isaiah Rashad ft. SZA \"Ronnie Drake\" 93. Kid Cudi ft. King Chip & ASAP Rocky \"Brothers\"92. Lupe Fiasco \"Animal Pharm\"91. French Montana \"Ain't Worried About Nothin'\"90. Mellow High ft. Domo Genesis \"Yu\" Domo Genesis constructs a catchy hook to bounce over Left Brain\u2019s keyboard heavy production. The Odd Future duo of Domo and Hodgy Beats lay down dope bars with their usual uncensored subject matter of drugs, bitches and wolves!89. Mike WiLL Made It  ft. Miley Cyrus, Wiz Khalifa, & Juicy J \"23\"88. Action Bronson \"Strictly For My Jeeps\"87. Rapsody ft. Chance the Rapper \"Lonely Thoughts\"86. Ab Soul ft. Mac Miller \"The End Is Near\"85. DJ Khaled ft. Drake, Rick Ross, & Lil Wayne \"No New Friends\"\u201cNo New Friends\u201d was the first single off DJ Khaled's Suffering From Success album. Produced by Noah \"40\" Shebib, the track features the usual suspects: Drake, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne. A behind-the-scenes photo from this song's video shoot led to the ultra-famous \u2018Drake Lean\u2019 meme, one of the biggest memes of 2013! With an enthralling beat and a memorable hook, \u201cNo New Friends\u201d was one of the most anthemic tracks of the year.84. Danny Brown ft. A$AP Rocky \"Kush Coma\"83. Rick Ross ft. Future \"No Games\"82. Flatbush Zombies \"MRAZ\"81. Wale ft. Sam Dew \"Love/Hate Thing\"80. Vic Mensa \"Lovely Day\"\u201cLovely Day\u201d is just one of those songs that makes you want to get up and dance, because it\u2019s so upbeat and fun! Vic lays down some dope bars, with metaphors that carry across multiple lines, a reference to Lupe\u2019s \u201cDaydreamin\u2019\u201d, and a shoutout to his best friend, what\u2019s not to love about this track?79. Meek Mill \"Levels\"78. Run The Jewels \"A Christmas Fucking Miracle\"77. Lil Wayne ft. Drake & Future \"Love Me\"76. Danny Brown ft. Freddie Gibbs \"The Return\"75. 2 Chainz \"Used 2\"This rare 2 Chainz solo joint has banging drums, an infectious hook, and a great club vibe. Produced by Mannie Fresh, the cut from B.O.A.T.S ll #METIME sees Tity Boi travel from Cali to New Orleans in the space of 2 bars, party the night away, and encourage more twerking. What isn\u2019t there to like?74. Lil Wayne ft. 2 Chainz \"Rich As Fuck\"73. Vic Mensa ft. Ab-Soul \"Holy, Holy\"72. Tech N9ne ft. Serj Tankian \"Straight Out The Gate\"71. ASAP Nast ft. Method Man \"Trillmatic\"70. Kid Cudi \"Immortal\"In an extremely personal \u201dImmortal\u201d, Cudi details his inner struggles. Arguably the best song from Indicud, this track saw Cudi handle all duties, production included. The drums hit hard, the harmonizing is uplifting and the strings melt your ears. Even an Adam Sandler sample made its way into the joint!69. Tyler, the Creator \"48\"68. Lil Wayne ft. Chance The Rapper \"You Song\"67. Jhene Aiko ft. Childish Gambino \"Bed Peace\"66. TI ft. B.o.B & Kendrick Lamar \"Memories Back Then\"65. Mac Miller ft. Schoolboy Q \"Gees\"This playful track is about nothing at all, so who better to kill it than Q and Mac? Mac lays down a characteristically hilarious hook and switches flows and voices as the bouncy beat from Chuck Inglish changes up. Q does his high-energy Q thing and blesses us with a nice \"FIGG SIDEEEEEEEE\" to wrap it all up.64. Lil B \"I Love You\"63. Danny Brown ft. Purity Ring \"25 Bucks\"62. Schoolboy Q \"Yay Yay\"61. Wale ft. Tiara Thomas \"Bad\"60. Lupe Fiasco \"SLR 2\"The fan requested \u201cControl\u201d response brought out Super Lupe for the second time and he was none too happy with the game. He called out multiple rappers while seamlessly changing flows and displaying classic Lupe lyricism. Oh yeah, and he made the song in just two hours!59. Mac Miller \"Objects In The Mirror\"58. Earl Sweatshirt ft. Tyler, the Creator \"Whoa\"57. Childish Gambino ft. Chance the Rapper \"Worst Guys\"56. 2 Chainz ft. Pharrell \"Feds Watching\"55. Rich Homie Quan \"Type Of Way\"One hit wonder or talented hit maker? That\u2019s the question posed by Rich Homie Quan with his street anthem \u201cType of Way\". The song propelled the relatively unknown Atlanta native into the spotlight and a top 50 spot on Billboards Hot 100 after it was caught up by the streets and shared around the Internet - even Michigan State\u2019s college football team is using it as their team anthem!54. Vic Mensa \"Orange Soda\"53. Ace Hood \"Bugatti\" ft. Future & Rick Ross52. Run The Jewels \"Banana Clipper\"51. YG \"My Nigga\"50. Joey Bada$$ \u201cUnorthodox\u201dJoey & Primo take it back to the golden age on this boom bap-esque joint. The minimalist production fits Joey\u2019s flow perfectly and enables his complex delivery and dope bars to shine. Functioning as the first single from \u201cSummer Knights\u201d, Joey drops some surprises; explaining his reasoning behind not signing a major record deal and that he does verses for free!49. Rocko \u201cU.O.E.N.O (Black Hippy Remix)\u201d ft. Ab Soul, Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar & Schoolboy Q48. Tyler, the Creator \u201cAnswer\u201d47. Joey Badass \u201c'95 'Till Infinity\u201d46. Hopsin \u201cHop Is Back\u201d45. Isaiah Rashad \u201cShot U Down (Remix)\u201d ft. Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q\u201dTDE newcomer Isaiah Rashad\u2019s best offering of 2013 came with this infectious hook laden remix of his original \u201cI Shot U Down\u201d. Featuring fellow TDE spitters Jay Rock & Schoolboy Q, the hard drums and longer verses propel the track to new heights. If it\u2019s anything to go by, we could be looking at a future addition to the Black Hippy quartet.44. Childish Gambino \u201cSweatpants\u201d43. Tech N9ne \u201cFragile\u201d ft. Kendrick Lamar, Kendall Morgan & \u00a1MAYDAY! 42. Mac Miller \u201cRed Dot Music\u201d ft. Action Bronson41. Jay Z \u201cOceans\u201d ft. Frank Ocean40. J Cole \u201cForbidden Fruit\u201d ft. Kendrick LamarAnother collaboration between good friends J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar led to one of the top singles off of Cole's album \"Born Sinner\". While Kendrick does not deliver a verse on it, the hook he gives us still is soothing and paints the religious theme throughout the song. Cole delivers two solid verses, talking about religion, his inner struggle, and even saying why he dropped his album the same day as Kanye West. One more from Lil Cole!39. Pusha T \u201cHold On\u201d ft. Rick Ross38. Schoolboy Q \u201cMan Of The Year\u201d37. Earl Sweatshirt \u201cSunday\u201d ft. Frank Ocean36. Jay Z \u201cFuckwithmeyouknowIgotit\u201d ft. Rick Ross35. Tyler, the Creator \u201cIFHY\u201d ft. Pharrell WilliamsThis is truly Tyler at his finest. From his beat to his bars, this track showcases Tyler\u2019s supreme artistic talent. Oh, and there\u2019s THAT VIDEO! The talk-rap, slow flow is personal and poetic. He combines crooning with curses effortlessly and elevates the track in doing so. The beat builds like a film. He even directed his idol Pharrell\u2019s angelic voice on the bridge, with a melody Tyler created himself. Sonically this track was standout, and then he made that video and this became undeniably next-level. 34. Jay Z \u201cTom Ford\u201d33. J Cole \u201cCrooked Smile\u201d ft. TLC32. Kendrick Lamar \u201cBitch Don't Kill My Vibe Remix\u201d ft. Jay Z31. Chance The Rapper \u201cAcid Rain\u201d 30. Childish Gambino \u201cTelegraph Ave (Oakland)\u201dPerhaps the universal favorite from the album, this is a dark, entrancing look at the compulsive and haunting power of our past loves/infatuations. Like The Boy driving down Telegraph Ave, we can spend our time retreading the same roads thinking about \u201cwhat ifs\u201d and reminiscing about things lost \u2013 sometimes alongside the people with whom we lost them. But unless we decide to do something about all those lost things \u2013 whether to try again, or to walk away for good \u2013 all that wandering isn\u2019t going to do us any good. Using Lloyd\u2019s \u201cOakland\u201d literally in the song, Gambino cleverly plays both rapper and listener creating and experiencing the track with us.29. Tyler, the Creator \u201cRusty\u201d ft. Domo Genesis & Earl Sweatshirt28. Chance The Rapper \u201cFavorite Song\u201d ft. Childish Gambino27. A$AP Ferg \u201cWork (Remix)\u201d ft. A$AP Rocky, French Montana, SchoolBoy Q & Trinidad James26. Pusha T \u201cKing Push\u201d 25. Chance The Rapper \u201cJuice\u201dThe first single off Acid Rap, Juice was one of the big breakthroughs this year for Chance. The first thing that catches your ears is Chance\u2019s sing-songy, cartoony flow which you can\u2019t help singing along to (some jumping around is mandatory). But listen closely, and you get Chancelor\u2019s dope bars: dense, great-sounding internal rhymes and clever Chicago references. As you\u2019re headbanging through the verse though, you\u2019re hit with that absolutely HYPE chorus that is guaranteed to make you lose your shit. What you\u2019re left with is one of the catchiest, most memorable songs of 2013 and a high point in the spectacular year Chance has had.24. Drake \u201cHold On We're Going Home\u201d ft. Majid Jordan23. A$AP Ferg \u201cShabba\u201d ft. A$AP Rocky22. J Cole \u201cLet Nas Down\u201d21. Eminem \u201cBerzerk\"20. Drake \u201cWorst Behavior\u201dThis Nothing Was The Same stand-out combines Drizzy\u2019s loud, arrogant hook with even more flexin\u2019 in his verses. DJ Dahi delivers with gritty, bass-heavy production deceptively containing no sample. Like many tracks on NWTS, Drake\u2019s flow and the beat changes up across the song -- he even confidently borrows flow and bars from Ma$e\u2019s \u201cMo Money Mo Problems\u201d anthem. The music video stars his actual dad and uncles and contains his worst skit to date. Even with lyrics that playfully reference his famous Hot 97 freestyle blunder and remind us of his Degrassi roots, Drake manages to make one of the hardest bangers of 2013. Just accept that you\u2019ll never get the timing right for that initial \u201c.......WORST!\u201d19. Earl Sweatshirt \u201cHive\u201d ft. Vince Staples & Casey VeggiesThe leaps and bounds of growth that Earl Sweatshirt has experienced over the last several years can really be heard on Doris' standout track, \u201cHive.\u201d Fueled by a bassline that gives the song that dark, Odd Future feel, Earl spits much more mature bars using his now polished signature flow. With the addition of a great hook from young Casey Veggies, the song was already fantastic. But then Vince Staples busts in with a ski mask and absolutely kills it. Did Vince renegade Earl? That's up for debate, but you can't deny that Shyne, and everyone else on the song, absolutely did their thing.18. Eminem \u201cLove Game\u201d ft. Kendrick LamarWhen the MMLP2 tracklist was revealed, Love Game was one of the most heavily-anticipated tracks; everyone was envisioning a Renegade-level back-and-forth between Em and Kendrick. But the song turned out to be as left-field as possible. Backed by a quirky Rick Rubin-produced instrumental that could\u2019ve come straight from the \u201850s (cheesy sample included), Eminem describes his time with an unfaithful woman in hilarious detail, while Kendrick emulates Em\u2019s flow and raps about his experiences with the infamous Sherane. Although a largely comical song, Love Game still has a lot of great rhymes, with an especially phenomenal third verse by Em. Despite their bad experiences with women, Marshall and K.Dot let us know that they\u2019re always going to be playing the game of love!17. Drake \u201cStarted From The Bottom\u201d\u201cStarted From The Bottom\u201d, produced by Mike Zombie, was the first single off Drake's Nothing Was The Same album. The track was released in February and peaked at #6 on the US Billboard Hot 100. It has since been certified 2x Platinum. Some may doubt if Drake really did \u2018start at the bottom\u2019, but with 2.2 million pageviews on Rap Genius and one of the catchiest hooks of the year, there is no doubt that this track was one of the biggest anthems of 2013.16. Childish Gambino \u201c3005\u201dThe lead single for Because the Internet is quintessential Childish Gambino, but is also a great showcase for the artist\u2019s development over the last two years. It\u2019s a good sampling of the album\u2019s overall sound and texture. Gambino paints a great picture of how, if you don\u2019t have someone you really care about beside you, you can be completely alone in a crowded room, to say nothing of dealing with the rest of the shit life throws at you. He both raps and sings exceptionally well and effortlessly here. Gambino also gave us a pleasantly metaphorical video to accompany the song and make us think even more.15. Chance The Rapper \u201cCocoa Butter Kisses\u201d ft. Vic Mensa & TwistaTwo generations of Chicago hip-hop converge on this mixtape cut, with one artist already garnering national attention introducing another to the scene and re-introducing an OG from his city. Vic steals the show with an urgent and unforgiving verse, and Chance happily cedes the spotlight to him, restraining himself to an unassumingly spry and sing-songy verse; Twista, on the other hand, is not quite so willing to take a back seat, successfuly lacing the track with his trademark double-time bars. But amidst the aggressively fast raps of the trio, the hook has a contrastingly soothing melody that rounds out the entire production. This track firmly announces that hip-hop is once again Chicagoan.14. Jay Z \u201cHoly Grail\u201d ft. Justin TimberlakeIn a year of nervy choices that made business headlines around the world, Jay Z's boldest decision was actually a musical one. The only voice you hear during the first 1:19 of his new album's leadoff track is not Hov, but rather Justin Timberlake. This only manages to build anticipation, so that we are well-primed for the rapper's entry.And what an entry it is. His daughter's name is literally the first word out of his mouth, and with good reason. A post-fatherhood Jay is contemplative about the ups and downs of a personified fame, while admitting ultimately that he can't leave it alone. And lest we think he's lost a step, his patented wordplay is in full effect, with a pun on \"pigeons\" that puts today's coke-rappers to shame.13. ASAP Rocky \u201c1 Train\u201d ft. Kendrick Lamar, Joey Badass, Yelawolf, Danny Brown, Action Bronson and Big K.R.I.T.\"1 Train\" is the cypher to end all cyphers. A$AP Rocky amalgamated a line-up without a single weak spitter, and they all did their worst to this Hit-Boy produced banger. It's impossible to pick who delivered the best verse here: was it the energized Danny Brown? the lovable braggart Action Bronson? the wordsmith Joey Bad? the hard-driving Big K.R.I.T.? Someone else? I can't decide, but I do know this: the track is flames12. Schoolboy Q \u201cCollard Greens\u201d Kendrick LamarA cut between two of Top Dawg Entertainment's main artists, Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar came in to make a party banger just in time for summer. Schoolboy Q delivers a solid verse about his favorite things, (and how other people can't have them), before Kendrick comes in with that Espa\u00f1ol that makes this verse so memorable. The hook might be a little random, but the vibe it generates makes it infectious upon first listen.11. Kanye West \u201c Black Skinhead\u201dWhen word dropped that Daft Punk would be working with Kanye West on his new album, it was fair to assume it would result in a genre-blending song like Stronger. What we ended up with was indeed a blend of genres, but instead of electronic synths and filtered vocals, we got primal screams and distorted 808\u2019s. Kanye is pissed off, but not the kind of pissed he gets about croissants or Jimmy Kimmel. No, Ye is fed up with people questioning his choices and he\u2019s frustrated that nobody is taking risks anymore. And it\u2019s palpable in this song, which represents the rebellious, IDGAF attitude that flows from both Kanye and Yeezus. Using few else but drums and vocal sounds you\u2019d more likely hear exploring the Amazon than in Hip Hop, Kanye crafts an uneasy, raw instrumental that pairs perfectly with his blunt lyrics10. J Cole \u201cPower Trip\u201d ft. MiguelIn classic J. Cole fashion, nearly everything on this track is done by himself. The smooth voice of Miguel helps out on a hook, but otherwise it is Cole\u2019s world. The incredibly catchy hooks match up perfectly with his production and he drops plenty of relatable bars about a crush. This continuation of his 2009 song \u201cDreams\u201d is about not only a girl, but also hip-hop and its impact on him - giving an already impressive song some duality. And much like the song sounds, its video felt like a short film as Cole literally does whatever it takes to claim his love. The 10th most viewed song on RG in 2013, fans spent a combined 7.5 years of time on this song page!09. Drake \u201cPound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2\u201d ft. Jay ZDrake crafts one of the most memorable tracks of 2013 with the outro to his third studio LP Nothing Was The Same. Boi-1da delivers on Pound Cake with a spacey Ellie Goulding sample as Drizzy paints the picture about what his life has been like while recording and making the album.The song isn\u2019t finished there by any means. After two Jay verses, Drake comes back in for Paris Morton Music 2 and a perfect verse to remind us this is his song. The extra long PMM 2 verse is also very personal, looking back on the landscape of  his career and perhaps how he\u2019s no longer the same08. Pusha T \u201cNumbers On The Boards\u201dMy Name Is My Name is a stark minimalist creation and with the \u201cNo Artwork\u201d cover, \u201cNumbers On The Boards\u201d is the centerpiece. Don Cannon & Kanye West create the spine with King Push on his super Lupe raps in between catchy samples. Push said all year he wanted to bring \u201cthat feeling back\u201d, and \u201cNumbers On The Boards\u201d knocks harder than him thumping the wall with his fist. The lyrically enthralling track is jam packed with references and double entendres that takes you to Pusha\u2019s dark underground hell in only a way he could.07. \u201cKanye West - Bound 2\u201d ft. Charlie Wilson\u201cBound 2\u201d was an unexpected but wholly welcome ending to Yeezus. The song has sparked wide discussion: is it a rejection of the past 37 minutes? Is it a reassurance to fans about Kanye\u2019s present musical identity? Is it a revelation about Kanye\u2019s future? Who really cares? Kanye fans who hated Yeezus loved it and Kanye fans who loved Yeezus loved it. \u201cBound 2\u201d is a weirdly endearing love song featuring classic Kanye flow floating over soul samples, topped with Charlie Wilson\u2019s magical voice. What\u2019s not to like?! Well, many would actually say \u201cthe video\u201d, which was an overtly cheesy, green-screened, steamy motorcycle ride that not only made the world cringe, but also felt like the furthest thing from Ye\u2019s aesthetic. But that was the point. Ye geniusly defied our expectations and used his prettiest song\u2019s video as a commentary on the \u201cwack\u201d quality of American art and media that he feels should be banned. How very, New Slaves of him.06. Eminem \u201cBad Guy\u201dSequels to much-loved properties are rarely a good idea. For every The Empire Strikes Back, there are three Matrix Reloadeds.  So when word leaked out that Em had recorded a follow-up to his epic 2000 story-song \u201cStan,\u201d fans were nervous.  After all, Stan died at the end, right? So what\u2019s left?Plenty, as it turns out.  Marshall turned a potentially bad idea into fantastic art with his imagining of Stan\u2019s little brother Matthew (with the autographed Starter cap), now all grown up and seeking revenge.  But just as the tale reaches its apex, the song switches perspective, revealing an intense look at Eminem\u2019s self-doubts and anguish. Just before the end, he drops the biggest gem of all: his in-song tormentors are \u201cjust symbolic/Of not knowing what you had \u2018til it\u2019s gone.\u201d  The rapper himself may not know, but trust us, Slim, we do.05. Pusha T \u201cNosetalgia\u201d ft. Kendrick LamarThis genre defining song starts with a dirty Nottz beat that makes you feel like committing a crime and quickly escalates to the feeling you\u2019re part of one. The KRS sample serves as the hook and sounds of scratches fill the airwaves. Kings Push & Kendrick come through with menacing delivery and complex wordplay. While Terrence is neck deep in dealing, Kendrick is in the midst of consumption - the contrast is phenomenal, both MC\u2019s affected by the crack epidemic in opposing instances. The insight into Kendrick\u2019s story is rare, the Compton native always let us ride around his house but never let us through the front door. \u201cNosetalgia\u201d is your 8ball on a Friday night, 4 shots of espresso every morning, and the In N Out double double you crave in LA. It\u2019s dope. 04. Kanye West \u201cBlood On The Leaves\u201dBlood On The Leaves introduces a new piece into the emotional puzzle of Yeezus: remorse. The song is drowning in so many feels, it\u2019s impossible not to catch some yourself. Kanye\u2019s autotuned story of sadness begins atop the somber piano of the beautifully chopped Strange Fruit sample, but then the blaring horns and bass of TNGHT\u2019s R U Ready burst through and all of a sudden that sadness turns to rage. By the end of it all you\u2019re left with a modern day power ballad with enough autotune and raw emotion to make Future blush. Blood On The Leaves got to a bit of a slow start on Rap Genius due to lack of exposure pre-album release, but thanks in part to Kanye\u2019s emotionally charged VMA performance the song is one of the most viewed Yeezus tracks on the site. The song\u2019s instrumental has also become one of Producer Genius\u2019 prized breakdowns, explaining the use of the song\u2019s controversial Nina Simone sample and the origin of that beat drop. Can you imagine if Yeezus started off with this song, like Kanye originally planned? The world would have imploded.03. Eminem \u201cRap God\u201d\u201dSix minutes, Slim Shady, you\u2019re on\u201d. After the novelty of a second Marshall Mathers LP began to wear off, Eminem got the buzz back by becoming the third MC this year to proclaim himself a god. This rapid-fire lyrical tour de force is laced with references to the first Mathers LP, sneak disses to some of his old buddies, and a 17 second stretch crammed with over 100 words. The Detroit native also broke Rap Genius the day \"Rap God\" was released, and has now amassed over 4 million page views\n\nProving himself in the booth was just the beginning for Slim. After criticism he lip synced on live television, Marshall Mathers showed up to the YouTube music awards and destroyed the hopes and dreams of every rapper alive when he performed the song live. It\u2019s safe to say \"Rap God\" proved the internal rhyme mastermind is back on his Pharoahe Monch grind and nothing\u2019s going to stop him.02. Big Sean \u201cControl\u201d ft. Kendrick Lamar & Jay ElectronicaYou all knew this was coming. Big Sean delivered a 3 minute dope verse to open the track. Comparing his rapping skill to a baby's first steps and reminiscing on his grandfather, he manages to give one of the best verses of his career. For obvious reasons, we'll skip to Jay Electronica next. He too spit a clean verse about religion, while sneaking in TV and car references, and even mentioning his late grandmother, much like Sean did.However, there was a 3rd feature to this monster track produced by No I.D. His name? King Kendrick Lamar. He came with one purpose: to assassinate the competition. The lyrical warfare was on for all to see and was full of levels. The Compton MC proclaimed he was both 2Pac's offspring and the King of New York, causing mass hysteria in hip hop\u2019s homeland. But oh no, it wasn\u2019t over yet. His braggadocio left mouths agape as he goes on to say he is as popular as the Beatles and placed his name up for one of the greatest MC's of all time. And yet there was more...he called out every hot young rapper - by their name, a rarity in Hip Hop (no sneak disses here!). Basically Kendrick manages to piss off every rapper and revolutionize the rap game at the same damn time. How about it?01. Kanye West \u201cNew Slaves\u201d ft. Frank Ocean\"New Slaves\" is best described as an \u201copen letter\u201d from Kanye West to the people - made into music. Produced by the Very G.O.O.D Beats crew, New Slaves is sonically simplistic yet still possesses melody courtesy of the droning synths. Frank Ocean assists on the outro, providing an amazing contrast to the aggressive tone used throughout the song, acting in a reflective manner. However from a lyrical standpoint it\u2019s without a doubt one of Kanye\u2019s greatest songs. He labeled verse 2 as the \u201cbest verse of all time\u201d and with topics that range from modern day slavery to the fashion industry, and even America's prison system, it\u2019s hard to disagree\n\nThe Chi-town native doesn\u2019t just stop at the music. With a guerrilla marketing scheme fit for a military coup, Ye projected the track onto buildings in 66 locations across the world. It\u2019s been 8 months since the song\u2019s release and the significance of \u201dNew Slaves is only just surfacing. Between the time of the song\u2019s release and present day, the attitude of multiple industries has started to shift dramatically - would Jay Z and Beyonce have released projects with such unorthodox promotion methods if Kanye didn\u2019t do it first? His movement, spearheaded with this peoples anthem, was made to inspire others to think in a similar light. \u201dNew Slaves\u201d invokes the power of free speech and brandishing the truth like an axe, Kanye challenges listeners to think outside the MatrixJust as Mandela blew up the buildings and eventually became president. Contrary to popular opinion, sometimes you have to blow up the building.\u2014 Kanye West578Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/8176969", "artist_names": "SiriusXM", "full_title": "Top 1000 Country Songs of All Time (2022) by\u00a0SiriusXM", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.512x512x1.jpg", "id": 8176969, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 16851497, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1658536633, "path": "/Siriusxm-top-1000-country-songs-of-all-time-2022-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Siriusxm-top-1000-country-songs-of-all-time-2022-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2022, "month": 7, "day": 8}, "release_date_for_display": "July 8, 2022", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jul. 8, 2022", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.512x512x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 6888}, "title": "Top 1000 Country Songs of All Time (2022)", "title_with_featured": "Top 1000 Country Songs of All Time (2022)", "updated_by_human_at": 1658687357, "url": "https://genius.com/Siriusxm-top-1000-country-songs-of-all-time-2022-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/200944", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.512x512x1.jpg", "id": 200944, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.512x512x1.jpg", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "SiriusXM", "slug": "Siriusxm", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Siriusxm"}, "artist": "SiriusXM", "lyrics": "Top 1000 Country Songs of All Time (2022) Lyrics1000.

But is it good for books? LyricsAmazon is a global superstore, like Walmart. It\u2019s also a hardware manufacturer, like Apple, and a utility, like Con Edison, and a video distributor, like Netflix, and a book publisher, like Random House, and a production studio, like Paramount, and a literary magazine, like The Paris Review, and a grocery deliverer, like FreshDirect, and someday it might be a package service, like U.P.S. Its founder and chief executive, Jeff Bezos, also owns a major newspaper, the Washington Post. All these streams and tributaries make Amazon something radically new in the history of American business. Sam Walton wanted merely to be the world\u2019s biggest retailer. After Apple launched the iPod, Steve Jobs didn\u2019t sign up pop stars for recording contracts. A.T. & T. doesn\u2019t build transmission towers and rent them to smaller phone companies, the way Amazon Web Services provides server infrastructure for startups (not to mention the C.I.A.). Amazon\u2019s identity and goals are never clear and always fluid, which makes the company destabilizing and intimidating.\n\nBezos originally thought of calling his company Relentless.com\u2014that U.R.L. still takes you to Amazon\u2019s site\u2014before adopting the name of the world\u2019s largest river by volume. (If Bezos were a reader of classic American fiction, he might have hit upon Octopus.com.) Amazon\u2019s shape-shifting, engulfing quality, its tentacles extending in all directions, makes it unusual even in the tech industry, where rapid growth, not profitability, is the measure of success. Amazon is not just the \u201cEverything Store,\u201d to quote the title of Brad Stone\u2019s rich chronicle of Bezos and his company; it\u2019s more like the Everything. What remains constant is ambition, and the search for new things to be ambitious about.\n\nIt seems preposterous now, but Amazon began as a bookstore. In 1994, at the age of thirty, Bezos, a Princeton graduate, quit his job at a Manhattan hedge fund and moved to Seattle to found a company that could ride the exponential growth of the early commercial Internet. (Bezos calculated that, in 1993, usage climbed by two hundred and thirty thousand per cent.) His wife, MacKenzie, is a novelist who studied under Toni Morrison at Princeton; according to Stone, Bezos\u2019s favorite novel is Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s \u201cThe Remains of the Day,\u201d which is on the suggested reading list for Amazon executives. All the other titles, including \u201cSam Walton, Made in America: My Story,\u201d are business books, and even Ishiguro\u2019s novel\u2014about a self-erasing English butler who realizes that he has missed his chance at happiness in love\u2014offers what Bezos calls a \u201cregret-minimization framework\u201d: how not to end up like the butler. Bezos is, above all things, pragmatic. (He declined to be interviewed for this article.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a love of books that led him to start an online bookstore. \u201cIt was totally based on the property of books as a product,\u201d Shel Kaphan, Bezos\u2019s former deputy, says. Books are easy to ship and hard to break, and there was a major distribution warehouse in Oregon. Crucially, there are far too many books, in and out of print, to sell even a fraction of them at a physical store. The vast selection made possible by the Internet gave Amazon its initial advantage, and a wedge into selling everything else. For Bezos to have seen a bookstore as a means to world domination at the beginning of the Internet age, when there was already a crisis of confidence in the publishing world, in a country not known for its book-crazy public, was a stroke of business genius.\n\nIn 1995, in Chicago, Bezos manned an Amazon booth at the annual conclave of the publishing industry, which is now called BookExpo America. Roger Doeren, from a Kansas City store called Rainy Day Books, was stopped short by Amazon\u2019s sign: \u201cEarth\u2019s Biggest Bookstore.\u201d Approaching Bezos, he asked, \u201cWhere is Earth\u2019s biggest bookstore?\u201d\n\n\u201cCyberspace,\u201d Bezos replied.\n\u201cWe started a Web site last year. Who are your suppliers?\u201d\n\n\u201cIngram, and Baker & Taylor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOurs, too. What\u2019s your database?\u201d\n\n\u201c \u2018Books in Print.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cOurs, too. So what makes you Earth\u2019s biggest?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have the most affiliate links\u201d\u2014a form of online advertising.\n\nDoeren considered this, then asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your business model?\u201d\n\nBezos said that Amazon intended to sell books as a way of gathering data on affluent, educated shoppers. The books would be priced close to cost, in order to increase sales volume. After collecting data on millions of customers, Amazon could figure out how to sell everything else dirt cheap on the Internet. (Amazon says that its original business plan \u201ccontemplated only books.\u201d)\n\nAfterward, Doeren told his partner at Rainy Day Books, Vivien Jennings, \u201cI just met the world\u2019s biggest snake-oil salesman. It\u2019s going to be really bad for books.\u201d\n\nBefore Google, and long before Facebook, Bezos had realized that the greatest value of an online company lay in the consumer data it collected. Two decades later, Amazon sells a bewildering array of products: lawnmowers, iPods, art work, toys, diapers, dildos, shoes, bike racks, gun safes, 3-D printers. Amazon\u2019s code of corporate secrecy is extreme\u2014it won\u2019t confirm how many Seattle employees it has, or how many Kindle e-readers have been sold\u2014so it\u2019s impossible to know for sure, but, according to one publisher\u2019s estimate, book sales in the U.S. now make up no more than seven per cent of the company\u2019s roughly seventy-five billion dollars in annual revenue.\n\nOrigins, though, leave lasting marks, and Amazon remains intimately tangled up in books. Few notice if Amazon prices an electronics store out of business (except its staff); but, in the influential, self-conscious world of people who care about reading, Amazon\u2019s unparalleled power generates endless discussion, along with paranoia, resentment, confusion, and yearning. For its part, Amazon continues to expend considerable effort both to dominate this small, fragile market and to win the hearts and minds of readers. To many book professionals, Amazon is a ruthless predator. The company claims to want a more literate world\u2014and it came along when the book world was in distress, offering a vital new source of sales. But then it started asking a lot of personal questions, and it created dependency and harshly exploited its leverage; eventually, the book world realized that Amazon had its house keys and its bank-account number, and wondered if that had been the intention all along.\n\nRecently, Amazon even started creating its own \u201ccontent\u201d\u2014publishing books. The results have been decidedly mixed. A monopoly is dangerous because it concentrates so much economic power, but in the book business the prospect of a single owner of both the means of production and the modes of distribution is especially worrisome: it would give Amazon more control over the exchange of ideas than any company in U.S. history. Even in the iPhone age, books remain central to American intellectual life, and perhaps to democracy. And so the big question is not just whether Amazon is bad for the book industry; it\u2019s whether Amazon is bad for books.\n\nIn the nineteen-nineties, a different leviathan held publishers and independent bookstores in its grasp: chain stores, led by Barnes & Noble. When Amazon emerged, publishers in New York suddenly had a new buyer that paid quickly, sold their backlist as well as new titles, and, unlike traditional bookstores, made very few returns. Publishers must buy back unsold inventory from retailers, an archaic and costly practice that one ex-Amazon employee called \u201can absurdly inefficient model, worse than my uncle sending his laundry home from college.\u201d\nJohn Sargent, who is the chief executive of Macmillan, first met Bezos in the mid-nineties, at a hotel in Washington, D.C. \u201cHe was this incredibly energetic guy,\u201d Sargent said. \u201cI thought it was a really good idea.\u201d Jane Friedman, who was then an associate publisher at Knopf, and subsequently ran HarperCollins, said of Bezos, \u201cI was completely taken with him. He was a skinny kid, he was young, he was excitable, and he was completely serious about what he was doing. I drank the Kool-Aid.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s revenue multiplied every year. In the late nineties, an Amazon vice-president named Mary Morouse e-mailed her colleagues after a trip to visit publishers in New York. \u201cWe are certainly popular with them,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey rave about Amazon.com\u2014both as a store/service and a great way to market books. There were several examples cited where Amazon.com \u2018made\u2019 titles. And they love our sales numbers.\u201d\n\nPublishers weren\u2019t troubled that Amazon sold their books at dramatic discounts. They all wanted to collaborate with the Seattle upstart, and they used Amazon as an information resource; it was a vast improvement over the old green-bound copies of \u201cBooks in Print.\u201d A New York marketing executive told me, \u201cWhen Amazon came into the picture, metadata\u201d\u2014code numbers, Library of Congress categories, search keywords\u2014\u201cbecame an integral part of books.\u201d A few farsighted publishers wondered if Amazon would eventually control so much of the market that it would stop selling books at cost and raise prices to become more profitable.\n\nBy 1997, when the company went public, Amazon\u2019s book inventory could have filled six football fields. But someone who read Bezos\u2019s year-end letter to shareholders might well have thought that Amazon\u2019s eight-hundred-and-thirty-eight-per-cent sales growth had been in shoes, since he barely mentioned books. In the letter, Bezos noted tersely, \u201cWe are planning to add music to our product offering.\u201d (Unlike Jobs, Bezos wasn\u2019t a passionate listener: he once agreed to be interviewed for a program about the Beatles, and when employees, prepping the boss, asked him to name a favorite Beatles tune, Bezos chose \u201cAmerica,\u201d by Simon & Garfunkel.) Soon after music came DVDs and consumer electronics. A New York literary agent told me that books were Amazon\u2019s version of \u201ca gateway drug.\u201d\n\nSargent said that Bezos\u2019s ambition was apparent to him from the beginning\u2014\u201cMy God, he drives hard.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t see Bezos\u2019s master plan \u201cfor shit.\u201d \u201cHe was already going to be the Everything Store,\u201d Sargent said when we met in his trapezoidal office, in the narrow wedge of the Flatiron Building. \u201cI thought he was just a bookstore, stupid me. Books were going to be the way to get the names and the data. Books were his customer-acquisition strategy.\u201d As long as Amazon kept growing like mad, investors would pour in money and Wall Street wouldn\u2019t pay much attention to profits. (The company didn\u2019t have a profitable quarter until 2001, and still struggles to stay in the black.)\n\nIn the mid- to late nineties, Bezos hired two dozen writers and editors to produce copy for the Web site. One of them\u2014Amazon employee No. 55\u2014was a cultural critic from New York named James Marcus, who, in turn, brought in his friend Kerry Fried, who edited his pieces at the Village Voice. (She had also worked at several New York publishers and at The New York Review of Books.) For these refugees from New York, where jobs in publishing and journalism were already beginning to thin out, Amazon offered the thrill of working at a rising power, with stock options and an enormous audience.\n\nMarcus edited the home page, which was visited by at least thirty million people a day. Under the rubric \u201cBooks Favorites,\u201d he and his staff often promoted novels that needed a push to claim an audience, such as Myla Goldberg\u2019s \u201cBee Season.\u201d Marcus wrote hundreds of short book reviews and thousands of descriptive blurbs; Fried, who edited the Literature and Fiction section with Marcus, posted interviews with authors, including Penelope Fitzgerald and Stanley Kunitz. In 2004, Marcus, now the executive editor of Harper\u2019s, published a wry, bittersweet memoir of his experience, \u201cAmazonia.\u201d He told me, \u201cIt was useful to Amazon, as a business strategy, to convey the feeling of your beloved indie bookstore, full of hip, book-loving people.\u201d\n\nReaders, especially isolated ones, adored Amazon. \u201cWe heard from people all the time,\u201d Marcus said. \u201c \u2018I live in some Podunk town, the nearest bookstore is a hundred miles from my house, and now I can get the most obscure book.\u2019 \u201d Marcus asked Toni Morrison to do an interview. \u201cI\u2019m happy to talk,\u201d she told him. \u201cI hear you\u2019re selling more books than anyone in the history of the world.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cAmazonia,\u201d Marcus describes Bezos\u2019s \u201canticharismatic charisma, which would have mortified a Great Man of a century ago but seemed just right for our nerd-driven meritocracy.\u201d In those years, Bezos joined his staff for the round-the-clock work of \u201cpicking\u201d and shipping books at warehouses during the holiday season. One day in 1997, Fried went into the company kitchen and found him absorbed in assembling an ant farm. \u201cHe had a lot of curiosity,\u201d she said. \u201cI keep hearing about Jeff\u2019s temper, but I have to say I never witnessed it. He was really pleasant and fun.\u201d His ambition sometimes had an idealistic cast: he wanted Amazon to warehouse two copies of every book ever printed, an unrealized dream grandly called the Alexandria Project.\n\nAt Amazon, original writing wasn\u2019t even called \u201ccontent.\u201d It was known as \u201cverbiage,\u201d simplified to \u201cverbage.\u201d Amazon\u2019s writers and editors formed a counterculture that never fit easily in a company ruled by computer engineers and M.B.A.s, who valued data most and believed only in measurable truths. \u201cThe key to understanding Amazon is the hiring process,\u201d one former employee said. \u201cYou\u2019re not hired to do a particular job\u2014you\u2019re hired to be an Amazonian. Lots of managers had to take the Myers-Briggs personality tests. Eighty per cent of them came in two or three similar categories, and Bezos is the same: introverted, detail-oriented, engineer-type personality. Not musicians, designers, salesmen. The vast majority fall within the same personality type\u2014people who graduate at the top of their class at M.I.T. and have no idea what to say to a woman in a bar.\u201d\n\nThe humanists at Amazon brought a strain of intellectual irony that set them apart from the company\u2019s cult of relentlessness. Bezos closed annual reports to shareholders with an exhortation to experiment and to fight complacency: \u201cThis is still Day 1.\u201d Marcus and Fried joked about writing a novel that would begin, \u201cIt was Day 1. Again.\u201d (Amazon recently began publishing a literary magazine for its Kindle device: Day One.)\n\nOne important way that Bezos\u2019s writers and editors differed from the tech and business people was in their gentler attitude toward book publishers. Even when Amazon\u2019s entire business was in books, and its relations with publishers were fairly good, it nurtured a certain impatience with New York houses that supplied the products it sold. Mary Morouse\u2019s account of her trip east in 1999 reported, \u201cI had one S.V.P. of sales tell me, \u2018We like any account who is growing faster than we are, but we don\u2019t really forecast that way.\u2019 When I asked him how much they are growing, he said \u2018I don\u2019t know. I think we were flat last year.\u2019 That gives you some idea of the level of business focus.\u201d According to Marcus, Amazon executives considered publishing people \u201cantediluvian losers with rotary phones and inventory systems designed in 1968 and warehouses full of crap.\u201d Publishers kept no data on customers, making their bets on books a matter of instinct rather than metrics. They were full of inefficiences, starting with overpriced Manhattan offices. There was \u201ca general feeling that the New York publishing business was just this cloistered, Gilded Age antique just barely getting by in a sort of Colonial Williamsburg of commerce, but when Amazon waded into this they would show publishing how it was done.\u201d\n\nDuring the 1999 holiday season, Amazon tried publishing books, leasing the rights to a defunct imprint called Weathervane and putting out a few titles. \u201cThese were not incipient best-sellers,\u201d Marcus writes. \u201cThey were creatures from the black lagoon of the remainder table\u201d\u2014Christmas recipes and the like, selected with no apparent thought. Employees with publishing experience, like Fried, were not consulted. Weathervane fell into an oblivion so complete that there\u2019s no trace of it on the Internet. (Representatives at the company today claim never to have heard of it.) Nobody at Amazon seemed to absorb any lessons from the failure. A decade later, the company would try again.\nAmazon was a megastore, not an indie bookshop, let alone a literary review, and its writers were under pressure to prove that their work produced sales. If a customer clicked on a review or an interview, then left the page without making a purchase, it was logged as a Repel. Marcus was informed that his repulsion rate was too high. \u201cNobody ever felt safe,\u201d Fried said of her editorial colleagues. \u201cI took home my Rolodex every day.\u201d\n\nBook retailers, such as Barnes & Noble, negotiate \u201cco-op,\u201d or co\u00f6perative promotional fees, from publishers in exchange for prominent product placement. It\u2019s a way for a retailer to get a larger discount without violating the 1936 Robinson-Patman Act, which prohibits producers from offering price advantages to favored retailers. Although co-op fees weren\u2019t \u201cdreamed up by Amazon,\u201d Marcus told me, \u201cAmazon proved to be particularly good at squeezing this money out of publishers.\u201d Publishers paid ten thousand dollars for a book to be prominently featured on the home page. They never knew exactly how much these payments helped sales, and negotiations over them became tense. (In a statement, Amazon said, \u201cAs a general practice, we don\u2019t discuss our business negotiations with publishers.\u201d)\n\nEach category within Amazon\u2019s Books division had to collect co-op fees, and revenue targets rose steeply. In 1999, the company received $3,621,250 in co-op fees; the goal for 2000 was set at $9.25 million. When Marcus asked if publishers should be given sales targets in exchange for their payments, Lyn Blake, the executive who had created the co-op program, said no, adding, \u201cLook, it\u2019s the cost of doing business.\u201d The editorial staff was reminded that the money, unlike the receipts on sold books, went straight to Amazon\u2019s bottom line. Judgments about which books should be featured on the site were increasingly driven by promotional fees.\n\nAround this time, a group called the \u201cpersonalization team,\u201d or P13N, started to replace editorial suggestions for readers with algorithms that used customers\u2019 history to make recommendations for future purchases. At Amazon, \u201cpersonalization\u201d meant data analytics and statistical probability. Author interviews became less frequent, and in-house essays were subsumed by customer reviews, which cost the company nothing. Tim Appelo, the entertainment editor at the time, said, \u201cYou could be the Platonic ideal of the reviewer, and you would not beat even those rather crude early algorithms.\u201d Amazon\u2019s departments competed with one another almost as fiercely as they did with other companies. According to Brad Stone, a trash-talking sign was hung on a wall in the P13N office: \u201cpeople forget that john henry died in the end.\u201d Machines defeated human beings.\n\nIn December, 1999, at the height of the dot-com mania, Time named Bezos its Person of the Year. \u201cAmazon isn\u2019t about technology or even commerce,\u201d the breathless cover article announced. \u201cAmazon is, like every other site on the Web, a content play.\u201d Yet this was the moment, Marcus said, when \u201ccontent\u201d people were \u201con the way out.\u201d Although the writers and the editors made the site more interesting, and easier to navigate, they didn\u2019t bring more customers. One day, Fried discovered a memo, written by a programmer and accidentally left on a printer, which suggested eliminating the editorial department. Anne Hurley, the editor-in-chief of the DVD and Video section, was viewed dismissively by her boss, Jason Kilar, who went on to run the video-streaming company Hulu. He told her, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Anne, I just don\u2019t see what value you add.\u201d (Kilar denies saying this.)\n\nIn July, 2000, Bezos sent out a company-wide e-mail with the subject line \u201cSmile, remember it\u2019s Day 1, and let\u2019s kick some butt.\u201d Several months earlier, the bubble had burst, and Amazon\u2019s overcapitalized share price was plunging. For the first time, Wall Street lost faith in the company, and Bezos announced that the next eighteen months would be devoted to making \u201cserious profits.\u201d Marcus and Fried quit before they could be laid off. Tim Appelo took Marcus\u2019s place. \u201cI was the last human editor of the home page,\u201d he told me. \u201cBy the time I got there, it was only partly human.\u201d By 2002, the home page was fully automated. (Today, eight editors select titles to be featured on the Books page, and if you scour the site you can find a books blog, Omnivoracious, but its offerings seem marginal to the retail enterprise.) Editorial content had served its purpose, just as selling books had served its purpose, and Amazon\u2019s conquistadores galloped onward.\n\nThe fact that Amazon once devoted significant space on its site to editorial judgments\u2014to thinking and writing\u2014would be an obscure footnote if not for certain turns in the company\u2019s more recent history. According to one insider, around 2008\u2014when the company was selling far more than books, and was making twenty billion dollars a year in revenue, more than the combined sales of all other American bookstores\u2014Amazon began thinking of content as central to its business. Authors started to be considered among the company\u2019s most important customers. By then, Amazon had lost much of the market in selling music and videos to Apple and Netflix, and its relations with publishers were deteriorating. These difficulties offended Bezos\u2019s ideal of \u201cseamless\u201d commerce. \u201cThe company despises friction in the marketplace,\u201d the Amazon insider said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for us to sell books and make books happen if we do it our way and not deal with others. It\u2019s a tech-industry thing: \u2018We think we can do it better.\u2019 \u201d If you could control the content, you controlled everything.\n\nMany publishers had come to regard Amazon as a heavy in khakis and oxford shirts. In its drive for profitability, Amazon did not raise retail prices; it simply squeezed its suppliers harder, much as Walmart had done with manufacturers. Amazon demanded ever-larger co-op fees and better shipping terms; publishers knew that they would stop being favored by the site\u2019s recommendation algorithms if they didn\u2019t comply. Eventually, they all did. (Few customers realize that the results generated by Amazon\u2019s search engine are partly determined by promotional fees.) Sales meetings in Seattle were now all about payments, not new books, and the size of orders was predicated on algorithms, rather than on the enthusiasm of the publishers\u2019 sales staff and Amazon\u2019s own buyers, who were rebranded as \u201cinventory managers.\u201d Brad Stone describes one campaign to pressure the most vulnerable publishers for better terms: internally, it was known as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested \u201cthat Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle.\u201d (Company lawyers later changed the name to the Small Publisher Negotiation Program.)\n\n\u201cThe Gazelle Project\u2014that was me,\u201d Dennis Johnson, a co-owner of Melville House, a small publisher with offices on the Brooklyn waterfront, said. Melville House puts out quality fiction and nonfiction, including \u201cDebt: The First 5,000 Years,\u201d by the anarchist anthropologist David Graeber; \u201cThe Flight of the Intellectuals,\u201d by Paul Berman; and translations of the German novelist Hans Fallada. In 2004, when Melville House was just getting started, Johnson\u2019s distributor called him and described his negotiations with Amazon as being \u201clike dinner with the Godfather.\u201d Amazon wanted a payment without having to reveal how many Melville House books were sold on the site. (Amazon rarely makes its sales figures public, using bar graphs without numbers in presentations.) \u201c \u2018Fuck you\u2019 was my attitude,\u201d Johnson said. \u201c \u2018They\u2019re bluffing\u2014I\u2019m going to call their bluff.\u2019 I\u2019m a working-class kid. I come at this from \u2018This is my company, you don\u2019t come in here.\u2019 \u201d Johnson, who remains one of the few people in publishing willing to criticize Amazon on the record, contacted reporters, and Publishers Weekly ran a story. By the next day, the buy buttons had disappeared from Melville House\u2019s titles on Amazon.com. Not long afterward, the Book Expo was held at the Javits Center, in Manhattan. Two young men in suits approached Melville House\u2019s booth and pointed fingers at Johnson. \u201cWhen are you going to get with the program?\u201d they asked. The men were wearing Amazon nametags.\n\nBefore the impasse, Amazon had represented eight per cent of Melville House\u2019s sales, more than Johnson could afford to lose. So he capitulated. \u201cI paid that bribe\u201d\u2014he wouldn\u2019t disclose the amount\u2014\u201cand the books reappeared.\u201d\n\nThe process of paying co-op fees to promote individual titles grew increasingly complex, especially after Amazon began selling different levels of promotion. Without dropping co-op fees entirely, Amazon simplified its system: publishers were asked to hand over a percentage of their previous year\u2019s sales on the site, as \u201cmarketing development funds.\u201d Publishers dread the annual negotiation of this payoff; one of them described it as \u201csqueezing our nuts.\u201d The figure keeps rising, though less for the giant pachyderms than for the sickly gazelles. According to the marketing executive, the larger houses, which used to pay two or three per cent of their net sales through Amazon, now relinquish five to seven per cent of gross sales, pushing Amazon\u2019s percentage discount on books into the mid-fifties. Random House currently gives Amazon an effective discount of around fifty-three per cent.\n\nFor a smaller house, Amazon\u2019s total discount can go as high as sixty per cent, which cuts deeply into already slim profit margins. Because Amazon manages its inventory so well, it often buys books from small publishers with the understanding that it can\u2019t return them, for an even deeper discount. Publishers sometimes pass on this cost to authors, by redefining royalties as a percentage of the publisher\u2019s receipts, not of the book\u2019s list price. Recently, publishers say, Amazon began demanding an additional payment, amounting to approximately one per cent of net sales. Once the fee was paid, publishing executives could discuss marketing strategies with Amazon staff; otherwise, they\u2019d have to rely on the company\u2019s algorithms. \u201cThere really are rules in play,\u201d a former Amazon executive says. If a publisher resists when Amazon asks for a \u201cbump\u201d in payments, its books \u201ccan\u2019t be promoted.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, Amazon introduced Search Inside the Book, which allowed customers to hunt for a phrase in a book without having to buy it. Publishers warily allowed Amazon to scan some of their titles and convert the images into searchable text. They didn\u2019t realize that they were giving Amazon a huge head start over potential competitors when it decided to go into the digital-books business.\n\nIn the mid-aughts, Bezos, having watched Apple take over the music-selling business with iTunes and the iPod, became determined not to let the same thing happen with books. In 2004, he set up a lab in Silicon Valley that would build Amazon\u2019s first piece of consumer hardware: a device for reading digital books. According to Stone\u2019s book, Bezos told the executive running the project, \u201cProceed as if your goal is to put everyone selling physical books out of a job.\u201d Meanwhile, Amazon began pushing publishers to digitize and sign retail agreements on as many titles as possible. \u201cOur charter was to launch with a hundred thousand books and ninety per cent of the best-seller list,\u201d Jeff Steele, who worked on the project, said. (Steele left the company because he objected to Amazon\u2019s heavy-handed tactics with publishers.) In late 2007, at a press conference in New York, Bezos unveiled the Kindle, a simple, lightweight device that\u2014in a crucial improvement over previous e-readers\u2014could store as many as two hundred books, downloaded from Amazon\u2019s 3G network. Bezos announced that the price of best-sellers and new titles would be nine-ninety-nine, regardless of length or quality\u2014a figure that Bezos, inspired by Apple\u2019s sale of songs on iTunes for ninety-nine cents, basically pulled out of thin air. Amazon had carefully concealed the number from publishers. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to let that cat out of the bag,\u201d Steele said.\n\nThe price was below wholesale in some cases, and so low that it represented a serious threat to the market in twenty-six-dollar hardcovers. Bookstores that depended on hardcover sales\u2014from Barnes & Noble and Borders (which liquidated its business in 2011) to Rainy Day Books in Kansas City\u2014glimpsed their possible doom. If reading went entirely digital, what purpose would they serve? The next year, 2008, which brought the financial crisis, was disastrous for bookstores and publishers alike, with widespread layoffs.\n\nBy 2010, Amazon controlled ninety per cent of the market in digital books\u2014a dominance that almost no company, in any industry, could claim. Its prohibitively low prices warded off competition. The literary agent Andrew Wylie (whose firm represents me) says, \u201cWhat Bezos wants is to drag the retail price down as low as he can get it\u2014a dollar-ninety-nine, even ninety-nine cents. That\u2019s the Apple play\u2014\u2018What we want is traffic through our device, and we\u2019ll do anything to get there.\u2019 \u201d If customers grew used to paying just a few dollars for an e-book, how long before publishers would have to slash the cover price of all their titles?\n\nPublishers looked around for a competitor to Amazon, and they found one in Apple, which was getting ready to introduce the iPad, and the iBooks Store. Apple wanted a deal with each of the Big Six houses (Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin, Random House, and Simon & Schuster) that would allow the publishers to set the retail price of titles on iBooks, with Apple taking a thirty-per-cent commission on each sale. This was known as the \u201cagency model,\u201d and, in some ways, it offered the publishers a worse deal than selling wholesale to Amazon. But it gave publishers control over pricing and a way to challenge Amazon\u2019s grip on the market. Apple\u2019s terms included the provision that it could match the price of any rival, which induced the publishers to impose the agency model on all digital retailers, including Amazon.\n\nFive of the Big Six went along with Apple. (Random House was the holdout.) Most of the executives let Amazon know of the change by phone or e-mail, but John Sargent flew out to Seattle to meet with four Amazon executives, including Russ Grandinetti, the vice-president of Kindle content. In an e-mail to a friend, Sargent wrote, \u201cAm on my way out to Seattle to get my ass kicked by Amazon.\u201d\n\nSargent\u2019s gesture didn\u2019t seem to matter much to the Amazon executives, who were used to imposing their own terms. Seated at a table in a small conference room, Sargent said that Macmillan wanted to switch to the agency model for e-books, and that if Amazon refused Macmillan would withhold digital editions until seven months after print publication. The discussion was angry and brief. After twenty minutes, Grandinetti escorted Sargent out of the building. The next day, Amazon removed the buy buttons from Macmillan\u2019s print and digital titles on its site, only to restore them a week later, under heavy criticism. Amazon unwillingly accepted the agency model, and within a couple of months e-books were selling for as much as fourteen dollars and ninety-nine cents.\n\nAmazon filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. In April, 2012, the Justice Department sued Apple and the five publishers for conspiring to raise prices and restrain competition. Eventually, all the publishers settled with the government. (Macmillan was the last, after Sargent learned that potential damages could far exceed the equity value of the company.) Macmillan was obliged to pay twenty million dollars, and Penguin seventy-five million\u2014enormous sums in a business that has always struggled to maintain respectable profit margins.\n\nApple fought the charges, and the case went to trial last June. Grandinetti, Sargent, and others testified in the federal courthouse in lower Manhattan. As proof of collusion, the government presented evidence of e-mails, phone calls, and dinners among the Big Six publishers during their negotiations with Apple. Sargent and other executives acknowledged that they wanted higher prices for e-books, but they argued that the evidence showed them only to be competitors in an incestuous business, not conspirators. On July 10th, Judge Denise Cote ruled in the government\u2019s favor.\n\nApple, facing up to eight hundred and forty million dollars in damages, has appealed. As Apple and the publishers see it, the ruling ignored the context of the case: when the key events occurred, Amazon effectively had a monopoly in digital books and was selling them so cheaply that it resembled predatory pricing\u2014a barrier to entry for potential competitors. Since then, Amazon\u2019s share of the e-book market has dropped, levelling off at about sixty-five per cent, with the rest going largely to Apple and to Barnes & Noble, which sells the Nook e-reader. In other words, before the feds stepped in, the agency model introduced competition to the market. But the court\u2019s decision reflected a trend in legal thinking among liberals and conservatives alike, going back to the seventies, that looks at antitrust cases from the perspective of consumers, not producers: what matters is lowering prices, even if that goal comes at the expense of competition. Barry Lynn, a market-policy expert at the New America Foundation, said, \u201cIt\u2019s one of the main factors that\u2019s led to massive consolidation.\u201d Judge Cote\u2019s opinion described Amazon\u2019s business practices in glowing terms, and she argued, \u201cIf Apple is suggesting that Amazon was engaging in illegal, monopolistic practices, and that Apple\u2019s combination with the Publisher Defendants to deprive a monopolist of some of its market power is pro-competitive and healthy for our economy, it is wrong.\u201d\n\nThose were sweet words for a company that declares itself to be \u201cEarth\u2019s most customer-centric company.\u201d Even its bitterest critics reluctantly admit to using Amazon, unable to resist its unparalleled selection, price, and convenience. When Bezos talks about serving the customer, it\u2019s as if he were articulating his purpose in life. \u201cThe customer is almost theological,\u201d James Marcus said. \u201cAny sacrifice is suitable for the customer.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeff is trying to create a machine that assumes the shape of public demand,\u201d Tim Appelo, the former entertainment editor, said. \u201cHe resembles a very, very smart shmoo\u2014he only wants to serve, to make you happy.\u201d Appelo was referring to Al Capp\u2019s smiling blob of a cartoon character, which happily provides people with whatever they need: milk, eggs, butter, even its own tasty self. With Amazon\u2019s patented 1-Click shopping, which already knows your address and credit-card information, there\u2019s just you and the buy button; transactions are as quick and thoughtless as scratching an itch. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a masturbatory culture,\u201d the marketing executive said. If you pay seventy-nine dollars annually to become an Amazon Prime member, a box with the Amazon smile appears at your door two days after you click, with free shipping. Amazon\u2019s next frontier is same-day delivery: first in certain American cities, then throughout the U.S., then the world. In December, the company patented \u201canticipatory shipping,\u201d which will use your shopping data to put items that you don\u2019t yet know you want to buy, but will soon enough, on a truck or in a warehouse near you.\n\nUntil recently, even taxes were airbrushed away. For years, Amazon fought furiously against paying sales taxes in states where it had no warehouses (and even where it did). California and other states, under pressure from retailers complaining about Amazon\u2019s unfair advantage, passed online-sales-tax laws. Amazon, with fulfillment centers across the country, favors a national online-sales-tax policy, perhaps because smaller online rivals would find it overwhelming to navigate all the tax jurisdictions across the country.\n\nAt Amazon.com, all the irritation and wasted time of a shopping expedition are gone\u2014the search for a parking place, the surly floor clerk, the sold-out items, the perversely slow person ahead of you at checkout. You don\u2019t have to think about how much the cashier, with her wrist in a splint, makes per hour. The Internet\u2019s invisibility shields Amazon from some of the criticism directed at its archrival Walmart, with its all-too-human superstores. Online commerce allows even conscientious consumers to forget that other people are involved.\n\nAmazon employs or subcontracts tens of thousands of warehouse workers, with seasonal variation, often building its fulfillment centers in areas with high unemployment and low wages. Accounts from inside the centers describe the work of picking, boxing, and shipping books and dog food and beard trimmers as a high-tech version of the dehumanized factory floor satirized in Chaplin\u2019s \u201cModern Times.\u201d Pickers holding computerized handsets are perpetually timed and measured as they fast-walk up to eleven miles per shift around a million-square-foot warehouse, expected to collect orders in as little as thirty-three seconds. After watching footage taken by an undercover BBC reporter, a stress expert said, \u201cThe evidence shows increased risk of mental illness and physical illness.\u201d The company says that its warehouse jobs are \u201csimilar to jobs in many other industries.\u201d\n\nLast September, lawyers brought a class-action lawsuit against Amazon, on behalf of a warehouse worker in Pennsylvania named Neal Heimbach, for unpaid wages: employees at the fulfillment center outside Allentown must wait in line to pass through metal detectors, and submit their belongings to be searched, when they leave for lunch and at the end of their shift. The process takes ten to twenty minutes each time. Theft is a common concern in Amazon warehouses\u2014no doubt, a knock-on effect of the absence of bonds between the company and the ever-shifting roster of low-paid employees.\n\nNone of Amazon\u2019s U.S. workers belong to unions, because the customer would suffer. A company executive told the Times that Amazon considers unions to be obstacles that would impede its ability to improve customer service. In 2011, the Allentown Morning Call published an investigative series with accounts of multiple ambulances being parked outside a warehouse during a heat wave, in order to ferry overcome workers to emergency rooms. Afterward, Amazon installed air-conditioners, although their arrival coincided with the expansion of grocery services. In any case, Amazon\u2019s warehouse jobs are gradually being taken over by robots. Bezos recently predicted to a gobsmacked Charlie Rose that, in five years, packages will be delivered by small drones. Then Amazon will have eliminated the human factor from shopping, and we will finally be all alone with our purchases.\n\nThe combination of ceaseless innovation and low-wage drudgery makes Amazon the epitome of a successful New Economy company. It\u2019s hiring as fast as it can\u2014nearly thirty thousand employees last year. But its brand of creative destruction might be killing more jobs than it makes. According to a recent study of U.S. Census data by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, in Washington, brick-and-mortar retailers employ forty-seven people for every ten million dollars in revenue earned; Amazon employs fourteen.\n\nIn the book industry, many of those formerly employed people staffed independent stores. Two decades ago, there were some four thousand in America, and many of them functioned as cultural centers where people browsed and exchanged ideas. Today, there are fewer than two thousand\u2014although, with Borders dead and Barnes & Noble ailing, the indies are making a small comeback. Vivien Jennings, of Rainy Day Books, has been in business for thirty-eight years. \u201cWe know our customers, and the other independents are the same,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know what they read better than any recommendation engine.\u201d\n\nAfter Amazon\u2019s legal triumph, some publishing people were driven to the wild surmise that the company had colluded with the Justice Department, if not micromanaged the entire case. They grasped at the fact that Jamie Gorelick, a deputy attorney general in the Clinton Administration, and a friend of Attorney General Eric Holder, serves on Amazon\u2019s board, and that three weeks after Judge Cote\u2019s decision President Barack Obama appeared at an Amazon warehouse in Chattanooga\u2014where workers earn, on average, eleven dollars an hour\u2014to praise the company\u2019s creation of good jobs. The coup de gr\u00e2ce came last November, when the cash-strapped U.S. Postal Service announced a special partnership to deliver Amazon\u2014and only Amazon\u2014packages on Sundays, with the terms kept under official seal. To some people in the book world, Obama\u2019s embrace of their nemesis felt like a betrayal. One literary agent said, \u201cIt\u2019s strange that a President who\u2019s an author, and whose primary income has come from being an author, was siding with a monopoly that wants to undercut publishers.\u201d\n\nSince the arrival of the Kindle, the tension between Amazon and the publishers has become an open battle. The conflict reflects not only business antagonism amid technological change but a division between the two coasts, with different cultural styles and a philosophical disagreement about what techies call \u201cdisruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cBook publishing always has a rhetoric of the fallen age,\u201d a senior editor at a major house told me. \u201cIt was always better before you got here. The tech guys\u2014it\u2019s always better if you just get out of my way and give me what I want. It\u2019s always future-perfect.\u201d He went on, \u201cTheir whole thing is \u2018Let\u2019s take somebody\u2019s face and innovate on it. There\u2019s an old lady\u2014we don\u2019t know we\u2019re innovating unless she\u2019s screaming.\u2019 A lot of it is thoughtless innovation.\u201d\n\nThe senior editor, like most people in publishing, rarely deals directly with Amazon, but in the fall of 2010 he attended a meeting with Russ Grandinetti, the Kindle vice-president, who was visiting the big New York houses. Like Bezos, Grandinetti went to Princeton and worked on Wall Street. He joined Amazon in 1998, as treasurer, then moved on to apparel, before taking the Kindle job. An Amazon colleague described Grandinetti as the smartest guy in the room at a company where everyone believes himself to be just that. Many publishing types consider him a bully. The literary agent, who knows him, said, \u201cWhen you spend time with Russ, you get the sense that he thinks publishers are idiots.\u201d\n\nAt the meeting, Grandinetti displayed some of Amazon\u2019s number-free bar graphs and encouraged a faster move into digital publishing and online selling. \u201cHe gave this whole pitch,\u201d the senior editor said. \u201c \u2018It\u2019s proprietary, I can\u2019t show you, but everything that\u2019s good for us is good for you\u2014just do what we say.\u2019 \u201d\n\nGrandinetti took questions, and an editor raised his hand. \u201cI noticed you\u2019ve announced Kindle Singles\u201d\u2014digital works of fiction and nonfiction, sold for a few dollars, that are too long for most magazines but shorter than books. \u201cWhich publishers are you working with?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll publishers,\u201d Grandinetti said.\n\n\u201cAll publishers are participating in the Kindle Singles program?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, no. Amazon is the publisher.\u201d\n\nThe senior editor found it disturbing that Grandinetti couldn\u2019t even be straight about a piece of public information. It showed contempt for his audience. \u201cIt was very practiced in a way that publishing people don\u2019t do,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen I spoke with Grandinetti, he expressed sympathy for publishers faced with upheaval. \u201cThe move to people reading digitally and buying books digitally is the single biggest change that any of us in the book business will experience in our time,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause the change is particularly big in size, and because we happen to be a leader in making it, a lot of that fear gets projected onto us.\u201d Bezos also argues that Amazon\u2019s role is simply to usher in inevitable change. After giving \u201c60 Minutes\u201d a first glimpse of Amazon drone delivery, Bezos told Charlie Rose, \u201cAmazon is not happening to bookselling. The future is happening to bookselling.\u201d\n\nIn Grandinetti\u2019s view, the Kindle \u201chas helped the book business make a more orderly transition to a mixed print and digital world than perhaps any other medium.\u201d Compared with people who work in music, movies, and newspapers, he said, authors are well positioned to thrive. The old print world of scarcity\u2014with a limited number of publishers and editors selecting which manuscripts to publish, and a limited number of bookstores selecting which titles to carry\u2014is yielding to a world of digital abundance. Grandinetti told me that, in these new circumstances, a publisher\u2019s job \u201cis to build a megaphone.\u201d\n\nAfter the Kindle came out, the company established Amazon Publishing, which is now a profitable empire of digital works: in addition to Kindle Singles, it has mystery, thriller, romance, and Christian lines; it publishes translations and reprints; it has a self-service fan-fiction platform; and it offers an extremely popular self-publishing platform. Authors become Amazon partners, earning up to seventy per cent in royalties, as opposed to the fifteen per cent that authors typically make on hardcovers. Bezos touts the biggest successes, such as Theresa Ragan, whose self-published thrillers and romances have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times. But one survey found that half of all self-published authors make less than five hundred dollars a year.\n\nGrandinetti said that, because an unprecedented number of titles are available in an instant, \u201cit\u2019s never been a better time to be a reader.\u201d At last year\u2019s Frankfurt Book Fair, he warned publishers that they\u2019d keep those readers only if the price of e-books stayed low; otherwise, consumers would switch to playing Angry Birds on their tablets. He told me that the growth of online reader networks, such as GoodReads, which Amazon owns, is a welcome development: \u201cSuddenly, we\u2019re not locked into hearing the opinions of a small number of reviewers in newspapers.\u201d (Professional reviewers are fading out anyway, along with librarians and bookshop owners.) Listening to Grandinetti, I might have thought that Amazon\u2019s role in this transformation was that of a literary nonprofit that existed to make authors happy by delivering their books to as many readers as possible while keeping online gaming at bay\u2014that is, by being a shmoo for book people.\n\nAmazon has made it possible for hundreds of thousands of writers frustrated with the limits of traditional publishing to have their work read. David Blum, who edits Kindle Singles, cited a twenty-eight-thousand-word memoir, by a journalist named Oliver Broudy, about travelling with a collector of Gandhi memorabilia. It had been turned down by several magazines, but since Blum accepted it, in March, 2011, it has sold forty-five thousand units. More than five hundred Kindle Singles have appeared in less than three years\u2014three or four a week, making it hard for even an experienced editor like Blum to do much more than read and publish them.\n\nThe business term for all this clear-cutting is \u201cdisintermediation\u201d: the elimination of the \u201cgatekeepers,\u201d as Bezos calls the professionals who get in the customer\u2019s way. There\u2019s a populist inflection to Amazon\u2019s propaganda, an argument against \u00e9litist institutions and for \u201cthe democratization of the means of production\u201d\u2014a common line of thought in the West Coast tech world. Amazon executives speak of the \u201cRust Belt media,\u201d comparing book publishing to the steel industry in the seventies. \u201cEven well-meaning gatekeepers slow innovation,\u201d Bezos wrote in his 2011 letter to shareholders. \u201cWhen a platform is self-service, even the improbable ideas can get tried, because there\u2019s no expert gatekeeper ready to say \u2018that will never work!\u2019 \u201d Nevertheless, MacKenzie Bezos published her recent novel, \u201cTraps,\u201d with Knopf.\n\nIn May, 2011, Amazon announced that Laurence Kirshbaum, a longtime publisher of mass-market books and the former C.E.O. of Time Warner Books, would run a new trade division of Amazon Publishing, in New York. John Sargent sent Kirshbaum\u2014who was liked, if not widely respected, in the industry\u2014a terse e-mail: \u201cSay it ain\u2019t so.\u201d\n\nThe next day, they ran into each other at BookExpo, in the Javits Center. \u201cJohn, I love you,\u201d Kirshbaum said. \u201cBe happy for my success.\u201d\n\n\u201cLarry, let me be clear with you,\u201d Sargent said. \u201cI hope you fail.\u201d\n\nAmazon Publishing, which had been releasing mysteries and other genres in bulk, hoped that Kirshbaum would attract big-name authors and publish best-sellers. But top writers proved surprisingly loyal to their gatekeepers, and Amazon had to spend a lot of money on two dubious projects: a million dollars for \u201cThe 4-Hour Chef,\u201d by the self-help guru Timothy Ferriss, and eight hundred thousand dollars for \u201cMy Mother Was Nuts,\u201d a memoir by Penny Marshall, the \u201cLaverne & Shirley\u201d star. In hardcover, Ferriss\u2019s book has sold a fraction of the numbers of his two earlier self-help books; Marshall\u2019s has sold seventeen thousand. Nearly all of Amazon\u2019s other books have fared worse: \u201cActors Anonymous,\u201d a novel by James Franco, has sold fewer than five thousand. (Amazon claims to have sold many more copies of these titles as e-books.) In the past year, Amazon Publishing has barely been a presence at auctions, and several editors have departed; last month, Kirshbaum left the company, having failed at the task Amazon gave him. The new publisher, Daphne Durham, has spent her entire career at Amazon, and will remain in Seattle. Grandinetti, keeping his game face on, told me, \u201cAmazon Publishing is off to a very good start.\u201d\n\nThere was a practical reason for the failure. Hardcover copies were printed and distributed in a partnership with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, under an imprint called New Harvest, with Amazon\u2019s name missing from the spine. But bookstores weren\u2019t fooled. Barnes & Noble and nearly all the independents refused to stock its books\u2014why help their mortal enemy?\u2014and none of the titles gained enough momentum to force the stores to relent.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, in its hurry to show up New York publishers, Amazon didn\u2019t seem to know what it was doing. \u201cThere are certain things it takes to be a publisher,\u201d the head of one New York house said, hardly concealing his Schadenfreude. \u201cYou have to have luck, but you also have to have judgment, discernment. I have no sense of the character of their house. . . . We care more than they do. Bezos has moved on to diapers and jewelry\u2014we\u2019re still doing books.\u201d\n\nA former Amazon employee who worked in the Kindle division said that few of his colleagues in Seattle had a real interest in books: \u201cYou never heard people say, \u2018Hey, what are you reading?\u2019 Everyone there is so engineering-oriented. They don\u2019t know how to talk to novelists.\u201d The marketing executive pointed out that Amazon is a fast-moving company, but publishing is slow. \u201cIt\u2019s like the difference between trolling and fly-fishing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBook publishing is a very human business, and Amazon is driven by algorithms and scale,\u201d Sargent told me. When a house gets behind a new book, \u201cwell over two hundred people are pushing your book all over the place, handing it to people, talking about it. A mass of humans, all in one place, generating tremendous energy\u2014that\u2019s the magic potion of publishing. . . . That\u2019s pretty hard to replicate in Amazon\u2019s publishing world, where they have hundreds of thousands of titles.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s entry into publishing has created an awkward divide, giving some book people a second or a third chance in an imperilled industry while tainting them in the eyes of others. The literary agent, contemplating the future of the editors currently at Amazon, said, \u201cYou\u2019d have to consider the time you spent with Vichy when you\u2019re looking for work after the occupation.\u201d Benjamin Anastas, a novelist who couldn\u2019t find an American publisher for his third book, told a friend that he was going to publish his fourth, a memoir called \u201cToo Good to Be True,\u201d with Amazon. The friend, a novelist who had once worked at Harcourt\u2014the house that distributed Amazon\u2019s hardcover editions\u2014looked stricken. \u201cYou do that,\u201d she said, and walked away. Anastas found the reaction hypocritical. \u201cIf you\u2019re publishing with Penguin Random House, what\u2019s the difference?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re both these massive entities that have totally changed book publishing. There is nothing more demoralizing for a writer than to go into one of these huge towers to talk about your book amid all this product. You feel like a sperm-oil salesman at the Petroleum Club.\u201d Still, finding no copies of his new book in most stores was akin to watching himself disappear, and Anastas said that he would think twice before publishing with Amazon again.\n\nJon Fine, an intellectual-property lawyer, worked as Knopf\u2019s in-house counsel until Amazon hired him, in 2005. Since 2008, he\u2019s been the company\u2019s director of author-and-publisher relations\u2014\u201ctrying to get publishers to hate Amazon less,\u201d as an arts manager said. In March, 2009, Slate criticized Amazon for its miserly philanthropy, especially in the Seattle arts world, saying that certain lemonade stands were more generous. Fine showed the article around, and the next day a printed copy came back to him, with \u201cFix This\u201d scrawled across the page in Bezos\u2019s hand, and a budget of roughly a million dollars attached. (Amazon denies this.)\n\nEvery year, Fine distributes grants of twenty-five thousand dollars, on average, to dozens of hard-up literary organizations. Beneficiaries include the pen American Center, the Loft Literary Center, in Minneapolis, and the magazine Poets & Writers. \u201cFor Amazon, it\u2019s the cost of doing business, like criminal penalties for banks,\u201d the arts manager said, suggesting that the money keeps potential critics quiet. Like liberal Democrats taking Wall Street campaign contributions, the nonprofits don\u2019t advertise the grants. When the Best Translated Book Award received money from Amazon, Dennis Johnson, of Melville House, which had received the prize that year, announced that his firm would no longer compete for it. \u201cEvery translator in America wrote me saying I was a son of a bitch,\u201d Johnson said. A few nonprofit heads privately told him, \u201cI wanted to speak out, but I might have taken four thousand dollars from them, too.\u201d A year later, at the Associated Writing Programs conference, Fine shook Johnson\u2019s hand, saying, \u201cI just wanted to thank you\u2014that was the best publicity we could have had.\u201d (Fine denies this.)\n\nSerious publishing is in such a dire state that thoughtful people are defecting to Amazon. There\u2019s a line in Robert Stone\u2019s novel \u201cA Flag for Sunrise\u201d about \u201ca mouse so frightened it went to the cat for love.\u201d The cat can inspire inordinate gratitude when it lets the mouse live. \u201cI feel like, I get to do this!\u201d an editor who has joined Amazon said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2014I\u2019m still standing! I can\u2019t monitor other people\u2019s feelings, but I can\u2019t see what harm I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nBy producing its own original work, Amazon can sell more devices and sign up more Prime members\u2014a major source of revenue. While the company was building the Kindle, it started a digital store for streaming music and videos, and, around the same time it launched Amazon Publishing, it created Amazon Studios.\n\nThe division pursued an unusual way of producing television series, using its strength in data collection. Amazon invited writers to submit scripts on its Web site\u2014\u201can open platform for content creators,\u201d as Bill Carr, the vice-president for digital music and video, put it. Five thousand scripts poured in, and Amazon chose to develop fourteen into pilots. Last spring, Amazon put the pilots on its site, where customers could review them and answer a detailed questionnaire. (\u201cPlease rate the following aspects of this show: The humor, the characters . . . \u201d) More than a million customers watched. Engineers also developed software, called Amazon Storyteller, which scriptwriters can use to create a \u201cstoryboard animatic\u201d\u2014a cartoon rendition of a script\u2019s plot\u2014allowing pilots to be visualized without the expense of filming. The difficulty, according to Carr, is to \u201cget the right feedback and the right data, and, of the many, many data points that I can collect from customers, which ones can tell you, \u2018This is the one\u2019?\u201d\n\nLike the publishing venture, Amazon Studios set out to make the old \u201cgatekeepers\u201d\u2014in this case, Hollywood agents and executives\u2014obsolete. \u201cWe let the data drive what to put in front of customers,\u201d Carr told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cWe don\u2019t have tastemakers deciding what our customers should read, listen to, and watch.\u201d\n\nSteve Jobs once remarked that customers don\u2019t know what they want until Apple shows them. Amazon\u2019s view is nearly the opposite, which has made it the world\u2019s largest online store. But determining customers\u2019 desires by analyzing surveys and viewing patterns does not describe a path to artistic excellence.\n\nWhen Garry Trudeau, the creator of the \u201cDoonesbury\u201d comic strip, heard from his friend Jonathan Alter, the author and political journalist, that Amazon was interested in a script that Trudeau had written\u2014a comedy, \u201cAlpha House,\u201d about four Republican senators living together on Capitol Hill\u2014he was dubious: \u201cAmazon is a studio?\u201d Trudeau\u2019s skepticism turned to horror when Alter described Amazon\u2019s approach. \u201cBeing one of thousands of projects didn\u2019t seem very promising,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cHanging it up on the Amazon Prime Web site and letting it be troll bait didn\u2019t appeal at all. I thought it would be a very public humiliation, as opposed to the usual way pilots get shot down\u2014in private with executives.\u201d\n\nTrudeau went ahead with Amazon, anyway, with Alter as an executive producer. \u201cFor me, this was a chance to feel like I had a piece of the dawning digital age,\u201d Alter, whose longtime employer, Newsweek, had been sold for a dollar, said. After the pilot, starring John Goodman, appeared on Amazon, last April, almost four thousand customer reviews came in. Trudeau didn\u2019t read them\u2014\u201cIt was not good for my mental health, so instead I looked at the percentages, since I figured that\u2019s what Amazon was looking at.\u201d The ratings were largely positive, and in May Amazon Studios commissioned Trudeau to write ten episodes of \u201cAlpha House.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, of course, I\u2019m all for the process,\u201d Trudeau said, smiling. \u201cYay, democracy!\u201d\n\n\u201cAlpha House\u201d had a glitzy premi\u00e8re, on November 11th, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, with young women in black checking guests\u2019 names on Kindles. Bezos attended, with his parents seated next to Trudeau. \u201cAlpha House\u201d became popular on Amazon Prime streaming video, but it garnered less critical praise and public interest than \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d from Amazon\u2019s rival Netflix. \u201cBetas,\u201d Amazon\u2019s second original series, about four friends with a social-app startup, was a bomb. Many more shows are in the pipeline (including a New Yorker project developed by Cond\u00e9 Nast Entertainment).\n\nFor all the emphasis on crowdsourcing, Trudeau said, almost all the shows that Amazon approved were created by professionals. \u201cThey may be spinning their wheels with all their data crunching,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can easily argue that it stymies experimentation, that it prevents innovation, because the audience is telling you what they want.\u201d But Trudeau was free to ignore the data from \u201cAlpha House\u201d\u2014Amazon kept it confidential even from him.\n\nLast August, Bezos bought the Washington Post from the Graham family, for a quarter of a billion dollars. The purchase didn\u2019t involve Amazon, and Bezos\u2019s decision seems unrelated to his company or to a search for profits. \u201cThe core business of Amazon would dictate against buying the Post,\u201d Barry Diller, the media mogul, who sat on the newspaper\u2019s board until it was sold to Bezos, said. \u201cNo matter what you do with the Post, it is primarily a print publication. Amazon\u2019s ambitions in content don\u2019t go to news and information at all.\u201d\n\nNor has Bezos shown much interest in politics, except as it involves his business. A moderate libertarian, he has donated money to oppose a \u201cmillionaires\u2019 tax\u201d in Washington State, and to support gay marriage. Shel Kaphan, Bezos\u2019s former deputy, remembers him repeating Thomas Jefferson\u2019s quote about the best government being the least government, but Kaphan worries more about Bezos applying his \u201ctake no prisoners\u201d pragmatism to the Post: \u201cThere are conflicts of interest with Amazon\u2019s many contracts with the government, and he\u2019s got so many policy issues going, like sales tax.\u201d One ex-employee who worked closely with Bezos warned, \u201cAt Amazon, drawing a distinction between content people and business people is a foreign concept.\u201d\n\nPerhaps buying the Post was meant to be a good civic deed. Bezos has a family foundation, but he has hardly involved himself in philanthropy. In 2010, Charlie Rose asked him what he thought of Bill Gates\u2019s challenge to other billionaires to give away most of their wealth. Bezos didn\u2019t answer. Instead, he launched into a monologue on the virtue of markets in solving social problems, and somehow ended up touting the Kindle.\n\nBezos bought a newspaper for much the same reason that he has invested money in a project for commercial space travel: the intellectual challenge. With the Post, the challenge is to turn around a money-losing enterprise in a damaged industry, and perhaps to show a way for newspapers to thrive again. When Bezos visited the paper in September, he told several hundred staffers what they hoped to hear: that their primary customers were readers (not advertisers), that news should drive business decisions, and that cutting the news budget was suicidal. He mentioned recent articles he\u2019d liked, including one, by the blogger Max Fisher, headlined \u201c9 questions about syria you were too embarrassed to ask.\u201d He frequently used the word \u201cbundle,\u201d suggesting that readers should be induced to subscribe to the whole paper instead of finding stray articles through Web searches. \u201cMy job is to provide a runway until we take off,\u201d Bezos said.\n\nOn January 16th, Bezos visited the paper again. It was kept secret from everyone at the Post except a few top editors and executives. Bezos is bringing Amazon\u2019s obsession with secrecy to a paper known for its openness. At Amazon\u2019s Seattle headquarters, the floor devoted to the Kindle is known as Area 51, because it\u2019s off limits to everyone not involved in the product. When one Amazon employee attended an orientation meeting several years ago, and another new hire declared that she had just come from the National Security Agency, he wondered how she would fit in. \u201cIt took me a few weeks,\u201d the employee said. \u201cShe was going to fit in a lot better than I was.\u201d Bezos\u2019s aversion to scrutiny runs so deep that it is bound to create problems for newspaper people whose job is to expose what powerful institutions want to hide.\n\nOn his January visit, Bezos discussed the paper\u2019s design for tablets. He also summoned Henry Blodget, the former securities analyst who, in 2003, was charged with civil fraud and barred from the industry; in 2007, he became the C.E.O. of Business Insider, a Web magazine in which Bezos is a major investor. Blodget spoke to senior staff at the Post about the challenges of publishing news on the Internet. In a recent interview with the Times, he said, \u201cDigital journalism is as different from print and TV journalism as print and TV are from each other.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks after Bezos\u2019s visit, the Post\u2019s editor, Martin Baron, announced that the 2014 budget included funds for a Web-site redesign and provided more money for political reporting, the Sunday magazine, and digital content. It wasn\u2019t enough to prevent the exodus of Ezra Klein, Max Fisher, and other prominent bloggers, who have left for Vox Media. For journalists who remain at the Post, the hope generated by Bezos\u2019s purchase is, in part, a sign of their desperate situation. Bezos must know how to fix the newspaper business, the thinking goes, because he\u2019s a titan of the digital world that helped lay waste to it. \u201cThe arrogance level in Silicon Valley is very high,\u201d a former senior editor said. \u201cThe reality is they don\u2019t have the beginning of an answer.\u201d\n\nBook publishers\u2019 dependence on Amazon, however unwilling, keeps growing. Amazon constitutes a third of one major house\u2019s retail sales on a given week, with the growth chart pointing toward fifty per cent. By contrast, independents represent under ten per cent, and one New York editor said that only a third of the three thousand brick-and-mortar bookstores still in existence would remain financially healthy if publishers didn\u2019t waive certain terms of payment. Jane Friedman, the former Random House and HarperCollins executive, who now runs a digital publisher called Open Road Integrated Media, told me, \u201cIf there wasn\u2019t an Amazon today, there probably wouldn\u2019t be a book business.\u201d The senior editor who met Grandinetti said, \u201cThey\u2019re our biggest customer, we want them to succeed. As I recover from being punched in the face by Amazon, I also worry: What if they are a bubble? What if the stock market suddenly says, \u2018We want a profit\u2019? You don\u2019t want your father who abuses you physically to lose his job.\u201d\n\nPublishers are less like abused minors and more like financially insecure adults who rely on the support of a bullying uncle. Their dependence breeds bad faith. \u201cPrivately, we berate Amazon,\u201d the marketing executive said. \u201cYet we\u2019re always trying to figure out how to work with them.\u201d\n\nThe Big Six recently became the Big Five, with the merger of Random House and Penguin, which created the largest publishing house in the world. Several industry people told me that it was intended to provide Penguin Random House, as the new company is called, with more bargaining power against Amazon. But book publishers have been consolidating for several decades, under the ownership of media conglomerates like News Corporation, which squeeze them for profits, or holding companies such as Rivergroup, which strip them to service debt. The effect of all this corporatization, as with the replacement of independent booksellers by superstores, has been to privilege the blockbuster. Penguin Random House and Barnes & Noble are hardly Davids to Amazon\u2019s Goliath. \u201cIt\u2019s like you turn into your enemy,\u201d the head of one New York house said. \u201cPublishers are in a bad position to be representing themselves as speaking for the artists.\u201d\n\nLately, digital titles have levelled off at about thirty per cent of book sales. Whatever the temporary fluctuations in publishers\u2019 profits, the long-term outlook is discouraging. This is partly because Americans don\u2019t read as many books as they used to\u2014they are too busy doing other things with their devices\u2014but also because of the relentless downward pressure on prices that Amazon enforces. The digital market is awash with millions of barely edited titles, most of it dreck, while readers are being conditioned to think that books are worth as little as a sandwich. \u201cAmazon has successfully fostered the idea that a book is a thing of minimal value,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a widget.\u201d\n\nThere are two ways to think about this. Amazon believes that its approach encourages ever more people to tell their stories to ever more people, and turns writers into entrepreneurs; the price per unit might be cheap, but the higher number of units sold, and the accompanying royalties, will make authors wealthier. Jane Friedman, of Open Road, is unfazed by the prospect that Amazon might destroy the old model of publishing. \u201cThey are practicing the American Dream\u2014competition is good!\u201d she told me. Publishers, meanwhile, \u201chave been banks for authors. Advances have been very high.\u201d In Friedman\u2019s view, selling digital books at low prices will democratize reading: \u201cWhat do you want as an author\u2014to sell books to as few people as possible for as much as possible, or for as little as possible to as many readers as possible?\u201d\n\nThe answer seems self-evident, but there is a more skeptical view. Several editors, agents, and authors told me that the money for serious fiction and nonfiction has eroded dramatically in recent years; advances on mid-list titles\u2014books that are expected to sell modestly but whose quality gives them a strong chance of enduring\u2014have declined by a quarter. These are the kinds of book that particularly benefit from the attention of editors and marketers, and that attract gifted people to publishing, despite the pitiful salaries. Without sufficient advances, many writers will not be able to undertake long, difficult, risky projects. Those who do so anyway will have to expend a lot of effort mastering the art of blowing their own horn. \u201cWriting is being outsourced, because the only people who can afford to write books make money elsewhere\u2014academics, rich people, celebrities,\u201d Colin Robinson, a veteran publisher, said. \u201cThe real talent, the people who are writers because they happen to be really good at writing\u2014they aren\u2019t going to be able to afford to do it.\u201d\n\nSeven-figure bidding wars still break out over potential blockbusters, even though these battles often turn out to be follies. The quest for publishing profits in an economy of scarcity drives the money toward a few big books. So does the gradual disappearance of book reviewers and knowledgeable booksellers, whose enthusiasm might have rescued a book from drowning in obscurity. When consumers are overwhelmed with choices, some experts argue, they all tend to buy the same well-known thing.\n\nThese trends point toward what the literary agent called \u201cthe rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer.\u201d A few brand names at the top, a mass of unwashed titles down below, the middle hollowed out: the book business in the age of Amazon mirrors the widening inequality of the broader economy.\n\nIn 2009, after a career at publishers large and small, Robinson was laid off by Scribner, amid downsizing. Faced with his own professional extinction, and perhaps the industry\u2019s, he co-founded a new company, OR Books, with a different business model. Robinson did research and found that fifty to sixty per cent of the list price of a book goes to Amazon or to another retailer. When he was starting out, in the eighties, that figure was more like thirty or forty per cent. A small-to-midsize publisher has to spend between ten and fifteen per cent on sales, warehousing, and shipping. This leaves little more than twenty-five per cent of the book\u2019s price for editorial counsel, production costs, publicity, paying the author, and whatever profit might be left over. A shared sensibility for a certain kind of fiction or nonfiction writing unites everyone along the way: authors, agents, editors, designers, marketers, reviewers, readers. \u201cThe only point at which Bezos enters that chain is to take all the money and the e-mail address of the buyer,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThere\u2019s an entire community of people, and Bezos stands in the middle of it and collects the money.\u201d\n\nInstead of going through Amazon, OR Books sells directly to customers, using printers in Minnesota and the U.K. It pays about fifteen per cent to the printer and keeps the rest. \u201cAfter four years, we\u2019re just profitable,\u201d Robinson told me. \u201cIt works.\u201d\n\nTo the Big Five, locked in a death struggle with Amazon and the distracted American reader, this kind of experimentation might seem unrealistic. To survive, they are trying to broaden their distribution channels, not narrow them. But Andrew Wylie thinks that it\u2019s exactly what a giant like Penguin Random House should do. \u201cIf they did, in my opinion they would save the industry. They\u2019d lose thirty per cent of their sales, but they would have an additional thirty per cent for every copy they sold, because they\u2019d be selling directly to consumers. The industry thinks of itself as Procter & Gamble*. What gave publishers the idea that this was some big goddam business? It\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s a tiny little business, selling to a bunch of odd people who read.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, those people are obsessed with how they read books\u2014whether it\u2019s on a Kindle or an iPad or on printed pages. This conversation, though important, takes place in the shallows and misses the deeper currents that, in the digital age, are pushing American culture under the control of ever fewer and more powerful corporations. Bezos is right: gatekeepers are inherently \u00e9litist, and some of them have been weakened, in no small part, because of their complacency and short-term thinking. But gatekeepers are also barriers against the complete commercialization of ideas, allowing new talent the time to develop and learn to tell difficult truths. When the last gatekeeper but one is gone, will Amazon care whether a book is any good? \u2666Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1288346", "artist_names": "Anne

chase\nIs overpopulated, with the talkin' by the haters say\nHaters they, rendered obsolete just like the pager\nI run for city council, but might just make the mayor brink\nLay your hands Jerry Rice, better know I got it\nThe worlds up in my palm and know Stephan will never drop it\nI push it and I cop it, I try to make a profit\nBut I'm tired of distressing when collecting is the object\nOf affection, say you disagree with my direction\nI say I'm trying to dodge the felony and not the sentence\nI write down, right now, I might just take a flight now\nOr maybe take a step or two, I might just take a flight now\nWhen the floor up, on a tour bus\nWith a bad bitch bitch when I pour up\nBut I'm bored, I'm bored\nI guess it ain't the life for me\nUntil the day I pass away, I may be more than likely\nJust slept on, but I kept on\nOne shot but he guessed wrong\nWish Trayvon had a vest on\nDamn!\n[Verse 2: Obvi]\nLets just pledge allegiance to the land of the free\nIn a country filled with bullshit that was branded by greed\nThe innocence with no sense, that just demanded to bleed\nPlant it to seed and then they profit off and stepped in disease\nAnd you want me to quit rapping, and work for your industries\nAnd go to war on drugs for the drugs that you put in the streets\nYou ever think, that you get within reach of my inner piece?\nAnd I take some I wish you would put it into peace\nNow learn from your lesson, or find out the harder way\nThey say \"Love should be destined,\" but it burns your heart away\nI give you pennies for your thoughts, and I ain't talking Hardaway\nI'm so tired of this ten dollar an hour starter pay\nBut I'm all that, I'm on my Kenan and Kel thing\nYou been getting saved by the bell, Mr. Belding\nMad because your girlfriend, wanna make

be nothing as funny, just look at me now, Dolo\nStarted from the bottom, came up, go go\nTried to battle, get ate, Ocho\nI'm from the 510 where killa's is only a block away\nWho let their choppas spray, cock back, a blaka blaka away\nKnock your block away like Tetris, don't give a shit about critics\nEat up these wack cats, shit out gimmicks, spit out lyrics\nPlus I'm spitting like there's no

I've been losing all my battles\nAnd I fought so hard to keep you\nCause we both know that I had you\nNow you fade away my shit\nAnd baby I couldn't be more sad\nAnd I wanted you to be my wife\nI wish It went just how we planned it\nNow that you've been gone I took some pills so I don't panic\nIn the end I know it hurts me\nIts been difficult to manage\nMy addictions taking hold\nI underestimate the damage\nThe mystery of you never coming back is haunting me\nSo much history with you\nI mean some days where you just wanted me\nI'm Sorry that I failed in more tim\u0435s than I can count, Bae\nDamn, I miss you so damn much\nYou found me lost when I was drowning\n[Verse 2]\nYou know I hold on to th\u0435 memories\nThe pictures that I got with me\nI'm always gonna love you\nAnd theres no one fucking stopping me\nI wish that I could go back\nChanging choices that I've made then\nAnd that to me is fading\nIn your mind wish I could save them\n[?] but I love you and you always gon' be everything\nWe drifting far apart but in my soul I know it was meant to be\nTrauma of a past so when we crashed she was almost 17\nTheres nothing in this world to make me feel like you ain't heavenly\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl, I know that you was meant for me\nYeah I know that you was meant for me\nLord knows that it was meant to be\nYou can't tell me it ain't meant to be\nI know that you was meant for me\nGirl, I know that you was meant for me\nYou can't tell me it ain't meant to be\nLord knows that it was meant to be\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI can't be wasting no more time\nThis breakup showed me that I gotta win\nThe devil opened up my grave theres no way I'd be falling in\nA place that I've been mad, a places wish I never saw again\nI'm crying out to God and beg him: Forgive me all my sins\nThese self inflicted wounds reminds myself\nThat I have got to change\nI didn't even realize all these years put you through all this pain\nWas hurting bad myself but its myself that I have got to blame\nGon' love you for eternity, I say this, Lord, in Jesus' name\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nYour emotions acting built up over time\nThe bridge had finally broke\nWas blind itself for years it took you leave and so I finally know\nYou prolly ain't gon' hear this\nIf you do, just know, you ate my soul\nI'm begging and I'm pleading and I know that shit was pityful\nIt made me feel pathetic, I regret it, I can't change it though\nThank god that I got music still, the only thing that feel like home\nContemplating suicide, I put that barrel to my dome\nHeaven and hell is real would be so selfish if I would have done it\n\n[Chorus]\nGirl, I know that you was meant for me\nYeah I know that you was meant for me\nLord knows that it was meant to be\nYou can't tell me it ain't meant to be\nI know that you was meant for me\nGirl, I know that you was meant for me\nYou can't tell me it ain't meant to be\nLord knows that it was meant to be\n\n[Outro]\nI can't be wasting no more time\nThis breakup showed me that I gotta win\nThe devil opened up my grave theres no way I'd be falling in\nPlaces I've been mad, places wish I never saw again\nI'm crying out to god and beg him: forgive me all my sins\nThese self inflicted wounds reminds myself\nThat I have got to change\nI didn't even realize all these years put you through all this pain\nWas hurting bad myself but its myself that I have got to blame\nDon't love you for eternity, I say this, Lord, in Jesus' nameEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1627938", "artist_names": "The

best in town\nJust by chance you crossed the diamond with the pearl\nYou turned it on the world\nThat's when you turned the world around\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDid you feel like Jesus?\nDid you realize\nThat you were a champion in their eyes?\n[Verse 2]\nOn the hill the stuff was laced with kerosene\nBut yours was kitchen clean\nEveryone stopped to stare at your technicolor motor home\nEvery A-Frame had your number on the wall\nYou must have had it all\nYou'd go to L.A. on a dare\nAnd you'd go it alone\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCould you live forever?\nCould you see the day?\nCould you feel your whole world fall apart and fade away?\n\n[Chorus]\nGet along\nGet along, Kid Charlemagne\nGet along, Kid Charlemagne\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow your patrons have all left you in the red\nYour low rent friends are dead\nThis life can be very strange\nAll those Day-Glo freaks who used to paint the face\nThey've joined the human race\nSome things will never change\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nSon, you were mistaken\nYou are obsolete\nLook at all the white men on the street\n\n[Chorus]\nGet along\nGet along, Kid Charlemagne\nGet along, Kid Charlemagne\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 4]\nClean this mess up else we'll all end up in jail\nThose test tubes and the scale\nJust get it all out of here\nIs there gas in the car\nYes, there's gas in the car\nI think the people down the hall\nKnow who you are\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nCareful what you carry\n'Cause the man is wise\nYou are still an outlaw in their eyes\n[Chorus]\nGet along\nGet along, Kid Charlemagne (Get along)\nGet along, Kid Charlemagne\n\n[Instrumental Outro]3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/5139971", "artist_names": "\u200bxxri", "full_title": "\u200bhannah\u2019s cool epic amazing

Clouston", "lyrics": "The Book of Noodles: Chapter 5 LyricsCHAPTER V.\nTHE SILLY SON.\n\nAMONG the favourite jests of all Peoples, from Iceland to Japan, from India to England, are the droll adventures and mishaps of the silly son, who contrives to muddle everything he is set to do. In vain does his poor mother try to direct him in \"the way he should go\": she gets him a wife, as a last resource; but a fool he is still, and a fool he will always be. His blunders and disasters are chronicled in penny chap-books and in nursery rhymes, of infinite variety. Who has not heard how\n\nSimple Simon went a-fishing\nFor to catch a whale,\nBut all the water he had got\nWas in his mother's pail?\n\nan adventure which recalls another nursery rhyme regarding Simon's still more celebrated prototypes:\np.122\n\nThree men of Gotham\nWent to sea in a bowl;\nIf the bowl had been stronger,\nMy tale had been longer.\n\nThen there is the prose history of Simple Simon's Misfortunes; or, his Wife Marjory's Outrageous Cruelty, which tells (2) of Simon's wedding, and how his wife Marjory scolded him for putting on his roast-meat clothes (i.e., Sunday clothes) the very next morning after he was married; (2) how she dragged him up the chimney in a basket, a-smoke-drying, wherein they used to dry bacon, which made him look like a red herring; (3) how Simon lost a sack of corn as he was going to the mill to have it ground; (4) how Simon went to market with a basket of eggs, but broke them by the way: also how he was put into the stocks; (5) how Simon's wife cudgelled him for not bringing her money for the eggs; (6) how Simon lost his wife's pail and burnt the bottom of her kettle; (7) how Simon's wife sent him to buy two pounds of soap, but going over the bridge, he let his money fall in the river: also how a ragman ran away with his clothes. No wonder if, after this crowning misfortune, poor Simon \"drank a bottle of sack, to poison himself, as being weary of his life\"!\n\nAgain, we have The Unfortunate Son; or,\n\np.123\n\na Kind Wife is worth Gold, being full of Mirth and Pastime, which commences thus:\n\nThere was a man but one son had,\nAnd he was all his joy;\nBut still his fortune was but bad,\nThough he was a pretty boy.\n\nHis father sent him forth one day\nTo feed a flock of sheep,\nAnd half of them were stole away\nWhile he lay down asleep!\n\nNext day he went with one Tom Goff\nTo reap as he was seen,\nWhen he did cut his fingers off,\nThe sickle was so keen!\nAnother of the chap-book histories of noodles is that of Simple John and his Twelve Misfortunes, an imitation of Simple Simon; it was still popular amongst the rustics of Scotland fifty years ago.\n\nThe adventures of Silly Matt, the Norwegian counterpart of our typical English booby, as related in Asbjornson's collection of Norse folk-tales, furnish some curious examples of the transmission of popular fictions:\n\nThe mother of Silly Matt tells him one day that he should build a bridge across the river\n\np.124\n\nand take toll of every one who wished to go over it; so he sets to work with a will, and when the bridge is finished, stands at one end--\"at the receipt of custom.\" Three men come up with loads of hay, and Matt demands toll of them, so they each give him a wisp of hay. Next comes a pedlar, with all sorts of small wares in his pack, and Matt gets from him two needles. On his return home his mother asks him what he has got that day. \"Hay and needles,\" says Matt. Well! and what had he done with the hay? \"I put some of it in my mouth,\" quoth he, \"and as it tasted like grass, I threw it into the river.\" She says he ought to have spread it on the byre-floor. \"Very good,\" replies the dutiful Matt; \"I'll remember that next time.\" And what had he done with the needles? He stuck them into the hay. \"Ah,\" says the mother, \"you should rather have stuck them in and out of your cap, and brought them home to me.\" Well! well! Matt will not forget to do so next time. The following day a man comes to the bridge with a sack of meal and gives Matt a pound of it; then comes a smith, who gives him a gimlet: the meal he spread on the byre-floor, and the gimlet he stuck in and out of his cap. His mother tells him he should have come home for a bucket to hold the meal, and the gimlet he should have put up his sleeve. Very good!\n\np.125\n\nMatt will not forget next time. Another day some men come to the bridge with kegs of brandy, of which Matt gets a pint, and pours it into his sleeve; next comes a man driving some goats and their young ones, and gives Matt a kid, which he treads down into a bucket. His mother says he should have led the goat home with a cord round its neck, and put the brandy in a pail. Next day he gets a pat of butter and drags it home with a string. After this his mother despairs of his improvement, till it occurs to her that he might not be such a noodle if he had a wife. So she bids him go and see whether he cannot find some lass who will take him for a husband. Should he meet any folk on his way, he ought to say to them, \"God's peace!\" Matt accordingly sets off in quest of a wife, and meets a she-wolf and her seven cubs. \"God's peace!\" says Matt, and then returns home. When his mother learns of this, she tells him he should have cried, \"Huf! huf! you jade wolf!\" Next day he goes off again, and meeting a bridal party, he cries, \"Huf! huf! you jade wolf!\" and goes back to his mother and acquaints her of this fresh adventure. \"O you great silly!\" says she; \"you should have said, 'Ride happily, bride and bridegroom!'\" Once more Matt sets out to seek a wife, and seeing on the road a bear taking a ride on a horse,\n\np.126\n\nhe exclaims joyfully, \"Ride happily, bride and bridegroom!\" and then returns home. His mother, on hearing of this new piece of folly, tells him he should have cried, \"To the devil with you!\" Again he sets out, and meeting a funeral procession, he roars, \"To the devil with you!\" His mother says he should have cried, \"May your poor soul have mercy!\" and sends him off for the fifth time to look for a lass. On the road he sees some gipsies busy skinning a dead dog, upon which he piously exclaims, \"May your poor soul have mercy!\" His mother now goes herself to get him a wife, finds a lass that is willing to marry him, and invites her to dinner. She privately tells Matt how he should comport himself in the presence of his sweetheart; he should cast an eye at her now and then. Matt understands her instruction most literally: stealing into the sheepfold, he plucks out the eyes of all the sheep and goats, and puts them in his pocket. When he is seated beside his sweetheart, he casts a \"sheep's eye\" at her, which hits her on the nose.[1]\n\nThis last incident, as we have seen, occurs in the Talrs of the Men of Gotham (ante, p. 41), and it is also found in a Venetian\n\n[1] Abridged from the story of \"Silly Matt\" in Sir George W. Dasent's Tales from the Fjeld.\n\np.127\n\nstory (Bernoni, Fiabe, No. 11), entitled \"The Fool,\" of which the following is the first part:\nOnce upon a time there was a mother who had a son with little brains. One morning she said, \"We must get up early, for we have to make bread.\" So they both rose early, and began to make bread. The mother made the loaves, but took no pains to make them the same size. Her son said to her finally, \"How small you have made this loaf, mother.'' \"Oh,\" said she, \"it does not matter whether they are big or little, for the proverb says, 'Large and small, all must go to mass.'\" \"Good! good!\" said her son. When the bread was made, instead of taking it to the baker's, the son took it to the church, for it was the hour for mass, saying, \"My mother said that, 'large and small, all must go to mass.'\" So he threw the loaves down in the middle of the church. Then he went home to his mother, and said, \"I have done what you told me to do.\" \"Good! Did you take the bread to the baker's?\" \"O mother, if you had seen how they all looked at me!\" \"You might also have cast an eye on them in return,\" said his mother. \"Wait; wait. I will cast an eye at them too,\" he exclaimed, and went to the stable and cut out the eyes of all the animals, and putting them in a handker-\n\np.128\n\nchief, went to the church; and when any man or woman looked at him, he threw an eye at them.[1]\n\nSilly Matt has a brother in Russia, according to M. Leger's Contcs Populaires Slaves, published at Paris in 1882: An old man and his wife had a son, who was about as great a noodle as could be. One day his mother said to him, \"My son, thou shouldst go about among people, to get thyself sharpened and rubbed down a little.\" \"Yes, mother,\" says he; \"I'm off this moment.\" So he went to the village, and saw two men threshing pease. He ran up to them, and rubbed himself now on one and then on the other. \"No nonsense!\" cried the men. \"Get away.\" But he continued to rub himself on them, till at last they would stand it no longer, and beat him with their flails so lustily that he could hardly crawl home.\" What art thou crying about, child?\" asked his mother. He related his misfortune. \"Ah, my child,\" said she, \"how silly thou art! Thou shouldst have said to them, 'God aid you, good men! Do you wish me to help you to thresh?' and then they would have given thee some pease for thy\n\n[1] Professor Crane's Italian Popular Tales, p. 302. This actual throwing of eyes occurs in the folk-tales of Europe generally.\n\np.129\n\ntrouble, and we should have had them to cook and eat.\" On another occasion the noodle again went through the village, and met some people carrying a dead man. \"May God aid you, good men!\" he exclaimed. \"Do you wish me to help you to thresh?\" But he got himself well thrashed once more for this ill-timed speech. When he reached home, he howled, \"They've felled me to the ground, beaten me, and plucked my beard and hair!\" and told of his new mishap. \"Ah, noodle!\" said his mother, \"thou shouldst have said, 'God give peace to his soul!' Thou shouldst have taken off thy bonnet, wept, and fallen upon thy knees. They would then have given thee meat and drink.\" Again he went to the village, and met a marriage procession. So he took off his bonnet, and cried with all his might, \"God grant peace to his soul!\" and then burst into tears. \"What brute is this?\" said the wedding company. \"We laugh and amuse ourselves, and he laments as if he were at a funeral.\" So they leaped out of the carriages, and beat him soundly on the ribs. Home he returned, crying, \"They've beaten me, thrashed me, and torn my beard and hair!\" and related what had happened. \"My son,\" said his mother, \"thou shouldst have leaped and danced with them.\" The next time he went to the village he took his bag-\n\np.130\n\npipe under his arm. At the end of the street a cart-shed was on fire. The noodle ran to the spot, and began to play on his bagpipe and to dance and caper about, for which he was abused as before. Going back to his mother in tears, he told her how he had fared. \"My son,\" said she, \"thou shouldst have carried water and thrown it on the fire, like the other folks.\" Three days later, when his ribs were well again, the noodle went through the village once more, and seeing a man roasting a little pig, he seized a vessel of water, ran up with it, and threw the water on the fire. This time also he was beaten, and when he got home, and told his mother of his ill-luck, she resolved never again to allow him to go abroad; so he remains by the fireside, as great a fool as ever.\n\nThis species of noodle is also known in Japan. He is the hero of a farce entitled Hone Kaha, or Ribs and Skin, which has been done into English by Mr. Basil Hall Chamberlain, in his Classical Poetry of the Japanese. The rector of a Buddhist temple tells his curate that he feels he is now getting too old for the duties of his office, and means to resign the benefice in his favour. Before retiring to his private chamber, he desires the curate to let him know if any persons visit\n\np.131\n\nthe temple, and bids him, should he be in want of information regarding any matter, to come to him. A parishioner calls to borrow an umbrella. The curate lends him a new one, and then goes to the rector and informs him of this visitor. \"You have donewrong,\"says the rector. \"You ought to have said that you should have been happy to comply with such a small request, but, unfortunately, the rector was walking out with it the other day, when, at a place where four roads meet, a sudden gust of wind blew the skin to one side and the ribs to another; we have tied the ribs and skin together in the middle, and hung it from the ceiling. Something like that,\" adds the rector, \"something with an air of truth about it, is what you should have said.\" Next comes another parishioner, who wishes to borrow a horse. The curate replies with great politeness, \"The request with which you honour me is a mere trifle, but the rector took it out with him a few days since, and coming to the junction of four cross roads, a gust of wind blew the ribs to one side and the skin to another, and we have tied them together, and hung them from the ceiling; so I fear it would not suit your purpose.\" \"It is a horse I want,\" said the man. \"Precisely--a horse: I am aware of it,\" quoth the curate, and the man went off, not a little perplexed, after which\n\np.132\n\nthe curate reports this new affair to the rector, who says it was to an umbrella, not to a horse, that such a story was applicable. Should any one come again to borrow a horse, he ought to say, \"I much regret that I cannot comply with your request. The fact is, we lately turned him out to grass, and becoming frolicsome, he dislocated his thigh, and is now lying, covered with straw, in a corner of the stable.\" \"Something like that, \"adds the rector, \"something with an air of truth about it, is what you should say.\" A third parishioner comes to invite the rector and the curate to a feast at his house. \"For myself,\" says the curate, \"I promise to come; but I fear it will not be convenient for the rector to accompany me.\" \"I presume then,\" says the man, \"that he has some particular business on hand?\" \"No, not any particular business,\" answers the curate; \"but the truth is, we lately turned him out to grass, and becoming frisky, he dislocated his thigh, and now lies in a corner of the stable, covered with straw.\" \"I spoke of the rector,\" says the parishioner. \"Yes, of the rector. I quite understand,\" responds the curate, very complaisantly, upon which the man goes away, not knowing what to make of such a strange account of the rector's condition. This last affair puts the rector into a fury, and he cuffs his intended successor, exclaiming,\n\np.133\n\n\"When was I ever frisky, I should like to know?\"\n\nAs great a jolterhead as any of the foregoing was the hero of a story in Cazette's \"Continuation\" of the Arabian Nights, entitled \"L'Imb\u00e9cille; ou, L'Histoire de Xailoun.\"[1] This noodle's wife said to him one day,' \"Go and buy some pease, and don't forget that it is pease you are to buy; continually repeat 'Pease!' till you reach the market-place.\" So he went off, with \"Pease! pease!\" always in his mouth. He passed the corner of a street where a merchant who had pearls for sale was proclaiming his wares in a loud voice, saying, \"In the name of the Prophet, pearls!\" Xailoun's attention was at once attracted by the display of pearls, and at the same time he was occupied in retaining the lesson his wife had taught him, and putting his hand in\n\n[1] In Le Cabinet des F\u00e9es, 1788 (tome xxxviii., p. 337 ff).--There can be no such name as Xailoun in Arabic; that of the noodle's wife, Oitba, may be intended for \"Utba,\" Cazotte has so Frenchified the names of the characters in his tales as to render their identification with the Arabic originals (where he had any such) often impossible. Although this story is not found in any known Arabian text of the Book of the Thousand and One Nights, yet the incidents for the most part occur in several Eastern story-books.\n\np.134\n\nthe box of pearls, he cried out, \"Pease! pease! The merchant, supposing Xailoun played upon him and depreciated his pearls by wishing to make them pass for false ones, struck him a severe blow. \"Why do you strike me?\" said Xailoun. \"Because you insult me,\" answered the merchant. \"Do you suppose I am trying to deceive people?\" \"No,\" said the noodle. \"But what must I say, then?\" \"If you will cry properly, say as I do, 'Pearls, in the name of the Prophet!'\" He next passed by the shop of a merchant from whom some pearls had been stolen, and his manner of crying, \"Pearls!\" etc., which was not nearly so loud as usual, appeared to the merchant very suspicious. \"The man who has stolen my pearls,\" thought he, \"has probably recognised me, and when he passes my shop lowers his voice in crying the goods.\" Upon this suspicion he ran after Xailoun, and stopping him, said, \"Show me your pearls.\" The poor fool was in great confusion, and the merchant thought he had got the thief. The supposed seller of pearls was soon surrounded by a great crowd, and the merchant at last discovered that he was a perfect simpleton. \"Why,\" said he, \"do you cry that you sell pearls?\" \"What should I say, then?\" asked Xailoun. \"It is not true,\" said the merchant, not listening to him. \"It is not true,\"\n\np.135\n\nexclaimed the noodle. \"Let me repeat, 'It is not true,' that I may not forget it;\" and as he went on he kept crying, \"It is not true.\" His way led him towards a place where a man was proclaiming, \"In the name of the Prophet, lentils!\" Xailoun, induced by curiosity, went up to the man, his mouth full of the last words he remembered, and putting his hand into the sack, cried, \"It is not true.\" The sturdy villager gave him a blow that caused him to stagger, saying, \"What d'ye mean by giving me the lie about my goods, which I both sowed and reaped myself?\" Quoth the noodle, \"I have only tried to say what I ought to say.\" \"Well, then,\" rejoined the dealer, \"you ought to say, as I do, 'Lentils, in the name of the Prophet!'\" So our noodle at once took up this new cry, and proceeded on his way till he came to the bank of the river, where a fisherman had been casting his net for hours, and had frequently changed his place, without getting any fish. Xailoun, who was amused with every new thing he saw, began to follow the fisherman, and, that he should not forget his lesson, continued to repeat, \"Lentils, in the name of the Prophet!\" Suddenly the fisherman made a pretence of spreading his net, in order to wring and dry it, and having folded in his hand the rope to which it was fastened, he took hold\n\np.136\n\nof the simpleton and struck him some furious blows with it, saying, \"Vile sorcerer! cease to curse my fishing.\" Xailoun struggled, and at length disengaged himself. \"I am no sorcerer,\" said he. \"Well, if you are not,\" answered the fisherman, \"why do you cause me bad luck by your words every time I throw my net?\" \"I didn't mean to bring you bad luck,\" said the noodle. \"I only repeat what I was told to repeat.\" The fisherman then concluded that some of his enemies, who wished to do him an ill turn without exposing themselves, had prevailed upon this poor fellow to come and curse his fishing, so he said, \"I am sorry, brother, for having beaten you, but you were wrong to pronounce the words you did, thereby bringing bad luck to me, who never did you any harm.\" Quoth the simpleton, \"I only tried to say the words my wife told me not to forget.\" \"Do you know them?\" \"Yes.\" \"Well, place yourself beside me, and each time I cast my net you must say, 'In the name of the Prophet, instead of one, seven of the greatest and best!' 'But Xailoun thought what his wife had said was not so long as that. \"Oh, yes, it was,\" said the fisherman; \"and take care you don't miss a single word, and I shall give you some of the fish to take home with you.\" That he might not forget, Xailoun repeated it\n\np.137\n\nvery loud, but as he was afraid of the cord whenever he saw the fisherman drawing in his net, he ran away as fast as he could, but still repeating, \"In the name of the Prophet, instead of one, seven of the greatest and best!\" These words he pronounced in the midst of a crowd of people, through which the corpse of the k\u00e1z\u00ed (magistrate, or judge) was being carried to the burying ground, and the mullahs who surrounded the bier, scandalised by what they thought a horrible imprecation, exclaimed, \"How darest thou, wicked wretch, thus blaspheme? Is it not enough that Death has taken one of the greatest men of Baghd\u00e1d?\" The poor simpleton was skulking off in fear and trembling, when his sleeve was pulled by an aged slave, who told him that he ought to say, \"May Allah preserve his body and save his soul!\" So our noodle went on, repeating this new cry till he came to a street where a dead ass was being carted away. \"May Allah preserve his body and save his soul!\" he exclaimed. \"How he blasphemes!\" said the folk, and they set upon him with their fists and sticks, and gave him a sound drubbing. At length he got clear of them, and by chance came to the house of his wife's mother, but he only ventured to stand at the door and peep within. He was recognised, however, and asked what he\n\np.138\n\nwould have to eat--goat's flesh? rice?pease? Yes, it was pease he wanted, and having got some, he hastened home, and after relating all his mishaps, informed his wife, that her sister was very sick. His wife, having prepared herself to go to her mother's house, tells the simpleton to rock the baby should it awake and cry; feed the hen that was sitting; if the ass was thirsty, give her to drink; shut the door, and take care not to go to sleep, lest robbers should come and plunder the house. The baby awakes, and Xailoun rocks it to sleep again; so far, well. The hen seems uneasy; he concludes she is troubled with insects, like himself. So he takes up the hen, and thinking the best way to kill the insects was to stick a pin into them, he unluckily kills the hen. This was a serious matter, and while he considers what he should do in the circumstances, the ass begins to bray. \"Ah,\" says he, \"I've no time to attend to you just now; but when I am on your back, you can carry me to the river.'' Then he opened the door and let out the ass and her colt. After this he sat down on the eggs, and took the baby in his arms. His wife returning, knocks at the door. \"Let me in, you fool,\" she cries. \"I can't, for I am nursing the baby and hatching the eggs.\" At length she contrived to force open the door, and running up to her\n\np.139\n\nidiot of a husband, fetched him a blow that caused him to crush all the half-hatched eggs. Luckily she had met the ass and her foal on the road, so the amount of mischief done by her stupid spouse in her absence was not so great, all things considered.[1]\n\nThe misadventures of the Arabian idiot in his expedition to purchase pease present a close analogy to those of the typical English booby, only the latter end tragically:\n\nA woman sent her son one day to buy a sheep's head and pluck, and, lest he should forget his message, he kept bawling loudly as he went along, \"Sheep's head and pluck! sheep's head and pluck!\" In getting over a stile he fell and hurt himself, and forgot what he was sent for, so he stood a little to consider; and at last he thought he recollected\n\n[1] On a similar occasion Giuf\u00e0, the Sicilian brother to the Arabian fool, did somewhat more mischief. Once his mother went to church and told him to make some porridge for his baby-sister. Giuf\u00e0 made a great pot of porridge and fed the baby with it, and burned her mouth so that she died. Another time his mother on leaving home told him to feed the hen that was sitting and put her back in the nest, so that the eggs should not get cold. Giuf\u00e0 stuffed the hen with food so that he killed her, and then sat on the eggs himself until his mother returned.--See Crane's Italian Popular Tales, pp. 296-7.\n\np.140\n\nit, and began to shout, \"Liver and lights and gall and all!\" which he was repeating when he came up to a man who was very sick. The man, thinking the booby was mocking; him, laid hold of him, and after cuffing him, bade the booby cry, \"Pray God, send no more up!\" So he ran along uttering these words till he came to a field where a man was sowing wheat, who, on hearing what he took for a curse upon his labour, seized and thrashed him, and told him to repeat, \"Pray God, send plenty more!\" So the young jolterhead at once \"changed his tune,\" and was loudly singing out these words when he met a funeral. The chief mourner punished him for what he thought his fiendish wish, and bade him say, \"Pray God, send the soul to heaven!\" which he was bawling when he met a he and a she-dog going to be hanged. The good people who heard him were greatly shocked at his seeming profanity, and striking him, strictly charged him to cry, \"A he and a she-dog going to be hanged!\" On he went, accordingly, repeating this new cry, till he met a man and a woman going to be married. When the bridegroom heard what the booby said, he gave him many a good thump, and bade him say, \"I wish you much joy!\" This he was crying at the top of his voice when he came to a pit into which two\n\np.141\n\nlabourers had fallen, and one of them, enraged at what he thought his mockery of their misfortune, exerted all his strength and scrambled out, then beat the poor simpleton, and told him to say, \"The one is out; I wish the other was!\" Glad to be set free, the booby went on shouting these words till he met with a one-eyed man, who, like the others, taking what he was crying for a personal insult, gave him another drubbing, and then bade him cry, \"The one side gives good light, and I wish the other did!\" So he adopted this new cry, and continued his adventurous journey till he came to a house, one side of which was on fire. The people, hearing him bawling, \"The one side gives good light, and I wish the other did!\" at once concluded that he had set the house a-blazing; so they put him in prison, and the end was, the judge put on the black cap and condemned him to be hanged![1]\n\nWhen the noodle is persuaded, as in the following case of a Sinhalese wittol, by a gang of thieves to join them in a plundering expedition, they have little reason to be pleased with him, for he does not make a\n\n[1] Abridged and modified from a version in the Folk-Lore Record, vol. iii., pp. 153-5.\n\np.142\n\ngood \"cat's-paw.\" The Sinhalese noodle joined some thieves, took readily to their ways, and was always eager to accompany them on their marauding excursions. One night they took him with them, and boring a large hole in the wall of a house,[1] they sent him in, telling him to hand out the heaviest article he could lay hands upon. He readily went in, and seeing a large kurakkan-grinder,[2] thought that was the heaviest thing in the room, and attempted to remove it. But it proved too much for him alone, so he gently awoke a man who was sleeping in the room, and said to him, \"My friend, pray help me to remove this kurakkan-grinder. The man immediately guessed that thieves had entered the house, and gave the alarm. The thieves, who were waiting outside quite expectant, rushed away, and the noodle somehow or other managed to escape with them.\n\nNext night they again took him along with them, and after boring a hole in the wall of another house, sent him in with strict injunctions not to make a noise or wake anybody. He crept in noiselessly and entered a large\n\n[1] The usual mode by which in the East thieves break into houses, which are for the most part constructed of clay. See Job xxiv. 16.\n\n[2] Kurakkan is a species of grain.\n\np.143\n\nroom, in which was an old woman, fast asleep by the fire, with wide-open mouth. An earthen chattie, a wooden spoon, and a small bag of pease were also placed by the fire The noodle first proceeded to roast some pease in the chattie. When they were roasted to a nice brownish colour, and emitted a very tempting smell, he thought that the old woman might also enjoy a mouthful. He considered for a while how he might best offer some to her. He did not wish to wake her, as he was ordered not to wake anybody. Suddenly a bright idea struck him. Why should he not feed her? There she was sleeping with her mouth wide open. Surely it would be no difficult task to put some pease into her mouth. Taking some of the hot, smoking pease into the wooden spoon, he put the contents into her mouth. The woman awoke, screaming with all her might. The noise roused the other inmates of the house, who came rushing to the spot to see what was the matter. This time also the noodle managed to escape with the thieves; but in a subsequent adventure he, as well as the thieves, came to grief.[1]\n\nThe silly son of Italian popular tales is\n\n[1] The Orientalist, June, 1884, pp. 137-8.\n\np.144\n\nrepresented as being sent by his mother to sell a piece of linen which she had woven, saying to him, \"Now listen attentively to what I say: Walk straight along the road. Don't take less than such a price for this linen. Don't have any dealings with women who chatter. Whether you sell it to any one you meet on the way, or carry it into the market, offer it only to some quiet sort of body whom you may see standing apart and not gossiping or prating, for such as they will persuade you to take some sort of price that won't suit me at all.\" The booby answers, \"Yes, mamma,\" and goes off on his errand, keeping straight on, instead of taking the turnings leading to villages. It happened, as he went along, that the wife of the syndic of the next town was driving out with her maids, and had got out of the carriage, to walk a short distance, as the day was fine. Her maid tells her that there goes the simple son of the poor widow by the brook. \"What are you going to do, my good lad?\" kindly asks the lady. \"I'm not going to tell you,\" says the booby, \"because you were chattering.\" \"I see your mother has sent you to sell this linen,\" continues the lady; \"I will buy it of you,\" and she offers to pay twice as much as his mother had said she wanted. \"Can't sell it to you,\" replies he, \"for you\n\np.145\n\nwere chattering,\" and he continues his journey. Farther along he comes to a plaster statue by the roadside, so he says to himself, \"Here's one who stands apart and doesn't chatter; this is the one to sell the linen to,\" then aloud, \"Will you buy my linen, good friend?\" The statue maintained its usual taciturnity, and the booby concluded, as it did not speak, it was all right, so he said, \"The price is so-and-so; have the money ready by the time I come back, as I have to go on and buy some yarn for mother.\" On he went accordingly, and bought the yarn, and then came back to the statue. Some one passing by had in the meantime taken the linen. Finding it gone, \"It's all right,\" says he to himself; \"she's taken it,\" then aloud, \"Where's the money I told you to have ready?\" The statue remained silent. \"If you don't give me the money, I'll hit you on the head,\" he exclaimed, and raising his stick, he knocked the head off, and found it filled with gold coin. \"That's where you keep your money, is it? All right; I can pay myself.\" So saying, he filled his pockets with the coin and went home. When he handed his mother the money, and told her of his adventure with the quiet body by the roadside, she was afraid lest the neighbours should learn of her windfall if the booby knew its value,\n\np.146\n\nso she said to him, \"You've only brought me a lot of rusty nails; but never mind: you'll know better what to do next time,\" and put the money in an earthen jar. In her absence, a ragman comes to the house, and the booby asks him, \"Will you buy some rusty nails?\" The man desires to see them. \"Well,\" quoth he on beholding the treasure, \"they're not much worth, but I'll give you twelve pauls for the lot,\" and having handed over the sum, went off with his prize. When his mother comes home, the booby tells her what a bargain he had made for the rusty nails. \"Nails!\" she echoes, in consternation. \"Why, you foolish thing, they were gold coins!\" \"Can't help that now, mamma,\" he answers philosophically; \"you told me they were old rusty nails.\" By another lucky adventure, however, the booby is enabled to make up his mother's loss, finding a treasure which a party of robbers had left behind them at the foot of a tree.\n\nThe incident of a simpleton selling something to an inanimate object and discovering a hidden treasure occurs, in different forms, in the folk-tales of Asiatic as well as European countries. In a manuscript text of the Arabian Nights, brought from Constantinople by Wortley Montague, and now\n\np.147\n\npreserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, a more elaborate version of the Italian booby's adventure with the statue is found, in the \"Story of the Bang-eater and his Wife:\"\n\nIn former times there lived not far from Baghd\u00e1d a half-witted fellow, who was much addicted to the use of bang. Being reduced to poverty, he was obliged to sell his cow, which he took to the market one day, but the animal being in such a poor condition, no one would buy it, and after waiting till he was weary he returned homeward. On the way he stopped to repose himself under a tree, and tied the cow to one of the branches, while he ate some bread, and drank an infusion of his bang, which he always carried with him. In a short time it began to operate, so as to bereave him of the little sense he had, and his head was filled with ridiculous reveries. While he was musing, a bird beginning to chatter from her nest in the tree, he fancied it was a human voice, and that some woman had offered to purchase his cow, upon which he said, \"Reverend mother of Solomon,[1] dost thou wish to buy my\n\n[1] Ummu Sulayman. In Arabia the mother is generally addressed in this way as a mark of respect for having borne children, and the eldest gives the title. Our bang-eater supposed he was addressing an old woman who had (or might have had) a son named Solomon.\n\np.148\n\ncow?\" The bird again chattered. \"Well,\" replied he, \"what wilt thou give? I will sell her a bargain.\" The bird repeated her noise. \"Never mind,\" said the fool, \"for though thou hast forgotten to bring thy purse, yet, as I daresay thou art an honest woman, and hast bidden me ten dinars, I will trust thee with the cow, and call on Friday for the money.\" The bird renewed her chattering; so, leaving the cow tied to a branch of the tree, he returned home, exulting in the good bargain he had made for the animal. When he entered the house, his wife inquired what he had got for the cow, and he replied that he had sold her to an honest woman, who had promised to pay him ten pieces of gold next Friday. The wife was contented; and when Friday arrived, her noodle of a husband having, as usual, taken a dose of bang, repaired to the tree, and hearing the bird chattering as before, said, \"Well, good mother, hast thou brought the gold?\" The bird croaked. The blockhead, supposing the imaginary woman refused to pay him, became angry, and threw up a stone, which frightening the bird, it flew from its nest in the tree and alighted on a heap of ruins at some little distance. He now concluded that the woman had desired him to take his money from the heap, into which he accordingly dug, and found a copper\n\np.149\n\nvessel full of coin. This discovery convinced him he was right, and being withal an honest fellow, he only took ten pieces; then replacing the soil, \"May Allah requite thee for thy punctuality, good mother!\" he exclaimed, and returned to his wife, to whom he gave the money, informing her at the same time of the great treasure his friend the imaginary old woman possessed, and where it was concealed.\n\nThe wife waited till night, when she brought away the pot of gold, which her foolish husband observing, he said, \"It is dishonest to rob one who has paid us so punctually; and if thou dost not return it to its place, I will inform the wal\u00ed\" (governor of the city). She laughed at his simplicity, but fearing that he would execute his threat, she planned a stratagem to render it of no avail. Going to market, she purchased some meat and fish ready cooked, which she brought privately home, and concealed in the house. At night, while her husband was sleeping off the effects of his favourite narcotic, she strewed the provisions she had brought outside the door, and then awakening him, cried out, \"Dear husband, a most wonderful thing has occurred: there has been a violent storm while you slept, and, strange to tell, it has rained pieces of broiled meat and fish, which\n\np.150\n\nnow lie at the door!\" The blockhead got up, and seeing the food, was persuaded of the truth of his wife's story. The flesh and fish were gathered up, and he partook with much glee of the miraculous treat, but still said he would tell the wal\u00ed of her having stolen the treasure of the honest old woman.\n\nIn the morning he actually repaired to the wal\u00ed, and informed him that his wife had stolen a pot of gold, which she had still in her possession. Upon this the wal\u00ed had the woman apprehended. She denied the accusation, and was then threatened with death. \"My lord,\" said she, \"the power is in your hands; but I am an injured woman, as you will find by questioning my husband, who is deranged in his intellect. Ask him when I committed the theft.\" The wal\u00ed did so, and the simpleton answered, \"It was the evening of that night when it rained broiled fish and ready-cooked flesh.\" On hearing this, \"Wretch!\" exclaimed the wal\u00ed in a fury, \"dost thou dare to utter falsehoods before me? Who ever saw it rain anything but water?\" \"As I hope for life,\" replied the fool, \"I speak the truth; for my wife and myself ate of the fish and flesh which fell from the clouds.\" The woman, being appealed to, denied the assertion of her husband. The wal\u00ed, now convinced that the man\n\np.151\n\nwas crazy, released the woman, and sent her husband to the madhouse, where he remained for some days, till his wife, pitying his condition, contrived to get him set at liberty. She visited her husband, and counselled him, should any one ask him if he had seen it rain fish and flesh, to answer, \"No; who ever saw it rain anything but water?\" Then she informed the keeper that he was come to his senses, and suggested he should question him; and on the poor fellow answering properly he was released.\n\nIn a Russian variant, an old man had three sons, one of whom was a noodle. When the old man died, his property was shared between the brothers, but all that the simpleton received was one ox, which he took to the market to sell. On his way he chanced to pass an old birch-tree, which creaked and groaned in the wind. He thinks the tree is offering to buy his ox, and so he says, \"Well, you shall have it for twenty roubles.\" But the tree only creaked and creaked, and he fancied it was asking the ox on credit. \"Very good,\" says he. \"You'll pay me tomorrow? I'll wait till then.\" So he ties the ox to the tree and goes home. His brothers question him about his ox, and he tells them he has sold it for twenty roubles and is to get\n\np.152\n\nthe money to-morrow, at which they laugh; he is, they think; a greater fool than ever. Next morning he went to the birch-tree, and found the ox was gone, for, in truth, the wolves had eaten it. He demanded his money, but the tree only creaked and groaned, as usual. \"You'll pay me to-morrow?\" he exclaimed. \"That's what you said yesterday. I'll have no more of your promises.\" So saying, he struck the old birch-tree with his hatchet and sent the chips flying about. Now the tree was hollow, and it soon split asunder from his blows; and in the hollow trunk he found a pot full of gold, which some robbers had hidden there. Taking some of the gold, He returns home, and shows it to his brothers, who ask him how he got so much money. \"A neighbour,\" he replies, \"gave it to me for my ox. But this is nothing like the whole of it. Come along, brothers, and let us get the rest.\" They go, and fetch the rest of the treasure, and on their way home they meet a diachok (one of the inferior members of the Russian clerical body, though not one of the clergy), who asks them what they are carrying. \"Mushrooms,\" say the two clever brothers; but the noodle cries, \"That's not true; we're carrying money: here, look at it.\" The diachok, with an exclamation, flung himself upon the gold and began stuffing it into\n\np.153\n\nhis pockets. At this the noodle grew angry, dealt him a blow with his hatchet, and killed him on the spot. The brothers dragged the body to an empty cellar, and flung it in. Later in the evening the eldest said to the other, \"This business is sure to turn out badly. When they look for the diachok, Simpleton will be sure to tell them all about it. So we had better hide the body in some other place, and kill a goat and bury it in the cellar.\" This they did accordingly. And after several days had passed the people asked the noodle if he had seen the diachok. \"Yes,\" he answered. \"I killed him some time ago with my hatchet, and my brothers carried him to the cellar.\" They seize upon him and compel him to go down into the cellar and bring out the body. He gets hold of the goat's head, and asks, \"Was your diachok dark-haired?\" \"He was.\" \"Had he a beard?\" \"Yes.\" \"And horns?\" \"What horns are you talking of?\" \"Well, see for yourselves,\" said he, tossing up the head to them. They saw it was a goat's head, and went away home.[1]\n\nThe reader cannot fail to remark the close resemblance there is between the first parts\n\n[1] See Ralston's Russian Folk-Tales.\n\np.154\n\nof the Arabian and Russian storie; and the second parts of both reappear in many tales of the Silly Son. The goat's carcase substituted for the dead man occurs, for instance, in the Norse story of Silly Matt; in the Sicilian story of Giuf\u00e0; in M. Rivi\u00e8re's Contes Populates de la Kabylie du Djurdjura; and \"Foolish Sach\u00fali,\" in Miss Stokes' Indian Fairy Tales. The incident of the pretended shower of broiled fish and flesh is found in Campbell's Tales of the West Highlands (porridge and pancakes); in Rivi\u00e8re's Tales of the Kaba\u00efl (fritters); \"Foolish Sach\u00fali\" (sweetmeats); Giuf\u00e0, the Sicilian Booby (figs and raisins); and in M. Leger's Contes Populaires Slaves, where, curiously enough, the trick is played by a husband upon his wife. It is perhaps worth while reproducing the Russian story from Leger, in a somewhat abridged form, as follows:\n\nIn tilling the ground a labourer found a treasure, and carrying it home, said to his wife, \"See! Heaven has sent us a fortune. But where can we conceal it?\" She suggested he should bury it under the floor, which he did accordingly. Soon after this the wife went out to fetch water, and the labourer reflected that his wife was a dreadful gossip, and by to-morrow night all the village would know their secret. So he removed the\n\np.155\n\ntreasure from its hiding-place and buried it in his barn, beneath a heap of corn. When the wife came back from the well, he said to her quite gravely, \"To-morrow we shall go to the forest to seek fish; they say there's plenty there at present.\" \"What! fish in the forest?\" she exclaimed. \"Of course,\" he rejoined; \"and you'll see them there.\" Very early next morning he got up, and took some fish, which he had concealed in a basket. He went to the grocer's and bought a quantity of sweet cakes. He also caught a hare and killed it. The fish and cakes he disposed of in different parts of the wood, and the hare he hooked on a fishing-line, and then threw it in the river. After breakfast he took his wife with him into the wood, which they had scarcely entered when she found a pike, then a perch, and then a roach, on the ground. With many exclamations of surprise, she gathered up the fish and put them in her basket. Presently they came to a pear-tree, from the branches of which hung sweet cakes. \"See!\" she cried. \"Cakes on a pear-tree!\" \"Quite natural,\" replied he: \"it has rained cakes, and some have remained on this tree; travellers have picked up the rest.\" Continuing their way to the village, they passed near a stream. \"Wait a little,\" said the husband; \"I set my line early this morning, and I'll\n\np.156\n\nlook if anything is caught on it.\" He then pulled in the line, and behold, there was a hare hooked on to it! \"How extraordinary!\" cries the good wife--\"a hare in the water!'' \"Why,\" says he, \"don't you know there are hares in the water as well as rats?\" \"No, indeed, I knew it not.\" They now returned home, and the wife set about preparing all the nice eatables for supper. In a day or two the labourer found from the talk of his acquaintances that his finding the treasure was no secret in the village, and in less than a week he was summoned to the castle. \"Is it true,\" said the lord, \"that you have found a treasure?\" \"It is not true,\" was his reply. \"But your wife has told me all.\" \"My wife does not know what she says--she is mad, my lord.\" Hereupon the woman cries, \"It is the truth, my lord; he has found a treasure and buried it beneath the floor of our cottage.\" \"When?\" \"On the eve before the day we went into the forest to look for fish.\" \"What do you say?\" \"Yes; it was on the day that it rained cakes; we gathered a basketful of them, and coming home, my husband fished a fine hare out of the river.\" My lord declared the woman to be an idiot; nevertheless he caused his servants to search under the labourer's cottage floor, but nothing was found there, and so the shrewd fellow secured his treasure.\n\np.157\n\nThe silly son figures frequently in Indian story-books; sometimes a number of fools' exploits are strung together and ascribed to one individual, as in the tale of \"Foolish Sach\u00fali;\" but generally they are told as separate stories. The following adventure of Sach\u00fali is also found, in varied form, in Beschi's Gooroo Paramartan: One day Sach\u00fali climbed up a tree, and sat on a long branch, and began cutting off the branch between the tree and himself. A man passing by called to him, saying, \"What are you doing up there? You will be killed if you cut that branch off.\" \"What do you say?\" asked the booby, coming down. \"When shall I die?\" \"How can I tell?\" said the man. \"Let me go.\" \"I will not let you go until you tell me when I shall die.\" At last the man, in order to get rid of him, said, \"When you find a scarlet thread on your jacket, then you will die.\" After this Sach\u00fali went to the bazaar, and sat down by some tailors, and in throwing away shreds, a scarlet thread fell on his clothes. \"Now I shall die!\" exclaimed the fool. \"How do you know that?\" the tailors inquired, when he told them what the man had said about a scarlet thread, at which they all laughed. Nevertheless, Sach\u00fali went and dug a grave in the jungle and lay down in it.\n\np.158\n\nPresently a sepoy comes along, bearing a pot of ghi, or clarified butter, which he engages Sach\u00fali to carry for him, and the noodle, of course, lets it fall in the midst of his calculations of the uses to which he should put the money he is promised by the sepoy.\n\nThe incident of a blockhead cutting off the branch on which he is seated seems to be almost universal. It occurs in the jests of the typical Turkish noodle, the Khoja Nasr-ed-D\u00edn, and there exist German, Saxon, and Lithuanian variants of the same story. It is also known in Ceylon, and the following is a version from a Hind\u00fa work entitled Bhara-taka Dw\u00e1trinsati, Thirty-two Tales of Mendicant Monks:\n\nIn El\u00e1kapura there lived several mendicant monks. One of them, named Dandaka, once went, in the rainy season, into a wood in order to procure a post for his hut. There he saw on a tree a fine branch bent down, and he climbed the tree, sat on the branch, and began to cut it. Then there came that way some travellers, who, seeing what he was doing, said, \"O monk, greatest of all idiots, you should not cut a branch on which you yourself are sitting, for if you do so, when the branch breaks you will fall down and die.\" After saying this the travellers went their way. The monk, however, paid no\n\np.159\n\nattention to their speech, but continued to cut the branch, remaining in the same posture, until at length the branch broke, and he tumbled down. He then thought within himself, \"Those travellers are indeed wise and truthful, for everything has happened just as they predicted; consequently I must be dead.\" So he remained on the ground as if dead; he did not speak, nor did he stand up, nor did he even breathe. People who came there from the neighbourhood raised him up, but he did not stand; they endeavoured to make him speak, but could not succeed. They then sent word to the other monks, saying, \"Your associate Dandaka fell down from a tree and died.\" Then came the monks in large numbers, and when they saw that he was \"dead,\" they lifted him up in order to carry him to the place of cremation. Now when they had gone a short distance they came upon a spot where the road divided itself before them. Then said some, \"We must go to the left,\" but others said, \"It is to the right that we must go.\" Thus a dispute arose among them, and they were unable to come to any conclusion. The \"dead\" monk, who was borne on a bier, said, \"Friends, quarrel not among yourselves; when I was alive, I always went by the left road.\" Then said some, \"He always spoke the truth; all\n\np.160\n\nthat he ever said was nothing but the simple fact. Let us therefore take the left road.\" This was agreed upon, and as they were about to proceed towards the left some people who happened to be present said, \"O ye monks, ye are the greatest of all blockheads that ye should proceed to burn this man while he is yet alive.\" They answered, \"Nay, but he is dead.\" Then the bystanders said, \"He cannot be dead, seeing that he yet speaks.\" They then set down the bier on the ground, and Dandaka persistently declared that he was actually dead, and related to them with the most solemn protestations the prediction of the travellers, and how it was fulfilled. Hereupon the other monks remained quite bewildered, unable to arrive at any decision as to whether Dandaka was dead or alive, until at length, after a great deal of trouble, the bystanders succeeded in convincing them that the man was not dead and in inducing them to return to their dwelling. Dandaka also now stood up and went his way, after having been heartily laughed at by the people.[1]\n\nA diverting story in the Faceti\u0153 of Poggius, entitled \"Mortuus Loqueus,\" from which it was reproduced in the Italian novels of\n\n[1] From a paper on \"Comparative Folk-lore,\" by W. Goonetilleke, in The Oritntalist, i., p. 122.\n\np.161\n\nGrazzini and in our old collection Tales and Quicke Answeres, has a near affinity with jests of this class, and also with the wide cycle of stories in which a number of rogues combine to cheat a simpleton out of his property. In the early English jest-book,[1] it is, in effect, as follows:\n\nThere once dwelt in Florence a noodle called Nigniaca, upon whom a party of young men resolved to play a practical joke. Having arranged their plans, one of them met him early one morning, and asked him if he was not ill. \"No,\" says the wittol. \"I am well enough.\" \"By my faith,\" quoth the joker, \"but you have a pale, sickly colour,\" and went his way. Presently a second of the complotters came up to him, and asked him if he was not suffering from an ague, for he certainly looked very ill. The poor fellow now began to think that he was really sick, and was convinced of this when a third man in passing told him that he should be in his bed--he had evidently not an hour to live. Hearing this, Nigniaca stood stock-still, saying to himself, \"Verily, I have some sharp ague,\" when a fourth man came and bade him go home at once, for he was a dying man.\n\n[1] Mery Tales, Wittie Questions, and Quicke Answeres, very pleasant to be Readde. Imprinted at London by H. Wykes, 1567.\n\np.162\n\nSo the simpleton begged this fourth man to help him home, which he did very willingly, and after laying him in his bed, the other jokers came to see him, and one of them, pretending to be a physician, felt his pulse and declared the patient would die within an hour.[1] Then, standing all about his bed, they said to each other, \"Now he is sinking fast; his speech and sight have failed him; he will soon give up the ghost. Let us therefore close his eyes, cross his hands on his breast, and carry him forth to be buried.\" The simpleton lay as still as though he was really dead, so they laid him on a bier and carried him through the city. A great crowd soon gathered, when it was known that they were carrying the corpse of Nigniaca to his grave. And among the crowd was a taverner's boy, who cried out, \"What a rascal and thief\n\n[1] Thus, too, Scogin and his \"chamber-fellow\" successively declared to a rustic that the sheep he was driving were pigs. In Fortini's novels, in like manner, a simpleton is persuaded that the kid he offered for sale was a capon; and in the Spanish El Conde Lucanor, and the German Tyl Eulenspiegel, a countryman is cheated out of a piece of cloth. The original form of the incident is found in the Hitopadesa, where three sharpers persuade a Br\u00e1hman that the goat he is carrying for a sacrifice is a dog. This story of the Florentine noodle--or rather Poggio's version--may have been suggested by a tale in the\n\np.163\n\nis dead! By the mass, he should have been hanged long ago.\" When the wittol heard himself thus vilified, he lifted up his head and exclaimed, \"I wish, you scoundrel, I were alive now, as I am dead, and I would prove thee a false liar to thy face;\" upon which the jokers burst into laughter, set down the \"body\" and ran away--leaving Nigniaca to explain the whole affair to the marvelling multitude.[1]\n\nWe read of another silly son, in the Kath\u00e1 Manjari, whose father said to him one day, \"My boy, you are now grown big, yet you\n\nGesta Romanorum, in which the emperor's physician is made to believe that he had leprosy. See my Popular Tales and Fictions, where these and similar stories are compared in a paper entitled \"The Sharpers and the Simpleton.\"\n\n[1] In Powell and Magnusson's Legends of Iceland (Second Series, p. 627), a woman makes her husband believe that he is dressed in fine clothes when he is naked; another persuades her husband that he is dead, and as he is being carried to the burying-ground, he perceives the naked man, who asserts that he is dressed, upon which he exclaims, \"How I should laugh if I were not dead!\" And in a fabliau by Jean de Boves, \"Le Villain de Bailleul; ali\u00e0s, Le Femme qui fit croire \u00e0 son Mari qu'il \u00e9tait mort,\" the husband exclaims, \"Rascal of a priest, you may well thank Heaven that I am dead, else I would belabour you soundly with my stick.\"--See M. Le Grand's Fabliaux, ed. 1781, tome v., pp. 192, 193.\n\np.164\n\ndon't seem to have much sense. You must, however, do something for your living. Go, therefore, to the tank, and catch fish and bring them home.\" The lad accordingly went to the tank, and having caused all the water--which was required for the irrigation of his father's fields--to run to waste, he picked up from the mud all the fishes he could find, and took them to his father, not a little proud of his exploit.--In the Kath\u00e1 Sarit S\u00e1gara it is related that a Brahman told his foolish son one evening that he must send him to the village early on the morrow, and thither the lad went, without asking what he was to do. Returning home at night very tired, he said to his father, \"I have been to the village.\" \"Yes,\" said the Brahman, \"you went thither without an object, and have done no good by it.\"--And in the Buddhist J\u00e1takas we find what is probably the original of a world-wide story: A man was chopping a felled tree, when a mosquito settled on his bald head and stung him severely. Calling to his son, who was sitting near him, he said, \"My boy, there is a mosquito stinging my head, like the thrust of a spear--drive it off.\" \"Wait a bit, father.\" said the boy, \"and I will kill him with one blow.\" Then he took up an axe and stood behind his father's back; and thinking to kill the mosquito with the axe, he only killed his father.\n\np.165\n\nAmong numerous variants is the story of the Sicilian booby, Giuf\u00e0, who was annoyed by the flies, and complained of them to the judge, who told him that he was at liberty to kill a fly wherever he saw it: just then a fly happened to alight on the judge's nose, which Giuf\u00e0 observing, he immediately aimed at it so furious a blow with his fist, that he smashed his worship's nose!\n\nThe hopelessness of attempting to impart instruction to the silly son is farther illustrated by the story in a Sinhalese collection: A g\u00far\u00fa was engaged in teaching one of his disciples, but whilst he was teaching the youth was watching the movements of a rat which was entering its hole. As soon as the g\u00far\u00fa had finished his teaching, he said, \"Well, my son, has all entered in?\" to which the youth replied, \"Yes, all has entered in except the tail.\" And from the same work is the following choice example of \"a happy family\": A priest went one day to the house of one of his followers, and amongst other things he said, \"Tell me now, which of your four children is the best-behaved?\" The father replied, \"Look, sir, at that boy who has climbed to the top of that thatched building, and is waving aloft a firebrand. Among them all, he is the divinely excellent one.\" Whereupon the priest placed his finger on his nose,\n\np.166\n\ndrew a deep, deep sigh, and said, \"Is it indeed so? What, then, must the other three be?\"\n\nThe Turkish romance of the Forty Vazirs--the plan of which is similar to that of the Book of Sindib\u00e1d and its derivatives--furnishes us with two stories of the same class, one of which is as follows, according to my friend Mr. Gibb's complete translation (the first that has been made in English), recently published:[1]\n\nThey have told that in bygone times there was a king, and he had a skilful minstrel. One day a certain person gave to the latter a little boy, that he might teach him the science of music. The boy abode a long time by him, and though the master instructed him, he succeeded not in learning, and the master could make nothing of him. He arranged a scale, and said, \"Whatsoever thou sayest to me, say in this scale.\" So whatsoever the boy said he used to say in that scale. Now one day a spark of fire fell on the master's turban. The boy saw it and chanted, \"O master, I see something; shall I say it or no?\" and he went over the whole scale. Then the master\n\n[1] History of the Forty Viziers; or, The Forty Morns and Forty Eves. Translated from the Turkish, by E.J.W. Gibb, M.R.A.S. London: G. Redway, 1886.\n\np.167\n\nchanted, \"O boy, what dost thou see? Speak!\" and he too went over all that the boy had gone over. Then the turn came to the boy, and he chanted, \"O master, a spark has fallen on thy turban, and it is burning.\" The master straightway tore off his turban and cast it on the ground, and saw that it was burning. He blew out the fire on this side and on that, and took it in his hand, and said to the boy, \"What time for chanting is this? Everything is good in its own place,\" and he admonished him.[1]\n\nThe other story tells how a king had a stupid son, and placed him in charge of a cunning master, learned in the sciences, who declared it would be easy for him to teach the boy discretion, and, before dismissing him, the king gave the sage many rich gifts. After the boy has been long under the tuition of his learned master, the latter, conceiving\n\n[1] A variant of this is found in John Bromyard's Summa Pr\u0153dicantium, A 26, 34, as follows:\n\nQuidam sedebat juxta igneum, cujus vestem ignis intrabat. Dixit socius suus, \"Vis audire rumores?\" \"Ita,\" inquit, \"bonos et non alios.\" Cui alius,.\"Nescio nisi malos.\" \"Ergo,\" inquit, \"nolo audire.\" Et quum bis aut ter ei hoc diceret, semper idem respondit. In fine, quum sentiret vestem combustam, iratus ait socio, \"Quare non dixisti mihi?\" \"Quia (inquit) dixista quod noluisti audire rumores nisi placentes et illi non erant tales.\"\n\np.168\n\nhim to be well versed in all the sciences, takes him to the king, his father, who says to him, \"O my son, were I to hold a certain thing hidden in my hand, couldst thou tell me what it is?\" \"Yes,\" answers the youth. Upon this the king secretly slips the ring off his finger, and hides it in his hand, and then asks the boy, \"What have I in my hand?\" Quoth the clever youth, \"O father, it first came from the hills.\" (The king thinks to himself, \"He knows that mines are in the hills.\") \"And it is a round thing,\" continues he--\"it must be a millstone.\" \"Blockhead!\" exclaims the irate king, \"could a millstone be hidden in a man's hand?\" Then addressing the learned man, \"Take him away,\" he says, \"and teach him.\"\n\nLastly, we have a somewhat different specimen of the silly son in the doctor's apprentice, whose attempt to imitate his master was so ludicrously unsuccessful. He used to accompany his master on his visits to patients, and one day the doctor said to a sick man, to whom he had been called, \"I know what is the matter with you, and it is useless to deny it;--you have been eating beans.\" On their way home, the apprentice, admiring his master's sagacity, begged to be informed how he knew that the patient had been eating beans. \"Boy,\" said the doctor,\n\np.169\n\nloftily, \"I drew an inference.\" \"An inference!\" echoed this youth of inquiring mind; \"and what is an inference?\" Quoth the doctor, \"Listen: when we came to the door, I observed the shells of beans lying about, and I drew the inference that the family had had beans for dinner.\" Another day it chanced that the doctor did not take his apprentice with him when he went his rounds, and in his absence a message came for him to visit a person who had been taken suddenly ill. \"Here,\" thought the apprentice, \"is a chance for my putting master's last lesson into practice;\" so off he went to the sick man, and assuming as \"knowing\" an air as he could, he felt his pulse, and then said to him severely, \"Don't deny it; I see by your pulse that you have been eating a horse. I shall send you some medicine.\" When the doctor returned home he inquired of his hopeful pupil, whether any person had called for him, upon which the wittol proudly told him of his own exploit. \"Eaten a horse!\" exclaimed the man of physic. \"In the name of all that's wonderful, what induced you to say such a thing?\" Quoth the youth, simpering, \"Why, sir, I did as you did the other day, when we visited the old farmer--I drew an inference.\" \"You drew an inference, did you? And how did you draw the inference that the man had\n\np.170\n\neaten a horse?\" \"Why, very readily, sir; for as I entered the house I saw a saddle hanging on the wall.\"[1]Embed"}, {"_type": "song",
