headphones on\nWriting raps to any old beats\nLittle older now i see\nHow  big  that dream could be\nWanna say what I feel and rap from the heart\nChange the world cause god chose me\nLast week at one of my shows\nLittle boy bout 6 years old\nWalked up to me, at a bully rally\nWith a story that he told he said\nMy name is Sebastian\nAnd I love what you do\nYour raps are tight your dance is sick\nWhen I grow up I wanna be like you\nThe kids at school they pick on me because I lik\u0435 to sing\nI said you were meant to fly don't l\u0435t anybody clip your wings\nHe had me sign his arm and said he'd never wash it away\nI'll never forget the look on his face or the way that I felt that day\nFollow me\nLook up in the sky and believe\nYou can be who you want and we can do the impossible\nDon't nobody hold you down or keep your feet on the ground\nWe can fly away, alway, alway, alway yeah, fly away yeah, away, away, away\n\n\nOne of my first letters\nCame from across the sea\nEnvelope was a little torn\nI'm surprised that it got to me\nI opened it and and read it\nAnd it brought tears to my eyes\nIt was the first time anything id read\nHad ever made me cry\nShe said my name is lee\nAnd South Korea is where I live\nI'm a big fan of your music\nThere's nothing I wouldn't give\nTo meet my inspiration\nThe boy who saved my life\nI've seen a lot of darkness\nAnd It was hard to see the light\nMy moms an alcoholic\nAnd I dont have many friends\nCouple weeks ago couldn't take no more  just wanted it all to end\nBut instead your music reached me\nAnd I stood back up to fight\nYou're my guardian angel\nYou helped me shine my light\nYou might also likeFollow me\nLook up in the sky and believe\nYou can be who you want and we can do the impossible\nDon't nobody hold

you dream there are no limits\nAnd theres nothing to hold you down\nImagine the possibilities with faith you'd never fail\nYou'd step without no hesitation\nImpossible then prevails\nSometimes you may be lost\nAnd your futures outta site\nWell follow me look up in the sky\nHe's shining down his light\nAnd his dreams are far more bigger\nThan the could ever see\nAnd everything is possible for one who just believes\nLord, take these broken wings so we can learn to fly again\nThere's hope in the future\nNot the darkness where we've been\nYou can say that i'm a dreamer\nBut i'm not the only one\nA voice for my generation\nOne people under one\nFollow me\nLook up in the sky and believe\nYou can be who you want and we can do the impossible\nDon't nobody hold you down or keep your feet on

1: Bryson Tiller]\nI tell 'em, \"Now go and throw your hands up for some real talent\"\nHaters try and throw a nigga off but I'm still balanced\nThey say don't act a fool at the top, I can care

just hope it doesn't lose me\n'Cause reception in my city is terrible, no one knew me\nFrom the start but that subject is changing in the end\nMy grandma's two cents was to change all my friends\nI agree, some of my niggas think my flame is for them\nAnd the bitches think that every song I sang is for them\nThat's a lie, I advise quitting school ain't your best move\n'Cause everywhere you go, someone gonna test you\nAnd I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit\nYou know we killing this shit like we should bitch\nYeah\n[Chorus: MVP]\nUh, they be telling me stop wasting my time\n'Cause ain't nobody made it out of the 'Ville (The 'Ville)\nYeah but I'ma keep on grinding on this music\nDropping bangers until I get a deal (Deal)\nAnd they say they ain't hating on my shit\nWhen they say quit and they just keeping it real (Real)\nAnd I'm glad 'cause they think I won't (Won't)\nBut I ain't hearing that, baby we will (We will, yeah)\nShow these lame niggas how to get into the game right now\nWe

go and clap your hands for me\nNeed the mixtape, then go-go super saiyan for me\nReal recognize real, you don't look that familiar\nEarn your wings then you can diss me 'till he caterpillar\nThat bitch can't break my heart, she finally know the reason\n'Cause I don't let these hoes offend me, I got hella defense\nIndustry hiding from me and I really hate this game\nI don't mind seeking but these locals tryna do the same\nI tell a whack nigga he whack so wack niggas don't like me\nThese days the term \"realest\" used real lightly\nYoung Envy with me, and he know what I mean\nTweedle bomb and shut a nigga down if he disagree\nOn everything I love, I do this for my city\nAnd if a nigga killin' me, I'm taking him down with me (What's up?)\nAnd I'm Ray Charles to the foolishness\nI only

his woman\nAnd he is your man\nWhen you're looking for roses\nThere are thorns you will meet\nAnd remember my child\nWithout any thorns the rose can't be sweet\nWell it's finally happened\nNow it's my

my share of tears\nI've had my share of rain\nBut after the storm\nNo rain will appear\nI just know when you hold me\nMy whole world is complete\nAnd the lesson is clear\nWithout any thorns the rose

down the block\nThat you've been chasin' the rock, chasin' that rock\nAnd if you don't give it up, you might be in for a shock\n[Verse 1]\nHomeboy had a good job, his bed was laid\nA pretty young wife, man, he had it made\nHis two little kids, they were the apple of his eye\nYou know he had it all together, I tell you no lie\nOne night in a club, in a moment of weakness\nHe met a real fine dame, she said her name was P\u0435aches\nThey went ov\u0435r to her house and she pulled out a pipe\nAnd ever since then my man just hasn't been right\nHe missed days from the job, neglecting his rent\nStarted smelling funky everywhere he went\nNow his two little kids, they even know what's up\nThey just look at their dad, and say \"D, what's up?\"\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 2]\nHomegirl's got her welfare check\nAnd it's just about enough to cover the rent\nBut she went over to her friend's house and took one hit\nAnd now she wonders where her money went\nShe couldn't afford food for the kids to eat\nShe couldn't afford shoes to put on their feet\nBut she told her grandmama she was going out to shop\nAnd all night long she was hitting that rock\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\n[?] He smoked his whole check\nAnd now it's all gone and he's getting depressed\nHe didn't think about his bills at all this week\nSo they turned off his gas and electricity\nNow he's thinking about how he can buy himself more\nHe's down on his knees, looking for pieces on the floor\nYou know the sweetness of life is what he really should be tasting\nInstead of wasting his life always chasing and basing\nDo you wanna go up, do you wanna go down\nWhen you fool with that rock you mess your whole life around\nNow if you ever ever dreamed about making it to the top\nYou're never gonna make it if you're chasing that rock\n\n[Chorus]\n\nHe's just-a chasing, he's just a-basing\nHe's just-a chasing, he's just a-basing\n\n[Verse 4]\nTake a look at your face, take a look at your face\nIt's all broken out and you're losing weight\nTake a look at your face, just take a look at your face\nYou know you just can't win when you mess with that base\n[Chorus: x2]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/1159087", "artist_names": "Ed Ames", "full_title": "Who Will Answer? by\u00a0Ed\u00a0Ames",

LyricsHallelujah! Hallelujah!, Hallelujah!\n\nFrom the canyons of the mind\nWe wander on and stumble blindly\nThrough the often-tangled maze\nOf starless nights and sunless days\nWhile asking for some kind of clue\nOr road to lead us to the truth\nBut who will answer?\n\nSide by side two people stand\nTogether vowing, hand-in-hand\nThat love's imbedded in their hearts\nBut soon an empty feeling starts\nTo overwhelm their hollow lives\nAnd when they seek the hows and whys\nWho will answer?\nOn a strange and distant hill\nA young man's lying very still\nHis arms will never hold his child\nBecause a bullet running wild\nHas struck him down. And now we cry\n\"Dear God, Oh, why, oh, why?\"\nBut who will answer?\n\nHigh upon a lonely ledge\nA figure teeters near the edge\nAnd jeering crowds collect below\nTo egg him on with, \"Go, man, go!\"\nBut who will ask what led him\nTo his private day of doom\nAnd who will answer?\n\n(Chorus)\nIf the soul is darkened\nBy a fear it cannot name\nIf the mind is baffled\nWhen the rules don't fit the game\nWho will answer? Who will answer? Who will answer?\nHallelujah! Hallelujah!, Hallelujah!\n\nIn the rooms of dark and shades\nThe scent of sandalwood pervades\nThe colored thoughts in muddled heads\nReclining in the rumpled beds\nOf unmade dreams that can't come true\nAnd when we ask what we should do\nWho...

Who will answer? Who will answer?\nHallelujah!

you do\n\n[Bridge]\nAll I want to do is take care of you\nEverything I have in my life, I'll share with you\nThis soul of mine has been possessed by you\nDarling, my heart has been obsessed with you\nJust look at me\nI'm not the man I used to be\n\n[Verse 3]\nI used to be proud, I used to be strong\nBut all of that's changed, girl, since you've come along\nYour lovin' sweetness is my

That's a rumor.\n\n\nDo these look like rumors?\n\n\nThat's a conspiracy theory.\nThese are obviously doctored photos.\n\n\nHow did you get mixed up in this?\n\n\nHe's been talking to humans.\n\n\n- What?\n- Talking to humans?!\n\n\nHe has a human girlfriend.\nAnd they make out!\n\n\nMake out?

They put it\nin lip balm for no reason whatsoever!\n\n\nEven if it's true, what can one bee do?\n\n\nSting them where it really hurts.\n\n\nIn the face! The eye!\n\n\n- That would hurt.\n- No.\n\n\nUp the nose? That's a killer.\n\n\nThere's only one place you can sting\nthe humans, one place where it matters.\n\n\nHive at Five, the hive's only\nfull-hour action news source.\n\n\nNo more bee beards!\n\n\nWith Bob Bumble at the anchor desk.\n\n\nWeather with Storm Stinger.\n\n\nSports with Buzz Larvi.\n\n\nAnd Jeanette Ohung.\n\n\n- Good evening.

I can't do this\"?\n\n\nBees have never been afraid\nto change the world.\n\n\nWhat about Bee Oolumbus?\nBee Gandhi? Bejesus?\n\n\nWhere I'm from, we'd never sue humans.\n\n\nWe were thinking\nof stickball or candy stores.\n\n\nHow old are you?\n\n\nThe bee community\nis supporting you in this case,\n\n\nwhich will be the trial\nof the bee century.\n\n\nYou know, they have a Larry King\nin the human world too.\n\n\nIt's a common name. Next week...\n\n\nHe looks like you and has a show\nand suspenders and colored dots...\n\n\nNext week...\n\n\nGlasses, quotes on the bottom from the\nguest even though you just heard 'em.\n\n\nBear Week next week!\nThey're scary, hairy and here live.\n\n\nAlways leans forward, pointy shoulders,\nsquinty eyes, very Jewish.\n\n\nIn tennis, you attack\nat the point of weakness!\n\n\nIt was my grandmother, Ken. She's 81.\n\n\nHoney, her backhand's a joke!\nI'm not gonna take advantage of that?\n\n\nQuiet, please.\nActual work going on here.\n\n\n- Is that that same bee?\n- Yes, it is!\n\n\nI'm helping him sue the human race.\n\n\n- Hello.\n- Hello, bee.\n\n\nThis is Ken.\n\n\nYeah, I remember you. Timberland, size\nten and a half. Vibram sole, I believe.\n\n\nWhy does he talk again?\n\n\nListen, you better go\n'cause we're really busy working.\n\n\nBut it's our yogurt night!\n\n\nBye-bye.\n\n\nWhy is yogurt night so difficult?!\n\n\nYou poor thing.\nYou two have been at this for hours!\n\n\nYes, and Adam here\nhas been a huge help.\n\n\n- Frosting...\n- How many sugars?\n\n\nJust one. I try not\nto use the competition.\n\n\nSo why are you helping me?\n\n\nBees have good qualities.\n\n\nAnd it takes my mind off the shop.\n\n\nInstead of flowers, people\nare giving balloon bouquets now.\n\n\nThose are great, if you're three.\n\n\nAnd artificial flowers.\n\n\n- Oh, those just get me psychotic!\n- Yeah, me too.\n\n\nBent stingers, pointless pollination.\n\n\nBees must hate those fake things!\n\n\nNothing worse\nthan a daffodil that's had work done.\n\n\nMaybe this could make up\nfor it a little bit.\n\n\n- This lawsuit's a pretty big deal.\n- I guess.\n\n\nYou sure you want to go through with it?\n\n\nAm I sure? When I'm done with\nthe humans, they won't be able\n\n\nto say, \"Honey, I'm home,\"\nwithout paying a royalty!\n\n\nIt's an incredible scene\nhere in downtown Manhattan,\n\n\nwhere the world anxiously waits,\nbecause for the first time in history,\n\n\nwe will hear for ourselves\nif a honeybee can actually speak.\n\n\nWhat have we gotten into here, Barry?\n\n\nIt's pretty big, isn't it?\n\n\nI can't believe how many humans\ndon't work during the day.\n\n\nYou think billion-dollar multinational\nfood companies have good lawyers?\n\n\nEverybody needs to stay\nbehind the barricade.\n\n\n- What's the matter?\n- I don't know, I just got a chill.\n\n\nWell, if it isn't the bee team.\n\n\nYou boys work on this?\n\n\nAll rise! The Honorable\nJudge Bumbleton presiding.\n\n\nAll right. Case number 4475,\n\n\nSuperior Court of New York,\nBarry Bee Benson v. the Honey Industry\n\n\nis now in session.\n\n\nMr. Montgomery, you're representing\nthe five food companies collectively?\n\n\nA privilege.\n\n\nMr. Benson... you're representing\nall the bees of the world?\n\n\nI'm kidding. Yes, Your Honor,\nwe're ready to proceed.\n\n\nMr. Montgomery,\nyour opening statement, please.\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen of the jury,\n\n\nmy grandmother was a simple woman.\n\n\nBorn on a farm, she believed\nit was man's divine right\n\n\nto benefit from the bounty\nof nature God put before us.\n\n\nIf we lived in the topsy-turvy world\nMr. Benson imagines,\n\n\njust think of what would it mean.\n\n\nI would have to negotiate\nwith the silkworm\n\n\nfor the elastic in my britches!\n\n\nTalking bee!\n\n\nHow do we know this isn't some sort of\n\n\nholographic motion-picture-capture\nHollywood wizardry?\n\n\nThey could be using laser beams!\n\n\nRobotics! Ventriloquism!\nOloning! For all we know,\n\n\nhe could be on steroids!\n\n\nMr. Benson?\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\nthere's no trickery here.\n\n\nI'm just an ordinary bee.\nHoney's pretty important to me.\n\n\nIt's important to all bees.\nWe invented it!\n\n\nWe make it. And we protect it\nwith our lives.\n\n\nUnfortunately, there are\nsome people in this room\n\n\nwho think they can take it from us\n\n\n'cause we're the little guys!\nI'm hoping that, after this is all over,\n\n\nyou'll see how, by taking our honey,\nyou not only take everything we have\n\n\nbut everything we are!\n\n\nI wish he'd dress like that\nall the time. So nice!\n\n\nCall your first witness.\n\n\nSo, Mr. Klauss Vanderhayden\nof Honey Farms, big company you have.\n\n\nI suppose so.\n\n\nI see you also own\nHoneyburton and Honron!\n\n\nYes, they provide beekeepers\nfor our farms.\n\n\nBeekeeper. I find that\nto be a very disturbing term.\n\n\nI don't imagine you employ\nany bee-free-ers, do you?\n\n\n- No.\n- I couldn't hear you.\n\n\n- No.\n- No.\n\n\nBecause you don't free bees.\nYou keep bees. Not only that,\n\n\nit seems you thought a bear would be\nan appropriate image for a jar of honey.\n\n\nThey're very lovable creatures.\n\n\nYogi Bear, Fozzie Bear, Build-A-Bear.\n\n\nYou mean like this?\n\n\nBears kill bees!\n\n\nHow'd you like his head crashing\nthrough your living room?!\n\n\nBiting into your couch!\nSpitting out your throw pillows!\n\n\nOK, that's enough. Take him away.\n\n\nSo, Mr. Sting, thank you for being here.\nYour name intrigues me.\n\n\n- Where have I heard it before?\n- I was with a band called The Police.\n\n\nBut you've never been\na police officer, have you?\n\n\nNo, I haven't.\n\n\nNo, you haven't. And so here\nwe have yet another example\n\n\nof bee culture casually\nstolen by a human\n\n\nfor nothing more than\na prance-about stage name.\n\n\nOh, please.\n\n\nHave you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?\n\n\nBecause I'm feeling\na little stung, Sting.\n\n\nOr should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!\n\n\nThat's not his real name?! You idiots!\n\n\nMr. Liotta, first,\nbelated congratulations on\n\n\nyour Emmy win for a guest spot\non ER in 2005.\n\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\n\nI see from your resume\nthat you're devilishly handsome\n\n\nwith a churning inner turmoil\nthat's ready to blow.\n\n\nI enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?\n\n\nNot yet it isn't. But is this\nwhat it's come to for you?\n\n\nExploiting tiny, helpless bees\nso you don't\n\n\nhave to rehearse\nyour part and learn your lines, sir?\n\n\nWatch it, Benson!\nI could blow right now!\n\n\nThis isn't a goodfella.\nThis is a badfella!\n\n\nWhy doesn't someone just step on\nthis creep, and we can all go home?!\n\n\n- Order in this court!\n- You're all thinking it!\n\n\nOrder! Order, I say!\n\n\n- Say it!\n- Mr. Liotta, please sit down!\n\n\nI think it was awfully nice\nof that bear to pitch in like that.\n\n\nI think the jury's on our side.\n\n\nAre we doing everything right, legally?\n\n\nI'm a florist.\n\n\nRight. Well, here's to a great team.\n\n\nTo a great team!\n\n\nWell, hello.\n\n\n- Ken!\n- Hello.\n\n\nI didn't think you were coming.\n\n\nNo, I was just late.\nI tried to call, but... the battery.\n\n\nI didn't want all this to go to waste,\nso I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.\n\n\nOh, that was lucky.\n\n\nThere's a little left.\nI could heat it up.\n\n\nYeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.\n\n\nSo I hear you're quite a tennis player.\n\n\nI'm not much for the game myself.\nThe ball's a little grabby.\n\n\nThat's where I usually sit.\nRight... there.\n\n\nKen, Barry was looking at your resume,\n\n\nand he agreed with me that eating with\nchopsticks isn't really a special skill.\n\n\nYou think I don't see what you're doing?\n\n\nI know how hard it is to find\nthe rightjob. We have that in common.\n\n\nDo we?\n\n\nBees have 100 percent employment,\nbut we do jobs like taking the crud out.\n\n\nThat's just what\nI was thinking about doing.\n\n\nKen, I let Barry borrow your razor\nfor his fuzz. I hope that was all right.\n\n\nI'm going to drain the old stinger.\n\n\nYeah, you do that.\n\n\nLook at that.\n\n\nYou know, I've just about had it\n\n\nwith your little mind games.\n\n\n- What's that?\n- Italian Vogue.\n\n\nMamma mia, that's a lot of pages.\n\n\nA lot of ads.\n\n\nRemember what Van said, why is\nyour life more valuable than mine?\n\n\nFunny, I just can't seem to recall that!\n\n\nI think something stinks in here!\n\n\nI love the smell of flowers.\n\n\nHow do you like the smell of flames?!\n\n\nNot as much.\n\n\nWater bug! Not taking sides!\n\n\nKen, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!\nThis is pathetic!\n\n\nI've got issues!\n\n\nWell, well, well, a royal flush!\n\n\n- You're bluffing.\n- Am I?\n\n\nSurf's up, dude!\n\n\nPoo water!\n\n\nThat bowl is gnarly.\n\n\nExcept for those dirty yellow rings!\n\n\nKenneth! What are you doing?!\n\n\nYou know, I don't even like honey!\nI don't eat it!\n\n\nWe need to talk!\n\n\nHe's just a little bee!\n\n\nAnd he happens to be\nthe nicest bee I've met in a long time!\n\n\nLong time? What are you talking about?!\nAre there other bugs in your life?\n\n\nNo, but there are other things bugging\nme in life. And you're one of them!\n\n\nFine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...\n\n\nMy nerves are fried from riding\non this emotional roller coaster!\n\n\nGoodbye, Ken.\n\n\nAnd for your information,\n\n\nI prefer sugar-free, artificial\nsweeteners made by man!\n\n\nI'm sorry about all that.\n\n\nI know it's got\nan aftertaste! I like it!\n\n\nI always felt there was some kind\nof barrier between Ken and me.\n\n\nI couldn't overcome it.\nOh, well.\n\n\nAre you OK for the trial?\n\n\nI believe Mr. Montgomery\nis about out of ideas.\n\n\nWe would like to call\nMr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.\n\n\nGood idea! You can really see why he's\nconsidered one of the best lawyers...\n\n\nYeah.\n\n\nLayton, you've\ngotta weave some magic\n\n\nwith this jury,\nor it's gonna be all over.\n\n\nDon't worry. The only thing I have\nto do to turn this jury around\n\n\nis to remind them\nof what they don't like about bees.\n\n\n- You got the tweezers?\n- Are you allergic?\n\n\nOnly to losing, son. Only to losing.\n\n\nMr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you\nwhat I think we'd all like to know.\n\n\nWhat exactly is your relationship\n\n\nto that woman?\n\n\nWe're friends.\n\n\n- Good friends?\n- Yes.\n\n\nHow good? Do you live together?\n\n\nWait a minute...\n\n\nAre you her little...\n\n\n...bedbug?\n\n\nI've seen a bee documentary or two.\nFrom what I understand,\n\n\ndoesn't your queen give birth\nto all the bee children?\n\n\n- Yeah, but...\n- So those aren't your real parents!\n\n\n- Oh, Barry...\n- Yes, they are!\n\n\nHold me back!\n\n\nYou're an illegitimate bee,\naren't you, Benson?\n\n\nHe's denouncing bees!\n\n\nDon't y'all date your cousins?\n\n\n- Objection!\n- I'm going to pincushion this guy!\n\n\nAdam, don't! It's what he wants!\n\n\nOh, I'm hit!!\n\n\nOh, lordy, I am hit!\n\n\nOrder! Order!\n\n\nThe venom! The venom\nis coursing through my veins!\n\n\nI have been felled\nby a winged beast of destruction!\n\n\nYou see? You can't treat them\nlike equals! They're striped savages!\n\n\nStinging's the only thing\nthey know! It's their way!\n\n\n- Adam, stay with me.\n- I can't feel my legs.\n\n\nWhat angel of mercy\nwill come forward to suck the poison\n\n\nfrom my heaving buttocks?\n\n\nI will have order in this court. Order!\n\n\nOrder, please!\n\n\nThe case of the honeybees\nversus the human race\n\n\ntook a pointed turn against the bees\n\n\nyesterday when one of their legal\nteam stung Layton T. Montgomery.\n\n\n- Hey, buddy.\n- Hey.\n\n\n- Is there much pain?\n- Yeah.\n\n\nI...\n\n\nI blew the whole case, didn't I?\n\n\nIt doesn't matter. What matters is\nyou're alive. You could have died.\n\n\nI'd be better off dead. Look at me.\n\n\nThey got it from the cafeteria\ndownstairs, in a tuna sandwich.\n\n\nLook, there's\na little celery still on it.\n\n\nWhat was it like to sting someone?\n\n\nI can't explain it. It was all...\n\n\nAll adrenaline and then...\nand then ecstasy!\n\n\nAll right.\n\n\nYou think it was all a trap?\n\n\nOf course. I'm sorry.\nI flew us right into this.\n\n\nWhat were we thinking? Look at us. We're\njust a couple of bugs in this world.\n\n\nWhat will the humans do to us\nif they win?\n\n\nI don't know.\n\n\nI hear they put the roaches in motels.\nThat doesn't sound so bad.\n\n\nAdam, they check in,\nbut they don't check out!\n\n\nOh, my.\n\n\nOould you get a nurse\nto close that window?\n\n\n- Why?\n- The smoke.\n\n\nBees don't smoke.\n\n\nRight. Bees don't smoke.\n\n\nBees don't smoke!\nBut some bees are smoking.\n\n\nThat's it! That's our case!\n\n\nIt is? It's not over?\n\n\nGet dressed. I've gotta go somewhere.\n\n\nGet back to the court and stall.\nStall any way you can.\n\n\nAnd assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub.\n\n\nMr. Flayman.\n\n\nYes? Yes, Your Honor!\n\n\nWhere is the rest of your team?\n\n\nWell, Your Honor, it's interesting.\n\n\nBees are trained to fly haphazardly,\n\n\nand as a result,\nwe don't make very good time.\n\n\nI actually heard a funny story about...\n\n\nYour Honor,\nhaven't these ridiculous bugs\n\n\ntaken up enough\nof this court's valuable time?\n\n\nHow much longer will we allow\nthese absurd shenanigans to go on?\n\n\nThey have presented no compelling\nevidence to support their charges\n\n\nagainst my clients,\nwho run legitimate businesses.\n\n\nI move for a complete dismissal\nof this entire case!\n\n\nMr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going\n\n\nto have to consider\nMr. Montgomery's motion.\n\n\nBut you can't! We have a terrific case.\n\n\nWhere is your proof?\nWhere is the evidence?\n\n\nShow me the smoking gun!\n\n\nHold it, Your Honor!\nYou want a smoking gun?\n\n\nHere is your smoking gun.\n\n\nWhat is that?\n\n\nIt's a bee smoker!\n\n\nWhat, this?\nThis harmless little contraption?\n\n\nThis couldn't hurt a fly,\nlet alone a bee.\n\n\nLook at what has happened\n\n\nto bees who have never been asked,\n\"Smoking or non?\"\n\n\nIs this what nature intended for us?\n\n\nTo be forcibly addicted\nto smoke machines\n\n\nand man-made wooden slat work camps?\n\n\nLiving out our lives as honey slaves\nto the white man?\n\n\n- What are we gonna do?\n- He's playing the species card.\n\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please,\nfree these bees!\n\n\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\n\n\nFree the bees!\n\n\nFree the bees! Free the bees!\n\n\nThe court finds in favor of the bees!\n\n\nVanessa, we won!\n\n\nI knew you could do it! High-five!\n\n\nSorry.\n\n\nI'm OK! You know what this means?\n\n\nAll the honey\nwill finally belong to the bees.\n\n\nNow we won't have\nto work so hard all the time.\n\n\nThis is an unholy perversion\nof the balance of nature, Benson.\n\n\nYou'll regret this.\n\n\nBarry, how much honey is out there?\n\n\nAll right. One at a time.\n\n\nBarry, who are you wearing?\n\n\nMy sweater is Ralph Lauren,\nand I have no pants.\n\n\n- What if Montgomery's right?\n- What do you mean?\n\n\nWe've been living the bee way\na long time, 27 million years.\n\n\nOongratulations on your victory.\nWhat will you demand as a settlement?\n\n\nFirst, we'll demand a complete shutdown\nof all bee work camps.\n\n\nThen we want back the honey\nthat was ours to begin with,\n\n\nevery last drop.\n\n\nWe demand an end to the glorification\nof the bear as anything more\n\n\nthan a filthy, smelly,\nbad-breath stink machine.\n\n\nWe're all aware\nof what they do in the woods.\n\n\nWait for my signal.\n\n\nTake him out.\n\n\nHe'll have nauseous\nfor a few hours, then he'll be fine.\n\n\nAnd we will no longer tolerate\nbee-negative nicknames...\n\n\nBut it's just a prance-about stage name!\n\n\n...unnecessary inclusion of honey\nin bogus health products\n\n\nand la-dee-da human\ntea-time snack garnishments.\n\n\nCan't breathe.\n\n\nBring it in, boys!\n\n\nHold it right there! Good.\n\n\nTap it.\n\n\nMr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups,\nand there's gallons more coming!\n\n\n- I think we need to shut down!\n- Shut down? We've never shut down.\n\n\nShut down honey production!\n\n\nStop making honey!\n\n\nTurn your key, sir!\n\n\nWhat do we do now?\n\n\nCannonball!\n\n\nWe're shutting honey production!\n\n\nMission abort.\n\n\nAborting pollination and nectar detail.\nReturning to base.\n\n\nAdam, you wouldn't believe\nhow much honey was out there.\n\n\nOh, yeah?\n\n\nWhat's going on? Where is everybody?\n\n\n- Are they out celebrating?\n- They're home.\n\n\nThey don't know what to do.\nLaying out, sleeping in.\n\n\nI heard your Uncle Carl was on his way\nto San Antonio with a cricket.\n\n\nAt least we got our honey back.\n\n\nSometimes I think, so what if humans\nliked our honey? Who wouldn't?\n\n\nIt's the greatest thing in the world!\nI was excited to be part of making it.\n\n\nThis was my new desk. This was my\nnew job. I wanted to do it really well.\n\n\nAnd now...\n\n\nNow I can't.\n\n\nI don't understand\nwhy they're not happy.\n\n\nI thought their lives would be better!\n\n\nThey're doing nothing. It's amazing.\nHoney really changes people.\n\n\nYou don't have any idea\nwhat's going on, do you?\n\n\n- What did you want to show me?\n- This.\n\n\nWhat happened here?\n\n\nThat is not the half of it.\n\n\nOh, no. Oh, my.\n\n\nThey're all wilting.\n\n\nDoesn't look very good, does it?\n\n\nNo.\n\n\nAnd whose fault do you think that is?\n\n\nYou know, I'm gonna guess bees.\n\n\nBees?\n\n\nSpecifically, me.\n\n\nI didn't think bees not needing to make\nhoney would affect all these things.\n\n\nIt's notjust flowers.\nFruits, vegetables, they all need bees.\n\n\nThat's our whole SAT test right there.\n\n\nTake away produce, that affects\nthe entire animal kingdom.\n\n\nAnd then, of course...\n\n\nThe human species?\n\n\nSo if there's no more pollination,\n\n\nit could all just go south here,\ncouldn't it?\n\n\nI know this is also partly my fault.\n\n\nHow about a suicide pact?\n\n\nHow do we do it?\n\n\n- I'll sting you, you step on me.\n- Thatjust kills you twice.\n\n\nRight, right.\n\n\nListen, Barry...\nsorry, but I gotta get going.\n\n\nI had to open my mouth and talk.\n\n\nVanessa?\n\n\nVanessa? Why are you leaving?\nWhere are you going?\n\n\nTo the final Tournament of Roses parade\nin Pasadena.\n\n\nThey've moved it to this weekend\nbecause all the flowers are dying.\n\n\nIt's the last chance\nI'll ever have to see it.\n\n\nVanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry.\nI never meant it to turn out like this.\n\n\nI know. Me neither.\n\n\nTournament of Roses.\nRoses can't do sports.\n\n\nWait a minute. Roses.

Just having some fun.\nEnjoy your flight.\n\n\nThen if we're lucky, we'll have\njust enough pollen to do the job.\n\n\nCan you believe how lucky we are? We\nhave just enough pollen to do the job!\n\n\nI think this is gonna work.\n\n\nIt's got to work.\n\n\nAttention, passengers,\nthis is Captain Scott.\n\n\nWe have a bit of bad weather\nin New York.\n\n\nIt looks like we'll experience\na couple hours delay.\n\n\nBarry, these are cut flowers\nwith no water. They'll never make it.\n\n\nI gotta get up there\nand talk to them.\n\n\nBe careful.\n\n\nCan I get help\nwith the Sky Mall magazine?\n\n\nI'd like to order the talking\ninflatable nose and ear hair trimmer.\n\n\nCaptain, I'm in a real situation.\n\n\n- What'd you say, Hal?\n- Nothing.\n\n\nBee!\n\n\nDon't freak out! My entire species...\n\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\n\n- Wait a minute! I'm an attorney!\n- Who's an attorney?\n\n\nDon't move.\n\n\nOh, Barry.\n\n\nGood afternoon, passengers.\nThis is your captain.\n\n\nWould a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B\nplease report to the cockpit?\n\n\nAnd please hurry!\n\n\nWhat happened here?\n\n\nThere was a DustBuster,\na toupee, a life raft exploded.\n\n\nOne's bald, one's in a boat,\nthey're both unconscious!\n\n\n- Is that another bee joke?\n- No!\n\n\nNo one's flying the plane!\n\n\nThis is JFK control tower, Flight 356.\nWhat's your status?\n\n\nThis is Vanessa Bloome.\nI'm a florist from New York.\n\n\nWhere's the pilot?\n\n\nHe's unconscious,\nand so is the copilot.\n\n\nNot good. Does anyone onboard\nhave flight experience?\n\n\nAs a matter of fact, there is.\n\n\n- Who's that?\n- Barry Benson.\n\n\nFrom the honey trial?! Oh, great.\n\n\nVanessa, this is nothing more\nthan a big metal bee.\n\n\nIt's got giant wings, huge engines.\n\n\nI can't fly a plane.\n\n\n- Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot?\n- Yes.\n\n\nHow hard could it be?\n\n\nWait, Barry!\nWe're headed into some lightning.\n\n\nThis is Bob Bumble. We have some\nlate-breaking news from JFK Airport,\n\n\nwhere a suspenseful scene\nis developing.\n\n\nBarry Benson,\nfresh from his legal victory...\n\n\nThat's Barry!\n\n\n...is attempting to land a plane,\nloaded with people, flowers\n\n\nand an incapacitated flight crew.\n\n\nFlowers?!\n\n\nWe have a storm in the area\nand two individuals at the controls\n\n\nwith absolutely no flight experience.\n\n\nJust a minute.\nThere's a bee on that plane.\n\n\nI'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson\nand his no-account compadres.\n\n\nThey've done enough damage.\n\n\nBut isn't he your only hope?\n\n\nTechnically, a bee\nshouldn't be able to fly at all.\n\n\nTheir wings are too small...\n\n\nHaven't we heard this a million times?\n\n\n\"The surface area of the wings\nand body mass make no sense.\"\n\n\n- Get this on the air!\n- Got it.\n\n\n- Stand by.\n- We're going live.\n\n\nThe way we work may be a mystery to you.\n\n\nMaking honey takes a lot of bees\ndoing a lot of small jobs.\n\n\nBut let me tell you about a small job.\n\n\nIf you do it well,\nit makes a big difference.\n\n\nMore than we realized.\nTo us, to everyone.\n\n\nThat's why I want to get bees\nback to working together.\n\n\nThat's the bee way!\nWe're not made of Jell-O.\n\n\nWe get behind a fellow.\n\n\n- Black and yellow!\n- Hello!\n\n\nLeft, right, down, hover.\n\n\n- Hover?\n- Forget hover.\n\n\nThis isn't so hard.\nBeep-beep! Beep-beep!\n\n\nBarry, what happened?!\n\n\nWait, I think we were\non autopilot the whole time.\n\n\n- That may have been helping me.\n- And now we're not!\n\n\nSo it turns out I cannot fly a plane.\n\n\nAll of you, let's get\nbehind this fellow! Move it out!\n\n\nMove out!\n\n\nOur only chance is if I do what I'd do,\nyou copy me with the wings of the plane!\n\n\nDon't have to yell.\n\n\nI'm not yelling!\nWe're in a lot of trouble.\n\n\nIt's very hard to concentrate\nwith that panicky tone in your voice!\n\n\nIt's not a tone. I'm panicking!\n\n\nI can't do this!\n\n\nVanessa, pull yourself together.\nYou have to snap out of it!\n\n\nYou snap out of it.\n\n\nYou snap out of it.\n\n\n- You snap out of it!\n- You snap out of it!\n\n\n- You snap out of it!\n- You snap out of it!\n\n\n- You snap out of it!\n- You snap out of it!\n\n\n- Hold it!\n- Why? Oome on, it's my turn.\n\n\nHow is the plane flying?\n\n\nI don't know.\n\n\nHello?\n\n\nBenson, got any flowers\nfor a happy occasion in there?\n\n\nThe Pollen Jocks!\n\n\nThey do get behind a fellow.\n\n\n- Black and yellow.\n- Hello.\n\n\nAll right, let's drop this tin can\non the blacktop.\n\n\nWhere? I can't see anything. Can you?\n\n\nNo, nothing. It's all cloudy.\n\n\nOome on. You got to think bee, Barry.\n\n\n- Thinking bee.\n- Thinking bee.\n\n\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\n\nWait a minute.\nI think I'm feeling something.\n\n\n- What?\n- I don't know. It's strong, pulling me.\n\n\nLike a 27-million-year-old instinct.\n\n\nBring the nose down.\n\n\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\n\n- What in the world is on the tarmac?\n- Get some lights on that!\n\n\nThinking bee!\nThinking bee! Thinking bee!\n\n\n- Vanessa, aim for the flower.\n- OK.\n\n\nOut the engines. We're going in\non bee power. Ready, boys?\n\n\nAffirmative!\n\n\nGood. Good. Easy, now. That's it.\n\n\nLand on that flower!\n\n\nReady? Full reverse!\n\n\nSpin it around!\n\n\n- Not that flower! The other one!\n- Which one?\n\n\n- That flower.\n- I'm aiming at the flower!\n\n\nThat's a fat guy in a flowered shirt.\nI mean the giant pulsating flower\n\n\nmade of millions of bees!\n\n\nPull forward. Nose down. Tail up.\n\n\nRotate around it.\n\n\n- This is insane, Barry!\n- This's the only way I know how to fly.\n\n\nAm I koo-koo-kachoo, or is this plane\nflying in an insect-like pattern?\n\n\nGet your nose in there. Don't be afraid.\nSmell it. Full reverse!\n\n\nJust drop it. Be a part of it.\n\n\nAim for the center!\n\n\nNow drop it in! Drop it in, woman!\n\n\nOome on, already.\n\n\nBarry, we did it!\nYou taught me how to fly!\n\n\n- Yes. No high-five!\n- Right.\n\n\nBarry, it worked!\nDid you see the giant flower?\n\n\nWhat giant flower? Where? Of course\nI saw the flower! That was genius!\n\n\n- Thank you.\n- But we're not done yet.\n\n\nListen, everyone!\n\n\nThis runway is covered\nwith the last pollen\n\n\nfrom the last flowers\navailable anywhere on Earth.\n\n\nThat means this is our last chance.\n\n\nWe're the only ones who make honey,\npollinate flowers and dress like this.\n\n\nIf we're gonna survive as a species,\nthis is our moment! What do you say?\n\n\nAre we going to be bees, orjust\nMuseum of Natural History keychains?\n\n\nWe're bees!\n\n\nKeychain!\n\n\nThen follow me! Except Keychain.\n\n\nHold on, Barry. Here.\n\n\nYou've earned this.\n\n\nYeah!\n\n\nI'm a Pollen Jock! And it's a perfect\nfit. All I gotta do are the sleeves.\n\n\nOh, yeah.\n\n\nThat's our Barry.\n\n\nMom! The bees are back!\n\n\nIf anybody needs\nto make a call, now's the time.\n\n\nI got a feeling we'll be\nworking late tonight!\n\n\nHere's your change. Have a great\nafternoon! Can I help who's next?\n\n\nWould you like some honey with that?\nIt is bee-approved. Don't forget these.\n\n\nMilk, cream, cheese, it's all me.\nAnd I don't see a nickel!\n\n\nSometimes I just feel\nlike a piece of meat!\n\n\nI had no idea.\n\n\nBarry, I'm sorry.\nHave you got a moment?\n\n\nWould you excuse me?\nMy mosquito associate will help you.\n\n\nSorry I'm late.\n\n\nHe's a lawyer too?\n\n\nI was already a blood-sucking parasite.\nAll I needed was a briefcase.\n\n\nHave a great afternoon!\n\n\nBarry, I just got this huge tulip order,\nand I can't get them anywhere.\n\n\nNo problem, Vannie.\nJust leave it to me.\n\n\nYou're a lifesaver, Barry.\nCan I help who's next?\n\n\nAll right, scramble, jocks!\nIt's time to fly.\n\n\nThank you, Barry!\n\n\nThat bee is living my life!\n\n\nLet it go, Kenny.\n\n\n- When will this nightmare end?!\n- Let it all go.\n\n\n- Beautiful day to fly.\n- Sure is.\n\n\nBetween you and me,\nI was dying to get out of that office.\n\n\nYou have got\nto start thinking bee, my friend.\n\n\n- Thinking bee!\n- Me?\n\n\nHold it. Let's just stop\nfor a second. Hold it.\n\n\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.\nCan we stop here?\n\n\nI'm not making a major life decision\nduring a production number!\n\n\nAll right.

James\nBut it's a shame the way poverty is on a run, pollution\nAll the destructions that's happening\nAnd the war of the world\nThat's right\nWhen the world began, it wasn't supposed to be this

"lyrics": "Sea of Thoughts LyricsThank you for the hospitality, nice couch, warm sheets\nI'm gonna get some sleep, but I'll peep the place in the morn'\nBe forewarned, I'm tipsy\nThere was a young miss that tipped me overboard\nAnd now I'm drowning in cheap vodka, I'm torn\nWhether to smoke some more, I pour a tall glass of H2O\nI know that if I don't I'll be way worse in my misery\nHard to be a busy bee when all this knowledge comes to me\nAnd all I seem to do is write some poetry\n\nA few thoughts that fluidly flow\nA few thoughts to sew together into one short verse\nAnd as I weather this weather and disperse, it gets worse\nAnd I summon the porcelain goddess to swallow up this hotness\nAnd my stomach is so nauseous\nTold my friends, \"Watch this!\"\nAnd as I guzzle, and guzzle and flex muscle\nMy liver is yelling, \"Stop this!\"\nTylenol bottle is yelling, \"Pop this!\"\n'Til the glass tells my hand to drop it\n\nSo I break that shit down like hip hoppin'\nFloating words, I've been through the air like Mary Poppins\nWhen they fall back down as electrical rain drops and they shock\nThat's why you see me on the dance floor, I'm popping lockin'\n\nDrop in the list of lyrical written material\nHas made you spin some more criteria\nThat goes better together than milk and cereal\nJust a theory though, a hair-brained crow-call, a verbal burial\nBut out some adjectives sprout and grow\nStir the pot and in some nouns we throw\nAnd what do you know?\nWe now have the whole vocabulary at our disposal\nDissolve some green in seeds to see if sticky leaves appear to be\nAnd secrete some sweetly THC for me to breathe\n\nHow could this be? Somebody must have stole the doobie\nSomebody thinks they won't be caught and took me for a newby\nThey took the richest's man, somebody stole the ruby\nLook, fool me once: you fooled me\nBut fool me twice: it won't be nice\nYou might also likeI do not advise you you convince me to despise you\nI'm not a violent person, but I can be quite spiteful\nAnd when I gather up my thoughts\nUntil my mind's full without being mindful\nI tend to see things through the eyes of a blind fool\nAnd that's not good for anyone\nI may not be great with fists\nBut I can melt your mind and make you fear something dumb\n\nConvince you you no longer have opposable thumbs\nConvince you you were adopted, that woman is not your mom\nConvince you that every right thought you ever had was wrong\nConvince you that you're not yourself, but you are truly no one\nBut fuck that, let's all go out and get some drinks\nSmoke some weed and talk philosophy about how the stoner thinks\n\nPut your mind on the brink\nLet it grow, let it flow down a black hole\nLike water down a sink\nOpen the floodgates; no time, no watches\nJust meditation, discovering strange new consciousness\n\nWhat is this? My thought process' overtaken\nToo complacent 'cause every single thought's adjacent\nI lasso the good ideas, so I no longer have to chase them\nI make you feel so good, it's like lyrical masturbation\nI spark a worry in your head that you haven't faced yet\nAnd now it's all you think about and you find yourself pacing\nYou think the time you spend trippin' is time well spent\nWhen really any time spent with worry is time well wasted\n'Cause you could have partied with your friends instead\nMaybe wind up in bed with some chick who gives great head\nThat's why I'm here to say lighten up quick\n'Cause life is way to short to live it like a prick\nYou gotta balance good karma and learn how to stick\nTo the moral fibers your parents invested as a kid\nLearn how to sift through the masses of bullshit\nAnd turn a deaf ear to the foolish word spit\n\nSome people don't quit\nSome people come equipped with a good mouthpiece\nAnd a demeanor that denies mean and embodies peace\nBut their peace of mind is nothing more than ignorance through speech\nThat's why you end up biting into such a bitter peach\nIt's such a beautiful concept that beauty is bitter sweet\nAnd you may not see the ball drop until it hits your feet\n\nThat's why I try to speak from the notches I put in my belt\n'Cause one can only speak from the cards they've been dealt\nAnd make for yourself, so say it\nSay that you'll go out and make mistakes\nPartake in the feast that awaits\nAnd never forsake the rain that weighs so heavy\nOn the levy in your mind's sea of thoughts\n'Cause one day that levy's gonna bust, and when it does\n\nYou let the world float upon your sea of thoughts\nYou let the world float upon your sea of thoughts\nYou let the world float upon your sea of thoughts\nYou let the world float upon your sea of thoughts, yeah\nYou let the world float upon your sea of thoughts\nYou let the world float upon your sea of thoughts\nYou let the world uh, you let the world uh\n\nAnd you may have your beautiful mind, oh, but I've got mine\nYou might throw malice in your words, oh, but I've heard worse\nSo don't think I'm pinning for your love 'cause I've got enough\nAnd I don't think any of us know how to live without ego\nNo, no ego. No, no ego\nKnow no ego, know no ego\nKnow no egoEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1061579", "artist_names": "Rich Mullins", "full_title": "The River

can drive as hard as he can drive\nAnd never get as far as his heart was meant to go\nSometimes when you look up in the sky\nYou think we might be closer than you know\n\nAnother tune forms in my head\nMore harmonies more empty words\nOh I could play these songs 'til I was dead\nAnd never approach the sound that I once heard\nI remember when I was just a kid\nListening in the sky\nBelieving that the wind would stir\nAnd I know the river is deep\nI found out that the currents are tricky\nAnd I know the river is wide\nAnd oh the currents are strong\nAnd I may lose every dream\nI dreamt that I could carry with me\nBut I have failed so many times\nAnd You've never let me fall down alone\n\nMaybe she could come to Wichita\nAnd maybe we could borrow Beaker's bike\nWe'd let the road wind tie our hair in knots\nLet the speed and the freedom untangle the lies\nMaybe fear can vanish before love\nOh God don't let this love be denied\n\n'Cause I know the river is deep\nI found out that the currents are tricky\nAnd I know that the river is wide\nAnd oh the currents are strong\nAnd I could lose every dream\nI dreamt that I could carry with me\nOh but I will reach the other side\nPlease don't let me have to wait too long\n\nAnother hour deeper in the night\nAnother mile farther down the road\nWe could be closer than you know\"You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

there so deep inside\n\nNothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning\nChasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away\nAnd when she turns to touch me I kiss her face so softly\nAnd my Mary wakes to love another day\nAnd Mary's there in sunny days or stormy weather\nShe doesn't care cause right or wrong, the love we share\nWe share together\n\nNothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the

The sun is gone\nAnd I think it's gonna rain\n\nSunday will never be the same\n(Sunday will never be the same)\nI've lost my Sunday song\nHe'll not be back again\n\nI remember children\nFeeding flocks of pigeons\nI remember sunshine\nAnd you were mine\n\nSunday will never be the same\n(Sunday will never be the same)\nI've lost my Sunday song\nHe'll not be back again\n\nSunday will never be the same\nSunday will never be the same\nSunday will never be the sameYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2173654", "artist_names": "Lee Scott (Ft.

to me\nWell, I'd deny the whole lot of you\nHorrible\nHope the whole roof falls on top of you\nI keep it real like money, g and only fade a few\nLike jim jones syndrome\nCult gang posse crew\nBrainwave, I pave that\nBuggin' in The basement\nFingers on the button\nAnd ---- blood on the apron[?]\nStinkin' up that mary jane\n[?] the danker grade\nIron lung trainin'\nSmokin' til I'm old and grey\nNow I gotsta talk a phrase[?]\nNow here's a doper phrase\nA fuckin' toke a day will help you keep your doc away\nI like my waters muddy\nAnd my pockets phat\nYou dropped your [?] I want her back[?]\nYou don't deserve to poke it\nSo hand it over, brag\nI bring the storm\nGet you open with the sanga knife\nYellow tape, half lines[?]\nBox cutter, deep hits\nChalk on the pavement\nThe body's on my Craigs[?]\nLove the sound of sirens\nGot it on the replay\nHigh in the mornin', cold saggin in the eveniiiin'!\n[Verse 2: Lee Scott]\nSweg, blood and coffee on me sheep skin coat\nReaching deep into me pocket for a smoke\nProbably the goat but I'd never gloat\nI walk up to the edge and float\nTo the other side, in a single humble stride\nRun and hide, before I trip and crush your pride\nThen leave for lunch and cut the pie five ways\nSo it's easier for me to munch (mmmm)\nOutside the chippy, tipsy, sipping a whisky\nClicking me fingers at a kid for a ciggy\nSitting pretty in the ugly tree\nDon't even look at me me when you look at me, just agree\nEyes on the floor while I dribble on\nIn your face with more faces than a quintesson\nAsking you rhetorical questions like \"Wheres your liquor gone?\"\nAnd what bottle I'm drinking from\nStarving me Digimon, I'm something like a Sicilian don\nAt the gates of heaven giving God shit on the intercom\nChances stuck between slim and none\nI meditate like \"Get money, fuck bitches, om\"\n\n[Verse 3: Hibernation]\nI used to wanna be a star, I'd love the money love the fame\nYeah, that'd be out this world but now all I want is space\nGet the fuck up out my face\nI don't got no true hope\nSpray painting overrated on Tupacs tombstone\nI carry the pistol mate, it's the american way\nIt'll make your character change like it did with Harriet Winslow\nSpeaking of Family Matters, no it don't so sit calm\nRemove your clothes, do it slow and take this fucking dick Mom\nSeal my blunts with holy water\nKill a priest and feel a rush\nI'm bumping Killah Priest\nTake whatever a pills I want\nFuck these kiddie rappers thinking that they something sick\nI'm only over your head, cus I'm tired of you sucking dick\nFucking pricks,

o'clock\nIn the mornin' when it's still too early to knock\nAnd the dusty light shines down on the block\nAnd reflects up and down on the hands of the clock\nSix o'clock, six o'clock\n\n[Verse 1]\nA few hours ago, she was standin' here\nJust watchin' the stars in our eyes\nAnd the lights as uptights disappear\nAnd I could feel I could say what I want\nThat I could nudge her and call her my confidante\nAnd now I'm back alone with just my shadow in front\nAt six o'clock, six o'clock\n[Verse 2]\nI went home and found that tryin' to sleep was a laugh\nJust watchin' my eyelids, knowin' my brain\nBids the night not to pass\nI got up and got scufflin' around\nBut somehow, it just wasn't the same happy town\nAnd the bells didn't ring with the same happy sound\nAt six o'clock, six o'clock\n\n[Bridge]\nIf I go back where we parted\nCould I ever be like that again?\nGuess I'll just have to wait 'til tomorrow\nBut what can I do 'til then?\n\n[Verse 3]\nGuess I'll go back home and just wait until dawn\nGuess I had to learn goin' back\nWhere we were wouldn't help at all\nAnd I wish my head had been workin' right\nWe'd have gone for coffee and talked all night\nAnd now I'm back alone feelin' twisted up tight\nSix o'clock, six o'clock\n\n[Outro]\nNow I'm back alone\nYes, now I'm back alone\nI'm back aloneYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

them\nLittle niggas, it's hard to find peace in them\nChiraq, they say it's Middle Easterin'\nPut your flames in the air for the deceased to them\nYoung soldiers who never got to become older\nDogtagged in the body bag\nPolice kept the knot he had\nPlus he had weed in his system\nNever knew at 13 they could enlist them\nMomma kissed him, body was colder\nShe was shaking, I tried to hold her\nTears on my shoulder, he was supposed to\nBe going to his junior year, this is his funeral year\nPall-bearers, all looking like kids\nSome faces show anger, some show tears\nNo mustaches, no beards\nProbably had the same aspirations as his\nOn a mission, staring in the distance\nIt never stop like the Muslims and Christians\nWe under-21 gun salute them\nJust to go back and recruit them\nI'm talkin' 'bout war\n[Hook x2]\nTo all the killas and the hundred dolla billas\nReal hittas who ain't got no feelins\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere's a war going on inside, no man is safe from, goin on\nGoing on, there's a war going on inside, no man is safe from\nOr can escape from, take one wars from the same place that hate from\nGang wars used to be about the nations\nNow it's cliques with clips and hittas is missing\nThey hit the innocent now they families miss him\nDeath do kissed him, in his last breath he wishing\nBut no option so he assume position\nIt don't stop, hittas killing women and children\nAngels cried, that's supposed to be God's decision\nCollisions of cliques named after rap groups\nExcept wearing Jordans instead of black boots\nBlack troops trade war stories reminiscent of Glory\nWalk the walk of those before me since I was a shorty\nSeen slugs and drugs and unemployment\nTerror town y'all was my first deployment\nThe life of a soldier ain't nothing to toy with\nI'm living in this shit while the world exploit it\nWar\n\n[Hook x2]\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nMy basic training was aiming, hustling, banging, changing niggas up\nCause of what they did to us, nigga, I don't give a fuck\nIt's do or die in the Chi and I ain't lived enough\nHoping for some visitors of war, I'm a prisoner\nPoliticians they did enough, want to get rid of us\nHopped in the back as soon as the shots hit the truck\nLooked at my son I could see his soul\nShot and killed at three years old\n[Interlude]\nWar, war, war, war!\nWe are at war!\n[Outro]\nThe direction was we, we came up with this concept, Nobody Smiling was really a thought that came about because of all the violence that was going on in Chicago, or that is going on. I like to say \"was\" cause we gon' bring it to fruition wishing that it's gonna stop. You know and uh, all the violence that was going on - it happens in Chicago but it's happening around the world in many ways. You know, it may not be to the numbers that's happening in Chicago but it's happening in the inner cities all over America so we's talking about the conditions of what's happening when I said \"Nobody

somehow, half sit down\nWithout help, make shift to even speak, you see,\nFortified by the sip of...why, 'tis wine,\nVelletri,--and not vinegar and gall,\nSo changed and good the times grow! Thanks, kind Sir!\nOh, but one sip's enough! I want my head\nTo save my neck, there's work awaits me still.\nHow cautious and considerate...aie, aie, aie,\nNot your fault, sweet Sir! Come, you take to heart\nAn ordinary matter. Law is law.\nNoblemen were exempt, the vulgar thought,\nFrom racking, but, since law thinks otherwise,\nI have been put to the rack: all's over now,\nAnd neither wrist--what men style, out of joint:\nIf any harm be, 'tis the shoulder-blade,\nThe left one, that seems wrong i' the socket,--Sirs,\nMuch could not happen, I was quick to faint,\nBeing past my prime of life, and out of health.\nIn short I thank you,--yes, and mean the word.\nNeeds must the Court be slow to understand\nHow this quite novel form of taking pain,\nThis getting tortured merely in the flesh,\nAmounts to almost an agreeable change\nIn my case, me fastidious, plied too much\nWith opposite treatment, used (forgive the joke)\nTo the rasp-tooth toying with this brain of mine,\nAnd, in and out my heart, the play o' the probe.\nFour years have I been operated on\nI' the soul, do you see--its tense or tremulous part--\nMy self-respect, my care for a good name,\nPride in an old one, love of kindred--just\nA mother, brothers, sisters, and the like,\nThat looked up to my face when days were dim,\nAnd fancied they found light there--no one spot,\nFoppishly sensitive, but has paid its pang.\nThat, and not this you now oblige me with,\nThat was the Vigil-torment, if you please!\nThe poor old noble House that drew the rags\nO' the Franceschini's once superb array\nClose round her, hoped to slink unchallenged by,--\nPluck off these! Turn the drapery inside out\nAnd teach the tittering town how scarlet wears!\nShow men the lucklessness, the improvidence\nOf the easy-natured Count before this Count,\nThe father I have some slight feeling for,\nWho let the world slide, nor foresaw that friends\nThen proud to cap and kiss the patron's shoe,\nWould, when the purse he left held spider-webs,\nProperly push his child to wall one day!\nMimic the tetchy humour, furtive glance\nAnd brow where half was furious half fatigued,\nO' the same son got to be of middle age,\nSour, saturnine,--your humble servant here;--\nWhen things go cross and the young wife, he finds\nTake to the window at a whistle's bid,\nAnd yet demurs thereon, preposterous fool!--\nWhereat the worthies judge he wants advice\nAnd beg to civilly ask what's evil here,\nPerhaps remonstrate on the habit they deem\nHe's given unduly to, of beating her\n? Oh, sure he beats her--why says John so else,\nWho is cousin to George who is sib to Tecla's self\nWho cooks the meal and combs the lady's hair?\nWhat? 'Tis my wrist you merely dislocate\nFor the future when you mean me martyrdom?\n--Let the old mother's economy alone,\nHow the brocade-strips saved o' the seamy side\nO' the wedding-gown buy raiment for a year?\n--How she can dress and dish up--lordly dish\nFit for a duke, lamb's head and purtenance--\nWith her proud hands, feast household so a week?\nNo word o' the wine rejoicing God and man\nThe less when three-parts water? Then, I say,\nA trifle of torture to the flesh, like yours,\nWhile soul is spared such foretaste of hell-fire,\nIs naught. But I curtail the catalogue\nThrough policy,--a rhetorician's trick,--\nBecause I would reserve some choicer points\nO' the practice, more exactly parallel--\n(Having an eye to climax) with what gift,\nEventual grace the Court may have in store\nI' the way of plague--my crown of punishments.\nWhen I am hanged or headed, time enough\nTo prove the tenderness of only that,\nMere heading, hanging,--not their counterpart,\nNot demonstration public and precise\nThat I, having married the mongrel of a drab,\nAm bound to grant that mongrel-brat, my wife,\nHer mother's birthright-licence as is just,--\nLet her sleep undisturbed, i' the family style,\nHer sleep out in the embraces of a priest,\nNor disallow their bastard as my heir!\nYour sole mistake,--dare I submit so much\nTo the reverend Court?--has been in all this pains\nTo make a stone roll down hill,--rack and wrench\nAnd rend a man to pieces, all for what?\nWhy--make him ope mouth in his own defence,\nShow cause for what he has done, the irregular deed,\n(Since that he did it, scarce dispute can be)\nAnd clear his fame a little, beside the luck\nOf stopping even yet, if possible,\nDiscomfort to his flesh from noose or axe--\nFor that, out come the implements of law!\nMay it content my lords the gracious Court\nTo listen only half so patient-long\nAs I will in that sense profusely speak,\nAnd--fie, they shall not call in screws to help!\nI killed Pompilia Franceschini, Sirs;\nKilled too the Comparini, husband, wife,\nWho called themselves, by a notorious lie,\nHer father and her mother to ruin me.\nThere's the irregular deed: you want no more\nThan right interpretation of the same,\nAnd truth so far--am I to understand?\nTo that then, with convenient speed,--because\nNow I consider,--yes, despite my boast,\nThere is an ailing in this omoplat\nMay clip my speech all too abruptly close,\nWhatever the good-will in me. Now for truth!\nI' the name of the indivisible Trinity!\nWill my lords, in the plentitude of their light,\nWeigh well that all this trouble has come on me\nThrough my persistent treading in the paths\nWhere I was trained to go,--wearing that yoke\nMy shoulder was predestined to receive,\nBorn to the hereditary stoop and crease?\nNoble, I recognised my nobler still,\nThe church, my suzerain; no mock-mistress, she;\nThe secular owned the spiritual: mates of mine\nHave thrown their careless hoofs up at her call\n\"Forsake the clover and come drag my wain!\"\nThere they go cropping: I protruded nose\nTo halter, bent my back of docile beast,\nAnd now am whealed, one wide wound all of me,\nFor being found at the eleventh hour o' the day\nPadding the mill-track, not neck-deep in grass:\n--My one fault, I am stiffened by my work,\n--My one reward, I help the Court to smile!\nI am representative of a great line,\nOne of the first of the old families\nIn Arezzo, ancientest of Tuscan towns.\nWhen my worst foe is fain to challenge this,\nHis worst exception runs--not first in rank\nBut second, noble in the next degree\nOnly; not malice 'self maligns me more.\nSo, my lord opposite has composed, we know,\nA marvel of a book, sustains the point\nThat Francis boasts the primacy 'mid saints;\nYet not inaptly hath his argument\nObtained response from yon my other lord\nIn thesis published with the world's applause\n--Rather 'tis Dominic such post befits:\nWhy, at the worst, Francis stays Francis still,\nSecond in rank to Dominic it may be,\nStill, very saintly, very like our Lord;\nAnd I at least descend from a Guido once\nHomager to the Empire, nought below--\nOf which account as proof that, none o' the line\nHaving a single gift beyond brave blood,\nOr able to do aught but give, give, give\nIn blood and brain, in house and land and cash,\nNot get and garner as the vulgar may,\nWe become poor as Francis or our Lord.\nBe that as it likes you, Sirs,--whenever it chanced\nMyself grew capable anyway of remark,\n(Which was soon--penury makes wit premature)\nThis struck me, I was poor who should be rich\nOr pay that fault to the world which trifles not\nWhen lineage lacks the flag yet lifts the pole:\nTherefore I must make more forthwith, transfer\nMy stranded self, born fish with gill and fin\nFit for the deep sea, now left bare-backed\nIn slush and sand, a show to crawlers vile\nReared of the low-tide and aright therein.\nThe enviable youth with the old name,\nWide chest, stout arms, sound brow and pricking veins,\nA heartful of desire, man's natural load,\nA brainful of belief, the noble's lot,--\nAll this life, cramped and gasping, high and dry\nI' the wave's retreat,--the misery, good my lords,\nWhich made you merriment at Rome of late,--\nIt made me reason, rather--muse, demand\n--Why our bare dropping palace, in the street\nWhere such-an-one whose grandfather sold tripe\nWas adding to his purchased pile a fourth\nTall tower, could hardly show a turret sound?\nWhy Beatrice Countess, whose son I am,\nCowered in the winter-time as she spun flax,\nBlew on the earthen basket of live ash.\nInstead of jaunting forth in coach and six\nLike such-another widow who ne'er was wed?\nI asked my fellows, how came this about?\n\"Why, Jack, the suttler's child, perhaps the camp's,\n\"Went to the wars, fought sturdily, took a town\n\"And got rewarded as was natural.\n\"She of the coach and six--excuse me there!\n\"Why, don't you know the story of her friend?\n\"A clown dressed vines on somebody's estate,\n\"His boy recoiled from muck, liked Latin more,\n\"Stuck to his pen, and got to be a priest,\n\"Till one day...don't you mind that telling tract\n\"Against Molinos, the old Cardinal wrote?\n\"He penned and dropped it in the patron's desk\n\"Who, deep in thought and absent much of mind,\n\"Licensed the thing, allowed it for his own;\n\"Quick came promotion,--suum cuique, Count!\n\"Oh, he can pay for coach and six, be sure!\"\n\"--Well, let me go, do likewise: war's the word--\n\"That way the Franceschini worked at first,\n\"I'll take my turn, try soldiership.\"--\"What, you?\n\"The eldest son and heir and prop o' the house,\n\"So do you see your duty? Here's your post,\n\"Hard by the hearth and altar.

Try the Church,\n\"The tonsure, and,--since heresy's but half-slain\n\"Even by the Cardinal's tract he thought he wrote,--\n\"Have at Molinos!\"--\"Have at a fool's head!\n\"You a priest? How were marriage possible?\n\"There must be Franceschini till time ends--\n\"That's your vocation. Make your brothers priests,\n\"Paul shall be porporate, and Girolamo step\n\"Red-stockinged in the presence when you choose,\n\"But save one Franceschini for the age!\n\"Be not the vine but dig and dung its root,\n\"Be not a priest but gird up priesthood's loins,\n\"With one foot in Arezzo stride to Rome,\n\"Spend yourself there and bring the purchase back!\n\"Go hence to Rome, be guided!\"\nSo I was.\nI turned alike from the hill-side zig-zag thread\nOf way to the table-land a soldier takes,\nAlike from the low-lying pasture-place\nWhere churchmen graze, recline, and ruminate,\n--Ventured to mount no platform like my lords\nWho judge the world, bear brain I dare not brag--\nBut stationed me, might thus the expression serve,\nAs who should fetch and carry, come and go,\nMeddle and make i' the cause my lords love most--\nThe public weal, which hangs to the law, which holds\nBy the Church, which happens to be through God himself.\nHumbly I helped the Church till here I stand,--\nOr would stand but for the omoplat, you see!\nBidden qualify for Rome, I, having a field,\nWent, sold it, laid the sum at Peter's foot:\nWhich means--I settled home-accounts with speed,\nSet apart just a modicum should suffice\nTo keep the villa's head above the waves\nOf weed inundating its oil and wine,\nAnd prop roof, stanchion wall o' the palace so\nIt should keep breath i' the body, hold its own\nAmid the advance of neighbouring loftiness--\n(People like building where they used to beg)--\nTill succoured one day,--shared the residue\nBetween my mother and brothers and sisters there,\nBlack-eyed babe Donna This and Donna That,\nAs near to starving as might decently be,\n--Left myself journey-charges, change of suit,\nA purse to put i' the pocket of the Groom\nO' the Chamber of the patron, and a glove\nWith a ring to it for the digits of the niece\nSure to be helpful in his household,--then\nStarted for Rome, and led the life prescribed.\nClose to the Church, though clean of it, I assumed\nThree or four orders of no consequence,\nThey cast out evil spirits and exorcise,\nFor example; bind a man to nothing more,\nGive clerical savour to his layman's-salt,\nFacilitate his claim to loaf and fish\nShould miracle leave, beyond what feeds the flock,\nFragments to brim the basket of a friend--\nWhile, for the world's sake, I rode, danced, and gamed,\nQuitted me like a courtier, measured mine\nWith whatsoever blade had fame in fence,\n--Ready to let the basket go its round\nEven though my turn was come to help myself,\nShould Dives count on me at dinner-time\nAs just the understander of a joke\nAnd not immoderate in repartee.\nUtrique sic paratus, Sirs, I said\n\"Here,\" (in the fortitude of years fifteen,\nSo good a pedagogue is penury)\n\"Here wait, do service,--serving and to serve!\n\"And, in due time, I nowise doubt at all,\n\"The recognition of my service comes.\n\"Next year I'm only sixteen. I can wait.\"\nI waited thirty years, may it please the Court:\nSaw meanwhile many a denizen o' the dung\nHop, skip, jump o'er my shoulder, make him wings\nAnd fly aloft,--succeed, in the usual phrase.\nEvery one soon or late comes round by Rome:\nStand still here, you'll see all in turn succeed.\nWhy, look you, so and so, the physician here,\nMy father's lacquey's son we sent to school,\nDoctored and dosed this Eminence and that,\nSalved the last Pope his certain obstinate sore,\nSoon bought land as became him, names it now:\nI grasp bell at his griffin-guarded gate,\nTraverse the half-mile avenue,--a term,\nA cypress, and a statue, three and three,--\nDeliver message from my Monsignor,\nWith varletry at lounge i' the vestibule\nI'm barred from, who bear mud upon my shoe.\nMy father's chaplain's nephew, Chamberlain,--\nNothing less, please you!--courteous all the same,\n--He does not see me though I wait an hour\nAt his staircase-landing 'twixt the brace of busts,\nA noseless Sylla, Marius maimed to match,\nMy father gave him for a hexastich\nMade on my birth-day,--but he sends me down,\nTo make amends, that relic I prize most--\nThe unburnt end o' the very candle, Sirs,\nPurfled with paint so prettily round and round,\nHe carried in such state last Peter's day,--\nIn token I, his gentleman and squire,\nHad held the bridle, walked his managed mule\nWithout a tittup the procession through.\nNay, the official,--one you know, sweet lords!--\nWho drew the warrant for my transfer late\nTo the New Prisons from Tordinona,--he\nGraciously had remembrance--\"Francesc...ha?\n\"His sire, now--how a thing shall come about!--\n\"Paid me a dozen florins above the fee,\n\"For drawing deftly up a deed of sale\n\"When troubles fell so thick on him, good heart,\n\"And I was prompt and pushing!

Brief, one day I felt\nThe tick of time inside me, turning-point\nAnd slight sense there was now enough of this:\nThat I was near my seventh climacteric,\nHard upon, if not over, the middle life,\nAnd, although fed by the east-wind, fulsome-fine\nWith foretaste of the Land of Promise, still\nMy gorge gave symptom it might play me false;\nBetter not press it further,--be content\nWith living and dying only a nobleman,\nWho merely had a father great and rich,\nWho simply had one greater and richer yet,\nAnd so on back and back till first and best\nBegan i' the night; I finish in the day.\n\"The mother must be getting old,\" I said,\n\"The sisters are well wedded away, our name\n\"Can manage to pass a sister off, at need,\n\"And do for dowry: both my brothers thrive--\n\"Regular priests they are, nor, hat-like, 'bide\n\"'Twixt flesh and fowl with neither privilege.\n\"My spare revenue must keep me and mine.\n\"I am tired: Arezzo's air is good to breathe;\n\"Vittiano,--one limes flocks of thrushes there;\n\"A leathern coat costs little and lasts long:\n\"Let me bid hope good-bye, content at home!\"\nThus, one day, I disbosomed me and bowed.\nWhereat began the little buzz and thrill\nO' the gazers round me; each face brightened up:\nAs when at your Casino, deep in dawn,\nA gamester says at last, \"I play no more,\n\"Forego gain, acquiesce in loss, withdraw\n\"Anyhow:\" and the watchers of his ways,\nA trifle struck compunctious at the word,\nYet sensible of relief, breathe free once more,\nBreak up the ring, venture polite advice--\n\"How, Sir?

When I find\nThat pure smooth egg which, laid within my nest,\nCould not but hatch a comfort to us all,\nIssues a cockatrice for me and mine,\nDo you stare to see me stamp on it? Swans are soft:\nIs it not clear that she you call my wife,\nThat any wife of any husband, caught\nWhetting a sting like this against his breast,--\nSpeckled with fragments of the fresh-broke shell,\nMarried a month and making outcry thus,--\nProves a plague-prodigy to God and man?\nShe married: what was it she married for,\nCounted upon and meant to meet thereby?\n\"Love\" suggests some one, \"love, a little word\n\"Whereof we have not heard one syllable.\"\nSo, the Pompilia, child, girl, wife, in one,\nWanted the beating pulse, the rolling eye,\nThe frantic gesture, the devotion due\nFrom Thyrsis to NeAera! Guido's love--\nWhy not proven\u00e7al roses in his shoe,\nPlume to his cap, and trio of guitars\nAt casement, with a bravo close beside?\nGood things all these are, clearly claimable\nWhen the fit price is paid the proper way.\nHad it been some friend's wife, now, threw her fan\nAt my foot, with just this pretty scrap attached,\n\"Shame, death, damnation--fall these as they may,\n\"So I find you, for a minute!

But here,\nWe talk of just a marriage, if you please--\nThe every-day conditions and no more;\nWhere do these bind me to bestow one drop\nOf blood shall dye my wife's true-love-knot pink?\nPompilia was no pigeon, Venus' pet,\nThat shuffled from between her pressing paps\nTo sit on my rough shoulder,--but a hawk,\nI bought at a hawk's price and carried home\nTo do hawk's service--at the Rotunda, say,\nWhere, six o' the callow nestlings in a row,\nYou pick and choose and pay the price for such.\nI have paid my pound, await my penny's worth,\nSo, hoodwink, starve, and properly train my bird,\nAnd, should she prove a haggard,--twist her neck!\nDid I not pay my name and style, my hope\nAnd trust, my all? Through spending these amiss\nI am here!

How of the Monk\nWho finds the claustral regimen too sharp\nAfter the first month's essay? What's the mode\nWith the Deacon who supports indifferently\nThe rod o' the Bishop when he tastes its smart\nFull four weeks? Do you straightway slacken hold\nOf the innocents, the all-unwary ones\nWho, eager to profess, mistook their mind?--\nRemit a fast-day's rigour to the Monk\nWho fancied Francis' manna meant roast quails,\nConcede the Deacon sweet society,\nHe never thought the levite-rule renounced,--\nOr rather prescribe short chain and sharp scourge\nCorrective of such peccant humours? This--\nI take to be the Church's mode, and mine,\nIf I was over-harsh,--the worse i' the wife\nWho did not win from harshness as she ought,\nWanted the patience and persuasion, lore\nOf love, should cure me and console herself.\nPut case that I mishandle, flurry, and fright\nMy hawk through clumsiness in sportsmanship,\nTwitch out five pens where plucking one would serve--\nWhat, shall she bite and claw to mend the case?\nAnd, if you find I pluck five more for that,\nShall you weep \"Now he roughs the turtle there?\"\n\nSuch was the starting; now of the further step.\nIn lieu of taking penance in good part,\nThe Monk, with hue and cry, summons a mob\nTo make a bonfire of the convent, say,--\nAnd the Deacon's pretty piece of virtue (save\nThe ears o' the Court! I try to save my head)\nInstructed by the ingenuous postulant,\nTaxes the Bishop with adultery (mud\nNeeds must pair off with mud, and filth with filth)--\nSuch being my next experience: who knows not--\nThe couple, father and mother of my wife,\nReturned to Rome, published before my lords,\nPut into print, made circulate far and wide\nThat they had cheated me who cheated them?\nPompilia, I supposed their daughter, drew\nBreath first 'mid Rome's worst rankness, through the deed\nOf a drab and a rogue, was bye-blow bastard-babe\nOf a nameless strumpet, passed off, palmed on me\nAs the daughter with the dowry.

I started and let drop\nThe dagger. \"Where is it, His promised peace?\"\nNine days o' the Birth-Feast did I pause and pray\nTo enter into no temptation more.\nI bore the hateful house, my brother's once,\nDeserted,--let the ghost of social joy\nMock and make mouths at me from empty room\nAnd idle door that missed the master's step,--\nBore the frank wonder of incredulous eyes,\nAs my own people watched without a word,\nWaited, from where they huddled round the hearth\nBlack like all else, that nod so slow to come--\nI stopped my ears even to the inner call\nOf the dread duty, heard only the song\n\"Peace upon earth,\" saw nothing but the face\nO' the Holy Infant and the halo there\nAble to cover yet another face\nBehind it, Satan's which I else should see.\nBut, day by day, joy waned and withered off:\nThe Babe's face, premature with peak and pine,\nSank into wrinkled ruinous old age,\nSuffering and death, then mist-like disappeared,\nAnd showed only the Cross at end of all,\nLeft nothing more to interpose 'twixt me\nAnd the dread duty,--for the angel's song,\n\"Peace upon earth,\" louder and louder pealed\n\"O Lord, how long, how long be unavenged?\"\nOn the ninth day, this grew too much for man.\nI started up--\"Some end must be!\" At once,\nSilence: then, scratching like a death-watch-tick,\nSlowly within my brain was syllabled,\n\"One more concession, one decisive way\n\"And but one, to determine thee the truth,--\n\"This way, in fine, I whisper in thy ear:\n\"Now doubt, anon decide, thereupon act!\"\n\n\"That is a way, thou whisperest in my ear!\n\"I doubt, I will decide, then act,\" said I--\nThen beckoned my companions: \"Time is come!\"\n\nAnd so, all yet uncertain save the will\nTo do right, and the daring aught save leave\nRight undone, I did find myself at last\nI' the dark before the villa with my friends,\nAnd made the experiment, the final test,\nUltimate chance that ever was to be\nFor the wretchedness inside. I knocked--pronounced\nThe name, the predetermined touch for truth,\n\"What welcome for the wanderer? Open straight--\"\nTo the friend, physician, friar upon his rounds,\nTraveller belated, beggar lame and blind?--\nNo, but--\"to Caponsacchi!\" And the door\nOpened.\nAnd then,--why, even then, I think,\nI' the minute that confirmed my worst of fears,\nSurely,--I pray God that I think aright!--\nHad but Pompilia's self, the tender thing\nWho once was good and pure, was once my lamb\nAnd lay in my bosom, had the well-known shape\nFronted me in the door-way,--stood there faint\nWith the recent pang, perhaps, of giving birth\nTo what might, though by miracle, seem my child,--\nNay more, I will say, had even the aged fool\nPietro, the dotard, in whom folly and age\nWrought, more than enmity or malevolence,\nTo practise and conspire against my peace,--\nHad either of these but opened, I had paused.\nBut it was she the hag, she that brought hell\nFor a dowry with her to her husband's house,\nShe the mock-mother, she that made the match\nAnd married me to perdition, spring and source\nO' the fire inside me that boiled up from heart\nTo brain and hailed the Fury gave it birth,--\nViolante Comparini, she it was,\nWith the old grin amid the wrinkles yet,\nOpened: as if in turning from the Cross,\nWith trust to keep the sight and save my soul,\nI had stumbled, first thing, on the serpent's head\nCoiled with a leer at foot of it.\n\nThere was the end!\nThen was I rapt away by the impluse, one\nImmeasurable everlasting wave of a need\nTo abolish that detested life. 'Twas done:\nYou know the rest and how the folds o' the thing,\nTwisting for help, involved the other two\nMore or less serpent-like: how I was mad,\nBlind, stamped on all, the earth-worms with the asp,\nAnd ended so.\nYou came on me that night,\nYour officers of justice,--caught the crime\nIn the first natural frenzy of remorse?\nTwenty miles off, sound sleeping as a child\nOn a cloak i' the straw which promised shelter first,\nWith the bloody arms beside me,--was it not so?\nWherefore not? Why, how else should I be found?\nI was my own self, had my sense again,\nMy soul safe from the serpents. I could sleep:\nIndeed and, dear my lords, I shall sleep now,\nSpite of my shoulder, in five minutes' space,\nWhen you dismiss me, having truth enough!\nIt is but a few days are passed, I find,\nSince this adventure. Do you tell me, four?\nThen the dead are scarce quiet where they lie,\nOld Pietro, old Violante, side by side\nAt the church Lorenzo,--oh, they know it well!\nSo do I. But my wife is still alive,\nHas breath enough to tell her story yet,\nHer way, which is not mine, no doubt at all.\nAnd Caponsacchi, you have summoned him,--\nWas he so far to send for? Not at hand?\nI thought some few o' the stabs were in his heart,\nOr had not been so lavish,--less had served.\nWell, he too tells his story,--florid prose\nAs smooth as mine is rough. You see, my lords,\nThere will be a lying intoxicating smoke\nBorn of the blood,--confusion probably,--\nFor lies breed lies--but all that rests with you!\nThe trial is no concern of mine; with me\nThe main of the care is over: I at least\nRecognise who took that huge burthen off,\nLet me begin to live again. I did\nGod's bidding and man's duty, so, breathe free;\nLook you to the rest! I heard Himself prescribe,\nThat great Physician, and dared lance the core\nOf the bad ulcer; and the rage abates,\nI am myself and whole now: I prove cured\nBy the eyes that see, the ears that hear again,\nThe limbs that have relearned their youthful play,\nThe healthy taste of food and feel of clothes\nAnd taking to our common life once more,\nAll that now urges my defence from death.\nThe willingness to live, what means it else?\nBefore,--but let the very action speak!\nJudge for yourselves, what life seemed worth to me\nWho, not by proxy but in person, pitched\nHead-foremost into danger as a fool\nThat never cares if he can swim or no--\nSo he but find the bottom, braves the brook.\nNo man omits precaution, quite neglects\nSecrecy, safety, schemes not how retreat,\nHaving schemed he might advance. Did I so scheme?\nWhy, with a warrant which 'tis ask and have,\nWith horse thereby made mine without a word,\nI had gained the frontier and slept safe that night.\nThen, my companions,--call them what you please,\nSlave or stipendiary,--what need of one\nTo me whose right-hand did its owner's work?\nHire an assassin yet expose yourself?\nAs well buy glove and then thrust naked hand\nI' the thorn-bush. No, the wise man stays at home,\nSends only agents out, with pay to earn:\nAt home, when they come back,--he straight discards\nOr else disowns. Why use such tools at all\nWhen a man's foes are of his house, like mine,\nSit at his board, sleep in his bed? Why noise,\nWhen there's the acquetta and the silent way?\nClearly my life was valueless.\n\nBut now\nHealth is returned, and sanity of soul\nNowise indifferent to the body's harm.\nI find the instinct bids me save my life;\nMy wits, too, rally round me; I pick up\nAnd use the arms that strewed the ground before,\nUnnoticed or spurned aside: I take my stand,\nMake no defence. God shall not lose a life\nMay do Him further service, while I speak\nAnd you hear, you my judges and last hope!\nYou are the law: 'tis to the law I look.\nI began life by hanging to the law,\nTo the law it is I hang till life shall end.\nMy brother made appeal to the Pope, 'tis true,\nTo stay proceedings, judge my cause himself\nNor trouble law,--some fondness of conceit\nThat rectitude, sagacity sufficed\nThe investigator in a case like mine,\nDispensed with the machine of law. The Pope\nKnew better, set aside my brother's plea\nAnd put me back to law,--referred the cause\nAd judices meos,--doubtlessly did well.\nHere, then, I clutch my judges,--I claim law--\nCry, by the higher law whereof your law\nO' the land is humbly representative,--\nCry, on what point is it, where either accuse,\nI fail to furnish you defence? I stand\nAcquitted, actually or virtually,\nBy every intermediate kind of court\nThat takes account of right or wrong in man,\nEach unit in the series that begins\nWith God's throne, ends with the tribunal here.\nGod breathes, not speaks, his verdicts, felt not heard,\nPassed on successively to each court I call\nMan's conscience, custom, manners, all that make\nMore and more effort to promulgate, mark\nGod's verdict in determinable words,\nTill last come human jurists--solidify\nFluid result,--what's fixable lies forged,\nStatute,--the residue escapes in fume,\nYet hangs aloft, a cloud, as palpable\nTo the finer sense as word the legist welds.\nJustinian's Pandects only make precise\nWhat simply sparkled in men's eyes before,\nTwitched in their brow or quivered on their lip,\nWaited the speech they called but would not come,\nThese courts then, whose decree your own confirms,--\nTake my whole life, not this last act alone,\nLook on it by the light reflected thence!\nWhat has Society to charge me with?\nCome, unreservedly,--favour nor fear,--\nI am Guido Franceschini, am I not?\nYou know the courses I was free to take?\nI took just that which let me serve the Church,\nI gave it all my labour in body and soul\nTill these broke down i' the service. \"Specify?\"\nWell, my last patron was a Cardinal.\nI left him unconvicted of a fault--\nWas even helped, by way of gratitude,\nInto the new life that I left him for,\nThis very misery of the marriage,--he\nMade it, kind soul, so far as in him lay--\nSigned the deed where you yet may see his name.\nHe is gone to his reward,--dead, being my friend\nWho could have helped here also,--that, of course!\nSo far, there's my acquittal, I suppose.\nThen comes the marriage itself--no question, lords,\nOf the entire validity of that!\nIn the extremity of distress, 'tis true,\nFor after-reasons, furnished abundantly,\nI wished the thing invalid, went to you\nOnly some months since, set you duly forth\nMy wrong and prayed your remedy, that a cheat\nShould not have force to cheat my whole life long.\n\"Annul a marriage? 'Tis impossible!\n\"Though ring about your neck be brass not gold,\n\"Needs must it clasp, gangrene you all the same!\"\nWell, let me have the benefit, just so far,\nO' the fact announced,--my wife then is my wife,\nI have allowance for a husband's right.\nI am charged with passing right's due bound,--such acts\nAs I thought just, my wife called cruelty,\nComplained of in due form,--convoked no court\nOf common gossipry, but took her wrongs--\nAnd not once, but so long as patience served--\nTo the town's top, jurisdiction's pride of place,\nTo the Archbishop and the Governor.\nThese heard her charge with my reply, and found\nThat futile, this sufficient: they dismissed\nThe hysteric querulous rebel, and confirmed\nAuthority in its wholesome exercise,\nThey, with directest access to the facts.\n\"--Ay, for it was their friendship favoured you,\n\"Hereditary alliance against a breach\n\"I' the social order: prejudice for the name\n\"Of Franceschini!\"--So I hear it said:\nBut not here. You, lords, never will you say\n\"Such is the nullity of grace and truth,\n\"Such the corruption of the faith, such lapse\n\"Of law, such warrant have the Molinists\n\"For daring reprehend us as they do,--\n\"That we pronounce it just a common case,\n\"Two dignitaries, each in his degree\n\"First, foremost, this the spiritual head, and that\n\"The secular arm o' the body politic,\n\"Should, for mere wrongs' love and injustice' sake,\n\"Side with, aid and abet in cruelty\n\"This broken beggarly noble,--bribed perhaps\n\"By his watered wine and mouldy crust of bread--\n\"Rather than that sweet tremulous flower-like wife\n\"Who kissed their hands and curled about their feet\n\"Looking the irresistible loveliness\n\"In tears that takes man captive, turns\"...enough!\nDo you blast your predecessors? What forbids\nPosterity to trebly blast yourselves\nWho set the example and instruct their tongue?\nYou dreaded the crowd, succumbed to the popular cry,\nOr else, would nowise seem defer thereto\nAnd yield to public clamour though i'the right!\nYou riddled your eye of my unseemliness,\nThe noble whose misfortune wearied you,--\nOr, what's more probable, made common cause\nWith the cleric section, punished in myself\nMaladroit uncomplaisant laity,\nDefective in behaviour to a priest\nWho claimed the customary partnership\nI' the house and the wife. Lords, any lie will serve!\nLook to it,--or allow me freed so far!\n\nThen I proceed a step, come with clean hands\nThus far, re-tell the tale told eight months since.\nThe wife, you allow so far, I have not wronged,\nHas fled my roof, plundered me and decamped\nIn company with the priest her paramour:\nAnd I gave chase, came up with, caught the two\nAt the wayside inn where both had spent the night,\nFound them in flagrant fault, and found as well,\nBy documents with name and plan and date,\nThe fault was furtive then that's flagrant now,\nTheir intercourse a long established crime.\nI did not take the license law's self gives\nTo slay both criminals o' the spot at the time,\nBut held my hand,--preferred play prodigy\nOf patience which the world calls cowardice,\nRather than seem anticipate the law\nAnd cast discredit on its organs,--you--\nSo, to your bar I brought both criminals,\nAnd made my statement: heard their counter-charge\nNay,--their corroboration of my tale,\nNowise disputing its allegements, not\nI' the main, not more than nature's decency\nCompels men to keep silence in this kind,--\nOnly contending that the deeds avowed\nWould take another colour and bear excuse.\nYou were to judge between us; so you did.\nYou disregard the excuse, you breathe away\nThe colour of innocence and leave guilt black,\n\"Guilty\" is the decision of the court,\nAnd that I stand in consequence untouched,\nOne white intergity from head to heel.\nNot guilty? Why then did you punish them?\nTrue, punishment has been inadequate--\n'Tis not I only, not my friends that joke,\nMy foes that jeer, who echo \"inadequate\"--\nFor, by a chance that comes to help for once,\nThe same case simultaneously was judged\nAt Arezzo, in the province of the Court\nWhere the crime had beginning but not end.\nThey then, deciding on but half o' the crime,\nThe effraction, robbery,--features of the fault\nI never cared to dwell upon at Rome,--\nWhat was it they adjudged as penalty\nTo Pompilia,--the one criminal o' the pair\nAmenable to their judgment, not the priest\nWho is Rome's? Why, just imprisonment for life\nI' the Stinche. There was Tuscany's award\nTo a wife that robs her husband: you at Rome\nHaving to deal with adultery in a wife\nAnd, in a priest, breach of the priestly vow,\nGive gentle sequestration for a month\nIn a manageable Convent, then release,\nYou call imprisonment, in the very house\nO' the very couple, the sole aim and end\nOf the culprits' crime was--there to reach and rest\nAnd there take solace and defy me: well,--\nThis difference 'twixt their penalty and yours\nIs immaterial: make your penalty less--\nMerely that she should henceforth wear black gloves\nAnd white fan, she who wore the opposite--\nWhy, all the same the fact o' the thing subsists.\nReconcile to your conscience as you may,\nBe it on your own heads, you pronounced one half\nO' the penalty for heinousness like hers\nAnd his, that's for a fault at Carnival\nOf comfit-pelting past discretion's law,\nOr accident to handkerchief in Lent\nWhich falls perversely as a lady kneels\nAbruptly, and but half conceals her neck!\nI acquiesce for my part,--punished, though\nBy a pin-point scratch, means guilty: guilty means\n--What have I been but innocent hitherto?\nAnyhow, here the offence, being punished, ends.\n\nEnds?--for you deemed so, did you not, sweet lords?\nThat was throughout the veritable aim\nO' the sentence light or heavy,--to redress\nRecognised wrong? You righted me, I think?\nWell then,--what if I, at this last of all,\nDemonstrate you, as my whole pleading proves,\nNo particle of wrong received thereby\nOne atom of right?--that cure grew worse disease?\nThat in the process you call \"justice done\"\nAll along you have nipped away just inch\nBy inch the creeping climbing length of plague\nBreaking my tree of life from root to branch,\nAnd left me, after all and every act\nOf your interference,--lightened of what load?\nAt liberty wherein? Mere words and wind!\n\"Now I was saved, now I should feel no more\n\"The hot breath, find a respite from fixed eye\n\"And vibrant tongue!\" Why, scarce your back was turned,\nThere was the reptile, that feigned death at first,\nRenewing its detested spire and spire\nAround me, rising to such heights of hate\nThat, so far from mere purpose now to crush\nAnd coil itself on the remains of me,\nBody and mind, and there flesh fang content.\nIts aim is now to evoke life from death,\nMake me anew, satisfy in my son\nThe hunger I may feed but never sate,\nTormented on to perpetuity,--\nMy son, whom, dead, I shall know, understand,\nFeel, hear, see, never more escape the sight\nIn heaven that's turned to hell, or hell returned\n(So, rather, say) to this same earth again,--\nMoulded into the image and made one,\nFashioned of soul as featured like in face,\nFirst taught to laugh and lisp and stand and go\nBy that thief, poisoner, and adulteress\nI call Pompilia, he calls...sacred name,\nBe unpronounced, be unpolluted here!\nAnd last led up to the glory and prize of hate\nBy his...foster-father, Caponsacchi's self,\nThe perjured priest, pink of conspirators,\nTricksters and knaves, yet polished, superfine,\nManhood to model adolescence by...\nLords, look on me, declare,--when, what I show,\nIs nothing more nor less than what you deemed\nAnd doled me out for justice,--what did you say?\nFor reparation, restitution and more,--\nWill you not thank, praise, bid me to your breasts\nFor having done the thing you thought to do,\nAnd thoroughly trampled out sin's life at last?\nI have heightened phrase to make your soft speech serve,\nDoubled the blow you but essayed to strike,\nCarried into effect your mandate here\nThat else had fallen to ground: mere duty done,\nOversight of the master just supplied\nBy zeal i' the servant: I, being used to serve,\nHave simply...what is it they charge me with?\nBlackened again, made legible once more\nYour own decree, not permanently writ,\nRightly conceived but all too faintly traced,--\nIt reads efficient, now, comminatory,\nA terror to the wicked, answers so\nThe mood o' the magistrate, the mind of law.\nAbsolve, then, me, law's mere executant!\nProtect your own defender,--save me, Sirs!\nGive me my life, give me my liberty,\nMy good name and my civic rights again!\nIt would be too fond, too complacent play\nInto the hands o' the devil, should we lose\nThe game here, I for God: a soldier-bee\nThat yields his life, exenterate with the stroke\nO' the sting that saves the hive. I need that life,\nOh, never fear! I'll find life plenty use\nThough it should last five years more, aches and all!\nFor, first thing, there's the mother's age to help--\nLet her come break her heart upon my breast,\nNot on the blank stone of my nameless tomb!\nThe fugitive brother has to be bidden back\nTo the old routine, repugnant to the tread,\nOf daily suit and service to the Church,--\nThro' gibe and jest, those stones that Shimei flung!\nAy, and the spirit-broken youth at home,\nThe awe-struck altar-ministrant, shall make\nAmends for faith now palsied at the source,\nShall see truth yet triumphant, justice yet\nA victor in the battle of this world!\nGive me--for last, best gift, my son again,\nWhom law makes mine,--I take him at your word,\nMine be he, by miraculous mercy, lords!\nLet me lift up his youth and innocence\nTo purify my palace, room by room\nPurged of the memories, lend from his bright brow\nLight to the old proud paladin my sire\nShrunk now for shame into the darkest shade\nO' the tapestry, showed him once and shrouds him now!\nThen may we,--strong from that rekindled smile,--\nGo forward, face new times, the better day.\nAnd when, in times made better through your brave\nDecision now,--might but Utopia be!--\nRome rife with honest women and strong men,\nManners reformed, old habits back once more,\nCustoms that recognise the standard worth,--\nThe wholesome household rule in force again,\nHusbands once more God's representative,\nWives like the typical Spouse once more, and Priests\nNo longer men of Belial, with no aim\nAt leading silly women captive, but\nOf rising to such duties as yours now,--\nThen will I set my son at my right hand\nAnd tell his father's story to this point,\nAdding \"The task seemed superhuman, still\n\"I dared and did it, trusting God and law:\n\"And they approved of me: give praise to both!\"\nAnd if, for answer, he shall stoop to kiss\nMy hand, and peradventure start thereat,--\nI engage to smile \"That was an accident\n\"I' the necessary process,--just a trip\n\"O' the torture-irons in their search for truth,--\n\"Hardly misfortune, and no fault at all.\"Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

If he does have cancer I'm gonna win easily\n\n[Marvwon]\nWhy would you fight a person with cancer? Who are you?\n\nThis battle shit is fun, you love it, it's such fun ain't it?\nI've been waiting on this match up longer than a fucking Lush One payment\nI'm underground, but don't mistake me for one of them abstract writers\nI will put mo' people in yo' crib than a Team Backpack Cipher\n{Chokes}\nThis Cal' will push his brim, that's Pat Stay's hat\nI made a living off of these letters, nigga I'm Pat Sajak\nYou are not who comes to mind when I think of that Bay rap\nI will literally kill you to bring Mac Dre back\nThat's Town business\nKing shit, this crown business\nWho in here think Caustic is it?\nWell nigga you in the clown business\nLet's get back to this you writing rounds business\nI heard the story, I said these bars are strange but Danny's a coke head\nAre we really surprised that his lines are 'cane/Arcane?\nYou been mid tier your whole career\nNigga, nothing but a weak spitter\nIn the FreshCoast history books, you are nothing but a seat filler\nI heard it don't take shit to hit yo' bitch\nSome Reggie weed and some cheap liquor\nWith a coaching I heard the bitch make balls magically disappear like a flee flicker\n[Round 2: Caustic]\nSometimes you're kinda good Marv'\nI give the fat man credit\nYou know how I know you're overweight?\n\n[Marvwon]\nHow?\n\n[Caustic]\nCause you fucking snore while you're awake\nYou are going to get 3-0'd by cholesterol, no debate\nAnd you haven't won a battle in fucking forever\nYou been in a drought longer than the fucking Golden State\nY'all wanna hear how fucking disgusting Marv' is?\nHe scavenges for food that others discarded\nTo keep it warm he keeps it tucked under his armpit\nAnd when he gets tired his fucking stomach doubles as an armrest\n\n[Marvwon]\nThat's not even possible. That's not even humanly possible\n\n[Caustic]\nTry it. I double dare you\n\nI mean y'all should be happy\nYou don't get to see someone this fat often\nIt looks like you just had a problem with an assistant manager at a Baskin Robbins\nFucking fat, black, obnoxious\nRunning around looking like Blacktion Bronson\nSo what it really be\nOut here looking like a Mark Henry mini me\nAin't no grilling me, I break him into three parts like a trilogy\nNickle be pointed at his face like a window's peak\nBitch you bigger than a wildebeest\nThat shit will get you fricassed\nI can use your titty meat to feed a million children in the Middle East\nSo what you wanna do tubby?\nYou can't fuck with me I'm too hungry, you too chubby\nI'm six foot, 220, you six foot two of me\nI mean imagine him, at the gym\nTrying to get his abdomen flat again\nBad news buddy it ain't fucking happening\nLast time he got in my car he fucking cracked the rims\nFucking shit beard to the side and cause an accident\nY'all remember the BP oil spill? That was him\nNah I'm bullshitting, you're way too black to swim\nY'all in here thinking that I'm having a friendly match with him\nBut what y'all don't know is that the loser gotta buy dinner\nSo fuck that shit I have to win\n\n[Round 3: Marvwon]\nDuring my research I saw a picture of you and your little man the other day\n....\nWhat? This isn't me choking, that was me being quiet cause I had nothing nice to say\nBut you? You gon' ruin him\nRight now see he's prolly a dreamer\nHe has absolutely no idea that his papi's a tweeker\nBut it's right in front of his face, in black and white\nLike Wally and Beaver\nHe gon' watch dope take his famous parent away like Bobbi Christina\nPeople say Caustic is fake racist\nI said, \"When did the facts switch?\"\nIf he say he in love with the cocoa, it ain't got nothing to do with a black bitch\n\n[Caustic]\nReally?
