"Howard-zinn", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Howard-zinn"}, "artist": "Howard Zinn", "lyrics": "Chapter 22: The Unreported Resistance LyricsIn the early 1990s, a writer for the New Republic magazine, reviewing with approval in the New York Times a book about the influence of dangerously unpatriotic elements among American intellectuals, warned his readers of the existence of \"a permanent adversarial culture\" in the United States\n\nIt was an accurate observation. Despite the political consensus of Democrats and Republicans in Washington which set limits on American reform, making sure that capitalism was in place, that national military strength was maintained, that wealth and power remained in the hands of a few, there were millions of Americans, probably tens of millions, who refused, either actively or silently, to go along. Their activities were largely unreported by the media. They constituted this \"permanent adversarial culture.\"\n\nThe Democratic party was more responsive to these Americans, on whose votes it depended. But its responsiveness was limited by its own captivity to corporate interests, and its domestic reforms were severely limited by the system's dependency on militarism and war. Thus, President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty in the sixties became a victim of the war in Vietnam, and Jimmy Carter could not go far so long as he insisted on a huge outlay of money for the military, much of this to stockpile more nuclear weapons\n\nAs these limits became clear in the Carter years, a small but determined movement against nuclear arms began to grow. The pioneers were a tiny group of Christian pacifists who had been active against the Vietnam war (among them were a former priest, Philip Berrigan, and his wife, Elizabeth McAlister, a former nun). Again and again, members of this group would be arrested for engaging in nonviolent acts of dramatic protest against nuclear war at the Pentagon and the White House\u2014trespassing on forbidden areas, pouring their own blood on symbols of the war machine\n\nIn 1980, small delegations of peace activists from all over the country maintained a series of demonstrations at the Pentagon, in which over a thousand people were arrested for acts of nonviolent civil disobedience\n\nIn September of that year, Philip Berrigan, his brother Daniel (the Jesuit priest and poet), Molly Rush (a mother of six), Anne Montgomery (a nun and counselor to young runaways and prostitutes in Manhattan), and four of their friends made their way past a guard in the General Electric Plant at King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, where nose cones for nuclear missiles were manufactured. They used sledgehammers to smash two of the nose cones and smeared their own blood over missile parts, blueprints, and furniture. Arrested, sentenced to years in prison, they said they were trying to set an example to do as the Bible suggested, to beat swords into plowshares\nThey pointed to the huge allocations of taxpayers' money to corporations producing weaponry: \"G.E. drains $3 million a day from the public treasury-an enormous larceny against the poor.\" Before their trial (they came to be known as the Plowshares Eight), Daniel Berrigan had written in the Catholic Worker\n\nI know of no sure way of predicting where things will go from there, whether others will hear and respond, or how quickly or slowly. Or whether the act will fail to vitalize others, will come to a grinding halt then and there, its actors stigmatized or dismissed as fools. One swallows dry and takes a chance\n\nIn fact, the movement did not come to a halt. Over the next decade, a national movement against nuclear weapons developed, from a small number of men and women willing to go to jail to make others stop and think to millions of Americans frightened at the thought of nuclear holocaust, indignant at the billions of dollars spent on weaponry while people were in need of life's necessities\n\nEven the very Middle-American Pennsylvania jurors who convicted the Plowshares Eight showed remarkable sympathy with their actions. One juror, Michael DeRosa, told a reporter, \"I didn't think they really went to commit a crime. They went to protest.\" Another, Mary Ann Ingram, said the jury argued about that: \"We . . . really didn't want to convict them on anything. But we had to because of the way the judge said the thing you can use is what you get under the law.\" She added: \"These people are not criminals. Here are people who are trying to do some good for the country. But the judge said nuclear power wasn't the issue.\"\n\nReagan's huge military budget was to provoke a national movement against nuclear weapons. In the election of 1980 that brought him into the Presidency, local referenda in three districts in western Massachusetts permitted voters to say whether they believed in a mutual Soviet-American halt to testing, production, and deployment of all nuclear weapons, and wanted Congress to devote those funds instead to civilian use. Two peace groups had worked for months on the campaign and all three districts approved the resolution (94,000 to 65,000), even those that voted for Reagan as President. Similar referenda received majority votes between 1978 and 1981 in San Francisco, Berkeley, Oakland, Madison, and Detroit\n\nWomen were in the forefront of the new antinuclear movement. Randall Forsberg, a young specialist in nuclear arms, organized the Council for a Nuclear Weapons Freeze, whose simple program\u2014a mutual Soviet-American freeze on the production of new nuclear weapons\u2014began to catch on throughout the country. Shortly after Reagan's election, two thousand women assembled in Washington, marched on the Pentagon, and surrounded it in a great circle, linking arms or stretching to hold the ends of brightly colored scarves. One hundred forty women were arrested for blocking the Pentagon entrance\n\nA small group of doctors began to organize meetings around the country to teach citizens the medical consequences of nuclear war. They were the core of the Physicians for Social Responsibility, and Dr. Helen Caldicott, the group's president, became one of the most powerful and eloquent national leaders of the movement. At one of their public symposia, Howard Hiatt, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, gave a graphic description of the results of one twenty-megaton nuclear bomb falling on Boston. Two million people would die. Survivors would be burned, blinded, crippled. In a nuclear war there would be 25 million severe burn cases in the nation, yet all existing facilities could take care of only 200 cases\n\nAt a national meeting of Catholic bishops early in the Reagan administration, the majority opposed any use of nuclear weapons. In November 1981, there were meetings on 151 college campuses around the country on the issue of nuclear war. And at local elections in Boston that month, a resolution calling for increased federal spending on social programs \"by reducing the amount of our tax dollars spent on nuclear weapons and programs of foreign intervention\" won a majority in every one of Boston's twenty-two wards, including both white and black working-class districts\n\nOn June 12, 1982, the largest political demonstration in the history of the country took place in Central Park, New York City. Close to a million people gathered to express their determination to bring an end to the arms race\n\nScientists who had worked on the atom bomb added their voices to the growing movement. George Kistiakowsky, a Harvard University chemistry professor who had worked on the first atomic bomb, and later was science adviser to President Eisenhower, became a spokesman for the disarmament movement. His last public remarks, before his death from cancer at the age of eighty-two, were in an editorial for the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists in December 1982. \"I tell you as my parting words: Forget the channels. There simply is not enough time left before the world explodes. Concentrate instead on organizing, with so many others of like mind, a mass movement for peace such as there has not been before.\"\n\nBy the spring of 1983, the nuclear freeze had been endorsed by 368 city and county councils across the country, by 444 town meetings and 17 state legislatures, and by the House of Representatives. A Harris poll at this time indicated that 79 percent of the population wanted a nuclear freeze agreement with the Soviet Union. Even among evangelical Christians\u2014a group of 40 million people presumed to be conservative and pro-Reagan\u2014a Gallup poll sampling showed 60 percent favoring a nuclear freeze\n\nA year after the great Central Park demonstration, there were over three thousand antiwar groups around the country. And the antinuclear feeling was being reflected in the culture-in books, magazine articles, plays, motion pictures. Jonathan Schells impassioned book against the arms race, The Fate of the Earth, became a national best-seller. A documentary film on the arms race made in Canada was forbidden to enter the country by the Reagan administration, but a federal court ordered it admitted\n\nIn less than three years, there had come about a remarkable change in public opinion. At the time of Reagan's election, nationalist feeling\u2014drummed up by the recent hostage crisis in Iran and by the Russian invasion of Afghanistan\u2014was strong; the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center found that only 12 percent of those it polled thought too much was being spent on arms. But when it took another poll in the spring of 1982, that figure rose to 32 percent. And in the spring of 1983, a New York Time/CBS News poll found that the figure had risen again, to 48 percent\nAntimilitarist feeling expressed itself also in resistance to the draft. When President Jimmy Carter, responding to the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, called for the registration of young men for a military draft, more than 800,000 men (10 percent) failed to register. One mother wrote to the New York Time:\n\nTo the Editor: Thirty-six years ago I stood in front of the crematorium. The ugliest force in the world had promised itself that I should be removed from the cycle of life-that I should never know the pleasure of giving life. With great guns and great hatred, this force thought itself the equal of the force of lift\n\nI survived the great guns, and with every smile of my son, they grow smaller. It is not for me, sir, to offer my son's blood as lubricant for the next generation of guns. I remove myself and my own from the cycle of death\nIsabella Leitner\n\nFormer Nixon aide Alexander Haig warned, in an interview in the French journal Politique Internationale, that there might reappear in the U.S. the conditions that forced President Nixon to stop the draft. \"There is a Jane Fonda on every doorstep,\" he said\n\nOne of the young men who refused to register, James Peters, wrote an open letter to President Carter:\n\nDear Mr. President: On July 23, 1980, I ... am expected to report to my local post office for the purpose of registering with the Selective Service System. I hereby inform you, Mr. President, that I will not register on July 23, or at any time thereafter... . We have tried militarism, and it has failed the human race in every way imaginable\n\nOnce he was in office, Ronald Reagan hesitated to renew draft registration, because, as his Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, explained, \"President Reagan believes that resuming the draft to meet manpower problems would lead to public unrest comparable to that in the sixties and seventies.\" William Beecher, a former Pentagon reporter, wrote in November 1981 that Reagan was \"obviously concerned, even alarmed, by the mounting voices of discontent and suspicion over emerging U.S. nuclear strategy both in the streets of Europe and more recently on American campuses.\"\n\nHoping to intimidate this opposition, the Reagan administration began to prosecute draft resisters. One of those facing prison was Benjamin Sasway, who cited U.S. military intervention in El Salvador as a good reason not to register for the draft\n\nAroused by Sasway's civil disobedience, a right-wing columnist (William A. Rusher, of the National Review) wrote indignantly that one heritage of the sixties was a new generation of antiwar teachers:\n\nAlmost certainly there was a teacher, or teachers, who taught Benjamin Sasway to look at American society as a hypocritical, exploitative, materialistic roadblock on the path of human progress. The generation of the Vietnam protesters is now in its early thirties, and the academicians among them are already ensconced in the faculties of the country's high schools and colleges.... What a pity our jurisprudence doesn't allow us to reach and penalize the real architects of this sort of destruction!\n\nReagan's policy of giving military aid to the dictatorship of El Salvador was not accepted quietly around the nation. He had barely taken office when the following report appeared in the Boston Globe:\n\nIt was a scene reminiscent of the 1960s, a rally of students in Harvard Yard shouting antiwar slogans, a candlelight march through the streets of Cambridge.. .. 2000 persons, mostly students, gathered to protest U.S. involvement in El Salvador... . Students from Tufts, MIT, Boston University and Boston College, the University of Massachusetts, Brandeis, Suffolk, Dartmouth, Northeastern, Vassar, Yale and Simmons were represented\n\nDuring commencement exercises that spring of 1981 at Syracuse University, when Reagan's Secretary of State, Alexander Haig, was given an honorary doctorate in \"public service,\" two hundred students and faculty turned their backs on the presentation. During Haig's address, the press reported, \"Nearly every pause in Mr. Haig's fifteen-minute address was punctuated by chants: 'Human needs, not military greed!' 'Get out of El Salvador!' 'Washington guns killed American nuns!'\"\nThe last slogan was a reference to the execution in the fall of 1980 of four American nuns by Salvadoran soldiers. Thousands of people in El Salvador were being murdered each year by \"death squads\" sponsored by a government armed by the United States, and the American public was beginning to pay attention to events in this tiny Central American country\n\nAs has been true generally in the making of U.S. foreign policy, there was no pretense at democracy. Public opinion was simply ignored. A New York Time/CBS News poll in the spring of 1982 reported that only 16 percent of its sampling favored Reagan's program of sending military and economic aid to El Salvador\n\nIn the spring of 1983, it was disclosed that an American physician named Charles Clement was working with the Salvadoran rebels. As an Air Force pilot in Southeast Asia, he had become disillusioned with U.S. policy there, having seen firsthand that his government was lying, and refused to fly any more missions. The Air Force response was to commit him to a psychiatric hospital, then to discharge him as psychologically unfit. He went to medical school, and then volunteered to be a doctor with the guerrillas in El Salvador\n\nThere was much talk in the American press in the early eighties about the political cautiousness of a new generation of college students concerned mostly with their own careers. But when, at the Harvard commencement of June 1983, Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes criticized American intervention in Latin America, and said, \"Because we are your true friends, we will not permit you to conduct yourselves in Latin American affairs as the Soviet Union conducts itself in Central European and Central Asian affairs,\" he was interrupted twenty times by applause and received a standing ovation when finished\n\nAmong my own students at Boston University, I did not find the pervasive selfishness and unconcern with others that the media kept reporting, in deadening repetition, about the students of the eighties. In the journals they kept, I found the following comments:\n\nA male student: \"Do you think anything good that has happened in the world had anything to do with government? I work in Roxbury [a black neighborhood]. I know the government doesn't work. Not for the people of Roxbury, and not for the people anywhere. It works for people with money.\"\n\nA graduate of a Catholic high school: \"America to me is a society, a culture. America is my home; if someone were to rob that culture from me, then perhaps there would be reason to resist. I will not die, however, to defend the honor of the government.\"\n\nA young woman: \"As a white middle class person I've never felt discriminated against at all. But I'll say this: If anyone ever tried to make me sit in a different schoolroom, use a different bathroom, or anything like that, I would knock them right on their ass.. . . The people are the last ones that need their rights stated on paper, for if they're abused or injusticed by government or authority, they can act on the injustice directly.. . . When you look at the ... statements of rights and laws, it's really government and authority and institutions and corporations that need laws and rights to insulate them from the physicality, the directness of the people.\"\n\nBeyond the campuses, out in the country, there was opposition to government policy, not widely known. A report from Tucson, Arizona, early in the Reagan presidency described \"demonstrators, mainly middle-aged,\" protesting at the Federal Building against U.S. involvement in El Salvador. Over a thousand people in Tucson marched in a procession and attended a mass to commemorate the anniversary of the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero, who had spoken out against the Salvadoran death squads\n\nOver 60,000 Americans signed pledges to take action of some sort, including civil disobedience, if Reagan moved to invade Nicaragua. When the President instituted a blockade of the tiny country to try to force its government out of power, there were demonstrations around the country. In Boston alone, 550 people were arrested protesting the blockade\n\nDuring Reagan's presidency, there were hundreds of actions throughout the nation against his policies in South Africa. He obviously did not want to see the white ruling minority of South Africa displaced by the radical African National Congress, which represented the black majority. Chester Crocker, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, in his memoirs, called Reagan \"insensitive\" to the conditions under which blacks lived there. Public opinion was strong enough to cause Congress to legislate economic sanctions against the South African Government in 1986, overriding Reagan's veto\n\nReagan's cuts in social services were felt on the local level as vital needs could not he taken care of, and there were angry reactions. In the spring and summer of 1981, residents of East Boston took to the streets; for fifty-five nights they blocked major thoroughfares and the Sumner Tunnel during rush hour, in order to protest cutbacks in funds for fire, police, and teachers. The police superintendent, John Doyle, said: \"Maybe these people are starting to take lessons from the protests of the sixties and seventies.\" The Boston Globe reported: \"The demonstrators in East Boston were mostly middle-aged, middle- or working-class people who said they had never protested anything before.\"\n\nThe Reagan administration took away federal funds for the arts, suggesting that the performing arts seek help from private donors. In New York, two historic Broadway theaters were razed to make way for a luxury fifty-story hotel, after two hundred theater people demonstrated, picketing, reading plays and singing songs, refusing to disperse when ordered by police. Some of the nation's best-known theater personalities were arrested, including producer Joseph Papp, actresses Tammy Grimes, Estelle Parsons, and Celeste Holm, actors Richard Gere and Michael Moriarty\n\nThe budget cuts spurred strikes across the country, often by groups unaccustomed to striking. In the fall of 1982, United Press International reported:\n\nAngered by layoffs, salary cuts and uncertainty about job security, more schoolteachers throughout the country have decided to go on strike. Teachers' strikes last week in seven states, from Rhode Island to Washington, have idled more than 300,000 students\n\nSurveying a series of news events in the first week of January 1983, David Nyhan of the Boston Globe wrote: \"There is something brewing in the land that bodes ill for those in Washington who ignore it. People have moved from the frightened state to the angry stage and are acting out their frustrations in ways that will test the fabric of civil order.\" He gave some examples:\n\nIn Little Washington, Pennsylvania, in early 1983, when a 50-year-old computer science teacher who led a teachers' strike was sent to jail, 2000 people demonstrated outside the jailhouse in his support, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called it \"the largest crowd in Washington County since the 1794 Whiskey Rebellion.\"\n\nWhen unemployed or bankrupt home owners in the Pittsburgh area could no longer make mortgage payments, and foreclosure sales were scheduled, 60 pickets jammed the courthouse to protest the auction, and Allegheny sheriff Eugene Coon halted the proceedings\n\nThe foreclosure of a 320-acre wheat farm in Springfield, Colorado, was interrupted by 200 angry farmers, who had to be dispersed by tear gas and Mace\n\nWhen Reagan arrived in Pittsburgh in April 1983 to make a speech, 3000 people, many of them unemployed steelworkers, demonstrated against him, standing in the rain outside his hotel. Demonstrations by the unemployed were taking place in Detroit, Flint, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Washington\u2014over twenty cities in all\n\nJust around that time, Miami blacks rioted against police brutality; they were reacting against their general deprivation as well. The unemployment rate among young African-Americans had risen above 50 percent, and the Reagan administration's only response to poverty was to build more jails. Understanding that blacks would not vote for him, Reagan tried, unsuccessfully, to get Congress to eliminate a crucial section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which had been very effective in safeguarding the right of blacks to vote in Southern states\n\nReagan's policies clearly joined the two issues of disarmament and social welfare. It was guns versus children, and this was expressed dramatically by the head of the Children's Defense Fund, Marian Wright Edelman, in a commencement speech at the Milton Academy in Massachusetts in the summer of 1983:\n\nYou are graduating into a nation and world teetering on the brink of moral and economic bankruptcy. Since 1980, our President and Congress have been turning our national plowshares into swords and been bringing good news to the rich at the expense of the poor. .. . Children are the major victims. Our misguided national and world choices are literally killing children daily.... Yet governments throughout the world, led by our own, spend over $600 billion a year on arms, while an estimated 1 billion of our world's people live in poverty and 600 million are under- or unemployed. Where is the human commitment and political will to find the relative pittance of money needed to protect children?\n\nShe urged her listeners: \"Pick a piece of the problem that you can help solve while trying to see how your piece fits into the broader social change puzzle.\"\n\nHer words seemed to represent a growing mood that worried the Reagan administration. It withdrew some of its proposed cutbacks, and Congress eliminated others. When, in its second year, the administration proposed $9 billion in cuts in support for children and poor families, Congress accepted only $1 billion. The Washington correspondent of the New York Time reported: \"Political concerns about the fairness of Mr. Reagan's programs have forced the Administration to curtail its efforts to make further cutbacks in programs for the poor.\"\n\nThe repeated elections of Republican candidates, Reagan in 1980 and 1984, George Bush in 1988, were treated by the press with words like \"landslide\" and \"overwhelming victory.\" They were ignoring four facts: that roughly half the population, though eligible to vote, did not; that those who did vote were limited severely in their choices to the two parties that monopolized the money and the media; that as a result many of their votes were cast without enthusiasm; and that there was little relationship between voting for a candidate and voting for specific policies\n\nIn 1980 Reagan received 51.6 percent of the popular vote, while Jimmy Carter received 41.7 percent and John Anderson (a liberal Republican running on a third-party ticket) received 6.7 percent. Only 54 percent of the voting-age population voted, so that\u2014of the total eligible to vote\u201427 percent voted for Reagan\n\nA survey by the New York Time found that only 11 percent of those who voted for Reagan did so because \"he's a real conservative.\" Three times as many said they voted for him because \"it is time for a change.\"\n\nFor a second term, running against former Vice-President Walter Mondale, Reagan won 59 percent of the popular vote, but with half the electorate not voting, he had 29 percent of the voting population\n\nIn the 1988 election, with Vice-President George Bush running against Democrat Michael Dukakis, Bush's 54 percent victory added up to 27 percent of the eligible voters\n\nBecause our peculiar voting arrangements allow a small margin of popular votes to become a huge majority of electoral votes, the media can talk about \"overwhelming victory,\" thus deceiving their readers and disheartening those who don't look closely at the statistics. Could one say from these figures that \"the American people\" wanted Reagan, or Bush, as President? One could certainly say that more voters preferred the Republican candidates to their opponents. But even more seemed to want neither candidate. Nevertheless, on the basis of these slim electoral pluralities, Reagan and Bush would claim that \"the people\" had spoken\n\nIndeed, when the people did speak about issues, in surveys of public opinion, they expressed beliefs to which neither the Republican nor Democratic parties paid attention\n\nFor instance, both parties, through the eighties and early nineties, kept strict limits on social programs for the poor, on the grounds that this would require more taxes, and \"the people\" did not want higher taxes\n\nThis was certainly true as a general proposition, that Americans wanted to pay as little in taxes as possible. But when they were asked if they would be willing to pay higher taxes for specific purposes like health and education, they said yes, they would. For instance, a 1990 poll of Boston area voters showed that 54 percent of them would pay more taxes if that would go toward cleaning up the environment\n\nAnd when higher taxes were presented in class terms, rather than as a general proposal, people were quite clear. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll in December 1990 showed that 84 percent of the respondents favored a surtax on millionaires (this provision was dropped around that time from a Democratic-Republican budget compromise). Even though 51 percent of the respondents were in favor of raising the capital gains tax, neither major party favored that\n\nA Harris/Harvard School of Public Health poll of 1989 showed that most Americans (61 percent) favored a Canadian-type health system, in which the government was the single payer to doctors and hospitals, bypassing the insurance companies, and offering universal medical coverage to everyone. Neither the Democratic nor the Republican party adopted that as its program, although both insisted they wanted to \"reform\" the health system\n\nA survey by the Gordon Black Corporation for the National Press Club in 1992 found that 59 percent of all voters wanted a 50 percent cut in defense spending in five years. Neither of the major parties was willing to make major cuts in the military budget\n\nHow the public felt about government aid to the poor seemed to depend on how the question was put. Both parties, and the media, talked incessantly about the \"welfare\" system, that it was not working, and the word \"welfare\" became a signal for opposition. When people were asked (a New York Times/CBS News poll of 1992) if more money should he allocated to welfare, 23 percent said no. But when the same people were asked, should the government help the poor, 64 percent said yes\n\nThis was a recurring theme. When, at the height of the Reagan presidency, in 1987, people were asked if the government should guarantee food and shelter to needy people, 62 percent answered yes\n\nClearly, there was something amiss with a political system, supposed to be democratic, in which the desires of the voters were repeatedly ignored. They could be ignored with impunity so long as the political system was dominated by two parties, both tied to corporate wealth. An electorate forced to choose between Carter and Reagan, or Reagan and Mondale, or Bush and Dukakis could only despair (or decide not to vote) because neither candidate was capable of dealing with a fundamental economic illness whose roots were deeper than any single presidency\n\nThat illness came from a fact which was almost never talked about: that the United States was a class society, in which I percent of the population owned 33 percent of the wealth, with an underclass of 30 to 40 million people living in poverty. The social programs of the sixties- Medicare and Medicaid, food stamps, etc.-did not do much more than maintain the historic American maldistribution of resources\n\nWhile the Democrats would give more help to the poor than the Republicans, they were not capable (indeed, not really desirous) of seriously tampering with an economic system in which corporate profit comes before human need\n\nThere was no important national movement for radical change, no social democratic (or democratic socialist) party such as existed in countries in Western Europe, Canada, and New Zealand. But there were a thousand signs of alienation, voices of protest, local actions in every part of the country to call attention to deep-felt grievances, to demand that some injustice be remedied\n\nFor instance, the Citizens' Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes in Washington, D.C., which had been formed early in the Reagan administration by housewife and activist Lois Gibbs, reported that it was giving help to 8000 local groups around the country. One of these groups, in Oregon, brought a series of successful lawsuits to force the Environmental Protection Agency to do something about unsafe drinking water in the Bull Run reservoir near Portland\n\nIn Seabrook, New Hampshire, there were years of persistent protest against a nuclear power plant which residents considered a danger to themselves and their families. Between 1977 and 1989, over 3500 people were arrested in these protests. Ultimately, the plant, plagued by financial problems and opposition, had to shut down\n\nFear of nuclear accidents was intensified by disastrous events at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979 and by an especially frightening calamity in Chernobyl in the Soviet Union in 1986. All of this was having an effect on the once-booming nuclear industry. By 1994, the Tennessee Valley Authority had stopped the construction of three nuclear plants, which the New York Time called \"the symbolic death notice for the current generation of reactors in the United States.\"\n\nIn Minneapolis, Minnesota, thousands of people demonstrated year after year against the Honeywell Corporation's military contracts, and between 1982 and 1988 over 1800 people were arrested\n\nFurthermore, when those who engaged in such civil disobedience were brought into court, they often found sympathetic support from juries, winning acquittals from ordinary citizens who seemed to understand that even if they had technically broken the law, they had done so in a good cause\n\nIn 1984, a group of Vermont citizens (the \"Winooski Forty-four\") refused to leave the hallway outside a U.S. Senator's office, protesting his votes to give arms to the Nicaraguan contras. They were arrested, but at their trial they were treated sympathetically by the judge and acquitted by the jury\n\nAt another trial shortly after, a number of people (including activist Abbie Hoffman and Amy Carter, daughter of former President Jimmy Carter) were charged with blocking CIA recruiters at the University of Massachusetts. They called to the witness stand ex-CIA agents who told the jury that the CIA had engaged in illegal and murderous activities all around the world. The jury acquitted them\n\nOne juror, a woman hospital worker, said later: \"I was not familiar with the CIA's activities.... I was shocked.... I was kind of proud of the students.\" Another juror said: \"It was very educational.\" The county district attorney, prosecuting the case, concluded: \"If there is a message, it was that this jury was composed of middle America.. .. Middle America doesn't want the CIA doing what they are doing.\"\n\nIn the South, while there was no great movement comparable to the civil rights movement of the Sixties, there were hundreds of local groups organizing poor people, white and black. In North Carolina, Linda Stout, the daughter of a mill worker who had died of industrial poisons, coordinated a multiracial network of 500 textile workers, farmers, maids\u2014most of them low-income women of color\u2014in the Piedmont Peace Project\n\nThe historic Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, which had nurtured so many black and white activists throughout the South, was now joined by other folk schools and popular education centers\n\nAnne Braden, a veteran of racial and labor struggles in the South, was still organizing, leading the Southern Organizing Committee for Economic and Social Justice. The group gave help in local actions: to 300 African-Americans in Tift County, Georgia, who were protesting the existence of a chemical plant which was making them sick; to Native Americans in Cherokee County, North Carolina, who were organizing to stop a polluted landfill\n\nBack in the sixties, Chicane farm workers, people of Mexican descent who came to work and live mostly in California and the Southwestern states, rebelled against their feudal working conditions. They went out on strike and organized a national boycott of grapes, under the leadership of Cesar Chavez. Soon farmworkers were organizing in other parts of the country\n\nIn the seventies and eighties, their struggles against poverty and discrimination continued. The Reagan years hit them hard, as it did poor people all over the country. By 1984, 42 percent of all Latino children and one-fourth of the families lived below the poverty line\n\nCopper miners in Arizona, mostly Mexican, went on strike against the Phelps-Dodge company after it cut wages, benefits, and safety measures in 1983. They were attacked by National Guardsmen and state troopers, by tear gas and helicopters, but held out for three years until a combination of governmental and corporate power finally defeated them\n\nThere were victories too. In 1985, 1700 cannery workers, most of them Mexican women, went on strike in Watsonville, California, and won a union contract with medical benefits. In 1990 workers who had been laid off from the Levi Strauss company in San Antonio because the company was moving to Costa Rica called a boycott, organized a hunger strike, and won concessions. In Los Angeles, Latino janitors went on strike in 1990 and despite police attacks, won recognition of their union, a pay raise, and sick benefits\n\nLatino and Latina activists (not necessarily Chicano, which refers to those of Mexican ancestry), through the eighties and early nineties, campaigned for better labor conditions, for representation in local government, for tenants' rights, for bilingual education in the schools. Kept out of the media, they organized a bilingual radio movement, and by 1991 had fourteen Latino stations in the country, twelve of them bilingual\n\nIn New Mexico, Latinos fought for land and water rights against real estate developers who tried to throw them off land they had lived on for decades. In 1988 there was a confrontation, and the people organized an armed occupation, built bunkers for protection against attack, and won support from other communities in the Southwest; finally, a court ruled in their favor\n\nAbnormal rates of cancer for farmworkers in California aroused the Chicano community. Cesar Chavez of the United Farm Workers fasted for thirty-five days in 1988 to call attention to these conditions. There were now United Farm Workers unions in Texas, Arizona, and other states\n\nThe importation of Mexican workers for low wages, under terrible conditions, spread from the Southwest to other parts of the country. By 1991, 80,000 Latinos lived in North Carolina, 30,000 in north Georgia. The Farm Labor Organizing Committee, which had won a difficult strike in the Ohio tomato fields in 1979, the largest agricultural strike ever in the Midwest, brought thousands of farmworkers together in several Midwest states\n\nAs the Latino population of the country kept growing, it soon matched the 12 percent of the population that was African-American and began to have a distinct effect on American culture. Much of its music, art, and drama was much more consciously political and satirical than mainstream culture\n\nThe Border Arts workshop was formed in 1984 by artists and writers in San Diego and Tijuana, and its work dealt powerfully with issues of racism and injustice. In Northern California, Teatro Campesino and Teatro de la Esperanza performed for working people all over the country, turning schoolhouses, churches, and fields into theaters\n\nLatinos were especially conscious of the imperial role the United States had played in Mexico and the Caribbean, and many of them became militant critics of U.S. policy toward Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Cuba. In 1970 a great march in Los Angeles against the Vietnam war, which had been attacked by police, left three Chicanos dead\n\nWhen the Bush administration was preparing for war against Iraq in the summer of 1990, thousands of people in Los Angeles marched along the same route they had taken twenty years before, when they were protesting the Vietnam war. As Elizabeth Martinez wrote (500 Years of Chicano History in Pictures):\n\nBefore and during President Bush's war in the Persian Gulf many people- including Raza [literally \"race\"; a term adopted by Latino activists]-had doubts about it or were opposed. We had learned some lessons about wars started in the name of democracy that turned out to benefit only the rich and powerful. Raza mobilized to protest this war of mass murder, even faster than the U.S. war in Vietnam, though we could not stop it\n\nIn 1992, a fund-raising group which came out of the Vietnam war called Resist made donations to 168 organizations around the country- community groups, peace groups, Native American groups, prisoners' rights organizations, health and environmental groups\n\nA new generation of lawyers, schooled in the sixties, constituted a small but socially conscious minority within the legal profession. They were in court defending the poor and the helpless, or bringing suit against powerful corporations. One law firm used its talent and energy to defend whistleblowers\u2014men and women who were fired because they \"blew the whistle\" on corporate corruption that victimized the public\n\nThe women's movement, which had managed to raise the consciousness of the whole nation on the issue of sexual equality, faced a powerful backlash in the eighties. The Supreme Court's defense of abortion rights in its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision aroused a pro-life movement that had strong supporters in Washington. Congress passed, and the Supreme Court later let stand, a law that eliminated federal medical benefits to help poor women pay for abortions. But the National Organization of Women and other groups remained strong; in 1989, a Washington rally for what had come to be known as the right to choose drew over 300,000 people. When, in 1994 and 1995, abortion clinics were attacked and several supporters murdered, the conflict became grimly intense\n\nThe rights of gay and lesbian Americans had come vividly to the forefront in the Seventies with radical changes in ideas about sexuality and freedom. The gay movement then became a visible presence in the nation, with parades, demonstrations, campaigns for the elimination of state statutes discriminating against homosexuals. One result was a growing literature about the hidden history of gay life in the United States and in Europe\n\nIn 1994, there was a Stonewall 25 march in Manhattan, which commemorated an event homosexuals regarded as a turning point: twenty-five years earlier, gay men fought back vigorously against a police raid on the Stonewall bar in Greenwich Village. In the early nineties, gay and lesbian groups campaigned more openly, more determinedly, against discrimination, and for more attention to the scourge of AIDS, which they claimed was being given only marginal attention by the national government\n\nIn Rochester, New York, a local campaign achieved an unprecedented decision barring military recruiters from a school district because of the Defense Department discrimination against gay soldiers\n\nThe labor movement in the eighties and nineties was considerably weakened by the decline of manufacturing, by the flight of factories to other countries, by the hostility of the Reagan administration and its appointees on the National Labor Relations Board. Yet organizing continued, especially among white collar workers and low-income people of color. The AFL-CIO put on hundreds of new organizers to work among Latinos, African-Americans, and Asian-Americans\n\nRank-and-file workers in old, stagnant unions began to rebel. In 1991, the notoriously corrupt leadership of the powerful Teamsters Union was voted out of office by a reform slate. The new leadership immediately became a force in Washington, and took the lead in working for independent political coalitions outside the two major parties. But the labor movement as a whole, much diminished, was struggling for survival\n\nAgainst the overwhelming power of corporate wealth and governmental authority, the spirit of resistance was kept alive in the early nineties, often by small-scale acts of courage and defiance. On the West Coast, a young activist named Keith McHenry and hundreds of others were arrested again and again for distributing free food to poor people without a license. They were part of a program called Food Not Bombs. More Food Not Bombs groups sprang up in communities around the country\n\nIn 1992, a New York group interested in revising traditional ideas about American history received approval from the New York City Council to put up thirty metal plaques high on lampposts around the city. One of them, placed opposite the Morgan corporate headquarters, identified the famous banker J.P. Morgan as a Civil War \"draft dodger.\" In fact, Morgan had avoided the draft and profited in business deals with the government during the war. Another plaque, placed near the Stock Exchange, portrayed a suicide and carried the label \"Advantage of an Unregulated Free Market.\"\n\nThe general disillusionment with government during the Vietnam years and the Watergate scandals, the exposure of anti-democratic actions by the FBI and the CIA, led to resignations from government and open criticism by former employees\n\nA number of former CIA officials left the agency, and wrote books critical of its activities. John Stockwell, who had headed the CIA operation in Angola, resigned, wrote a hook exposing the CIA's activities, and lectured all over the country about his experiences. David MacMichael, a historian and former CIA specialist, testified at trials on behalf of people who had protested government policy in Central America\n\nFBI Agent Jack Ryan, a twenty-one-year veteran of the bureau, was fired when he refused to investigate peace groups. He was deprived of his pension and for some time had to live in a shelter for homeless people\n\nSometimes the war in Vietnam, which had ended in 1975, came back to public attention in the eighties and nineties through people who had been involved in the conflicts of that day. Some of them had since made dramatic turnabouts in their thinking. John Wall, who prosecuted Dr. Benjamin Spock and four others in Boston for \"conspiring\" to obstruct the draft, showed up at a dinner honoring the defendants in 1994, saying the trial had changed his ideas\n\nEven more striking was the statement by Charles Hutto, a U.S. soldier who had participated in the atrocity known as the My Lai massacre, in which a company of American soldiers shot to death women and children by the hundreds in a tiny Vietnamese village. Interviewed in the eighties, Hutto told a reporter:\n\nI was nineteen years old, and I'd always been told to do what the grown-ups told me to do. , . . But now I'll tell my sons, if the government calls, to go, to serve their country, but to use their own judgment at times ... to forget about authority ... to use their own conscience. I wish somebody had told me that before I went to Vietnam. I didn't know. Now I don't think there should be even a thing called war ... cause it messes up a person's mind\n\nIt was this legacy of the Vietnam war-the feeling among a great majority of Americans that it was a terrible tragedy, a war that should not have been fought-that plagued the Reagan and Bush administrations, which still hoped to extend American power around the world\n\nIn 1985, when George Bush was Vice-President, former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger had warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: \"Vietnam brought a sea change in domestic attitudes ... a breakdown in the political consensus behind foreign policy. . ..\"\n\nWhen Bush became President, he was determined to overcome what came to be called the Vietnam syndrome-the resistance of the American people to a war desired by the Establishment. And so, he launched the air war against Iraq in mid-January 1991 with overwhelming force, so the war could be over quickly, before there was time for a national antiwar movement to develop\n\nThe signs of a possible movement were there in the months of the prewar buildup. On Halloween, 600 students marched through downtown Missoula, Montana, shouting \"Hell no, we won't go!\" In Shreveport, Louisiana, despite the Shreveport Journal's front-page headline: \"Poll Favors Military Action,\" the story was that 42 percent of the respondents thought the U.S. should \"initiate force\" and 41 percent said \"wait and see.\"\n\nThe November 11, 1990, Veterans Parade in Boston was joined by a group called Veterans for Peace, carrying signs: \"No More Vietnams. Bring 'Em Home Now\" and \"Oil and Blood Do Not Mix, Wage Peace.\" The Boston Globe reported that \"the protesters were greeted with respectful applause and, at some places, strong demonstrations of support by onlookers.\" One of those onlookers, a woman named Mary Belle Dressier, said: \"Personally, parades that honor the military are somewhat troublesome to me because the military is about war, and war is troublesome to me.\"\n\nMost Vietnam veterans were supporting military action, but there was a strong dissident minority. In one survey that showed 53 percent of the veterans polled saying they would gladly serve in the Gulf War, 37 percent said they would not\n\nPerhaps the most famous Vietnam veteran, Ron Kovic, author of Born on the Fourth of July, made a thirty-second television speech as Bush moved toward war. In the appeal, broadcast on 200 television stations in 120 cities across the country, he asked all citizens to \"stand up and speak out\" against war. \"How many more Americans coming home in wheelchairs\u2014like me\u2014will it take before we learn?\"\n\nThat November of 1990, several months into the Kuwait crisis, college students in St. Paul, Minnesota, demonstrated against war. The local press reported:\n\nIt was a full-blown antiwar demonstration with mothers pushing kids in strollers, college professors and grade school teachers carrying signs, peace activists bedecked in peace symbols, and hundreds of students from a dozen schools singing, beating drums and chanting, \"Hey, hey, ho ho, we won't fight for Amoco.\"\n\nTen days before the bombing began, at a town meeting in Boulder, Colorado, with 800 people present, the question was put: \"Do you support Bush's policy for war?\" Only four people raised their hands. A few days before the war began, 4100 people in Santa Fe, New Mexico, blocked a four-lane highway for an hour, asking that there be no war. Residents said this was larger than any demonstration in the Vietnam era\n\nOn the eve of war, 6000 people marched through Ann Arbor, Michigan, to ask for peace. On the night the war began, 5000 people gathered in San Francisco to denounce the war and formed a human chain around the Federal Building. Police broke the chain by swinging their clubs at the hands of the protesters. But the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution declaring the city and county a sanctuary for those who for \"moral, ethical or religious reasons cannot participate in war.\"\n\nThe night before Bush gave the order to launch the bombing, a seven-year-old girl in Lexington, Massachusetts, told her mother she wanted to write a letter to the President. Her mother suggested it was late and she should write the next day. \"No, tonight,\" the girl said. She was still learning to write, so she dictated a letter:\n\nDear President Bush. I don't like the way you are behaving. If you would make up your mind there won't be a war we won't have to have peace vigils. If you were in a war you wouldn't want to get hurt. What I'm saying is: I don't want any fighting to happen. Sincerely yours, Serena Kabat\n\nAfter the bombing of Iraq began along with the bombardment of public opinion, the polls showed overwhelming support for Bush's action, and this continued through the six weeks of the war. But was it an accurate reflection of the citizenry's long-term feelings about war? The split vote in the polls just before the war reflected a public still thinking its opinion might have an effect. Once the war was on, and clearly irreversible, in an atmosphere charged with patriotic fervor (the president of the United Church of Christ spoke of \"the steady drumbeat of war messages\"), it was not surprising that a great majority of the country would declare its support\n\nNevertheless, even with little time to organize, and with the war over very fast, there was an opposition-a minority for sure, but a determined one, and with the potential to grow. Compared to the first months of the military escalation in Vietnam, the movement against the Gulf War expanded with extraordinary speed and vigor\n\nThat first week of the war, while it was clear most Americans were supporting Bush's action, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in protest, in towns and cities all over the country. In Athens, Ohio, over 100 people were arrested, as they clashed with a prowar group. In Portland, Maine, 500 marched wearing white arm bands or carrying white paper crosses with one word, \"Why?,\" written in red\n\nAt the University of Georgia, 70 students opposed to the war held an all-night vigil, and in the Georgia Legislature, Representative Cynthia McKinnon made a speech attacking the bombing of Iraq, leading many of the other legislators to walk off the floor. She held her ground, and it seemed that there had been at least some change In thinking since Representative Julian Bond was expelled from the very same legislature for criticizing the war in Vietnam during the 1960s. At a junior high school in Newton, Massachusetts, 350 students marched to city hall to present a petition to the mayor declaring their opposition to the war in the Gulf. Clearly, many were trying to reconcile their feelings about war with their sympathy for soldiers sent to the Middle East. A student leader, Carly Baker, said: \"We don't think bloodshed is the right way. We are supporting the troops and are proud of them, but we don't want war.\"\n\nIn Ada, Oklahoma, while East Central Oklahoma State University was \"adopting\" two National Guard units, two young women sat quietly on top of the concrete entrance gate with signs that read \"Teach Peace ... Not War.\" One of them, Patricia Biggs, said: \"I don't think we should be over there. I don't think it's about justice and liberty, I think it's about economics. The big oil corporations have a lot to do with what is going on over there. . . . We are risking people's lives for money.\"\n\nFour days after the United States launched its air attack, 75,000 people (the estimate of the Capitol Police) marched in Washington, rallying near the White House to denounce the war. In Southern California, Ron Kovic addressed 6000 people who chanted \"Peace Now!\" In Fayetteville, Arkansas, a group supporting military policy was confronted by the Northwest Arkansas Citizens Against War, who marched carrying a flag-draped coffin and a banner that read \"Bring Them Home Alive.\"\n\nAnother disabled Vietnam veteran, a professor of history and political science at York College in Pennsylvania named Philip Avillo, wrote in a local newspaper: \"Yes, we need to support our men and women under arms. But let's support them by bringing them home; not by condoning this barbarous, violent policy.\" In Salt Lake City, hundreds of demonstrators, many with children, marched through the city's main streets chanting antiwar slogans\n\nIn Vermont, which had just elected Socialist Bernie Sanders to Congress, over 2000 demonstrators disrupted a speech by the governor at the state house, and in Burlington, Vermont's largest city, 300 protesters walked through the downtown area, asking shop owners to close their doors in solidarity\n\nOn January 26, nine days after the beginning of the war, over 150,000 people marched through the streets of Washington, D.C., and listened to speakers denounce the war, including the movie stars Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins. A woman from Oakland, California, held up the folded American flag that was given to her when her husband was killed in Vietnam, saying, \"I learned the hard way there is no glory in a folded flag.\"\n\nLabor unions had supported the war in Vietnam for the most part, but after the bombing started in the Gulf, eleven affiliates of the AFL-CIO, including some of its more powerful unions\u2014like steel, auto, communications, chemical workers\u2014spoke out against the war\n\nThe black community was far less enthusiastic than the rest of the country about what the U.S. Air Force was doing to Iraq. An ABC News/Washington Post poll in early February, 1991, found that support for the war was 84 percent among whites, but only 48 percent among African-Americans\n\nWhen the war had been going on for a month, with Iraq devastated by the incessant bombing, there were feelers from Saddam Hussein that Iraq would withdraw from Kuwait if the United States would stop its attacks. Bush rejected the idea, and a meeting of black leaders in New York sharply criticized him, calling the war \"an immoral and unspiritual diversion ... a blatant evasion of our domestic responsibilities.\"\n\nIn Selma, Alabama, which had been the scene of bloody police violence against civil rights marchers twenty-six years before, a meeting to observe the anniversary of that \"bloody Sunday\" demanded that \"our troops be brought home alive to fight for justice at home.\"\n\nThe father of a twenty-one-year-old Marine in the Persian Gulf, Alex Molnar, wrote an angry open letter, published in the New York Time, to President Bush:\n\nWhere were you, Mr. President, when Iraq was killing its own people with poison gas? Why, until the recent crisis, was it business as usual with Saddam Hussein, the man you now call a Hitler? Is the American \"way of life\" that you say my son is risking his life for the continued \"right\" of Americans to consume 25 to 30 percent of the world's oil? ... I intend to support my son and his fellow soldiers by doing everything I can to oppose any offensive American military action in the Persian Gulf\n\nThere were courageous individual acts by citizens, speaking out in spite of threats\n\nPeg Mullen, of Brownsville, Texas, whose son had been killed by \"friendly fire\" in Vietnam, organized a busload of mothers to protest in Washington, in spite of a warning that her house would be burned down if she persisted\n\nThe actress Margot Kidder (\"Lois Lane\" in the Superman films), despite the risk to her career, spoke out eloquently against the war\n\nA basketball player for Seton Hall University in New Jersey refused to wear the American flag on his uniform, and when he became the object of derision for this, he left the team and the university, and returned to his native Italy\n\nMore tragically, a Vietnam veteran in Los Angeles set fire to himself and died, to protest the war\n\nIn Amherst, Massachusetts, a young man carrying a cardboard peace sign knelt on the town common, poured two cans of flammable fluid on himself, struck two matches, and died in the flames. Two hours later, students from nearby universities gathered on the common for a candlelight vigil, and placed peace signs at the site of death. One of the signs read, \"Stop this crazy war.\"\n\nThere was no time, as there had been during the Vietnam conflict, for a large antiwar movement to develop in the military. But there were men and women who defied their commanders and refused to participate in the war\n\nWhen the first contingents of U.S. troops were being sent to Saudi Arabia, in August of 1990, Corporal Jeff Patterson, a twenty-two-year-old Marine stationed in Hawaii, sat down on the runway of the airfield and refused to board a plane bound for Saudi Arabia. He asked to be discharged from the Marine Corps:\n\nI have come to believe that there are no justified wars.... I began to question exactly what I was doing in the Marine Corps about the time I began to read about history. I began to read up on America's support for the murderous regimes of Guatemala, Iran under the Shah, and El Salvador.... I object to the military use of force against any people, anywhere, any time\n\nFourteen Marine Corps reservists at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, filed for conscientious objector status, despite the prospect of a court-martial for desertion. A lance corporal in the Marines, Erik Larsen, issued a statement:\n\nI declare myself a conscientious objector. Here is my sea bag full of personal gear. Here is my gas mask. I no longer need them. I am no longer a Marine. ... It, to me, is embarrassing to fight for a way of life in which basic human needs, like a place to sleep, one hot meal a day and some medical attention, cannot even be met in our nation's capital\n\nCorporal Yolanda Huet-Vaughn, a physician who was a captain in the Army Reserve Medical Corps, a mother of three young children, and a member of the Physicians for Social Responsibility, was called to active duty in December 1990, a month before the start of the war. She replied: \"I am refusing orders to be an accomplice in what I consider an immoral, inhumane and unconstitutional act, namely an offensive military mobilization in the Middle East.\" She was court-martialed, convicted of desertion, and sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison\n\nAnother soldier, Stephanie Atkinson of Murphysboro, Illinois, refused to report for active duty, saying she thought the U.S. military was in the Persian Gulf solely for economic reasons. She was first placed under house arrest, then given a discharge under \"other than honorable conditions.\"\n\nAn Army physician named Harlow Ballard, stationed at Fort Devens in Massachusetts, refused to follow an order to go to Saudi Arabia. \"I would rather go to jail than support this war,\" he said. \"I don't believe there is any such thing as a just war.\"\n\nOver a thousand reservists declared themselves conscientious objectors. A twenty-three-year-old Marine Corps reservist named Rob Calabro was one of them. \"My father tells me that he's ashamed of me, he screams at me that he's embarrassed by me. But I believe that killing people is morally wrong. I believe I'm serving my country more by being true to my conscience than by living a lie.\"\n\nAn information network sprang up during the Gulf War to tell what was not being told in the major media. There were alternative newspapers in many cities. There were over a hundred community radio stations, able to reach only a fraction of those tuned in to the major networks but the only sources, during the Gulf War, of critical analyses of the war. An ingenious radio person in Boulder, Colorado, named David Barsamian recorded a speech by Noam Chomsky made at Harvard-a devastating critique of the war. He then sent the cassette out to his network of community stations, which were eager for a point of view different from the official one. Two young men in New Jersey then transcribed the talk, put it in pamphlet form, in a shape easily photocopied, and placed the pamphlets in bookstores all over the country\n\nAfter \"victorious\" wars there is almost always a sobering effect, as the war fervor wears off, and citizens assess the costs and wonder what was gained. War fever was at its height in February 1991. In that month, when people being polled were reminded of the huge costs of the war, only 17 percent said the war was not worth it. Four months later, in June, the figure was 30 percent. In the months that followed, Bush's support in the nation dropped steeply, as economic conditions deteriorated. (And in 1992, with the war spirit evaporated, Bush went down to defeat.)\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Soviet bloc began in 1989, there had been talk in the United States of a \"peace dividend,\" the opportunity to take billions of dollars from the military budget and use it for human needs. The war in the Gulf became a convenient excuse for the government determined to stop such talk. A member of the Bush administration said: \"We owe Saddam a favor. He saved us from the peace dividend\" (New York Time, March 2, 1991)\n\nBut the idea of a peace dividend could not be stifled so long as Americans were in need. Shortly after the war, historian Marilyn Young warned:\n\nThe U.S. can destroy Iraq's highways, but not build its own; create the conditions for epidemic in Iraq, but not offer health care to millions of Americans. It can excoriate Iraqi treatment of the Kurdish minority, but not deal with domestic race relations; create homelessness abroad but not solve it here; keep a half million troops drug free as part of a war, but refuse to fund the treatment of millions of drug addicts at home. ... We shall lose the war after we have won it\n\nIn 1992, the limits of military victory became apparent during the quincentennial celebrations of Columbus's arrival in the Western Hemisphere. Five hundred years ago Columbus and his fellow conquerors had wiped out the native population of Hispaniola. This was followed during the next four centuries by the methodical destruction of Indian tribes by the United States government as it marched across the continent. But now, there was a dramatic reaction\n\nThe Indians\u2014the Native Americans\u2014had become a visible force since the sixties and seventies, and in 1992 were joined by other Americans to denounce the quincentennial celebrations. For the first time in all the years that the country had celebrated Columbus Day, there were nationwide protests against honoring a man who had kidnapped, enslaved, mutilated, murdered the natives who greeted his arrival with gifts and friendship\n\nPreparations for the quincentennial began on both sides of the controversy. Official commissions, nationally and in the states, were set up long before the year of the quincentennial\n\nThis spurred action by Native Americans. In the summer of 1990 350 Indians, representatives from all over the hemisphere, met in Quito, Ecuador, at the first intercontinental gathering of indigenous people in the Americas, to mobilize against the glorification of the Columbus conquest\n\nThe following summer, in Davis, California, over a hundred Native Americans gathered for a follow-up meeting to the Quito conference. They declared October 12, 1992, International Day of Solidarity with Indigenous People, and resolved to inform the king of Spain that the replicas of Columbus's three ships, the Nina, Pinta, and Santa Maria, \"will not receive permission from the Native Nations to land in the western hemisphere unless he apologizes for the original incursion 500 years ago. . ..\"\n\nThe movement grew. The largest ecumenical body in the United States, the National Council of Churches, called on Christians to refrain from celebrating the Columbus quincentennial, saying, \"What represented newness of freedom, hope and opportunity for some was the occasion for oppression, degradation and genocide for others.\"\n\nThe National Endowment for the Humanities funded a traveling exhibition called \"First Encounter,\" which romanticized the Columbus conquest. When the exhibition opened at the Florida Museum of National History, Michelle Diamond, a freshman at the University of Florida, climbed aboard a replica of one of Columbus's ships with a sign reading \"Exhibit Teaches Racism.\" She said: \"It's a human issue\u2014not just a Red [Indian] issue.\" She was arrested and charged with trespassing, but demonstrations continued for sixteen days against the exhibit\n\nA newspaper called Indigenous Thought began publication in early 1991 to create a link among all the counter-Columbus quincentenary activities. It carried articles by Native Americans about current struggles over land stolen by treaty\n\nIn Corpus Christi, Texas, Indians and Chicanos joined to protest the city's celebrations of the quincentennial. A woman named Angelina Mendez spoke for the Chicanos: \"The Chicano nation, in solidarity with our Indian brothers and sisters to the north, come together with them on this day to denounce the atrocity the U.S. government proposes in reenacting the arrival of the Spanish, more specifically the arrival of Cristobal Colon, to the shores of this land.\"\n\nThe Columbus controversy brought an extraordinary burst of educational and cultural activity. A professor at the University of California at San Diego, Deborah Small, put together an exhibit of over 200 paintings on wood panels called \"1492.\" She juxtaposed words from Columbus's diary with blown-up fragments from sixteenth-century engravings to dramatize the horrors that accompanied Columbus's arrival in the hemisphere. A reviewer wrote that \"it does remind us, in the most vivid way, of how the coming of Western-style civilization to the New World doesn't provide us with a sunny tale.\"\n\nWhen President Bush attacked Iraq in 1991, claiming that he was acting to end the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, a group of Native Americans in Oregon distributed a biting and ironic \"open letter\":\n\nDear President Bush. Please send your assistance in freeing our small nation from occupation. This foreign force occupied our lands to steal our rich resources. They used biological warfare and deceit, killing thousands of elders, children and women in the process. As they overwhelmed our land, they deposed our leaders and people of our own government, and in its place, they installed their own government systems that yet today control our daily lives in many ways. As in your own words, the occupation and overthrow of one small nation ... is one too many. Sincerely, An American Indian\n\nThe publication Rethinking Schools, which represented socially conscious schoolteachers all over the country, printed a 100-page book called Rethinking Columbus, featuring articles by Native Americans and others, a critical review of children's books on Columbus, a listing of resources for people wanting more information on Columbus, and more reading material on counter- quincentenary activities. In a few months, 200,000 copies of the book were sold\n\nA Portland, Oregon, teacher named Bill Bigelow, who helped put together Rethinking Schools, took a year off from his regular job to tour the country in 1992, giving workshops to other teachers, so that they could begin to tell those truths about the Columbus experience that were omitted from the traditional books and class curricula\n\nOne of Bigelow's own students wrote to the publisher Allyn and Bacon with a critique of their history text The American Spirit:\n\nI'll just pick one topic to keep it simple. How about Columbus. No, you didn't lie, but saying, \"Though they had a keen interest in the peoples of the Caribbean, Columbus and his crews were never able to live peacefully among them,\" makes it seem as if Columbus did no wrong. The reason for not being able to live peacefully is that he and crew took slaves and killed thousands of Indians for not bringing enough gold\n\nAnother student wrote: \"It seemed to me as if the publishers had just printed up some 'glory story' that was supposed to make us feel more patriotic about our country. . .. They want us to look at our country as great and powerful and forever right. . . .\"\n\nA student named Rebecca wrote: \"Of course, the writers of the books probably think it's harmless enough-what does it matter who discovered America, really.... But the thought that I have been lied to all my life about this, and who knows what else, really makes me angry.\"\n\nA group was formed on the West Coast called Italian-Americans Against Christopher Columbus, saying: \"When Italian-Americans identify with Native people ... we are bringing ourselves, each of us, closer to possible change in the world.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles, a high school student named Blake Lindsey went before the city council to argue against celebrating the quincentennial. She spoke to the council about the genocide of the Arawaks, but she got no official response. However, when she told her story on a talk show, a woman phoned in who said she was from Haiti: \"The girl is right. We have no Indians left. At our last uprising in Haiti people destroyed the statue of Columbus. Let's have statues for the aborigines.\"\n\nThere were counter-Columbus activities all over the country, unmentioned in the press or on television. In Minnesota alone, a listing of such activities for 1992 reported dozens of workshops, meetings, films, art shows. At Lincoln Center in New York City, on October 12, there was a performance of Leonard Lehrmann's New World: An Opera About What Columbus Did to the Indians. In Baltimore, there was a multimedia show about Columbus. In Boston and then in a national tour, the Underground Railway Theater performed The Christopher Columbus Follies to packed audiences\n\nThe protests, the dozens of new books that were appearing about Indian history, the discussions taking place all over the country, were bringing about an extraordinary transformation in the educational world. For generations, exactly the same story had been told all American schoolchildren about Columbus, a romantic, admiring story. Now, thousands of teachers around the country were beginning to tell that story differently\n\nThis aroused anger among defenders of the old history, who derided what they called a movement for \"political correctness\" and \"multicultural-ism.\" They resented the critical treatment of Western expansion and imperialism, which they considered an attack on Western civilization. Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Education, William Bennett, had called Western civilization \"our common culture ... its highest ideas and aspirations.\"\n\nA much-publicized book by a philosopher named Allan Bloom, The Closing of the American Mind, expressed horror at what the social movements of the sixties had done to change the educational atmosphere of American universities. To him Western civilization was the high point of human progress, and the United States its best representative: \"America tells one story: the unbroken, ineluctable progress of freedom and equality. From its first settlers and its political foundings on, there has been no dispute that freedom and equality are the essence of justice for us.\"\n\nIn the seventies and eighties, disabled people organized and created a movement powerful enough to bring about the passage by Congress of the Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an unprecedented piece of legislation, setting standards which would enable persons with disabilities to contest discrimination against them, and ensuring they would have access to places where their disabilities would otherwise bar them\n\nIn the civil rights movement, black people disputed that claim of America's standing for \"freedom and equality.\" The women's movement had disputed that claim, too. And now, in 1992, Native Americans were pointing to the crimes of Western civilization against their ancestors. They were recalling the communitarian spirit of the Indians Columbus met and conquered, trying to tell the history of those millions of people who were here before Columbus, giving the lie to what a Harvard historian (Perry Miller) had called \"the movement of European culture into the vacant wilderness of America.\"\n\nAs the United States entered the nineties, the political system, whether Democrats or Republicans were in power, remained in the control of those who had great wealth. The main instruments of information were also dominated by corporate wealth. The country was divided, though no mainstream political leader would speak of it, into classes of extreme wealth and extreme poverty, separated by an insecure and jeopardized middle class\n\nYet, there was, unquestionably, though largely unreported, what a worried mainstream journalist had called \"a permanent adversarial culture\" which refused to surrender the possibility of a more equal, more humane society. If there was hope for the future of America, it lay in the promise of that refusalEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 8, "api_path": "/songs/28980", "artist_names": "LL Cool J (Ft.

motherfucker\n\n[Verse]\nCame out the womb in the month of June, Gemini baby\nMama lost her first son and she thought she was done\nThen three girls later, only God could delay me\nFourth baby wasn't done, on my mama, on my son\nOverprotective 'bout my women by the age of two or three\n\"We gon' make it out the struggle,\" every hood nigga dream\nLearned from my mistakes and now there's shit that I ain't know 'bout\nI'm pushin' her lil' baby, she like, \"Son, you gotta go\"\n'Cari turned four and had the [?] on lockdown\nDad had a [?] with the top down\nHold the rock, done beat the block down, pain in my eyes\nAnd shit got crazy by the time I turned five\nAnd went to elementary school, my mama thought she had the break, she wanted to relax\nStill had to serve the J, after, she'll be back\nTryna figure why we're movin' to a whole 'nother state\nCome to find out we runnin' from the motherfuckin' dispatch\nCome to find out my dad was on the run for a murder\nMama lookin' for love, come to find out every nigga hurt her\n'Til that nigga put his hands on me, pops played a big role\nFuckin' with his son, he on the way and he gon' murder\nSix, seven, eight, back to Atlanta, bitch, I'm hardly ready\nNine, had to go to school, from three, I took the spotter ready\nTen, I was tired of strugglin', eleven, I was goin' steady\nTwelve, I had done jumped off of the porch and I had counted my  blessings\nFourteen, daddy caught another murder charge\nAnd fifteen, startin' flippin', stealin' niggas cards\nAnd I was just grindin', always puttin' in all the work\nGot a call from juvenile, my brother on the turf\nOut there on my own and I was tryna make it work\nBeggin' for a channel, niggas left me in the dirt\nMad at the whole world, so much pain inside\nNobody understood the kid was hurt\nHad to go to school the next day, see the kids flexin' on me\nRoll my eyes, try my best so I can't make her feel wrongly\nBut they came, karma came, I was down by my lonely\nWalked to school with a smile on my face like I wasn't homeless\nSixteen, hit a million\nSeventeen, had dreams, now I want a billion\nEighteen, toxic relationship, nothin' to drain out\nNineteen, made the Forbes list, we not the same now\nTwenty-somethin' years later, I remain the same now\nMama, we made it, oh, ooh, ooh\nI remain the same now, my sisters, we made it, oh, oh, oh\nI remain the same now, I remain the same now, I remain the same\nI remain the same now, I remain the same now, uhYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1433782",

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI ran into a friend of yours the other day\nAnd I asked her how you've been\nShe said 'My girl is fine, just bought a house, got a job, a real good man.'\nI told her I was glad for you, that's wonderful\nBut does she ever ask 'bout me?\n'She says she's happy with her life right now, let her go, let her be.'\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I told myself I would\nBut something in my heart just would not let you go\nI just wanna know...\n[Chorus]\nWhat if we were wrong about each other?\nWhat if you were really made for me?\nWhat if we were supposed to be together?\nWould that not mean anything?\nWhat if that was supposed to be my house that you go home to every day?\nHow can you be sure that things are better\nIf you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me?\nStill wanting me\n\n[Verse 2]\nYour friend asked me if there was someone special\nIn my life that I was seeing\nI told her there was no one in particular\nThere's just I, myself, and me\nI told her that I dream of you quite often\nShe just cut her eyes at me\nShe said, 'You got a home, you're very happy\nSo just stop your meddling'\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI told her that I won't\nI said things are cool, but I guess I was wrong\nI still can't move on\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat if we were wrong about each other?\nWhat if you were really made for me? (Yeah, yeah)\nWhat if we were supposed to be together?\nWould that not mean anything?\nWhat if that was supposed to be my house that you go home to every day?\nHow can you be sure that things are better\nIf you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me?\nStill wanting me\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nNow that could be my car\nThat could be my house\nThat could be my baby boy that you're nursing\nThat could be the trash which I always take out\nThat could be the chair that I love to chill in\nThat could be my food on the table at the end of the day\nHugs and the kisses, all the love we make\nWhat the hell do you expect me to say?\nWhat if it's really supposed to be this way? (Oh)\nWhat if you're really supposed to be with me? (Oh)\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat if we were wrong about each other?\nWhat if you were really made for me?\nWhat if we were supposed to be together? (Oh)\nWould that not mean anything? (Yeah, yeah, baby)\nWhat if that was supposed to be my house that you go home to every day?\nHow can you be sure that things are better\nIf you can't be sure your heart ain't still here with me? (Still with me, baby)\nStill wanting me (Still wanting me, baby)\n\n[Outro]\nWhat if we were wrong about each other?\n(What if we were wrong? What if we were wrong?)\nWhat if you were really made for me? (Oh baby)\nWhat if we were supposed to be together?\nWould that not mean anything?

"Aaron\u2019s Party (Come Get It) Lyrics[Intro]\nHere's a little bit of old school for ya\nThat goes a little something like this...\n\n[Verse 1]\nI always tried to be the flyest kid in the block\nThe popular one with the rising stock\nSo that's when I had this bright idea\n(Throw the party of the month)\nNo, the party of the year\nAll the fine girls couldn't turn it down\nNow all I gotta do is get my parents out\nShould I send them to a movie\n(No, send them to a show)\nLet me think, hmmm\nIt's gotta be long though\nI said Mom, Dad, yo why ya sittin' home\nIt's a Friday night, have you seen Aunt Joan\nAnd don't worry about stayin' out too long\nDon't fuss over me, I'll be fine alone\nHave a good time...\nThe doorbell rings 'cause the party's here\nI'm crankin' up the stereo like it's New Years\nWalkin' 'round the house like who's Da Man\n(Ain't nobody do it like Aaron can)\nFirst on the floor, you know that's me\nBustin' out the moves like it's MTV\nI guess somewhere along I lost my head\nThen I jumped on table, this is what I said\n[Chorus]\nPeople all around you gotta\n(Come get it)\nEveryone together sing it loud\n(Come get it)\nJump all around, come on\n(Come get it)\nWhat...\n(Come get it)\nSay it again\n(Come get it)\nPeople all around you gotta\n(Come get it)\nFrom the left to the right, make noise\n(Come get it)\nHere we go now, come on\n(Come get it)\nUh uh what what\n(Come get it)\n(Come get it)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nNa na na na\nNa na na na\nNa na na na\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nThings are goin' great then to my surprise\nSome people walked in, I didn't recognize\nI said fellas, yo, ya gotta get out\n(Hey man I heard this was an open house)\nOpen house?\n(Yeah that's what the flyers said)\nWell I didn't put out flyers\n(Well somebody did)\nThen walked in\nThe girl I'm crushin'\nAnd the kid spilled juice\nOn my Mom's new cushion\nI turned around and\nAnother kid broke the lamp\n(I hope they weren't expensive)\nThey got them from France\nFor now I won't sweat it\nI'll clean it up later\nThere's a honey over there\nAnd I really wanna meet her\n\n[Chorus]\nPeople all around you gotta\n(Come get it)\nFrom the left to the right, make noise\n(Come get it)\nHere we go now, come on\n(Come get it)\nUh uh what what\n(Come get it)\n(Come get it)\nPeople all around you gotta\n(come get it)\nFrom the left to the right, make

go go go...)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIs that a car door\nOh dang, I'm in trouble\nEverybody get out now\nOn the double\nI'm dead (you're done) that's it for me\nI'm gonna be picked off my family tree\nOnce Mom finds out 'bout this party I had\nI don't even wanna start thinkin' about dad\nI'm hustlin' around the house\nTrying to clean up the mess\nI sure put my new white Nikes to the test\nThe car door slammed\nAnd they're walking up the steps\nI guess life is good with 10 seconds left\n(AARON!!!???!!!)\nGrounded\n\n[Chorus]\nPeople all around you gotta\n(Come get it)\nEveryone together sing it loud\n(Come get it)\nJump all around, come on\n(Come get it)\nWhat...\n(Come get it)\nSay it again\n(Come get it)\nPeople all around you gotta\n(Come get it)\nFrom the left to the right, make

Sycamore Street\nAnd the wheels on the black top\nA starting to whine\nAs I pass that Oklahoma City limit sign\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm a hayseed\nAnd a plow boy\nI'm a farm kid\nAnd a cowboy\nI'm a roughneck\nMy daddy was a roughneck too\n\n[Chorus]\nI run around with hillbilly girls\nThe weekend sits on my hillbilly world\nYou better be ready when the sun goes down\nThat's when country comes to town\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell her Daddy said child you better let him be\nWell I don't like him and he sire don't like me\nMomma just says ya'll have a little fun\nAin't doing nothing me and papa ain't done\nOpen up the door to my pick-up truck\nAnd my baby jumps in and she fires it up\nAnd she gives me a kiss\nAs I crawl in\nWe've been waiting all week for a weekend\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm a

members of the 4H Club\nBoth active in the FFA\nAfter graduation Mary Anne went out\nLookin' for a bright new world\nWanda looked all around this town\nAnd all she found was Earl\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell it wasn't two weeks after she got married\nThat Wanda started gettin' abused\nShe put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses\nAnd makeup to cover a bruise\nWell she finally got the nerve to file for divorce\nShe let the law take it from there\nBut Earl walked right through that restraining order\nAnd put her in intensive care\n[Pre-Chorus]\nRight away, Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta\nOn a red-eye midnight flight\nShe held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan\nAnd it didn't take 'em long to decide\n\n[Chorus]\nThat Earl had to die\nGoodbye, Earl\nThose black-eyed peas\nThey tasted all right to me, Earl\nYou're feeling weak\nWhy don't you lay down and sleep, Earl?\nAin't it dark\nWrapped up in that tarp, Earl?\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe cops came by to bring Earl in\nThey searched the house high and low\nThen they tipped their hats\nAnd said \"Thank You ladies, if you hear from him let us know\"\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell the weeks went by and\nSpring turned to summer\nAnd summer faded into fall\nAnd it turns out he was a missing person\nWho nobody missed at all\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nSo the girls bought some land at a roadside stand\nOut on Highway 109\nThey sell Tennessee ham\nAnd strawberry jam\nAnd they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause...\n\n[Chorus]\nEarl had to die\nGoodbye Earl\nWe need a break\nLet's go out to the lake, Earl\nWe'll pack a lunch\nAnd stuff you in the trunk, Earl\nWell, is that all right?\nGood, let's go for a ride Earl\nHey\n\n[Outro]\nWell hey, hey, hey\nAw, hey, hey, hey\nWell hey, hey, hey2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 8,

felt the first one when he touched my heart\n\nThough I've never seen him fly\nOn the wings of love he carries me\nHeaven bound I'm mystified\nHow with just one kiss he made me\nBelieve in

there's wings tucked up his sleeves\n\nThough I've never seen him fly\nOn the wings of love he carries me\nHeaven bound I'm mystified\nHow with just one kiss he made me\nBelieve in angels\nThough I've

You must be crazy\nYou drippin' with wack juice and you can't get it off\nYou better be prepared to finish what you start, nigga\n\n[Interlude: Mike Tyson]\nYo Canibus, man, you gotta hit harder than that man\nYou don't want no bitch-ass niggas hanging out with me, man\nWe're warriors man, when we go into battle\nWe come out or don't come out at all\n[Verse 2: Canibus]\nYou better give me the respect that I deserve or I'ma take it by force\nBlast you with a .45 Colt, make you somersault\nShock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts\nBefore you wanted a war, now you wanna talk?\nIt's about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first\nThat's why I laugh when I hear that wack-ass verse\nThat shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life\n'Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th\nGod bless his soul; rest in peace, kid\nIt's because of him now at least I know what beef is\nIt's not what I would call this, see this is somethin' different\nA faggot nigga tryna make a livin' off of dissin'\nSomebody that he gotta know is better than him\nBut he feelin' himself 'cause he got more cheddar than him\nWell, let me tell you somethin', you might got more cash than me\nBut you ain't got the skills to eat a nigga's ass like me\nAnd if you really want to show off, we can get it on\nLive in front of the cameras on your own sitcom\nI'll let you kick a verse\u2014fuck it, I'll let you kick 'em all\nI'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud\nNow watch me rip the tat from your arm\nKick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award\nIn front of your mom, your first, second and third born\nMake your wife get on the horn, call Minister Farrakhan\nSo he could persuade me to squash it\nI say \"Naw, he started it, he forgot what a hardcore artist is.\"\nA hardcore artist is a dangerous man\nSuch as myself, trained to run twenty miles in soft sand\nOn or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars offhand\nFrom a lost and forgotten land\nYou done did it, man, you done spitted some wack shit\nAnd probably thought that because it's been a minute I'll forget it?\nFuck that!

projects (Uh-huh)\nChasing after him, a lil' young chick (Yeah)\nSeeing him made me go back in my lab and write this lil' shit like this, check it out (Check it, uh)\n\n[Verse 1: Queen Pen]\nHere's how it goes, used to see you when I went to the store\nAlways watch you play ball from my bedroom window\nAnd the places you frequent, the chicks you freaked with\nThe spot in the grass where you kept your stash\nUsed to wonder to myself if you felt my eyes\nIf you ever noticed me and knew I was alive\nTried to draw your attention, wore dresses to my thighs\nWith hopes to get close to you\nUsed to dream about you right before I went to sleep\nUsed to wake up on the morning hugging the sheets (That's right)\nUsed to practice what I'd say for the day that we'd meet\nUsed to pray every day for the day that we'd meet\nUsed to hang with your sis, if she only knew (That's right)\nI only hung with that bitch to get closer to you (Yeah)\nWasn't no limit to the things I would do\nTo give all my love to you, my God (Yo, E)\n[Pre-Chorus: Eric Williams]\nCan't feel myself\nDon't want nobody else to ever love you (Right)\nYou are my shining star\nMy guiding light, my love fantasy (Yeah, oh yeah)\nThere's not a minute, hour (Check)\nDay or night I don't love you (That's right)\nYou're at the top of my list\n'Cause I'm always thinking of you (Take it to the bridge)\n\n[Chorus: Eric

yourself, now you hung with a crew\nI took the bangs out my hair over the summer, I grew\nMe and my friends, all virgins, all learning\nHow to throw that shit, how to blow that shit\nTalked about that sex like I was used to it\nLied about how many you used to kiss\nIn the hallways, all day, 'til it was real\nIn the staircase, lights out, gettin' our feels (Oh, how it used to be)\nWrote your name in my notebook, we all did that\nLined our names up with numbers to see if they matched (That's right)\nScared to death 'bout the first time, I knew it would hurt\nIn your house, on your mother's couch, she was at work\nDead wrong, but headstrong, ya had me sprung\nThe only one I ever loved ever since I was young\nOnce in a while I even cut school\nTo give all my love to you, my God (Yo, E)\nYou

take the time to care\nWe're the ones\nWe're the losers in this game\nSo where is the tenderness we scarifice for progress\nAnd where is the love we need\nYou know it makes me wonder\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand (reached with just one hand)\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice (sang with just one voice)\nMaybe we could change things\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart (cared with their own heart)\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark (tried to light one spark)\nMaybe we could change things somehow\n\nSomehow it's all up to us\nGotta take this world, make it a world of love\nGotta do it now\nGotta find a way to make a change somehow\nThere's gotta be a way for us to make it better\n\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand (reached with just one hand)\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice (sang with just one voice)\nMaybe we could change things\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart (cared with their own heart)\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark (tried to light one spark)\nMaybe we could change things somehow\n\nHere in our hearts\nOh the answer is there\nIf we only would look inside them\nWe can make it better, we can make it better... If we try together\n\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody reached out with just one hand (reached with just one hand)\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody sang out with just one voice (sang with just one voice)\nMaybe we could change things\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody cared with just one heart (cared with their own heart)\nWhat if everybody, what if everybody tried to light one spark (tried to light one spark)\nMaybe we could change things somehowSee Reba McEntire LiveGet tickets as low as $35You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1705186", "artist_names": "Diana King", "full_title": "L-L-Lies by\u00a0Diana\u00a0King", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://i.genius.com/ec7b71cbfd2f8391f453c8d85f3f472fd591cfde?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.educatepark.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F09%2FR-154766-1308521019.jpeg.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://i.genius.com/ec7b71cbfd2f8391f453c8d85f3f472fd591cfde?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.educatepark.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F09%2FR-154766-1308521019.jpeg.jpg", "id": 1705186, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429904890, "path": "/Diana-king-l-l-lies-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Diana-king-l-l-lies-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1997, "month": 9, "day": 30}, "release_date_for_display": "September 30, 1997", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Sep. 30, 1997", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/3c4898657a36b7b1d6d93fe49fdbb4e8.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3c4898657a36b7b1d6d93fe49fdbb4e8.300x300x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "L-L-Lies", "title_with_featured": "L-L-Lies", "updated_by_human_at": 1503193999, "url": "https://genius.com/Diana-king-l-l-lies-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/368223", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/24a0d9e2f00927dcc5bbf0d07d04f193.1000x662x1.jpg", "id": 368223, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/55914664b7400a0a568c2eb5a765bfc8.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "d", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Diana King", "slug": "Diana-king", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Diana-king"}, "artist": "Diana King", "lyrics": "L-L-Lies LyricsOh why, oh why, oh why\nYou tell me l-l-l-lies\nNever t-t-t-t-t think\nThat I woulda re-a-li-a-li-a-lize\nThings you say-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay\nWill make you fay-ay-ay-ade away\nB-b-b-b-bye-bye-bye\nB-b-b-b-bye-bye-bye-bye (goodbye)\n\n12 o'clock last night in a club\nU an a girl do de rub-a-dub-dub\nShort black dress and long curly hair\nDon't deny it cause I saw u dere\nStep 1 mi did dede when you giv her di line\nStep 2 me did dede when you looked so sincere\nStep 3 mi did dede when you hold her close and\nTell her everything dat she waah fe fear\nWhy you play those games\nThose g-g-g-games with me\nOh, oh, oh, oh no, no, no, no, no, no......\nOh why oh why oh why You tell me\nL-l-l-lies Never t-t-t-t-t-think\nThat I woulda re-a-li-a-li-a-lize\nThings you say-ay-ay-ay-ay\nWill make you fay-ay-ay-ay-ade away\nSo b-b-b-b-bye-bye-bye\nB-b-b-b-bye-bye-bye-bye (goodbye)\n\n12 o'clock in a de afternoon\nU come around wit di same old tune\nGwan on an on like say everything fin\nWhen all di time me know sey a lie, you did a lie\nStep 1 me did dede when u give her de kiss\nStep 2 mi two eyes as me witness\nStep 3 giv mi mi keys and exit please\nYour day is done so u better move on\n\nWhy you play those games\nThose g-g-g-games with me\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, no.

It got me thinkin' like I'm thinkin'\n\"Lord I need help but I can't help myself\"\nAwaken to the sound of sirens, niggas dyin'\nKids in the street wit no food to eat\nProstitutes gettin' money in they only profession\nBut Lord I only got one question\n[Hook] (Bo Rock)\nDo G's go to Heaven? Cause I don't wanna die\n(I know it's wrong and I know what's right)\nBut if so I'd like to know do G's go to heaven?

I hear voices, sayin believe in me\nIs it you? I hear theres a man named god\nThat can fix it, when its twisted\nI'm not sayin I'm all that bad but I can use a lil help\nCause at times I can't help myself\n\n[Hook]\nDo G's go to Heaven?

you go away\n\n[Verse 2]\nAs the sun goes down, and I close my eyes\nAll my dreams they are of you\nThey're filled with emotions and visions that keep me\nKeep me reminded of the life we share\nWhen I'm alone I imagine how it would be\nIf there were never a you to care for me\nNo one else could make me feel this way\nSo I'm never gonna let you go\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't want to be without your love\n'Cause you're the only one I'm thinking of baby\nI'm afraid to live without your love\nSo baby don't you go away\nI don't want to be without your love\n'Cause you're the only one I'm thinking of

"lyrics": "Without Love Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThink of me like I think about you\nGive me a sign, show me you care\nAm I so far away in your thoughts, not there\nForget what you told me, it's what didn't get said\nIt's not much to ask, come down off your cloud\nAnd with your feet on the ground say something out loud\n\n[Chorus]\nWithout love, I mean nothing to you\nWithout love, broken in two\nWithout love, give me some value, some worth\nWithout love, no life left on Earth\n[Verse 2]\nBlame it on work, buy me some flowers\nEmpty gestures wile away the hours (Yeah)\nPromises, promises sealed with a kiss\nPlease acknowledge it's me that you miss (Yeah)\nNo message received, excuses believed, you hurt me so much\nI'll never recover, takes time to discover a love like no other\n\n[Chorus]\nWithout love, I mean nothing to you\nWithout love, broken in two\nWithout love, give me some value, some worth\nWithout love, no life left on Earth\n\n[Outro]\nWithout love, I mean nothing to you\nWithout love\nWithout love, I mean nothing to you\nWithout love\nI mean nothing, I mean nothing, I mean nothing, nothing to you\nAnd I'm broken, and I'm broken, broken in two\nI mean nothing\nYeahYou might

at the East river, waiting to meet with you\nLate at night, I keep dreaming of you\nWe're making love, on the sofa, that belongs to you\n\nWe fly higher than kites, when we're face to face\nSearching for time, alone, in this here violent place\nWe don't know who we are, or why we've met\nThat is strangely good, in some sort of freakish way\n\nThe things we'll do, will make you feel like a woman\nFalling in love, with a man she doesn't even know\nThe words we'll say, will send your mind on a journey\nLooking for self-understanding, of the things we've done\nCatch your breath; your heart beats too fast\nYou feel my presence, in your arms, will not last\nI have an urge; I must kiss your hand\nThe first scent of this woman's fragrance, lies deep in my head\n\nSo we slit our wrists, and we join our blood\nTo symbolise, some type of, crazy oath\nSometimes it feels so wrong, but it could be good enough\nTo sacrifice our freedom for each other's hearts\n\nThe things we'll do, will make you feel like a woman\nFalling in love, with a man she doesn't even know\nThe words we'll say, will send your mind on a journey\nLooking for self-understanding, of the things we've done\n\nThe things

know\n(Somethin' for the honeys) You better ask somebody\n(Somethin' for the honeys)\nBaby, this is for you, and you, and definitely you\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm the type of guy who takes time to just kick back\nI turn around my baseball cap\nI have a 40 sittin' on my lap\nSlamming the ivories until I sees\nA female worth my while\nI'm scoping that ass, checking her smile\nAnd I know that I can get it\nAnd I'll hit it if she's wit' it\nI get the five to the six, seven digits\nCall her up on my cellular\nAnd all the shit that I'll say to her\nThe fun will begin when I hit the skizins (Yeah)\nSo if a girlie is lonesome\nI think that she knows where to go when she wants some\n'Cause Monty ain't here for nothing, but I got a little\n[Chorus]\nSomethin' for the honeys\n(Yeah, from the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)\nSomethin' for the honeys\n(You know, the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)\nSomethin' for the honeys, yeah, yeah, yeah\n(Uh-huh, from the sick, sick brothas in the big black cars)\nSomethin' for the honeys\n\n[Verse 2]\nOoh, summertime, no funner time for me to kick in with you\nTo find something or someone to get into\nI call up my crew, I tell them to bring a brew\nAnd some Hennessy for the beach party\nSo call up your girlfriends\nAnd you know there always tends to be an ugly one\nBut bring her, too\nFat or skinny, she likes to shoop (Shoop, shoop)\nWith Montell and the SL Coupe\nWhile the beat is bumpin'\nFrom South Central to Compton, a little somethin' somethin'\nCould very well be the next Aaron Neville\nSounding like nobody 'cause I'm on another level\nAnd you fellas can't dig it with a shovel\nBut it ain't for you\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSomethin' for the honeys\n(Yeah, from the sick, sick brothas in the big black

"TranslationsPortugu\u00easSo Many Tears Lyrics[Intro: 2Pac]\nI shall not fear no man but God\nThough I walk through the valley of death\nI shed so many tears\nIf I should die before I wake\nPlease God walk with me\nGrab a nigga and take me to Heaven\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nBack in elementary, I thrived on misery\nLeft me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed\nInside my mind couldn't find a place to rest\nUntil I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest\nTell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past\nYou wanna last? Be the first to blast\nRemember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased\nCall on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets\nNow he rest in peace\nIs there a heaven for a G? Remember me\nSo many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears\n[Chorus: 2Pac, 2Pac & Shock G]\nAhh, I suffered through the years\nAnd shed so many tears\nLord, I lost so many peers\nAnd shed so many tears\n\n[Verse 2: 2Pac]\nNow that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means\nLabel me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen\nAnd fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed\nI'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse\nGod, can you feel me?\nTake me away from all the pressure and all the pain\nShow me some happiness again\nI'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well\nI know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?\nMy life is in denial and when I die\nBaptized in eternal fire, I'll shed so many tears\n[Refrain: 2Pac, 2Pac & Shock G]\nLord, I suffered through the years\nAnd shed so many tears\nLord, I lost so many peers\nAnd shed so many tears\n\n[Verse 3: 2Pac]\nNow I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears\nI'm suicidal, so don't stand near me\nMy every move is a calculated step\nTo bring me closer to embrace an early death\nNow there's nothin' left\nThere was no mercy on the streets\nI couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'\nAbout to go to pieces, screamin' peace\nAnd though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it\nI had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free\nThey planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame\nInside my brain like a match, such a dirty game\nNo memories, just a misery\nPaintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep\nWill I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?\nPlease Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come\nYou might also like[Refrain: 2Pac, 2Pac & Shock G]\nLord! (God!)\nI suffered through the years\nAnd shed so many tears\nGod, I lost so many peers\n\n[Verse 4: 2Pac]\nAnd Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide\nSeen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die\nWonder why as I walk by\nBroken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high\nThis ain't the life for me, I wanna change\nBut ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game\nI'm trapped inside a maze\nSee this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy\nDisillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies\nSo I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady\nDon't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison\nI'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys\nCan't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor\nBeggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door\nShed so many tears (God please help me)\n\n[Refrain: 2Pac, Shock G, 2Pac & Shock G]\nLord, I lost so many years (I suffered through the years)\nAnd shed so many tears\nI lost so many peers\nAnd shed so many tears\nLord, I suffered through the years\nAnd shed so many tears\nGod, I lost so many peers\nAnd shed so many tears80Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path":

The boarder incident prerepeated itself. The pair (whethertheywere Nippoluono engaging Wei\u2013Ling-Taou or de Razzkias trying to reconnoistre the general Boukeleff, man may not say), struggled apairently for some considerable time, (the cradle rocking equally to one and oppositely from the other on its law of capture and recapture), under the All In rules around the booksafe, fighting like purple top and tipperuhry Swede, (Secremented Servious of the Divine Zeal!) and in the course of their tussle the toller man, who had opened his bully bowl to beg, said to the miner who was carrying the worm (a handy term for the portable distillery which consisted of three vats, two jars and several bottles though we purposely say nothing of the stiff, both parties having an interest in the spirits): Let me go, Pautheen! I hardly knew ye. Later on, after the solstitial pause for refleshmeant, the same man (or a different and younger him of the same ham) asked in the vermicular with a very oggly chew-chin-grin: Was six victolios fifteen pigeon takee offa you, tell he me, stlongfella, by pickypocky ten to foul months behindaside? There were some further collidabanter and severe tries to convert for the best part of an hour and now a woden affair in the shape of a webley (we at once recognise our old friend Ned of so many illortemporate letters) fell from the intruser who, as stuck as that cat to that mouse in that tube of that christchurch organ, (did the imnage of Girl Cloud Pensive flout above them light young charm, in ribbons and pigtail?) whereupon became friendly and, saying not his shirt to tear, to know wanted, joking and knobkerries, all aside laying, if his change companion who stuck still to the in vention of his strongbox, with a tenacity corrobberating their mutual tenitorial rights, happened to have the loots change of a tenpound crickler about him at the moment, addling that hap so, he would pay him back the six vics odd, do you see, out of that for what was taken on the man of samples last Yuni or Yuly, do you follow me, Capn? To this the other, Billi with the Boule, who had mummed and mauled up to that (for he was hesitency carried to excelcism) rather amusedly replied: Woowoo would you be grossly surprised, Hill, to learn that, as it so happens, I honestly have not such a thing as the loo, as the least chance of a tinpanned crackler anywhere about me at the present mohomoment but I believe I can see my way, as you suggest, it being Yuletide or Yuddanfest and as it\u2019s mad nuts, son, for you when it\u2019s hatter\u2019s hares, mon, for me, to advance you something like four and sevenpence between hopping ar_d trapping which you might just as well have, boy baches, to buy J.

Herwho?\n\nNowthen, leaving clashing ash, brawn and muscle and brassmade to oust earthernborn and rockcrystal to wreck isinglass but wurming along gradually for our savings backtowards motherwaters so many miles from bank and Dublin stone (olympiading even till the eleventh dynasty to reach that thuddysickend Hamlaugh) and to the question of boney\u2019s unlawfully obtaining a pierced paraflamme and claptrap fireguard there crops out the still more salient point of the politish leanings and town pursuits of our forebeer, El Don De Dunelli, (may his ship thicked stick in the bottol of the river and all his crewsers stock locked in the burral of the seas!) who, when within the black of your toenail, sir, of being mistakenly ambushed by one of the uddahveddahs, and as close as made no matter, mam, to being kayoed offhand when the hyougono heckler with the Peter the Painter wanted to hole him, was consistently practising the first of the primary and imprescriptible liberties of the pacific subject by circulating (be British, boys to your bellybone and chuck a chum a chance!) alongst one of our umphrohibited semitary thrufahrts, open to buggy and bike, to walk, Wellington Park road, with the curb or quaker\u2019s quacknostrum under his auxter and his alpenstuck in his redhand, a highly commendable exercise, or, number two of our acta legitima plebeia, on the brink (beware to baulk a man at his will!) of taking place upon a public seat, to what, bare by Butt\u2019s, most easterly (but all goes west!) of blackpool bridges, as a public protest and naturlikevice, without intent to annoy either, being praisegood thankfully for the wrathbereaved ringdove and the fearstung boaconstrictor and all the more right jollywell pleased, which he was, at having other people\u2019s weather.\n\nBut to return to the atlantic and Phenitia Proper. As if that were not to be enough for anyone but little headway, if any, was made in solving the wasnottobe crime cunundrum when a child of Maam, Festy King, of a family long and honourably associated with the tar and feather industries, who gave an address in old plomansch Mayo of the Saxons in the heart of a foulfamed potheen district, was subsequently haled up at the Old Bailey on the calends of Mars, under an incompatibly framed indictment of both the counts (from each equinoxious points of view, the one fellow\u2019s fetch being the other follow\u2019s person) that is to see, flying cushats out of his ouveralls and making fesses immodst his forces on the field. Oyeh! Oyeh! When the prisoner, soaked in methylated, appeared in dry dock, appatently ambrosiaurealised, like Kersse\u2019s Korduroy Karikature, wearing, besides stains, rents and patches, his fight shirt, straw braces, souwester and a policeman\u2019s corkscrew trowswers, all out of the true (as he had purposely torn up all his cymtrymanx bespokes in the mamertime), deposing for his exution with all the fluors of sparse in the royal Irish vocabulary how the whole padderjagmartin tripiezite suet and all the sulfeit of copperas had fallen off him quatz unaccountably like the chrystalisations of Alum on Even while he was trying for to stick fire to himcell, (in feacht he was dripping as he found upon stripping for a pipkin ofmalt as he feared the coold raine) it was attempted by the crown (P.C. Robort) to show that King, elois Crowbar, once known as Meleky, impersonating a climbing boy, rubbed some pixes of any luvial peatsmoor o\u2019er his face, plucks and pussas, with a clanetourf as the best means of disguising himself and was to the middlewhite fair in Mudford of a Thoorsday, feishts of Peeler and Pole, under the illassumed names of Tykingfest and Rabworc picked by him and Anthony out of a tellafun book, ellegedly with a pedigree pig (unlicensed) and a hyacinth. They were on that sea by the plain of Ir nine hundred and ninetynine years and they never cried crack or ceased from regular paddlewicking till that they landed their two and a trifling selves, amadst camel and ass, greybeard and suckling, priest and pauper, matrmatron and merrymeg, into the meddle of the mudstorm. The gathering, convened by the Irish Angricultural and Prepostoral Ouraganisations, to help the Irish muck to look his brother dane in the face and attended thanks to Larry by large numbers, of christies and jew\u2019s totems, tospite of the deluge, was distinctly of a scattery kind when the ballybricken he could get no good of, after cockofthewalking through a few fancyfought mains ate some of the doorweg, the pikey later selling the gentleman ratepayer because she, Francie\u2019s sister, that is to say, ate a whole side of his (the animal\u2019s) sty, on a struggle Street, Qui Sta Troia, in order to pay off, hiss or lick, six doubloons fifteen arrears of his, the villain\u2019s not the rumbler\u2019s rent.\n\nRemarkable evidence was given, anon, by an eye, ear, nose and throat witness, whom Wesleyan chapelgoers suspected of being a plain clothes priest W.P., situate at Nullnull, Medical Square, who, upon letting down his rice and peacegreen coverdisk and having been sullenly cautioned against yawning while being grilled, smiled (he had had a onebumper at parting from Mrs Molroe in the morning) and stated to his eliciter under his morse mustaccents (gobbless!) that he slept with a bonafides and that he would be there to remember the filth of November, hatinaring, rowdy O, which, with the jiboulees of Juno and the dates of ould lanxiety, was going, please the Rainmaker, to decembs within the ephemerides of profane history, all one with Tournay, Yetstoslay and Temorah, and one thing which would pigstickularly strike a person of such sorely tried observational powers as Sam, him and Moffat, though theirs not to reason why, the striking thing about it was that he was patrified to see, hear, taste and smell, as his time of night, how Hyacinth O\u2019Donnell, B.A., described in the calendar as a mixer and wordpainter, with part of a sivispacem (Gaeltact for dungfork) on the fair green at the hour of twentyfour o\u2019clock sought (the bullycassidy of the friedhoffer!) to sack, sock, stab and slaughter singlehanded another two of the old kings, Gush Mac Gale and Roaring O\u2019Crian, Jr., both changelings, unlucalised, of no address and in noncommunicables, between him and whom, ever since wallops before the Mise of Lewes, bad blood existed on the ground of the boer\u2019s trespass on the bull or because he firstparted his polarbeeber hair in twoways, or because they were creepfoxed andt grousuppers over a nippy in a noveletta, or because they could not say meace, (mute and daft) meathe. The litigants, he said, local congsmen and donalds, kings of the arans and the dalkeys, kings of mud and tory, even the goat king of Killorglin, were egged on by their supporters in the shape of betterwomen with bowstrung hair of Carrothagenuine ruddiness, waving crimson petties and screaming from Isod\u2019s towertop. There were cries from the thicksets in court and from the macdublins on the bohernabreen of: Mind the bank from Banagher, Mick, sir! Prodooce O\u2019Donner. Ay! Exhibit his relics! Bu! Use the tongue mor! Give lip less! But it oozed out in Deadman\u2019s Dark Scenery Court through crossexanimation of the casehardened testis that when and where that knife of knifes the treepartied ambush was laid (roughly spouting around half hours \u2018twixt dusk in dawn, by Waterhose\u2019s Meddle Europeic Time, near Stop and Think, high chief evervirens and only abfalltree in auld the land) there was not as much light from the widowed moon as would dim a child\u2019s altar. The mixer, accordingly, was bluntly broached, and in the best basel to boot, as to whether he was one of those lucky cocks for whom the audible-visible-gnosible-edible world existed. That he was only too cognitively conatively cogitabundantly sure of it because, living, loving, breathing and sleeping morphomelosophopancreates, as he most significantly did, whenever he thought he heard he saw he felt he made a bell clipperclipperclipperclipper.

It was Morbus O\u2019 Somebody? A\u2019Quite. Szerday\u2019s Son? A satyr in weddens. And how did the greeneyed mister arrive at the B.A.? That it was like his poll.

A loss of Lordedward and a lack of sir-philip a surgeonet showeradown could suck more gargling bubbles out of the five lamps in Portterand\u2019s praise. Wirrgeling and maries? As whose wouldn\u2019t, laving his leaftime in Blackpool. But, of course, he could call himself Tem, too, if he had time to? You butt he could anytom. When he pleased? Win and place. A stoker temptated by evesdripping aginst the driver who was a witness as well? Sacred avatar, how the devil did they guess it! Two dreamyums in one dromium? Yes and no error. And both as like as a duel of lentils? Peacisely. So he was pelted out of the coram populo, was he? Be the powers that be he was. The prince in principel should not expose his person? Macchevuole!

Lindendelly, coke or skilllies spell me gart without a gate? Harlyadrope. The grazing rights (Mrs Magistra Martinetta) expired with the expiry of the goat\u2019s sire, if they were not mistaken?

The litter! And the soother the bitther! Of eyebrow pencilled, by lipstipple penned. Borrowing a word and begging the question and stealing tinder and slipping like soap.

The solid man saved by his sillied woman. Crackajolking away like a hearse on fire. The elm that whimpers at the top told the stone that moans when stricken. Wind broke it. Wave bore it. Reed wrote of it. Syce ran with it. Hand tore it and wild went war. Hen trieved it and plight pledged peace. It was folded with cunning, sealed with crime, uptied by a harlot, undone by a child. It was life but was it fair? It was free but was it art? The old hunks on the hill read it to perlection. It made ma make merry and sissy so shy and rubbed some shine off Shem and put some shame into Shaun.

Well and druly dry. Suffering law the dring. Accourting to king\u2019s evelyns. So help her goat and kiss the bouc. Festives and highajinks and jintyaun and her beetyrossy bettydoaty and not to forget now a\u2019duna o\u2019darnel. The four of them and thank court now there were no more of them. So pass the push for port sake. Be it soon. Ah ho! And do you remember, Singabob, the badfather, the same, the great Howdoyoucallem, and his old nickname, Dirty Daddy Pantaloons, in his monopoleums, behind the war of the two roses, with Michael Victory, the sheemen\u2019s preester, before he caught his paper dispillsation from the poke, old Minace and Minster York? Do I mind? I mind the gush off the mon like Ballybock manure works on a tradewinds day. And the O\u2019Moyly gracies and the O\u2019Briny rossies chaffing him bluchface and playing him pranks. How do you do, todo, North Mister? Get into my way! Ah dearome forsailoshe! Gone over the bays! When ginabawdy meadabawdy! Yerra, why would he heed that old gasometer with his hooping coppin and his dyinboosycough and all the birds of the southside after her, Minxy Cunningham, their dear divorcee darling, jimmies and jonnies to be her jo? Hold hard. There\u2019s three other corners to our isle\u2019s cork float. Sure, \u2019tis well I can telesmell him H2 C E3 that would take a township\u2019s breath away! Gob and I nose him too well as I do meself, heaving up the Kay Wall by the 32 to II with his limelooking horsebags full of sesameseed, the Whiteside Kaffir, and his sayman\u2019s effluvium and his scentpainted voice, puffing out his thundering big brown cabbage! Pa! Thawt I\u2019m glad a gull for his pawsdeen fiunn! Goborro, sez he, Lankyshied! Gobugga ye, sez I! O breezes! I sniffed that lad long before anyone. It was when I was in my farfather out at the west and she and myself, the redheaded girl, firstnighting down Sycomore Lane. Fine feelplay we had of it mid the kissabetts frisking in the kool kurkle dusk of the lushiness. My perfume of the pampas, says she (meaning me) putting out her netherlights, and I\u2019d sooner one precious sip at your pure mountain dew than enrich my acquaintance with that big brewer\u2019s belch.\n\nAnd so they went on, the fourbottle men, the analists, unguam and nunguam and lunguam again, their anschluss about her whosebefore and his whereafters and how she was lost away away in the fern and how he was founded deap on deep in anear, and the rustlings and the twitterings and the raspings and the snappings and the sighings and the paintings and the ukukuings and the (hist!) the springapartings and the (hast!) the bybyscuttlings and all the scandalmunkers and the pure craigs that used to be (up) that time living and lying and rating and riding round Nunsbelly Square. And all the buds in the bush. And the laughing jackass. Harik! Harik! Harik! The rose is white in the darik! And Sunfella\u2019s nose has got rhinoceritis from haunting the roes in the parik! So all rogues lean to rhyme. And contradrinking themselves about Lillytrilly law pon hilly and Mrs Niall of the Nine Corsages and the old markiss their besterfar, and, arrah, sure there was never a marcus at all at all among the manlies and dear Sir Armoury, queer Sir Rumoury, and the old house by the churpelizod, and all the goings on so very wrong long before when they were going on retreat, in the old gammeldags, the four of them, in Milton\u2019s Park under lovely Father Whisperer and making her love with his stuffstuff in the languish of flowers and feeling to find was she mushymushy, and wasn\u2019t that vely both of them, the saucicissters, a drahereen o machree !, and (peep!) meeting waters most improper (peepette!) ballround the garden, trickle trickle trickle triss, please, miman, may I go flirting? farmers gone with a groom and how they used her, mused her, licksed her and cuddled. I differ with ye! Are you sure of yourself now? You\u2019re a liar, excuse me! I will not and you\u2019re another! And Lully holding their breach of the peace for them. Pool loll Lolly! To give and to take! And to forego the pasht! And all will be forgotten! Ah ho! It was too too bad to be falling out about her kindness pet and the shape of O O O O O O O O Ourang\u2019s time. Well, all right, Lelly. And shakeahand. And schenkusmore. For Craig sake. Be it suck.\n\nWell?\n\nWell, even should not the framing up of such figments in the evidential order bring the true truth to light as fortuitously as a dim seer\u2019s setting of a starchart might (heaven helping it!) uncover the nakedness of an unknown body in the fields of blue or as forehearingly as the sibspeeches of all mankind have foliated (earth seizing them!) from the root of some funner\u2019s stotter all the soundest sense to be found immense our special mentalists now holds (securus iudicat orbis terrarum) that by such playing possum our hagious curious encestor bestly saved his brush with his posterity, you, charming coparcenors, us, heirs of his tailsie. Gundogs of all breeds were beagling with renounced urbiandor- bic bugles, hot to run him, given law, on a scent breasthigh, keen for the worry. View! From his holt outratted across the Juletide\u2019s genial corsslands of Humfries Chase from Mullinahob and Peacockstown, then bearing right upon Tankardstown, the outlier, a white noelan which Mr L\u00fewensteil Fitz Urse\u2019s basset beaters had first misbadgered for a bruin of some swart, led bayers the run, then through Raystown and Horlockstown and, louping the loup, to Tankardstown again. Ear canny hare for doubling through Cheeverstown they raced him, through Loughlinstown and Nutstown to wind him by the Boolies. But from the good turn when he last was lost, check, upon Ye Hill of Rut in full winter coat with ticker pads, pointing for his rooming house his old nordest in his rolltoproyal hessians a deaf fuchser\u2019s volponism hid him close in covert, miraculously ravenfed and buoyed up, in rumer, reticule, onasum and abomasum, upon (may Allbrewham have his mead!) the creamclotted sherriness of cinnamon syllabub, Mikkelraved, Nikkelsaved. Hence hounds hied home. Preservative perseverance in the reeducation of his intestines was the rebuttal by whilk he sort of git the big bulge on the whole bunch of spasoakers, dieting against glues and gravies, in that sometime prestreet protown. Vainly violence, virulence and vituperation sought wellnigh utterly to attax and abridge, to derail and depontify, to enrate and inroad, to ongoad and unhume the great shipping mogul and underlinen overlord.\n\nBut the spoil of hesitants, the spell of hesitency. His atake is it ashe, tittery taw tatterytail, hasitense humponadimply, heyheyheyhey a winceywencky.\n\nAssembly men murmured. Reynard is slow!\n\nOne feared for his days. Did there yawn? \u2019Twas his stommick. Eruct? The libber. A gush? From his visuals. Pung? Delivver him, orelode! He had laid violent hands on himself, it was brought in Fugger\u2019s Newsletter, lain down, all in, fagged out, with equally melancholy death. For the triduum of Saturnalia his goatservant had paraded hiz willingsons in the Forum while the jenny infanted the lass to be greeted raucously (the Yardstated) with houx and epheus and measured with missiles too from a hundred of manhood and a wimmering of weibes. Big went the bang: then wildewide was quiet: a report: silence: last Fama put it under ether. The noase or the loal had dreven him blem, blem, stun blem. Sparks flew. He had fled again (open shunshema!) this country of exile, sloughed off, sidleshomed via the subterranean shored with bedboards, stowed away and ankered in a dutch bottom tank, the Arsa, hod S.S. Finlandia, and was even now occupying, under an islamitic newhame in his seventh generation, a physical body Cornelius Magrath\u2019s (badoldkarakter, commonorrong canbung) in Asia Major, where as Turk of the theater (first house all flatty: the king, eleven sharps) he had bepiastered the buikdanseuses from the opulence of his omnibox while as arab at the streetdoor he bepestered the bumbashaws for the alms of a para\u2019s pence. Wires hummed. Peacefully general astonishment assisted by regrettitude had put a term till his existence: he saw the family saggarth, resigned, put off his remainders, was recalled and scrapheaped by the Maker. Chirpings crossed. An infamous private ailment (vulgovarioveneral) had claimed endright, closed his vicious circle, snap. Jams jarred. He had walked towards the middle of an ornamental lilypond when innebriated up to the point where braced shirts meet knickerbockers, as wangfish daring the buoyant waters, when rodmen\u2019s firstaiding hands had rescued un from very possibly several feel of demifrish water. Mush spread. On Umbrella Street where he did drinks from a pumps a kind workman, Mr Whitlock, gave him a piece of wood.

Lawrence", "lyrics": "The White Peacock (Chap. 1.6) LyricsThe Education Of George\n\nAs I have said, Strelley Mill lies at the north end of the long Nethermere valley. On the northern slopes lay its pasture and arable lands. The shaggy common, now closed and part of the estate, covered the western slope, and the cultivated land was bounded on the east by the sharp dip of the brook course, a thread of woodland broadening into a spinney and ending at the upper pond; beyond this, on the east, rose the sharp, wild, grassy hillside, scattered with old trees, ruinous with the gaunt, ragged bones of old hedge-rows, grown into thorn trees. Along the rim of the hills, beginning in the northwest, were dark woodlands, which swept round east and south till they raced down in riot to the very edge of southern Nethermere, surrounding our house. From the eastern hill crest, looking straight across, you could see the spire of Selsby Church, and a few roofs, and the head-stocks of the pit.\n\nSo on three sides the farm was skirted by woods, the dens of rabbits, and the common held another warren.\n\nNow the squire of the estate, head of an ancient, once even famous, but now decayed house, loved his rabbits. Unlike the family fortunes, the family tree flourished amazingly; Sherwood could show nothing comparable. Its ramifications were stupendous; it was more like a banyan than a British oak. How was the good squire to nourish himself and his lady, his name, his tradition, and his thirteen lusty branches on his meagre estates? An evil fortune discovered to him that he could sell each of his rabbits, those bits of furry vermin, for a shilling or thereabouts in Nottingham; since which time the noble family subsisted by rabbits.\n\nFarms were gnawed away; corn and sweet grass departed from the face of the hills; cattle grew lean, unable to eat the defiled herbage. Then the farm became the home of a keeper, and the country was silent, with no sound of cattle, no clink of horses, no barking of lusty dogs.\n\nBut the squire loved his rabbits. He defended them against the snares of the despairing farmer, protected them with gun and notices to quit. How he glowed with thankfulness as he saw the dishevelled hillside heave when the gnawing hosts moved on!\n\"Are they not quails and manna?\" said he to his sporting guest, early one Monday morning, as the high meadow broke into life at the sound of his gun. \"Quails and manna\u2014in this wilderness?\"\n\n\"They are, by Jove!\" assented the sporting guest as he took another gun, while the saturnine keeper smiled grimly.\n\nMeanwhile, Strelley Mill began to suffer under this gangrene. It was the outpost in the wilderness. It was an understood thing that none of the squire's tenants had a gun.\n\n\"Well,\" said the squire to Mr. Saxton, \"you have the land for next to nothing\u2014next to nothing\u2014at a rent really absurd. Surely the little that the rabbits eat\u2014\u2014\"\n\n\"It's not a little\u2014come and look for yourself,\" replied the farmer. The squire made a gesture of impatience.\n\n\"What do you want?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Will you wire me off?\" was the repeated request.\n\n\"Wire is\u2014what does Halkett say\u2014so much per yard\u2014and it would come to\u2014what did Halkett tell me now?\u2014but a large sum. No, I can't do it.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't live like this.\"\n\n\"Have another glass of whisky? Yes, yes, I want another glass myself, and I can't drink alone\u2014so if I am to enjoy my glass.\u2014That's it! Now surely you exaggerate a little. It's not so bad.\"\n\n\"I can't go on like it, I'm sure.\"\n\n\"Well, we'll see about compensation\u2014we'll see. I'll have a talk with Halkett, and I'll come down and have a look at you. We all find a pinch somewhere\u2014it's nothing but humanity's heritage.\"\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI was born in September, and love it best of all the months. There is no heat, no hurry, no thirst and weariness in corn harvest as there is in the hay. If the season is late, as is usual with us, then mid-September sees the corn still standing in stook. The mornings come slowly. The earth is like a woman married and fading; she does not leap up with a laugh for the first fresh kiss of dawn, but slowly, quietly, unexpectantly lies watching the waking of each new day. The blue mist, like memory in the eyes of a neglected wife, never goes from the wooded hill, and only at noon creeps from the near hedges. There is no bird to put a song in the throat of morning; only the crow's voice speaks during the day. Perhaps there is the regular breathing hush of the scythe\u2014even the fretful jar of the mowing machine. But next day, in the morning, all is still again. The lying corn is wet, and when you have bound it, and lift the heavy sheaf to make the stook, the tresses of oats wreathe round each other and droop mournfully.\n\nAs I worked with my friend through the still mornings we talked endlessly. I would give him the gist of what I knew of chemistry, and botany, and psychology. Day after day I told him what the professors had told me; of life, of sex and its origins; of Schopenhauer and William James. We had been friends for years, and he was accustomed to my talk. But this autumn fruited the first crop of intimacy between us. I talked a great deal of poetry to him, and of rudimentary metaphysics. He was very good stuff. He had hardly a single dogma, save that of pleasing himself. Religion was nothing to him. So he heard all I had to say with an open mind, and understood the drift of things very rapidly, and quickly made these ideas part of himself.\n\nWe tramped down to dinner with only the clinging warmth of the sunshine for a coat. In this still, enfolding weather a quiet companionship is very grateful. Autumn creeps through everything. The little damsons in the pudding taste of September, and are fragrant with memory. The voices of those at table are softer and more reminiscent than at haytime.\n\nAfternoon is all warm and golden. Oat sheaves are lighter; they whisper to each other as they freely embrace. The long, stout stubble tinkles as the foot brushes over it; the scent of the straw is sweet. When the poor, bleached sheaves are lifted out of the hedge, a spray of nodding wild raspberries is disclosed, with belated berries ready to drop; among the damp grass lush blackberries may be discovered. Then one notices that the last bell hangs from the ragged spire of fox-glove. The talk is of people, an odd book; of one's hopes\u2014and the future; of Canada, where work is strenuous, but not life; where the plains are wide, and one is not lapped in a soft valley, like an apple that falls in a secluded orchard. The mist steals over the face of the warm afternoon. The tying-up is all finished, and it only remains to rear up the fallen bundles into shocks. The sun sinks into a golden glow in the west. The gold turns to red, the red darkens, like a fire burning low, the sun disappears behind the bank of milky mist, purple like the pale bloom on blue plums, and we put on our coats and go home.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIn the evening, when the milking was finished, and all the things fed, then we went out to look at the snares. We wandered on across the stream and up the wild hillside. Our feet rattled through black patches of devil's-bit scabius; we skirted a swim of thistle-down, which glistened when the moon touched it. We stumbled on through wet, coarse grass, over soft mole-hills and black rabbit-holes. The hills and woods cast shadows; the pools of mist in the valleys gathered the moonbeams in cold, shivery light.\n\nWe came to an old farm that stood on the level brow of the hill. The woods swept away from it, leaving a great clearing of what was once cultivated land. The handsome chimneys of the house, silhouetted against a light sky, drew my admiration. I noticed that there was no light or glow in any window, though the house had only the width of one room, and though the night was only at eight o'clock. We looked at the long, impressive front. Several of the windows had been bricked in, giving a pitiful impression of blindness; the places where the plaster had fallen off the walls showed blacker in the shadow. We pushed open the gate, and as we walked down the path, weeds and dead plants brushed our ankles. We looked in at a window. The room was lighted also by a window from the other side, through which the moonlight streamed on to the flagged floor, dirty, littered with paper, and wisps of straw. The hearth lay in the light, with all its distress of grey ashes, and piled cinders of burnt paper, and a child's headless doll, charred and pitiful. On the border-line of shadow lay a round fur cap\u2014a game-keeper's cap. I blamed the moonlight for entering the desolate room; the darkness alone was decent and reticent. I hated the little roses on the illuminated piece of wallpaper, I hated that fireside.\n\nWith farmer's instinct George turned to the outhouse. The cow-yard startled me. It was a forest of the tallest nettles I have ever seen\u2014nettles far taller than my six feet. The air was soddened with the dank scent of nettles. As I followed George along the obscure brick path, I felt my flesh creep. But the buildings, when we entered them, were in splendid condition; they had been restored within a small number of years; they were well-timbered, neat, and cosy. Here and there we saw feathers, bits of animal wreckage, even the remnants of a cat, which we hastily examined by the light of a match. As we entered the stable there was an ugly noise, and three great rats half rushed at us and threatened us with their vicious teeth. I shuddered, and hurried back, stumbling over a bucket, rotten with rust, and so filled with weeds that I thought it part of the jungle. There was a silence made horrible by the faint noises that rats and flying bats give out. The place was bare of any vestige of corn or straw or hay, only choked with a growth of abnormal weeds. When I found myself free in the orchard I could not stop shivering. There were no apples to be seen overhead between us and the clear sky. Either the birds had caused them to fall, when the rabbits had devoured them, or someone had gathered the crop.\n\n\n\"This,\" said George bitterly, \"is what the mill will come to.\"\n\n\"After your time,\" I said.\n\n\"My time\u2014my time. I shall never have a time. And I shouldn't be surprised if father's time isn't short\u2014with rabbits and one thing and another. As it is, we depend on the milk-round, and on the carting which I do for the council. You can't call it farming. We're a miserable mixture of farmer, milkman, greengrocer, and carting contractor. It's a shabby business.\"\n\n\"You have to live,\" I retorted.\n\n\"Yes\u2014but it's rotten. And father won't move\u2014and he won't change his methods.\"\n\"Well\u2014what about you?\"\n\n\"Me! What should I change for?\u2014I'm comfortable at home. As for my future, it can look after itself, so long as nobody depends on me.\"\n\n\"Laissez faire,\" said I, smiling.\n\n\"This is no laissez faire,\" he replied, glancing round, \"this is pulling the nipple out of your lips, and letting the milk run away sour. Look there!\"\n\nThrough the thin veil of moonlit mist that slid over the hillside we could see an army of rabbits bunched up, or hopping a few paces forward, feeding.\n\nWe set off at a swinging pace down the hill, scattering the hosts. As we approached the fence that bounded the Mill fields, he exclaimed, \"Hullo!\"\u2014and hurried forward. I followed him, and observed the dark figure of a man rise from the hedge. It was a game-keeper. He pretended to be examining his gun. As we came up he greeted us with a calm \"Good-evenin'!\"\n\nGeorge replied by investigating the little gap in the hedge.\n\n\"I'll trouble you for that snare,\" he said.\n\n\"Will yer?\" answered Annable, a broad, burly, black-faced fellow. \"An' I should like ter know what you're doin' on th' wrong side th' 'edge?\"\n\n\"You can see what we're doing\u2014hand over my snare\u2014and the rabbit,\" said George angrily.\n\n\"What rabbit?\" said Annable, turning sarcastically to me.\n\n\"You know well enough\u2014an' you can hand it over\u2014or\u2014\u2014\" George replied.\n\n\"Or what? Spit it out! The sound won't kill me\"\u2014the man grinned with contempt.\n\n\"Hand over here!\" said George, stepping up to the man in a rage.\n\n\"Now don't!\" said the keeper, standing stock still, and looking unmovedly at the proximity of George:\n\n\"You'd better get off home\u2014both you an' 'im. You'll get neither snare nor rabbit\u2014see!\"\n\n\"We will see!\" said George, and he made a sudden move to get hold of the man's coat. Instantly he went staggering back with a heavy blow under the left ear.\n\n\"Damn brute!\" I ejaculated, bruising my knuckles against the fellow's jaw. Then I too found myself sitting dazedly on the grass, watching the great skirts of his velveteens flinging round him as if he had been a demon, as he strode away. I got up, pressing my chest where I had been struck. George was lying in the hedge-bottom. I turned him over, and rubbed his temples, and shook the drenched grass on his face. He opened his eyes and looked at me, dazed. Then he drew his breath quickly, and put his hand to his head.\n\n\"He\u2014he nearly stunned me,\" he said.\n\n\"The devil!\" I answered.\n\n\"I wasn't ready.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Did he knock me down?\"\n\n\"Ay\u2014me too.\"\n\nHe was silent for some time, sitting limply. Then he pressed his hand against the back of his head, saying, \"My head does sing!\" He tried to get\n\nup, but failed. \"Good God!\u2014being knocked into this state by a damned keeper!\"\n\n\n\"Come on,\" I said, \"let's see if we can't get indoors.\"\n\n\"No!\" he said quickly, \"we needn't tell them\u2014don't let them know.\"\n\nI sat thinking of the pain in my own chest, and wishing I could remember hearing Annable's jaw smash, and wishing that my knuckles were more bruised than they were\u2014though that was bad enough. I got up, and helped George to rise. He swayed, almost pulling me over. But in a while he could walk unevenly.\n\n\"Am I,\" he said, \"covered with clay and stuff?\"\n\n\"Not much,\" I replied, troubled by the shame and confusion with which he spoke.\n\n\"Get it off,\" he said, standing still to be cleaned.\n\nI did my best. Then we walked about the fields for a time, gloomy, silent, and sore.\n\nSuddenly, as we went by the pond-side, we were startled by great, swishing black shadows that swept just above our heads. The swans were flying up for shelter, now that a cold wind had begun to fret Nethermere. They swung down on to the glassy mill-pond, shaking the moonlight in flecks across the deep shadows; the night rang with the clacking of their wings on the water; the stillness and calm were broken; the moonlight was furrowed and scattered, and broken. The swans, as they sailed into shadow, were dim, haunting spectres; the wind found us shivering.\n\n\"Don't\u2014you won't say anything?\" he asked as I was leaving him.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nothing at all\u2014not to anybody?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Good-night.\"\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAbout the end of September, our countryside was alarmed by the harrying of sheep by strange dogs. One morning, the squire, going the round of his fields as was his custom, to his grief and horror found two of his sheep torn and dead in the hedge-bottom, and the rest huddled in a corner swaying about in terror, smeared with blood. The squire did not recover his spirits for days.\n\nThere was a report of two grey wolvish dogs. The squire's keeper had heard yelping in the fields of Dr. Collins of the Abbey, about dawn. Three sheep lay soaked in blood when the labourer went to tend the flocks.\n\nThen the farmers took alarm. Lord, of the White House farm, intended to put his sheep in pen, with his dogs in charge. It was Saturday, however, and the lads ran off to the little travelling theatre that had halted at Westwold. While they sat open-mouthed in the theatre, gloriously nicknamed the \"Blood-Tub,\" watching heroes die with much writhing and heaving, and struggling up to say a word, and collapsing without having said it, six of their silly sheep were slaughtered in the field. At every house it was enquired of the dog; nowhere had one been loose.\n\nMr. Saxton had some thirty sheep on the Common. George determined that the easiest thing was for him to sleep out with them. He built a shelter of hurdles interlaced with brushwood, and in the sunny afternoon we collected piles of bracken, browning to the ruddy winter-brown now. He slept there for a week, but that week aged his mother like a year. She was out in the cold morning twilight watching, with her apron over her head, for his approach. She did not rest with the thought of him out on the Common.\n\nTherefore, on Saturday night he brought down his rugs, and took up Gyp to watch in his stead. For some time we sat looking at the stars over the dark hills. Now and then a sheep coughed, or a rabbit rustled beneath the brambles, and Gyp whined. The mist crept over the gorse-bushes, and the webs on the brambles were white;\u2014the devil throws his net over the blackberries as soon as September's back is turned, they say.\n\n\"I saw two fellows go by with bags and nets,\" said George, as we sat looking out of his little shelter.\n\n\"Poachers,\" said I. \"Did you speak to them?\"\n\n\"No\u2014they didn't see me. I was dropping asleep when a rabbit rushed under the blanket, all of a shiver, and a whippet dog after it. I gave the whippet a punch in the neck, and he yelped off. The rabbit stopped with me quite a long time\u2014then it went.\"\n\n\"How did you feel?\"\n\n\"I didn't care. I don't care much what happens just now. Father could get along without me, and mother has the children. I think I shall emigrate.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you before?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. There are a lot of little comforts and interests at home that one would miss. Besides, you feel somebody in your own countryside, and you're nothing in a foreign part, I expect.\"\n\n\"But you're going?\"\n\n\"What is there to stop here for? The valley is all running wild and unprofitable. You've no freedom for thinking of what the other folks think of you, and everything round you keeps the same, and so you can't change yourself\u2014because everything you look at brings up the same old feeling, and stops you from feeling fresh things. And what is there that's worth anything?\u2014What's worth having in my life?\"\n\n\"I thought,\" said I, \"your comfort was worth having.\"\n\nHe sat still and did not answer.\n\n\"What's shaken you out of your nest?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don't know. I've not felt the same since that row with Annable. And Lettie said to me: 'Here, you can't live as you like\u2014in any way or circumstance. You're like a bit out of those coloured marble mosaics in the hall, you have to fit in your own set, fit into your own pattern, because you're put there from the first. But you don't want to be like a fixed bit of a mosaic\u2014you want to fuse into life, and melt and mix with the rest of folk, to have some things burned out of you\u2014\u2014' She was downright serious.\"\n\"Well, you need not believe her. When did you see her?\"\n\n\"She came down on Wednesday, when I was getting the apples in the morning. She climbed a tree with me, and there was a wind, that was why I was getting all the apples, and it rocked us, me right up at the top, she sitting half way down holding the basket. I asked her didn't she think that free kind of life was the best, and that was how she answered me.\"\n\n\"You should have contradicted her.\"\n\n\"It seemed true. I never thought of it being wrong, in fact.\"\n\n\"Come\u2014that sounds bad.\"\n\n\n\"No\u2014I thought she looked down on us\u2014on our way of life. I thought she meant I was like a toad in a hole.\"\n\n\"You should have shown her different.\"\n\n\"How could I when I could see no different?\"\n\n\"It strikes me you're in love.\"\n\nHe laughed at the idea, saying, \"No, but it is rotten to find that there isn't a single thing you have to be proud of.\"\n\n\"This is a new tune for you.\"\n\nHe pulled the grass moodily.\n\n\"And when do you think of going?\"\n\n\"Oh\u2014I don't know\u2014I've said nothing to mother. Not yet,\u2014at any rate not till spring.\"\n\n\"Not till something has happened,\" said I.\n\n\"What?\" he asked.\n\n\n\"Something decisive.\"\n\n\"I don't know what can happen\u2014unless the Squire turns us out.\"\n\n\"No?\" I said.\n\nHe did not speak.\n\n\"You should make things happen,\" said I.\n\n\"Don't make me feel a worse fool, Cyril,\" he replied despairingly.\n\nGyp whined and jumped, tugging her chain to follow us. The grey blurs among the blackness of the bushes were resting sheep. A chill, dim mist crept along the ground.\n\n\"But, for all that, Cyril,\" he said, \"to have her laugh at you across the table; to hear her sing as she moved about, before you are washed at night, when the fire's warm, and you're tired; to have her sit by you on the hearth seat, close and soft. . . .\"\n\n\"In Spain,\" I said. \"In Spain.\"\n\nHe took no notice, but turned suddenly, laughing.\n\n\"Do you know, when I was stooking up, lifting the sheaves, it felt like having your arm round a girl. It was quite a sudden sensation.\"\n\n\"You'd better take care,\" said I, \"you'll mesh yourself in the silk of dreams, and then\u2014\u2014\"\n\nHe laughed, not having heard my words.\n\n\"The time seems to go like lightning\u2014thinking\" he confessed\u2014\"I seem to sweep the mornings up in a handful.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord!\" said I. \"Why don't you scheme forgetting what you want, instead of dreaming fulfilments?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he replied. \"If it was a fine dream, wouldn't you want to go on dreaming?\" and with that he finished, and I went home.\n\nI sat at my window looking out, trying to get things straight. Mist rose, and wreathed round Nethermere, like ghosts meeting and embracing sadly. I thought of the time when my friend should not follow the harrow on our own snug valley side, and when Lettie's room next mine should be closed to hide its emptiness, not its joy. My heart clung passionately to the hollow which held us all; how could I bear that it should be desolate! I wondered what Lettie would do.\n\nIn the morning I was up early, when daybreak came with a shiver through the woods. I went out, while the moon still shone sickly in the west. The world shrank from the morning. It was then that the last of the summer things died. The wood was dark,\u2014and smelt damp and heavy with autumn. On the paths the leaves lay clogged.\n\nAs I came near the farm I heard the yelling of dogs. Running, I reached the Common, and saw the sheep huddled and scattered in groups, something leaped round them. George burst into sight pursuing. Directly, there was the bang, bang of a gun. I picked up a heavy piece of sandstone and ran forwards. Three sheep scattered wildly before me. In the dim light I saw their grey shadows move among the gorse bushes. Then a dog leaped, and I flung my stone with all my might. I hit. There came a high-pitched howling yelp of pain; I saw the brute make off, and went after him, dodging the prickly bushes, leaping the trailing brambles. The gunshots rang out again, and I heard the men shouting with excitement. My dog was out of sight, but I followed still, slanting down the hill. In a field ahead I saw someone running. Leaping the low hedge, I pursued, and overtook Emily, who was hurrying as fast as she could through the wet grass. There was another gunshot and great shouting. Emily glanced round, saw me, and started.\n\n\"It's gone to the quarries,\" she panted. We walked on, without saying a word. Skirting the spinney, we followed the brook course, and came at last to the quarry fence. The old excavations were filled now with trees. The steep walls, twenty feet deep in places, were packed with loose stones, and trailed with hanging brambles. We climbed down the steep bank of the brook, and entered the quarries by the bed of the stream. Under the groves of ash and oak a pale primrose still lingered, glimmering wanly beside the hidden water. Emily found a smear of blood on a beautiful trail of yellow convolvulus. We followed the tracks on to the open, where the brook flowed on the hard rock bed, and the stony floor of the quarry was only a tangle of gorse and bramble and honeysuckle.\n\n\"Take a good stone,\" said I, and we pressed on, where the grove in the great excavation darkened again, and the brook slid secretly under the arms of the bushes and the hair of the long grass. We beat the cover almost to the road. I thought the brute had escaped, and I pulled a bunch of mountain-ash berries, and stood tapping them against my knee. I was startled by a snarl and a little scream. Running forward, I came upon one of the old, horse-shoe lime kilns that stood at the head of the quarry. There, in the mouth of one of the kilns, Emily was kneeling on the dog, her hands buried in the hair of its throat, pushing back its head. The little jerks of the brute's body were the spasms of death; already the eyes were turning inward, and the upper lip was drawn from the teeth by pain.\n\n\"Good Lord, Emily! But he is dead!\" exclaimed.\n\n\"Has he hurt you?\" I drew her away. She shuddered violently, and seemed to feel a horror of herself.\n\n\"No\u2014no,\" she said, looking at herself, with blood all on her skirt, where she had knelt on the wound which I had given the dog, and pressed the broken rib into the chest. There was a trickle of blood on her arm.\n\n\"Did he bite you?\" I asked, anxious.\n\n\"No\u2014oh, no\u2014I just peeped in, and he jumped. But he had no strength, and I hit him back with my stone, and I lost my balance, and fell on him.\"\n\n\"Let me wash your arm.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed, \"isn't it horrible! Oh, I think it is so awful.\"\n\n\"What?\" said I, busy bathing her arm in the cold water of the brook.\n\n\"This\u2014this whole brutal affair.\"\n\n\"It ought to be cauterised,\" said I, looking at a score on her arm from the dog's tooth.\n\n\"That scratch\u2014that's nothing! Can you get that off my skirt\u2014I feel hateful to myself.\"\n\nI washed her skirt with my handkerchief as well as I could, saying:\n\n\"Let me just sear it for you; we can go to the Kennels. Do\u2014you ought\u2014I don't feel safe otherwise.\"\n\n\"Really,\" she said, glancing up at me, a smile coming into her fine dark eyes.\n\n\"Yes\u2014come along.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha!\" she laughed. \"You look so serious.\"\n\nI took her arm and drew her away. She linked her arm in mine and leaned on me.\n\n\"It is just like Lorna Doone,\" she said as if she enjoyed it.\n\n\"But you will let me do it,\" said I, referring to the cauterising.\n\n\"You make me; but I shall feel\u2014ugh, I daren't think of it. Get me some of those berries.\"\n\nI plucked a few bunches of guelder-rose fruits, transparent, ruby berries. She stroked them softly against her lips and cheek, caressing them. Then she murmured to herself:\n\n\"I have always wanted to put red berries in my hair.\"\n\nThe shawl she had been wearing was thrown across her shoulders, and her head was bare, and her black hair, soft and short and ecstatic, tumbled wildly into loose light curls. She thrust the stalks of the berries under her combs. Her hair was not heavy or long enough to have held them. Then, with the ruby bunches glowing through the black mist of curls, she looked up at me, brightly, with wide eyes. I looked at her, and felt the smile winning into her eyes. Then I turned and dragged a trail of golden-leaved convolvulus from the hedge, and I twisted it into a coronet for her.\n\n\"There!\" said I, \"you're crowned.\"\n\nShe put back her head, and the low laughter shook in her throat.\n\n\"What!\" she asked, putting all the courage and recklessness she had into the question, and in her soul trembling.\n\n\"Not Chlo\u00eb, not Bacchante. You have always got your soul in your eyes, such an earnest, troublesome soul.\"\n\nThe laughter faded at once, and her great seriousness looked out again at me, pleading.\n\n\"You are like Burne-Jones' damsels. Troublesome shadows are always crowding across your eyes, and you cherish them. You think the flesh of the apple is nothing, nothing. You only care for the eternal pips. Why don't you snatch your apple and eat it, and throw the core away?\"\n\nShe looked at me sadly, not understanding, but believing that I in my wisdom spoke truth, as she always believed when I lost her in a maze of words. She stooped down, and the chaplet fell from her hair, and only one bunch of berries remained. The ground around us was strewn with the four-lipped burrs of beechnuts, and the quaint little nut-pyramids were scattered among the ruddy fallen leaves. Emily gathered a few nuts.\n\n\"I love beechnuts,\" she said, \"but they make me long for my childhood again till I could almost cry out. To go out for beechnuts before breakfast; to thread them for necklaces before supper;\u2014to be the envy of the others at school next day! There was as much pleasure in a beech necklace then as there is in the whole autumn now\u2014and no sadness. There are no more unmixed joys after you have grown up.\" She kept her face to the ground as she spoke, and she continued to gather the fruits.\n\n\"Do you find any with nuts in?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not many\u2014here\u2014here are two, three. You have them. No\u2014I don't care about them.\"\n\nI stripped one of its horny brown coat and gave it to her. She opened her mouth slightly to take it, looking up into my eyes. Some people, instead of bringing with them clouds of glory, trail clouds of sorrow; they are born with \"the gift of sorrow\"; \"sorrows\" they proclaim \"alone are real. The veiled grey angels of sorrow work out slowly the beautiful shapes. Sorrow is beauty, and the supreme blessedness.\" You read it in their eyes, and in the tones of their voices. Emily had the gift of sorrow. It fascinated me, but it drove me to rebellion.\n\nWe followed the soft, smooth-bitten turf road under the old beeches. The hillside fell away, dishevelled with thistles and coarse grass. Soon we were in sight of the Kennels, the red old Kennels which had been the scene of so much animation in the time of Lord Byron. They were empty now, overgrown with weeds. The barred windows of the cottages were grey with dust; there was no need now to protect the windows from cattle, dog or man. One of the three houses was inhabited. Clear water trickled through a wooden runnel into a great stone trough outside near the door.\n\n\"Come here,\" said I to Emily. \"Let me fasten the back of your dress.\"\n\n\"Is it undone?\" she asked, looking quickly over her shoulder, and blushing.\n\nAs I was engaged in my task, a girl came out of the cottage with a black kettle and a tea-cup. She was so surprised to see me thus occupied that she forgot her own duty, and stood open-mouthed.\n\n\"S'r Ann! S'r Ann,\" called a voice from inside. \"Are ter goin' ter come in an' shut that door?\"\n\nSarah Ann hastily poured a few cupfuls of water into the kettle, then she put down both utensils and stood holding her bare arms to warm them. Her chief garment consisted of a skirt with grey bodice and red flannel skirt, very much torn. Her black hair hung in wild tails on to her shoulders.\n\n\"We must go in here,\" said I, approaching the girl. She, however, hastily seized the kettle and ran indoors with an \"Oh, mother!\"\n\nA woman came to the door. One breast was bare, and hung over her blouse, which, like a dressing-jacket, fell loose over her skirt. Her fading, red-brown hair was all frowsy from the bed. In the folds of her skirt clung a swarthy urchin with a shockingly short shirt. He stared at us with big black eyes, the only portion of his face undecorated with egg and jam. The woman's blue eyes questioned us languidly. I told her our errand.\n\n\"Come in\u2014come in,\" she said, \"but dunna look at th' 'ouse. Th' childers not been long up. Go in, Billy, wi' nowt on!\"\n\nWe entered, taking the forgotten kettle lid. The kitchen was large, but scantily furnished save, indeed, for children. The eldest, a girl of twelve or so, was standing toasting a piece of bacon with one hand, and holding back her nightdress in the other. As the toast hand got scorched, she transferred the bacon to the other, gave the hot fingers a lick to cool them, and then held back her nightdress again. Her auburn hair hung in heavy coils down her gown. A boy sat on the steel fender, catching the dropping fat on a piece of bread. \"One, two, three, four, five, six drops,\" and he quickly bit off the tasty corner, and resumed the task with the other hand. When we entered he tried to draw his shirt over his knees, which caused the fat to fall wasted. A fat baby, evidently laid down from the breast, lay kicking on the squab, purple in the face, while another lad was pushing bread and butter into its mouth. The mother swept to the sofa, poked out the bread and butter, pushed her finger into the baby's throat, lifted the child up, punched its back, and was highly relieved when it began to yell. Then she administered a few sound spanks to the naked buttocks of the crammer. He began to howl, but stopped suddenly on seeing us laughing. On the sack-cloth which served as hearth rug sat a beautiful child washing the face of a wooden doll with tea, and wiping it on her nightgown. At the table, an infant in a high chair sat sucking a piece of bacon, till the grease ran down his swarthy arms, oozing through his fingers. An old lad stood in the big arm-chair, whose back was hung with a calf-skin, and was industriously pouring the dregs of the teacups into a basin of milk. The mother whisked away the milk, and made a rush for the urchin, the baby hanging over her arm the while.\n\n\"I could half kill thee,\" she said, but he had slid under the table,\u2014and sat serenely unconcerned.\n\n\"Could you\"\u2014I asked when the mother had put her bonny baby again to her breast\u2014\"could you lend me a knitting needle?\"\n\n\"Our S'r Ann, wheer's thy knittin' needles?\" asked the woman, wincing at the same time, and putting her hand to the mouth of the sucking child. Catching my eye, she said:\n\n\"You wouldn't credit how he bites. 'E's nobbut two teeth, but they like six needles.\" She drew her brows together and pursed her lips, saying to the child, \"Naughty lad, naughty lad! Tha' shanna hae it, no, not if ter bites thy mother like that.\"\n\nThe family interest was now divided between us and the private concerns in process when we entered;\u2014save, however, that the bacon sucker had sucked on stolidly, immovable, all the time.\n\n\n\"Our Sam, wheer's my knittin', tha's 'ad it?\" cried S'r Ann after a little search.\n\n\"'A 'e na,\" replied Sam from under the table.\n\n\"Yes, tha' 'as,\" said the mother, giving a blind prod under the table with her foot.\n\n\"'A 'e na then!\" persisted Sam.\n\nThe mother suggested various possible places of discovery, and at last the knitting was found at the back of the table drawer, among forks and old wooden skewers.\n\n\"I 'an ter tell yer wheer ivrythink is,\" said the mother in mild reproach. S'r Ann, however, gave no heed to her parent. Her heart was torn for her knitting, the fruit of her labours; it was a red woollen cuff for the winter; a corkscrew was bored through the web, and the ball of red wool was bristling with skewers.\n\n\"It's a' thee, our Sam,\" she wailed. \"I know it's a' thee an' thy A. B. C.\"\n\nSamuel, under the table, croaked out in a voice of fierce monotony:\n\n\"P. is for Porkypine, whose bristles so strong\n\n\nKill the bold lion by pricking 'is tongue.\"\n\nThe mother began to shake with quiet laughter.\n\n\"His father learnt him that\u2014made it all up,\" she whispered proudly to us\u2014and to him.\n\n\"Tell us what 'B' is Sam.\"\n\n\"Shonna,\" grunted Sam.\n\n\"Go on, there's a duckie; an' I'll ma' 'e a treacle puddin'.\"\n\n\"Today?\" asked S'r Ann eagerly.\n\n\"Go on, Sam, my duck,\" persisted the mother.\n\n\"Tha' 'as na got no treacle,\" said Sam conclusively.\n\nThe needle was in the fire; the children stood about watching.\n\n\"Will you do it yourself?\" I asked Emily.\n\n\"I!\" she exclaimed, with wide eyes of astonishment, and she shook her head emphatically.\n\n\"Then I must.\" I took out the needle, holding it in my handkerchief. I took her hand and examined the wound. But when she saw the hot glow of the needle, she snatched away her hand, and looked into my eyes, laughing in a half-hysterical fear and shame. I was very serious, very insistent. She yielded me her hand again, biting her lips in imagination of the pain, and looking at me. While my eyes were looking into hers she had courage; when I was forced to pay attention to my cauterising, she glanced down, and with a sharp \"Ah!\" ending in a little laugh, she put her hands behind her, and looked again up at me with wide brown eyes, all quivering with apprehension, and a little shame, and a laughter that held much pleading.\n\nOne of the children began to cry.\n\n\"It is no good,\" said I, throwing the fast cooling needle on to the hearth.\n\nI gave the girls all the pennies I had\u2014then I offered Sam, who had crept out of the shelter of the table, a sixpence.\n\n\"Shonna a'e that,\" he said, turning from the small coin.\n\n\"Well\u2014I have no more pennies, so nothing will be your share.\"\n\nI gave the other boy a rickety knife I had in my pocket. Sam looked fiercely at me. Eager for revenge, he picked up the \"porkypine quill\" by the hot end. He dropped it with a shout of rage, and, seizing a cup off the table, flung it at the fortunate Jack. It smashed against the fire-place. The mother grabbed at Sam, but he was gone. A girl, a little girl, wailed, \"Oh, that's my rosey mug\u2014my rosey mug.\" We fled from the scene of confusion. Emily had hardly noticed it. Her thoughts were of herself, and of me.\n\n\n\"I am an awful coward,\" said she humbly.\n\n\"But I can't help it\u2014\u2014\" she looked beseechingly.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said I.\n\n\"All my flesh seems to jump from it. You don't know how I feel.\"\n\n\"Well\u2014never mind.\"\n\n\"I couldn't help it, not for my life.\"\n\n\"I wonder,\" said I, \"if anything could possibly disturb that young bacon-sucker? He didn't even look round at the smash.\"\n\n\"No,\" said she, biting the tip of her finger moodily.\n\nFurther conversation was interrupted by howls from the rear. Looking round we saw Sam careering after us over the close-bitten turf, howling scorn and derision at us. \"Rabbit-tail, rabbit-tail,\" he cried, his bare little legs twinkling, and his little shirt fluttering in the cold morning air. Fortunately, at last he trod on a thistle or a thorn, for when we looked round again to see why he was silent, he was capering on one leg, holding his wounded foot in his hands.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1806466", "artist_names": "Heavy D & The Boyz", "full_title": "Black Coffee by\u00a0Heavy\u00a0D & The Boyz", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/355a27303f1ac0b866eec7c63f679f1e.300x242x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/355a27303f1ac0b866eec7c63f679f1e.600x484x1.jpg", "id": 1806466, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1431612198, "path": "/Heavy-d-and-the-boyz-black-coffee-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Heavy-d-and-the-boyz-black-coffee-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/355a27303f1ac0b866eec7c63f679f1e.300x242x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/355a27303f1ac0b866eec7c63f679f1e.600x484x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Black Coffee", "title_with_featured": "Black Coffee", "updated_by_human_at": 1445441914, "url": "https://genius.com/Heavy-d-and-the-boyz-black-coffee-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/292424", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/355a27303f1ac0b866eec7c63f679f1e.600x484x1.jpg", "id": 292424, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/355a27303f1ac0b866eec7c63f679f1e.600x484x1.jpg", "index_character": "h", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Heavy D & The Boyz", "slug": "Heavy-d-and-the-boyz", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Heavy-d-and-the-boyz"}, "artist": "Heavy D & The Boyz", "lyrics": "Black Coffee LyricsBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nThat's the kind of girl I need down with my team\nBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nThat's the kind of girl I need down with my team\nBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nThat's the kind of girl I need down with my team\nBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nIt's just the way I like it\n\nI need a girl who ain't scared to scrap\nSomeone who got my back\nGotta be a dark skin a light skin\nLike the type of girl that stays busy all day\nBut when the sun goes down\nShe's my sexy soufle\nSomebody real who ain't afraid to work it\nIf you try to disrespect her face\nAround and get her feelings hurt\nShe ain't ? from your ? ? ? ?\nShe'll only flex with a brother that can handle it, a\nAnd I don't care if she's a little bit jealous\nShe can still be a lady while she's coolin' with the fellas\nAn intellectual, beautiful, sexual\nHands on her hip and when she flips she's incredible\nCandlelight ? from her mack\nBut she's a trooper if she has to spill the beans from the can\nA very nice girl but not mistaken for no softy\nAnd that's the way I like it, yeah, my black coffee\nBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nThat's the kind of girl I need down with my team\nBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nThat's the kind of girl I need down with my team\nBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nThat's the kind of girl I need down with my team\nBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nIt's just the way I like it\n\nBlack coffee got the flip like a mitten\nRoars like a lion and when I stroke her kitten\nVersatile when the coke gets mine\nShe got a positive style ain't had none in a while\nParty animal but Biggie only when she with me\nAnd I don't have to worry cos she won't disrespect me\nShe's everything that a man dreams about\nAnd when I'm with my crew she's all I talk about, hey\nFancy here, jewels all flushed\nBackside bigger than a mob but don't touch her\nPrettiest girl she know the ones with the slip\nA closet full of gear so you know she stay ??\nBody so smooth from using plenty lotion\nPerfume smelling like some old sex potion\n\nA very nice girl but not mistaken for no softy\nAnd that's the way I want it, yeah, my black coffee\nYou might also likeBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nThat's the kind of girl I need down with my team\nBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nThat's the kind of girl I need down with my team\nBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nThat's the kind of girl I need down with my team\nBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nIt's just the way I like it\n\nBreak it down\n\nBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\nBlack coffee, no sugar, no cream\n\nBlack coffee, the African queen\nPart of ?
