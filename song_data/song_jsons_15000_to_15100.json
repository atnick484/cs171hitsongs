in\nCan't believe I'm back again\nAfter all these years away\nYou fixed your Daddy's house up nice\nI saw it yesterday when I drove by\nLooks like you've made youself a real good life\nWhat else can I

school\nAnd before that\nSo I don't mind telling you I'm scared to death\nThe doctor's going in on the 25th\nIt's the same thing my daddy had\nThank God they caught it fast\n\nBut if something should happen\nStop in sometime and say hello to Katherine\nYou and Mary Anne could always keep her laughing\nShe's going to need a lot of that\nTake her out to a movie\nIts going to take some time before she's back on her feet\nI know you think that I'll be fine and I'm talking crazy\nBut there's always that chance\nThat's why I'm asking\nIf something should happen\nLittle Nathan's growing up so fast\nThis November he'll turn 10\nHe wants to play quarterback\nI'm supposed to coach his team this fall\nBut I may not get to after all\nHe's going to need someone to catch a pass\nAnd to throw it back\n\nIf something should happen\nOh promise me you'll take that boy out camping\nThrow a line out in that water every now and then\nAnswer any question that he has\nMaybe once he gets older\nYou can sit and have that first cold beer together\nAnd tell him a couple stories on his father\nHe's always known you were my best friend\nThat's why I'm asking\nIf something should happen\n\nI hope I live until I'm 80\nAnd I get to see my son get married\nAnd have babies\nAnd make a million more memories with my wife\nYeah buddy I pray alright\nBut if its my time to leave\nWould you watch over them for me?\nIf something should happen\nIf something should happen\nMm hmm hmmYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/190690", "artist_names": "Tim

We push in close\nto one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\n... and a voice was screaming: Holy\nJesus!  What are these goddamn\nanimals?\n\nCUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -\n\nDUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere.\nGONZO casually looks over...\n\nGONZO\nWhat are you yelling about?\n\nDUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench\nmakes GONZO nick his face with his razor.\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  It's your turn to drive.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNo point mentioning these bats.  I\nthought.  The poor bastard will see\nthem soon enough.\n\nDUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,\nfrantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A\nMOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles\nthrough the impressive stash.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had two bags of grass, seventy-\nfive pellets of mescaline, five\nsheets of high powered blotter\nacid, a salt shaker half full of\ncocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-\ncolored uppers, downers, screamers,\nlaughers... Also a quart of tequila,\na quart of rum, a case of beer, a\npint of raw ether and two dozen\namyls.\n\n3.\n\n\nDUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the\nSHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with\nanother six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives\nback into the car.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNot that we needed all that for the\ntrip, but once you get locked into\na serious drug collection, the\ntendency is to push it as far as\nyou can.\n\nTHE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,\nweakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A\nBAT?\n\nEXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nIN THE RED SHARK\n\nGONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a\nlousy driver.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe only thing that really worried\nme was the ether.  There is nothing\nin the world more helpless and\nirresponsible and depraved than a\nman in the depths of an ether binge.\nAnd I knew we'd get into that\nrotten stuff pretty soon.\n\nThe radio news wars with \"SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL\" on a tape\nrecorder.\n\nRADIO NEWS\nAn overdose of heroin was listed as\nthe official cause of death for\npretty 19 year old Diane Hanby\nwhose body was found stuffed in a\nrefrigerator last week...\n\nGONZO changes the station - \"ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET\nJESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE\" vies with \"SYMPATHY\"... He\nsings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.\nThe RED SHARK fishtails.\n\nGONZO\n\"One toke over the line, sweet\nJesus.\"\n\n4.\n\n\nDUKE\n(muttering to himself)\nOne toke.  You poor fool.  Wait\ntill you see those goddamn bats.\n\nUP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD\n\nA LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a\nthumb.  The RED SHARK roars past.  Then, fifty yards down\nthe road...\n\nGONZO\nLet's give that boy a lift.\n\nGONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side\nof the road.\n\nDUKE\nWe can't stop here - this is bat\ncountry!\n\nGONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.  The\nHITCHHIKER races to the car.  A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.\n\nHITCHHIKER\nHot damn!  I never rode in a\nconvertible before!\n\nThen the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the\nsight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-\nNORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.\n\nDUKE\nIs that right?  Well, I guess\nyou're about ready, eh?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER hesitates.\n\nGONZO\nWe're your friends.  We're not like\nthe others.\n\nDUKE\n(hissing sharply)\nNo more of that talk or I'll put\nthe leeches on you.\n\nDUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.\n\nEXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nThe HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED\nSHARK screams down the road.\n\n5.\n\n\nGONZO sings along to the tape player.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out\nand taking his chances.\n\nDUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear\nview mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHow long could we maintain, I\nwondered.  How long before one of\nus starts raving and jabbering at\nthis boy?  What will he think then?\nThis same lonely desert was the\nlast known home of the Manson family.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling\ndown GONZO's neck.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWould he make that grim connection\nwhen my attorney starts screaming\nabout bats and huge manta rays\ncoming down on the car?\n\nDUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with\nthe words, sometimes not.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIf so - well, we'll just have to\ncut his head off and bury him\nsomewhere.  Because it goes without\nsaying that we can't turn him loose.\nHe'd report us at once to some kind\nof outback Nazi law enforcement\nagency, and they'll run us down\nlike dogs...\n\nDUKE\n(out loud to himself)\nJesus!  Did I say that?\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOr just think it?  Was I talking?\nDid they hear me?\n\nGONZO\n(reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)\nIt's okay.  He's admiring the shape\nof your skull.\n\nDUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER\ngiggles nervously.\n\n6.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMaybe I better have a chat with\nthis boy I thought.  Perhaps if I\nexplain things, he'll rest easy...\n\nDUKE\n(roaring over the\nroad noise)\nTHERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD\nPROBABLY UNDERSTAND --\n\nThe HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.\n\nDUKE\n(yells)\nCAN YOU HEAR ME?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs\ninto the back seat.\n\nDUKE\nThat's good.  Because I want you to\nhave all the background.  This is a\nvery ominous assignment -- with\novertones of extreme personal\ndanger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism!\nThis is important, goddamnit!  This\nis a true story!...\n(WHACKS the BACK OF\nTHE DRIVER'S SEAT\nwith his fist)\n\n\nThe CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.\n\nGONZO\n(screams)\nKeep your hands off my fucking neck!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS\nHIM BACK DOWN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur vibrations were getting nasty --\nbut why?  Was there no communication\nin this car?  Had we deteriorated\nto the level of dumb beasts?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.\n\n7.\n\n\nDUKE\n(to HITCHHIKER)\nI want you to understand that this\nman at the wheel is my attorney!\nHe's not just some dingbat I found\non the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I\nthink he's probably Samoan.  But it\ndoesn't matter, does it?  Are you\nprejudiced?\n\nHITCHHIKER\nHell, no!\n\nDUKE\nI didn't think so.  Because in\nspite of his race, this man is\nextremely valuable to me.  Hell, I\nforgot all about this beer.  You\nwant one?\n(HITCHHIKER shakes\nhis head)\nHow about some ether?\n\nHITCHHIKER\nWhat?\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  Let's get right to the\nheart of this thing.  Twenty-four\nhours ago we were sitting in the\nPogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills\nHotel...\n\nINT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY\n\nA uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE\nthrough the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They\nare the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL\nBOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore\nSlings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED\nVERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\n... in the patio section, of\ncourse, drinking Singapore Slings\nwith mescal on the side, hiding\nfrom the brutish realities of this\nfoul year of Our Lord, 1971.\n\nThe DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and\nshades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank\ntop undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious\nconversation.\n\n8.\n\n\nDUKE\nI'm telling you, the Salazar story\nis getting too complicated.  The\nweasels have started closing in.\n\nThe DWARF sneers.\n\nDWARF\nPerhaps this is the call you've\nbeen waiting for all this time,\nsir...\n\nDUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...\n\nDUKE\nUh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...\n\nDUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A\nMOVIE SPY.\n\nDWARF\nThat was headquarters.  They want\nme to go to Las Vegas at once and\nmake contact with a Portuguese\nphotographer named Lacerda.  He'll\nhave the details.  All I have to do\nis check into my sound proof suite\nand he'll seek me out.\n\nGONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!\n\nGONZO\nGod hell!  I think I see the\npattern!  This one sounds like real\ntrouble!  You're going to need\nplenty of legal advice before this\nthing is over.  As your attorney I\nmust advise you that you'll need a\nvery fast car with no top and after\nthat, the cocaine.  And then the\ntape recorder, for special music,\nand some Acapulco shirts...\n(GONZO tucks his\nkhaki undershirt into\nhis white\nbellbottoms -- he\nmeans business!)\nThis blows my weekend, because\nnaturally I'll have to go with\nyou -- and we'll have to arm\nourselves.\n\n9.\n\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  If a thing's worth doing,\nit's worth doing right.\n\nDUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them\nwith the (very large) check in his hand.\n\nThey sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it\nswinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.\n\nDUKE\nI tell you, my man.  This is the\nAmerican Dream in action!  We'd be\nfools not to ride this strange\ntorpedo all the way to the end.\n\nGONZO\nIndeed.  We must do it.  What kind\nof story is this?\n\nEXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY\n\nDUKE and GONZO emerge.\n\nDUKE\nThe Mint 400!  The richest off-road\nrace for motorcycles and dune-\nbuggies in the history of organized\nsport!\n(handing parking\nticket to Valet)\n-- a fantastic spectacle in honor\nof some fatback grossero who owns\nthe luxurious Mint Hotel in the\nheart of downtown Vegas... at least\nthat's what the press release says.\n\nTheir car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.  They\njump in.\n\nDUKE\nWe're going to have to drum it up\non our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.\n\nAnd they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-\nbleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY\n\nThe PINTO races through shot.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nGetting hold of the drugs and\nshirts had been no problem...\n\n10.\n\n\nEXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY\n\nThe PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back\nwindow full of Hawaiian shirts.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\n... but the car and tape recorder\nwere not easy things to round up at\n6:30 on a Friday afternoon in\nHollywood.\n\nINT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY\n\nTORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile\nas GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE.  DUKE carries over four\nSingapore Slings.\n\nGONZO\nO.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it.\nWe'll be there in thirty minutes.\n(to DUKE -- hand over\nthe PHONE)\nI finally located a car with\nadequate horsepower and the proper\ncoloring.\n(into PHONE)\nWhat?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has\na major credit card!  Do you\nrealize who the fuck you're talking\nto?\n\nDUKE\nDon't take any guff from these\nswine.\n(GONZO slams the\nphone down)\nNow we need a sound store with the\nfinest equipment.  Nothing dinky.\nOne of those new Belgian Heliowatts\nwith a voice-activated shotgun\nmike, for picking up conversations\nin oncoming cars.\n\nGONZO\nWe won't make the nut unless we\nhave unlimited credit.\n\nDUKE\nWe will.  You Samoans are all the\nsame.  You have no faith in the\nessential decency of the white\nman's culture.\n\n11.\n\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK\n\nThe PINTO races down street.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe store was closed, but the\nsalesman said he would wait, if we\nhurried...\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK\n\nThey're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.  DUKE\nBANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut we were delayed en route when a\nStingray in front of us killed a\npedestrain.\n\nDirectly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered\ncorpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.\n\nEXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had trouble, again, at the car\nrental agency.\n\nBehind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with\nsatisfaction -- checking it out.  A nervous AGENT holds out\na clipboard.  DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.\n\nAGENT\nSay... uh... you fellas are going\nto be careful with this car, aren't\nyou?\n\nDUKE\nOf course.\n\nDUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the\ngas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.\n\nAGENT\nWell, good god!  You just backed\nover that two foot concrete abutment\nand you didn't even slow down!\nForty-five in reverse!  And you\nbarely missed the pump!\n\nDUKE\nNo harm done.  I always test the\ntransmission that way.  The rear\nend.  For stress factors.\n\n12.\n\n\nGONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box\nof rum and ice into the RED SHARK.\n\nAGENT\nSay.  Are you fellows drinking?\n\nDUKE\nNot me.  We're responsible people.\n\nHe JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.  The\nAGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.\n\nGONZO\nThere's another worrier.  He's\nprobably all cranked up on speed.\n\nEXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nSTRANGE AND MAGICAL.  In the moonlight: the silhouetted\nfigures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe spent the rest of that night\nrounding up materials and packing\nthe car.  Then we ate some mescaline\nand went swimming.\n\nThe surf crashes in the distance...\n\nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT\n\nDUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself\nfloat up through the silvery bubbles...\n\nDUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING\nMOONLIT SURF.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur trip was different.  It was to\nbe a classic affirmation of\neverything right and true in the\nnational character; a gross,\nphysical salute to the fantastic\npossibilities of life in this\ncountry.  But only for those with\ntrue grit...\n\nEXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nDUKE's intense face.\n\nDUKE\n...and we're chock full of that!\n\n13.\n\n\nGONZO\nDamn right!\n\nDUKE\nMy attorney understands this\nconcept, despite his racial handicap.\nBut do you?!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHe said he understood, but I could\nsee in his eyes that he didn't.  He\nwas lying to me.\n\nGONZO\nMy heart!\n\nGONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and\nscreeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel.\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\nWhere's the medicine?\n\nDUKE\nThe medicine?  Yes, it's right here.\n\nDUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.\n\nDUKE\nDon't worry, this man has a bad\nheart... Angina Pectoris.  But we\nhave a cure for it.\n\nDUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO\nfalls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The\nHITCHHIKER looks petrified.\n\nGONZO\n(suddenly flailing\nhis naked arms at the sky)\nTurn up the fucking music!  My\nheart feels like an alligator!\nVolume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must\nhave bass!  What's wrong with us?\nAre you goddamn old ladies?\n\nDUKE\n(turns up music to\nfull volume)\nYou scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch\nyour language!  You're talking to a\nDoctor of Journalism!\n\n14.\n\n\nGONZO\n(laughing uncontrollably)\nWhat the fuck are we doing out here?\nSomebody call the police!  We need\nhelp!\n\nDUKE\n(to HITCHHIKER)\nPay no attention to this swine.  He\ncan't handle the medicine.\n(he begins laughing)\n\n\nGONZO\n(to the HITCHHIKER)\nThe truth is we're going to Vegas\nto croak a scag baron named Savage\nHenry.  I've known him for years\nbut he ripped us off -- and you\nknow what that means, right?\n\nGONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\nSavage Henry has cashed his check!\nWe're going to rip his lungs out!\n\nDUKE\nAnd eat them!  That bastard won't\nget away with this!  What's going\non in this country when a scum\nsucker like that can get away with\nsandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?\n\nGONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID,\nAND FLEES.\n\nHITCHHIKER\nThanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot.\nI like you guys.  Don't worry about\nme.\n\nDUKE\n(yells)\nWait a minute!  Come back and have\na beer!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER RUNS from car.\n\n15.\n\n\nGONZO\nGood riddance.  That boy made me\nnervous.  Did you see his eyes?\n(laughing)\nJesus, this is good medicine.\n\nDUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER.\n\nDUKE\n(suddenly clambering\ninto the front seat)\nMove over!!  We have to get out of\nCalifornia before that kid finds a\ncop!\n\nDUKE GUNS THE RED SHARK -- TAKES OFF DOWN THE ROAD...\n\nEXT. UNBELIEVABLY FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nTHE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead\ndriving.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt was absolutely imperative that\nwe get to the Mint Hotel before the\ndeadline for press registration.\nOtherwise, we might have to pay for\nour suite.\n\nGONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.  The top comes off\nand the powder swirls away on the wind.\n\nGONZO\nOh, Jesus!  Did you see what god\njust did to us?\n\nDUKE\nGod didn't do that!  You did it!\nYou're a fucking narcotics agent,\nthat was our cocaine, you pig!\n\nGONZO\n(waving his .357\nMagnum at Duke)\nYou better be careful.  Plenty of\nvultures out here.  They'll pick\nyour bones clean before morning.\n\nDUKE\nYou whore!\n\nGONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID.\n\n16.\n\n\nGONZO\nHere -- chew this.  It's your half\nof the acid.\n\nDUKE takes his half -- chews it.\n\nDUKE\nHow long do I have?\n\nGONZO\nMaybe thirty more minutes.  As your\nattorney, I advise you to drive at\ntop speed.  It'll be a goddamn\nmiracle if we can get there before\nyou turn into a wild animal.  Are\nyou ready for that?  Checking into\na Vegas hotel under a phony name\nwith intent to commit capital fraud\nand a head full of acid.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThirty minutes.  It was going to be\nvery close.\n\nThe RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard:\n\"DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \\ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20\nYEARS; SALE - LIFE!!\"\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL - DUSK\n\nThe RED SHARK pulls up outside the MINT.  A great banner\nspanning the street announces the MINT 400.\n\nDUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him.  Clutching a\nbuckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the\nTICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.\n\nDUKE\nI need this, right?\n\nATTENDANT\nI'll remember your face.\n\nDUKE stares -- losing it...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere is no way of explaining the\nterror I felt.\n\nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\nDUKE waits in line at the front desk -- RIGID WITH PENT UP\nENERGY.  GONZO's ahead of him -- muscling in -- trying to\nqueue jump and failing.\n\n17.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI was pouring sweat.  My blood is\ntoo thick for Nevada.  I've never\nbeen able to properly explain\nmyself in this climate.\n\nA COUPLE move off and DUKE jerks forward -- stops -- eyes\nfixed on the stony FEMALE RESERVATIONS CLERK.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\nBe quiet, be calm... name, rank,\nand press affiliation, nothing\nelse...\n\nDUKE moves ANOTHER RIGID STEP CLOSER to the desk -- the\ntension almost snapping him in two.  GONZO's FLAPPING\nAROUND -- absolutely no success.\n\nSomething catches DUKE's eye... He REMAINS ROOTED -- his\neyes turning to the VEGETAL PAISLEY PATTERNS ON THE CARPET\nWHICH ARE SHIFTING -- UNDULATING.  THE CARPET PATTERNS ARE\nINEXORABLY CREEPING UP THE WALLS...\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\n...ignore this terrible drug,\npretend it's not happening...\n\nThe LAST PEOPLE leave -- with A FINAL, STIFF MOVE, DUKE\ncomes face to face with the RESERVATIONS CLERK... AND\nEXPLODES!\n\nDUKE\nHI THERE.  MY NAME... AH, RAOUL\nDUKE... ON... ON THAT LIST, THAT'S\nFOR SURE.  FREE LUNCH, FINAL\nWISDOM, TOTAL COVERAGE... WHY NOT?\nI HAVE MY ATTORNEY WITH ME, AND I\nREALIZE OF COURSE...\n\nAs DUKE stares at her, BABBLING, her FACE BEGINS TO MORPH.\nHe tries to stop it happening by TALKING FASTER.\n\nDUKE\n... THAT HIS NAME IS NOT ON THE\nLIST, BUT WE MUST HAVE THAT SUITE.\nYES.  JUST CHECK THE LIST AND\nYOU'LL SEE.  DON'T WORRY.  WHAT'S\nTHE SCORE HERE?  WHAT'S NEXT?\n\nDUKE sags -- grips the desk -- WHITE KNUCKLES.\n\n18.\n\n\nRESERVATIONS CLERK\n(hands him an envelope)\nYour suite's not ready yet.  But\nthere's somebody looking for you.\n\nHer face is CHANGING -- SWELLING -- PULSING...\n\nDUKE\n(shouts)\nNO!  WHY?  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING\nYET!\n\nThe FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN & GROWS FANGS.\nDEADLY POISON!  DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm\nintensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE.\n\nGONZO\nI can handle this.  This man has a\nbad heart, but I have plenty of\nmedicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo.\nPrepare our suite at once.  We'll\nbe in the bar.\n\nGONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.  DUKE looks\nback -- the RESERVATIONS CLERKS is now a MORAY EEL -- green\njowls and fangs.\n\nINT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY\n\nThe bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme.\nDUKE and GONZO at the bar, a marlin spike hanging on the\nwall behind them.  DUKE has turned to stone...\n\nGONZO\n(to the bartender)\nTwo Cuba Libres with beer and\nmescal on the side.\n(opens the envelope)\nWho's Lacerda, he's waiting for us\nin a room on the twelfth floor?\n\nDUKE\nLacerda?\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI couldn't remember.  The name rang\na bell, but I couldn't concentrate.\nTerrible things were happening all\naround us...\n\nDUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED.  BLOOD FLOWS FREELY\nonto the floor.  DUKE keeps his voice low.\n\n19.\n\n\nDUKE\nOrder some golf shoes.  Otherwise,\nwe'll never get out of this place\nalive.  It's impossible to walk in\nthis muck -- no footing at all...\n\nDUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared.\n\nDUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED\ninto a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND\nGNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI was right in the middle of a\nfucking reptile zoo.  And somebody\nwas giving booze to these goddamn\nthings!  It won't be long before\nthey tear us to shreds!\n\nGONZO IS SUDDENLY BACK -- AT DUKE'S SHOULDER.\n\nGONZO\nIf you think we're in trouble now\nwait until you see what's happening\nin the elevators.\n\nGONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying...\nas he speaks he seems to be floating.  Duke struggles to\nkeep him in his line of vision.\n\nGONZO\nI just went upstairs to see this\nman Lacerda.  I told him I knew\nwhat he was up to...\n(GONZO rallies --\nturns fierce)\nHe says he's a photographer!  But\nwhen I mentioned Savage Henry he\nfreaked!  He knows we're onto him!\n\nDUKE\nBut what about our room?  And the\ngolf shoes?\n\nA GROUP OF REPTILES AT A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM stares at\nthem, BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THEIR FANGS.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\n(grabbing GONZO\ntrying to hold him still)\nHoly shit!  Look at that bunch over\nthere!  They've spotted us!\n\n20.\n\n\nCut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing\nnext to him at the bar.  The room has returned to normality.\nGONZO is sitting in his original position.\n\nGONZO\n(downs his drink --\ngets up)\nThat's the press table.  Where you\nhave to sign in for our credentials.\nShit, let's get it over with.  You\nhandle that, and I'll check on the\nroom.\n\nDUKE\nNo, no.  Don't leave me!\n\nBlack screen.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK\n\nA TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST MONK,\nprotesting the war, sets himself on fire.  A very nervous\nBELL BOY is laying out GONZO's order.  A marlin spike is on\nthe floor next to DUKE.\n\nBELL BOY\nFour club sandwiches, four shrimp\ncocktails.\n\nDUKE\nThere's a big... machine in the\nsky... some kind of electric snake...\n\nDUKE is curled by the window -- MESMERIZED by an unseen neon\nsign outside the window.

I wanted\nsomething to cut the limes.\n\nGONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- INTO EIGHTHS!\n\nDUKE\nWhat limes?\n\nGONZO SLICES -- SIXTEENTHS!\n\n41.\n\n\nGONZO\nThey didn't have any.  They don't\ngrow in the desert.\n\nSLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!\n\nGONZO\nThat dirty toad bastard!  I knew I\nshould have taken him out when I\nhad the chance.  Now he has her.\n\nSLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO SLASHES INSANELY!\n\nDUKE watches -- straight-faced.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember the girl.  We'd had a\nproblem with her in the elevator a\nfew hours earlier: my attention had\nmade a fool of himself.\n\nINT. ELEVATOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)\n\nAn elevator door opens to reveal the SMILING FACES OF\nLACERDA, THE BLONDE TV REPORTER AND HER CREW.\n\nDUKE and GONZO stagger in.\n\nLACERDA drops his smile.  He's standing beside the BLONDE TV\nREPORTER.  A trembling GONZO moonily turns his eyes onto her.\n\nBLONDE TV REPORTER\n(to Gonzo)\nYou must be a rider.  What class\nare you in?\n\nGONZO\nClass?  What the fuck do you mean?\n\nBLONDE TV REPORTER\nWhat do you ride?  We're filming\nthe race for a TV series -- maybe\nwe can use you.\n\nGONZO\nUse me?\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMother of God, I thought.  Here it\ncomes.\n\nGONZO is TREMBLING BADLY.  There's a moment of uncomfortable\nsilence.\n\n42.\n\n\nGONZO\n(suddenly shouting)\nI ride the BIG ONES!  The really\nBIG fuckers!\n\nGONZO shows his teeth to LACERDA.  DUKE laughs trying to\ndefuse the scene.\n\nDUKE\nThe Vincent Black Shadow.  We're\nwith the Factory Team.\n\nTV CAMERAMAN\nBullshit.\n\nGONZO stills -- becomes dangerous -- zeros in on the TV\nCAMERAMAN -- groin to groin...\n\nGONZO\nWait a minute, pardon me lady, but\nI think there's some kind of\nignorant chicken-sucker in this car\nwho needs his face cut open.  You\ncheap honky faggots!  Which one of\nyou wants to get cut?!\n\nDEAD SILENCE.\n\nDing!  The elevator door opens, but nobody moves.  The door\ncloses.\n\nNext floor.  Ding!  The door opens again.

Did\nyou put him on to her?\n\nDUKE\n(backing slowly\ntowards the door)\nLook you better put that blade away\nand get your head straight.  I have\nto put the car in the lot.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOne of the things you learn, after\nyears of dealing with drug people,\nis that you can turn your back on a\nperson, but never turn your back on\na drug.  Especially when it's\nwaving a razor-sharp hunting knife\nin your eyes.\n\nINT. CASINO/LOBBY MINT HOTEL\n\nThe MAGAZINE REPORTER is on the telephone.\n\nMAGAZINE REPORTER\nLas Vegas at dawn.  The racers are\nstill asleep, the dust is still on\nthe desert, fifty thousand dollars\nin prize money, slumbers darkly in\nthe office safe at Del Webb's\nfabulous Mint Hotel...\n\nDUKE walks past the REPORTER -- into THE CASINO, THE SAD,\nMEAGRE CROWDS AROUND THE CRAP TABLES.  No joy.  DUKE watches.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWho are these people?  These faces!\nWhere do they come from?  They look\nlike caricatures of used car\ndealers from Dallas.\n(MORE)\n\n44.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O; CONT'D)\nAnd, sweet Jesus, there are a hell\nof a lot of them at four-thirty on\na Monday morning.  Still humping\nthe American dream, that vision of\nthe big winner somehow emerging\nfrom the last minute predawn chaos\nof a stale Vegas casino.\n\nDUKE stops at the Money Wheel, puts down a two dollar bill\non a number, the wheel turns, he loses.\n\nDUKE\nYou bastards!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNo.  Calm down.  Learn to ENJOY\nlosing.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE walks back into the room.  We hear the LOUD STRAINS OF\nTHREE DOG NIGHT'S \"JOY TO THE WORLD.\"\n\nHe walks to the bathroom and opens the door.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nSubmerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub.\nSoap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface.  A\nlarge empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor.  The\nshower is on -- the tub overflowing.  THE TAPE RECORDER\nPLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over\nthe sink.\n\nDUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED\nUP WHITE BLOTTER.\n\nDUKE\nYou ate ALL THIS ACID?\n\nNo answer.\n\nDUKE\n(turning down the volume)\nYou evil son of a bitch.  You\nbetter hope there's some Thorazine\nin that bag, because if there's\nnot, you're in bad trouble.\n\nGONZO\nMusic!  Turn it up.  Put that tape\non.\n\n45.\n\n\nDUKE\nWhat tape?\n\nGONZO\nJefferson Airplane. \"White Rabbit.\"\nI want a rising sound.\n\nDUKE\nYou're doomed.  I'm leaving here in\ntwo hours and then they're going to\ncome up here and beat the mortal\nshit out of you with big saps.\nRight there in that tub.\n\nGONZO\nI dig my own graves.  Green water\nand the White Rabbit.  Put it on.\n\nDUKE\nOK.  But do me one last favor, will\nyou.  Can you give me two hours?\nThat's all I ask -- just two hours\nto sleep before tomorrow.  I\nsuspect it's going to be a very\ndifficult day.\n\nHe switches on the tape. \"WHITE RABBIT\" begins to build.\n\nGONZO\n(coolly)\nOf course, I'm your attorney, I'll\ngive you all the time you need, at\nmy normal rates: $45 an hour -- but\nyou'll be wanting a cushion, so,\nwhy don't you just lay one of those\n$100 bills down there beside the\nradio, and fuck off?\n\nDUKE\nHow about a check?\n\nGONZO\nWhatever's right.\n\nDUKE moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and\nleaves, closing the door behind him.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE goes across to the sofa and crashes -- exhausted.\nSuddenly a great ripping and crashing noise in the bathroom.\n\nGONZO (V/O)\nHelp!  You bastard!  I need help!\n\n46.\n\n\nDUKE JUMPS up -- crosses to the bathroom door, muttering.\n\nDUKE\nShit, he's killing himself!\n\nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nDUKE RUSHES IN.  GONZO flails -- trying to reach the radio\nwith the shower curtain pole which he has ripped from its\nmounts.\n\nGONZO\n(snarling)\nI want that fucking radio!\n\nDUKE GRABS THE RADIO.\n\nDUKE\nDon't touch it!  Get back in that\ntub!\n\nGONZO\nBack the tape up.  I need it again!\nLet it roll!  Just as high as the\nfucker can go!  And when it comes\nto that fantastic note where the\nrabbit bites its own head off, I\nwant you to THROW THAT FUCKING\nRADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!\n\nDUKE stares down at GONZO.\n\nDUKE\nNot me.  It would blast you through\nthe wall -- stone dead in ten\nseconds and they'd make me explain\nit!\n\nGONZO\nBULLSHIT!  Don't make me use this.\n\nHIS ARM LASHES OUT OF THE WATER, HOLDING THE KNIFE.\n\nDUKE\nJesus.\n\nGONZO\nDo it!  I want to get HIGHER!\n\nDUKE considers this.  He's had enough.\n\n47.\n\n\nDUKE\nOkay.  You're right.  This is\nprobably the only solution.\n(holds the PLUGGED IN\nTAPE/RADIO over the tub)\nLet me make sure I have it all\nlined up.  You want me to throw\nthis thing into the tub when \"WHITE\nRABBIT\" peaks.  Is that it?\n\nGONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.\n\nGONZO\nFuck yes.  I was beginning to think\nI was going to have to go out and\nget one of the goddamn maids to do\nit.\n\nDUKE\nAre you ready?\n\nHe switches \"WHITE RABBIT\" back on.  GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS\nAND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.\n\nMeanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a\ngood two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when \"WHITE\nRABBIT\" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.\n\nGONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A\nTIDAL WAVE.\n\nDUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF\nTHE BATHROOM.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE slumps onto the sofa.\n\nSILENCE.\n\nGONZO RIPS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR, his eyes unfocused.  HE\nWAVES THE RAZOR SHARP BLADE out in front of him -- LUNGES at\nDUKE.  DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE.\n\nDUKE\nMACE!  YOU WANT THIS?\n\nGONZO stops -- hisses.\n\nGONZO\nYou bastard!  You'd do that,\nwouldn't you?\n\n48.\n\n\nDUKE\n(laughs)\nWhy worry?  You'll like it.  Nothing\nin the world like a Mace high.\nForty-five minutes on your knees\nwith the dry heaves...\n\nGONZO\nYou cheap honky sonofabitch...\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  Hell, just a minute ago,\nyou were asking me to kill you!\nAnd now you want to kill me!  What\nI should do, goddamnit, is call the\npolice!\n\nGONZO\nThe cops?\n\nDUKE\nThere's no choice.  I wouldn't dare\ngo to sleep with you wandering\naround with a head full of acid and\nwanting to slice me up with that\ngoddamn knife!\n\nGONZO\n(mumbles)\nWho said anything about slicing you\nup?  I just wanted to carve a\nlittle Z on your forehead.  Nothing\nserious.\n\nGONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.\n\nDUKE\n(menaces him with the MACE)\nGet back in that tub.  Eat some\nreds and try to calm down.  Smoke\nsome grass, shoot some smack --\nshit, do whatever you have to do,\nbut let me get some rest.\n\nGONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.\n\nGONZO\nHell, yes.  You really need some\nsleep.  You have to work.  Goddamn.\nWhat a bummer.  Try to rest.  Don't\nlet me keep you up.\n\n49.\n\n\nGONZO shuffles back into the bathroom.  DUKE wedges a chair\nup against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next\nto the clock.\n\nDUKE turns on the TV.  WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  He\ncollapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIgnore the nightmare in the bathroom.\nJust another ugly refugee from the\nLove Generation.\n\nThe WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his\nface.  The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL\nBEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy attorney had never been able to\naccept the notion -- often espoused\nby former drug abusers -- that you\ncan get a lot higher without drugs\nthan with them.  And neither have\nI, for that matter.\n\nThe pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL\nLIGHTSHOW PATTERN.  With DUKE still sitting in the\nforeground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior\nof A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.\n\nINT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT\n\nA slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng.  All the\naction is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI recall one night in the Matrix.\nThere I was -- a victim of the Drug\nExplosion.  A natural street freak,\njust eating whatever came by.\n\nA ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting.  The\nsound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.\n\nROAD-PERSON\nAnybody want some L...S...D...?  I\ngot all the makin's right here.\nAll I need is a place to cook.\n\nThe camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth.\n\nINT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nStill in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a\nHUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty.\n\n50.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI decided to eat only half at first.\nGood thinking.  But I spilled the\nrest on the sleeve of my red\nPendleton shirt.\n\nDUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the\ndoor to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in\nslow-motion.\n\nMUSICIAN\nWhat's the trouble?\n\nDUKE\n(also in slow-motion)\nWell, all this white stuff on my\nsleeve is LSD.\n\nThe MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A\nlong pause.\n\nCut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-\ncut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.\nWe cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the\nmen's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...\nsucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The\nSTOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWith a bit of luck his life was\nruined -- forever thinking that\njust behind some narrow door in all\nhis favorite bars, men in red\nPendleton shirts are getting\nincredible kicks from things he'll\nnever know.\n\nINT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT\n\nThe STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking\nlost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a\nTV white noise snowstorm.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE sits staring at the TV.\n\n51.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nStrange memories on this nervous\nnight in Las Vegas.\n(he gets up, pours\nhimself a drink)\nHas it been five years?  Six?  It\nseems like a lifetime -- the kind\nof peak that never comes again.\nSan Francisco in the middle sixties\nwas a very special time and place\nto be a part of.  But no\nexplanation, no mix of words or\nmusic or memories can touch that\nsense of knowing that you were\nthere and alive in that corner of\ntime and the world.  Whatever it\nmeant.\n\nDUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in.\n\nEXT. 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE\n\nWe are in SAN FRANCISCO.  IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nTHERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION,\nAT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE\nSPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A\nFANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT\nWHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,\nTHAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I\nTHINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE\nOF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE\nFORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY\nMEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T\nNEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY\nprevail.  We had all the momentum;\nwe were riding the crest of a high\nand beautiful wave...\n\nDUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE\nNEVER SEEN BEFORE.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nSo now, less than five years later,\nyou can go up on a steep hill in\nLas Vegas and look west, and with\nthe right kind of eyes you can\nalmost see the high water mark --\nthat place where the wave finally\nbroke and rolled back.\n\n52.\n\n\nThe memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.\nSuddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi\nshouting \"WOODSTOCK \u00dcBER ALLES!\"\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN\n\nA harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking\nlike shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe decision to flee came suddenly.\nOr maybe not.\n\nDUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of\nfruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.\n\nBELL BOY\nRoom service!\n\nThe BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already\nstacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMaybe I'd planned it all along --\nsubconsciously waiting for the\nright moment.  The bill was a\nfactor, I think.  Because I had no\nmoney to pay for it.\n\nDUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur room service tabs had been\nrunning somewhere between $29 and\n$36 per hour, for forty-eight\nconsecutive hours.  Incredible.\nHow could it happen?\n\nDUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED\nLUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room --\nempty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut by the time I asked this\nquestion, there was no one around\nto answer.\n\nDUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.\n\n53.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy attorney was gone.  He must have\nsensed trouble.\n\nQUICK CUT TO:\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY\n\nGONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of\nbrand-new fine cowhide luggage.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nPanic.\n\nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase --\nleaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both\nways, then hurries away down the corridor.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt crept up my spine like first\nrising vibes of an acid frenzy.\nAll these horrible realities began\nto dawn on me.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY\n\nAn anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the\nelevator descends.  He searches his pockets...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHere I was, alone in Las Vegas,\nwith this goddamned incredibly\nexpensive car, completely twisted\non drugs, no cash, no story for the\nmagazine.  And on top of everything\nelse I had a gigantic goddamn hotel\nbill to deal with.\n\nDUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.\n\nThe door opens.  A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN\nHANDCUFFS.\n\nDUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner.  Doors\nclose.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI didn't even know who had won the\nrace.  Maybe nobody.\n\n54.\n\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\nDUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering\nMANAGER.  Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.\n\nDUKE\n(muttering to himself)\nHow would Horatio Alger have\nhandled this situation?\n\nEXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY\n\nMotoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN\nwith a smile.  The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves\nat the CAR BOY.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nStay calm.  Stay calm.  I'm a\nrelatively respectable citizen -- a\nmultiple felon, perhaps, but\ncertainly not dangerous.\n\nThe CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.  DUKE jumps in.  The\nback seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint\n400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\nLuckily, I had taken the soap and\ngrapefruit and other luggage out to\nthe car a few hours earlier.  Now\nit was only a matter of slipping\nthe noose...\n\nDUKE shifts into drive.  Deliverance!\n\nCLERK'S VOICE\nMR. DUKE!\n\nDUKE freezes.\n\nCLERK'S VOICE\nMr. Duke!  We've been looking for\nyou!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe game was up!  They had me.\n\nDUKE\n(to himself)\nWell, why not?  Many fine books\nhave been written in prison.\n\n55.\n\n\nResigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.  A young CLERK\narrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS\nHAND.\n\nCLERK\nSir?\n(thrusts out a TELEGRAM)\nThis telegram came for you.\nActually, it isn't for you.  It's\nfor somebody named Thompson, but it\nsays 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does\nthat make sense?\n\nDUKE\n(barely able to speak)\nYes... It makes sense.\n\nDUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.\n\nThe CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous\nstash inside.\n\nCLERK\nI checked the register for this man\nThompson.  We don't show him but I\nfigured he might be part of your\nteam.\n\nDUKE\nHe is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to\nhim.\n\nHe fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.\n\nSECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word\nor two.\n\nCLERK\nWhat confused us was Dr. Gonzo's\nsignature on the telegram from Los\nAngeles.  When we knew he was right\nhere in the hotel.\n\nDUKE\nYou did the right thing.  Never try\nto understand a press message.\nAbout half the time we use codes --\nespecially with Dr. Gonzo.\n\nCLERK\nTell me.  When will the doctor be\nawake?\n\n56.\n\n\nDUKE\n(tenses)\nAwake?  What do you mean?\n\nDUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.\n\nCLERK\n(uncomfortably)\nWell... the manager, Mr. Heem,\nwould like to meet him.  Nothing\nunusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet\nall our large accounts... put them\non a personal basis... just a chat\nand a handshake, you understand.\n\nDUKE\nOf course.  But if I were you, I'd\nleave the Doctor alone until after\nhe's eaten breakfast.  He's a very\ncrude man.\n\nDUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.\n\nCLERK\nBut he will be available?  Perhaps\nlater this morning?\n\nDUKE\nLook.  That telegram was all\nscrambled.  It was actually from\nThompson, not to him.  Western\nUnion must have gotten the names\nreversed.  I have to get going.  I\nhave to get out to the track.\n\nCLERK\nThere's no hurry!  The race is over!\n\nDUKE\n(taking off)\nNot for me.\n\nHe waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.\n\nCLERK\nLet's have lunch!\n\nDUKE\nRighto!\n\nEXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY\n\nDUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.\n\n57.\n\n\nA \"YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS\" sign flashes past.\n\nBob Dylan plays: \"Memphis Blues Again -- \"Aaww, Mama, can\nthis really by the end...?\"\n\nA sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nJesus, bad waves of paranoia,\nmadness, fear and loathing --\nintolerable vibrations in this\nplace.  Get out!  The weasels were\nclosing in.  I could smell the ugly\nbrutes.  Flee!\n\nDUKE drives fast.\n\nDUKE\nDo me one last favor Lord: just\ngive me five more high-speed hours\nbefore you bring the hammer down;\njust let me get rid of this goddamn\ncar and off of this horrible desert.\n\nA sign flashes \"YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.\"\n\nA patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nYou evil bastard!  This is your\nwork!  You'd better take care of\nme, Lord... because if you don't\nyou're going to have me on your\nhands.\n\nThe patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nFew people understand the psychology\nof dealing with a Highway Traffic\nCop.  Your normal speeder will\npanic and immediately pull over to\nthe side.  This is wrong.\n\nDUKE floors the gas pedal.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt arouses contempt in the cop heart.\n\nTHE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.\n\n58.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMake the bastard chase you.  He\nwill follow.  But he won't know\nwhat to make of your blinker signal\nthat says you're about to turn right.\n\nDUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThis is to let him know you're\nlooking for a proper place to pull\noff and talk.\n\nAN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.\n\nDUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt will take him a moment to\nrealize that he is about to make\n180 degree turn at speed... but you\nwill be ready for it, braced for\nthe G's and the fast heel toe work.\n\nThe patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.\n\nEXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY\n\nThe patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE\nstands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nJust what the FUCK did you think\nyou were doing?!\n\nDUKE smiles.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nMay I see your license.\n\nDUKE\nOf course, officer.\n\nDUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer\ncan -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI knew I was fucked.\n\nThe COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for\nDUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.\n\n59.\n\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nCould I have that, please?\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  It was getting warm anyway.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --\nglances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars\nof soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nYou realize...\n\nDUKE\nYeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I\nunderstand that.  I knew it was a\ncrime but I did it anyway.  Shit,\nwhy argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nThat's a strange attitude.\n\nHe looks at DUKE thoughtfully.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nYou know -- I get the feeling you\ncould use a nap.  There's a rest\narea up ahead.  Why don't you pull\nover and sleep a few hours?\n\nDUKE\nA nap won't help.  I've been awake\nfor too long -- three or four\nnights.  I can't even remember.  If\nI go to sleep now, I'm dead for\ntwenty hours.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nOkay.  Here's how it is.  What goes\ninto my book, as of noon, is that I\napprehended you... for driving too\nfast, and advised you to proceed no\nfurther than the next rest area...\nyour stated destination, right?\nWhere you plan to take a long nap.\nDo I make myself clear?\n\nDUKE\nHow far is Baker?  I was hoping to\nstop there for lunch.\n\n60.\n\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nNot my jurisdiction.  The city\nlimits are two point two miles\nbeyond the rest area.  Can you make\nit that far?\n\nDUKE\nI'll try.  I've been wanting to go\nto Baker for a long time.  I've\nheard a lot about it.\n\nThe PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nExcellent seafood.  With a mind\nlike yours, you'll probably want to\ntry the land-crab.  Try the Majestic\nDiner.\n\nThe PATROLMAN slams the door shut.\n\nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY\n\nDUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI felt raped.  The Pig had done me\non all fronts, and now he was going\noff to chuckle about it -- on the\nwest side of town, waiting for me\nto make a run for L.A.\n\nDUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he\nsignals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn\nhe sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn\ntheir eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER\ndrops his thumb.\n\nDUKE\nGreat Jesus, it's him.\n\nDUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE\nWAY HE CAME.\n\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.\n\nDUKE\nThey've nailed me!  I'm trapped in\nsome stinking desert crossroads\ncalled Baker.  I don't have much\ntime.  The fuckers are closing in.\nThey'll hunt me down like a beast!\n\n61.\n\n\nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nGONZO sits surrounded by legal papers and law books.  Mexican\nDay of the Dead masks hang from the walls -- flame-red demons.\n\nGONZO\nWho?  You sound a little paranoid.\n\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE screams -- sweat pouring.\n\nDUKE\nYou bastard!  I need a lawyer\nimmediately!\n\nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nGONZO\nWhat are you doing in Baker?\nDidn't you get my telegram?\n\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE\nWhat?  Fuck telegrams.  I'm in\ntrouble.  You worthless bastard.\nI'll cripple your ass for this!\nAll that shit in the car is yours!\nYou understand that?  When I finish\ntestifying out here you'll be\ndisbarred!\n\nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nGONZO\nYou're supposed to be in Vegas.  We\nhave a suite at the Flamingo.  I\nwas just about to leave for the\nairport.\n\nINT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE pulls out the telegram from his top pocket.\n\nGONZO'S VOICE\nYou brainless scumbag!  You're\nsupposed to be covering the National\nDistrict Attorney's conference!  I\nmade all the reservations... rented\na white Cadillac convertible... the\nwhole thing is arranged!  What the\nhell are you doing out there in the\nmiddle of the fucking desert?\n\n62.\n\n\nDUKE stares at the telegram.\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  It's all a big joke.\nI'm actually sitting beside the\npool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking\nfrom a portable phone.  Some dwarf\nbrought it out from the casino.  I\nhave total credit!  Can you grasp\nthat?\n(shouts)\nDon't come anywhere near this place!\nForeigners aren't welcome here!\n\nDUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone.\n\nEXT. DESERT - DAY\n\nC/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWell.  This is how the world works.\n\nC/U An IGUANA basks in the sun.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nAll energy flows according to the\nwhims of the Great Magnet.\n\nC/U Barrel of the gun.  It fires.  An explosion of desert\ndirt.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhat a fool I was to defy Him.\n\nThe IGUANA sits unfazed.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNever cross the Great Magnet.  I\nunderstood this now...\n(another blast from\nthe gun)\n... and with understanding came a\nsense of almost terminal relief.\n\nDUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the\nthuds of the explosions echo away.\n\nEXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY\n\nThe RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.\n\n63.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI had to get rid of The Shark.  Too\nmany people might recognize it...\n...especially the Vegas Police.\n(tight C/U of DUKE)\nLuckily, my credit card was still\ntechnically valid.\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL:\n\nDUKE, now driving a white Cadillac Coupe de Ville -- THE\nWHITE WHALE.\n\nDUKE pushes buttons -- lowers the top.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThis was a superior machine -- ten\ngrand worth of gimmicks and high\nprice special effects.  The rear\nwindows leapt up with a touch like\nfrogs in a dynamited pond.  The\ndashboard was full of esoteric\nlights and dials and meters that I\nwould never understand.\n\nEXT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - AFTERNOON\n\nA GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S\nCONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIf the Pigs were gathering in\nVegas, I felt the Drug Culture\nshould be represented as well...\nand there was a certain bent appeal\nin the notion of running a savage\nburn on one Las Vegas hotel and\nthen just wheeling across town and\nchecking into another.\n\nThe WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately\nattended by impressed MINIONS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMe and a thousand ranking cops from\nall over America.  Why not?  Move\nconfidently into their midst.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON\n\nDUKE enters -- old Levis, grubby sneakers, 10 peso Acapulco\nshirt coming apart at the seams, 3 day growth, eyes hidden\nbehind mirror shades.  He heads for the check-in line.\n\n64.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy arrival was badly timed.\n\nTHE PLACE IS FULL OF COPS.  200 of them, on vacation, all\ndressed in cut price Vegas casuals: plaid Bermuda shorts,\nArnie Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals.\n\nAhead of DUKE -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK.\nThe POLICE CHIEF'S AGNEW STYLE WIFE stands to the side,\nweeping.  The POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around.\n\nPOLICE CHIEF\nWhat do you mean I'm too late to\nregister?  I'm a police chief.\nFrom Michigan.  Look, fella, I told\nyou.\n(waves a POSTCARD)\nI have a postcard here that says I\nhave reservations in this hotel.\n\nCLERK\n(prissily)\nI'm sorry, sir.  You're on the\n\"late list.\" Your reservations were\ntransferred to the... ah...\nMoonlight Motel, which is out on\nParadise Boulevard...\n\nPOLICE CHIEF\nI've already paid for my goddamn\nroom!\n\nCLERK\nIt's actually a very fine place of\nlodging and only sixteen blocks\nfrom here, with its own pool and...\n\nPOLICE CHIEF\nYou dirty little faggot!  Call the\nmanager!  I'm tired of listening to\nthis dogshit!\n\nFRIENDS restrain the POLICE CHIEF.\n\nCLERK\n(solicitously)\nI'm so sorry, sir.  May I call you\na cab?\n\nThe POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOf course, I could hear what the\nClerk was really saying...\n\n65.\n\n\nCLERK\n(IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION)\nListen, you fuzzy little shithead --\nI've been fucked around, in my\ntime, by a fairly good cross-\nsection of mean-tempered rule-crazy\ncops and now it's MY turn. \"Fuck\nyou, officer, I'm in charge here,\nand I'm telling you we don't have\nroom for you.\"\n\nDUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.\n\nDUKE\nSay.  I hate to interrupt, but I\nwonder if maybe I could just sort\nof slide through and get out of\nyour way.  Name's Raoul Duke --\nRaoul Duke.  My attorney made the\nreservation.\n\nDUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE\ngoes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he\nwas some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The\nCLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.\n\nCLERK\nCertainly, Mr. Duke!\n\nDUKE\nMy bags are out there in that white\nCadillac convertible.  Can you have\nsomeone drive it around to the room?\n\nALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.\n\nDUKE\nOh, and could I get a quart of Wild\nTurkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and\na night's worth of ice delivered to\nmy room, please?\n\nCLERK\nDon't worry about a thing, sir.\nJust enjoy your stay.\n\nDUKE\nWell, thank you.\n\nDUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the\nelevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of\nbeer and toasts them.  The doors close.\n\n66.\n\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE rams the key home -- swings the door open.\n\nDUKE\nAh, home at last!\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON\n\nDUKE enters.  The door hits something with a thud.\n\nA 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull.\n\nGONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a\ndrug-addled grin on his face.\n\nDUKE\nYou degenerate pig!\n\nGONZO\nIt can't be helped.  This is Lucy.\n(laughing distractedly)\nYou know--like \"Lucy In The Sky\nWith Diamonds.\"\n\nLUCY eyes DUKE venomously.\n\nGONZO\nLucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit!\nRemember what happened at the\nairport!  No more of that, okay?\n\nLUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his\narm round her shoulder.\n\nGONZO\nLucy... this is my client.  This is\nMr. Duke, the famous journalist.\nHe's paying for this suite, Lucy.\nHe's on our side.\n\nDUKE flops onto the sofa.\n\nGONZO\nMr. Duke is my friend.  He loves\nartists.\n\nDUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of\nartwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in\ncharcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.\n\nGONZO\nLucy paints portraits of Barbra\nStreisand.\n\n67.\n\n\nLUCY\nI drew these from TV.\n\nGONZO\nFantastic.  She came all the way\ndown here from Montana just to give\nthese portraits to Barbra.  We're\ngoing over to the Americana Hotel\ntonight to meet her backstage...\n\nDUKE's voice rises above GONZO.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI desperately needed peace, rest,\nsanctuary.  I hadn't counted on\nthis.  Finding my attorney on acid\nand locked into some kind of\npreternatural courtship.\n\nDUKE\nWell, I guess they brought the car\nround by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF\nOUT OF THE TRUNK.\n\nDUKE fixes GONZO hard.\n\nGONZO\nAbsolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF.\n(to LUCY)\nNow, we'll be right back.  Don't\nanswer the phone if it rings.\n\nLUCY\n(makes one-fingered\nJesus freak sign)\nGod bless.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE collars GONZO -- serious.\n\nDUKE\nWELL?  What are your plans?\n\nGONZO\nPlans?\n\nDUKE\nLucy.\n\n68.\n\n\nGONZO\n(struggling to focus)\nShit.  I met her on the plane and I\nhad all that acid.\n(he shrugs)\nYou know, those little blue barrels.\nI gave her a cap before I realized...\nshe's a religious freak... Jesus,\nshe's never even had a drink.\n\nDUKE\nWell... It'll probably work out.\nWe can keep her loaded and peddle\nher ass at the drug convention.\n\nGONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.\n\nGONZO\nListen, she's running away from\nhome for something like the fifth\ntime in six months.  It's terrible.\n\nDUKE\nShe's perfect for this gig.  These\ncops will go fifty bucks a head to\nbeat her into submission and then\ngang fuck her.  We can set her up\nin one of these back street motels,\nhang pictures of Jesus all over the\nroom, then turn these pigs loose on\nher... Hell she's strong; she'll\nhold her own.\n\nGONZO's face twitches badly.\n\nGONZO\nJesus Christ.  I knew you were sick\nbut I never expected to hear you\nactually say that kind of stuff.\n\nDUKE\nIt's straight economics.  This girl\nis a god-send.  Shit, she can make\nus a grand a day.\n\nGONZO\nNO!  Stop talking like that.\n\nDUKE\nI figure she can do about four at a\ntime.  Christ, if we keep her full\nof acid that's more like two grand\na day.  Maybe three.\n\n69.\n\n\nGONZO\nYou filthy bastard.  I should cave\nyour fucking head in.\n\nDUKE\nIn a few hours, she'll probably be\nsane enough to work herself into a\ntowering Jesus-based rage at the\nhazy recollection of being seduced\nby some kind of cruel Samoan who\nfed her liquor and LSD, dragged her\nto a Vegas hotel room and savagely\npenetrated every orifice in her\nbody with his throbbing,\nuncircumcised member.\n\nGONZO starts crying.\n\nGONZO\nNO!  I felt sorry for the girl, I\nwanted to help her!\n\nDUKE\nYou'll go straight to the gas\nchamber.  And even if you manage to\nbeat that, they'll send you back to\nNevada for Rape and Consensual\nSodomy.  She's got to go.\n\nPause.\n\nGONZO\nShit, it doesn't pay to try to help\nsomebody these days.\n\nA silence.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe only alternative was to take\nher out to the desert and feed her\nremains to the lizards.  But, it\nseemed a bit heavy for the thing we\nwere trying to protect: My attorney.\n\nGONZO\nWe have to cut her loose.  She's\ngot two hundred dollars.  And we\ncan always call the cops up there\nin Montana, where she lives, and\nturn her in.\n\nDUKE\nWhat?... What kind of goddamn\nmonster are you?\n\n70.\n\n\nGONZO\nIt just occurred to me, that she\nhas no witnesses.  Anything that\nshe says about us is completely\nworthless.\n\nDUKE\nUs?\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET\n\nDUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.\n\nDUKE\nHotel Americana?  I need a\nreservation.  For my niece.  Listen,\nI need her treated very gently.\nShe's an artist, and might seem a\ntrifle highstrung...\n\nIn the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the\ndoor.\n\nGONZO\nOkay, Lucy, it's time to go meet\nBarbra...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI felt like a Nazi, but it had to\nbe done.\n\nEXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK\n\nThe WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps\nLUCY and her paintings from the car.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nLucy was a potentially fatal\nmillstone on both our necks.  There\nwas absolutely no choice but to cut\nher adrift and hope her memory was\nfucked.\n\nGONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --\nwaves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting\nto come down...\n\nGONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands\ntogether as if washing his hands of the situation.\n\nGONZO\nWell that's that.  Take off slowly.\nDon't attract attention.\n\n71.\n\n\nThey pull out into traffic.\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK\n\nGONZO\nI gave the cabbie an extra ten\nbucks to make sure she gets there\nsafe.  Also, I told him I'd be\nthere myself in an hour, and if she\nwasn't, I'd come back out here and\nrip his lungs out.\n\nDUKE\nThat's good.  You can't be subtle\nin this town.\n\nGONZO\nAs your attorney, I advise you to\ntell me where you put the goddamn\nmescaline.\n\nDUKE\nMaybe we should take it easy tonight.\n\nGONZO\nRight.  Let's find a good seafood\nrestaurant and eat some red salmon.\nI feel a powerful lust for red\nsalmon...\n\nThe electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The\nsun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson\ntune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING\n\nGONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.\n\nIn the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him.\n\nDUKE\nCome on, we're going to be late.\n\nGONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth\nwith a towel.\n\nGONZO\nThis goddamn mescaline.  Why the\nfuck can't they make it a little\nless pure?  Maybe mix it up with\nRolaids or something.\n\n72.\n\n\nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n(crackling and\nbooming over the\nlousy sound system)\nOn behalf of the prosecuting\nattorneys of this county, I welcome\nyou to the Third National DA's\nConference on Narcotics and\nDangerous Drugs.\n\nThe EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman\ntype -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads:\nNATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. \"If You Don't Know, Come To\nLearn... If You Know, Come To Teach.\"\n\nA BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS\nAND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod\ndress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be\nWITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around\n20 REDNECKS.\n\nA dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles\ndistort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.\n\nAt the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI\nwingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name\ntag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.\n\nGONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT,\nCRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge.\n\nGONZO\n(lowers his voice)\nI saw these bastards in Easy Rider,\nbut I didn't believe they were real.\nNot like this.  Not hundreds of them!\n\nDUKE\nThey're actually nice people when\nyou get to know them.\n\nGONZO\nMan, I know these people in my\ngoddamn blood!\n\nDUKE\nDon't mention that word around here.\nYou'll get them excited.\n\nGONZO\nThis is a fucking nightmare.\n\n73.\n\n\nDUKE\nRight.  Sure as hell some dope-\ndealing bomb freak is going to\nrecognize you and put the word out\nthat you're partying with a thousand\ncops.\n\nCOP IN BACK\nSSSSHHH!\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST -- a \"drug expert\" -- takes the stage.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nWe must come to terms with the Drug\nCulture in the country... country...\ncountry...\n\nThe sound systems echoes.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)\nThe reefer butt is called a \"roach,\"\nbecause it resembles a cockroach...\ncockroach... cockroach...\n\nGONZO\n(whispers)\nWhat the fuck are these people\ntalking about?  You'd have to be\ncrazy on acid to think a joint\nlooked like a goddamn cockroach!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt was clear that we had stumbled\ninto a prehistoric gathering.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nNow, there are four states of being\nin the cannabis, or marijuana,\nsociety: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and\nSquare.  The square is seldom if\never cool.  He is not \"with it,\"\nthat is, he doesn't know \"what's\nhappening.\" But if he manages to\nfigure it out, he moves up a notch\nto \"hip.\"\n\nDUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)\nAnd if he can bring himself to\napprove of what is happening, he\nbecomes \"groovy.\" After that, with\nmuch luck and perseverance, he can\nrise to the rank of \"cool.\" A cool\nguy... cool guy... cool guy...\n\n74.\n\n\nCOP IN BACK\nDr. Bloomquist, do you think the\nanthropologist, Margaret Mead's\nstrange behavior of late might\npossibly be explained by a private\nmarijuana addiction?\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nI really don't know, but at her\nage, if she did smoke grass, she'd\nhave one hell of a trip!\n\nRoars of laughter.\n\nGONZO\nI know a hell of a lot better ways\nto waste my time than listening to\nthis bullshit.\n\nHe stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and\nplunges down the aisle to the door.\n\nCOP IN BACK\nDown in front!\n\nGONZO\nFuck you!  I have to get out!  I\ndon't belong here!\n\nCOP IN BACK\nGood riddance!\n\nHe stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to\nthe stage.\n\nThe lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER\nMADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nKNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE\nMAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be\nable to see his eyes because of\nTea-Shades, but his knuckles will\nbe white from inner tension...\n\nDUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF\nwho necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\n... and his pants will be crusted\nwith semen from constantly jacking\noff when he can't find a rape\nvictim...\n\n75.\n\n\nDUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness,\nhe gets up, hand over mouth.\n\nDUKE\nPardon me, I feel sick.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nHe will stagger and babble when\nquestioned.  He will not respect\nyour badge.  The Dope Fiend fears\nnothing.  He will attack, for no\nreason, with every weapon at his\ncommand -- including yours...\n\nDUKE heads for the exit.\n\nDUKE\nSorry, sick... Beg pardon!  Feeling\nsick...\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nBEWARE.  Any officer apprehending a\nsuspected marijuana addict should\nuse all necessary force immediately.\nOne stitch in time [on him] will\nusually save nine on you.\n\nDUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.\n\nINT. CASINO BAR - DAY\n\nDUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING\nCOP about 40 whose name tag identifies him as a DISTRICT\nATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA.\n\nDA\nI'm a whiskey man myself.  We don't\nhave much trouble from drugs where\nI come from...\n\nGONZO\nYou will.  One of these nights\nyou'll wake up and find a junkie\ntearing your bedroom apart.\n\nDA\nNaw!\n\nGONZO\nThey'll climb right into your\nbedroom and sit on your chest with\nbig Bowie knives.  They might even\nsit on your wife's chest.  Put the\nblade right down on her throat.\n\n76.\n\n\nDA\nNot down in my parts.\n\nDUKE joins them.\n\nDUKE\n(to WAITRESS)\nRum and ice, please.\n\nDA\n(looks at DUKE'S NAME TAG)\nYou're another one of these\nCalifornia boys.  Your friend\nhere's been tellin' us about dope\nfiends.\n\nDUKE\nThey're everywhere.  Nobody's safe.\nAnd sure as hell not in the South.\nThey like warm weather... You'd\nnever believe it.  In L.A. it's out\nof control.  First it was drugs,\nnow it's witchcraft.\n\nDA\nWitchcraft?  Shit, you can't mean it!\n\nThe BARTENDER cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the\nconversation.\n\nGONZO\nRead the newspapers.\n\nDUKE\nMan, you don't know trouble until\nyou have to face down a bunch of\nthese addicts gone crazy for human\nsacrifice!\n\nDA\nNaw!  That's science fiction stuff!\n\nDUKE\nNot where we operate.\n\nGONZO\nHell, in Malibu alone, these\ngoddamn Satan worshippers kill six\nor eight people every day.  All\nthey want is the blood.  They'll\ntake people right off the street if\nthey have to.\n\n77.\n\n\nDUKE\nJust the other day we had a case\nwhere they grabbed a girl right out\nof a McDonald's hamburger stand.\nShe was a waitress, about sixteen\nyears old... with a lot of people\nwatching, too!\n\nThe BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more\nfuriously.\n\nDA\nWhat happened?  What did they do to\nher?\n\nGONZO\nDo?  Jesus Christ, man.  They\nchopped her goddamn head off right\nthere in the parking lot!  Then\nthey cut all kinds of holes in her\nhead and sucked out the blood!\n\nDA\n(DA ad-libs a\nsummation of the crime)\nAnd nobody did anything?\n\nDUKE\nWhat could they do?  The guy that\ntook the head was about six-seven,\nand maybe three-hundred pounds.  He\nwas packing two Lugers, and the\nothers had M-16s.\n\nGONZO\nThey just ran back out into Death\nValley -- you know, where Manson\nturned up...\n\nDUKE\nLike big lizards.\n\nGONZO\n... and every one of them stacked\nnaked...\n\nDA\nNaked!?\n\nDUKE\nNaked.\n\n78.\n\n\nGONZO\nYeh, naked!... except for the\nweapons.\n\nDUKE\nThey were all veterans.\n\nDA\nVeterans?!!!?\n\nAgog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes\nthe glass -- faster and faster...\n\nGONZO\nYeh.  The big guy used to be a\nmajor in the Marines.\n\nDA\nA major!\n\nGONZO\nWe know where he lives, but we\ncan't get near the house.\n\nDA\nNaw!  Not a major.\n\nGONZO\nHe wanted the pineal gland.\n\nDA\nReally?\n\nGONZO\nThat's how he got so big.  When he\nquit the Marines he was just a\nlittle guy.\n\nDUKE\nUsually, it's whole families.\nDuring the night.  Most of them\ndon't even wake up until they feel\ntheir heads going -- and then, of\ncourse, it's too late.\n\nThe glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nHappens every day.\n\nDUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile.\n\n79.\n\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nThree more rums.  Plenty of ice.\nMaybe a handful of lime chunks.\n\nWAITRESS\nAre you guys with the police\nconvention upstairs?\n\nDA\nWe sure are, Miss.\n\nWAITRESS\nI thought so.  I never heard that\nkind of talk around here before.\nJesus Christ!  How do you guys\nstand that kind of work?\n\nGONZO\n(grinning)\nWe like it.  It's groovy.\n\nThe WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO.\n\nDUKE\nWhat's wrong with you?  Hell,\nsomebody has to do it.\n\nGONZO\nHurry up with those drinks.  We're\nthirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine\na Bloody Mary.\n\nDA\n(whacks his fist on\nthe bar)\nHell, I really hate to hear this.\nBecause everything that happens in\nCalifornia seems to get down our\nway, sooner or later.  Mostly\nAtlanta.  But that was back when\nthe goddamn bastards were peaceful.\nAll we had to do was to keep 'em\nunder surveillance.  They didn't\nroam around much... But now Jesus,\nit seems nobody's safe.\n\nGONZO\n(with a conspiratorial\nnod)\nYou're going to need to take the\nbull by the horns -- go to the mat\nwith this scum.\n\n80.\n\n\nDA\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nGONZO\nYou know what I mean.  We've done\nit before and we can damn well do\nit again!\n\nDUKE\nCut their goddamn heads off.  Every\none of them.  That's what we're\ndoing in California.\n\nDA\n(stupefied)\nWHAT?\n\nGONZO\nSure.  It's all on the Q.T., but\neverybody who matters is with us\nall the way down the line.\n\nDUKE\nWe keep it quiet.  It's not the\nkind of thing you'd want to talk\nabout upstairs.  Not with the press\naround.\n\nDA\n(recovering slightly)\nHell, no.  We'd never hear the\ngoddamn end of it.\n\nDUKE\nDobermans don't talk.\n\nDA\nWhat?\n\nGONZO\nSometimes it's easier to just rip\nout the backstraps.\n\nDUKE\nThey'll fight like hell if you try\nto take the head without the dogs.\n\nDA\nGod almighty!\n(muttering in a daze)\nI don't think I should tell my wife\nabout this.

HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.\n\nGONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the\nbathroom.  Immediate sounds of retching.\n\nThe phone message light is blinking.  DUKE opens a beer,\npicks up the phone.\n\nDUKE\nWhat's the message?  My light is\nblinking.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nAh, yes.  Mr. Duke?  You have one\nmessage: \"Call Lucy at the Americana\nHotel, room 1600.\"\n\nDUKE\nHoly shit!\n\nDUKE slams the phone down.

What do you want?\n\nIn the background GONZO is upturning a sofa to retrieve his\nstash from the lining.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nThe woman who left that message for\nyou sounded very disturbed.  I\nthink she was crying...\n\nDUKE\nCrying?  Why was she crying?\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nWell, uh.  She didn't say Mr. Duke.\nBut since I know you're here with\nthe Police Convention...\n\nDUKE\nLook, you want to be gentle with\nthat woman if she ever calls again.\nWe're watching her very carefully...\nthis woman has been into laudanum.\nIt's a controlled experiment, but I\nsuspect we'll need your cooperation\nbefore this thing is over.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\n(hesitantly)\nWell, certainly... We're always\nhappy to cooperate with the police...\n\n83.\n\n\nDUKE\nDon't worry.

Yes... so, you'll be\nresponsible then?\n\nDUKE\nOf course.  And now I have to get\nback to the news.  Send up some ice.\n\nHe hangs up.  GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.\n\nGONZO\nGood work.

The\nonly way I could get rid of her was\nby saying you were taking me out to\nthe desert for a showdown -- that\nyou wanted me out of the way so you\ncould have her all to yourself.\n(laughing again)\nI guess she figures you won.

He finds a little bottle -- a\nlabel: \"DRINK ME.\"\n\nDUKE\nWhat is this?\n\n85.\n\n\nGONZO\nYou won't need much.  Just a little\ntiny taste, that stuff makes pure\nmescaline seem like ginger-beer.\nAdrenochrome.\n\nDUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.\n\nDUKE\nAdrenochrome...\n\nGONZO\n(into PHONE)\nHi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got\nyour message...what?  Hell, no, I\ntaught the bastard a lesson he'll\nnever forget... what?  No, not\ndead, but he won't be bothering\nanybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left\nhim out there, I stomped him, then\npulled all his teeth out...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember thinking, \"Jesus, what a\nterrible thing to lay on somebody\nwith a head full of acid.\"\n\nDUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies\nit -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...\n\nGONZO\n(to PHONE)\nBut here's the problem.  That\nbastard cashed a bad check\ndownstairs and gave you as a\nreference.  They'll be looking for\nboth of you.  Yeah, I know, but you\ncan't judge a book by its cover,\nLucy.  Some people are just\nbasically rotten... Anyway, the\nlast thing you want to do is call\nthis hotel again; they'll trace the\ncall and put you straight behind\nbars... no, I'm moving to the\nTropicana right away.  I have to\ngo, they've got the phone tapped.\nYeah, I know, it was horrible, but\nit's all over now... OH MY GOD!\nTHEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN!\n(throws the PHONE\ndown; shouts)\nNo!

I swear, I don't know where\nshe is!  DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME!\n(slams the PHONE down)\n\n\nGONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.\n\nGONZO\nWell.  That's that.  She's probably\nstuffing herself down the\nincinerator about now.  That's the\nlast we should be hearing from Lucy.\n(fumbling with the\nhash pipe)\nWhere's the opium?\n\nDUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY\nSTRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember slumping on the bed, his\nperformance had given me a bad jolt.\nFor a moment I thought his mind had\nsnapped -- that he actually believed\nhe was being attacked by invisible\nenemies.  But the room was quiet\nagain.\n\nDUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE.\n\nDUKE\nWhere'd you get this?\n\nGONZO\nNever mind, it's absolutely pure.\n\nDUKE\nJesus... what kind of monster\nclient have you picked up this time?\nThere's only one source for this\nstuff -- the adrenaline gland from\na living human body!\n\nGONZO turns to smile at DUKE.\n\n87.\n\n\nGONZO\nI know, but the guy didn't have any\ncash to pay me.  He's one of these\nSatanism freaks.  He offered me\nhuman blood -- said it would take\nme higher than I've ever been in my\nlife.\n(laughs -- struts\nround DUKE -- eyes\nbright with expectation)\nI thought he was kidding, so I told\nhim I'd just as soon have an ounce\nor so of pure adrenochrome -- or\nmaybe just a fresh adrenaline gland\nto chew on.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI could already feel the stuff\nworking on me -- the first wave\nfelt like a combination of mescaline\nand methedrine -- maybe I should\ntake a swim, I thought...\n\nDUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...\n\nGONZO\nYeah, they nailed this guy for\nchild molesting.  He swore he\ndidn't do it. \"Why should I fuck\nwith children?\" he says. \"They're\ntoo small.\" Christ, werewolf is\nentitled to legal counsel.  I\ndidn't dare turn the creep down.\nHe might have picked up a letter\nopener and gone after my pineal\ngland!\n\nGONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE.  DUKE'S BODY IS\nGOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  We should get some of\nthat.  Just eat a big handful and\nsee what happens.\n\nGONZO\nSome of what?\n\nDUKE\n(spitting words)\nExtract of pineal!\n\n88.\n\n\nGONZO\n(STARING AT DUKE WITH\nA STRANGE SMILE)\nSure.  That's a good idea.  One\nwhiff of that shit would turn you\ninto something out of a goddamn\nmedical encyclopedia.\n\nGONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK.\n\nGONZO\nMan, your head would swell up like\na watermelon, you'd probably gain\nabout a hundred pounds in two\nhours...\n\nA CLOVEN HOOF BURSTS THROUGH GONZO'S SHOE.\n\nDUKE\nRight!\n\nGONZO\n... grow claws... bleeding warts.\n\nGONZO'S CHEST EXPANDS -- BONY RIBS BURSTING HIS SHIRT.\n\nDUKE\nYes!\n\nGONZO\n... then you'd notice about six\nhuge hairy tits swelling up on your\nback...\n\nA TAIL LASHES, HOOFS STRIKE THE FLOOR.  GONZO TOWERS -- A\nFLAME RED DEMON!\n\nDUKE\nFantastic!\n\nDUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY\nat the bedspread, JERKING IT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM.  His\nheels are dug into the mattress with both KNEES LOCKED,\nEYEBALLS SWELLING.\n\nGONZO-DEMON LOOMS AGAINST THE CEILING.\n\nGONZO\nyou'd go blind... your body would\nturn to wax... they'd have to put\nyou in a wheelbarrow and...\n\nGONZO'S VOICE FADES AWAY -- DUKE'S frenzied gaze reveals\nGONZO REVERTED TO NORMAL HUMAN SHAPE AND SIZE.\n\n89.\n\n\nGONZO\nMan I'll try about anything; but\nI'd never touch a pineal gland.\n\nDUKE\nFINISH THE FUCKING STORY!  What\nhappened?!  What about the glands?\n\nGONZO, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily...\ntowards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE...\n\nGONZO\nJesus, that stuff got right on top\nof you, didn't it.\n\nVEINS stand out on DUKE's forehead.  He is purplish-red.\nOVER THE TOP!  Too late, he realizes he is NEAR DEATH!\n\nDUKE\nMaybe you could just... shove me\ninto the pool, or something...\n\nGONZO shakes his head disgustedly.\n\nGONZO\nIf I put you in the pool right now,\nyou'd sink like a goddamn stone.\nYou took too much.  Jesus, look at\nyour face, you're about to explode.\n\nGONZO sits back down... watching the TV.\n\nGONZO\nDon't try and fight it, or you'll\nget brain bubbles.  Strokes,\naneurysms.  You'll just wither up\nand die.\n\nDUKE FALLS TO THE GROUND, WRITHING, CATATONIC, SINKING INTO\nPARALYSIS.\n\nAND THE SOUND, SUDDENLY AND STRANGELY, OF THE VOICE OF\nRICHARD NIXON AND HIS DISTORTED FACE ON THE TV SCREEN.\n\nNIXON\nSacrifice... sacrifice...\nsacrifice...\n\nDUKE PASSES OUT.\n\nBLACK SCREEN\n\n90.\n\n\nINT.

He lies,\nawkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been\nthere days -- months.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhen I came to the general back\nalley ambiance of the suite was so\nrotten, so incredibly foul.  How\nlong had I been lying there?  Hours?\nDays?  Months?  All these signs of\nviolence.  What had happened?\n\nDUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE\nSIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving\nwhisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights\nreplace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,\npornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered\non a shattered mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere was evidence in this room of\nexcessive consumption of almost\nevery type of drug known to\ncivilized man since 1544 AD.\n\nDUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --\nHOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut what kind of addict would need\nall these coconut husks and crushed\nhoneydew rinds?  Would the presence\nof junkies account for all these\nuneaten french fries?  These\npuddles of glazed ketchup on the\nbureau?  Maybe so, but then why all\nthis booze?  And these crude\npornographic photos smeared with\nmustard that had dried to a hard\nyellow crust...\n\nDUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT\nRAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.\n\n91.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThese were not the hoof prints of\nyour normal god-fearing junkie.

THERE IN THE TOILET BOWL IS THE\nMAGNUM .357!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nSomething ugly had happened.  I was\nsure of it...\n\nDUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.\n\nThe SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.\n\nDUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out\nof the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE\nSMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF...\nsleeping on the sofa.\n\nThe ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.\n\nA hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO\ngrappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is\nmuffling her screams with an ice bag.\n\nMAID\nPlease... please... I'm only the\nmaid.  I didn't mean nothin!...\n\nDUKE\n(jumps up from the\nbed, flashing his\npress badge)\nYOU'RE UNDER ARREST!\n\n92.\n\n\nGONZO\n(to DUKE)\nShe must have used a pass key.

You're just as much a\npart of it as they are!\n\nMAID\nPart of what?\n\nDUKE\nThe dope ring.  You must know\nwhat's going on in this hotel.  Why\ndo you think we're here?\n\nMAID\n(blubbering)\nI know you're cops, but I thought\nyou were just here for that\nconvention.  I swear!  All I wanted\nto do was clean up the room.

I'll help you all you need!\nI hate dope!\n\nDUKE\nSo do we, lady.\n\nGONZO\n(helping her up)\nI think we should put her on the\npayroll.

Don't\nworry if it doesn't add up, that's\nour problem.\n\nGONZO hustles the MAID to the door.\n\nMAID\nYou'd pay me for that?\n\nDUKE\nYou're damn right.  But the first\ntime you say anything about this,\nto anybody -- you'll go straight to\nprison for the rest of your life.\nWhat's your name?\n\nMAID\nAlice.  Just ring Linen Service and\nask for Alice.\n\n94.\n\n\nGONZO\nAlright, Alice... you'll be\ncontacted by Inspector Rock.\nArthur Rock.  He'll be posing as a\npolitician.\n\nDUKE\nInspector Rock will pay you.  In\ncash.  A thousand dollars on the\nninth of every month.\n\nMAID\nOh Lord!  I'd do just about anything\nfor that!\n\nGONZO\nYou and a lot of other people.\n\nDUKE\nThe password is: \"One Hand Washes\nThe Other.\" The minute you hear\nthat, you say \"I fear nothing.\"\n\nMAID\nI fear nothing.\n\nShe repeats the password several times while they listen to\nmake sure she has it right.\n\nGONZO\nOh, and don't bother to make up the\nroom.  That way we won't have to\nrisk another of these little\nincidents, will we?\n\nMAID\nWhatever you say, gentlemen.  I\ncan't tell you how sorry I am about\nwhat happened...\n\nGONZO\nDon't worry, it's all over now.\nThank God for the decent people.\n\nShe smiles, repeating to herself \"One Hand Washes The Other\"\nas GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.\n\nCUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.\n\nA grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.\n\nGONZO ON TAPE\n...

NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT\n\nWHACK!  SHADOWY FIGURES beat up a MAN -- give him A GOOD\nKICKING.

Through the window -- DUKE and GONZO sit at the\ncounter.\n\nINT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe North Star Coffee Lounge seemed\nlike a fairly safe haven from our\nstorms.  No hassles, no talk.  Just\na place to rest and regroup.  I\nwasn't even hungry.\n\nGONZO stuffs a hamburger down PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE\nBEATING going on outside the window.  Duke reads a newspaper.\n\n102.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere was nothing in the atmosphere\nof the North Star to put me on my\nguard...\n\nGONZO\n(to WAITRESS)\nTwo glasses of ice water with ice.\n\nThe WAITRESS brings the ice water.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nShe looked like a burnt out\ncaricature of Jane Russell.  She\nwas definitely in charge here...\n\nGONZO gulps down his glass of water and hands her a napkin.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHe did it very casually, but I knew\nthat our peace was about to be\nshattered.\n\nDUKE\nWhat was that?\n\nGONZO shrugs.\n\nThe WAITRESS stands at the end of the counter with her back\nto them while she ponders the napkin... She turns.\n\nWAITRESS\nWhat is this?\n\nGONZO\nA napkin.\n\nTHE WAITRESS slams the napkin down on the counter.\n\nWAITRESS\nDon't give me that bullshit!  I\nknow what it means!

He PULLS OUT THE RAZOR-\nSHARP HUNTING KNIFE.\n\nGONZO KEEPS HIS EYES ON THE WAITRESS.  He walks about six\nfeet down the aisle and lifts the receiver of the pay phone.\nHe SLICES IT OFF, then brings the receiver back to his stool\nand sits down.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI was stupid with shock -- not\nknowing whether to run or start\nlaughing.\n\nGONZO\n(casual)\nHow much is the lemon meringue pie?\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHer eyes were turgid with fear, but\nher brain was functioning on some\nbasic motor survival level.\n\nWAITRESS\n(blurting -- on automatic)\nThirty-five cents!\n\nGONZO\n(laughing)\nI mean the whole pie.\n\nThe WAITRESS MOANS.  GONZO places a $5 BILL on the counter.\n\nGONZO\nLet's say five dollars.  Okay?\n\n104.\n\n\nGONZO walks round the counter TAKING THE PIE OUT OF THE\nDISPLAY CASE.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe sight of the blade had triggered\nbad memories.  The glazed look in\nher eyes said her throat had been\ncut.  She was still in the grip of\nparalysis when we left.\n\nDUKE IS ROOTED TO THE SPOT.\n\nGONZO urges him out the door.  The camera retreats with them.\n\nThe WAITRESS STANDS THERE -- PETRIFIED.  Alone in a lousy\nbar at night.\n\nINT.

GONZO FRANTICALLY PAWS OVER A MAP.\n\nDUKE drives -- SILENT AND FURIOUS -- sick to his stomach\nwith the PSYCHOTIC GONZO.\n\nGONZO\nWhat are you doing?  You were\nsupposed to turn back there!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had abused every rule that Vegas\nlived by -- burning the locals,\nabusing the tourists, terrifying\nthe help.  The only chance now, I\nfelt, was the possibility that we'd\ngone to such excess that nobody in\nthe position to bring the hammer\ndown on us could possibility\nbelieve it.\n\nDUKE suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.\n\n105.\n\n\nGONZO\nJesus Christ!!!\n\nThere, crossing the road in front of them, is LUCY -- her\npaintings under her arm -- looking lost.

What are\nwe doing out here on this\ngodforsaken road?\n\nGONZO sees that THEY'RE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE AIRPORT\nRUNWAY.\n\nGONZO\nThe airport is over there!\n\nDUKE\nNever missed a plane yet.\n\nDUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the\nWHALE down into the grassy freeway divider.  WHEELS CHURNING,\nHE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight\nup, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER\nA FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the\nRUNWAY.\n\nGONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.  He\nthrows a worried look at DUKE.\n\nDUKE\nI'll drop you right next to the\nplane.\n\nThey SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET\nENGINE SCREAM.\n\nGONZO\nNo!  I can't get out!

Shit, this town is full of\nwhite Cadillac convertibles.  I\nplan to go through there so fast\nthat nobody will even glimpse the\ngoddamn license plate.  You ready?\n\nGONZO\nWhy not?  But for Christ's sake,\njust do it fast!\n\nEXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY\n\nDUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.  GONZO\nJUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE.\n\nDUKE watches him go -- RELENTS.\n\nDUKE\nHey!\n\nGONZO stops -- turns.\n\nDUKE\nDon't take any guff from those\nswine.  Remember, if you have any\ntrouble you can always send a\ntelegram to the Right People.\n\nGONZO\nYeah...

Too weird to\nlive and too rare to die.\n\n107.\n\n\nDUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITH\nTHE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT\n\nOn the TV an airplane soars thru the sky.  Pull back to find\nDUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM.  He is typing on his\ntypewriter.\n\nDUKE\nWe are all wired into a survival\ntrip now.  No more of the speed\nthat fueled that 60's.  That was\nthe fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.\nHe crashed around America selling\n\"consciousness expansion\" without\never giving a thought to the grim\nmeat-hook realities that were lying\nin wait for all the people who took\nhim seriously...\n\nDUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.  The CAMERA slowly\nrises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT\nIMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.\n\nDUKE\nAll those pathetically eager acid\nfreaks who thought they could buy\nPeace and Understanding for three\nbucks a hit.  But their loss and\nfailure is ours too.  What Leary\ntook down with him was the central\nillusion of a whole life-style that\nhe helped create...\n\nRISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30\nFEET HIGH.  DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE\nCAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...\n\nDUKE\n... a generation of permanent\ncripples, failed seekers, who never\nunderstood the essential old-mystic\nfallacy of the Acid Culture: the\ndesperate assumption that somebody...\nor at least some force -- is\ntending the light at the end of the\ntunnel.\n\nHIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX\nSURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON\nSIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT\nLIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.\n\n108.\n\n\nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY\n\nA BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.  The camera pans down to DUKE\nDRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.  A piece of the fence flies out\nof the back seat as he takes a bump.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere was only one road back to L.A.\nUS Interstate 15, just a flat-out\nhigh speed burn through Baker and\nBarstow and Berdoo, then on to the\nHollywood Freeway straight into\nfrantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,\njust another freak in the Freak\nKingdom.\n\nDUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING\nfacing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon\nsign that flashes beer.\n\nDUKE\nAhhh.  Wonderful.\n\nDUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.  Gets out and walks in.\n\nINT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY\n\nDUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR.  Scattered all\nabout the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON\nWHEELS, WOODEN YOKES.  A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE\nRAFTERS.  The sunlight shafts through high windows.  AN OLD\nMAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden\nbar.  A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.\n\nPROPRIETOR\nWhat'll you have?\n\nDUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.\n\nDUKE\n(doubtfully)\nBallantine Ale...?\n\nTHE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.  DUKE SMILES AND\nRELAXES.\n\nDUKE\nHard to find it served like this\nanymore.\n\nAs he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE\nAMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY\nPIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER.  The logo on the rack\nreads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.\n\n109.\n\n\nPROPRIETOR\nWhere ya comin' from, young man?\n\nDUKE\nLas Vegas.\n\nPROPRIETOR\nA great town, that Vegas.  I bet\nyou had good luck there.  You're\nthe type.\n\nDUKE\nI know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.\n\nPROPRIETOR\n(trustingly)\nThat's a fine combination.  You\ncan't lose.\n\nA LOVELY GIRL appears.  Seeing DUKE, she smiles.  CAN THIS\nREALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY?  She approaches him... and...\nKISSES THE PROPRIETOR.\n\nDUKE\n(caught off guard... muttering)\nOh, my God!...\n\nPROPRIETOR\n(not understanding)\nThis is my granddaughter...\n\nDUKE\n(recovering)\nDon't worry...\n(leans forward in confidence)\n... and I'm actually the District\nAttorney from Ignoto County.\n(winks)\nJust another good American like\nyourself.\n\nA MOMENT.  THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.\n\nWordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the\nback of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.\n\nWHO FEELS ASHAMED.\n\nDUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.\n\nEXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY\n\nA CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.\nGets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...\n\n110.\n\n\nA state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.\n\nSomberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags\nstep off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...\n\nDUKE switches on the ignition.  Something rolls off the\ntrembling dash... DUKE catches it...\n\nONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...\n\nDUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES.  THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --\nTEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.\n\nDUKE\nHOLY SHIT!!!\n\nDUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT\nTHE MARINES.\n\nDUKE\nGOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!\n\nDUKE ROARS AWAY.  AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS\nIN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE\nCONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nThe TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.\n\nEXT.

Despite Hip Hop\u2019s sometimes well-deserved reputation for misogyny, four decades of Rap songs have chronicled both the ups and downs of being in love. In 1996, Method Man and Mary J. Blige netted a \u201cBest Performance By A Duo Or Group\u201d Grammy for \u201cI\u2019ll Be There For You (You\u2019re All I Need To Get By).\u201d On the flip side, with \u201cHow Do U Want It,\u201d the late Tupac Shakur took aim at one-time Civil Rights activist and chair of the Black Caucus of the Democratic National Committee C. Delores Tucker. Unlike Meth and Mary, \u2018Pac and Ms. Tucker\u2019s encounter ended on much less happy terms; Tucker\u2019s $10 million defamation lawsuit was thrown out by a federal judge in 1999\n\nNevertheless, as Valentine\u2019s Day approaches, even the most cursory glance at your iTunes or Spotify library can bring up a ton of lovey-dovey memories. In anticipation of Valentine\u2019s Day 2014, HipHopDX\u2019s Editorial Staff listed a few of their favorite R&B and Rap songs. Whether you\u2019re living the single life or enjoying the occasion with your significant other, here our some of our picks. As usual\u2014not that you need an invitation\u2014but feel free to disagree or add your own picks down in the comment section\n\nOutKast - \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d\nThis one is an absolute no brainer for the Hallmark holiday soundtrack. It\u2019s essential that it shows up on your mix, naturally. With the jam band going and the lyrics pouring out, \u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d is like the ultimate track to celebrate the coming of Cupid. Of course this one is basically Andre3000\u2019s since it\u2019s on The Love Below. Don\u2019t call him Three Stacks though on this cut. Nah, he's \u201cCupid Valentino,\u201d and he\u2019s flanked by Joi and \u201cSkreechy Peachy\u201d on the hook. Much like \u201cPlayer\u2019s Ball\u201d is to Christmas, this track can be celebrated any time of the year\n\nJodeci - \u201cLove U 4 Life\u201d\n\nWhen I was younger, I decided this song was going to be played at my wedding. I still feel that way, even though Jodeci is kind of scary looking nowadays. \u201cLove U 4 Life\u201d is just the ultimate eternal love kind of tune. The video though is what really drives the point home. You have T-Boz (yes of TLC) getting married to Dalvin Swing. That was perfect because Dalvin was dating T-Boz at the time. Awwww! It was such a sweet ode to love and it was handled in the least mushy way possible. Heads up though: T-Boz and Dalvin are long since broken up\n112 - \u201cCupid\u201d\n\nIf you don't cry when you hear this song, then you have no heart. Seriously. Room 112 might be where the players dwell, but the Bad Boy group put it all out there. \u201cCupid doesn\u2019t lie, but you won't know unless we give it a try,\u201d they sing on the hook. It\u2019s beautiful and heartfelt, and everything you need out of a love song. Next time you\u2019re bumpin\u2019 \u201cPeaches & Cream\u201d and remembering the good ol\u2019 days, don\u2019t forget to throw this one on too and have a Drake-sized cry. It\u2019ll be worth it. Trust\n\nRaekwon feat. Cappachino, Method Man & Ghostface Killah - \u201cIce Cream\u201d\n\nMethod Man and Mary J. Blige\u2019s \u201cAll I Need\u201d is the default Hip Hop love jam for most non-Wu heads, but a subsequent Meth appearance alongside Rae, Ghostface and Cappadonna (who was still going by Cappachino at the time) is usually the one that appeals to the hard rocks. If Twitter were invented when this dropped back in 1995, #SwapMeetLove might have become a trending hashtag during the premiere of this video. That said, these three Wu Gambinos held it down for an entire pre-Drake generation of males who had trouble articulating their emotions to the ladies in their lives. Having trouble getting down \u201con bended knee\u201d to propose to your boo? Just ask her to \u201cgo ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu.\u201d Besides, any time you can get a Valentine\u2019s Day anthem that personifies women of different ethnicities as ice cream flavors while Ghost references the Supreme Alphabet (\u201cshe turns me on like Vine C Allah Rule\u201d), you gladly take it\n\nFashawn - \u201cLupita\u201d\n\nUnrequited love can be rough in Hip Hop. One end of the spectrum features a bottomless well of self pity best evidenced by Pharcyde\u2019s \u201cPassin\u2019 Me By.\u201d And the other end of the spectrum channels rejection into anger much like when Ice Cube rhymed, \u201cWe didn't get no play, from the ladies / With six niggas in a car are you crazy / She was scared, and it was showin\u2019 / We all said fuck you bitch and kept goin\u2019.\u201d On his 2009 album, Boy Meets World, Fashawn struck the perfect balance. Fash retraces his steps from innocent infatuation (complete with poem writing), to the friend zone and ending with a polite letdown from the object of his affection. \u201cMaybe in another life,\u201d Lupita offered. Damn. Ultimately Fashawn took his L with dignity, and provided a playful, fun and realistic look at what sometimes happens when Cupid\u2019s arrow misfires\n\nUGK - \u201cFeelin\u2019 You\u201d\n\nPrior to his untimely death in 2007, \u201cSweet Jones\u201d was cornering the market on grown man Rap. This wasn\u2019t merely throwing on a button down oxford and breaking out some soft raps over Neptunes production. Pimp C was laying down his full-on linen suit, Tom Joyner boat cruise, middle aged mack. He shouts out the women who value \u201cputtin\u2019 it down for your kids\u201d and temporarily retires some of his more abrasive bars in favor of a falsetto and some backing harmony on the hook. Producer Steve Below flipped Maze featuring Frankie Beverly\u2019s \u201cFeel That You\u2019re Feelin\u2019,\u201d but just because this is mature fare doesn\u2019t mean Bun and Pimp are getting geriatric with it. All ladies with \u201cthe backside swole up\u201d and a mix of \u201cclass and panache with precision\u201d get invited to this affair that features the Port Arthur, Texas natives trading in trunk popping for two-stepping\n\nMurs - \u201cLove & Appreciate\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all in the details. Murs didn\u2019t set out to make a generic love songs with random lovey-dovey quotes. Instead, Mr. Nick Carter rapped from the heart about love, appreciation and how these apply to a special woman in his life. Murs\u2019 vivid storytelling is powerful here and his words sound sincere in every bar. From helping one another pay bills to watching her favorite television show, Murs shows that a good love song, like a good relationship, finds success in the details\n\nMethod Man feat. Mary J. Blige - \u201cAll I Need\u201d\n\nLove isn\u2019t always perfect, but it is meant to comfort. That comfort shines when the skies are gray, and someone rubs you on your back and says, \u201cBaby, it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d Love is meant to uplift. So when you feel like you\u2019re nothin\u2019, the person you love should make you feel like you are somethin\u2019. Method Man captured all of this quite well, matching his impeccable flow with Mary J. Blige\u2019s soothing melodies, on \u201cI\u2019ll Be There For You / You\u2019re All I Need To Get By.\u201d Valentine\u2019s cards? Please. Also, he may not need \u201call that romance\u201d stuff to show love, but Method Man crafted one of the best Valentine\u2019s Day Hip Hop songs of all time with this love song\n\nImmortal Technique feat. Jean Grae - \u201cYou Never Know\u201d\nYou might also likeThis may not be the most cheerful song in this playlist, but it is a powerful selection about love and why it should not be taken for granted. With \u201cYou Never Know,\u201d Immortal Technique penned a chilling story vivid enough for movie theaters. Clocking in at more than seven minutes, Technique blends heartfelt lyrics with striking imagery to explain why love should be valued. Moreover, the song speaks to the somber tone that this day can have for some and the story is impactful with a surprising ending. Technique delivers one of his most masterful performances as Jean Grae provides a strong guest spot. The song is a sobering reminder that one must appreciate their love \u201cto the fullest extent and then beyond \u2018cause you never really know what you\u2019ve got until it\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nPlies feat. Ne-Yo - \u201cBust It Baby Part 2\u201d\n\nAnother term for \u201clove of my life\u201d is \u201cbust it baby,\u201d and no one quite coins the term like Florida\u2019s pride-and-joy Plies. First of all, Ne-Yo can make any song beautiful. It\u2019s like you forget about the verses and find yourself only singing along to Ne-Yo\u2019s catchy hooks, every damn time. This is song is different. Plies brings Valentine\u2019s Day-worthy quotes to the table, the kind you\u2019d love to see sweetly scribbled on a yellow post-it note to remind you of how special you are. \u201cSpeakin\u2019 for the goons, thank God for makin\u2019 you\u201d is just one example. Plies also provides alternative pet names (\u201cwet wet\u201d and \u201clil boo\u201d) all packaged together in under four minutes. Plus, if this song is good enough for Janet Jackson, then it\u2019s good enough for your V-Day playlist\n\nBonus: Fabolous feat. P. Diddy & Jagged Edge - \u201cTrade It All (Pt. 2)\u201d\n\nBefore Diddy was Diddy but after Puff Daddy was Puff Daddy, P. Diddy joined Fabolous for a revised version of Fab\u2019s Jagged Edge-assisted track, \u201cTrade It All.\u201d The single is best known for being part of the 2002 film Barbershop\u2019s soundtrack, but alone it made it made it\u2019s way into the top 20 of Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart. Its accolades aren\u2019t why it deserves to be noticed as a Valentine\u2019s Day track. \u201cGirl I\u2019d trade it all, money, cars and everything\u201d sings Jagged Edge harmoniously on the hook while Fab (whose \u201ccharm is a felony\u201d) and Diddy woo the ladies in their own distinct manner. Desert Storm\u2019s DJ Clue and DURO provide the sunny layout which brings out the shine in the song. Overall, the single is made to make you feel goodEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 6, "api_path": "/songs/14556", "artist_names": "Coo Coo Cal", "full_title": "My Projects

Ness]\nSummer Madness 2, hm\nIt almost feels like I signed up for a death wish\n'Cause this the first time I'm the favorite and he's the underdog\nSo y'all gon' cheer for anything he says, 'cause y'all don't expect shit\nBut if I come with Making The Band, cheesecake, and P. Diddy jokes, I might see the respect switch\nSo I guess going bar for bar's the only option I'm left with\nI was supposed to battle Mook, Lux, and Serius, but they ain't wanna accept this\nSo URL work hard to get me on the card, and I knew when I made it, leave the rest sick\nOnce I said I'll take the Making The Band nigga, they said, \"well we can get him for a flight, hotel, and less chips\"\nSo since Smack milked him for what he's worth, then it's only right I get rid of Ness quick (Nesquik)\nNow let's talk about your career in the industry, 'cause it's sad, but this is what I gotta do to hurt you\n'Cause you had your chance to make the deaf jam (Def Jam) but Bad Boy jocked you from going Universal\nAtlantic didn't want you, Interscope didn't need you, so royalty checks you would never see none\nLooks like them labels gave everybody else a deal, but forgot to gave E one (E1)\nThat's 'cause ya image is horrible and all ya songs is trash\nAnd every verse you spit is plane, so A&Rs get bored and pass (boardin' pass)\nNow what got me mad is you actually had a chance to be signed star\nSo since Bad Boy ain't never let you shine (Shyne), it's only right I make you suffer behind bars\n\n(E. Ness: \"That shit wack... That ain't bar for bar.\")\n\nAnd speaking of prison, once I grab that ratchet, cock it back, aim and pull it\nYou won't have to spend a year in jail for you to take a bullet\nSo you better die, just see ARs (C-A-R), when these hammers'll blast\n'Cause I run up and put a magnum on E like you ran outta gas\n\n(E. Ness: \"Not today. Not today.\")\n\nSo keep frontin' like you on your block and it's live as shit\nHow you got cookies on your strip and you got pies to flip\nI guarantee I knock your spirit out your soul once this .9'll spit\n'Cause once I give E forty (E-40), y'all gon' see his ghost ride the whip\n\n(E. Ness: \"That's light! That's light... You know that's light...\")\n\nNow with bars like that, it just proves you can't last a round\nBut it's Summer Madness 2, I figured I give y'all some action now\nOkay, cool, Ness, play Peter Parker 'til I roll up like Mary Jane and let that Glock pop\n'Cause with these metal arms you can get eight like Doc Ock\nAnd if I let that hammer flash, ya parents'll die, and you'll never see ya son again\nSee, ya aunt may (May) survive, but these bullets'll still make ya uncle bend (Ben)\nNow with wordplay like that, it ain't no stopping me, nigga\nBut I can't just give 'em action, I gotta give y'all comedy, nigga\nYou look like a cokehead, Ness\nIt you look like a cokehead, Ness\nTrust me, me and my team know\nIt look like on every Friday, you take a brick to the face like Deebo\nWell just know I crack heads like Ezal for thinking I'm a joke, B\nAnd like Craig, y'all gon' see red after I smoke E (Smokey)\nNow after breaking down Friday and Spider-Man, y'all probably think it's nothing left to say\n'Cause using motion pictures, I just showed y'all how to move E (movie) in every way\nIt's round one, it's getting hot in here\nAnd Webster Hall, y'all know my slogan\n\n(Crowd: \"Get him the fuck outta here!\")\n\nNo, get E. Ness the fuck outta here!\nEvery time I battle Philly rappers, I kill 'em, I got Rone and Tech the fuck outta here!\nIn that third round, I got my tooth the fuck outta here!\nFuck every legend on the card! Get Iron, Lux, Serious, and Mook the fuck outta here!\nWhat's up!\nWhat's up!\n\n[Round 2: E. Ness]\nSee, I knew what you was gon' do DNA, that's why you're so typical\n'Cause out of all the battle rappers that ever graced the stage, you the most typical\nSee, we can take this shit outside, if you wanna get physical\nOr we can keep this shit on-stage, and I'mma make this shit Biblical\nYou see I knew what you was gon' talk about my fights on TV\nOr my gripes with PD\nOr how I got dropped off the label and ain't put out one CD\nBut in the back of ya mind, you subconsciously wanna be me\nSo when I say I got the burner, I'm not talking about no CD\nSee that one verse I wrote for P. Diddy for Press Play\nMade me a very very very wealthy man the next day\nSo the next time I hear one you faggots say he broke and he off-point\nJust go to number thirteen, 'Diddy Rock' featuring Shawnna and Timbaland off the Press Play joint\nIf a nigga still frontin' like I ain't made no money\nBurger King bought the rights to the song for-\n\n(*Crowd interupts with boos*)\n\nNah. Nah, nah, nah...\n\nRight now he tryin' to figure some shit he could rebuttal\nBut this the second round, so I'mma make 'em see double\nThey threw me DNA 'cause they'd thought he'd give me trouble\nBut this nigga wouldn't blow if he had the dicksucking lips from Ms. Hustle\nDNA, you in the way, bro\nContinue with the shade show\n'Cause I know and they know\nSmack put you on the payroll\nNorbes tried to set me up, but you the one got played though\n'Cause you the weak nigga of the family around Fredo\nNow, let me tell you the difference between metaphors and real rap\nIt's when real rap take the stage, all the metaphors chillax\nTell Smack, he better kill that, 'fore he get his shit peeled back\n'Cause there's real niggas in the building that don't fuck with Smack that's gon' feel that\nI know Smack gon' try to play me, 'cause he told you what he pay me\nBut it don't make me or break me, 'cause these guns is off safety\n\n(*Crowd boos*)\n\nY'all just bore me\n\nShotty blast, karate class\nI'm Jason without the hockey mask\nWhy everytime somebody battle on Smack, they say bodybag\nNiggas say \"zip it up\", niggas say \"landslide\"\nTsunami using subtitles, giving Smack handjobs\nNiggas never step to me, why?\n'Cause I'm a landmine\nAnd everytime I land mine, they relocate they grandmom\nI don't drive by, I walk by\nAccurate as Hawkeye\nYou fucking with a Big Mac, dog, you's a small fry\nHolla gon say \"ballgame\", you gon' be the fall guy\nWhen I let a spark fly, split him like apartheid\nTales from the Darkside, scene out of Saw 5\nExecutionist style, do it while he hogtied\nThey say if you gotta do the crime, then you gotta do the time\nThen DNA, you gon' get a five to ten for that New York state of mind\nYou should be locked away\nYou know what I'm about to say?\nHow the fuck they gon' sic Nate Robinson on Dr. J?!\nWhat, you thought you was in New York, you was gon' have the homecourt advantage?\n\n(Crowd member: \"Yes!\")\n\nWell I'm gon' tell you in English what Cortez scared to tell you in Spanish\nNigga, you's a bitch, without the pocket book and the wig\nKnock his head off, step back like, look what I did\nI ain't wanna come to Philly, so you know y'all pussy\nCame back up the turn pipe, let's Bang Bang Boogie\nRun up on DNA with that same damn hoodie\nMake 'em toss up them same damn cookies\nI leave his brains by his feet, or put a stain in his sheet\n'Cause I'm really not the one that you came to defeat\n\n(*Crowd boos*)\n\nY'all ain't wanna hear me\nY'all ain't come to hear me\nY'all ain't come to hear me\nY'all ain't wanna hear me\n\nAnd why every battle, you getting all these dumbass shirts made\nThat's the type of shit my son learn how to make in first grade\nBut after this\nLung cancer at the third stage\nDNA, you's a bird brain\nYou ain't never served 'caine\nAll you ever did was look out when the first came\nHis first name my middle name\nYeah, he got a little fame\nBut when it come to the boss, you always gon' be the middle man\n\n(Crowd member: \"Time!\")\n\n(*Crowd boos*)\n\nI walk to Brooklyn 'til my feet hurt--\n\n(*Crowd boos interrupt E. Ness*)\n\nY'all niggas... Y'all niggas... That shit ain't cool\nThat shit ain't cool\nGo ahead man, go ahead Smack\nY'all got it, man\n\nY'all niggas came here to boo me\nY'all niggas came here to boo me\nReal shit\nY'all niggas came here to boo me\nI give a fuck\n\n[Round 2: DNA & E. Ness]\nAight, I'mma freestyle, check it out\n\n(Smack: \"Be careful, 'cause they spilled something, don't slip, my nigga.\")\n\nLet me ask you a question, Ness\nYou said on the Play album, that you wrote \"Diddy Rock\"?\nWell that shit's hilarious, 'cause you still don't got nothin' on that Diddy rock\nAnd let's be honest, after that crowd booed you, you should back out\nI'm glad Q-Tip's there, so he can throw your wax out\nAnd after that crowd booed you, they should stop that shit\nAs soon as I bust a rhyme (Busta Rhyme'), I'm killing your whole Conglomerate\n\n(E. Ness: \"Ahhh.\")\n\n(E. Ness: \"They came to boo me.\")\n\nNow how the fuck does anyone on this Summer Madness stage doubting me\nWhen I just killed E. Ness using everybody on that balcony\nBut check it, see this the round where I break you down, so all that bullshit gotta stop, Ness\n'Cause in every rhyme you say you push crack on the street or you got coke on the block, Ness\nQuestion: who have you cut, who have you stabbed, who have you shot, Ness?\n\n(E. Ness: \"Plenty niggas!\")\n\nIf you've done neither [?] then we can't just believe you bust your Glock, Ness\n\n(E. Ness: \"Plenty niggas.\")\n\nGangster? Honestly that's something that I'm not, Ness\n\n(E. Ness: \"What is you talking about.\")\n\n\nBut your rap name's Elliott Ness, and you thought that was hot, Ness?\nIf you won't tell the world, I will, you named yourself after a cop, Ness\nSo you supposed to this monster when you getting niggas locked, Ness (Loch Ness)\n\n(E. Ness ranting: \"You know that shit is light. That shit light. You know that shit light. I come- I'm a dinosaur, he know that. That shit- Charlie. Come on. They came to boo me. That shit fixed. Fuck outta here. You know. Both of you niggas know. Laugh. Fuck that shit, man, that shit corny. Y'all niggas corny. Y'all niggas corny. All three of y'all niggas. All four of y'all niggas. And Norbes too, I'mma talk to Norbes when I see him about that shit. Shit is nutty.\")\n\n(Smack: \"Hold it down, hold it down, hold it down.\")\n\nSo everytime you say you untouchable and you wild with chrome\nThat just makes me think of the Untouchables, and how you put away Al Capone\nYou arrested a known gangster for bootlegging liquor, now you acting like you all hard\nBut by doing that, you showed us you don't like rap, 'cause that proved you don't support bars\n\n(E. Ness trying to predict DNA's rhymes: \"--You don't support the bars...\")\n\n(E. Ness, loudly: \"Boooo! Fuck outta here! That shit nutty! That shit nutty! That shit nutty! That shit nutty! Boo! That shit nutty. That ain't bars.\")\n\nAnd ya parents named you Lloyd Mathis, now that's saying a lot\n'Cause you got the last name of a judge, and your rap name's the same as a cop\nBut through all that, you still want us to believe you bust ratchets?\nOh I get it, since you bang hammers in court, we shouldn't judge Mathis\n\n(E. Ness: \"Aaaahhhhhh! Nigga, go to my rap sheet, nigga. Go 'head rap. Nigga, rap.\")\n\nC'mon man\n\n(*Crowd reacts loudly*)\n\n(E. Ness: \"Yeah, get him! Yeah, get him!\")\n\nYo my nigga, on some real shit, are you gonna shut the fuck up when I rap?\nOr will I, do I, or do I really have to clap heat?\n\n(E. Ness talking through round again: \"Bleh bleh bleh bleh bleh...\")\n\n'Cause you see what happened when I brought up the last Philadelphia nigga's rap sheet\nSo why you still talking, 'cause here's a known theory\nSince when do y'all know a judge that had no jury (jewelry)\nAnd I do mean no jewelry, 'cause that chain's made out of aluminum, that's why it got foil in it\nYour brother'll be in the dirt, his casket will have soil in it\nI take your brand new infant, put 'em in a pot and watch 'em boil in it\nNow the last three words fit you and your family perfect, 'cause they got all you (oil) in it\nBut I ain't just going to kill 'em like that, I'mma switch to some different shit\n\n(Crowd member: \"Oh my God!\")\n\nBut I ain't just going to kill 'em like that, I'mma switch to some different shit\nSince you overweight and outta shape, kill you with some Olympic shit\nIf they had you run laps in London, they would make you cry for help\nSo just know this tech'll leave you wet and in trunks like Michael Phelps\nYou better get advice from Gabby Douglas, and all of her gymnastics\n'Cause when this gat spit\nY'all gon see some assaulted (somersaulted) with no backflips\nAnd even your bitch would be Olympian\n'Cause in bed, she good with head and she love to squirt\nWoulda thought she won a gold medal, 'cause every time we fuck, she come in (cummin') first\nSee, that was hot but it's about to get fuckin' worse\n'Cause word is in Philly, you work at a supermarket, so how you got time for rappin'?\nWhen I told disc- when I told Clips this shit, we pictured, started dyin' laughin'\n\n(E. Ness reacts in outrage, throwing his water bottle and spilling water on the camera lens: \"Oh! You heard this-- Yo! Nah, man. Yo! Get this nigga outta here. Man, get the fuck outta here. Not tryin' to hear that shit. Get this nigga outta here. Get this nigga the fuck outta here, man. Get this nigga the fuck outta here, man. You choked. Nigga, fuck outta here. Boo that nigga! Now boo that nigga! You choked! Ain't tryin' to hear that shit, man. You choked. Let the nigga rap. Go ahead Clip. Let that nigga rap, man. Go ahead, man.\")\n\n(Crowd member: \"Say it with your chest!\")\n\n(E. Ness: \"Aight li-- C'mon man. Nah fuck that, man.\")\n\n(Crowd start chanting in unison: \"Cheesecake! Cheesecake! Cheesecake! Cheesecake!\")\n\n(*Smack tries to calm the crowd down*)\n\nCheck it\n\n(E. Ness: \"Real shit, but you didn't beat me, nigga, the crowd helped you.\")\n\nAight nigga, [?], [?] let me rhyme\n\n(E. Ness: \"Fuck outta here... This nigga choking. Fuck outta here.\")\n\nYo\nLike I said\nWord is you worked at a supermarket in Philly, so how you got time for rappin'?\nWhen I told Clips this shit, we pictured you walking down the aisle and started dyin' laughin'\nI said you dumb for working there, but Clips said you the smart type\n'Cause your job ain't bullshit if you could pay your bills for pushing a cart right\nNow I got a main problem with you, Ness\nIt's how you want us battle rappers to be respectable\nWhen everybody on Bad Boy don't got respect for you\nIf Biggie was alive, that nigga would probably snuff you\nIf Black Rob seen you, that nigga probably cut you\nLil Kim wouldn't give you head, Faith Evans wouldn't touch you\nCome to think of it, nigga, even Jae Millz said \"fuck you\"\nSo nigga, fuck you!\n'Cause every time I see your battle, they fucking trash!\n\n(E. Ness: \"Fuck.\")\n\nI hate your fucking face, your fucking clothes, and your fucking swag\n\n(E. Ness: \"Fucking-\")\n\nFuck your gang, fuck your set, fuck your flag\n\n(E. Ness: \"Bullshit outta here.\")\n\nFuck your mom, fuck your aunt, fuck your girl\nThe only person I won't say is \"fuck your dad\"\nThat's 'cause he died, but if he was alive, he'll be fucking mad\nSeeing a twenty year old kill him, makes him fucking mad\nLet them know that you a bitch, you a snitch, and fucking fag\nYou 35, back on SMACK, you doing fucking bad\nThat's 'cause you a pussy and a fucking bitch\nYour career [?]\nLook in my eyes when I talk to you, you don't know who you fuckin' with\nI should spit on you, nigga, you make me fucking sick\nLook in my eyes when I rhyme, you don't got no fucking house and no fucking whip\nI use fucking in all them other bars to let you know you should fucking quit\nNow that I disposed him, who still believe that he king?\nI just took away E heart (E-Hart)\n(E. Ness: \"Say the cheesecake line again. Say the cheesecake line again.\")\nNow he can go battle at Queen of the Ring\n\n[Round 3: E. Ness]\nDNA stands for the 'Dirtiest Nigga Alive'\nThis is the cleanest you have ever been, and I'm somewhat surprised\nNow someone tell DNA to open up his eyes\n'Cause when you taking niggas money, that's a whole different high\nNow we'd all like to thank Charlie Clips for taking care of DNA\nI woulda been his father if his mother had the E&J\nWell Charlie, I'm truly sorry it had to be this way\nMy llama like a fucking piranha, I let it eat away\nSee ya music is trash, your mixtapes never sell\nOnly way you'll get a deal is if you take one to tell\nI don't know why the fuck they gave me you\nI'm crazier than crazy glue\nYeah, I've been skating through, since 1982\nI've been doing this before the Yankees wore navy blue\nFuck rap, you get smacked\n\n(*Crowd boos*)\n\nWow\nY'all niggas booing, man\nY'all niggas hating\nListen, I'm not even gonna finish that\nLet him rap\nNah, nah\nThey fucking my shit up\n\n(*Smack tries to calm the crowd down*)\n\nI don't know why the fuck they gave me you\nI'm crazier than crazy glue\nYeah, I've been skating through, since 1982\nI've been doing this before the Yankees wore navy blue\nAnd fuck rap, you get smrrracked\nLook at what you made me do\nAnd you getting lazy too, I seen ya last battle\nIf that Tech ain't jam in that third round, my man woulda had you\nI say that to say this\nNiggas like you, I can't bang with\nWhy?\n'Cause you only as tough as them niggas you hang with\nAnd y'all gon' hate when I say this\nWhen I say Mook ain't the greatest\n'Cause Mook ain't been talked about since Math gave him a facelift\nWord is Math Hoffa ain't no gat-popper\n\n(*Crowd boos*)\n\nI guess you held ya own\nBut then you really did some faggot shit to kill [?]\nSee, Rone for Rone, bar for bar woulda beat you probably\nBut what type of nigga you know tape a fake bomb to his body?\nHe ripped off his hoodie, no t-shirt, no tanktop\nYour whole career's been built off the glass, you're a bankshop\nNow let me tell you some more faggot shit when you battle Big Titus\nI'mma expose this litte nigga for the people that didn't see it\nSome super duper gay shit, man, I just couldn't believe it\n'Cause the first half of that second round was talking about that man penis\nNow I'mma tell you some more shit I found out about this nigga when I was coming up the highway\nThis bum ass nigga tried to take Charli Baltimore out on a date to TGI Friday\nNow you need to beg one of the labels to give you some money\nAnd stop trying to treat these hoes to a '2 for 20'\nThis faggot just cut his dick off\nAnd sit next Rick Ross\nWear a bunch of lip gloss\nGo and get his shit tossed\nThis fight was fixed, don't you feel like you ripped off?\nScrolling through them call logs, looking through them miss calls\nAsk ya man, should you battle Ness, he told you \"nig, nah\"\nI fuck with you and everything, but I'm not going with y'all\nFucking with him, you done ran into a brick wall\nPitfall, Chris Paul\nWhen he get his shit off\nThese diamonds are forever\nSay something clever\n'Cause nobody what you say, I'm gon' translate it better\nAnd that bullshit move, you threw on Youtube\nWas the dumbest shit I seen in my life to get views\nNow...\n\nGo ahead, let him have it, let him have it\n\n[Round 3: DNA & E. Ness]\nRound one and two, I already show y'all who's the better rapper\nBut this the part where we analyze your career like a book and go through every chapter\nSee, I done mentioned cheesecake, Making The Band, and P Diddy\n'Cause y'all would say it's predictable and call it wack\nBut ask yourself this, what else has E. Ness done to put his career on the map?\nSo instead of saying I'm being predictable, tell this man he hasn't progressed\nI bet you never thought of that, 'cause if in ten years you only known for three things, now whose fault is this?\nSee this battle rap world started off as a network and over time it became community\nSo to see someone make it, we should all be happy and spread the unity\nBut I'm angry at what you could've been, and for that, you a fool to me\n'Cause every battle rapper wouldve died for that opportunity\nSo as a man, as a father, as a artist, you are useless\nYou don't blog, do videos, or put out any music\nSo how could you get mad if we mention cheese cake, Making A Band, P Diddy, or you getting fucking shelved\nWhen you had several opportunities in your career to do something else\nThat's why the stuff I'm telling you right now is some of the realest shit\nThere's a hundred dudes that should be in your spot, 'cause they was really out killing shit\nIron Solomon and MySonne joked about that cheese cake, nigga, I'm dead serious\nThey started something, but with this scheme right here, I'mma finish it\nI'll bet everybody you know gave you a pound when you made it on that show\n'Cause they thought you was all great\nLittle did they know you were [?]\n'Cause after Biggie died, Diddy had lost faith\nThought ya music was bananas, but you realized it wasn't by your fourth tape\nSo he shelved you on your birthday, and you went into depression and started pitching that raw base\nBut have to provide for your kids, so you traded in them karats, started gaining more weight\nDo anything to make sure they get food all month and make sure they all safe\nNow y'all don't need a pineapple to see his life's upside down and in the wrong place\nSo going to Juniors made sense, 'cause in the end, all Diddy ever gave you was short cake\nNow I want no applause for that, so don't start shaking my hand\nThat was just chapter one, chapter two is Making The Band\nWhen Diddy first started fucking with you, he liked for your aggressiveness and your passion\nSo much to the point that out of everyone on that show, he made you the captain\nThought you would have a bright future, thought would move in the world far\nSo how the fuck did you let Chopper become more popular than you on World Star?\n\n(E. Ness: \"Fuck outta here.\")\n\nYou don't do no shows, don't put out no mixtapes, you ain't seeing bling\nAnd Babs is more popular than you in battle rap off of hosting Queen of the Ring\nNow MySonne and Iron Solomon joked about The Band, but nigga, I'm dead serious, they started something\nBut with this scheme right here, I'mma finish it\nYou see, your career is like the internet, it started off at a high speed, and you became the man quick\nBut made a lot of bad connections, so all of Puff's plans switched\nLost every industry friend, nobody to dial up, and all of ya fans dipped\nAnd now got the lowest buzz online out of anyone you was in that band with (bandwidth)\nBut I don't want no cheers for that, so don't start making mad noise\n'Cause that was chapter two, chapter three is Bad Boy\nNow clearly Puff don't fuck with you, or you don't know math, boy\n'Cause that chain you got says B, that lets me know you don't know how to add, boy\n(E. Ness: \"It's a L, nigga. Loch Ness! Loch Ness!\")\nGet it, B, add boy, that equals Bad Boy\nFor the fact your chain doesn't say that, that lets me know you doing bad, boy\nDid I speed it up too fast, am I going too fast, boy?\nLooks like Puff and no one on that label fuck with you on Bad Boy\nYou should palm smacked 'til you fall\n'Cause out of everybody, you got the worse contract of them all\nIf they woulda gave that to Black Rob, he woulda say \"Whoa!\"\nWhoa! Whoa! Whoa!\nG. Dep woulda asked for a Special Delivery and been gone\nMase woulda hopped on his horse and carriage as soon as that bread's gone\n112 would say it's over now\nFaith Evans was too head strong\nBiggie looked you dead in the eye and told you you Dead Wrong\nNow in conclusion to my third round, as y'all see, I killed him, E. Ness is deceased\nNow finally this young man can start resting in peace\nIt's round three, it's getting hot in here\nAnd off the career choices you made, you got yourself the fuck outta here!Embed"},

catch up again\nI'm gonna say my worrying days are done\nAnd this looks like a good day to run\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy baby's been working as a cashier\nShe didn't get a vacation this past year, but now it won't be long\nWe don't need no destination\nJust a tank of gas and a good clear station playing our favorite song\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nThere's some places that we ain't been\nSome things that we ain't done\nAnd it sure looks like a good day to run\n\n[Chorus]\nWide open down a two-lane highway\nIt's about time that some things went my way\nThrowing troubles out to the wind\nAnd I'm praying that

can music save your mortal soul\nAnd can you teach me how to dance real slow?\n[Verse 3]\nWell, I know that you're in love with him\n'Cause I saw you dancing in the gym\nYou both kicked off your shoes (Both kicked off your shoes)\nMan, I dig those rhythm and blues\n\n[Verse 4]\nI was a lonely teenage bronking buck\nWith a pink carnation and a pick-up truck\nBut I knew that I was out of luck\nThe day the music died\nI started singing\n\n[Chorus]\nBye, bye, Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry\nAnd good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye\nSinging this'll be the day that I die\nThis'll be the day that I die\n\n[Verse 5]\nI met a girl who sang the blues\nAnd I asked her for some happy news\nBut she just smiled and turned away\nWell, I went down to the sacred store\nWhere I'd heard the music years before\nBut the man there said the music wouldn't play\nYou might also like[Verse 6]\nWell now, in the streets the children screamed (The children

Father, Son and the Holy Ghost\nThey caught the last train for the coast\nThe day the music died\nWe started singing\n\n[Chorus]\nBye, bye, Miss American Pie\nDrove my Chevy to the levee but the levee

His name was Bob Kiley, but everybody called him Rat.\nA friend of his gets killed, so about a week later Rat sits down and writes a letter to the guy's sister. Rat tells her what a great brother she had, how together the guy was, a number one pal and comrade. A real soldier's soldier, Rat says. Then he tells a few stories to make the point, how her brother would always volunteer for stuff nobody else would volunteer for in a million years, dangerous stuff, like doing recon or going out on these really badass night patrols. Stainless steel balls, Rat tells her. The guy was a little crazy, for sure, but crazy in a good way, a real daredevil, because he liked the challenge of it, he liked testing himself, just man against gook. A great, great guy, Rat says.\n\nAnyway, it's a terrific letter, very personal and touching. Rat almost bawls writing it. He gets all teary telling about the good times they had together, how her brother made the war seem almost fun, always raising hell and lighting up villes and bringing smoke to bear every which way. A great sense of humor, too. Like the time at this river when he went fishing with a whole damn crate of hand grenades. Probably the funniest thing in world history, Rat says, all that gore, about twenty zillion dead gook fish. Her brother, he had the right attitude. He knew how to have a good time. On Halloween, this real hot spooky night, the dude paints up his body all different colors and puts on this weird mask and hikes over to a ville and goes trick-or-treating almost stark naked, just boots and balls and an M-16. A tremendous human being, Rat says. Pretty nutso sometimes, but you could trust him with your life.\n\nAnd then the letter gets very sad and serious. Rat pours his heart out. He says he loved the guy. He says the guy was his best friend in the world. They were like soul mates, he says, like twins or something, they had a whole lot in common. He tells the guy's sister he'll look her up when the war's over.\nSo what happens?\nRat mails the letter. He waits two months. The dumb cooze never writes back.\nA true war story is never moral. It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behavior, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. If a story seems moral, do not believe it. If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie. There is no rectitude whatsoever. There is no virtue. As a first rule of thumb, therefore, you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil. Listen to Rat Kiley. Cooze, he says. He does not say bitch. He certainly does not say woman, or girl. He says cooze. Then he spits and stares. He's nineteen years old\u2014it's too much for him\u2014so he looks at you with those big sad gentle killer eyes and says cooze, because his friend is dead, and because it's so incredibly sad and true: she never wrote back.\nYou can tell a true war story if it embarrasses you. If you don't care for obscenity, you don't care for the truth; if you don't care for the truth, watch how you vote. Send guys to war, they come home talking dirty.\n\nListen to Rat: \"Jesus Christ, man, I write this beautiful fuckin' letter, I slave over it, and what happens? The dumb cooze never writes back.\"\nThe dead guy's name was Curt Lemon. What happened was, we crossed a muddy river and marched west into the mountains, and on the third day we took a break along a trail junction in deep jungle. Right away, Lemon and Rat Kiley started goofing. They didn't understand about the spookiness. They were kids; they just didn't know. A nature hike, they thought, not even a war, so they went off into the shade of some giant trees\u2014quadruple canopy, no sunlight at all\u2014and they were giggling and calling each other yellow mother and playing a silly game they'd invented. The game involved smoke grenades, which were harmless unless you did stupid things, and what they did was pull out the pin and stand a few feet apart and play catch under the shade of those huge trees. Whoever chickened out was a yellow mother. And if nobody chickened out, the grenade would make a light popping sound and they'd be covered with smoke and they'd laugh and dance around and then do it again.\nIt's all exactly true.\n\nIt happened, to me, nearly twenty years ago, and I still remember that trail junction and those giant trees and a soft dripping sound somewhere beyond the trees. I remember the smell of moss. Up in the canopy there were tiny white blossoms, but no sunlight at all, and I remember the shadows spreading out under the trees where Curt Lemon and Rat Kiley were playing catch with smoke grenades. Mitchell Sanders sat flipping his yo-yo. Norman Bowker and Kiowa and Dave Jensen were dozing, or half dozing, and all around us were those ragged green mountains.\n\nExcept for the laughter things were quiet.\nAt one point, I remember, Mitchell Sanders turned and looked at me, not quite nodding, as if to warn me about something, as if he already knew, then after a while he rolled up his yo-yo and moved away.\nIt's hard to tell you what happened next.\nThey were just goofing. There was a noise, I suppose, which must've been the detonator, so I glanced behind me and watched Lemon step from the shade into bright sunlight. His face was suddenly brown and shining. A handsome kid, really. Sharp gray eyes, lean and narrow-waisted, and when he died it was almost beautiful, the way the sunlight came around him and lifted him up and sucked him high into a tree full of moss and vines and white blossoms.\nIn any war story, but especially a true one, it's difficult to separate what happened from what seemed to happen. What seems to happen becomes its own happening and has to be told that way. The angles of vision are skewed. When a booby trap explodes, you close your eyes and duck and float outside yourself. When a guy dies, like Curt Lemon, you look away and then look back for a moment and then look away again. The pictures get jumbled; you tend to miss a lot. And then afterward, when you go to tell about it, there is always that surreal seemingness, which makes the story seem untrue, but which in fact represents the hard and exact truth as it seemed.\nIn many cases a true war story cannot be believed. If you believe it, be skeptical. It's a question of credibility. Often the crazy stuff is true and the normal stuff isn't, because the normal stuff is necessary to make you believe the truly incredible craziness.\nIn other cases you can't even tell a true war story. Sometimes it's just beyond telling.\n\nI heard this one, for example, from Mitchell Sanders. It was near dusk and we were sitting at my foxhole along a wide muddy river north of Quang Ngai. I remember how peaceful the twilight was. A deep pinkish red spilled out on the river, which moved without sound, and in the morning we would cross the river and march west into the mountains. The occasion was right for a good story.\n\"God's truth,\" Mitchell Sanders said. \"A six-man patrol goes up into the mountains on a basic listening-post operation. The idea's to spend a week up there, just lie low and listen for enemy movement. They've got a radio along, so if they hear anything suspicious\u2014anything\u2014they're supposed to call in artillery or gunships, whatever it takes. Otherwise they keep strict field discipline. Absolute silence. They just listen.\"\n\nSanders glanced at me to make sure I had the scenario. He was playing with his yo-yo, dancing it with short, tight little strokes of the wrist.\n\nHis face was blank in the dusk.\n\n\"We're talking regulation, by-the-book LP. These six guys, they don't say boo for a solid week. They don't got tongues. All ears.\"\n\n\"Right,\" I said.\n\n\"Understand me?\"\n\n\"Invisible.\"\n\nSanders nodded.\n\n\"Affirm,\" he said. \"Invisible. So what happens is, these guys get themselves deep in the bush, all camouflaged up, and they lie down and wait and that's all they do, nothing else, they lie there for seven straight days and just listen. And man, I'll tell you\u2014it's spooky. This is mountains. You don't know spooky till you been there. Jungle, sort of, except it's way up in the clouds and there's always this fog\u2014like rain, except it's not raining\u2014everything's all wet and swirly and tangled up and you can't see jack, you can't find your own pecker to piss with. Like you don't even have a body. Serious spooky. You just go with the vapors\u2014the fog sort of takes you in ... And the sounds, man. The sounds carry forever. You hear stuff nobody should overhear.\"\nSanders was quiet for a second, just working the yo-yo, then he smiled at me.\n\n\"So after a couple days the guys start hearing this real soft, kind of wacked-out music. Weird echoes and stuff. Like a radio or something, but it's not a radio, it's this strange gook music that comes right out of the rocks. Faraway, sort of, but right up close, too. They try to ignore it. But it's a listening post, right? So they listen. And every night they keep hearing that crazyass gook concert. All kinds of chimes and xylophones. I mean, this is wilderness\u2014no way, it can't be real\u2014but there it is, like the mountains are tuned in to Radio fucking Hanoi. Naturally they get nervous. One guy sticks Juicy Fruit in his ears. Another guy almost flips. Thing is, though, they can't report music. They can't get on the horn and call back to base and say, 'Hey, listen, we need some firepower, we got to blow away this weirdo gook rock band.' They can't do that. It wouldn't go down. So they lie there in the fog and keep their mouths shut. And what makes it extra bad, see, is the poor dudes can't horse around like normal. Can't joke it away. Can't even talk to each other except maybe in whispers, all hush-hush, and that just revs up the willies. All they do is listen.\"\n\nAgain there was some silence as Mitchell Sanders looked out on the river. The dark was coming on hard now, and off to the west I could see the mountains rising in silhouette, all the mysteries and unknowns.\n\"This next part,\" Sanders said quietly, \"you won't believe.\"\n\n\"Probably not,\" I said.\n\n\"You won't. And you know why?\" He gave me a long, tired smile. \"Because it happened. Because every word is absolutely dead-on true.\"\n\nSanders made a sound in his throat, like a sigh, as if to say he didn't care if I believed him or not. But he did care. He wanted me to feel the truth, to believe by the raw force of feeling. He seemed sad, in a way.\n\n\"These six guys,\" he said, \"they're pretty fried out by now, and one night they start hearing voices. Like at a cocktail party. That's what it sounds like, this big swank gook cocktail party somewhere out there in the fog. Music and chitchat and stuff. It's crazy, I know, but they hear the champagne corks. They hear the actual martini glasses. Real hoity-toity, all very civilized, except this isn't civilization. This is Nam.\n\n\"Anyway, the guys try to be cool. They just lie there and groove, but after a while they start hearing\u2014you won't believe this\u2014they hear chamber music. They hear violins and cellos. They hear this terrific mama-san soprano. Then after a while they hear gook opera and a glee club and the Haiphong Boys Choir and a barbershop quartet and all kinds of weird chanting and Buddha-Buddha stuff. And the whole time, in the background, there's still that cocktail party going on. All these different voices. Not human voices, though. Because it's the mountains. Follow me? The rock\u2014it's talking. And the fog, too, and the grass and the goddamn mongooses. Everything talks. The trees talk politics, the monkeys talk religion. The whole country. Vietnam. The place talks. It talks. Understand? Nam\u2014it truly talks.\n\n\"The guys can't cope. They lose it. They get on the radio and report enemy movement\u2014a whole army, they say\u2014and they order up the firepower. They get arty and gunships. They call in air strikes. And I'll tell you, they fuckin' crash that cocktail party. All night long, they just smoke those mountains. They make jungle juice. They blow away trees and glee clubs and whatever else there is to blow away. Scorch time. They walk napalm up and down the ridges. They bring in the Cobras and F-4s, they use Willie Peter and HE and incendiaries. It's all fire. They make those mountains burn.\n\n\"Around dawn things finally get quiet. Like you never even heard quiet before. One of those real thick, real misty days\u2014just clouds and fog, they're off in this special zone\u2014and the mountains are absolutely dead-flat silent. Like Brigadoon\u2014pure vapor, you know? Everything's all sucked up inside the fog. Not a single sound, except they still hear it.\n\n\"So they pack up and start humping. They head down the mountain, back to base camp, and when they get there they don't say diddly. They don't talk. Not a word, like they're deaf and dumb. Later on this fat bird colonel comes up and asks what the hell happened out there. What'd they hear? Why all the ordnance? The man's ragged out, he gets down tight on their case. I mean, they spent six trillion dollars on firepower, and this fatass colonel wants answers, he wants to know what the fuckin' story is.\n\"But the guys don't say zip. They just look at him for a while, sort of funny like, sort of amazed, and the whole war is right there in that stare. It says everything you can't ever say. It says, man, you got wax in your ears. It says, poor bastard, you'll never know\u2014wrong frequency\u2014you don't even want to hear this. Then they salute the fucker and walk away, because certain stories you don't ever tell.\"\n\nYou can tell a true war story by the way it never seems to end. Not then, not ever. Not when Mitchell Sanders stood up and moved off into the dark.\n\nIt all happened.\n\nEven now, at this instant, I remember that yo-yo. In a way, I suppose, you had to be there, you had to hear it, but I could tell how desperately Sanders wanted me to believe him, his frustration at not quite getting the details right, not quite pinning down the final and definitive truth.\n\nAnd I remember sitting at my foxhole that night, watching the shadows of Quang Ngai, thinking about the coming day and how we would cross the river and march west into the mountains, all the ways I might die, all the things I did not understand.\nLate in the night Mitchell Sanders touched my shoulder. \"Just came to me,\" he whispered. \"The moral, I mean. Nobody listens. Nobody hears nothin'. Like that fatass colonel. The politicians, all the civilian types. Your girlfriend. My girlfriend. Everybody's sweet little virgin girlfriend. What they need is to go out on LP. The vapors, man. Trees and rocks\u2014you got to listen to your enemy.\"\n\nAnd then again, in the morning, Sanders came up to me. The platoon was preparing to move out, checking weapons, going through all the little rituals that preceded a day's march. Already the lead squad had crossed the river and was filing off toward the west.\n\n\"I got a confession to make,\" Sanders said. \"Last night, man, I had to make up a few things.\"\n\n\"I know that.\"\n\n\"The glee club. There wasn't any glee club.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"No opera.\"\n\n\"Forget it, I understand.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but listen, it's still true. Those six guys, they heard wicked sound out there. They heard sound you just plain won't believe.\"\n\nSanders pulled on his rucksack, closed his eyes for a moment, then almost smiled at me. I knew what was coming.\n\n\"All right,\" I said, \"what's the moral?\"\n\n\"Forget it.\"\n\n\"No, go ahead.\"\n\nFor a long while he was quiet, looking away, and the silence kept stretching out until it was almost embarrassing. Then he shrugged and gave me a stare that lasted all day.\n\n\"Hear that quiet, man?\" he said. \"That quiet\u2014just listen. There's your moral.\"\n\nIn a true war story, if there's a moral at all, it's like the thread that makes the cloth. You can't tease it out. You can't extract the meaning without unraveling the deeper meaning. And in the end, really, there's nothing much to say about a true war story, except maybe \"Oh.\"\nTrue war stories do not generalize. They do not indulge in abstraction or analysis.\n\nFor example: War is hell. As a moral declaration the old truism seems perfectly true, and yet because it abstracts, because it generalizes, I can't believe it with my stomach. Nothing turns inside.\nIt comes down to gut instinct. A true war story, if truly told, makes the stomach believe.\n\nThis one does it for me. I've told it before\u2014many times, many versions\u2014but here's what actually happened.\n\nWe crossed that river and marched west into the mountains. On the third day, Curt Lemon stepped on a booby-trapped 105 round. He was playing catch with Rat Kiley, laughing, and then he was dead. The trees were thick; it took nearly an hour to cut an LZ for the dustoff.\n\nLater, higher in the mountains, we came across a baby VC water buffalo. What it was doing there I don't know\u2014no farms or paddies\u2014but we chased it down and got a rope around it and led it along to a deserted village where we set up for the night. After supper Rat Kiley went over and stroked its nose.\n\nHe opened up a can of C rations, pork and beans, but the baby buffalo wasn't interested.\nRat shrugged.\n\nHe stepped back and shot it through the right front knee. The animal did not make a sound. It went down hard, then got up again, and Rat took careful aim and shot off an ear. He shot it in the hindquarters and in the little hump at its back. He shot it twice in the flanks. It wasn't to kill; it was to hurt. He put the rifle muzzle up against the mouth and shot the mouth away. Nobody said much. The whole platoon stood there watching, feeling all kinds of things, but there wasn't a great deal of pity for the baby water buffalo. Curt Lemon was dead. Rat Kiley had lost his best friend in the world. Later in the week he would write a long personal letter to the guy's sister, who would not write back, but for now it was a question of pain. He shot off the tail. He shot away chunks of meat below the ribs. All around us there was the smell of smoke and filth and deep greenery, and the evening was humid and very hot. Rat went to automatic. He shot randomly, almost casually, quick little spurts in the belly and butt. Then he reloaded, squatted down, and shot it in the left front knee. Again the animal fell hard and tried to get up, but this time it couldn't quite make it. It wobbled and went down sideways. Rat shot it in the nose. He bent forward and whispered something, as if talking to a pet, then he shot it in the throat. All the while the baby buffalo was silent, or almost silent, just a light bubbling sound where the nose had been. It lay very still. Nothing moved except the eyes, which were enormous, the pupils shiny black and dumb.\n\nRat Kiley was crying. He tried to say something, but then cradled his rifle and went off by himself.\n\nThe rest of us stood in a ragged circle around the baby buffalo. For a time no one spoke. We had witnessed something essential, something brand-new and profound, a piece of the world so startling there was not yet a name for it.\n\nSomebody kicked the baby buffalo.\n\nIt was still alive, though just barely, just in the eyes.\n\n\"Amazing,\" Dave Jensen said. \"My whole life, I never seen anything like it.\"\n\n\"Never?\"\n\n\"Not hardly. Not once.\"\n\nKiowa and Mitchell Sanders picked up the baby buffalo. They hauled it across the open square, hoisted it up, and dumped it in the village well.\n\nAfterward, we sat waiting for Rat to get himself together.\n\n\"Amazing,\" Dave Jensen kept saying. \"A new wrinkle. I never seen it before.\"\n\nMitchell Sanders took out his yo-yo. \"Well, that's Nam,\" he said. \"Garden of Evil. Over here, man, every sin's real fresh and original.\"\n\nHow do you generalize?\n\nWar is hell, but that's not the half of it, because war is also mystery and terror and adventure and courage and discovery and holiness and pity and despair and longing and love. War is nasty; war is fun. War is thrilling; war is drudgery. War makes you a man; war makes you dead.\n\nThe truths are contradictory. It can be argued, for instance, that war is grotesque. But in truth war is also beauty. For all its horror, you can't help but gape at the awful majesty of combat. You stare out at tracer rounds unwinding through the dark like brilliant red ribbons. You crouch in ambush as a cool, impassive moon rises over the nighttime paddies. You admire the fluid symmetries of troops on the move, the harmonies of sound and shape and proportion, the great sheets of metal-fire streaming down from a gunship, the illumination rounds, the white phosphorus, the purply orange glow of napalm, the rocket's red glare. It's not pretty, exactly. It's astonishing. It fills the eye. It commands you. You hate it, yes, but your eyes do not. Like a killer forest fire, like cancer under a microscope, any battle or bombing raid or artillery barrage has the aesthetic purity of absolute moral indifference\u2014a powerful, implacable beauty\u2014and a true war story will tell the truth about this, though the truth is ugly.\nTo generalize about war is like generalizing about peace. Almost everything is true. Almost nothing is true. At its core, perhaps, war is just another name for death, and yet any soldier will tell you, if he tells the truth, that proximity to death brings with it a corresponding proximity to life. After a firefight, there is always the immense pleasure of aliveness. The trees are alive. The grass, the soil\u2014everything. All around you things are purely living, and you among them, and the aliveness makes you tremble. You feel an intense, out-of-the-skin awareness of your living self\u2014your truest self, the human being you want to be and then become by the force of wanting it. In the midst of evil you want to be a good man. You want decency. You want justice and courtesy and human concord, things you never knew you wanted. There is a kind of largeness to it, a kind of godliness. Though it's odd, you're never more alive than when you're almost dead. You recognize what's valuable. Freshly, as if for the first time, you love what's best in yourself and in the world, all that might be lost. At the hour of dusk you sit at your foxhole and look out on a wide river turning pinkish red, and at the mountains beyond, and although in the morning you must cross the river and go into the mountains and do terrible things and maybe die, even so, you find yourself studying the fine colors on the river, you feel wonder and awe at the setting of the sun, and you are filled with a hard, aching love for how the world could be and always should be, but now is not.\n\nMitchell Sanders was right. For the common soldier, at least, war has the feel\u2014the spiritual texture\u2014of a great ghostly fog, thick and permanent. There is no clarity. Everything swirls. The old rules are no longer binding, the old truths no longer true. Right spills over into wrong. Order blends into chaos, love into hate, ugliness into beauty, law into anarchy, civility into savagery. The vapors suck you in. You can't tell where you are, or why you're there, and the only certainty is overwhelming ambiguity.\n\nIn war you lose your sense of the definite, hence your sense of truth itself, and therefore it's safe to say that in a true war story nothing is ever absolutely true.\nOften in a true war story there is not even a point, or else the point doesn't hit you until twenty years later, in your sleep, and you wake up and shake your wife and start telling the story to her, except when you get to the end you've forgotten the point again. And then for a long time you lie there watching the story happen in your head. You listen to your wife's breathing. The war's over. You close your eyes. You smile and think, Christ, what's the point?\n\nThis one wakes me up.\n\nIn the mountains that day, I watched Lemon turn sideways. He laughed and said something to Rat Kiley. Then he took a peculiar half step, moving from shade into bright sunlight, and the booby-trapped 105 round blew him into a tree. The parts were just hanging there, so Dave Jensen and I were ordered to shinny up and peel him off. I remember the white bone of an arm. I remember pieces of skin and something wet and yellow that must've been the intestines. The gore was horrible, and stays with me. But what wakes me up twenty years later is Dave Jensen singing \"Lemon Tree\" as we threw down the parts.\n\nYou can tell a true war story by the questions you ask. Somebody tells a story, let's say, and afterward you ask, \"Is it true?\" and if the answer matters, you've got your answer.\n\nFor example, we've all heard this one. Four guys go down a trail. A grenade sails out. One guy jumps on it and takes the blast and saves his three buddies.\n\nIs it true?\n\nThe answer matters.\n\nYou'd feel cheated if it never happened. Without the grounding reality, it's just a trite bit of puffery, pure Hollywood, untrue in the way all such stories are untrue. Yet even if it did happen\u2014and maybe it did, anything's possible\u2014even then you know it can't be true, because a true war story does not depend upon that kind of truth. Absolute occurrence is irrelevant. A thing may happen and be a total lie; another thing may not happen and be truer than the truth. For example: Four guys go down a trail. A grenade sails out. One guy jumps on it and takes the blast, but it's a killer grenade and everybody dies anyway. Before they die, though, one of the dead guys says, \"The fuck you do that for?\" and the jumper says, \"Story of my life, man,\" and the other guy starts to smile but he's dead. That's a true story that never happened.\nTwenty years later, I can still see the sunlight on Lemon's face. I can see him turning, looking back at Rat Kiley, then he laughed and took that curious half step from shade into sunlight, his face suddenly brown and shining, and when his foot touched down, in that instant, he must've thought it was the sunlight that was killing him. It was not the sunlight. It was a rigged 105 round. But if I could ever get the story right, how the sun seemed to gather around him and pick him up and lift him high into a tree, if I could somehow re-create the fatal whiteness of that light, the quick glare, the obvious cause and effect, then you would believe the last thing Curt Lemon believed, which for him must've been the final truth.\n\nNow and then, when I tell this story, someone will come up to me afterward and say she liked it. It's always a woman. Usually it's an older woman of kindly temperament and humane politics. She'll explain that as a rule she hates war stories; she can't understand why people want to wallow in all the blood and gore. But this one she liked. The poor baby buffalo, it made her sad. Sometimes, even, there are little tears. What I should do, she'll say, is put it all behind me. Find new stories to tell.\nI won't say it but I'll think it.\n\nI'll picture Rat Kiley's face, his grief, and I'll think, You dumb cooze.\n\nBecause she wasn't listening.\n\nIt wasn't a war story. It was a love story.\n\nBut you can't say that. All you can do is tell it one more time, patiently, adding and subtracting, making up a few things to get at the real truth. No Mitchell Sanders, you tell her. No Lemon, no Rat Kiley. No trail junction. No baby buffalo. No vines or moss or white blossoms. Beginning to end, you tell her, it's all made up. Every goddamn detail\u2014the mountains and the river and especially that poor dumb baby buffalo. None of it happened. None of it. And even if it did happen, it didn't happen in the mountains, it happened in this little village on the Batangan Peninsula, and it was raining like crazy, and one night a guy named Stink Harris woke up screaming with a leech on his tongue. You can tell a true war story if you just keep on telling it.\n\nAnd in the end, of course, a true war story is never about war. It's about sunlight. It's about the special way that dawn spreads out on a river when you know you must cross the river and march into the mountains and do things you are afraid to do. It's about love and memory. It's about sorrow. It's about sisters who never write back and people who never listen.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/437458", "artist_names": "Boyz II Men", "full_title": "I Will

the limelight, pearly whites\nSaid her man get paper but he don't live right\nAll these emotions flowing inside the club\nDo you really want a thug or do ya want love?\nShe gets the paper when it's time to get it\nShe keep these clowns sinkin' like Chappaquiddick\nHoney smoke make you click, feel it in their throats\nNo joke, all these love letters they wrote\nBehind every playa is a true playette\nBounce you up outta there, push eject\nTaster's Choice, have her nice and moist\nOr play paper games and floss the Rolls Royce\n[Chorus]\nSomething like a phenomenon\nSomething like a

her mind\nDis a new lover when you know it's alright\nThat's on top, lap dance has got to stop\nYou play out your chick cause your game is hot\nI did it too, Italian iced my whole crew\nPiece banging on my chest 'til I'm black and blue\nYou beefin', yellin' on the cell of my 6\nYou reachin', then you hear the cordless click\nNow your club hopping, keep the Cristal poppin'\nUse my chips and take the next man shoppin'?\nHell no, must be out ya go- (out yo mind)\nGot you on your knees and your elbows each and every time\nThat's why I love you mami, you\nRun your mouth, throw your legs over the

brand new year, me and you can bring it in\nI was sick and tired of the freakin', night to morn'\nBonin' in the mirror with my Cubans on\nLet bygones be bygones, no more games\nHope all the chickenheads go up in flames\nNow we in the brand new mansion, with the lake in back\nGot it all figured out, mami, I like that\nCollect chips, cop his-and-her whips\nTo waste a quarter mil on clothes

Within seventy-two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed for Cuba. In the next few weeks, it became evident that Castro was forcing the boat owners to carry back with them not only their relatives but the dregs of his jail population. By the time the port was closed 125,000 'Marielitos' had landed in Florida. An estimated 25,000 had criminal records. This is the story of that minority -- those they call 'Los Bandidos.'\nThe prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a\nstiletto and in the empty black void we:\n\nCUT TO\n\nOpening Montage - Documentary Footage:\n2 THE DISEMBARKATION\nfrom the harbor in Mariel, Cuba.

One of them chuckles.\n\nMAN #l\nCarter should see this human right. He's good. He's very good. What do you say Harry?\n\nMAN #3\n(walking out)\nI... 'Freedomtown.' Let them take a look at him.

He takes the Baby Ruth out\nof Manny's hand, peels out the bar of chocolate, then\nreturns the empty wrapper to Manny,\n\nTONY\nSo what'd you tell them?\n\nMANNY\nI told them what you told me to tell them. I told them I was in sanitation in Cuba.\n\nTONY\nI didn't tell you sanitation.

TONY'S TENT - FREEDOMTOWN - NIGHT (SIX MONTHS LATER) 8\n\nA movie projector...\n...the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid. We're watching a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra-Madre. It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking to himself just before the bandits get him....\n\nThe rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,\nthe camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,\neyes in cat-like repose... to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an eleven year old, mouth hanging open.\n\nBOGART\nWhat a thing.\nConscience. Conscience.\nIf you believe you've got a conscience, it`ll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you've got one, what can it do to you?

Hunh? Like me....\n\nHe hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,\nimitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with\nzig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,\nTony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a\npop button pinned to his shirt that says \"Fuck Off and Die.\"\nAnd his English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence\nmore pronounced.\n\nTONY\n. . . don't trust nobody.\n\nMANNY\nYeah all that gold, hunh -- I guess you get so crazy you never trust nobody no more.\n\nTONY\nNever happen to me, Chico.

Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone\nrings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have\nnot yet seen in Tony.\n\nSomeone picks up the phone. An older woman's Voice. His\nexpression alters to uncertainty.\n\nVOICE\nYes? ...Hello? ...Who is this?\n\nTony changes his mind, hangs up. Pause. The faces of those\nin line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony\nignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his\npants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.\n\nHe walks a few beats, his eyes pensive. Then recognizes\nsomebody in another phone booth and goes over.\n\nAngel Fernandez has got the face of one, as he argues on\nthe phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a\nworn phone book in his hand.\n\nTONY\nAngel, how ya doin'?\n\nANGEL\nYou know how many goddamn Fernandezes are living in fucking Union City?

Like the man says, 'when you got 'em by the balls, their hearts and minds gonna follow' --hunh?\n\nTony winks and walks off.\n\nThe radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack. Tony loves the sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny and Angel.\n\nTONY\n(in awful imitation)\n'Oh yeah America!

You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.\n\nDoes it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head\npeeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.\n\nTONY\nWhat the hell's that for -- eating bugs? That's disgustin'.\n\nMANNY\nYou think so hunh? Well you don't know shit 'bout chicks Chico. When they see this, they know. They go crazy. They don't resist me.\n\nDoes it again. Tony tries but lacks the speed and agility, provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a shop window.\n\nMANNY\n(doing it again)\nTakes practice, mi sangre, but they just love it when you flop that pussy with it....\n\nTONY\nOooh... cono!

When he catches\nher eyes, he flicks his tongue.\n\nShe looks at him, confused, then back into the window.\nManny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.\n\nTony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber\nchild, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his\nown version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at\nhim puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now\nsmiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles\nand moves along.\n\nMeanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face\nand walks away.\n\nTony walks over to him, mocking.\n\nTONY\nPobre hijo de puta -- you got it all mixed up.\nThis country first you gotta get the money, then you get\nthe power and when you got the power, then you get the women -- and then, Chico, you got the world by the balls.

It combines the social functions of a family restaurant, cafe, tourist haunt and late-night watering hole for various beasts of prey.\n\nThe waitresses move like well-oiled troops along the paths\nto the kitchen, turning the tables at a speedy rate. The\ncamera following past the pots and the pans and the steam\nand the yelling cooks -- to the deepest, darkest recess of\nthis dungeon....\n\n. . . To reveal Tony Montana stubbing grease off the pots and\nManny Ray washing a stack of dishes. They're filthy and\nexhausted. A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes\nto the floor. A look between them suffices to tell us all.\n\nTONY\nYour big shot friend better come up with something soon.

Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish\nintelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing\nbetween words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor... with him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana. In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline, flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.\n\nMANNY\n(leaning in the window)\nHey Omar, Waldo, coma esta... my friend I told you about. Tony Montana... Omar Suarez, Waldo Rojas....\n\nWaldo mumbles something indistinct, Omar just stares briefly as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly.

He's in his forties, sports shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on his face, like Omar; he's good natured, a nice guy, he smiles.\n\nTOAD\nHey, oye amigo....\n\nSpreading his arms in such a fashion to indicate he's clean.\n\n35 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nTony, stepping into the conventionally tasteless orange and\nblue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture indicating he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not meant to be a body search.\n\nTONY\n(as he steps in)\nHow you doing amigo...?\n\nThe other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark\nColombian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails, and short boy-cut hair, \"The Lizard\"; she's tinier than the Toad, about five-two.\n\nThe Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.\n\nTONY\n(checking out the room)\nMind leaving the door open so my brothers know everything's okay... okay?\n\nToad shrugs and readjusts, leaving it open a few inches,\nthe conversation clipped and nervous throughout the scene.\n\nTOAD\nSure, no problem... This is Marta.\n\nTONY\nHello, Marta.\nShe nods woodenly, stays across the room. Behind her, the\ntelevision set is on to the Cable Newswatch. The protagonists\nintermittently flick their eyes to it, soothing the tension.\n\nTOAD\nI'm Hector...\n\nPause.\n\nTONY\nYeah. I'm Tony. So Omar says you're okay.\n\nTOAD\nYeah, Omar's okay.\n\nTONY\nYou know Omar.\n\nTOAD\nOmar, yeah, I talk to him on the phone.\n\nTONY\nOkay...\n\nTOAD\nOkay... so you got the money?\n\nTONY\nYeah, you got the stuff?\n\nTOAD\nSure I got the stuff, but I don't\ngot it right here with me. I got it\nclose by.\n\nTONY\nYeah well I don't got it either, I\ngot it close by, too.\n\nTOAD\nWhere, in the parking lot?\n\nTONY\nNo. How far's your stuff?\n\nTony paces back towards, the door casually, to check Angel\nout... The Lizard staring at him...\n\nTOAD\nNot far.\n\nPause. Everything seems okay.\n\nTONY\nSo what do we do, walk in and start over?\n\nTOAD\n(changes subject)\nWhere you from?\n\nTony's eyes check out the bathroom.\n\nTONY\nWhat fuckin' difference does it make where I'm from?\n\nTOAD\nI like to get to know who I do business with.\n\nIt's like he's stalling for time. The Lizard has made a\nmove somewhere off-center and is now sitting on the bed,\ncoiled and always watching.\n\nTONY\nYou get to know me when you start doing business and not fucking around, Hector.\n\nTOAD\nHey I'm just a friendly guy, maybe you don't...\n\nTONY\nOkay, what's the stall here? Your guy late or something?\n\n36 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThere's suddenly a door slamming somewhere outside, then\ncommotion.\n\nANGEL\nTony!\n\nTony goes for his cheap handgun when he hears a frightening\nfemale shriek, like a bird.\n\nLIZARD\n(slang Spanish)\nDon't! Get up! Now shithead!\n\nShe's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to shoot.\n\nThe Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back, approaches Tony. Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more\nColumbians, \"The Kids\".\n\nThey slam the door, both carrying Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little piranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard in fast Columbese slang.\n\nAs Toad strips the handgun from Tony:\n\nTONY\nFrog face, you just fucked up. You steal from me, you're dead.\n\nToad shrugs, he couldn't care less.\n\nTOAD\nYeah, okay, you gonna give me the cash or am I gonna kill your brother first? 'Fore I kill you?\n\nTONY\nTry sticking your head up your ass.\nSee if it fits.\n\nToad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto\ntaped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something\nin hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel\ninto the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.\nEven more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now\npulls out of the suitcase under the bed. Toad begins\nassembling it as Lizard, still covering Tony with her gun, completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on the television set. The news, ironically not in Miami, is about a drug-related triple-homicide.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n37 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\n\nChi-Chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan, parked across\nthe street. Manny paces outside the car, glances.\n\n38 EXT.

TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nAngel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the bathtub. Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.\n\nTony, covered by the two kids, watches from the lip of the\nbathroom. He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their\npistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.\nAngel looks at Tony; the eyes between them steady. They're\ndead and they know it.\n\nToad, well-prepared, connects a voltage adapter and extension cord.\n\nTOAD\n(to Tony)\nYou watch what happens to your friend okay? If you don't want this to happen to you, you get the money.\n\nLizard reenters the room, shakes her head at the Toad who\nnods and turns on the whirring machine.\n\nThe Toad smiles amiably and angles the chainsaw slowly\ntowards Angel.\n\nThe two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at his\nbrains... Off-camera, we know what's happening as we hear the chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.\n\nLizard has no expression on her face. The machine cuts off.\n\nThe Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his shirt, examining his first cut like a butcher. He glances at Tony.\n\nTOAD\nNow the leg, hunh?\n\nA brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.\n\nCUT TO\n\n41 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nManny, definitely suspecting something now, moves with\nChi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel. They\nsignal and separate.\n\nCUT TO\n\n42 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY\nThe Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.\n\nTony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily dotting his eyes.\n\nTOAD\nOkay, my 'caracortada', you can die too. Makes no difference to me.\n\nHe nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel\nlying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of\nhis blood, piss dead.\n\nCUT TO\n\n43 EXT.

Everything happens very fast now.\n\nManny is at the lip of the bathroom, he fires and hits kid\none, who is turning, in the neck.\n\nTony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling across the bathroom.\n\nThe Toad, chainsaw in hand, slashes at Manny.\n\nManny fires a burst into him and the Toad crashes backwards.\n\nManny now spins into a wall, hit in the side.\n\nThe Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at\nhim. In the background, the window simultaneously blows out as Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.\n\nIn sharp foreground, the Lizard crumples forward on her knees, foaming blood.\n\nTony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the stock of his own Ingram.\n\nIn the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with strength, he tears out the motel room door hysterical, gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.\n\nChi-Chi, climbing through the window, fires at him.\n\nMeanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces\na knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine pistol.\n\nHe blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.\n\nTony, yelling, whirls after the Toad.\n\nTONY\nI got him!\n\nManny, holding his side, empties his pistol on kid one, who is still twitching.\n\nChi-Chi sees Angel, gags.\n\nCUT TO\n46 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY 46\nThe senior citizens, playing Mahjong on the porch, mutter\nin astonishment, as the Toad staggers out into the parking lot, blood flying, chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.\n\nTheir eyes follow.\n\nAs Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.\nThere's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all\nthat counts. He stands behind the Toad.\n\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nYour turn, cabron!\n\nThe Toad whips around to the voice, eyes stark with terror.\n\nTony empties the clip into the Toad, blowing him apart.\n\nThe bystanders just stare, stunned by the ferocity. Then\nan old lady faints.\n\nThe Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony\nturns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his\naudience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance\nand the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identification.\n\nCUT TO\n\n47 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\nTony intersects Manny holding his side, with Chi-Chi.\n\nTONY\nManny, you okay?\n\nManny nods.\n\nTONY\nChi-Chi, get the car. Fast!\n\nCHI-CHI\nSi!\n\n48 INT. TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM\nTony strides into the shambles of Room 9, past the bodies\nand busted furniture to the suitcase on the bed from which\nthe Lizard pulled the chainsaw. The TV news still plays in the corner.\n\nInside are several kilo-sized stacks of cocaine.\n\nHe shuts the suitcase, exits, stops, looks in the bathroom at the corpse of Angel off-camera. He goes, stoops, brings Angel's Change charm into our view, fingers it, tosses it back in the tub. He goes.\n\nCUT TO\n49 EXT. SUN-RAY MOTEL - DAY\n\nChi-Chi has the sedan waiting in the parking lot. Tony\nhurries out, jumps in, the car speeding off. (Pisalo hasta la tabla -- Step on it.)\n\nPast the senior citizens who are retreating inside their\nrooms.\n\nThe camera swinging to hold on the blue and black Monte Carlo disappearing into the traffic of the Strip as two cop cars\ncome screaming past them from the opposite direction.\n\nCUT TO\n50 EXT.

He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.\n\nLOPEZ\nHow ya doing, Tony? Glad to meet you. How 'bout a drink?\n\nTONY\nMr. Lopez... real pleasure.\n\nLOPEZ\nCall me Frank, Tony. Everybody calls me Frank. My Little League team, even the prosecutors 'round town, they all call me Frank.\n\nTONY\nOkay Frank.\n\nFrank shakes hands with Manny.\n\nLOPEZ\nHowya doing?\n\nMANNY\n(awed)\n...Fine yeah.\n\nTONY\nManny Ray, he was with us on the job.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Manny)\nI hear you caught one?\n\nManny shrugs, works his arm, showing us the wound doesn't bother him too much.\n\nMANNY\nJust the flesh. Went right through.\n\nLOPEZ\n(heading for the bar)\nYeah, Omar here tells me good things about you boys.\n\nTONY\n(glances at Omar)\nYeah. Omar's terrific.\n\nLOPEZ\nNot to mention of course the nice job you guys did for me on that Commie sonufabitch Emilio Rebenga.\n\nTONY\nYou don't have to mention it. That was fun.\n\nLOPEZ\n(smiles, likes the kid's balls)\nScotch? Gin? Rum?\n\nTONY\nGin's fine.\n\nLOPEZ\n(pouring)\nYeah, I need a guy with steel in his balls. I need him close to me, a guy like you Tony -- and your compadre here.\n\nTONY\nYeah... well.\n\nStill a little overwhelmed by the opulence of the place, his clothes feeling narrow and cheap on him, Tony steps forward and puts the suitcase up on the bar with the gin, which Lopez passes to him, eyeing the suitcase.\n\nTONY\n...that's it. That's the two keys. Angel died 'cause of this shit. And here's the money.\n(produces the money)\nIt's my gift to you -- from me.\n\nPause. Lopez shakes his head, sighs.\n\nLOPEZ\nIt's too bad about your friend, Tony, if people'd do business the right way, there'd be no fuckups like this....\n\nHe glances hard at Omar who squirms.\n\nWithout opening it, Lopez signals the bodyguard who takes\nthe suitcase and the money from under Tony's nose.\n\nLOPEZ\nDon't think I don't appreciate this gesture, Tony. You find in this business, you stay loyal you move up and you move up fast. Salud!\n\nThey drink the toast.

Go get her, will you, Ernie?\n\nThe big bodyguard exits smoothly.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to the others)\nThe broad spends half her life dressing, the other half undressing.\n\nTONY\nI guess you gotta catch her in the middle, hunh?\n\nLopez laughs.\n\nLOPEZ\nYeah. When she's not looking. What do you say guys, to a little food?\n(finishes his drink at his impatient pace)\n\nTONY\nYeah sure, I could eat a horse.\n\nERNIE\nHere she comes, Mr. Lopez.\n\nTONY looks up, his eyes tumbling on the most beautiful blonde he's ever seen. The lady, is coming down the glassed-in elevator, adjusting her $10,000 Yves St. Laurent burgundy dinner dress.\n\nLOPEZ\nOooh sweetheart, you look like a million bucks.\n\nShe doesn't answer, her eyes flicking disinterestedly over to Tony and Manny, knowing what the evening's going to be and not too happy about it.\n\n**ALTERNATIVE**\nLOPEZ\nWhere you been baby, it's ten o'clock, I'm hungry.\n\nELVIRA\nYou're always hungry, you should try starving.\n\nLopez laughs.\n\nLOPEZ\nI want you to meet a friend of mine.\nTony Montana...

I got nothing but friends.\n\nELVIRA\nYou never know, do you? Maybe the catcher on your Little League team.\n\nNeatly avoiding his intended smooch, she slips by him towards the door, her throat flashing a $20,000 strip of jewelry.\n\nELVIRA\nCome on, Frank, let's go.\n\nTracking a cool, polished hauteur, she exits the apartment.\n\nLopez, after a pause, snaps at his men.\n\nLOPEZ\nOkay, let's go.\n\nCUT TO\n54 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nWe know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them\nout of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis, Lamborghinis and Corniches in a long snaking line down the driveway. Single girls in high-collared silver lame jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening tents back and forth across the entry doors, rich young coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in appreciation. Brain drain.\n\n55 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nThe interior is built like three or four plush apartments that run together on three separate levels with imaginative angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band, hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games, computers and a restaurant. It's a lavish fun spot that will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven and nighttime capital of South America.\n\nThe crowd, a combination of Caucasian and Latin, is mostly\nyoung, rich and happy and a lot of them coked; the girls, upperclass in sleek dresses, trim figures, heels, hats, sensuous bodies, yell as they dance to a black American music beat, \"Celebrating\" or \"Partying Down Tonight\".\n\nThe waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel\nhats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose\nand high heels.\n\nRich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their\nnecks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.\n\nDown at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and\ntough-looking tank tops with \"Motherfuckah\" and \"Fuck Me\"\nwritten on them. Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to pick one of them up.\n\nMANNY\nSo whaddaya say, hunh?\n\nHe flashes his tongue. She looks at him, amused.\n\nCHICK\nYou got a buck?\n\nMANNY\nSure I got a buck, whaddaya think I am, poor?\n\nCHICK\n(indicates the machine)\nPut it in, let's play.\n\nMANNY\nI had other things in mind.\n\nCHICK\nYou check out on this and we'll talk about other things.\n\nMANNY\n(looks off, concerned, then confronts the complex machine)\nFuck, how do you play this thing?\n\nCUT TO\n56 INT. BABYLON CLUB 56\nFrank Lopez, intoxicated, takes his heart pill with a slug\nof champagne. He sits next to Tony, who is agog at all this wealth. Omar and Ernie look on. Elvira is in conversation with a girl friend who has stopped by. They're sitting at the best table in the place, finishing up a giant meal. The empty spot belongs to Manny.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Tony)\nOver there that's Ronnie Echeverria.\nHim and his brother Miguel, they got a big distribution set-up here to Houston and Tucson....\n\nTheir point of view -- Ronnie Echevarria, powerful, competent looking man in conversation with a party of people.\n\nLOPEZ\nThat guy there, in the purple shirt -- Gaspar Gomez. Bad news. Stone killer there ever was one. Stay away.\n\nTheir point of view -- Gaspar Gomez at a table with another\nguy and gorgeous woman.\n\nLOPEZ\n...the fat guy, with the chicas is Nacho Contreras -- El Gordo. Wouldn't know it to look at him but he's got more cash than anybody in here. A real haza....\n\nTheir point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas.\n\nLOPEZ\n. ..you know what a haza is, Tony?\n\nTONY\n'Haza'? No Frank, what's a haza?\n\nLOPEZ\nIt's Yiddish for pig. It's a guy he's got more'n what he needs, so he don't fly straight anymore, y'know. That's the problem in this business, Tony, there's too many 'hazas' and they're the ones you got to watch out for. If they can fuck you outta an extra dime, they'll rip you and flip you and then fuck you with a stick for the pure pleasure of it. See it all comes down to one thing, Tony boy, never forget it! Lesson number one -- don't underestimate the other guy's greed.\n\nELVIRA\nLesson number two -- don't get high on your own supply.\n\nThe girl friend has departed and Elvira turns her attention back to them, bored.\n\nLOPEZ\nThat's right. Course not everybody follows the rules.\n(eyeing Elvira)\n\nHEAD WAITER\nThere you go, Mr. Lopez.\n\nHe's popped the champagne cork and pours Dom Perignon for Lopez.\n\nLOPEZ\nGive it to everybody and bring another, willya Jack?\n\nHead Waiter nods.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Tony)\nFive hundred fifty dollars for this bottle Tony, what do you think of that, hunh?

BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nA Man passes the table. Lopez calls out.\n\nLOPEZ\nHey, George -- buddy.\n\nMAN\nHey, Frank.. -how's the case coming?\n\nThe Man's eyes thread the table. He looks sharp, heavy-lidded, cigarette-eyed, his voice a hoarse croak, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, his manner cool but amicable with Lopez. This is George Sheffield, Miami lawyer.\n\nLOPEZ\nOy, I shoulda come to you 'stead of that putz, Neufeld.\n\nSHEFFIELD\nJack's a good lawyer. I taught him everything he knows.\n\nLOPEZ\nYeah, almost everything.\n\nSHEFFIELD\n(to Elvira)\nElvira, you look terrific...\n(to all)\nEnjoy yourselves.\n\nHe ambles off.\n\nLOPEZ\n. . . best goddamn lawyer in Miami. Cost a brick to pick up a phone.\n\nTony looking off at him, remembering it.\n\nLOPEZ\n(raising his champagne glass)\nSo... here's to old friends...and new friends.\n\nThey toast, Tony tasting it like it was Holy Water.\n\nLOPEZ\nWell, Tony?\n\nTONY\nHey, yeah, you're not kidding, this is good stuff, Frank.\n\nLopez laughs, likes the kid, tweaks him on the cheek.\n\nLOPEZ\n(checking Tony's threads)\nYeah, get you some new clothes, some $500 suits, you'll look real sharp.

I'd rather have a heart attack.\n\nELVIRA\n(rising)\nDon't foam into the Dom Perignon.\n\nGlancing at Omar, sitting there obediently. Her eyes say forget it.\n\nELVIRA\n(to Tony)\nHow about you?\n\nTony nods sure, looks at his boss.\n\nLOPEZ\n(waves)\nGo on!\n\nThey go.\n\n58 INT. BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT\nIt's interesting to watch Tony walk to the floor, leading Elvira. It's not so much an act of walking as it is an act of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody off that gets in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight dead line, eyes forward. It's not that he doesn't see the people he bumps off, it's that he couldn't care less.\n\nLOPEZ\n(to Omar)\nWhat do you think?\n\nOMAR\nI think he's a fucking peasant.\n\nLOPEZ\nYeah -- but you get guys like that on your side, they break their backs for you.\n\nCUT TO\n59 INT.

I'm a political refugee here.\n\nELVIRA\nOh, part of the Cuban crime wave?\n\nTony, pissed, bangs once more into the elderly couple.\nThe man stops dancing, looks at him exasperated but Tony\ndoesn't see.\n\nTONY\nWhatta you talking crazy for, whatsa matter with you?\n\nELVIRA\n(interrupting)\nI'm sorry.

You got a nice face, you got great legs, you got the fancy clothes and you got this look in your eyes like you haven't been fucked good in a year. What's the problem, baby?\n\nElvira laughs at him, furious.\n\nELVIRA\nYou know you're even stupider than you look.

DOWNTOWN MIAMI - SUNNY DAY - TWO MONTHS LATER\nThe new Miami is rising ubiquitously-above Biscayne Bay,\nthe camera moving past blossoming Skyscrapers, workmen,\nhuge cranes, glass, mirrors booming upwards into a beautiful blue Florida sky, fleeced with perfectly white clouds... past a giant billboard:\n\nHOW ABOUT A MILLION DOLLAR LOAN?\nCOME TALK TO US...\nAT THE BANCO DE MIAMI...\nTODAY!\n\nPast banks of glass (Caribank, Ranco de Venezuela, Amerifirst)...\n\nInsert a car sticker going by with the image of the\nAmerican flag and the reminder: \"Will the last American\nleaving Miami please bring the flag?\"\n\nTony and Manny, on a shopping spree, bop along an incredibly luxurious shopping mall lined with the latest stores, fashions, escalators, music, tropical plants, etc -- a warm womb-like plastic heaven.\n\nTONY\nI shoulda been here 10 years age man. This town's like a big pussy dyin' to be fucked, Paradise, rr.an, paradise.I coulda been a millionaire by now. Get my own golf course, a boat...\n\nMANNY\nI want a line of bluejeans with my name on the\nchicks' asses.\n\nTONY\nYeah, we gotta make some moves on our own Manny,\nWe never gonna score the big money working for Frank.\n\nMANNY\nFrank's okay.\n\nTONY\nYeah -- cause he buys you a suit?

You wanna score one of these chicks, watch. Mira!\n\nHe wiggles his tongue up and down, fast like a small\nwhirring motor part, then slips it back into his mouth in\nthe flick of an eye.\n\nTONY\n...the fuck was that?\n\nMANNY\nYou didn't see it? You weren't looking. Hey you gotta watch for it.\n\nDoes it again, quickly; it looks like a baby robin's head\npeeking out of a nest in his teeth, then it's gone.\n\nTONY\nWhat the hell's that for -- eating bugs?

How 'bout that one?\n\nPointing to a tall, cool blonde across the avenue.\n\nMANNY\nNo problem.\n\nEXT. MIAMI SHOPPING STREET - DAY.\n\nTony walks right out into the avenue, sticking out his arms and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't give a shit.\n\nTONY\nCome on!\n\nManny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a\ncar screeching to a halt in front of him.\n\nTONY\n(points)\nOkay Rober Retfor, strut your stuff.\n\nThe blonde has paused to look in a shop window.\n\nManny stops alongside, -pretends to look. When he catches\nher eyes, he flicks his tongue.\n\nShe looks at him, confused, then back into the window.\nManny looks back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.\n\nTony, exiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber\nchild, four, toddling along with it's mom. He makes his\nown version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at\nhim puzzled. Tony produces another face. The kid now\nsmiles. The mother looks over. Tony shrugs. She smiles and moves along.\n\nMeanwhile, Manny has moved close to the blonde and suggests something, his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It takes a moment, then the blonde socks him across the face and walks away.\n\nTony walks up to him, mocking.\n\nTONY\nI'm telling you man you got it- all mixed up.\nThis country first, you gotta get the money; then you get the power, and when you got the power, then you get the women -- then, chico, you got the world by the balls.

TONY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - SOUTHWEST MIAMI - LATE DAY\nThe house, bathed by a torpid setting sun amicable to lizards and Spanish moss, sits undistinguished and without shielding trees in the midst of a lower middle class neighborhood with look-alike yards and streets without people.\n\n66 INT. TONY'S CADILLAC SEDAN - SIMULTANEOUS DAY\nFrom his battered Monte Carlo across the curb, Tony, spruced\nup and nervous in a new suit, gets out carrying a bag of\ngifts. Manny is at the wheel, curious.\n\nTONY\nBe back in an hour okay.\n\nMANNY\nOkay... be cool.\n\nTony approaches the house, with the paper bag held high against his chest.\n\n67 EXT./INT.

Mother looks behind her.\nShe opens the door, looks back as if she has no choice.\nHe steps in. He looks.\n\n68 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\nThe interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled\nwith religious objects from macumba and waist-high black\nJesus statues in various corners. The floor is without rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.\n\nStepping forward to the center of the living room like a cautious cat is his nineteen-year-old sister Gina. Their eyes lock.\n\nTONY\n(moved)\nHi Gina...\n\nGINA\nTony?\n\nShe looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,\ncurly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and\nlarge-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.\n(She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in\nTony's possession.)\n\nTONY\n(covering his unwanted emotion)\nYeah, look at you, you're beautiful... what's it been seven years? Last time I saw you, you looked like a boy. Now look at you, you got great big eyes just like me! Yeah, so....\n\nHe holds out a wrapped gift towards her, about to give it.\n\nTONY\nI got this for you, no big deal but....\n\nGINA\nOh Tony!\n\nGina suddenly. explodes across the room and rushes into his\narms, grasping him fiercely.\n\nGINA\n...it's you!\n\nTony, over her shoulder, catches his mother's eyes boring into him stonily.\n\nGINA\nI never thought I'd see you again -- never!\n\nTony, over her shoulder, opens the gift.\n\nTONY\nHey pussycat, c'mon -- you think they can keep a guy like me down?\n\nDisengaging gently, he holds up the contents of the gift box in font of her. It's a beautiful diamond locket to wear around her neck. Her eyes open wide.\n\nTONY\n...Yeah for you...and look -- here.\nWhat I got written on it....\n\"To Gina From Tony. Always.\"\n\nGINA\nIt's beautiful Tony, it's just beautiful....\n\nThe mother is amazed at the cost of the gift. Tony pulls\nout another present, for her.\n\nTONY\n...for you too Mama, look....\n\nMoving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an\nexquisite pearl necklace. She stares at it, doesn't take it. Gina comes over, takes it for her.\n\nGINA\nIt's beautiful... Mama,\n(offers it, an unspoken 'why don't you take it?')\n\nMama doesn't. Gina puts it away with her own.\n\nTONY\n(holding Gina by the shoulder, making light of it)\nWell anyway, here we are hunh? The three musketeers! We made it to America hunh? Let's toast!\n\nTossing the empty package aside, he pulls the last gift -- a\nbottle of champagne.\n\nTONY\nOye ! To America!\n(singing)\n'America. America....'\n\nCUT TO\n69 INT. TONY'S MOTHER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\nMama, with things on her mind, is silently cooking a lunch,\nas Tony and Gina finish the champagne at the kitchen table.\n\nGINA\n. . .So Mama's still at the factory and I'm working part-time at a beauty parlor. I'm doing hair. Remember Hiram Gonzalez? His father had the babershop?\n\nTony nods.\n\nGINA\nIt's his place.

I didn't bring\nup my kid sister to work in no hair\nshop....\n\nMama looks over at him on the words \"bring up\" and he\ncatches her look.\n\nTONY\n...and Mama don't have to sew in no factory.\n\nHe pulls out a bundle of cash, fifties and hundreds, and\nstarts peeling them off on the table. Mama stops working,\nlooks.\n\nTONY\n(to Mama as he counts)\nYeah, your son's made it Mama, he's a success. I wanted to surprise\nyou. That's how come I didn't show my face around before. I wanted you to see what a good boy I been.\n\nPushes a thousand dollar stack towards her.\n\nTONY\nThat's a thousand dollars right there, Mama -- for you.\n\nShe approaches it cautiously, her fingers riffling the\nbills, then looks back at her son.\n\nMAMA\nWho'd you kill for this Tony?\n\nGINA\n(aghast)\nMama!\n\nTONY\nI didn't kill nobody Mama,\n(lying)\n\nMAMA\nNo? What are you doing now -- banks or is it still bodegas, you and the others?\n\nTONY\nC'mon Mama. Things are different.\nI'm working with this anti-Castro group.\nI'm an organizer now, we get a lotta political contributions....\n\nMAMA\nSure you do Tony -- with a gun sticking in somebody's face. All we read about in the papers is the animals like you and the killings, what about the Cubans who come here and work hard and make a good name for themselves? What about....\n\nGINA\n(springing to her feet)\nWhat are you saying Mama! He's your son!\n\nMAMA\nSon? I wish I had one. He's a bum! He was a bum then and he's a\nbum now!\n(to Tony, she's worked up like a madwoman now)\nWho do you think you are, we haven't heard a word from you in five years and you suddenly show up here and throw some money around and you think you can get my respect? You think you can buy me with jewelry?\nYou think you can come into my house with your hotshot clothes and your gutter manners and make fun of....\n\nTONY\nHey Mama, come on, you don't know what you're talking about.....\n\nMAMA\n(continuing)\nNo, no, that's not the way I am Tony and that's not the way I --\n(emphasizing it)\nI raised Gina to be. You're not going to destroy her. I don't need your money, thanks. I work for my living -- and I don't want you in this house anymore and I don't want you around Gina. So leave us alone... go on, get out! And take this lousy\nmoney with you, it stinks!\n\nShe casts the bundle of bills back across the table at him\nlike dead lettuce.\n\nA silence. Tony sits there livid, soothing his scar, about to explode, but doesn't. Gina mutters something in the silence.\n\nGINA\nOh Mama... why do you got to spoil it for everybody.\n(to Tony)\nI'm sorry Tony, I....\n\nTony nods his head at his mother.\n\nTONY\n(gently)\nOkay, Mama, okay....\nCUT TO\n\n70 EXT.

He was a bum!\n\nGINA\n(continuing)\n. . . she's got a lot of hate in her Tony, she's proud, you got to understand that?\n\nTONY\n(making light of it now)\nHey it's okay, it's Mama, what do you want, she's Old World.\n\nGINA\nTony, I know you did some bad things\nback then. The Army, I know you got into some trouble.\n\nTONY\nCommunists you know, they're always trying to tell you what to do.\n\nGINA\nMama, she doesn't understand-- but I just want you to know, y'know, I don't care. Five years, ten years, it doesn't matter how long you been away, you're my blood. Always.\n\nPause. She stares intently at him, emphasizing it.\n\nTONY\nHey I know... I know.\n\nShe gives him a soft kiss. He takes out his money roll.\n\nTONY\nSay, I want you to keep this for yourself. Okay? Help Mama out, but don't tell her I gave you this, okay?\n\nShe hesitates... He nudges her on the cheek and slaps the whole wad into her palm.\n\nTONY\nGo on! Go out and have some fun, what the hell? You gonna beat yourself to death at nineteen, pussycat like you?\n\nHe gets in the car. She peers in.\n\nGINA\nYou can come by the shop y'know, any afternoon, I'll be there okay?\n\nHer eyes fall on Manny at the wheel.\nHe smiles back with charm.\n\nGina's eyes pause on him, then withdraw.

COCAINE LAB - BOLIVIA - DAY 93\nSubtitle appears:\n\nCOCHABAMBA, BOLIVA\nAlejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy\nhair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a\ncasual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.\n\nOn his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with \"Alex' written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the continual excitement of his toys and his money.\n\nAccompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense\nvenomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the\nlook of death in an unsmiling face. He is always in\nproximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person\nor persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte\nposition, his eyes swiveling to stare down the person who\nmight glance at him. He is a continual source of tension\nunderplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar\nwho is insecure to begin with.\n\nSosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing\nlab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with massive iron\nkettles bubbling with coca paste... across to a row of ovens\nwhere the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians\nworking there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey\" as he passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his vineyard.\n\nSOSA\nSo this and my other factory can guarantee production of 200\nkilos refined every month of the year. Problem is, I have no steady\nmarket. Some months I can't get rid of fifty keys, other months I have to do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh? Nobody can run a business that way ---\n\nOMAR\nI know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got the same problems up in Miami, the demand varies for us too, month to month...\n\nSosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on. In his\nskinny suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his\nnervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.\n\nTony, awed by the scope of it all, follows along, stops to\nlook at a sample of the dried coke.\nThe Shadow stops, eyeballs him.\n\nTony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then\nsamples the coke off his thumb into his nose.\nPause. His expression says I like it. He moves on.\nThe Shadow moves with him.\n\nSOSA\n(meanwhile)\n...Basically what I'm looking for is somebody to share the risks with me, somebody in the States who might guarantee me something like -- say 150 kilos a month.\n\nOMAR\nThat's a big commitment Mr. Sosa. It's too bad Frank's not here. Something like that you should talk to him.\n\nSOSA\nYes, it would've been nice if he could have come.\n\nTONY\n(cutting in)\nand he'd like meeting you too Mr. Sosa. But with his trial coming up y'know, it's not so easy for him to slip outta the country right now, y'understand?\n\nSOSA\n(taking the measure of Tony, sarcastic)\nSo he sent you?\n\nTONY\nYeah, something like that. You sure got good stuff in there Mr. Sosa -- class A shit.\n\nLooking over the laboratory like it was his.\nOmar glances at him, annoyed.\n\nSOSA\nWe'll talk at my house. Shall we go...\n\nCUT TO\n94 INT. SOSA VILLA - BOLIVIA - DAY 94\nThe camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains\nto a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings\nfrom the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.\nAt the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony. The Shadow sits impassively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.\nHe eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, constantly hanging dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).\n\nSOSA\n(to Omar)\n...say Lopez guarantees me 150 keys a month for a year, and he picks it up down here, I could sell it to him for as little as 7000 a kilo. You cannot do better than that.\n\nOMAR\nWell, we do that, we gotta take the\nrisk of moving it. Also we'd be cutting out the Columbians. You\nknow what that means?\n\nTONY\nThat means we gotta go to war with\n`em.\nlooks over at him, not quite knowing yet what to make\nSosa\nof this guy.\nSOSA\nWhen we cut out the Colombians we take risks -- on both sides.\n\nTONY\nSplit the risk. Guarantee your delivery as far as Panama.\n\nSOSA\nPanama? Risky? It costs me more. There I'd sell maybe 13.5 a key.\n\nTONY\n13.5! What are you nuts? We still gotta take the shit to Florida. You\nknow what that's like these days?\nThey got the Navy all over the fuckin' place. They got frogmen, they got EC2s with satellite tracking shit in 'em, they got fuckin' Bell 209 assault choppers up the ass, we're losing one out of every nine loads. It's no duckwalk for us anymore, y'know. Forget it.\n\nOmar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.\n\nSOSA\nWhat do you suggest is a fair...?\nExcuse me.\n\nInterrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly\nappears at the door, apparently with a message. Sosa waves\nhim in.\n\nThe black aide -- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man\nwith academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair\non a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he approaches, he glances down the table, his eyes falling briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters -- just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the same stony, loyal expression.\n\nSosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.\nA beat.\nHe whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.\nThen he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.\nSosa glances at his gold Rolex.\n\nOMAR\n(meanwhile, in a whisper to Tony)\nShaddup willya Montana, I'm doing the talking here!\n\nTony shrugs.\n\nSOSA\nWhere were we?\n\nTONY\nPanama. You're looking for a partner, right?\n\nOmar shoots a poisonous glance at Tony.\n\nSOSA\n...something like that.\n(chuckles)\n\nOMAR\nLook Mr. Sosa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. I'm down on Frank's authority to buy 200 keys, that's it, that's my limit. I got no right to negotiate for Frank Lopez on anything larger than that. So why don't we...\n\nTONY\nHey Omar, why don't you let the man finish, hunh? Let him propose his proposition.\n\nOMAR\nHey Montana, you got no authority here, okay! I started you in this business, all right, so shut the fuck UP!\n\nTONY\n(shrugs)\nFrank'll love it. Don't worry about it.\n\nOMAR\nThat's up to Frank -- not you.\n\nHe looks embarrassed at Sosa who has been watching, sensing\n-- also an advantage in the split.\n\nOMAR\nI'm sorry about this, Mr. Sosa...\n\nSOSA\nIt's all right. Maybe your partner's right. Maybe you should talk to\nFrank.\n\nOMAR\n(a beat)\nOkay. I don't think this is something I want to do on an overseas phone, but I can go back to Miami and talk to Frank personally.\n\nSOSA\n(without hesitation)\nGood. My chopper can take you to Santa Cruz now. I have a jet there that'll have you in Miami in five hours.\nYou can be back here tomorrow. For lunch.\n\nOmar is taken aback by the speed of the plan.\n\nOMAR\nYeah. I guess so....\n\nTONY\nGreat.\n\nSOSA\n(glancing at Tony, to Omar)\n...leave your friend here. While you're gone maybe he can tell me how to run my business.\n\nOMAR\n(doesn't get it)\nI don't think that...\n\nTONY\n(lighting a cigar)\nHey, it's okay. You tell Frank I'm keeping this guy on ice for him...\n\nSosa laughs. Omar scowls.\n\nCUT TO\n\n95 EXT. SOSA VILLA - DAY 95\n\nThe helicopter blades whirr. The Skull waits inside with the Shadow. They both stare at:\nOmar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.\n\nThe chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the\npolo players exercising in the distance... a woman on a\nhorse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.\n\nSosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.\n\nTONY\nYou know why they say Cubans are all screwed up?\n\nSOSA\nWhy?\n\nTONY\nCause the island's in the Caribbean, the government's in Russia, the Army's in Angola, and the people live in Miami.\n\nSosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past Sosa to an exotic-looking, dark-eyed senorita who gets off her horse, held by a servant, and joins them.\n\nTONY\n(overlapping the joke)\nThey got a beard there that's all. With a cigar and a big mouth.\n\nSOSA\nMaybe he'll move to Miami too...\nGabriella, my rose -- how was the ride?\n\nSosa changes his personality completely with her, dewy-eyed and loving. They peck each other's cheek lightly.\n\nGABRIELLA\n(distracted)\nLovely... but the sheep in the north pasture, they're destroying the grass, it's turning yellow. You must move them darling.\n\nSOSA\nI'll take care of it myself.\n\nGABRIELLA\n(turning to him)\n...and don't forget we have the Rinaldi's at eight.\n\nSOSA\nOf course not. Uh -- an associate of mine. From Miami. Tony Montana...\n(to Tony)\nMy fiance, Gabriella Montini.\n\nTONY\nHello....\nShe nods to him in that somewhat uninterested, rude, upperclass Latin way.\n\nGABRIELLA\nIt's a pleasure.\n\nShe withdraws. Tony watches her go.\n\nTONY\nI gotta hand it to you. You got everything a man could want.\n\nSosa, pleased, reaches for an expensive set of binoculars on the patio table, looks up through them, at the helicopter rising off the lawn.\n\nSOSA\n(focusing the binoculars)\nI like you Tony. There's no lying in you... Unfortunately I don't feel\nthe same way about the rest of your organization.\n\nTony glances up at the chopper, the servant pouring coffee for him.\n\nTONY\nIn-- l -- Whaddaya getting at, Mr. Sosa?\n\nSOSA\nI mean Omar Suarez.\n\nTony, puzzled, glances up at the chopper which now hovers there high above the estate.\n\nSosa passes him the binoculars.\n\nSOSA\nThis garbage was recognized by my associate at lunch.\nFrom several years ago, in New York. He was an informer for the police....\n\nTony, astonished, looks up.\n\n96 THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - OMAR 96\nterrified, being positioned at the door of the chopper by\nthe Shadow and the Skull, his hands tied to his back and a\nlength of thick rope looped around his neck. He is struggling backwards in vain.\n\nSOSA\nHe put Vito Duval and the Ramos Brothers -- Nello and Gino -- away for life. My associate used to work up there.\n\nThrough the binoculars -- they throw Omar out of the\nchopper and he flies downwards and jerks back up as the rope stretches taut, snapping his neck. He hangs there like a broken doll on a string as the chopper moves out of sight.\nA silence.\n\n\n97 TONY 97\nshaken, lowers the binoculars.\nSosa watches him closely for his reaction.\nTony looks back at him, contemplative.\nSosa goes over, pours himself some coffee.\n\nSOSA\nSo how do I know you're not a 'chivato' too Tony?\n\nTONY\n(awry, stalks up to him)\nHey Sosa -- get this straight right now ! I never fucked anybody over in my life didn't have it comin' to him okay! All I got's my two balls-- and my word -- and I don't break 'em. For nobody.\nThat piece of shit up there I never liked, I never trusted..\nFor all I know he's the guy who set me up and got my buddy Angel Fernandez killed.\nBut that's history. I'm here. He's not. You wanna go on with me, say it. You don't, make your move, hodedor!\n\nSOSA\n(moves away)\nI think you speak from the heart Montana, but I say to myself this\nLopez -- your boss -- he has 'chivatos' like that working for him, his judgment stinks. So I think to myself, what other mistakes has this Lopez guy made, how can I trust his organization...hunh? You tell me Tony.\n\nTONY\nHey Frank's smart. Don't blame him for that animal. It's crazy business we're in, it can happen to anybody -- even you y'know. I'll talk to Frank myself. I'll fix this thing up right between you.\n(then)\nYou got my word on that.\n\nSosa approaches Tony, focusing an intense stare on him,\nmakes an elaborate gesture of putting his hands out, Tony\nfollowing the pantomime, puts his out. Sosa now grips them.\n\nSOSA\nYou speak with your eyes muchacho. I think -- you and I -- we can work this thing out, do business a long time together. Just remember -- it's the only thing I ever tell you -- don't fuck me Tony, don't ever try to fuck me.\n\nTheir eyes locked together.\n\nCUT TO\nAERIAL VIEW - MIAMI - TWILIGHT 98\nIn all its Caribbean splendor with the long curving beach\nand rich white buildings, bathed in a lovely violet light.\nMusic theme continuing over.\n\nREVERSE WIPE TO\n\n99 EXT. LOPEZ MOTORS AUTO DEALERSHIP - LITTLE HAVANA - DAY 99\nIn long shot we see an agitated Lopez entering his dealership with his bodyguard. Against a background of used American cars without great distinction, he ad-libs his way through some customers and salesmen, shaking hands and acting like everybody's favorite uncle... 'till we see him approach Tony, who is waiting for him with Manny\noutside his office.\nHe jerks his head. Inside. They go.\n\nCUT TO\n100 INT.

And' you bought that line?\n(pause, eyeing Tony)\nMaybe I made a mistake sending you down there? Maybe you and Sosa know something I don't know?\n\nTONY\nYou saying I'm not being straight with you Frank?\n\nLopez's bodyguard shifts. Manny slips his hand closer to his belt.\n\nLOPEZ\n(carefully)\nLet's just say I want things to stay the way they are. For now. Stall\nyour deal with Sosa.\n\nLong pause. Tony's eyes meeting Lopez's. He gave Sosa his word.\n\nTONY\n(finally)\n...have it your way boss.\n\nHe turns to leave, nods to Manny.\n\nLOPEZ\nMontana... just remember I am the boss.\n\nTONY\nSure you're the boss.\n\nGets to the door, Manny joining him.\n\nLOPEZ\nY'know I told you when you started Tony, the guys who last in this business are guys who fly straight, real low key, real quiet.. -the guys who want it all, the chicks and the champagne and the flash -- they don't last.\n\nTony saying nothing, goes out the door with Manny.\n\n101 EXT.

Cause you don't know what you're missing....\n\nShe leans across the front seat and lightly lays a challenging kiss on his cheek. The ladykiller is rigid in his terror.\n\nShe gets out of the car, crosses in front of his headlights, towards the house, looking at him. He watches.\n\nCUT BACK TO\n113 INT. BABYLON CLUB - LATER THAT NIGHT 113\nThe Owner appears at the mike, the music drifting to Sinatra's \"Strangers In The Night'.\n\nOWNER\nAll right, you coneheads, another exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh?\nNow I want you to check out this next hombre. I found him stoned in the jungle and there's nothing you'll ever see like him. I present with great pride, from Caracas, Venezuela -- 'Octavia' !\n\nLights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as\nsad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-\nlight drawing immediate laughter.\n\nHe is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo\nmask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.\nWith a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established, the music suddenly shifts upbeat to \"Saturday Night Fever\" and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.\n\nTony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.\nMore laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.\nWhen the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome\nface of a young clown in white paint with the large\nblackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing\naudience.\n\nTony is hooked by the image, looks on.\nThe clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and\npulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,\nbouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing, everybody is merry...\n\n...except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the\nsharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to\nits close, a haunting figure of mockery....\n\nTony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time. His\nantennae warn him. Out of the side of his eye, he sees....\n\nThe two hitters moving on him.\nHe sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,\nsmashing the mirrors...\nScreams, crowd diving for cover...\n\nTony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Beretta out of\nhis ankle, firing...\nHits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and ceilings...\n\nTony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing...\nThe second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more\nmirrors, and more screaming.\n\nTony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the\ndoor, his clothes ripped with blood and glass.\n\nThe clown, Octavia, lies dead on the silent dance floor.\n\nCUT TO\n114 EXT. THE BABYLON CLUB - NIGHT 114\nTony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.\n\nExchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking lot, he runs out of ammunition.\nHe jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.\n\nThe second hitter, wounded, running out of the club towards him.\nThe third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.\n\nTony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.\n\nCarhops scattering, the hitters seeking cover.\nHitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head exploding like squashed watermelon.\n\nTony now pops a button. Bulletproof blackout shutters whap\nacross the shattered windows.\nHe guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off\nthe armor plating, whining against the shutters.\n\nTony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the\ngear shift into reverse. In an instant, his warmobile in reverse, accelerates, climbing to top speed...\nAs hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of\nthere, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.\n\nCUT TO\n\n115 INT. SAFEHOUSE - THAT NIGHT 115\nTony, aching from his wound, is attended by a Doctor, who\nreveals to us an ugly wound on his rib cage. Tony looks at\nit, doesn't express a reaction.\n\nDOCTOR\nIt's going to be sore for a few months.\n\nTONY\nSomebody else gonna be a lot sorer...\n(to Chi-Chi)\nFind out where Lopez is....\n\nCUT TO\n116 INT. MIRIAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 116\nMiriam's a tough-looking little chick in panties and a tanktop with \"Cocaine\" written on it.\n\nTONY'S VOICE\nMiriam? Yeah...Tony. Manny there?\n\nMIRIAM\nYeah...

SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT 12:\nTony ignores the doctor taping him, checking his watch.\n\nTONY\n(to Nick)\nNick, when we get there, call Lopez at three exactly.

LOPEZ MOTORS - NIGHT 122\nWaldo remains outside, covering the street as Tony, Manny\nand Chi-chi move gingerly along the darkened showroom...\nLopez's voice on the phone through the half-opened office door.\n\nLOPEZ'S VOICE\n...you're kidding! Three to two?\nSon of a bitch!...\n(cradling the phone)\nGuess what. My softball team, y'know, the Little Lopezers? They won the Division tonight. We're going to Sarasota for the State Championship... Hunh!\n\nMUFFLED VOICE\nCongratulations.

What'd you do -- fix the umpire?\n\nLopez, his nose in a glass of scotch, almost muffs it right\nthere and then, but manages to recover.\n\nLOPEZ\nTony...? Uh, I'll call you back -- yeah.\n\nHangs the phone up and rocks forward at his desk.\nLopez's bodyguard, Ernie, gets the message from Chi-chi\nsliding along the wall next to him, Manny covering the\nother side of the room.\n\nLOPEZ\nTony... what happened to you, hunh?\n\nTONY\nYeah, lookit. They spoiled one of\nmy $800 suits.\n\nLOPEZ\nJesus! Who?\n\nin his ripped suit, shoulder in a sling, face cut, Tony, shifts his eyes with camera slowly onto Mel Bernstein sitting there with a bourbon on the rocks, his two hundred and fifty pounds bulging with irritated surprise.\n\nTONY\nHitters. Somebody musta brought 'em.\nNever seen 'em before...Hiya\nii:;. Is there an answer to this too?\n\nBERNSTEIN\n(uneasy)\nAlways is Montana, always is...\n\nLOPEZ\nJesus, Tony, maybe it was the Diaz Brothers, they got a deep beef going back to the 'Sun Ray' thing.\n\nTONY\nHey, you might be right.\n\nLOPEZ\nAnyway I'm glad you made it Tony, we'll return the favor for you. In spades.\n\nTONY\n(sits at the edge of Lopez's desk)\nNah, I'm gonna take care of this myself.\n\nPause.\n\nLOPEZ\n(awkward)\nWell... What are the guns for Tony?\n\nTONY\n(shrugs)\nWhat for? I'm paranoid I guess.\n\nThe phone rings.\nLopez lets the phone ring.\n\nTONY\nWhy don't you answer it Frank?\n\nLOPEZ\nMust be Elvira. You know women.\nAfter we left that joint she....\n\nThe phone rings again.\n\nTONY\n(reaches for it)\nI'll tell her you're not here.\n\nLOPEZ\n(grabs the phone first)\nWait a minute! I'll talk to her... Hello?...\n(anxious)\nYeah... all right honey, don't worry... I'll be home in an hour.\n\nHe hangs up. Pause.\n\nTONY\nFrank, you're a piece of shit.\n\nLOPEZ\nWhatcha talking 'bout Tony?\n\nTony, angry now, grabs Lopez by the shirt and hauls him\nforward across his desk so his gut lies flat across it.\n\nTONY\nYou know what I'm talking about you fuckin' cockroach!\n\nLOPEZ\nTony, no! Lissen!\n\nTONY\nYou remember what a 'haza' is Frank?\nIt's a pig that don't fly straight. Neither do you, Frank.\n\nLOPEZ\n(nervous)\nWhy would I hurt you, Tony, I brought you in! So we had a few differences, no big deal. I gave you your start Tony, I believed in you !\n\nTONY\nYeah and I stayed loyal to you, Frank. I made what I could on the\nside but I never turned you Frank, never -- but you -- a man ain't got no word, he's a cockroach!\n\nHe squashes an imaginary cockroach right in front of Frank's eyes, then pulls him further across the desk, flailing.\n\nLOPEZ\nMel! Mel! Do something, please!\n\nMel sits there impassively.\n\nMEL\nIt's your tree Frank, you're sitting in it.\n\nLOPEZ\nPlease Tony okay all right! Gimme a second chance! Ten million. I'll\ngive you ten million dollars right now ! I got it in a vault. In Spain. We'll get on a plane. It's yours, all of it... Elvira? You want Elvira? She's yours, okay!

I never hurt nobody!\n\nTONY\nYeah you're right Frank, you always had somebody else do it for you.\n\nHe turns to Manny.\n\nTONY\nManny, you mind shooting this piece of shit for me?\n\nTony steps aside.\n\nLOPEZ\nNo! No! Tony!\n\nManny shoots him with the silencer. Three times.\nLopez crashes backwards, draped over his desk like Marat in\nhis bathtub, amid his patriot flag and his Kennedy photographs.\n\nTONY\n...Every dog has his day.\n\nHe fixes his eyes on Mel Bernstein.\n\nBERNSTEIN\n(remaining calmly in his chair)\nI told him it didn't make sense -- killing you when he coulda had you working for us instead. But he got hot tonight, y'know, about the broad. He fucked up.\n\nTONY\nYeah, so did you, Bernstein.\n\nHis eyes... Bernstein, reading them, gets worried.\n\nBERNSTEIN\nNow wait a minute, Montana, don't go too far.\n\nTONY\nI'm not Mel. You are.\n\nHe produces his Beretta from his sling and holds it in his\nleft hand pointed at the big man.\n\nBERNSTEIN\n(rising from his chair)\nHey, c'mon, what is this?\nYou can't shoot a cop, Tony.\n\nTONY\nWhoever said you were one?\n\nHe fires.\n\nBernstein takes it in the gut, hits the floor, looks up astonished.\n\nBERNSTEIN\nI... lemme go, Tony, I can fix things up...\n\nTONY\nSure you can Chico. Maybe you can handle one of them first-class tickets -- to the Resurrection. So long, Mel, have a good trip.\n\nHe fires several times into him until we can imagine he is\nno longer of the living. Tony turns towards the door.\n\nMANNY\n(indicates bodyguard)\nWhat about him?\n\nTony notices.\nThe bodyguard, Ernie, the middle-aged Cuban, waits stoically.\n\nTONY\nYou want a job Ernie?\n\nERNIE\nSure, Tony.\n\nTONY\nCome see me tomorrow.\n\nERNIE\nThanks, Tony.\n\nTony walks out alone into the darkened showroom, past the\nhulks of the used Cadillacs, as we see the shadows of Manny\nand Chi-Chi moving in a stream of light.\n\nMANNY\n(Offscreen)\nOkay, torch it!\n\nCUT TO\n124 INT.

How's married life? Say hello to the princess for me -- okay. She's beautiful.\nSee you. Take care.\n\nGoing.\n\nTony watches, raging inside.

Why don't you just dig a hole in the garden honey and bury it and forget it.\n\nTONY\nWhat're you talking about, I worked my ass off for all this.\n(indicates the bathroom)\n\nELVIRA\n(starts out)\nIt's too bad.

WAREHOUSE - ALONGSIDE MIAMI FREEWAY - DAY\nTony and Nick The Pig get out of a van, frowning in the\nglary sunlight. From the continual sound of jet aircraft\ntaking off and landing we might sense we're near an airport.\nAs Nick hauls a duffel bag on his back, Tony, carrying a\nsuitcase of his own, reads the sign on top of the warehouse:\n\"CONSOLIDATED CARRIES INC.\n\n160 INT. SEIDELBAUM OFFICE - WAREHOUSE - DAY 160\nThe office is bare and ugly, the furniture naugahyde black.\nThere's noise from an outer office, and people on phones,\nmoving, talking.\nTony and Nick sit on a couch stacking twenty dollar bills\nfrom the duffel bag and suitcase onto a coffee table.\nTwo men in casual sports clothing sit opposite them in\nchairs, one of them -- Seidelbaum -- squaring the bills and\npassing them efficiently through a money-counting machine\nwhich clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene.\nSeidelbaum's a small, fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of\nrings on his fingers and sharp, porky eyes.\n\nThe other guy -- Luis -- a dark Cuban, is long, lean and\nsmooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes. He drinks\ncoffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who\nlook the part.\n\nIt's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties, it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the amounts.\nAt all times all four men, thoroughly aware of the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly although they appear casual and bored. They drink a lot of coffee.\n\nLUIS\n. I . yeah back then I worked in pictures\nI was in that picture down in Columbia.\nBurn, y'ever see it? ...with Marlon Brando.\nWe're good friends. I was his driver...\n\nNICK\n(stacking)\nOh yeah?\n\nLUIS\nYeah, in Caragena, they shot it there... Gillo Pontecorvo, he was the director. Italian guy.\n(pause)\nYeah, I also know Paul Newman.

Say, you know Benny\nAlvarez there?\n\nLUIS\nUh...\n\nSEIDELBAUM\n(interrupting to Tony)\nNow you want a company check here for $283,107.65?\n\nTONY\n(pause, checking his fingers)\nUh... I come up with 284.6\n\nSEIDELBAUM\n(pauses, looks again at his figures)\nNo, that's just not possible. The\nmachine don't make mistakes.\n\nTONY\nWell, we'll count it again.\n\nSIEDELBAUM\nOh Jesus!\n\nTONY\nHey business is business. We're talking $1500.\n\nSEIDELBAUM\n(exasperated)\nOkay, you keep the change okay, I don't give a shit.\n\nTONY\nOkay but I'll go through it again with you.\n\nSeidelbaum ignores it, counting up another stack.\n\nSEIDELBAUM\nOkay...

SEIDELBAUM'S WAREHOUSE OFFICE - DAY\nThey're drinking another round of coffee, exhausted, smoke\nfilling the room. The table now resembles a Mount Everest\nof green and they're still counting. The money, like discarded food, is spread all over the place -- in boxes, brown paper bags, on the couch. They stretch, rub their eyes.\n\nSEIDELBAUM\nWe're up to what?\n\nLUIS\n(consulting his notes)\nSeven checks. A million three hundred twenty-five and six hundred twenty-three ...plus eighteen cents.\n\nTONY\n(grins)\nHey we're almost finished.

HeyI George I go another four hundred grand -- I go 800,000 dollars, okay? With that you can fix the Supreme Court, hunh?\n\nSHEFFIELD\nTony... the law has to prove 'beyond a reasonable doubt.' I'm an expert at raising that doubt but when you got a million three undeclared dollars staring into a videotape camera, honeybaby, it's hard to convince a jury you found it in a taxi cab.\n\nTony paces back and forth like a tiger, corking his fury.\nAbruptly coming to a decision, he whirls and leans across\nSheffield's desk.\n\nTONY\nAll right -- all right.

I think we can solve both our problems.\n\nTony waits.\n\nSOSA\nWe all know you have tax troubles in your country -- and you may have to do a little time. But we have some friends in Washington who tell us these troubles can be taken care of... maybe you'll have to pay a big fine and some back interest, but there's no time....\n\nPause. Tony looks.

SOSA VILLA LIVING ROOM - DAY - VIDEOTAPE - 168\nMATOS STUDY\nA \"Phil Donahue-type\" setting. A segment now in progress\nwith the \"Donahue-type\" interviewing Dr. Orlando Gutierrez.\nGutierrez is a young charismatic man, very well dressed and\npolished in a South American manner who exudes a sense of\nenormous passion.\n\nGUTIERREZ\nMore than 10,000 of our people are being tortured and held without trial. In the past two years, another 6,000 have simply disappeared. And your government -- what does it do? It\nsells my government tanks, planes, guns, but not a word -- not-a whisper-- about human rights!\n\nINTERVIEWER\nI've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez, about the financial support your government receives from the drug industry in Bolivia.\n\nGUTIERREZ\nThe irony, of course, is that this money -- which is in the billions,\nJim - - is coming from your country. You are the major purchaser of our national product -- which of course is cocaine.\n\nINTERVIEWER\nSo what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez is the United States Government is spending millions of dollars to eliminate the flow of drugs into our streets and at the same time is doing business with the very same government that floods those' streets with cocaine... that's a bit like robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?\n\nGUTIERREZ\n(laughs)\nLet me show you some of the other characters in the comedy, Jim... my organization just recently traced a purchase by this man --\n\nGutierrez holds up a photograph -- insert the face on the TV\nscreen, dour, ruthless.\n\nGUTIERREZ\n. . . here he is, the charming face belongs to General Cucombre, the Defense Minister of my country. Two months ago he bought a twelve million dollar villa on-Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.\nNow if he's supposed to be the Bolivian Defense Minister, what's he doing living in Switzerland? Guarding the cash register?\n\nLaughter.\n\n169 TONY 169\nwatching, touching his nose a lot, blowing it, hyped from\nthe coke usage.\n\nSOSA\nA Communist -- financed by Moscow.\n\n170 GUTIERREZ 170\nholds up another photograph -- insert the face on the\nTV screen.\n\nGUTIERREZ\n...this is Alejandro Sosa. Interesting character. A wealthy landowner. Educated in England. Good family. The business brain and drug overlord of an empire stretching across the Andes. Not your ordinary drug dealer....\n\nINTERVIEWER\nWhat are you suggesting we do about this, Doctor?\n\nGUTIERREZ\n(passionate)\nThe United States Government has to stop supporting these fascist gangsters that are running my country, that is what your country has to do. You have to set a strong example by calling for the observation of fundamental human rights.\n\n171 TONY 171\nstaring intently at him, reluctantly impressed.\n\nGUTIERREZ\nYou Americans have no idea how important your country is as a\nsymbol and a bastion of those rights. You have no....\n\nSosa flips off the television. The lights come on. He's alone with Tony.\n\nSOSA\n...he's scheduled next for 60 Minutes. He's going on French, British, Italian, Japanese television. People everywhere are starting to listen to him. He's embarrassing, Tony...\nThat's our problem.\n\nTONY\nYeah.\n\nSosa looks up.\n\nThe Shadow (seen before at the disposal of Omar) comes into\nthe room, thin and quiet, his venomous eyes flicking over\nTony. The Skull leads him in.\n\nSOSA\nYou've met Alberto before?...\n\nTONY\n(remains seated)\nSure. How could I forget?\n\nSOSA\nAlberto, you know Tony Montana -- my partner from Florida.\n\nAlberto nods icily, remains standing adjacent.\n\nSOSA\n(to Tony)\nSo you see Alberto here is going to help fix our problem. Alberto, you know, is an expert in the disposal business -- but he doesn't know his way around the States too well, he doesn't speak English, and he needs a little help...\n(*en)\nIs that a problem, Tony?\n\nTony looks around the faces, then:\n\nTONY\nThat's no problem, Alex....\n\nAlex nods, pleased.\nHold on Tony. He blows his nose again.\n\nCUT TO\n\n175 INT. THE RESTAURANT - MIAMI - NIGHT\nA millionaire's place, like \"The Forge\" on Arthur Godfrey\nRoad. Tony, Elvira, and Manny are shown to their table by the maitre d'. Tony, a little loaded, intersects a group of people at another table and stops, putting his hand on a heavyset man's shoulder.\n\nTONY\nHey, Vic, I watch your show everyday.\n\nVic -- who we saw before editorializing on television.--\ncranes his leonine white head of hair around with a\npatrician annoyance reserved for bores in restaurants.\n\nVIC\nOh, is that so?\n\nTONY\nYeah. Hey, you know that two hundred kilo DEA bust you was congratulating the cops for on the toob the other night?\n\nVIC\nAren't you... Tony Montana?\n\nTONY\n(beaming now, ignoring Manny who comes to retrieve him)\nYeah, that's me.\n\nThe half-dozen rich people in the dinner party are intrigued.\n\nTONY\n(waves to them)\nHi folks, don't get up. Anyway, Vic, check it out. I heard like it was 220 kilos went down. That means twenty is missing, right? Ask your friends, the cops, about that -- and keep up the good work, Vie, but don't believe everything you hear, y'know what I mean? Okay, have a good dinner, nice to meet you people.\n\nWaves farewell to them, pats Vic once more on the shoulder, and leaves them murmuring.\n\nMANNY\n(reproving)\nHey, Tony, that's not cool, he's got a lotta friends in....\n\nTONY\nI don't give a fuck. He's an ass-hole! Never fucking tells the truth on TV! That's the trouble in this country. Nobody fucking tells the truth!\n\nNot caring if he's overheard, Tony seems to be in the grip\nof an anguish he does not understand.\n\nCUT TO\n\n173 TONY\nsits with Manny and Elvira, who is dipping into a vial of coke in the purse in her lap. Another huge meal is being consumed, the best roast beef, bottles of red and white wine, cigars....\n\nMANNY\nSo what's the big mystery, what happened down there with Sosa?\n\nTONY\nLot of bullshit, that's what. Politics.\nThe whole world's turning into politics.\n\nHe pulls out his own vial under the table between eating and drinking.\n\nMANNY\nThe one thing we always stayed out of was politics, Tony.\n\nTONY\nYeah, so what do you think Emilio Rebenga was? Politics or what?\n\nManny remembers.\n\nTONY\nNo free rides in this world, kid.\n\nMANNY\nSo who's this guy you brought back with you, the guy who don't blink?\n\nELVIRA\nWhat guy?\n\nTONY\n(to Manny)\nYou stay out of it. Run things down here. I'll be up in New York next week.\n\nHe takes a hit, unnoticed.\n\nELVIRA\n(unheard)\nWhat guy?\n\nMANNY\n(to Tony)\nI don't like it.\n\nTONY\nYou don't like it! It was you got me into this mess in the first place with that fuckin' Seidelbaum!\n\nWhat's Seidelbaum got to do with this?\nTony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira. He surveys the\ntable with the bored satiety of a Roman Emperor, points to\nElvira's untouched plate.\n\nTONY\nWhy don't you eat your food, what's\nwrong with it?\n\nELVIRA\nI'm not hungry.\n\nShe quickly does one nostril with a quick, practiced move-\nment of her hand.\n\nTONY\nSo what'd you order it for?\n\nELVIRA\nI lost my appetite.\n\nShe does the other nostril. Tony looking at her. One beat.\nTwo beats. He passes a silent burp.\n\nMANNY\n(trying to shift the mood)\nSo what about the trial? I heard Sheffield thinks he can get a new postponement....\n\nTony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues to look at Elvira, then away, encompassing the restaurant.\n\nTONY\n(ignoring the question)\nIs this it? Is that what it's all about, Manny?\nEating, drinking, snorting, fucking? Then what?\nYou're fifty and you got a bag for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and your liver's got spots and you're looking like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?\nIs that what it's all about?\n\nMANNY\nIt's not so bad Tony, could be worse....\n\nTONY\n(doesn't hear)\n. . . is that what I worked 'for? With these hands? Is that what I killed for? For this?\n(turns his gaze stonily on Elvira)\nA junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for a wife? Who never eats nothing, who wakes up with a quaalude, who sleeps all day with black shades on, who won't fuck me cause she's in a coma!\n\nMANNY\n(gently)\nTony, you're drunk.\n\nTONY\n...is this how it ends? And I thought I was a winner? Fuck it\nman, I can't even have a fucking kid with her, her womb's so polluted, I can't even have a fucking little baby!\n\nElvira reacts -- wanting to kill. She gets up and dumps\nher plate filled with food on him. Slop drips all over him.\n\nELVIRA\nYou sonufabitch! You fuck!\n\nThey got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping\naround to clean up the mess. Tony slowly wiping the food\noff himself.\n\nELVIRA\nHow dare you talk to me like that!\nYou call yourself a man! What makes you so much better than me, what do you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?\nOh that's just wonderful Tony -- a real contribution to human history. You want a kid. What kind of father do you think you'd make, Tony? What kind of stories are you going to tell the kid before he goes to sleep at night? You going to drive him to school in the mornings, Tony? You really think you're still going to be alive by the time he goes to school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony, you're dreaming!\n\nThe audience is hushed, involved, the camera moving over\nthe faces of Vie and his rich friends.\n\nTony acidly quiet, looks around at the people, back to her.\n\nTONY\nSit down before I kill you.\n\nELVIRA\n. . . You think of yourself as a husband, too, Tony. But did you ever stay home without having six of your goons\naround all the time? I have Nick the Pig as a friend? What kind of life is that Tony? What kind of life is that?\n(in a softer tone)\nOh Tony don't you see? Don't you see what we've become? We're losers, honey, we're not winners, we're losers...\n\nSilence. Tony's fury has passed. So has Elvira's. There's\nthis awkwardness all of a sudden like two actors who forgot\ntheir lines.\n\nTONY\n(softly)\nGo on, get a cab home, you're stoned.\n(to Manny)\nManny.\n\nELVIRA\nNo, I'm not stoned Tony. You're stoned. You're so stoned you don't\neven know it.\n\nTONY\nAll right I'm stoned.\n\nMANNY\n(rising, trying to put his arm on Elvira)\nCome on, baby.\n\nELVIRA\nNo, no you stay right there Manny, I'm not going home with you... I'm not going home with anybody. I'm going home alone...\n(staring at Tony)\nI'm leaving you. I don't need this shit anymore.\n\nPause. She starts wobbling out.\nPast the silent spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony. Manny rises to follow.\n\nTONY\nLet her go! ...Another Quaalude and she'll love me again.\n\nStumbling once, Elvira disappears out the door.\nTony's eyes follow her. Pause.\n\nThe whole room is watching him sitting there covered with\nfood, the silence cathedral. He stands, wiping at the food\nand throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,\nthen looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.\n\nTONY\nYou're all assholes. You know why?\nCause none of you got the guts to be what you want to be.\n\nHe wobbles against the table. Manny tries to help. Tony\nshakes him loose.\n\nTONY\nYou need people like me so you can point your fingers and say 'hey there's the bad guy!' So what does that make you? Good guys? Don't kid yourselves. You're no better'n me. You just know how to hide -- and how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. I always tell the truth -- even when I lie.\n\nHe starts out, staggers.\n\nTONY\nSo say good night to the bad guy...\nYou're never gonna see a bad guy like me again.\n\nHe walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room\nis empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without\nits star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror\nand delight.\n\nCUT TO\n174 EXT. GUITERREZ' STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT\nA quiet East Eighties street. Two rich-looking male lovers\nstroll past with their dog. A moment of silence. Tony\nmoves into frame.\n\nBehind him, the Shadow (Alberto) moves towards a sedan\nparked along the curb, carrying an airline bag. Be slips\nunder the car.\n\nTony looks:\n\n175 ERNIE\ndown the street at the intersection of the avenue, surveying\ntraffic, signals okay.\n\n176 CHI-CHI\nwaits in Tony's sedan double-parked down the block.\n\nTony, feeling everything's okay, does .a nervous, quick\nsnort, paces next to the vehicle the Shadow disappeared\nunder.\n\nGround level -- the Shadow, using a pen flashlight, removes\nthe bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the\ncamera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,\ntaped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of\nthe Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an\naxle of the car.\n\n177 ERNIE\nsignals.\n\n178 TONY\nsees it.\n\nA cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,\ntowards us.\n\nGround level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.\nTony hurries to the car, bends down.\n\nTONY\n(Spanish)\nPsst!

We're gonna close that\nfucker down.\n\nErnie and Chi-Chi sharing a look.\n\nCHI-CHI\n(eyeing the coke)\nHey Tony, why don't you go easy on that stuff, hunh?\n\nTony looks up at him, focuses. The eyes are uncompromising.\nErnie, a little scared of him now, turns away. Chi-Chi follows.\n\nTony starts on another trek along the coffee table.\n\nCUT TO\n225 EXT. TONY'S MANSION GROUNDS - LATER THAT NIGHT 225\nThe Bengal tiger paces his spot, restless.\nA monsoon-like wind blows through the trees on the estate.\nThe monkeys listen quietly.\nThe flamingoes flutter.\n. . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they go...\n\n. . . and we see Tony, in long shot, throw open the terrace doors and stagger out onto the balcony, overlooking his estate.\n. . . On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the\nbalustrade. He's done so much coke now he's practically\ncatatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.\n\nTONY\n(insensate)\n. . . Jesus fuckin' Christ whatsa matter with me, get a hold of y'self now these cocksuckers gonna run over you, let 'em try, I bury the cocksuckers....\n\nHis point of view -- panning his estate. The dark emptiness echoes back at him. The wind rustling the treetops.\nTony shaking his head at himself, he starts to cry!\n\nTONY\n...Ooooh fuck Manny, how the fuck did I do that? How the fuck! ...oh Manny, Manny ...you were there for me, you were the one, Manny, you understood, always understood...\nWell what the hell happened, hunh?\nWhat the hell happened to us?...\n\nIn far background. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors in his office we see:\n\nThe main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into view, checks the gate, turns. Suddenly two figures spring\nout at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He struggles.\n\nAnother monitor now reveals two more figures moving into\nthe interior of the guard shack. They knife the other Marielito.\n\nA third monitor carries another image of shadows moving\nthrough the trees on the estate.\n\nOn the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost\nincoherent.\n\nTONY\n...I said to you, Manny, I said I never go crazy and you said, I would\nyou sonofabitch and you was right... those were the good days hunh, we was crazy back in those days, we'd do anything, you and me, we was on the way up, nobody nothing coulda stopped us cause we were the best hunh -- the fucking best...\n\nAs Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a hook flying up and catching the balustrade. A shadow starts climbing up as:\n\nTONY\n...we still are Manny, we still are-- see, I'm gonna wipe out all them fuckers out there, I'm gonna run the market, I'm gonna be King Cocaine you hear me, you buy, you buy from me -- Tony Montana. Covers of all the magazines. Fan mail. Television stars, movie stars, shooting stars -- he's a star....\n\n\n226 INT. TONY'S MANSION - OFFICE 226\nAs he crosses into his office, the camera moves to reveal Gina standing there half-dressed in the doorway, her eyes blazing with hatred.\nTony sees her.\nShe steps forward, offering her body almost naked to her\nbrother.\n\nGINA\nIs this what you want Tony?...\n\nTony shocked.\n\nGINA\nYou can't stand another man touching me. So you want me Tony, is that it? Well here I am.\n\nShe fires the Baretta we now see in her hand.\n\nThe bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his catatonia as he goes reeling across the floor behind his desk. She fires again. Again.\n\nGINA\nI'm all yours Tony, I'm all yours now.\n\nBullets ripping into the desk. She advances, offering her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic intervals.\n\nGINA\nCome and get me Tony. Before it's too late.\n\nHe spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put\ndistance between them. She sees him scurrying,. turns, an\nexpression like a demented angel.\n\nGINA\nCome on Tony, fuck me! Fuck me! Fuck me!\n\nAdvancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair\nspilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony\nsquirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling\nover to the terrace windows. Her next shot shatters the window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside onto the terrace behind him:\n\nA young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the\nhitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.\nHe doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.\n\nGina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the\nroom, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.\n\nTony sees it, yells something, in the same instant swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.\nThe punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls him over the balustrade.\n\nThe punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds\nat the base of the balcony.\nTony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and\nempties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the pool below.\n\nErnie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots Tony, yells up ---\n\nERNIE\nGet outta here!\nTony, they're everywhere!\n\nErnie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of silencer bullets.\n\nWe catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,\nmoving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly\nunderneath the balcony on which Tony stands.\n\nTony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back\ninto his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.\nIt takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels, looking questioningly in her face.\n\nTONY\n(gently)\nHey Gina come on, you still angry at me? I didn't mean to kill Manny, I was... I was.\n\nRunning his hands along her face, trying to rouse her, gently lifting her eyelids. Blood's running out of her mouth in rivers.\n\nTONY tx:\nCome on Gina, get off the floor.\nYou're all dirty now, you need a bath...\nMami's gonna be angry baby\n-- ooh is she gonna be mad at me!..\nCome on open your eyes my baby,\nopen your eyes.. -give me a smile.\n\nThere's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over at the monitors.\nOne of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door\npounding it.\n\nCHI-CHI\nBoss ! Hey boss. Open up!\n\nOn the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire\ndown into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade\ngoes off, blows him up against the door.\n\nTONY\nCheeee!\n\nHe now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his\nsideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks up at the monitor.\n\nOn the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the\nfoyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.\nThree of them are already huddled outside the door, around\nthe corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.\n\nTony loading his rocket, intends to beat them to the punch,\ntalking to himself.\n\nTONY\nSo you wanna play hunh, say hello to my little friend here.\n\nKarroooomph!\nThe rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian punks off the landing into the foyer.\nIt sounds like Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing wildly.\n\nTony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex\nof the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.\n\nTONY\nWhores! Cowards! You think you can kill me with lousy bullets hunh?\n\nAnother hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.\n\nTONY\nWho you think I am? I kill all you fuckin' assholes. I take you all to fuckin' hell!\n\nAnother hitter drops, screaming, off the stairs into the pool below.\nA grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing\naway. Laughing like a madman.\n\nTONY\nYou need an army you hear! An army to kill me!\n\nBehind him we see the remainder of the pound of cocaine go\nup in a burst of wind, whipping around the office in auras of white. It is a ghostly effect out of which now appears the face of the Skull moving from the terrace towards Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun.\n\nTONY\nHa ha ha ha ha! You whores, you scum, I piss in your faces!!!! Ha ha ha ha ha!!\n\nThe Skull, now inches from Tony's back, pulls the trigger and blows Tony's spine out his belly.\n\nTony crashes forward over the banister into the interior\nswimming pool below.\n\nHe floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters.\n\nAs the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is\nexpressive salsa with a dash of gaiety.\n\nThe camera moving off Tony to catch the reflection of the lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters. It says:\n\"THE WORLD IS YOURS\"\nAnd so, for the brief moment, it was.\n\nOur camera now distancing itself from the body in the pool,\npanning past the dream villa, past the shambles and the\nwealth, past the hitters pillaging and looting and drawing\nthat obscene word \"Chivato\" in blood on the outside walls,\npast the stacks of cash blowing across the floor like leaves in autumn, with the looters running after it across the busted door with the tropic wind blowing down Coconut\nGrove -- to the Miami skyline across Biscayne Bay\n\nTHE ENDEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 28, "api_path": "/songs/64", "artist_names": "JAY-Z (Ft.

look, I don't need that now\nIt's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do\nAnd the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through\nI get to zoning: me and the chick on the island and

girls\nSweet-toothed, each and every one a little scary\nI said your name, I wore it like a badge of teenage film stars\nHash bars, cherry mash and tinfoil tiaras\nDreaming of Maria Callas, whoever she is\nThis fame thing, I don't get it\nI wrap my hand in plastic to try to look through it\nMaybelline eyes and girl-as-boy moves\nIt can take you far, this star thing, I don't get it\n[Chorus:

thin the blood\nThese corrosives do their magic slowly and sweet\nPhone, eat it, drink, just another chink\nCuts and dents, they catch the light\nAluminum, the weakest link\nI don't wanna disappoint you, I'm not here to anoint you\nI would lick your feet, but is that the sickest move?\nI wear my own crown of sadness and sorrow\nAnd who'd have thought tomorrow would be so strange?\nMy loss, and here we go again\n\n[Chorus: Patti Smith and Michael Stipe]\nI'll take you over, there\nI'll take you over, there\nAluminum, tastes like fear\nAdrenaline, it pulls us near\nI'll take you over,

I got my crew\nDidn't come for no beef cause I don't eat steak\nI got a plate of soul food chicken, rice and gravy\nNot covered in too much\nDrinking a cup of punch, tropical\nEvery last Thursday of the month\n[Verse 2: Big Gipp]\nDaddy put tha hot grits on my chest in tha morning\nWhen I was sick Mary had tha hot soup boiling\nDidn't know why but it felt so good\nLike some waffles in that morning\nHeaded back to tha woods\nNow I'm full as tick\nGot some soul on blast in tha cassette\nFood for my brain\nI haven't stopped learning yet\nHot wings from Mo-Joes\nGot my forehead sweating\nCelery and blue cheese on my menu next\n\n[Verse 3: Khujo]\nSouthern Fry won't allow my body to lie still\nTied face goons surround me like cancer drill\nMe with second-hand obstables\nBut, only to make matters worse\nPlus I'm getting pimped by this temp lady Jackie\nFrom Optima staffing figure laughing\nShut up clown don't talk to me\nLike that looking stupid of course\nLiving day by day and you ain't hard\nTrick hell you say?\nYou might also like[Verse 4: Cee-Lo]\nIt's such a blessing when my eyes\nGet to see the sun rise\nI'm ready to begin\nAnother chance to get further away from where I've been\nBut I'll never forget\nEverythang I went through I appreciate the shit\nBecause If I hada went and took the easy way\nWouldn't be the strong nigga that I am today\nEverythang that I did\nDifferent thangs I was told\nJust ended up being food for my soul\n\n[Hook]\nCome and get yo' soul food, well well\nGood old-fashioned soul food, all right\nEverythang is for free\nAs good as it can be\nCome and get some soul food\n\n[Verse 5: Khujo]\nSunday morning where you reating at?\nI'm on 1365 Wichita Drive\nOle' burd working the stove ride\nChurches dropping chicken in yesterday's grease\nDidn't go together with this quart of Mickey's\nLast night hanging over from a good time\nYeah beef is cheaper but\nIt's pumped with \"red dye\" between two pieces of bread\nShawty look good with dem hairy legs\nWish I could cut her up but, ma stomach come before sex\nA house full of hoes now what's the ingredient\nSpaghetti plus her monthly flow\n[Verse 6: T-Mo]\nThey know they making it hard on the yard\nFuck Chris Darden, fuck Marcia Clark\nTaking us when we're in the spotlight for a joke\nChanging by the day I see it's getting bigga in my square\nLooking at Lenox from the outside\nWith a stare no money to go inside\nTameka and Tiffany outside tripping\nAnd skipping rope to the beats from my jeep\nAs I speak wuz up from the driver seat\n\n[Verse 7: CeeLo Green]\nA heaping helping of fried chicken\nMacaroni and cheese and collard greens\nToo big for my jeans\nSmoke steams from under the lid that's on the pot\nAin't never had a lot, but thankful for\nThe little that I got\nWhy not be?\nFast food got me feeling sick\nThem crackers think they slick\nBy trying to make this bullshit affordable\nI thank the Lord that my voice was recordable\n\n[Verse 8: Big Gipp]\n(Come an get your soul food, well, well)\nHold up C it's what I write\nAnd Miss Lady acting like we in jail\nSays she ain't got no extra hush puppies to sell\nBankhead seafood making me hit that door\nWith a mind full of attitude\nIt was a line at Tha Beautiful\nJJ'S Ribshack was packed too\nLooking to be one of dem days\nWhen Momma ain't cooking\nEverybody's out hunting with tha

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nFour o'clock, I still can't find you\nScared of what our love has come to\nI wait by the phone and I feel so alone\nI cared for you\nI think about the way you treat me\nYou care about your friends before me\nTaken for granted and left empty handed\nI needed you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWish you could see\nHow much I did for you than me\nAnd if I could\nI would turn all the bad to good\n[Chorus]\nGive me, just give me a reason\n(Why should I come back to you?)\nIf you love me, then show me you care\nThen I'll be there\nGive me, just give me a reason\n(Give me a reason)\nIf you love me, then show me you care\n(Show me you care)\nThen I'll be there\n(Boy, why should I come back to you?)\n\n[Verse 2]\nCan't you see how much you hurt me\nTo give away your love so easily?\nI opened my eyes and I saw your lies\nNow you're on your knees\nI think about the way that you treat me\nTo take you back you've got to show me\nSay that you love me\nSo show me you care, then I'll be there\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWish you could see\nHow much I did for you than me\nAnd if I could\nI would turn all the bad to good\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nGive me, just give me a reason\n(Why should I

be there\n(Boy, why should I come back to you?)\n\n[Bridge]\nYou know that I loved you\nBut you treated me so bad\n(You've got to change if you want me back)\nAnd maybe it won't hit you\nUntil you lose the one you had\n\n[Chorus]\nGive me, just give me a reason\n(Why should I come back to you?)\nIf you love me, then show me you care\n(Show me you care)\nThen I'll be there\n(Boy, why should I come back to you?)\nGive me, just give me a reason\n(Give me a reason)\nIf you love me, then show me you care\n(Show me you care)\nThen I'll be there\n(Boy, why should I come back to you?)\n[Outro]\nGive me a reason, give me a reason\n(Why should I come back to you?)\nIf you love me, then show me you care\nThen I'll be there\nGive me a reason, give me a reason\n(Why should I come

Heh, heh\n\n[Verse 1: Kid Frost]\nQ-vo, aqu\u00ed estoy, yeah it's the big boy\nDown with the home girls, down with the homeboys\nKicking back, listening to a Huggy Boy rola\nWaiting for the night to hit so we can find some cholas\nI told you I'll come back in the nine tray\nBumping in my six tray, cruising in the calle\nI gots my parle, \u00f3rale ese\nCause when I do it, I do it all day (All day)\nAnd then I come back again\nWith another stack to spin on all my friends\nAnd now I get my gangster roll on\nBrand new clothes on and so on and so on\nAnd now I need a beat to flow on\n\"Here it

pass any test that many bring\nVatos want to know where I'm from\nI'm from the barrio, East Los Aztl\u00e1n\nAnd ain't no neighborhood can mess with that\nCause it ain't where you're from, it's where you're at\nNow, chavalillos in the park after dark\nAnd the hoodlums run scared when the dogs bark\nSo, get out the neighborhood and don't look back\nBecause I cut no slack when I'm holding a Tec\nAnd it's all about backing up your last name\nWe in the same gang, it's a family thang\n\n[Chorus: Rich Garcia]\nIt's a family affair (Me and la familia)\nIt's a family affair (Always)\nIt's a family affair (Together forever)\nIt's a family affair (Ooo yeah)\n\n[Verse 3: Kid Frost]\nKid Frost back and I'm down\nAnd my familia is anyone whose skin is brown\nRancheros and the trucks saw the grey vans\nTaggers in the alley with a bag full of spray cans\nHere come the jura, got to bail out\nAnd even them coconut cops but they sell out\nThe cholos the cholas who ain't soft\nIt's the mean mafioso, gangster Frost\nComing at ya'll, don't try to slam me\nCause Mexicans always got a big ass family\nThe cuetes, the balas, the Chevy Impalas\nThe gang bang cycles with the media call us\nSo if you're brown you're down, so stay proud\nAnd remember, no busters allowed\nCause the Mexican people is a big ass gang, yeah\nIt's a family thing, huh\n[Chorus: Rich Garcia]\nIt's a family affair (Hey

LyricsFrom an unbiased standpoint, this album is a work of art whether you agree with the lifestyle or not that was led by Raekwon, Ghostface, other clansmen, and rappers now and then. I\u2019m doing this thread in honor of the Purple Tape\u2019s 21st anniversary. Even though you are legal drinking age, you helped popularize Cristal serves as the thesis of the album; that part of the movie where you see the title flash across the screen along with the actors' names\n\n\u201cKnuckleheadz\u201d is where the album kicks into gear and witness U-God drop one of his best verses\n\n\u201cKnowledge God\u201d slows things down a bit with the coldest of that Luca Brasi scene in Godfather I. This is the calm before the storm known as\n\n\u201cCriminology\u201d. This would be the first full gun battle if it were a movie and Ghost drops my favorite verse from him of all time. Next we get into\n\n\u201cIncarcerated Scarfaces\u201d which is one of the few standalone Rae tracks. Those snares cut like a sword. Clean production right here and dope rhymes\n\n\u201cRainy Dayz\u201d is where we find Ghost expressing the lows of the drug game, whereas Rae raps of a better tomorrow and brighter days. Truly a dope track\nThings lighten up a bit on \u201cGuillotine Swordz\u201d, a total bar-fest which Oktoberfest would envy. Deck and GZA drop some of their best lines on this Wu-Classic banger. If it was a movie, this would be a massacre of a scene more bloody than Sonny Corleone\u2019s car\n\n\u201cCan It Be All So Simple (remix)\u201d starts with a knucklehead serving on Ghosts turf and things escalate with gunfire and Ghost is hit. Rapped about in his verse, or a similar incident. This is probably more violent than the original but is a classic remix nonetheless\n\nIn \u201cShark Niggas (Biters),\u201d the two touch on the golden rule of No Biting. Here we learn that not only lines and rhymes can be bitten, but also album covers\n\nSmooth transition to \u201cIce Water\u201d where for many is probably the first time hearing Cappadonna on wax. I really wish I could\u2019ve heard U-God over this beat\n\nNext, we have \u201cGlaciers Of Ice\u201d starting with Ghost talking about this skill of dying Clark Wallabees which we seen in his Ironman cover. The beat eases in and the Chef cooks things up before Ghost and Masta Killa add that flavor and serve the track nice over a beat similar to Guillotine Swordz. Another one of those gun battle scenes I previously mentioned\n\nNext is the rare jewel known as \u201cVerbal Intercourse\u201d which brings Nas fresh off Illmatic acclaim, and is the only non-Wu feature of not only this album but in the Wu\u2019s career so far. A truly great honor, just like the verse Nas drops what many believe to be one of the greatest guest verses of all time. Ghost verse laced with prison-narrative is on par as well\n\nOn \u201cWisdom Body\u201d we have Ghost solo spitting his game to a fine young lady. This track as most likely intended to appeal to the ladies, but still fits on the album. Every made-man needs his lady\n\n\u201cSpot Rushez\u201d we find Rae and Ghost in the beginning feeling like some shit is gonna go down. As we progress through the track with Rae rhyming solo and plotting a heist (well a home invasion but you get the point)casing the place, getting details and finally moving on with the robbery\n\n\u201cIce Cream\u201d is the party before the big showdown and what a party it is. Here we have Meth on the memorable hook and Cappadonna delivering another standout verse along with Rae and Ghost. Definitely a nice track for the summer\n\nAnd finally the epic showdown rises with \u201cWu-Gambinos\u201d. This serves as the epic climax we\u2019ve been waiting for. In the beginning, we hear various clansmen getting prepared and Meth doing a rally call for each. After Meth\u2019s chant, he goes in ripping shit followed by Rae. Afterwards, the man behind the production and sound, RZA drops probably my favorite on the song. With a slick transition comes Masta Killa shooting shit up laying down even more foes before passing the chrome to Ghost so he can sweep the shit clean. This is my favorite song on the album\n\nNext, \u201cHeaven and Hell\u201d which serves as the ending, Rae and Ghost look back on some of the good and bad, and those that were lost throughout the journey. The beat sets the mood well\n\nLast, is \u201cNorth Star (Jewels),\u201d which serves as the credit roll. Here we have Papa Wu dropping jewels and reminiscing on when Rae was growing up. We find Rae rapping alone of an incident of a man killing his homie\u2019s wife and Rae himself seeks revenge while in the middle of a recoding with RZA who disagrees on retaliation but Rae handles his business anyway. After more words from Papa Wu, the album comes to an end. Indeed a cinematic experience in audio form\n\nTL;DR \u2013 The album is a cinematic experience in audio form. The album has a thesis, introduction, body, climax, and ending.
