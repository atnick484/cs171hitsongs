Lyrics[Verse 1]\nDebonair lullabies\nIn melodies revealed\nIn deep despair on lonely nights\nHe knows just how you feel\nThe slyest rhymes, the sharpest suits\nIn miracles made real\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLike a bird in flight on a hot sweet night\nYou know you're right just to hold her tight\nHe soothes it right, makes it out of sight\nAnd everything's good in the world tonight\n[Chorus]\nWhen Smokey sings, I hear violins\nWhen Smokey sings, I forget everything\nAs she's packing her things\nAs she's spreading her wings\nThe front door might slam\nBut the back door it rings\nAnd Smokey sings, he sings\n\n[verse 2]\nElegance in eloquence\nFor sale or rent or hire\nShould I say yes and match his best\nThen I would be a liar\nSymphonies that soothe the rage\nWhen lovers' hearts catch fire\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nLike a bird in flight on a hot sweet night\nYou know you're right just to hold her tight\nHe soothes it right, makes it out of sight\nAnd everything's good in the world tonight\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen Smokey sings, I hear violins\nWhen Smokey sings, I forget everything\nAs she's packing her things\nAs she's spreading her wings\nSmashing the hell\nWith the heaven she brings\nThen Smokey sings, he sings\nYou might also like[Bridge]\n(Would it be true to say)\nLuther croons\nSly's the original originator\nJames screams\nMarvin was the only innovator\nBut nothing can compare\nNothing can compare\nWhen Smokey sings\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen Smokey sings, I hear violins\nWhen Smokey sings, I forget everything\nAs she's packing her things\nAs she's spreading her wings\nShe threw back the ring\nWhen Smokey sings\n\n[Outro]\nSmokey sings\nSmokey singsEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/375331", "artist_names": "Suzanne Vega",

Love Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI've heard talk of blind devotion\nLovers through thick and thin\nLives touched with real emotion\nFaithful 'til the bitter end\nNow I must admit that the story's attractive\nI've lost in far too many affairs\nI've seen all the pain that the morning can bring\nI need to prove to myself\nThis is more than a crush\nCan you convince me\nIt's not just a physical rush\n[Chorus]\nIs this love that I'm feelin'?\nIs this the love that's been keepin' me up all night?\nIs this love that I'm feelin'?\nIs this love?\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo many nights in blind confusion\nI've walked the line of love\nWe reach out in disillusion\nWhen one night isn't nearly enough\nNow I'd like to know that for once in my life\nI'm sure of what tomorrow may bring\nI've heard all your talk\nCan I take it to heart\nNow look me straight in the eye\n'Cause tonight is the night\nWe've got to ask each other\nIf the moment is right\n\n[Chorus]\nIs this love that I'm feelin'?\nIs this the love that's been keepin' me up all night?\nIs this love that I'm feelin'?\nIs this love?\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nI've tread those mean streets\nBlind alleys where the currency of love changes hands\nAll touch, no feeling\nJust another one night stand\nI need to know that there's someone who cares\nCould you be the angel to answer my prayers?\n\n[Chorus]\nIs this love that I'm feelin'?\nIs this the love that's been keepin' me up all night?\nIs this love that I'm feelin'?\nIs this love?\nIs this love that I'm feelin'?\nIs this the love that's been keepin' me up all night?\nIs this love that I'm feelin'?\nIs this love?\nIs this love?Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 7, "api_path": "/songs/96642", "artist_names": "Oran \"Juice\" Jones", "full_title":

"lyrics": "Rumors Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHow do rumors get started?\nThey're started by the jealous people\nAnd they get mad seeing something they had\nAnd somebody else is holding\nThey tell me that temptation is very hard to resist\nBut these wicked women, ooh, they just persist\nMaybe you think it's cute, but girl, I'm not impressed\nI tell you one time only, with my business\nPlease don't mess when you\n[Chorus]\nLook at all these rumors\nThey're surrounding me everyday\nI just need some time, some time to get away from\nFrom all these rumors, I can't take it no more\nMy best friend said there's one out now\nAbout me and the girl next door\n\n[Verse 2]\nDid you hear that one about Tina?\nSome say she's much too loose\nThat came straight from a guy\nWho claims he's tasted her juice\nDid you hear that one about Michael?\nSome say he must be gay\nI tried to argue, but they said if he was straight\nHe wouldn't move that way\nDid you hear that one about Susan?\nSome say she's just a tease\nIn her camisole, she's six feet tall\nShe'll knock you to your knees when you\n\n[Chorus]\nLook at all these rumors\nThey're surrounding me everyday\nI just need some time, some time to get away from\nFrom all these rumors, I can't take it no more\nMy best friend said there's one out now\nAbout me and the girl next door\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nI can't go no place without somebody pointing a finger\nI can't show my face 'cause when it comes to rumors\nI'm a dead ringer, it seems from rumors I just can't get away\nI bet there'll even be rumors floating around on Judgment Day\nI'll think I'll write my congressman and tell him to pass a bill\nFor the next time they catch somebody startin' rumors\nShoot to kill when you\n\n[Chorus]\nLook at all these rumors\nThey're surrounding me everyday\nI just need some time, some time to get away from\nFrom all these rumors, I can't take it no more\nMy best friend said there's one out now\nAbout me and the girl next door\n\n[Bridge]\nWhat's mine is mine\nI ain't got time for rumors in my life\nI'm a man who thinks, not a man who drinks\nSo please let me live my life\nWhat's mine is mine\nI ain't got time for rumors in my life\nI'm a man who thinks, not a man who drinks\nSo please let me live my life (when you)\n[Chorus]\nLook at all these rumors\nThey're surrounding me everyday\nI just need some time, some time to get away from\nFrom all these rumors, I can't take it no more\nMy best friend said there's one out now\nAbout me and the girl next door\n\nLook at all these rumors\nThey're

you the sun\nLook in your eyes one on one\nBut that ain't enough... that ain't enough for you\n\nAnd I could carry the weight of your sad times, dear\nAnd give you the strength to face your fears\nI know I'll never be afraid to say\nI'm here by your side and I'm gonna stay\nI could preach about love that one shouldn't forsake\nWork on my style of give and take\nBut that ain't enough... That ain't enough for you\nSaid ain't enough... it ain't enough for you\n\nAnd I could carry the weight of your sad times, dear\nAnd give you the strength to face your fears\nI know I'll never be afraid to say\nI'm here by your side and I'm gonna stay\nJust a little closer to you, yeah\n\nI could pour you a drink like I pour out my heart\nSmile when I'm sad and act dumb when I'm smart\nBut that ain't enough... that ain't enough for you\nThat ain't enough for youYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/6998158", "artist_names": "Genius", "full_title": "June 2022 Singles Release Calendar by\u00a0Genius", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.999x999x1.png", "id": 6998158, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 8723889, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1663676269, "path": "/Genius-june-2022-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Genius-june-2022-singles-release-calendar-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2022, "month": 6, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "June 2022", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jun. 2022", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.999x999x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 27027}, "title": "June 2022 Singles Release Calendar", "title_with_featured": "June 2022 Singles Release Calendar", "updated_by_human_at": 1663676269, "url": "https://genius.com/Genius-june-2022-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/204611", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/822a5f872a1fcfe377695dc0046c6bc6.900x176x1.jpg", "id": 204611, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0ca83e3130e1303a7f78ba351e3091cd.1000x1000x1.png", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Genius", "slug": "Genius", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Genius", "iq": 77766}, "artist": "Genius", "lyrics": "June 2022 Singles Release Calendar Lyrics6/1\nAmenazzy - \"Hey Chanty\"\nBLK ODYSSY, Benny the Butcher & George Clinton - \"BENNY'S GOT A GUN\"\nCalum Scott - \"Boys in The Street\"\nCXRPSE - \"BOTTOMLESS PIT\"\nDanny Beau - \"MY SUMMER\"\nDenzel Curry & Key Glock - \"Walkin' (Remix)\"\nEli Fross - \"Menace\" ft.

out the rough spots\nIs the hardest part when memories remain\nAnd it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio\n'Cause from the lips of some old singer\nWe can share the troubles we already know\n\n[Chorus]\nTurn 'em on, turn 'em on\nTurn on those sad songs\nWhen all hope is gone (ah...)\nWhy don't you tune in and turn them on?\nThey reach into your room, oh\nJust feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)\nWhen all hope is gone (ooh)\nSad songs say so much\n[Verse 2]\nIf someone else is sufferin' enough, oh, to write it down\nWhen every single word makes sense\nThen it's easier to have those songs around\nThe kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you\nAnd it feels so good to hurt so bad\nAnd suffer just enough to sing the blues\n\n[Chorus]\nSo turn 'em on, turn 'em on\nTurn on those sad songs\nWhen all hope is gone (ah...)\nWhy don't you tune in and turn them on?\nThey reach into your room, oh\nJust feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)\nWhen all hope

heads were turning\nYou and me on the town ooh, we let it all hang out\nThe fire was in us, we were burning\nWe were gonna go all the way\nAnd we never had a doubt\n\n[Chorus]\nWe were running with the night\nPlaying in the shadows\nJust you and I, 'til the morning light\nWe were running, running with the night\n\n[Bridge]\nWe were so in love you and me\nOn the boulevard wild and free\nGiving

call\nHe asked me for my love, and that was all\n\n[Chorus]\nStand back, stand back\nIn the middle of my room, I did not hear from you\nIt's alright, it's alright\nTo be standing in a line (Standing
