I appreciate the opportunity to speak here at the Call to Renewal's Building a Covenant for a New America conference. I've had the opportunity to take a look at your Covenant for a New America. It is filled with outstanding policies and prescriptions for much of what ails this country. So I'd like to congratulate you all on the thoughtful presentations you've given so far about poverty and justice in America, and for putting fire under the feet of the political leadership here in Washington.\n\nBut today I'd like to talk about the connection between religion and politics and perhaps offer some thoughts about how we can sort through some of the often bitter arguments that we've been seeing over the last several years.\n\nI do so because, as you all know, we can affirm the importance of poverty in the Bible; and we can raise up and pass out this Covenant for a New America. We can talk to the press, and we can discuss the religious call to address poverty and environmental stewardship all we want, but it won't have an impact unless we tackle head-on the mutual suspicion that sometimes exists between religious America and secular America.\n\nI want to give you an example that I think illustrates this fact. As some of you know, during the 2004 U.S. Senate General Election I ran against a gentleman named Alan Keyes. Mr. Keyes is well-versed in the Jerry Falwell-Pat Robertson style of rhetoric that often labels progressives as both immoral and godless.\nIndeed, Mr. Keyes announced towards the end of the campaign that, \"Jesus Christ would not vote for Barack Obama. Christ would not vote for Barack Obama because Barack Obama has behaved in a way that it is inconceivable for Christ to have behaved.\"\n\nJesus Christ would not vote for Barack Obama.\n\nNow, I was urged by some of my liberal supporters not to take this statement seriously, to essentially ignore it. To them, Mr. Keyes was an extremist, and his arguments not worth entertaining. And since at the time, I was up 40 points in the polls, it probably wasn't a bad piece of strategic advice.\n\nBut what they didn't understand, however, was that I had to take Mr. Keyes seriously, for he claimed to speak for my religion, and my God. He claimed knowledge of certain truths.\n\nMr. Obama says he's a Christian, he was saying, and yet he supports a lifestyle that the Bible calls an abomination.\n\nMr. Obama says he's a Christian, but supports the destruction of innocent and sacred life.\n\nAnd so what would my supporters have me say? How should I respond? Should I say that a literalist reading of the Bible was folly? Should I say that Mr. Keyes, who is a Roman Catholic, should ignore the teachings of the Pope?\n\nUnwilling to go there, I answered with what has come to be the typically liberal response in such debates - namely, I said that we live in a pluralistic society, that I can't impose my own religious views on another, that I was running to be the U.S. Senator of Illinois and not the Minister of Illinois.\n\nBut Mr. Keyes's implicit accusation that I was not a true Christian nagged at me, and I was also aware that my answer did not adequately address the role my faith has in guiding my own values and my own beliefs.\n\nNow, my dilemma was by no means unique. In a way, it reflected the broader debate we've been having in this country for the last thirty years over the role of religion in politics.\n\nFor some time now, there has been plenty of talk among pundits and pollsters that the political divide in this country has fallen sharply along religious lines. Indeed, the single biggest \"gap\" in party affiliation among white Americans today is not between men and women, or those who reside in so-called Red States and those who reside in Blue, but between those who attend church regularly and those who don't.\n\nConservative leaders have been all too happy to exploit this gap, consistently reminding evangelical Christians that Democrats disrespect their values and dislike their Church, while suggesting to the rest of the country that religious Americans care only about issues like abortion and gay marriage; school prayer and intelligent design.\n\nDemocrats, for the most part, have taken the bait. At best, we may try to avoid the conversation about religious values altogether, fearful of offending anyone and claiming that - regardless of our personal beliefs - constitutional principles tie our hands. At worst, there are some liberals who dismiss religion in the public square as inherently irrational or intolerant, insisting on a caricature of religious Americans that paints them as fanatical, or thinking that the very word \"Christian\" describes one's political opponents, not people of faith.\nNow, such strategies of avoidance may work for progressives when our opponent is Alan Keyes. But over the long haul, I think we make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in people's lives -- in the lives of the American people -- and I think it's time that we join a serious debate about how to reconcile faith with our modern, pluralistic democracy.\n\nAnd if we're going to do that then we first need to understand that Americans are a religious people. 90 percent of us believe in God, 70 percent affiliate themselves with an organized religion, 38 percent call themselves committed Christians, and substantially more people in America believe in angels than they do in evolution.\n\nThis religious tendency is not simply the result of successful marketing by skilled preachers or the draw of popular mega-churches. In fact, it speaks to a hunger that's deeper than that - a hunger that goes beyond any particular issue or cause.\n\nEach day, it seems, thousands of Americans are going about their daily rounds - dropping off the kids at school, driving to the office, flying to a business meeting, shopping at the mall, trying to stay on their diets - and they're coming to the realization that something is missing. They are deciding that their work, their possessions, their diversions, their sheer busyness, is not enough.\n\nThey want a sense of purpose, a narrative arc to their lives. They're looking to relieve a chronic loneliness, a feeling supported by a recent study that shows Americans have fewer close friends and confidants than ever before. And so they need an assurance that somebody out there cares about them, is listening to them - that they are not just destined to travel down that long highway towards nothingness.\n\nAnd I speak with some experience on this matter. I was not raised in a particularly religious household, as undoubtedly many in the audience were. My father, who returned to Kenya when I was just two, was born Muslim but as an adult became an atheist. My mother, whose parents were non-practicing Baptists and Methodists, was probably one of the most spiritual and kindest people I've ever known, but grew up with a healthy skepticism of organized religion herself. As a consequence, so did I.\n\nIt wasn't until after college, when I went to Chicago to work as a community organizer for a group of Christian churches, that I confronted my own spiritual dilemma.\n\nI was working with churches, and the Christians who I worked with recognized themselves in me. They saw that I knew their Book and that I shared their values and sang their songs. But they sensed that a part of me that remained removed, detached, that I was an observer in their midst.\n\nAnd in time, I came to realize that something was missing as well -- that without a vessel for my beliefs, without a commitment to a particular community of faith, at some level I would always remain apart, and alone.\n\nAnd if it weren't for the particular attributes of the historically black church, I may have accepted this fate. But as the months passed in Chicago, I found myself drawn - not just to work with the church, but to be in the church.\n\nFor one thing, I believed and still believe in the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change, a power made real by some of the leaders here today. Because of its past, the black church understands in an intimate way the Biblical call to feed the hungry and cloth the naked and challenge powers and principalities. And in its historical struggles for freedom and the rights of man, I was able to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death, but rather as an active, palpable agent in the world. As a source of hope.\n\nAnd perhaps it was out of this intimate knowledge of hardship -- the grounding of faith in struggle -- that the church offered me a second insight, one that I think is important to emphasize today.\n\nFaith doesn't mean that you don't have doubts.\nYou need to come to church in the first place precisely because you are first of this world, not apart from it. You need to embrace Christ precisely because you have sins to wash away - because you are human and need an ally in this difficult journey.\n\nIt was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ on 95th Street in the Southside of Chicago one day and affirm my Christian faith. It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. I didn't fall out in church. The questions I had didn't magically disappear. But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God's spirit beckoning me. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth.\n\nThat's a path that has been shared by millions upon millions of Americans - evangelicals, Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Muslims alike; some since birth, others at certain turning points in their lives. It is not something they set apart from the rest of their beliefs and values. In fact, it is often what drives their beliefs and their values.\n\nAnd that is why that, if we truly hope to speak to people where they're at - to communicate our hopes and values in a way that's relevant to their own - then as progressives, we cannot abandon the field of religious discourse.\n\nBecause when we ignore the debate about what it means to be a good Christian or Muslim or Jew; when we discuss religion only in the negative sense of where or how it should not be practiced, rather than in the positive sense of what it tells us about our obligations towards one another; when we shy away from religious venues and religious broadcasts because we assume that we will be unwelcome - others will fill the vacuum, those with the most insular views of faith, or those who cynically use religion to justify partisan ends.\n\nIn other words, if we don't reach out to evangelical Christians and other religious Americans and tell them what we stand for, then the Jerry Falwells and Pat Robertsons and Alan Keyeses will continue to hold sway.\n\nMore fundamentally, the discomfort of some progressives with any hint of religion has often prevented us from effectively addressing issues in moral terms. Some of the problem here is rhetorical - if we scrub language of all religious content, we forfeit the imagery and terminology through which millions of Americans understand both their personal morality and social justice. Imagine Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address without reference to \"the judgments of the Lord.\" Or King's I Have a Dream speech without references to \"all of God's children.\" Their summoning of a higher truth helped inspire what had seemed impossible, and move the nation to embrace a common destiny.\n\nOur failure as progressives to tap into the moral underpinnings of the nation is not just rhetorical, though. Our fear of getting \"preachy\" may also lead us to discount the role that values and culture play in some of our most urgent social problems.\n\nAfter all, the problems of poverty and racism, the uninsured and the unemployed, are not simply technical problems in search of the perfect ten point plan. They are rooted in both societal indifference and individual callousness - in the imperfections of man.\n\nSolving these problems will require changes in government policy, but it will also require changes in hearts and a change in minds. I believe in keeping guns out of our inner cities, and that our leaders must say so in the face of the gun manufacturers' lobby - but I also believe that when a gang-banger shoots indiscriminately into a crowd because he feels somebody disrespected him, we've got a moral problem. There's a hole in that young man's heart - a hole that the government alone cannot fix.\n\nI believe in vigorous enforcement of our non-discrimination laws. But I also believe that a transformation of conscience and a genuine commitment to diversity on the part of the nation's CEOs could bring about quicker results than a battalion of lawyers. They have more lawyers than us anyway.\n\nI think that we should put more of our tax dollars into educating poor girls and boys. I think that the work that Marian Wright Edelman has done all her life is absolutely how we should prioritize our resources in the wealthiest nation on earth. I also think that we should give them the information about contraception that can prevent unwanted pregnancies, lower abortion rates, and help assure that that every child is loved and cherished.\n\nBut, you know, my Bible tells me that if we train a child in the way he should go, when he is old he will not turn from it. So I think faith and guidance can help fortify a young woman's sense of self, a young man's sense of responsibility, and a sense of reverence that all young people should have for the act of sexual intimacy.\n\nI am not suggesting that every progressive suddenly latch on to religious terminology - that can be dangerous. Nothing is more transparent than inauthentic expressions of faith. As Jim has mentioned, some politicians come and clap -- off rhythm -- to the choir. We don't need that.\n\nIn fact, because I do not believe that religious people have a monopoly on morality, I would rather have someone who is grounded in morality and ethics, and who is also secular, affirm their morality and ethics and values without pretending that they're something they're not. They don't need to do that. None of us need to do that.\n\nBut what I am suggesting is this - secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square. Frederick Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, Williams Jennings Bryant, Dorothy Day, Martin Luther King - indeed, the majority of great reformers in American history - were not only motivated by faith, but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause. So to say that men and women should not inject their \"personal morality\" into public policy debates is a practical absurdity. Our law is by definition a codification of morality, much of it grounded in the Judeo-Christian tradition.\n\nMoreover, if we progressives shed some of these biases, we might recognize some overlapping values that both religious and secular people share when it comes to the moral and material direction of our country. We might recognize that the call to sacrifice on behalf of the next generation, the need to think in terms of \"thou\" and not just \"I,\" resonates in religious congregations all across the country. And we might realize that we have the ability to reach out to the evangelical community and engage millions of religious Americans in the larger project of American renewal.\n\nSome of this is already beginning to happen. Pastors, friends of mine like Rick Warren and T.D. Jakes are wielding their enormous influences to confront AIDS, Third World debt relief, and the genocide in Darfur. Religious thinkers and activists like our good friend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo are lifting up the Biblical injunction to help the poor as a means of mobilizing Christians against budget cuts to social programs and growing inequality.\n\nAnd by the way, we need Christians on Capitol Hill, Jews on Capitol Hill and Muslims on Capitol Hill talking about the estate tax. When you've got an estate tax debate that proposes a trillion dollars being taken out of social programs to go to a handful of folks who don't need and weren't even asking for it, you know that we need an injection of morality in our political debate.\n\nAcross the country, individual churches like my own and your own are sponsoring day care programs, building senior centers, helping ex-offenders reclaim their lives, and rebuilding our gulf coast in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nSo the question is, how do we build on these still-tentative partnerships between religious and secular people of good will? It's going to take more work, a lot more work than we've done so far. The tensions and the suspicions on each side of the religious divide will have to be squarely addressed. And each side will need to accept some ground rules for collaboration.\n\nWhile I've already laid out some of the work that progressive leaders need to do, I want to talk a little bit about what conservative leaders need to do -- some truths they need to acknowledge.\n\nFor one, they need to understand the critical role that the separation of church and state has played in preserving not only our democracy, but the robustness of our religious practice. Folks tend to forget that during our founding, it wasn't the atheists or the civil libertarians who were the most effective champions of the First Amendment. It was the persecuted minorities, it was Baptists like John Leland who didn't want the established churches to impose their views on folks who were getting happy out in the fields and teaching the scripture to slaves. It was the forbearers of the evangelicals who were the most adamant about not mingling government with religious, because they did not want state-sponsored religion hindering their ability to practice their faith as they understood it.\n\nMoreover, given the increasing diversity of America's population, the dangers of sectarianism have never been greater. Whatever we once were, we are no longer just a Christian nation; we are also a Jewish nation, a Muslim nation, a Buddhist nation, a Hindu nation, and a nation of nonbelievers.\n\nAnd even if we did have only Christians in our midst, if we expelled every non-Christian from the United States of America, whose Christianity would we teach in the schools? Would we go with James Dobson's, or Al Sharpton's? Which passages of Scripture should guide our public policy? Should we go with Leviticus, which suggests slavery is ok and that eating shellfish is abomination? How about Deuteronomy, which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith? Or should we just stick to the Sermon on the Mount - a passage that is so radical that it's doubtful that our own Defense Department would survive its application? So before we get carried away, let's read our bibles. Folks haven't been reading their bibles.\n\nThis brings me to my second point. Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific, values. It requires that their proposals be subject to argument, and amenable to reason. I may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons, but if I seek to pass a law banning the practice, I cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke God's will. I have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith at all.\n\nNow this is going to be difficult for some who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, as many evangelicals do. But in a pluralistic democracy, we have no choice. Politics depends on our ability to persuade each other of common aims based on a common reality. It involves the compromise, the art of what's possible. At some fundamental level, religion does not allow for compromise. It's the art of the impossible. If God has spoken, then followers are expected to live up to God's edicts, regardless of the consequences. To base one's life on such uncompromising commitments may be sublime, but to base our policy making on such commitments would be a dangerous thing. And if you doubt that, let me give you an example.\n\nWe all know the story of Abraham and Isaac. Abraham is ordered by God to offer up his only son, and without argument, he takes Isaac to the mountaintop, binds him to an altar, and raises his knife, prepared to act as God has commanded.\n\nOf course, in the end God sends down an angel to intercede at the very last minute, and Abraham passes God's test of devotion.\n\nBut it's fair to say that if any of us leaving this church saw Abraham on a roof of a building raising his knife, we would, at the very least, call the police and expect the Department of Children and Family Services to take Isaac away from Abraham. We would do so because we do not hear what Abraham hears, do not see what Abraham sees, true as those experiences may be. So the best we can do is act in accordance with those things that we all see, and that we all hear, be it common laws or basic reason.\n\nFinally, any reconciliation between faith and democratic pluralism requires some sense of proportion.\n\nThis goes for both sides.\n\nEven those who claim the Bible's inerrancy make distinctions between Scriptural edicts, sensing that some passages - the Ten Commandments, say, or a belief in Christ's divinity - are central to Christian faith, while others are more culturally specific and may be modified to accommodate modern life.\n\nThe American people intuitively understand this, which is why the majority of Catholics practice birth control and some of those opposed to gay marriage nevertheless are opposed to a Constitutional amendment to ban it. Religious leadership need not accept such wisdom in counseling their flocks, but they should recognize this wisdom in their politics.\n\nBut a sense of proportion should also guide those who police the boundaries between church and state. Not every mention of God in public is a breach to the wall of separation - context matters. It is doubtful that children reciting the Pledge of Allegiance feel oppressed or brainwashed as a consequence of muttering the phrase \"under God.\" I didn't. Having voluntary student prayer groups use school property to meet should not be a threat, any more than its use by the High School Republicans should threaten Democrats. And one can envision certain faith-based programs - targeting ex-offenders or substance abusers - that offer a uniquely powerful way of solving problems.\n\nSo we all have some work to do here. But I am hopeful that we can bridge the gaps that exist and overcome the prejudices each of us bring to this debate. And I have faith that millions of believing Americans want that to happen. No matter how religious they may or may not be, people are tired of seeing faith used as a tool of attack. They don't want faith used to belittle or to divide. They're tired of hearing folks deliver more screed than sermon. Because in the end, that's not how they think about faith in their own lives.\n\nSo let me end with just one other interaction I had during my campaign. A few days after I won the Democratic nomination in my U.S. Senate race, I received an email from a doctor at the University of Chicago Medical School that said the following:\n\n\"Congratulations on your overwhelming and inspiring primary win. I was happy to vote for you, and I will tell you that I am seriously considering voting for you in the general election. I write to express my concerns that may, in the end, prevent me from supporting you.\" The doctor described himself as a Christian who understood his commitments to be \"totalizing.\" His faith led him to a strong opposition to abortion and gay marriage, although he said that his faith also led him to question the idolatry of the free market and quick resort to militarism that seemed to characterize much of the Republican agenda.\n\nBut the reason the doctor was considering not voting for me was not simply my position on abortion. Rather, he had read an entry that my campaign had posted on my Web site, which suggested that I would fight \"right-wing ideologues who want to take away a woman's right to choose.\" The doctor went on to write:\n\n\"I sense that you have a strong sense of justice...and I also sense that you are a fair minded person with a high regard for reason...Whatever your convictions, if you truly believe that those who oppose abortion are all ideologues driven by perverse desires to inflict suffering on women, then you, in my judgment, are not fair-minded....You know that we enter times that are fraught with possibilities for good and for harm, times when we are struggling to make sense of a common polity in the context of plurality, when we are unsure of what grounds we have for making any claims that involve others...I do not ask at this point that you oppose abortion, only that you speak about this issue in fair-minded words.\"\n\nFair-minded words.\n\nSo I looked at my Web site and found the offending words. In fairness to them, my staff had written them using standard Democratic boilerplate language to summarize my pro-choice position during the Democratic primary, at a time when some of my opponents were questioning my commitment to protect Roe v. Wade.\n\nRe-reading the doctor's letter, though, I felt a pang of shame. It is people like him who are looking for a deeper, fuller conversation about religion in this country. They may not change their positions, but they are willing to listen and learn from those who are willing to speak in fair-minded words. Those who know of the central and awesome place that God holds in the lives of so many, and who refuse to treat faith as simply another political issue with which to score points.\n\nSo I wrote back to the doctor, and I thanked him for his advice. The next day, I circulated the email to my staff and changed the language on my website to state in clear but simple terms my pro-choice position. And that night, before I went to bed, I said a prayer of my own - a prayer that I might extend the same presumption of good faith to others that the doctor had extended to me.\n\nAnd that night, before I went to bed I said a prayer of my own. It's a prayer I think I share with a lot of Americans. A hope that we can live with one another in a way that reconciles the beliefs of each with the good of all. It's a prayer worth praying, and a conversation worth having in this country in the months and years to come. Thank you.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/692939", "artist_names": "Ben Jonson", "full_title": "Cynthia\u2019s Revels Act  5.

Scene 3 LyricsENTER HESPERUS, CYNTHIA, ARETE, TIME, PHRONESIS, AND THAUMA.\n\nMUSIC ACCOMPANIED.  HESPERUS SINGS.\n\nQueen and huntress, chaste and fair,\nNow the sun is laid to sleep,\nSeated in thy silver chair,\nState in wonted manner keep:\nHesperus entreats thy light,\nGoddess, excellently bright.\nEarth, let not thy envious shade\nDare itself to interpose;\nCynthia's shining orb was made\nHeav'n to clear, when day did close:\nBless us then with wished sight,\nGoddess excellently bright.\n\nLay thy bow of pearl apart,\nAnd thy crystal shining quiver;\nGive unto the flying hart\nSpace to breathe, how short soever:\nThou, that mak'st a day of night,\nGoddess excellently bright.\n\nCyn.\nWhen hath Diana, like an envious wretch,\nThat glitters only to his soothed self,\nDenying to the world the precious use\nOf hoarded wealth, withheld her friendly aid?\nMonthly we spend our still-repaired shine,\nAnd not forbid our virgin-waxen torch\nTo burn and blaze, while nutriment doth last:\nThat once consumed, out of Jove's treasury\nA new we take, and stick it in our sphere,\nTo give the mutinous kind of wanting men\nTheir look'd-for light.  Yet what is their desert?\nBounty is wrong'd, interpreted as due;\nMortals can challenge not a ray, by right,\nYet do expect the whole of Cynthia's light.\nBut if that deities withdrew their gifts\nFor human follies, what could men deserve\nBut death and darkness?  It behoves the high,\nFor their own sakes, to do things worthily.\nAre.\nMost true, most sacred goddess; for the heavens\nReceive no good of all the good they do:\nNor Jove, nor you, nor other heavenly Powers,\nAre fed with fumes, which do from incense rise,\nOr sacrifices reeking in their gore;\nYet, for the care which you of mortals have,\n(Whose proper good it is that they be so;)\nYou well are pleased with odours redolent:\nBut ignorant is all the race of men,\nWhich still complains, not knowing why, or when.\n\nCyn.\nElse, noble Arete, they would not blame,\nAnd tax, or for unjust, or for as proud,\nThy Cynthia, in the things which are indeed\nThe greatest glories in our starry crown;\nSuch is our chastity, which safely scorns,\nNot love, for who more fervently doth love\nImmortal honour, and divine renown?\nBut giddy Cupid, Venus' frantic son.\nYet, Arete, if by this veiled light\nWe but discover'd (what we not discern)\nAny the least of imputations stand\nReady to sprinkle our unspotted fame\nWith note of lightness, from these revels near:\nNot, for the empire of the universe,\nShould night, or court, this whatsoever shine,\nOr grace of ours, unhappily enjoy.\nPlace and occasion are two privy thieves;\nAnd from poor innocent ladies often steal\nThe best of things, an honourable name;\nTo stay with follies, or where faults may be,\nInfers a crime, although the party free.\nAre.\nHow Cynthianly, that is, how worthily\nAnd like herself, the matchless Cynthia speaks!\nInfinite jealousies, infinite regards,\nDo watch about the true virginity:\nBut Phoebe lives from all, not only fault,\nBut as from thought, so from suspicion free.\nThy presence broad-seals our delights for pure;\nWhat's done in Cynthia's sight, is done secure.\n\nCyn.\nThat then so answer'd, dearest Arete,\nWhat th' argument, or of what sort our sports\nAre like to be this night, I not demand.\nNothing which duty, and desire to please,\nBears written in the forehead, comes amiss.\nBut unto whose invention must we owe\nThe complement of this night's furniture?\n\nAre.\nExcellent goddess, to a man's, whose worth,\nWithout hyperbole, I thus may praise;\nOne at least studious of deserving well,\nAnd, to speak truth, indeed deserving well.\nPotential merit stands for actual,\nWhere only opportunity doth want,\nNot will, nor power; both which in him abound,\nOne whom the Muses and Minerva love;\nFor whom should they, than Crites, more esteem,\nWhom Phoebus, though not Fortune, holdeth dear?\nAnd, which convinceth excellence in him,\nA principal admirer of yourself:\nEven through the ungentle injuries of Fate,\nAnd difficulties, which do virtue choke,\nThus much of him appears.  What other things\nOf farther note do lie unborn in him,\nThem I do leave for cherishment to shew,\nAnd for a goddess graciously to judge.\n\nCyn.\nWe have already judged him, Arete,\nNor are we ignorant how noble minds\nSuffer too much through those indignities\nWhich times and vicious persons cast on them.\nOurself have ever vowed to esteem\nAs virtue for itself, so fortune, base;\nWho's first in worth, the same be first in place.\nNor farther notice, Arete, we crave\nThen thine approval's sovereign warranty:\nLet 't be thy care to make us known to him;\nCynthia shall brighten what the world made dim.\n\n[EXIT ARETE.]\n\nTHE FIRST MASQUE.\n\nENTER CUPID, DISGUISED AS ANTEROS, FOLLOWED BY STORGE, AGLAIA, EUPHANTASTE, AND APHELEIA.\nCup.\nClear pearl of heaven, and, not to be farther ambitious in\ntitles, Cynthia! the fame of this illustrious night, among others,\nhath also drawn these four fair virgins from the palace of their\nqueen Perfection, (a word which makes no sufficient difference\nbetwixt her's and thine,) to visit thy imperial court: for she,\ntheir sovereign, not finding where to dwell among men, before her\nreturn to heaven, advised them wholly to consecrate themselves to\nthy celestial service, as in whose clear spirit (the proper element\nand sphere of virtue) they should behold not her alone, their\never-honoured mistress, but themselves (more truly themselves) to live enthronised.  Herself would have commended them unto thy favour more particularly, but that she knows no commendation is more available with thee, than that of proper virtue.  Nevertheless she willed them to present this crystal mound, a note of monarchy, and symbol of perfection, to thy more worthy deity; which, as here by me they most humbly do, so amongst the rarities thereof, that is the chief, to shew whatsoever the world hath excellent, howsoever remote and various.  But your irradiate judgment will soon discover the secrets of this little crystal world.  Themselves, to appear more plainly, because they know nothing more odious then false pretexts, have chosen to express their several qualities thus in several colours.\n\nThe first, in citron colour, is natural affection, which, given us\nto procure our good, is sometime called Storge; and as every one is\nnearest to himself, so this handmaid of reason, allowable\nSelf-love, as it is without harm, so are none without it: her\nplace in the court of Perfection was to quicken minds in the\npursuit of honour.  Her device is a perpendicular level, upon a\ncube or square; the word, \"se suo modulo\"; alluding to that true\nmeasure of one's self, which as every one ought to make, so is it\nmost conspicuous in thy divine example.\n\nThe second, in green is Aglaia, delectable and pleasant\nconversation, whose property it is to move a kindly delight, and\nsometime not without laughter: her office to entertain assemblies,\nand keep societies together with fair familiarity.  Her device,\nwithin a ring of clouds, a heart with shine about it; the word,\n'curarum nubila pello': an allegory of Cynthia's light, which no\nless clears the sky then her fair mirth the heart.\n\nThe third, in the discoloured mantle spangled all over, is\nEuphantaste, a well-conceited Wittiness, and employed in honouring the court with the riches of her pure invention.  Her device, upon a Petasus, or Mercurial hat, a crescent; The word; \"sic laus ingenii\"; inferring that the praise and glory of wit doth ever\nincrease, as doth thy growing moon.\n\nThe fourth, in white, is Apheleia, a nymph as pure and simple as the soul, or as an abrase table, and is therefore called Simplicity;\nwithout folds, without plaits, without colour, without counterfeit;\nand (to speak plainly) plainness itself.  Her device is no device.\nThe word under her silver shield, \"omnis abest fucus\"; alluding to\nthy spotless self, who art as far from impurity as from mortality.\n\nMyself, celestial goddess, more fit for the court of Cynthia than\nthe arbours of Cytherea, am called Anteros, or Love's enemy; the\nmore welcome therefore to thy court, and the fitter to conduct this\nquaternion, who, as they are thy professed votaries, and for that\ncause adversaries to Love, yet thee, perpetual virgin, they both\nlove, and vow to love eternally.\n\nRE-ENTER ARETE, WITH CRITES.\nCyn.\nNot without wonder, nor without delight\nMine eyes have view'd, in contemplation's depth,\nThis work of wit, divine and excellent:\nWhat shape, what substance, or what unknown power,\nIn virgin's habit, crown'd with laurel leaves,\nAnd olive-branches woven in between,\nOn sea-girt rocks, like to a goddess shines!\nO front!  O face!  O all celestial, sure,\nAnd more than mortal!  Arete, behold\nAnother Cynthia, and another queen,\nWhose glory, like a lasting plenilune,\nSeems ignorant of what it is to wane.\nNor under heaven an object could be found\nMore fit to please.  Let Crites make approach.\nBounty forbids to pall our thanks with stay,\nOr to defer our favour, after view:\nThe time of grace is, when the cause is new.\n\nAre.\nLo, here the man, celestial Delia,\nWho (like a circle bounded in itself)\nContains as much as man in fulness may.\nLo, here the man; who not of usual earth,\nBut of that nobler and more precious mould\nWhich Phoebus' self doth temper, is composed;\nAnd who, though all were wanting to reward,\nYet to himself he would not wanting be:\nThy favours gain is his ambition's most,\nAnd labour's best; who (humble in his height)\nStands fixed silent in thy glorious sight.\n\nCyn.\nWith no less pleasure than we have beheld\nThis precious crystal work of rarest wit,\nOur eye doth read thee, now instiled, our Crites;\nWhom learning, virtue, and our favour last,\nExempteth from the gloomy multitude.\nWith common eye the Supreme should not see:\nHenceforth be ours, the more thyself to be.\n\nCri.\nHeaven's purest light, whose orb may be eclipsed,\nBut not thy praise; divinest Cynthia!\nHow much too narrow for so high a grace,\nThine (save therein) the most unworthy Crites\nDoth find himself! for ever shine thy fame;\nThine honours ever, as thy beauties do.\nIn me they must, my dark world's chiefest lights,\nBy whose propitious beams my powers are raised\nTo hope some part of those most lofty points,\nWhich blessed Arete hath pleased to name,\nAs marks, to which my endeavour's steps should bend:\nMine, as begun at thee, in thee must end.\n\n\nTHE SECOND MASQUE.\n\nENTER MERCURY AS A PAGE, INTRODUCING EUCOSMOS, EUPATHES, EUTOLMOS, AND EUCOLOS.\nMer.\nSister of Phoebus, to whose bright orb we owe, that we not\ncomplain of his absence; these four brethren (for they are\nbrethren, and sons of Eutaxia, a lady known, and highly beloved of\nyour resplendent deity) not able to be absent, when Cynthia held a\nsolemnity, officiously insinuate themselves into thy presence: for,\nas there are four cardinal virtues, upon which the whole frame of\nthe court doth move, so are these the four cardinal properties,\nwithout which the body of compliment moveth not.  With these four\nsilver javelins, (which they bear in their hands) they support in\nprinces' courts the state of the presence, as by office they are\nobliged: which, though here they may seem superfluous, yet, for\nhonour's sake, they thus presume to visit thee, having also been\nemployed in the palace of queen Perfection.  And though to them\nthat would make themselves gracious to a goddess, sacrifices were fitter than presents, or impresses, yet they both hope thy favour,  and (in place of either) use several symbols, containing the\ntitles of thy imperial dignity.\n\nFirst, the hithermost, in the changeable blue and green robe, is\nthe commendably-fashioned gallant Eucosmos; whose courtly habit is the grace of the presence, and delight of the surveying eye; whom ladies understand by the names of Neat and Elegant.  His symbol is, \"divae virgini,\" in which he would express thy deity's\nprincipal glory, which hath ever been virginity.\n\nThe second, in the rich accoutrement, and robe of purple, empaled\nwith gold, is Eupathes; who entertains his mind with an harmless,\nbut not incurious variety; all the objects of his senses are\nsumptuous, himself a gallant, that, without excess, can make use\nof superfluity, go richly in embroideries, jewels, and what not,\nwithout vanity, and fare delicately without gluttony; and\ntherefore (not without cause) is universally thought to be of fine\nhumour.  His symbol is, \"divae optimae\"; an attribute to express\nthy goodness, in which thou so resemblest Jove thy father.\n\nThe third, in the blush-coloured suit, is Eutolmos, as duly\nrespecting others, as never neglecting himself; commonly known by the title of good Audacity; to courts and courtly assemblies a\nguest most acceptable.  His symbol is, \"divae viragini\"; to\nexpress thy hardy courage in chase of savage beasts, which harbour in woods and wildernesses.\n\nThe fourth, in watchet tinsel, is the kind and truly benefique\nEucolos, who imparteth not without respect, but yet without\ndifficulty, and hath the happiness to make every kindness seem\ndouble, by the timely and freely bestowing thereof.  He is the\nchief of them, who by the vulgar are said to be of good nature.\nHis symbol is, \"divae maximae\"; an adjunct to signify thy\ngreatness, which in heaven, earth, and hell, is formidable.\n\nMUSIC.  A DANCE BY THE TWO MASQUES JOINED, DURING WHICH CUPID AND MERCURY RETIRE TO THE SIDE OF THE STAGE.\nCup.\nIs not that Amorphus, the traveller?\n\nMer.\nAs though it were not! do you not see how his legs are in\ntravail with a measure?\n\nCup.\nHedon, thy master is next.\n\nMer.\nWhat, will Cupid turn nomenclator, and cry them?\n\nCup.\nNo, faith, but I have a comedy toward, that would not be lost\nfor a kingdom.\n\nMer.\nIn good time, for Cupid will prove the comedy.\n\nCup.\nMercury, I am studying how to match them.\n\nMer.\nHow to mismatch them were harder.\n\nCup.\nThey are the nymphs must do it; I shall sport myself with\ntheir passions above measure.\n\nMer.\nThose nymphs would be tamed a little indeed, but I fear thou\nhas not arrows for the purpose.\n\nCup.\nO yes, here be of all sorts, flights, rovers, and\nbutt-shafts.  But I can wound with a brandish, and never draw bow\nfor the matter.\n\nMer.\nI cannot but believe it, my invisible archer, and yet\nmethinks you are tedious.\n\nCup.\nIt behoves me to be somewhat circumspect, Mercury; for if\nCynthia hear the twang of my bow, she'll go near to whip me with\nthe string; therefore, to prevent that, I thus discharge a brandish\nupon\u2014it makes no matter which of the couples.  Phantaste and\nAmorphus, at you.  [WAVES HIS ARROW AT THEM.]\n\nMer.\nWill the shaking of a shaft strike them into such a fever of\naffection?\n\nCup.\nAs well as the wink of an eye: but, I pray thee, hinder me\nnot with thy prattle.\n\nMer.\nJove forbid I hinder thee; Marry, all that I fear is\nCynthia's presence, which, with the cold of her chastity, casteth\nsuch an antiperistasis about the place, that no heat of thine will\ntarry with the patient.\n\nCup.\nIt will tarry the rather, for the antiperistasis will keep it\nin.\n\nMer.\nI long to see the experiment.\n\nCup.\nWhy, their marrow boils already, or they are all turn'd\neunuchs.\n\nMer.\nNay, an't be so, I'll give over speaking, and be a spectator\nonly.\n\n[THE FIRST DANCE ENDS.]\n\nAmo.\nCynthia, by my bright soul, is a right exquisite and\nspendidious lady; yet Amorphus, I think, hath seen more fashions, I\nam sure more countries; but whether I have or not, what need we\ngaze on Cynthia, that have ourself to admire?\n\nPha.\nO, excellent Cynthia! yet if Phantaste sat where she does,\nand had such attire on her head, (for attire can do much,) I say\nno more\u2014but goddesses are goddesses, and Phantaste is as she is!\nI would the revels were done once, I might go to my school of glass\nagain, and learn to do myself right after all this ruffling.\n\n[MUSIC; THEY BEGIN THE SECOND DANCE.]\n\nMer.\nHow now Cupid? here's a wonderful change with your brandish!\ndo you not hear how they dote?\n\nCup.\nWhat prodigy is this? no word of love, no mention, no\nmotion!\n\nMer.\nNot a word my little ignis fatue, not a word.\n\nCup.\nAre my darts enchanted? is their vigour gone? is their\nvirtue\u2014\n\nMer.\nWhat!  Cupid turned jealous of himself? ha, ha, ha!\n\nCup.\nLaughs Mercury?\n\nMer.\nIs Cupid angry?\n\nCup.\nHath he not cause, when his purpose is so deluded?\n\nMer.\nA rare comedy, it shall be entitled Cupid's?\n\nCup.\nDo not scorn us Hermes.\n\nMer.\nCholer and Cupid are two fiery things; I scorn them not.\nBut I see that come to pass which I presaged in the beginning.\n\nCup.\nYou cannot tell: perhaps the physic will not work so soon\nupon some as upon others.  It may be the rest are not so resty.\n\nMer.\n\"Ex ungue\"; you know the old adage; as these so are the\nremainder.\n\nCup.\nI'll try: this is the same shaft with which I wounded\nArgurion.\n\n[WAVES HIS ARROW AGAIN.]\n\nMer.\nAy, but let me save you a labour, Cupid: there were certain\nbottles of water fetch'd, and drunk off since that time, by these\ngallants.\n\nCup.\nJove strike me into the earth! the Fountain of Self-love!\n\nMer.\nNay faint not Cupid.\n\nCup.\nI remember'd it not.\n\nMer.\nFaith, it was ominous to take the name of Anteros upon you;\nyou know not what charm or enchantment lies in the word: you saw,\nI durst not venture upon any device in our presentment, but was\ncontent to be no other then a simple page.  Your arrows'\nproperties, (to keep decorum,) Cupid, are suited, it should seem,\nto the nature of him you personate.\n\nCup.\nIndignity not to be borne!\n\nMer.\nNay rather, an attempt to have been forborne.\n\n[THE SECOND DANCE ENDS.]\n\nCup.\nHow might I revenge myself on this insulting Mercury?\nthere's Crites, his minion, he has not tasted of this water?\n[WAVES HIS ARROW AT CRITES.]  It shall be so.  Is Crites\nturn'd dotard on himself too?\n\nMer.\nThat follows not, because the venom of your shafts cannot\npierce him, Cupid.\n\nCup.\nAs though there were one antidote for these, and another\nfor him?\n\nMer.\nAs though there were not; or, as if one effect might not\narise of diverse causes?  What say you to Cynthia, Arete,\nPhronesis, Time, and others there?\n\nCup.\nThey are divine.\n\nMer.\nAnd Crites aspires to be so.\n\n[MUSIC; THEY BEGIN THE THIRD DANCE.]\n\nCup.\nBut that shall not serve him.\n\nMer.\n'Tis like to do it, at this time.  But Cupid is grown too\ncovetous, that will not spare one of a multitude.\n\nCup.\nOne is more than a multitude.\n\nMer.\nArete's favour makes any one shot-proof against thee, Cupid.\nI pray thee, light honey-bee, remember thou art not now in Adonis'\ngarden, but in Cynthia's presence, where thorns lie in garrison\nabout the roses.  Soft, Cynthia speaks.\n\nCyn.\nLadies and gallants of our court, to end,\nAnd give a timely period to our sports,\nLet us conclude them, with declining night;\nOur empire is but of the darker half.\nAnd if you judge it any recompence\nFor your faire pains, t' have earn'd Diana's thanks,\nDiana grants them, and bestows their crown\nTo gratify your acceptable zeal.\nFor you are they, that not, as some have done,\nDo censure us, as too severe and sour,\nBut as, more rightly, gracious to the good;\nAlthough we not deny, unto the proud,\nOr the profane, perhaps indeed austere:\nFor so Actaeon, by presuming far,\nDid, to our grief, incur a fatal doom;\nAnd so, swoln Niobe, comparing more\nThan he presumed, was trophaeed into stone.\nBut are we therefore judged too extreme?\nSeems it no crime to enter sacred bowers,\nAnd hallowed places, with impure aspect,\nMost lewdly to pollute?  Seems it no crime\nTo brave a deity?  Let mortals learn\nTo make religion of offending heaven.\nAnd not at all to censure powers divine.\nTo men this argument should stand for firm,\nA goddess did it, therefore it was good:\nWe are not cruel, nor delight in blood.\u2014\nBut what have serious repetitions\nTo do with revels, and the sports of court?\nWe not intend to sour your late delights\nWith harsh expostulation.  Let it suffice\nThat we take notice, and can take revenge\nOf these calumnious and lewd blasphemies.\nFor we are no less Cynthia than we were,\nNor is our power, but as ourself, the same:\nThough we have now put on no tire of shine,\nBut mortal eyes undazzled may endure.\nYears are beneath the spheres, and time makes weak\nThings under heaven, not powers which govern heaven.\nAnd though ourself be in ourself secure,\nYet let not mortals challenge to themselves\nImmunity from thence.  Lo, this is all:\nHonour hath store of spleen, but wanteth gall.\nOnce more we cast the slumber of our thanks\nOn your ta'en toil, which here let take an end:\nAnd that we not mistake your several worths,\nNor you our favour, from yourselves remove\nWhat makes you not yourselves, those clouds of masque\nParticular pains particular thanks do ask.\n\n[THE DANCERS UNMASK.]\n\nHow! let me view you.  Ha! are we contemn'd?\nIs there so little awe of our disdain,\nThat any (under trust of their disguise)\nShould mix themselves with others of the court,\nAnd, without forehead, boldly press so far,\nAs farther none?  How apt is lenity\nTo be abused! severity to be loath'd!\nAnd yet, how much more doth the seeming face\nOf neighbour virtues, and their borrow'd names,\nAdd of lewd boldness to loose vanities!\nWho would have thought that Philautia durst\nOr have usurped noble Storge's name,\nOr with that theft have ventured on our eyes?\nWho would have thought, that all of them should hope\nSo much of our connivence, as to come\nTo grace themselves with titles not their own?\nInstead of med'cines, have we maladies?\nAnd such imposthumes as Phantaste is\nGrow in our palace?  We must lance these sores,\nOr all will putrify.

thug shit\nI fell in love with crime at a young age, I was into dark shit\nSo much pain, I didn't fear anything\nDestined to be a king, word to everything\nThe infamous little nigga from the Island\nHempstead get dough and get violent\nShout out to Terrace, Park Side\nThe shacks in Martin Luther King Drive\nDusty little hood niggas love my raps\nThey identify with me, they can relate to that\nBig gin gallon, little black strap\nPut you to sleep real quick, little cat nap\nYou wake up in a few months, now how that happen?\nDummy motherfucker got his dome wrapped-ed\n[Verse 2: Blu]\nDamn, it was a wrap with the window cracked\nThe jakes thought it was the crack in the 'Lac, he had the sister crack\nWas on my D and let the sisters pass\nWas on my G, the Capri 83s with the mirror match\nUh, I never bang Crip 'til I hang with Crips\nYou lucky, I ain't had a eight on my hip\nYou seen days when you seen K's, was on gauge\nThinking I ain't seen a gauge, turned the gauge to the ink pen\n88, she sat on the plates\nTold her I was 83, bagged the whole race\nGold chains on my chest, you need a vest just to be the best\nI'm from the West where the realest rest, and the sun sets\nThe sun woke up to the bump with the blunt wet\nThirty minutes after the hour, for the ones fetched\nIt was a Sunday when I did the album\nAnd got my first Jesus piece from my uncle Calvin\nCause I'm a G\n\n[Hook]\nAnd if you wanna see the best of me\nAll you gotta do is test me\nIf I kept bringin' her home, ha\nTell you wanna I'm gonna do, then I'll leave it alone\nOoh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo\nCome on back to me, girl\nYeah, heh, heh, ohh, huh, huh\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Mitchy Slick]\nOnly here by the grace of Jah, jumped out and [?]\nWhere each time bad bitch chase the car\nMandatory too far for a drive-by in the Golden State\nAnd I was clocking away every day like it was just for play\nProduct of the government's foul play, a 80s kid\nAnd it was twice the trip cause back then, it was mainly Crips\nWe're fashionably Su-Woop-in' with a caut-y of conscience\nImpressionably my eyes wide through the nonsense\nSwitch hit no homo, lil nigga wanted nothing more\nThan to come home with a trophy after winning the car show\nNot too many managed to avoid the gathletes\nBut it's no deterring once a young lad turned savage\nHoop dreams turn to coupe dreams, cause on the average\nOnce he 14, he Damu and grabs him a package\n\n[Verse 4: Phil Da Agony]\nHe starts screaming, grab a pitchfork, stab a devil demon\nI seen him, pro-activist promethazine leaning\nDreaming with the sun out, death threats, I pull my gun out\nYour best bet is to run out\nWhat you talkin' 'bout? I air 'em out like tires\nApply pressure with a pair of pliers, sing 'em like Jeremiah\nEsquire swagging in a G-wagon, bragging 'bout\nToe-tagging, blowing fire out a dragon mouth\nDown south or back east, they say out West, you a beast\nCall me in the morning take two of these\nBlue and greens, by any means\nYou a fiend, shoot him up with music like New Orleans\nTalking that patois, Mardi Gras, hardy har\nYou don't go nowhere without your bodyguard, Gang Starr\nParty hard, started off on Crescent Heights boulevard, finished it\nAll my niggas guilty slash innocent\n[Hook]\nAnd if you wanna see the best of me\nAll you gotta do is test me\nIf I kept bringin' her home, ha\nTell you wanna I'm gonna do, then I'll leave it alone\nOoh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo\nCome on back to me, girl\nYeah, heh, heh, ohh, huh, huh1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1473742", "artist_names": "The Olympics (band)", "full_title": "Little Pedro by\u00a0The\u00a0Olympics (band)", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/1b05a3c5e041f2e81513a1524860e7ea.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/1b05a3c5e041f2e81513a1524860e7ea.999x999x1.png", "id": 1473742, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429885560, "path": "/The-olympics-band-little-pedro-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/The-olympics-band-little-pedro-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/1b05a3c5e041f2e81513a1524860e7ea.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/1b05a3c5e041f2e81513a1524860e7ea.999x999x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Little Pedro", "title_with_featured": "Little Pedro", "updated_by_human_at": 1476975569, "url": "https://genius.com/The-olympics-band-little-pedro-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/331164", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/1f9d0d743a83d3f720c78be84798e7b9.1000x1000x1.png", "id": 331164, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/1b05a3c5e041f2e81513a1524860e7ea.999x999x1.png", "index_character": "o", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "The Olympics (band)", "slug": "The-olympics-band", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-olympics-band"}, "artist": "The Olympics (band)", "lyrics": "Little Pedro LyricsLittle Pedro 2:21 Trk 5\nThe Olympics\nEddie Lewis, Charles Fizer\nPoss.

(Script) LyricsTITLE SEQUENCE\nA reel plays with clips from the previous episode.\nCUT TO: VISION RESIDENCE, DAY\nCut to an establishing shot of Wanda and Vision's house. Cut inside, where Wanda paces with Tommy, half of her permed hair tied up in a scrunchie.\n\nWANDA: Please, Tommy, don't you wanna sleep? Mommy wants to sleep... If you go to sleep, I promise, you will be my favorite twin!\n\nVision walks down the stairs, carrying a wailing Billy.\nVISION: Come on now, darling, you know we love them both equally.\n\nWANDA: Don't tell him that! No luck with Billy?\n\nVISION: Tried reading to him, but for some reason, Charles Darwin's \"The Descent of Man\" made him cry even harder.\n\nVision steps towards Wanda.\n\nVISION: Oh. Care to dance, darling?\n\nEach bobbing with a baby, th\u0435y step close togeth\u0435r.\n\nWANDA: It's almost like we're on a date!\n\nVISION: Mm. Keep it down, lads, I was about to get my leg over.\n\nWanda chuckles.\n\nWANDA: Vis?\n\nVISION: Hmm.\n\nWANDA: Would you mind grabbing their binkies?\n\nVISION: Oh, 'course not. Binkies all 'round, I think.\nThey lay Tommy and Billy in their cribs, then Vision heads to the kitchen. Wanda eyes the twins desperately.\n\nWANDA: Now, I know parents aren't supposed to take shortcuts, but I think this situation calls for one, don't you?\n\nBoth twins cry louder.\n\nWANDA: So, go to sleep, my babies!\n\nShe uses her powers on them. It doesn't work.\n\nWANDA: And... go to sleep!\n\nShe tries again. They giggle.\n\nWANDA: Well, I don't think it's very funny! Why won't you do what I want?\n\nVISION: What was that, darling?\n\nVision returns with the binkies on either side of his head.\n\nWANDA: That is not where those go!\n\nWanda pulls them out.\n\nVISION: The noise cancelation is not their primary function?\nWiping off the binkies, she places them in the infants' mouths.\n\nVISION: Ooh!\n\nWANDA: Look, I think it's work--\n\nThe babies spit the binkies out synchronously, one hitting Vision in the chest.\n\nWANDA: Vis?\n\nVISION: Mm.\n\nWANDA: What are we doing wrong?\n\nVISION: Oh, don't worry, dear! We'll figure it out. Perhaps we all need more time to get to know one another.\n\nWANDA: Maybe. Or maybe we just need some help.\n\nThe doorbell rings.\n\nVISION: Oh--!\n\nAgnes walks in.\n\nAGNES: Hiya, kids!\n\nWANDA: Oh, Agnes!\n\nVision covers his face as he switches to human form.\n\nVISION: Agnes! I was just fluffing this pillow! With my... face.\n\nAGNES: Oh, I was just on my way to Jazzercise when I heard your new little bundles of joy were on a sleep strike.\n\nVISION: Oh? Who told you that?\n\nAGNES: Uh, my ears.\n\nAgnes chuckles and Vision hesitantly does so as well.\n\nAGNES: Anyway, Auntie Agnes is here and I've got a couple of tricks up my sleeve.\n\nWANDA: Oh, Agnes, you're a lifesaver!\n\nAGNES: Aw.\n\nVISION: Very well, but- But be careful of their belly buttons, and remember to support their heads, and when was the last time you washed your ha-- Actually, you know what? It would-- Just-- Maybe we better not!\n\nAgnes's smile fades and she shifts her weight uncertainly. The babies' crying settles down.\n\nAGNES: Um...\n\nShe turns to Wanda. The crying has stopped.\n\nAGNES: Uh... Do you want me to take that again?\nWanda looks to Vision, who glances wide-eyed at their neighbor.\n\nWANDA: Uh... I'm sorry?\n\nAGNES: You want me to hold the babies. Should we just take it from the top?\n\nShe picks up her gym bag. Vision chuckles awkwardly.\n\nVISION: What?\n\nWanda chuckles dryly.\n\nWANDA: Oh, don't be silly! Vision, let's... let's let Agnes give it a try.\n\nShe grins through an urging expression. Both Wanda and Agnes laugh and the laugh track joins in. The babies start crying again.\n\nAGNES: Fussy babies, meet buns of steel! We dare you to stay awake!\n\nAgnes and Wanda chuckle.\n\nVISION: Wanda...\n\nWanda and Vision step aside as Agnes rocks the cribs while doing lunges.\n\nVISION: What was that about?\n\nWANDA: What was what?\n\nVISION: \"What was what?\" That, that with Agnes just now.\n\nWANDA: Well, I think she just got confused for a moment. She seems fine now.\n\nVISION: But what she said, the way she looked at you...\n\nWANDA: How did she look at me?\n\nVISION: Well, I didn't... Oh.\n\nAgnes is spritzing a bottle of lavender over the cribs.\n\nAGNES: Lavender! It's supposed to have a calming effect. Ralph sprays it on me every night, but there's no taming this tiger!\n\nVISION: It's so strange...\n\nWANDA: Oh, that's not fair. It's not Agnes's fault that she has an unusually high libido.\n\nVISION: Wanda? Did you really not see what I saw?\n\nA thud from the kitchen draws their attention. They turn to see Agnes handling a glass bottle.\n\nAGNES: Oh, don't mind me! I'm just looking for your dark liquor.\n\nVISION: What?\n\nAGNES: Not for me! For the twins. What kinda babysitter do you think I am?\n\nShe gestures towards the kitchen.\n\nAGNES: I'm just gonna go and check in there!\n\nWANDA: Vision, the boys haven't slept in days. You and I both need a break and Agnes is just being neighborly, that's all!\n\nVision's eyes shift uncertainly.\n\nVISION: Do you hear that?\n\nWANDA: Hear what?\n\nVISION: Absolutely nothing!\n\nWANDA: They finally fell asleep.\n\nThey go to the now-empty cribs.\n\nVISION: They're empty!\n\nWANDA: Then where are the twins?!\n\nBILLY: Mommy?\n\nTOMMY: Daddy?\n\nThey turn to find the twins aged five years old. Agnes sighs fondly.\n\nAGNES: Kids.\n\nShe chuckles.\n\nAGNES: You can't control 'em! No matter how hard you try...\n\nSitting on her counter, Agnes raises her glass, then drinks. Wanda and Vision face their sons.\n\nVISION: Well, hi!\n\nWANDA: Hi!\n\nThe boys rush into their arms.\n\nVISION: How are you doing, baby?\n\nWANDA: Aw...\n\n(Theme Song starts playing)\nCUT TO: S.W.O.R.D. BASE MEDICAL TENT, DAY\nFade in on Monica dressed in hospital attire, laying down on a bed.\n\nHAYWARD (Voice-Over): What's the first thing you do remember?\n\nMONICA (Voice-Over): Pain.\n\nA quick flash shows Monica being pulled into the Hex.\n\nMONICA (Voice-Over): And then...\n\nTwo more flashes showing \"Geraldine\" being thrown out of Westview.\n\nMONICA (Voice-Over): Wanda's voice in my head.\n\nMore flashes of Wanda with menacing whispering in the background.\nA doctor positions an X-Ray machine over Monica's head.\n\nHAYWARD (Voice-Over): Did you try to resist?\n\nMONICA (Voice-Over): There was this feeling keeping me down, this hopeless feeling. Like drowning.\n\nMore flashes, of Monica at the hospital and Maria Rambeau's face.\n\nMONICA (Voice-Over): It was grief.\n\nFlashes show Wanda's anguished face, accompanied by her screaming. Back to the present.\n\nDOCTOR: You can sit up now.\n\nMONICA: Great.\n\nMonica sits up.\n\nMONICA: So, am I cleared?\n\nDOCTOR: Once I get a look at these.\n\nMONICA: Where's my uniform?\n\nDOCTOR: In analysis.\n\nWoo and Darcy enter the medical tent.\n\nJIMMY: Mighty glad to have you back, Captain. How you feeling?\n\nMONICA: Like myself.\n\nJIMMY: Well, thank heavens for that.\n\nMONICA: Uh, what's the latest?\n\nDarcy clears her throat and hands Monica a pair of folded clothes.\n\nDARCY: Uh, there's a briefing in ten. Pants are encouraged.\n\nMONICA: Thank you.\n\nShe accepts the clothes.\n\nJIMMY: This is Doctor Darcy Lewis, she's the one who discovered the broadcast.\n\nDARCY: Monica, I know. Um... Big fan.\n\nThe doctor walks over, holding the results.\n\nDOCTOR: We're gonna need to take these again. There's something wrong with the machine.\n\nThe picture shows white, with a faint outline of a shoulder peering through.\n\nDARCY: Those are blank.\n\nDOCTOR: Like I said.\n\nDARCY: Well, what about her labs?\n\nDOCTOR: I need another blood draw.\n\nMonica chuckles mirthlessly.\n\nMONICA: No, no, no. We're done here.\n\nMonica gets up and walks off to change.\n\nJIMMY: She does that. See you at the briefing!\n\nMonica pulls a curtain behind her.\nCUT TO: INT, S.W.O.R.D. TENT , DAY\n\nHAYWARD: Morning. We are now assessing a more clear picture of this crisis. And thanks to Captain Rambeau, we now have first-person intel from inside the Westview Anomaly. Our initial theory had Wanda Maximoff as one of many victims, we now know she is the principal victimizer. Jimmy.\n\nJIMMY: Quick history on our subject.\n\nFootage starts playing on a holographic table in the center of the room.\n\nJIMMY: Born in Sokovia in 1989 to Irina and Oleg Maximoff, both killed in an air raid when Maximoff and her twin brother, Pietro, were ten.\n\nIt switches to the protest in \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\".\n\nHAYWARD: The twins were subsequently radicalized, volunteering at HYDRA.\n\nJIMMY: That's an oversimplification of events, but, yes.\n\nHayward looks miffed.\n\nAfter unspecified experimentation with the Mind Stone, Maximoff gained telekinetic and telepathic abilities.\n\nHAYWARD: Back up, Jimmy. Does Maximoff have an alias?\n\nJIMMY: No, sir.\n\nHAYWARD: No funny nickname?\n\nJIMMY: Not a one.\n\nHAYWARD: And earliest tracking had her using her powers against the Avengers. Is that correct?\n\nJIMMY: Right before she earned their trust and became one herself.\n\nFootage switches to the aftermath of \"Captain America: Civil War\".\n\nHAYWARD: Lagos and Germany. We all know how that turned out. Thanks, Jimmy.\n\nWith a resigned look, Woo steps aside.\n\nHAYWARD: Now that we have the lay of the land, let's talk about strategy. It is the policy...\n\nJIMMY: I try not to speak ill of people...\n\nDARCY: Then allow me. Hayward's a di--\n\nHAYWARD: ...terrorists.\n\nMONICA: Wanda's not a terrorist.\n\nHe pulls out a folder and flips through the papers in it.\n\nHAYWARD: By your own account, you described the experience of being under her mind control as \"excruciating, terrifying, a violation.\"\n\nA few screens show Monica as Geraldine with Wanda in her house.\n\n\"GERALDINE\": Wanda, what's up? And now that I've gone all corporate...\n\nMONICA: My point is, I don't believe she has a political agenda or any inclination toward destruction.\n\nHAYWARD: Monica, she blasted you halfway across New Jersey.\n\nMONICA: And I survived because she chose to protect me.\n\nHAYWARD: She's holding thousands of people hostage.\n\nMONICA: And it could've been thousands more if she hadn't put up her own quarantine. Listen, I- I don't believe this is a premeditated act of aggression.\n\nHAYWARD: You don't? Bring up the visual.\n\nFour surveillance feeds appear on the table screen.\n\nHAYWARD: This morning, I received authorization to share this highly sensitive material from S.W.O.R.D. headquarters. Until very recently, it was the top-secret location of the Vision's corpse.\n\nThe feed shows Wanda storming into S.W.O.R.D. headquarters. She shatters a glass window overlooking a lab, then two of the feeds go offline. Landing in the lab, she advances on scientists surrounding Vision's corpse.\n\nMONICA: When was this?\n\nHAYWARD: Nine days ago. Maximoff stormed our facility, stole the Vision's body, and resurrected him.\n\nJIMMY: But that's in direct violation of Section 36 B of the Sokovia Accords.\n\nHAYWARD: And the Vision's own living will.\n\nJIMMY: He didn't want to be anybody's weapon.\n\nHAYWARD: Maximoff, in her grief, disregarded his wishes. All right, that's it for now. Let's work the problem, people. Dismissed.\n\nEveryone except Woo, Monica, and Darcy disperses.\n\nJIMMY: But how did she even do it? Bring him back without the Mind Stone?\n\nDARCY: Who knows? But she has the world's only vibranium synthezoid playing, Father-Knows-Best in suburbia. What happens when he learns the truth?\n\nThe trio stares at a vintage TV paused on a portrait of the family. It zooms in, taking us to...\nCUT TO: VISION RESIDENCE KITCHEN, DAY\nTommy and Billy stand at the sink, overflowing with bubbles.\n\nBILLY: I don't think he likes the water.\n\nTOMMY: But we have to get him clean so Mommy will let us keep him.\n\nWANDA: Tommy, Billy!\n\nTOMMY: Oh, no! Mommy's coming!\n\nWanda walks into the kitchen\n\nWANDA: You know, I don't miss the crying, but jeez Lousie, did you have to learn to walk? You two never stay put.\n\nThe twins stand, blocking her view of the sink.\n\nWANDA: Unless you're innocently forming a human wall in front of the kitchen sink.\n\nThere is a sneeze...\n\nWANDA: Bless you.\n\nBILLY AND TOMMY: Thank you.\n\n...followed by a soft bark.\n\nWANDA: Now tell me which one of you just barked? Scoot.\n\nThe twins move aside, revealing a small dog, which wags its tail in the kitchen sink.\n\nWANDA: Oh, boy. Waiter, what's this canine doing in my kitchen sink?\n\nTOMMY: The doggy paddle?\n\nBILLY: Can we keep him, Mommy?\n\nWANDA: Well, I'm sure his owners miss him very much. Come on.\n\nThe dog crawls out of the sink and Wanda dries it off.\n\nWANDA: Huh. There really is no collar.\n\nTOMMY: Can we keep him?\n\nBILLY: He was outside. Crying, alone.\n\nWANDA: Now, boys, taking care of a living thing is a big responsibility. Dogs need food, exercise, training, belly rubs, and cuddles, and kisses between his little ears...!\n\nVision walks into the kitchen\n\nVISION: Morning, wife! Morning, boys! Good morning, unfamiliar wet animal. Who's this?\n\nWANDA: We're not quite sure, actually.\n\nWanda sets the dog down.\n\nWANDA: Why so formal, honey?\n\nVISION: Oh, it's just a precaution, really, I had a hunch someone might pop over.\n\nThe back door opens, revealing Agnes with a dog house in hand.\n\nAGNES: Hi, kiddos!\n\nVISION: With exactly the item we require.\n\nAGNES: My kitchen window told me someone got a new pooch!\n\nShe sets it down on the table. The dog barks and sniffs around an outlet.\n\nAGNES: Did you name him yet?\n\nBILLY: How about Sniffy?\n\nAGNES: Oh!\n\nAgnes chuckles. The outlet sparks and the dog whimpers, running away.\n\nAGNES: How about Sparky?\n\nWANDA: Well, should we make it official?\n\nWanda conjures a dog collar.\n\nVISION: Wanda.\n\nWANDA: Hm?\n\nVISION: Agnes was right there!\n\nWANDA: Well, she didn't notice. She didn't even notice when the boys went from babies to five-year-olds.\n\nVISION: That's not what we agreed upon! You made no effort to conceal your abilities.\n\nWANDA: Well, I'm tired of hiding, Vis. And maybe you don't have to either.\n\nVISION: Wanda, we are usually so much of the same mind. But right now...\n\nHe eyes her with growing concern.\n\nVISION: What aren't you telling me?\n\nBILLY: So, is Sparky our dog, Daddy?\n\nVISION: What?\n\nWanda glances at her husband.\n\nWANDA: Boys, your father and I don't think you're ready to properly care for an animal until you're at least...\n\nShe turns back to Vision, who fake coughs.\n\nVISION: Ten. Ten.\n\nWANDA: Ten years old.\n\nThe twins share a mischievous look.\n\nVISION: Wait, now, hang on there a minute...\n\nWANDA (overlapping): Wait, no, no, no.\n\nThe boys age up to ten-year-olds.\n\nVISION: ...you young whippersnappers!\n\nWANDA: No, no, no!\n\nAGNES: Let's just hope this dog stays the same size. Woof, woof!\n\nCUT TO: S.W.O.R.D. BASE EXTERIOR, DAY\nWoo walks briskly across the base, carrying three to-go cups of coffee.\nCUT TO: S.W.O.R.D. COMMAND TENT INT., DAY\nMonica stands by a whiteboard covered in diagrams and equations.\n\nMONICA: Okay. Okay, okay, I've got it. What I need is a ten thousand pound fallout shelter comprised of lead for photons, cadmium for neutrons, tantalum for seismic blasts, on wheels.\n\nDarcy listens politely.\n\nMONICA: And then, I would be able to safely re-enter Westview. Right?\n\nDARCY: Yes. Theoretically.\n\nMONICA: I can work with theoretically.\n\nWoo walks in, handing the cups to Monica and Darcy.\n\nJIMMY: What'd I miss?\n\nDARCY: The twins aged up to ten.\n\nJIMMY: Holy Christmas! At this rate, they'll be empty nesters by dinner time.\n\nMONICA: I know an aerospace engineer who'd be up for this challenge.\n\nMonica picks up her phone.\n\nDARCY: But I can't guarantee the Hex won't just mind-wipe you as you go in.\n\nMONICA: Wait. What's the Hex?\n\nDARCY: Oh, um, it's what I'm calling the anomaly because of its hexagonal shape. It's starting to catch on.\n\nMonica looks at Woo, who shakes his head subtly.\n\nDARCY: You really wanna go back in there? After everything she's put you through?\n\nMONICA: Yeah. Yes, I do.\n\nWoo walks up to the screen, pointing at the twins.\n\nJIMMY: Have we identified these minors yet? Or the newborns?\n\nMONICA: Oh, Wanda's twins are hers. Everything might look fake in the TV, but everything in there is real.\n\nJIMMY: But, Wanda manipulates people's perceptions, makes them hallucinate.\n\nDARCY: Yeah, that's her whole bag. If all the sets and props and wardrobe were solid matter, that would mean she's wielding an insane amount of power.\n\nJIMMY: Far exceeding anything she's displayed in the past.\n\nMONICA: Uh, she could've taken out Thanos on her own if he hadn't initiated a blitz. I mean, nobody else came close.\n\nJIMMY: Well, I'd argue that Captain Marvel came close.\n\nMonica hardens.\n\nDARCY: Her powers came from an Infinity Stone, too, right?\n\nMONICA: We are not talking about her, we are talking about Wanda.\n\nShe takes down a photo of the helicopter.\n\nMONICA: Darcy? What was that you were saying about, uh, props and sets and...\n\nDARCY: Wardrobe?\n\nAs Monica looks down at the photo, a smile brightens her face.\n\nMONICA: Where's the lab?\n\nCUT TO: S.W.O.R.D. COMMAND LAB, DAY\nMonica strides purposefully down a hallway between tents. In the lab, she makes a beeline for her 1970s outfit from the show, clipped against a standing panel.\n\nJIMMY: What are we looking for?\n\nMONICA: That.\n\nShe pulls it off the panel and takes it over to a computer.\n\nDARCY: Oh, man. Are we being mind-controlled to see that right now?\n\nJIMMY: Jeepers Creepers.\n\nThe computer finishes analyzing the pants.\n\nMONICA: Oh, no, they're real, alright. Mind if I borrow this?\n\nShe takes Jimmy's gun.\n\nJIMMY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa--!\n\nShe fires at the pants. Darcy lets out a surprised exclamation.\n\nDARCY: Whoa!\n\nStepping forwards cautiously, Woo bends down and picks up one of the spent bullets. He straightens with a furrowed brow.\n\nJIMMY: You had a bulletproof vest on when you went inside, didn't you?\n\nMONICA: Those pants are eighty-seven percent Kevlar. It's not an illusion, Wanda is rewriting reality!\n\nDARCY: Permanently?\n\nMONICA: I-I-If she can change things as they go into the Hex...\n\nDARCY: Ah, you called it the Hex!\n\nMonica gives Darcy a small smile.\n\nMONICA: What happens if we send something in that requires no change?\n\nHer colleagues glance off thoughtfully.\nCUT TO: INT. COMPUTATIONAL SERVICES INC., DAY\nCut to an establishing shot of Vision\u2019s workplace, now updated with a retro font. Inside, Vision finishes plugging in a computer as Norm works on one at his own desk.\n\nNORM: So, you're telling me this is a typewriter, a Rolodex, and a calendar all in one? What else can it do, find me a wife?\n\nVISION: Eventually, yes.\n\nNORM: It's a hell of a thing, watching you work these computers, Vision. It's like you speak their language!\n\nVision stands and walks over to Norm's desk.\n\nVISION: What do you think, Norm? Shall we surf the internet?\n\nNORM: Cowabunga, dude!\n\nNorm vacates his seat for Vision, who taps the keyboard. A list of zeroes and ones appear, followed by a screen indicating a waiting e-mail message.\n\nNORM: Oh, hey, look! We got an electronic mail already!\n\nHe begins searching through one of the cabinets at his desk.\n\nVISION: It's called an e-mail, Norm. What are you looking for?\n\nNORM: Letter opener.\n\nVISION: Ah, we don't need that! We're already cutting-edge.\n\nVision opens the message.\n\nNORM: S.W.O.R.D. Top Secret Communique. Authenticate.\n\nEveryone in the office reads aloud in unison.\n\nOFFICE ENSEMBLE: Doctor Darcy Lewis' findings regarding Maximoff anomaly. High levels of radiation present at perimeter, Effect on Westview residents unknown. Please advise.\n\nThey break off into laughter. Vision wears a disturbed expression.\n\nNORM: Well, come on, pal, what are we gonna write back? You're the office funny guy!\n\nVision touches the computer, which shuts off.\n\nNORM: It's a joke? Can't you tell? None of it is real!\n\nVision touches Norm's temples, light glowing at the contact points. Norm's expression shifts to fear.\n\nNORM: Please. Please help me. What day is it? How long has it been? Where's my phone?! I have to call my sister.\n\nHe rifles through the desk again.\n\nVISION: Norm...\n\nNORM: She's taking care of our dad, he's sick. Where's my phone?!\n\nVISION: Calm yourself, Norm, I can't understand what you're trying to tell me.\n\nNorm grabs onto Vision's shirt, desperate.\n\nNORM: You have to stop her!\n\nVISION: Stop who?\n\nNORM: She's in my head. None of it is my own. It hurts. It hurts so much! Just make her stop... Just make her stop--!\n\nVision touches Norm's temples again and he smiles.\n\nNORM: Now, tell me this; if I sent an e-mail, where would I put the stamp?\n\nVision turns away with a look of dread.\n\nNORM: Technology. Huh...\n\nCUT TO: VISION RESIDENCE, DAY\nCut to an establishing shot of Wanda and Vision's house. Cut inside, where Billy holds a treat in front of Sparky.\n\nBILLY: Sit, Sparky, sit!\n\nHe does.\n\nBILLY: Good dog! Speak!\n\nSparky barks\n\nBILLY: Nice, Sparky! Now spin!\n\nThe dog obeys.\n\nBILLY: Good boy!\n\nWANDA: Oh, bravo, Billy! You weren't so bad, either, Sparky!\n\nTOMMY: That was radical! Where's dad? We gotta go show dad!\n\nTommy runs off the couch.\n\nWANDA: Oh, he's... He's at work!\n\nThe boys turn to her confusedly.\n\nTOMMY: Huh?\n\nBILLY: It's Saturday.\n\nWANDA: No, it's not, it's Monday.\n\nTOMMY: This morning was Saturday.\n\nWANDA: There was an emergency at the office and your father had to go in. End of story.\n\nBilly and Tommy share a look.\n\nWANDA: Look, he just... he needed a distraction.\n\nTOMMY: From what?\n\nBILLY: From us?\n\nWANDA: No! No way, no!\n\nWanda walks up and steps behind them, leading them to the couch.\n\nWANDA: Sometimes, your dad and I aren't on the same page, but that's just temporary. Like the two of you, you might fight over toys...\n\nShe gestures to Tommy.\n\nWANDA: But he's always going to be your brother.\n\nShe gestures to Billy.\n\nWANDA: And he's always going to be yours. Because family is forever.\n\nTOMMY: Do you have a brother, Mom?\n\nWanda stills.\n\nWANDA: I do. Yeah, he's far away from here. And that makes me sad sometimes.\n\nSparky jumps off the couch and runs to the front door, growling.\n\nBILLY: Hey, Sparky, what's up, boy?\n\nHis growling intensifies.\n\nBILLY: Something's scaring him!\n\nA worried look crosses Wanda's face as we hear the sounds of a drone outside the house.\n\nWANDA: Stay here.\n\nThe boys watch as their mom opens the door and Sparky runs out.\n\nBILLY: Sparky!\n\nTommy and Billy run out after Wanda.\nCUT TO: S.W.O.R.D. BASE COMMAND TENT, NIGHT\nWords flash across a staticky drone signal flying over Westview -- \"Weak Signal\". At the base, Monica controls it with a joystick.\n\nHAYWARD: I know this is tech from the '80s, but can we sharpen the visuals?\n\nMONICA: Working on it.\n\nShe flies the drone to Wanda's and Vision's house.\n\nMONICA: Maximoff located.\n\nHAYWARD: Well done.\n\nJIMMY: We can't see the drone on the broadcast. Wanda's framing it out of the shot.\n\nDARCY: Just like all the jump cuts. Wanda decides what makes it onto her show and what doesn't.\n\nHAYWARD: And here we go. You're up.\n\nMonica speaks into her headset.\n\nMONICA: Wanda, this is Captain Monica Rambeau. Can you hear me?\n\nFrom her front walk, Wanda glares up at the drone.\n\nMONICA: I just wanna talk. That's it.\n\nHer eyes glow red.\n\nHAYWARD: No joy.\n\nMonica groans. Hayward signals over to Agent Monti, who nods over to another agent.\n\nMONICA: Wait, my controls aren't working. Reconnect patch.\n\nHAYWARD: Disregard. Take the shot.\n\nMONICA: What? No, the drone isn't armed.\n\nHAYWARD: Take the shot.\n\nThe sound of a firing missile is heard. The drone view flickers and goes dark. Monica rips off her headset and turns to face Hayward.\n\nMONICA: What did you do?!\n\nAn alarm sounds off and the base lights flicker red.\n\nAGENT: There's a breach, sir!\n\nHayward and the other agents rush off. Monica glances worriedly out the window. Darcy and Woo walk away from her workstation. Grabbing her coat, Monica joins everyone in going outside.\n\nSeveral vehicles drive onto the grass, just inside the perimeter of floodlights and several soldiers pour out, aiming their laser-sighted weapons at the energy field.\n\nWoo and Darcy stand back as Hayward and Monica stand before the soldiers with weapons. The energy field flickers briefly, revealing a silhouetted figure.\n\nLines resembling static flicker along the barrier, then a pulse of red emanates outward as Wanda emerges from the barrier in modern clothing, dragging a missile behind her. The projectile glows red and sparks as Wanda approaches the joint task force.\n\nWANDA: Is this yours?\n\nWith one hand, she flings it at Hayward's feet, where it continues sparking. The armed soldiers keep their laser sights on her.\n\nHAYWARD: The missile was just a precaution. You can hardly blame us, Wanda.\n\nWANDA: Oh, I think I can. This will be your only warning. Stay out of my home. You don't bother me, I won't bother you.\n\nHAYWARD: I wish it could be that simple. You've taken an entire town hostage.\n\nWANDA: I'm not the one with the guns, Director.\n\nMONICA: But you are the one in control.\n\nMonica steps forward.\n\nWANDA: You're still here.\n\nAn orb of red magic hovers in Wanda's palm.\n\nMONICA: Wanda, I didn't know the drones were armed. But you know that, don't you? A town full of civilians and you, a telepath, brought a S.W.O.R.D. agent into your home. You trusted me to help deliver your babies! On some level, Wanda, you know I am an ally. I want to help you.\n\nWANDA: How? What could you possibly have to offer me?\n\nMONICA: What do you want?\n\nWANDA: I have what I want. And no one will ever take it from me again.\n\nA deep wrinkle forms between Hayward's brows and Wanda raises the orb. The soldiers' eyes glow red and they all raise their weapons at the director.\n\nHAYWARD: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, stand down!\n\nWanda stalks off.\n\nMONICA: Wanda!\n\nHAYWARD: Stand down!\n\nAs she reaches it, Wanda touches the energy field. The red glow fades from the soldiers' heads and they lower their weapons\n\nWanda disappears through the energy field and Monica gapes up at a patch of red growing upward until the entire barrier ripples up with a scarlet glow.\nCUT TO: COMMERCIAL BREAK\nA mom tries to wipe up a red liquid with a thin paper towel.\n\nNARRATOR: You've got a mess, and you're still using the next leading brand?\n\nShe looks sadly at us, disappointed with the paper towel's quality.\n\nNARRATOR: You need Lagos brand paper towels! The most absorbent paper towel available.\n\nThe husband spills a drink on the counter.\n\nNARRATOR: Husbands can use it, too!\n\nHe cleans it up, smiling at his wife.\n\nNARRATOR: Lagos! For when you make a mess you didn't mean to.\nCUT TO: WESTVIEW STREETS, DAY\nWanda and her sons walk down the middle of the street.\n\nTOMMY: Sparky! Come on, boy!\n\nBILLY: Here, boy! Sparky!\n\nThe mailman, Dennis, approaches them.\n\nDENNIS: Hey, what's the trouble, little dudes?\n\nBILLY: We can't find our dog!\n\nDENNIS: Ah, don't worry. He's sure to turn up. Your mom won't let him get far. Ma'am.\n\nHe leaves.\n\nWANDA: I don't know where he could've gone...\n\nTOMMY: Here, boy! Sparky!\n\nBILLY: Sparky! Sparky?\n\nThey see a bush rustling in front of a house.\n\nBILLY: Sparky!\n\nAgnes stands from the bushes, cradling a wrapped bundle in her arms. Billy gasps.\n\nAGNES: I... I didn't wanna come until I'd wrapped him up.\n\nWANDA: What happened to him?\n\nAGNES: Found him in my azalea bushes. Don't know how many leaves he ate. I didn't find him until it was too late.\n\nWanda walks forward, disbelieving. Agnes turns to the boys.\n\nAGNES: Oh... Tommy, Billy, I'm so sorry.\n\nThe twins share a look.\n\nWANDA: Wait. Don't. Don't.\n\nTOMMY: Don't what?\n\nWANDA: Don't age yourselves up. The urge to run from this feeling is powerful. I know.\n\nWanda puts a hand on each of their shoulders.\n\nTOMMY: It's too sad. You can fix anything, Mom. Fix the dead.\n\nWANDA: What? No.\n\nAGNES: You can do that?\n\nWanda glances at Agnes, who eyes her incredulously. Wanda turns back and crouches in front of her sons.\n\nWANDA: I am trying to tell you that there are rules in life. Okay? We can't rush aging just because it's convenient, and we can't reverse death, no matter how sad it makes us. Okay? Some things are forever.\n\nAgnes sighs, despondent.\n\nBILLY: You said family is forever.\n\nTOMMY: He is family. Bring him back, Mom.\n\nVISION: Bring who back?\n\nVision walks over. He notes their somber expressions, then Agnes holding the wrapped-up dog.\n\nVISION: Oh, boys... Come here.\n\nHe wraps his arm around them as Wanda stares ahead morosely.\nCUT TO: VISION RESIDENCE, NIGHT\nWanda clears toys off the kitchen table into a basket. She glances over her shoulder as Vision comes in through the back door and walks slowly to the sink.\n\nVISION: How are the boys?\n\nWANDA: A little heartbroken, but they'll be alright.\n\nVision washes his hands.\n\nVISION: Well, it's not often you get a dog and then bury them in the same day.\n\nWANDA: Well, life moves pretty fast out in the suburbs.\n\nWanda picks up the toy basket and moves it to a pass-through window. Vision shuts off the sink.\n\nVISION: I spoke with Norm.\n\nWANDA: Oh?\n\nVision turns, drying his hands.\n\nVISION: I unearthed the man's suppressed personality and I spoke to him free of your oversight. He was in pain, Wanda.\n\nWANDA: Vision... Listen, can we just--\n\nVISION: What? Watch TV? Turn in for the night so you can change everything over again? No, Wanda...\n\nHe walks up, leaning on the kitchen island.\n\nVISION: You can't control me the way you do them.\n\nShe gives him a challenging look.\n\nWANDA: Can't I?\n\nVision shakes his head as the credits roll. Wanda starts to leave the kitchen.\n\nWANDA: I'm going to bed.\n\nVISION: No! We're not done here. What is the Maximoff Anomaly?\n\nWANDA: The what?\n\nVision steps towards her.\n\nVISION: I have to believe that this, whatever this is, was subconscious at first and that you only recently became aware of it.\n\nWANDA: Aware of what?\n\nShe walks out. Vision follows.\n\nVISION: Norm has a family, Wanda!\n\nThe credits flicker and disappear. The music cuts out in a burst of static.\n\nVISION: He has a family, and he can't reach them because you won't let him reach them!\n\nWanda rounds on Vision.\n\nWANDA: I don't know what you're talking about!\n\nVISION: Stop lying to me!\n\nThey rise several feet off the floor.\n\nWANDA: This, all of this is for us. So let me handle it.\n\nVISION: What is outside of Westview?!\n\nWANDA: You don't wanna know, I promise you.\n\nVISION: You don't get to make that choice for me, Wanda!\n\nWANDA: You've never talked to me like this before.\n\nShe sinks back down and looks up at him.\n\nVISION: Before what? Before what?! I can't remember my life before Westview! I don't know who I am! I'm scared!\n\nWANDA: You are my husband. You are Tommy and Billy's father.\n\nVision slowly lowers to the floor and takes Wanda's hands.\n\nWANDA: Isn't that enough?\n\nHe glances outside.\n\nVISION: Wanda, why are there no other children in Westview?\n\nWANDA: Oh, God, there are! Just stop it!\n\nShe walks over to the couch and sits. Vision points out the window.\n\nVISION: No, no. The playground stands empty every morning I walk to work. Why? Tell me, why?\n\nWANDA: Do you really think that I am controlling everything?! That I- I am somehow in charge of everybody in Westview?! I'm walking their dogs, mowing their lawns, getting them to dentist appointments on time?! I mean, I...\n\nShe chuckles dryly.\n\nWANDA: I don't know how any of this started in the first place.\n\nVISION: Oh, Wanda...\n\nVision kneels next to her.\n\nVISION: What you're doing here, it's wrong.\n\nWanda shakes her head.\n\nVISION: It is wrong.\n\nThe doorbell rings. Vision looks sharply toward the front door and Wanda fixes him with an earnest stare.\n\nWANDA: I didn't do that. I--\n\nVision responds with a disbelieving look.\n\nWANDA: You don't believe me.\n\nVISION: Wanda, I want to, but at this point, I'm ignoring statistics entirely.\n\nThe doorbell rings again. Wanda looks away from her husband dully before getting up. She goes to the front door and Vision hangs back as she swings it open. Wanda's jaw drops.\nCUT TO: INT. S.W.O.R.D. COMMAND TENT, NIGHT\nDarcy rushes to her workstation. As she grabs her notebook, something on the vintage TV catches her eye and she sinks into her seat.\nCUT TO: INT. VISION RESIDENCE, NIGHT\n\nVISION: Wanda, who is this?\n\nSeen from behind, a man with bleached silver-gray hair stands on their front step.\nCUT TO: INT. S.W.O.R.D. COMMAND TENT, NIGHT\nAt her workstation, Darcy's mouth falls open.\nCUT TO: INT. VISION RESIDENCE, NIGHT\nWanda gasps. The camera angle changes to reveal Pietro. He smiles and steps inside.\n\nPIETRO: Long lost bro get to squeeze his stinkin' sister to death or what?\n\nCUT TO: INT. S.W.O.R.D. COMMAND TENT, NIGHT\n\nDARCY: She recast Pietro?\n\nCUT TO: INT.

picture it now\nSuccess in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now\nEnvisioning deeper ambitions, and now\nI'ma get to it, that is what living's about\n\n[Interlude 2]\nUh, God!\nUh\nMy voice is gone already, shit\nAlright, ayy, ayy, ayy\n\n[Verse 9]\nThink I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches\nAdolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us\nMakin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die\nMakin' you hang your head low, but say, \"Reach for the skies\"\nLife is a walkin' contradiction, I see through its lies\nI'm just tryna tell the stories I've seen through its eyes\nI feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry\nWith all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try\nYeah, everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply\nTryna sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry\nFuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, \"Why?\"\nSo I can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh\nLike, oh well, I can say that I tried\nHopped into life and then I stayed for the ride\nSo many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside\nAnd I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, damn\nThis reminds me of days when I drive in L.A.\u200b\nI'm screamin', \"Hi\" to the sky up with a smile on my face\nNow I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace\nAll of the steps that I had taken to findin' my place\nSwept out to oceans so lonely, waves feel like an embrace\nAnd now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet\nI used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic\nRecently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it\nSee my friends from kindergarten go to rehab\nThat's the type of shit that makes you think back\nTo simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds\nBefore reality could ground us, we would live in the skies\nAnd as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah)\nMan, as a kid, I never thought this would even exist\nI felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist\nAnd now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit\nYou only look at what you got once you see that it's lost\nAnd life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce\nDon't understand rappers braggin', \"I got that paper on me\"\nMan, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me\nSo what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?\nTo me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money\nRain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study\nAnd write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn\nLike Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize\nThese Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's\nThis is a natural high\nI see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies\nI wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried\nThey say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie\nThey think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid\nAs DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive\nThrew out half of my album, it wasn't good enough\nShit, I mean it still isn't good enough\nI'm like a active volcano, I know I could erupt\nBut I guess I am not full enough, damn\nI swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel\nMan, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal\nMan, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real\nThirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel\nYeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement\nYeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent\nEvery day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest\nAnd if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted\nMost of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me\nSo when I die, I know I left us with something to leave\nSo when I wake up in the morning with something to see\nYeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be\n\n[Verse 10]\nBenny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said\nIf you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous-\nMany want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant\nGot iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence\nYeah, I know I'm way too cocky\nBut I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out\nSo when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better\nThat's benefit of the doubt\nI've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom\nIt's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often\nAnd I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around\nAlways stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-\nYeah, this is freedom of speech\nTryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace\nSacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree\nOpportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-\nNah, I'm just tryna find some clarity\nApparently, it all has to do with popularity\nThere will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to\nWhat is carefully being prepared to me\nSometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity\nI'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful in the very least\n\n[Verse 11]\nGiving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see\nEveryone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy\n'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case\nShot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass\nOff of the place, brought in a way, predict what I will probably say\nAnd at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so obviously, let the audience say\nSo let me explain this to those who came in, looking at the stages\nSeeing a white kid thinking he's famous, when they don't understand\nThat I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest\nEntertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in\n\n[Verse 12]\n-Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize\nStart an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try\nThat's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'\nWith the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon\nBut I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'\nLimited ability with little humility\nBut whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me\nI'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history\nTryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me\nTryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg\nYou beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me\nShowin' up on your device, control/option/delete\nConsider myself elite, measure myself in retweets\nI be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me\nInstead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout\nI'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house\nTryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch\nI'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out\nInto reality, in normality actually happily\nFound myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?\n'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing\nNothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing\nNot complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it\nLove sleepin' and just usin' the internet\nBut my time is limited, and I better figure this\nBefore I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips\nAnd let me just tell you what I have came to do\nTryna show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to\nTryna show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo\nAnd say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through\nAnd if a major record label is looking at me\nI'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats\nI can rap fast, and rap slow\nI may make mistakes but everyone, has, so\nI'm like MJ back when he had the afro\nAlso, I'm not black, so... maybe not\nBut before everyone gets angry, stop\nI'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block\nAll the people who keep on going crazy off\n'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got\nA lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker\nWith some dominant teachers\nI deserve to be a starter, but constantly on the bleachers\nI'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager\nThey be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it\nTo know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid\nSo when you're nearin' this, please let me know\nWhen I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go\nHear the metronome combined in the compilation\nTo unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation\nBut that is just a dream, and probably a combination\nOf a big ego and false encouragement on the way in\nBut when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game\nI was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name\nBut when you think about it, it is all insane\nWhat can be created from chemicals in this brain\nBut when you look at me, you lackin' respect\nWhen I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest\nHas in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step\nUntil I'm on the same stage, and you have it again\nBut, but when you think about the hall-of-fame\nYou think about how people used to sit and call you names\nAnd you check and wonder if it will be all the same\nStep back into reality, it all remains, damn\n\n[Interlude 3]\nAlright, I just spilled water on my computer right now\nOn my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit\nHold on, uh\nGoddamn it\n\n[Verse 13]\nMy lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean\nThis is off the top, I don't need to use no machines\nHold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever\nBut I am very clever, okay, okay\nI'm gonna take a drink, if you're watchin' this, take a drink too\nThese are some shit' that you can drink to\nBut drink water unless you're of age\nYou know what I'm sayin'? Ayy\n\n[Interlude 4]\nOkay, okay\nUh\nUh\nAyy\n\n[Verse 14]\nI feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous\n-Most of humanity's made of idiots\nI barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?\nYou think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?\nPlease... what I do is barely poetry\nThere's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me\nBut still consider me confident\nStill consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness\nBut honestly, all of this is haunting me, probably\nIt is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling\nInto awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'\nIt's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening\nIt's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake\nI close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away\nYeah, we're just tryna find that great escape\nTo get away from how we're living life day-to-day\nSome people find it in a drink or in a cup\nOr in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love\nBut all I know is that it's tough\nAnd all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much\n\n[Verse 15]\nI'm young and ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?\nThese kid-haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players\nThat shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low\nGot amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be lyin', but I came to show\nWhat I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype\nAnd I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life\n-Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights\nAhead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night\n-Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass\n-Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast\nRemember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it\nAnd say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected\nTake a deep breath, 'cause I need that\nMost of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast\nMy bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors\nYou want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards\nSay that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this\nI'm singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit\nTryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day\n'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?\nI'm making the most of a crazier flow, so many ways it could go\nI'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home, I'm willing to make it my own\nI'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it, even if staying up late is the needed bit\nReason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it, leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch\nMeaning, these people ain't feelin' rich, reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it\nPleasin' these liars, they've peaked, and so now they're recedin' agreein' to be a live without leading it\nFlow's so dope, I think it's time that we take a break\nWe all make mistakes and play some hate, I got 808s here to save the day\n'Cause I am on top of it, lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it\nYou know my flow is so dominant, positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments\nAll of these offers is boring as fuck, though I am not a part of 'em\nStart a new part to the charts and I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it\nBreaking it up, like cartilage, flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it\nI know that you hate to admit it, but really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'\nUnder the radar, you don't know what's comin', I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'\nI found to be part of a little of something called love, and I guess that's the art of it\nI try to go slow, but it don't work\n-Gettin' better, and that don't hurt, and you think I'm dead, and you're sure\nYou're salty and not kosher, slave to the corporates and the owners\nThis is live and love, call it Shrek, like the ogre\nHah, bitch, I have had enough, and I am sure I ain't mad enough\nForgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success, and I look at the numbers, I add 'em up\nMy chart is like a parabola, thank you a lot for havin' us\nAnd so, every day, I take one step up, man, I am takin' the ladder up\n-Hundred K- get the plaque, lookin' forward, not heading back\nRemember what I had said is that we ain't givin' up, remember that\nHit me up when you're done whining, I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming\nListen up, 'cause I'm combining all my skills into one finding\nWe run, grinding, you know we do, we got the shit that we're goin' through\nThese lyrics go over you, you  don't listen, so you don't know it's true\n'Cause we in, and we've done it, thousands, now we a hundred\nShoutout to Didac and Momo and the others\nShit, I consider them brothers, shit, I consider you all are my family\nShoutout to those who will stand with me, even when all of the others abandon me\nYeah, drama, we move past that, now I look at you with the last laugh\nBetter trackback, now I rap fast, so many skills in my backpack\nStarted off so terribly, now all of these people compare to me\nIn the past, I never anticipated what there would be\nAnd see ya, so long now, off to the end of the song now\nSee ya next at five-hundred and a million, it's on now\n\n[Interlude 5]\nIt's on now\nOh shit, I'm almost out of water\nThis is a hard- this a- real challenge\nThis like, physically difficult, ayy\n\n[Hook 4]\nWhen I walk up in the scene, I hear a orchestra\nNow everybody telling me I don't perform enough\nMy math teacher told me that I'd never be shit\nAnd now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula\nI got the formula, I got the formula\nYou got the sauce, but goddamn, I got the formula, ayy\nPeople always asking Ben, \"Why you record so much?\"\nI got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up\n\n[Verse 16]\nFormula, like I'm Mr. Krabs\nI change and transform it up, you stuck in the past\nYeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab\nUh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag\nAnd now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'\nPeople love to criticize me for the life I've had\nThey make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'\nI make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, ayy\nUh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie\nAnd I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami\nWanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'\nTryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies\nAyy, still saying, \"Who would'a thought?\", like, who would'a guessed it?\nHaven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing\nIf you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:\nWant the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook\n\n[Verse 17]\nAyy, they doubt a fucker with a dream\nLooking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah\nLooking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens\nSerpent's told you, \"No,\" and it's like nothing's as it seems\nGod damn, I guess I really thought he was the man\nI guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham\nAll that cash he stocked was from a scam\nAll the views he got was from some spam\nI've been living like, \"Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?\nWhy ain't he just sticking to the plan?\nHow has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?\"\nI don't get it, I don't really understand\nI've been living like, \"Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram\nI'll do better if I study my exams, do I really wanna stand\nNext to all these average fucking sad duds?\"\nSo I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one\n\n[Hook 5]\nYeah\nHate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one\nAyy\nJust because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup\nUh, uh, uh\nFeel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones\nAnd so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he\n\n[Verse 18]\n'Cause he been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine\nI've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap\nThat shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now\nI'm making a- minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I'm needin' to figure this out\nHow did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday\nAnd I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away\nBut I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun\nSo I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one\n\n[Verse 19]\nBy now, if you're still watching this shit\nYou are a boss and you deserve some applause for this shit\nBut we ain't over, we ain't done, though\nAm I takin' a break? Are you dumb, bro?\nWell, we nearin' 10K, but I still need 30K\nWhile all you sit around, I would rather work than play\nLyrics go through your dome, through your vertebrae\nHit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates\n\n[Interlude 6]\nThat was actually a pretty good bar\nI just wrote that like, right- a second ago, before I recorded this\nAyy, ayy\nYou know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh\n\n[Hook 6]\nSometimes, I don't know what to think\nSometimes, I don't know what'll\nMake it okay, make it okay\nI'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, ayy\n\n[Verse 20]\nUh, I wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering\nAll these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen\nAll accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence\nOften is the result of falling under consciousness\nYou'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives\nYou're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie\nAnd I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty\nFearing that, one day ,you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me\nNo, will I tell you? No, never- I think I'm so clever\nBut in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better\nBut I don't ever\nWant to go to show, just one mo' letter\nI'm a go-getter, I go get A's and get grades\nAnd get A's, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid\nUh... my life is so unusual\nTo most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable\nCan't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral\nI'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero\nUh, but you know that I'm capable\nYou know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available\nFeeling so unique and I think it's not explainable\nNo one hears my lyrics, and says, \"OMG, relatable!\"\nNo, that's not what I'm here to give\nBeen waiting years for this, you're about to experience\nSomething that I've spent time, money and thought on\nLearned about all the times money had thought wrong\nKinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long\nI ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot\n-Out on the inside, see me on the outside\nAlways think I'm positive, and never see the downsides\nIt's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it\nGet your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it\n\n[Interlude 7]\nOkay\nOkay, okay, we're like thirty minutes in\nThirty minutes, but we got thirty-thousand, bro\nFuck\n\n[Verse 21]\nYeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware\nI'm like the 'e' that equals all other emcees squared\nI'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs\nBut y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared\nI got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of it\nShoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip\nMan, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders\nIt's not about who goes faster, but it's 'bout the man who'll hold his grip\nDamn, I got a crazy ass work ethic\nBlocked out south east and west, leave in one direction\nI finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it\nFuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection\nWe all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons\nLike a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'\nWanted to fuck a nun, started like really badly\nAnd I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar\nCan't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'\nYeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person\nI base my motivation on my favorite angels words a-\n-bout how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, that thing's for certain\n\n[Verse 22]\nYou keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high\nWanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy\nCan't deny I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize\nHow it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize\nAnd analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed\nAnd take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise\nAmerica is very nice, but I'd like to see the world\nBut I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl\n\n[Verse 23]\nIn a Mercedes Benz with his lady friends\nCrazy Ben is just chillin' with them women, you know they be tens\nThey be tens or more, they be tens or more\nI like to talk to all these people 'cause they marvel at my metaphors\nIt's free speech, I can say what I want\nBut these listenin' are tryna make me pay for my talk\nThey don't like what I'm doin', they don't appreciate the banter\nI get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh\nMotherfucker, I'ma live for the right time\nFuck that, I'ma live for the moment\nSitting here in the middle of the night time\nMy mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowin'\nDamn, I've been livin' in a headache\nBitches never listenin', they saying that they ready\nBut I can never believe them\nGot these goals and they can never achieve 'em\nHow can your dreams come true if you ain't willin' to dream 'em?\nDamn, that's a lot of shit to think about\nSuddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering\nWhat I'm doin', next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out\nMade some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh\nGot these dreams that I'm livin' out\nIn my mind's eye, givin' out lots of songs with responses\nThat I never pictured, wow, damn, damn\nThis beat's way too holy to rap over\nMental block, my mind's capacities, that's lower\nYour raps slower, they lack closure, they lack substance\nLike a printer without toner, y'all fillin' pages that have nothin'\nOoh, but I have got somethin' to tell you\nI ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you\nSpeakin' from late nights, I'm thinkin' of Drake's life\nWatching these interviews, thinkin' one day I might\nBe on that stage right beside all these players\nShit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers\nI'll prove it in music I use to influence\nI do this way harder than people assumin'\nResumin' my writin', viewin' this lightin'\nThat puts me to be in the view of the hidin'\nI do what they're likin', but that makes 'em hate me\nNo matter what I do, they just mistake the\nReason I'm flowin', the reason I start up\nNot just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks\nAnd- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place\nMost to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste\nI'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh\nI just need a home run, I already loaded bases\nI have got so many cases\nBeen visiting, living in so many places\nExperiences that I made me to Emmy\nBen, B-E-N, please, I hope you let me\nBe me, I ain't greedy or needy\nBelieve me, I just want to be on your TV\nGet on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase\nDamn, yeah, I've been looking at their space\nAnd, one day, I'll be there\nI know what I'm doin', I'm already prepared\n\n[Verse 24]\nI've been waiting like thirty-thousand years\nTryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear\nI'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career\nI'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here\nNow I earned it, and I'm here to stay\nI'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play\nNot even seventeen, eighteen, I'm so near to fame\nNot really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day\nI don't know- I look at the future nostalgically\nI'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me\nUndoubtably know how to be what I am about to be\nTo say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me\n\n[Verse 25]\nRecently, I have been feeling alienated\nMy songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em\nBut, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different\nHate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it\n\n[Verse 26]\nPeople say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen\nAll will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene\nY'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty\nPromise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?\nTrapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages\nWhen I would rap on the stages, and now, I laugh at those days, and\nI'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song\nMove along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns\nWho could bomb this whole place up with one great lung?\nOne great tongue, I am that one great one\nOn vacation, I vacate to a location\nFar away from where people just may run\nA light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun\nOh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young\nI can murder this beat with no gun, go run\nI've too many problems to handle, here, hold one\nI just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks\nAnd now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk\nWas a great song, catchy at first, but that radio station\nPlaying it, making it just get to the worst\nMy head's gonna burst if I hear it again, and I'm sure\nI'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth\nAnd now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it\nNow the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah\n\n[Verse 27]\nGood rappers never get to see the light of day\nBut when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away\nI'll obey... nah, whatever, man, what is this?\nI'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business\nNobody witness anything better than when I am showing you this shit\nKnow I'm suspicious, because I'll be flowing and growing like, \"Oh, this kid is big\"\nKnow how I live it, go on a mission, y'all better

I said, it's scary for a king, even\nThey call me odd, but I bring even\nI bring reason to believe, and you're eatin' it up for free, and\nThe meaning is rarely seen and no line can be drawn between 'em, I don't show seasons\nYeah, I am me no matter what, and that can grow pleasin'\nI'm barely close to anybody, I don't know people\nMan, I don't know people who so equal\nI don't know nobody who doesn't own evil\nMan, that is just a truth and a lie\nA truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky\nOr a suit and a tie, yeah, I'm new to this life, I'm new to my mind\nNew to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise\nAnd uh, I'm- lookin' at all of this shit\nOh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this\nYou get discouraged for one minute\nAnd the next one, you be callin' it quits\nAnd I'll probably get rich If I focus enough\nYou close-minded, let's open it up\nAnd all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'\nBut they do not know what is up\nUh, I just wish\nThat they'd go away\nAnd I won't obey\nNo, I will never ever show the way\nAnd I will try to mask it up\nWith other jokes on fucking jokes\nAlways playin' G'\nBut now I'm movin' onto other notes\n\n[Interlude 16]\nMy voice is fucking hurting\nIt's hurting a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training\nSo I don't know how to- just do this for a long period of time\nWithout causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?\nMan, I just live it up\nI'm gonna go a little bit quieter now\nUh-huh\nYeah\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAll of these people keep on changin'\nAll of these times and different phases\nAll of these lights on all these stages\nAll of these sights is so amazing\nYeah, I've seen at least a million faces\nA million times, a million places\nBut when it's all said and done\nI look and I wonder why, uh\n\n[Verse 43]\nEveryone knows that it's so amazing\nAll the support is my motivation\nCompared to the big people at the Capital\nMy name is spelt in lower cases\nPeople loved me before I made it\nPeople liked it before they watched it\nI'm wantin' way too much more than I have\nAnd I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it\nMan on a mission, and I g- vision\nOf talking a lot of wisdom, man, I gotta listen\nGotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow\nI'll be the teacher when they need the feature\nGot flow, and it's so damn crazy\nPeople consider me so amazing\nI'm holding control and then folding them verses\nIt hurts because I am on loaded bases\nAdvanced shit, I know the basics\nAlready know them, they're overrated\nMeanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hopin'\n'Cause now I am open for game, and\nI'm charged up\nI ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior\nSo many people they know the players\nDon't know the game and don't know the makers\nDon't know the fakers, but who cares?\nI'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater\nI'm here to go move and just go on the layers\nAnd bitch, I am going so later\nI got time\nMy own lyrics, I got mine\nAnd I'm on time for the wrong lines\nAnd I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go\n\n[Hook 14]\nI've been all on my own\nAll on my own, people keep calling my phone\nWanting to know when I'll be the star of the show\nBut I'm all my own, yeah\nAnd I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it\n'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-\nThe ghost of me is haunting the throne\nSo I'll make it there all on my own\n\n[Verse 44]\nMy intermission is mixing with intermissions\nAnd following intuition conflicting with my decision\nAnd it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval\nAnd it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful\nAnd it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you\nAppearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement\nTo a new type of thing that you can gain from\nTo push away the past and the places that you came from\nDay one for me was like six months ago-\n\n[Interlude 17]\nOh, holy shit!\nI actually reached the end of the beat\nBut I still have, like\nTen-thousand more words\nHold on, I gotta pause this\nHold on, three, it's still one take\n\n[Verse 45]\n-Past and the places that you came from\nDay one for me was like six months ago\nLook at where we been, but imagine where one can go\nIt's not fun to know that we just livin' to die\nIt's not fun to know that we just livin' to die\nWe now know how much money you can give for a lie\nGive for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?\nWhat's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?\nSo, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen\nAlways been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man\n\n[Hook 15]\nYeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch\nUh, I ain't the star of the show, bitch\n\n[Verse 46]\nI know like four people who truly respect the grind\nAnd it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme\nAnd then if time is money then free time ain't really free\nAnd all my fan' pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me\n-Stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree\nI want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me\nIn the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me\nBigger than you, bigger than anybody in history\nThe challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize\nTo satisfy your lavish life and have a crazy magic time\nAnd luckily, I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time\nTo learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind\nI'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got\nSeveral different things to potentially make my job\nI want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs\nAnd also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks\nA million- shit, all we ever want is more, really\nAnd once I get three million, I want four milli'\nIt's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle\nWe can never be happy, but that is so vital\n\n[Interlude 18]\nUh\nThose are actually some good lyrics, uh\n\n[Verse 47]\nRebirth, feet hit the earth, my knees hurt\nThey're weaker than previously, her\nBreathing seems to be burnt like

more than a Chevy\nI play- I play-\n-Who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy?\nUh, I've been tryin' to prove to all of the people I knew who didn't like what I do\nDisgusted like, \"Ew\", yeah, this shit goes outta you, plans have now all become true\nI'm seeing them through, man, that's the reason I do, all of the things that I do\nIt's not for a crew, not for a god or a demon, I've really been needing a clue\nFillin' these shoes, reading these pieces and news, damn, this shit really is screwed\nIt gives me the blues whenever I'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh\nBut if ignorance is really bliss, then why this ignorance be killin' kids?\nAnd why this ignorance that's clearly vicious is not given shit and ends up innocent?\nThat shit really is ridiculous, it's magnificently fucked up\nBut nobody wants to tough it up, I haven't seen it goin' down, it's comin' up\nL\u2014\n\n[Verse 48]\n\u2014cay to the Vatican, havin' them\nGood times and bad times with New Romans, do that again, well, that was when\nI was so young, too young to really know fun\nBut so what? I guess that's what happens when you grow up\nDry your eyes and wipe your nose up\nJust keep drinking till you throw up, no, we won't judge\nBut we all just want to be loved and somehow get validated by those we hate\nSuch a twisted system that we've been given to operate\nI've been really thinkin' and figurin' out who's not a fake\nWash away the thoughts I made along the way, it all has changed\nYeah, and now we lookin', it's so far away\nAnd it's so far away\n\n[Hook 16]\nThis a civil war\nIt's a fuckin' civil war\nYeah, we be aimin' to the peace\nSo what we killin' for?\nYeah,

surroundin' me, I need to go home, so\nCan I pretty please just be al-alone?\nNobody to retweet, delete on my home phone\nI ain't gon'-I ain't gon' hop on that drug shit\nWhen they all claimin' they

There is no one for him to make friends with nowadays; but if we turn to the past, the long list of his famous friends winds up with such names as Pirogov, Kavelin, and the poet Nekrasov, all of whom bestowed upon him a warm and sincere affection. He is a member of all the Russian and of three foreign universities. And so on, and so on. All that and a great deal more that might be said makes up what is called my \"name.\"\n\nThat is my name as known to the public. In Russia it is known to every educated man, and abroad it is mentioned in the lecture-room with the addition \"honoured and distinguished.\" It is one of those fortunate names to abuse which or to take which in vain, in public or in print, is considered a sign of bad taste. And that is as it should be. You see, my name is closely associated with the conception of a highly distinguished man of great gifts and unquestionable usefulness. I have the industry and power of endurance of a camel, and that is important, and I have talent, which is even more important. Moreover, while I am on this subject, I am a well-educated, modest, and honest fellow. I have never poked my nose into literature or politics; I have never sought popularity in polemics with the ignorant; I have never made speeches either at public dinners or at the funerals of my friends.... In fact, there is no slur on my learned name, and there is no complaint one can make against it. It is fortunate.\n\nThe bearer of that name, that is I, see myself as a man of sixty-two, with a bald head, with false teeth, and with an incurable tic douloureux. I am myself as dingy and unsightly as my name is brilliant and splendid. My head and my hands tremble with weakness; my neck, as Turgenev says of one of his heroines, is like the handle of a double bass; my chest is hollow; my shoulders narrow; when I talk or lecture, my mouth turns down at one corner; when I smile, my whole face is covered with aged-looking, deathly wrinkles. There is nothing impressive about my pitiful figure; only, perhaps, when I have an attack of tic douloureux my face wears a peculiar expression, the sight of which must have roused in every one the grim and impressive thought, \"Evidently that man will soon die.\"\n\nI still, as in the past, lecture fairly well; I can still, as in the past, hold the attention of my listeners for a couple of hours. My fervour, the literary skill of my exposition, and my humour, almost efface the defects of my voice, though it is harsh, dry, and monotonous as a praying beggar's. I write poorly. That bit of my brain which presides over the faculty of authorship refuses to work. My memory has grown weak; there is a lack of sequence in my ideas, and when I put them on paper it always seems to me that I have lost the instinct for their organic connection; my construction is monotonous; my language is poor and timid. Often I write what I do not mean; I have forgotten the beginning when I am writing the end. Often I forget ordinary words, and I always have to waste a great deal of energy in avoiding superfluous phrases and unnecessary parentheses in my letters, both unmistakable proofs of a decline in mental activity. And it is noteworthy that the simpler the letter the more painful the effort to write it. At a scientific article I feel far more intelligent and at ease than at a letter of congratulation or a minute of proceedings. Another point: I find it easier to write German or English than to write Russian.\n\nAs regards my present manner of life, I must give a foremost place to the insomnia from which I have suffered of late. If I were asked what constituted the chief and fundamental feature of my existence now, I should answer, Insomnia. As in the past, from habit I undress and go to bed exactly at midnight. I fall asleep quickly, but before two o'clock I wake up and feel as though I had not slept at all. Sometimes I get out of bed and light a lamp. For an hour or two I walk up and down the room looking at the familiar photographs and pictures. When I am weary of walking about, I sit down to my table. I sit motionless, thinking of nothing, conscious of no inclination; if a book is lying before me, I mechanically move it closer and read it without any interest\u2014in that way not long ago I mechanically read through in one night a whole novel, with the strange title \"The Song the Lark was Singing\"; or to occupy my attention I force myself to count to a thousand; or I imagine the face of one of my colleagues and begin trying to remember in what year and under what circumstances he entered the service. I like listening to sounds. Two rooms away from me my daughter Liza says something rapidly in her sleep, or my wife crosses the drawing-room with a candle and invariably drops the matchbox; or a warped cupboard creaks; or the burner of the lamp suddenly begins to hum\u2014and all these sounds, for some reason, excite me.\n\nTo lie awake at night means to be at every moment conscious of being abnormal, and so I look forward with impatience to the morning and the day when I have a right to be awake. Many wearisome hours pass before the cock crows in the yard. He is my first bringer of good tidings. As soon as he crows I know that within an hour the porter will wake up below, and, coughing angrily, will go upstairs to fetch something. And then a pale light will begin gradually glimmering at the windows, voices will sound in the street....\nThe day begins for me with the entrance of my wife. She comes in to me in her petticoat, before she has done her hair, but after she has washed, smelling of flower-scented eau-de-Cologne, looking as though she had come in by chance. Every time she says exactly the same thing: \"Excuse me, I have just come in for a minute.... Have you had a bad night again?\"\n\nThen she puts out the lamp, sits down near the table, and begins talking. I am no prophet, but I know what she will talk about. Every morning it is exactly the same thing. Usually, after anxious inquiries concerning my health, she suddenly mentions our son who is an officer serving at Warsaw. After the twentieth of each month we send him fifty roubles, and that serves as the chief topic of our conversation.\n\n\"Of course it is difficult for us,\" my wife would sigh, \"but until he is completely on his own feet it is our duty to help him. The boy is among strangers, his pay is small.... However, if you like, next month we won't send him fifty, but forty. What do you think?\"\n\nDaily experience might have taught my wife that constantly talking of our expenses does not reduce them, but my wife refuses to learn by experience, and regularly every morning discusses our officer son, and tells me that bread, thank God, is cheaper, while sugar is a halfpenny dearer\u2014with a tone and an air as though she were communicating interesting news.\n\nI listen, mechanically assent, and probably because I have had a bad night, strange and inappropriate thoughts intrude themselves upon me. I gaze at my wife and wonder like a child. I ask myself in perplexity, is it possible that this old, very stout, ungainly woman, with her dull expression of petty anxiety and alarm about daily bread, with eyes dimmed by continual brooding over debts and money difficulties, who can talk of nothing but expenses and who smiles at nothing but things getting cheaper\u2014is it possible that this woman is no other than the slender Varya whom I fell in love with so passionately for her fine, clear intelligence, for her pure soul, her beauty, and, as Othello his Desdemona, for her \"sympathy\" for my studies? Could that woman be no other than the Varya who had once borne me a son?\n\nI look with strained attention into the face of this flabby, spiritless, clumsy old woman, seeking in her my Varya, but of her past self nothing is left but her anxiety over my health and her manner of calling my salary \"our salary,\" and my cap \"our cap.\" It is painful for me to look at her, and, to give her what little comfort I can, I let her say what she likes, and say nothing even when she passes unjust criticisms on other people or pitches into me for not having a private practice or not publishing text-books.\n\nOur conversation always ends in the same way. My wife suddenly remembers with dismay that I have not had my tea.\n\n\"What am I thinking about, sitting here?\" she says, getting up. \"The samovar has been on the table ever so long, and here I stay gossiping. My goodness! how forgetful I am growing!\"\n\nShe goes out quickly, and stops in the doorway to say:\n\n\"We owe Yegor five months' wages. Did you know it? You mustn't let the servants' wages run on; how many times I have said it! It's much easier to pay ten roubles a month than fifty roubles every five months!\"\n\nAs she goes out, she stops to say:\n\n\"The person I am sorriest for is our Liza. The girl studies at the Conservatoire, always mixes with people of good position, and goodness knows how she is dressed. Her fur coat is in such a state she is ashamed to show herself in the street. If she were somebody else's daughter it wouldn't matter, but of course every one knows that her father is a distinguished professor, a privy councillor.\"\n\nAnd having reproached me with my rank and reputation, she goes away at last. That is how my day begins. It does not improve as it goes on.\nAs I am drinking my tea, my Liza comes in wearing her fur coat and her cap, with her music in her hand, already quite ready to go to the Conservatoire. She is two-and-twenty. She looks younger, is pretty, and rather like my wife in her young days. She kisses me tenderly on my forehead and on my hand, and says:\n\n\"Good-morning, papa; are you quite well?\"\n\nAs a child she was very fond of ice-cream, and I used often to take her to a confectioner's. Ice-cream was for her the type of everything delightful. If she wanted to praise me she would say: \"You are as nice as cream, papa.\" We used to call one of her little fingers \"pistachio ice,\" the next, \"cream ice,\" the third \"raspberry,\" and so on. Usually when she came in to say good-morning to me I used to sit her on my knee, kiss her little fingers, and say:\n\n\"Creamy ice... pistachio... lemon....\"\n\nAnd now, from old habit, I kiss Liza's fingers and mutter: \"Pistachio... cream... lemon...\" but the effect is utterly different. I am cold as ice and I am ashamed. When my daughter comes in to me and touches my forehead with her lips I start as though a bee had stung me on the head, give a forced smile, and turn my face away. Ever since I have been suffering from sleeplessness, a question sticks in my brain like a nail. My daughter often sees me, an old man and a distinguished man, blush painfully at being in debt to my footman; she sees how often anxiety over petty debts forces me to lay aside my work and to walk u p and down the room for hours together, thinking; but why is it she never comes to me in secret to whisper in my ear: \"Father, here is my watch, here are my bracelets, my earrings, my dresses.... Pawn them all; you want money...\"? How is it that, seeing how her mother and I are placed in a false position and do our utmost to hide our poverty from people, she does not give up her expensive pleasure of music lessons? I would not accept her watch nor her bracelets, nor the sacrifice of her lessons\u2014God forbid! That isn't what I want.\n\nI think at the same time of my son, the officer at Warsaw. He is a clever, honest, and sober fellow. But that is not enough for me. I think if I had an old father, and if I knew there were moments when he was put to shame by his poverty, I should give up my officer's commission to somebody else, and should go out to earn my living as a workman. Such thoughts about my children poison me. What is the use of them? It is only a narrow-minded or embittered man who can harbour evil thoughts about ordinary people because they are not heroes. But enough of that!\n\nAt a quarter to ten I have to go and give a lecture to my dear boys. I dress and walk along the road which I have known for thirty years, and which has its history for me. Here is the big grey house with the chemist's shop; at this point there used to stand a little house, and in it was a beershop; in that beershop I thought out my thesis and wrote my first love-letter to Varya. I wrote it in pencil, on a page headed \"Historia morbi.\" Here there is a grocer's shop; at one time it was kept by a little Jew, who sold me cigarettes on credit; then by a fat peasant woman, who liked the students because \"every one of them has a mother\"; now there is a red-haired shopkeeper sitting in it, a very stolid man who drinks tea from a copper teapot. And here are the gloomy gates of the University, which have long needed doing up; I see the bored porter in his sheep-skin, the broom, the drifts of snow.... On a boy coming fresh from the provinces and imagining that the temple of science must really be a temple, such gates cannot make a healthy impression. Altogether the dilapidated condition of the University buildings, the gloominess of the corridors, the griminess of the walls, the lack of light, the dejected aspect of the steps, the hat-stands and the benches, take a prominent position among predisposing causes in the history of Russian pessimism.... Here is our garden... I fancy it has grown neither better nor worse since I was a student. I don't like it. It would be far more sensible if there were tall pines and fine oaks growing here instead of sickly-looking lime-trees, yellow acacias, and skimpy pollard lilacs. The student whose state of mind is in the majority of cases created by his surroundings, ought in the place where he is studying to see facing him at every turn nothing but what is lofty, strong and elegant.... God preserve him from gaunt trees, broken windows, grey walls, and doors covered with torn American leather!\n\nWhen I go to my own entrance the door is flung wide open, and I am met by my colleague, contemporary, and namesake, the porter Nikolay. As he lets me in he clears his throat and says:\n\n\"A frost, your Excellency!\"\n\nOr, if my great-coat is wet:\n\n\"Rain, your Excellency!\"\n\nThen he runs on ahead of me and opens all the doors on my way. In my study he carefully takes off my fur coat, and while doing so manages to tell me some bit of University news. Thanks to the close intimacy existing between all the University porters and beadles, he knows everything that goes on in the four faculties, in the office, in the rector's private room, in the library. What does he not know? When in an evil day a rector or dean, for instance, retires, I hear him in conversation with the young porters mention the candidates for the post, explain that such a one would not be confirmed by the minister, that another would himself refuse to accept it, then drop into fantastic details concerning mysterious papers received in the office, secret conversations alleged to have taken place between the minister and the trustee, and so on. With the exception of these details, he almost always turns out to be right. His estimates of the candidates, though original, are very correct, too. If one wants to know in what year some one read his thesis, entered the service, retired, or died, then summon to your assistance the vast memory of that soldier, and he will not only tell you the year, the month and the day, but will furnish you also with the details that accompanied this or that event. Only one who loves can remember like that.\nHe is the guardian of the University traditions. From the porters who were his predecessors he has inherited many legends of University life, has added to that wealth much of his own gained during his time of service, and if you care to hear he will tell you many long and intimate stories. He can tell one about extraordinary sages who knew everything, about remarkable students who did not sleep for weeks, about numerous martyrs and victims of science; with him good triumphs over evil, the weak always vanquishes the strong, the wise man the fool, the humble the proud, the young the old. There is no need to take all these fables and legends for sterling coin; but filter them, and you will have left what is wanted: our fine traditions and the names of real heroes, recognized as such by all.\n\nIn our society the knowledge of the learned world consists of anecdotes of the extraordinary absentmindedness of certain old professors, and two or three witticisms variously ascribed to Gruber, to me, and to Babukin. For the educated public that is not much. If it loved science, learned men, and students, as Nikolay does, its literature would long ago have contained whole epics, records of sayings and doings such as, unfortunately, it cannot boast of now.\n\nAfter telling me a piece of news, Nikolay assumes a severe expression, and conversation about business begins. If any outsider could at such times overhear Nikolay's free use of our terminology, he might perhaps imagine that he was a learned man disguised as a soldier. And, by the way, the rumours of the erudition of the University porters are greatly exaggerated. It is true that Nikolay knows more than a hundred Latin words, knows how to put the skeleton together, sometimes prepares the apparatus and amuses the students by some long, learned quotation, but the by no means complicated theory of the circulation of the blood, for instance, is as much a mystery to him now as it was twenty years ago.\n\nAt the table in my study, bending low over some book or preparation, sits Pyotr Ignatyevitch, my demonstrator, a modest and industrious but by no means clever man of five-and-thirty, already bald and corpulent; he works from morning to night, reads a lot, remembers well everything he has read\u2014and in that way he is not a man, but pure gold; in all else he is a carthorse or, in other words, a learned dullard. The carthorse characteristics that show his lack of talent are these: his outlook is narrow and sharply limited by his specialty; outside his special branch he is simple as a child.\n\n\"Fancy! what a misfortune! They say Skobelev is dead.\"\n\nNikolay crosses himself, but Pyotr Ignatyevitch turns to me and asks:\n\n\"What Skobelev is that?\"\n\nAnother time\u2014somewhat earlier\u2014I told him that Professor Perov was dead. Good Pyotr Ignatyevitch asked:\n\n\"What did he lecture on?\"\n\nI believe if Patti had sung in his very ear, if a horde of Chinese had invaded Russia, if there had been an earthquake, he would not have stirred a limb, but screwing up his eye, would have gone on calmly looking through his microscope. What is he to Hecuba or Hecuba to him, in fact? I would give a good deal to see how this dry stick sleeps with his wife at night.\n\nAnother characteristic is his fanatical faith in the infallibility of science, and, above all, of everything written by the Germans. He believes in himself, in his preparations; knows the object of life, and knows nothing of the doubts and disappointments that turn the hair o f talent grey. He has a slavish reverence for authorities and a complete lack of any desire for independent thought. To change his convictions is difficult, to argue with him impossible. How is one to argue with a man who is firmly persuaded that medicine is the finest of sciences, that doctors are the best of men, and that the traditions of the medical profession are superior to those of any other? Of the evil past of medicine only one tradition has been preserved\u2014the white tie still worn by doctors; for a learned\u2014in fact, for any educated man the only traditions that can exist are those of the University as a whole, with no distinction between medicine, law, etc. But it would be hard for Pyotr Ignatyevitch to accept these facts, and he is ready to argue with you till the day of judgment.\n\nI have a clear picture in my mind of his future. In the course of his life he will prepare many hundreds of chemicals of exceptional purity; he will write a number of dry and very accurate memoranda, will make some dozen conscientious translations, but he won't do anything striking. To do that one must have imagination, inventiveness, the gift of insight, and Pyotr Ignatyevitch has nothing of the kind. In short, he is not a master in science, but a journeyman.\n\nPyotr Ignatyevitch, Nikolay, and I, talk in subdued tones. We are not quite ourselves. There is always a peculiar feeling when one hears through the doors a murmur as of the sea from the lecture-theatre. In the course of thirty years I have not grown accustomed to this feeling, and I experience it every morning. I nervously button up my coat, ask Nikolay unnecessary questions, lose my temper.... It is just as though I were frightened; it is not timidity, though, but something different which I can neither describe nor find a name for.\n\nQuite unnecessarily, I look at my watch and say: \"Well, it's time to go in.\"\n\nAnd we march into the room in the following order: foremost goes Nikolay, with the chemicals and apparatus or with a chart; after him I come; and then the carthorse follows humbly, with hanging head; or, when necessary, a dead body is carried in first on a stretcher, followed by Nikolay, and so on. On my entrance the students all stand up, then they sit down, and the sound as of the sea is suddenly hushed. Stillness reigns.\n\nI know what I am going to lecture about, but I don't know how I am going to lecture, where I am going to begin or with what I am going to end. I haven't a single sentence ready in my head. But I have only to look round the lecture-hall (it is built in the form of an amphitheatre) and utter the stereotyped phrase, \"Last lecture we stopped at...\" when sentences spring up from my soul in a long string, and I am carried away by my own eloquence. I speak with irresistible rapidity and passion, and it seems as though there were no force which could check the flow of my words. To lecture well\u2014that is, with profit to the listeners and without boring them\u2014one must have, besides talent, experience and a special knack; one must possess a clear conception of one's own powers, of the audience to which one is lecturing, and of the subject of one's lecture. Moreover, one must be a man who knows what he is doing; one must keep a sharp lookout, and not for one second lose sight of what lies before one.\n\nA good conductor, interpreting the thought of the composer, does twenty things at once: reads the score, waves his baton, watches the singer, makes a motion sideways, first to the drum then to the wind-instruments, and so on. I do just the same when I lecture. Before me a hundred and fifty faces, all unlike one another; three hundred eyes all looking straight into my face. My object is to dominate this many-headed monster. If every moment as I lecture I have a clear vision of the degree of its attention and its power of comprehension, it is in my power. The other foe I have to overcome is in myself. It is the infinite variety of forms, phenomena, laws, and the multitude of ideas of my own and other people's conditioned by them. Every moment I must have the skill to snatch out of that vast mass of material what is most important and necessary, and, as rapidly as my words flow, clothe my thought in a form in which it can be grasped by the monster's intelligence, and may arouse its attention, and at the same time one must keep a sharp lookout that one's thoughts are conveyed, not just as they come, but in a certain order, essential for the correct composition of the picture I wish to sketch. Further, I endeavour to make my diction literary, my definitions brief and precise, my wording, as far as possible, simple and eloquent. Every minute I have to pull myself up and remember that I have only an hour and forty minutes at my disposal. In short, one has one's work cut out. At one and the same minute one has to play the part of savant and teacher and orator, and it's a bad thing if the orator gets the upper hand of the savant or of the teacher in one, or vice versa.\n\nYou lecture for a quarter of an hour, for half an hour, when you notice that the students are beginning to look at the ceiling, at Pyotr Ignatyevitch; one is feeling for his handkerchief, another shifts in his seat, another smiles at his thoughts.... That means that their attention is flagging. Something must be done. Taking advantage of the first opportunity, I make some pun. A broad grin comes on to a hundred and fifty faces, the eyes shine brightly, the sound of the sea is audible for a brief moment.... I laugh too. Their attention is refreshed, and I can go on.\n\nNo kind of sport, no kind of game or diversion, has ever given me such enjoyment as lecturing. Only at lectures have I been able to abandon myself entirely to passion, and have understood that inspiration is not an invention of the poets, but exists in real life, and I imagine Hercules after the most piquant of his exploits felt just such voluptuous exhaustion as I experience after every lecture.\n\nThat was in old times. Now at lectures I feel nothing but torture. Before half an hour is over I am conscious of an overwhelming weakness in my legs and my shoulders. I sit down in my chair, but I am not accustomed to lecture sitting down; a minute later I get up and go on standing, then sit down again. There is a dryness in my mouth, my voice grows husky, my head begins to go round.... To conceal my condition from my audience I continually drink water, cough, often blow my nose as though I were hindered by a cold, make puns inappropriately, and in the end break off earlier than I ought to. But above all I am ashamed.\n\n\nMy conscience and my intelligence tell me that the very best thing I could do now would be to deliver a farewell lecture to the boys, to say my last word to them, to bless them, and give up my post to a man younger and stronger than me. But, God, be my judge, I have not manly courage enough to act according to my conscience.\n\nUnfortunately, I am not a philosopher and not a theologian. I know perfectly well that I cannot live more than another six months; it might be supposed that I ought now to be chiefly concerned with the question of the shadowy life beyond the grave, and the visions that will visit my slumbers in the tomb. But for some reason my soul refuses to recognize these questions, though my mind is fully alive to their importance. Just as twenty, thirty years ago, so now, on the threshold of death, I am interested in nothing but science. As I yield up my last breath I shall still believe that science is the most important, the most splendid, the most essential thing in the life of man; that it always has been and will be the highest manifestation of love, and that only by means of it will man conquer himself and nature. This faith is perhaps naive and may rest on false assumptions, but it is not my fault that I believe that and nothing else; I cannot overcome in myself this belief.\n\nBut that is not the point. I only ask people to be indulgent to my weakness, and to realize that to tear from the lecture-theatre and his pupils a man who is more interested in the history of the development of the bone medulla than in the final object of creation would be equivalent to taking him and nailing him up in his coffin without waiting for him to be dead.\n\nSleeplessness and the consequent strain of combating increasing weakness leads to something strange in me. In the middle of my lecture tears suddenly rise in my throat, my eyes begin to smart, and I feel a passionate, hysterical desire to stretch out my hands before me and break into loud lamentation. I want to cry out in a loud voice that I, a famous man, have been sentenced by fate to the death penalty, that within some six months another man will be in control here in the lecture-theatre. I want to shriek that I am poisoned; new ideas such as I have not known before have poisoned the last days of my life, and are still stinging my brain like mosquitoes. And at that moment my position seems to me so awful that I want all my listeners to be horrified, to leap up from their seats and to rush in panic terror, with desperate screams, to the exit.\nIt is not easy to get through such moments.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/5541941", "artist_names": "Watsky", "full_title": "COVID Relief Freestyle by\u00a0Watsky", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/15e329cac8808712e9bcdedd4c1b05fd.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/15e329cac8808712e9bcdedd4c1b05fd.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 5541941, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1384823, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1631089409, "path": "/Watsky-covid-relief-freestyle-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Watsky-covid-relief-freestyle-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2020, "month": 5, "day": 6}, "release_date_for_display": "May 6, 2020", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "May. 6, 2020", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/15e329cac8808712e9bcdedd4c1b05fd.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/15e329cac8808712e9bcdedd4c1b05fd.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 10559}, "title": "COVID Relief Freestyle", "title_with_featured": "COVID Relief Freestyle", "updated_by_human_at": 1631111404, "url": "https://genius.com/Watsky-covid-relief-freestyle-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/1720", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/68809fae4b7b39c02fa1c3a5b989b6be.851x315x1.jpg", "id": 1720, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/15e329cac8808712e9bcdedd4c1b05fd.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "w", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Watsky", "slug": "Watsky", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Watsky", "iq": 10534}, "artist": "Watsky", "lyrics": "COVID Relief Freestyle Lyrics[00:00:00]\nOh shit, I guess we're starting\nThe mic is where my heart is\nI know what my\u2005part\u2005is\nI hear my\u2005own voice\nI make my own choice\nI\u2005guess, we're fuckin' doing it\nThe horse is out the gates\nIt's\u205ftime\u205fto\u205fstart the race\nShoutout\u205fto Kathy Bates\u205fand also Betty White\nAll the people, if you're the type\nI wanna say that you're equal on the mic\nBut nobody's equal to me\nNobody is coming for my neck\nI am looking for respect\nI'm not looking for a check\nUnless it is for my friends\nThat's why we're doing this\nTo make some pennies\nAnd maybe make amends\nSailors in the sea might get the bends\nThat is my fuckin' dream\nTo go with James Cameron in a submarine\nTo the bottom of the ocean\nRocking forth with the motion\nMe and Jimmy Cameron, sipping on some potion\nSharing our emotion\nDaring you to fuck with us\nAt the sea, at a deep water vent\nBut we don't got the bends, we're not bent\nI think that's what I'm meant to do\nMe and my crew\nGigantic, looking to cross the sea\nFor the Titanic\nOh shit, you mean they found it?\nAlready?

know\nThrough the rain the sleet and the snow\nI'm bound to be out on that interstate\nHeaded on to the next toll-man's gate\n'Cause rambling is the rambler's state\nYour friends say that I'm

that I keep moving on\nDon't bother crying when you see I'm gone\nI'll breathe the air that my lungs once held\nBut I am hoping you'll do very well\nAnd now my love I'm saying;\nFare thee well\n\nYour

Brian Lynsky, the cub curser, was questioned at his shouting box, Bawlonabraggat, and gave a snappy comeback, when saying: Paw! Once more I\u2019ll hellbowl!

A wouldbe martyr, who is attending on sanit Asitas where he is being taught to wear bracelets, when grilled on the point, revealed the undoubted fact that the consequence would be that so long as Sankya Moondy played his mango tricks under the mysttetry, with shady apsaras sheltering in his leaves\u2019 licence and his shadowers torrifried by the potent bolts of indradiction, there would be fights all over Cuxhaven.

Missioner Ida Womb-well, the seventeenyearold revivalist, said concerning the coinci \u2014 dent of interfizzing with grenadines and other respectable and disgusted peersons using the park: That perpendicular person is a brut!

Sylvia Silence, the girl detective (Meminerva, but by now one hears turtlings all over Doveland!) when supplied with informations as to the several facets of the case in her cozy-dozy bachelure\u2019s flat, quite overlooking John a\u2019Dream\u2019s mews, leaned back in her really truly easy chair to query restfully through her vowelthreaded syllabelles: Have you evew thought, wepow-tew, that sheew gweatness was his twadgedy?

It was after the show at Wednesbury that one tall man, humping a suspicious parcel, when returning late amid a dense particular on his home way from the second house of the Boore and Burgess Christy Menestrels by the old spot, Roy\u2019s Corner, had a barkiss revolver placed to his faced with the words: you\u2019re shot, major: by an unknowable assailant (masked) against whom he had been jealous over, Lotta Crabtree or Pomona Evlyn. More than that Whenn the Waylayer (not a Lucalizod diocesan or even of the Glenda-lough see, but hailing fro\u2019 the prow of Little Britain), mention \u2014 ing in a bytheway that he, the crawsopper, had, in edition to Reade\u2019s cutless centiblade, a loaded Hobson\u2019s which left only twin alternatives as, viceversa, either he would surely shoot her, the aunt, by pistol, (she could be okaysure of that!) or, failing of such, bash in Patch\u2019s blank face beyond recognition, pointedly asked with gaeilish gall wodkar blizzard\u2019s business Thornton had with that Kane\u2019s fender only to be answered by the aggravated assaulted that that that was the snaps for him, Midweeks, to sultry well go and find out if he was showery well able.

This battering babel allower the door and sideposts, he always said, was not in the very remotest like the belzey babble of a bottle of boose which would not rouse him out o\u2019 slumber deep but reminded him loads more of the martiallawsey marses of foreign musi-kants\u2019 instrumongs or the overthrewer to the third last days of Pompery, if anything.

But old grum he\u2019s not so clean dippy between sweet you and yum (not on your life, boy! not in those trousers! not by a large jugful!) for someplace on the sly, where Furphy he isn\u2019t by, old grum has his gel number two (bravevow, our Grum!) and he would like to canoodle her too some part of the time for he is downright fond of his number one but O he\u2019s fair mashed on peaches number two so that if he could only canoodle the two, chivee chivoo, all three would feel genuinely happy, it\u2019s as simple as A. B. C., the two mixers, we mean, with their cherrybum chappy (for he is simply shamming dippy) if they all were afloat in a dreamlifeboat, hugging two by two in his zoo-doo-you-doo, a tofftoff for thee, missymissy for me and howcameyou-e\u2019enso for Farber, in his tippy, upindown dippy, tiptoptippy canoodle, can you? Finny.\n\nAck, ack, ack. With which clap, trap and soddenment, three to a loaf, our mutual friends the fender and the bottle at the gate seem to be implicitly in the same bateau, so to singen, bearing also several of the earmarks of design, for there is in fact no use in putting a tooth in a snipery of that sort and the amount of all those sort of things which has been going on onceaday in and twiceaday out every other nachtistag among all kinds of pro-miscious individuals at all ages in private homes and reeboos publikiss and allover all and elsewhere throughout secular sequence the country over and overabroad has been particularly stupendous. To be continued. Federals\u2019 Uniteds\u2019 Transports\u2019 Unions\u2019 for Exultations\u2019 of Triumphants\u2019 Ecstasies.\nBut resuming inquiries. Will it ever be next morning the postal unionist\u2019s (officially called carrier\u2019s, Letters Scotch, Limited) strange fate (Fierceendgiddyex he\u2019s hight, d.e., the losel that hucks around missivemaids\u2019 gummibacks) to hand in a huge chain envelope, written in seven divers stages of ink, from blanch-essance to lavandaiette, every pothook and pancrook bespaking the wisherwife, superscribed and subpencilled by yours A Laugh-able Party, with afterwite, S.A.G., to Hyde and Cheek, Eden \u2014 berry, Dubblenn, WC? Will whatever will be written in lappish language with inbursts of Maggyer always seem semposed, black looking white and white guarding black, in that siamixed twoa-talk used twist stern swift and jolly roger? Will it bright upon us, nightle, and we plunging to our plight? Well, it might now, mircle, so it light. Always and ever till Cox\u2019s wife, twice Mrs Hahn, pokes her beak into the matter with Owen K. after her, to see whawa smutter after, will this kiribis pouch filled with litterish frag-ments lurk dormant in the paunch of that halpbrother of a herm, a pillarbox?\n\nThe coffin, a triumph of the illusionist\u2019s art, at first blench naturally taken for a handharp (it is handwarp to tristinguish jubabe from jabule or either from tubote when all three have just been invened) had been removed from the hardware premises of Oetzmann and Nephew, a noted house of the gonemost west, which in the natural course of all things continues to supply funeral requisites of every needed description. Why needed, though? Indeed needed (wouldn\u2019t you feel like rattanfowl if you hadn\u2019t the oscar!) because the flash brides or bride in their lily boleros one games with at the Nivynubies\u2019 finery ball and your upright grooms that always come right up with you (and by jingo when they do!) what else in this mortal world, now ours, when meet there night, mid their nackt, me there na-ket, made their nought the hour strikes, would bring them right \u2014 came back in the flesh, thumbs down, to their orses and their hashes.\n\nTo proceed. We might leave that nitrience of oxagiants to take its free of the air and just analectralyse that very chymerical com-bination, the gasbag where the warderworks. And try to pour somour heiterscene up thealmostfere. In the bottled heliose case continuing, Long Lally Tobkids, the special, sporting a fine breast of medals, and a conscientious scripturereader to boot in the brick and tin choorch round the coroner, swore like a Norewheezian tailliur on the stand before the proper functionary that he was up against a right querrshnorrt of a mand in the butcher of the blues who, he guntinued, on last epening after delivering some car-casses mattonchepps and meatjutes on behalf of Messrs Otto Sands and Eastman, Limericked, Victuallers, went and, with his unmitigated astonissment, hickicked at the dun and dorass against all the runes and, when challenged about the pretended hick (it was kickup and down with him) on his solemn by the imputant imputed, said simply: I appop pie oath, Phillyps Captain. You did, as I sostressed before. You are deepknee in error, sir, Madam Tomkins, let me then tell you, replied with a gentlewomanly salaam MackPartland, (the meatman\u2019s family, and the oldest in the world except nick, name.) And Phelps was flayful with his peeler. But his phizz fell.\n\nNow to the obverse. From velveteens to dimities is barely a fivefinger span and hence these camelback excesses are thought to have been instigated by one or either of the causing causes of all, those rushy hollow heroines in their skirtsleeves, be she ma-gretta be she the posque. Oh! Oh! Because it is a horrible thing to have to say to say to day but one dilalah, Lupita Lorette, short-ly after in a fit of the unexpectednesses drank carbolic with all her dear placid life before her and paled off while the other soiled dove that\u2019s her sister-inlove, Luperca Latouche, finding one day while dodging chores that she stripped teasily for binocu-lar man and that her jambs were jimpjoyed to see each other, the nautchy girly soon found her fruitful hat too small for her and rapidly taking time, look, she rapidly took to necking, partying and selling her spare favours in the haymow or in lumber closets or in the greenawn ad huck (there are certain intimacies in all ladies\u2019 lavastories we just lease to imagination) or in the sweet churchyard close itself for a bit of soft coal or an array of thin trunks, serving whom in fine that same hot coney a la Zingara which our own little Graunya of the chilired cheeks dished up to the greatsire of Oscar, that son of a Coole. Houri of the coast of emerald, arrah of the lacessive poghue, Aslim-all-Muslim, the resigned to her surrender, did not she, come leinster\u2019s even, true dotter of a dearmud, (her pitch was Forty Steps and his perch old Cromwell\u2019s Quarters) with so valkirry a licence as sent many a poor pucker packing to perdition, again and again, ay, and again sfidare him, tease fido, eh tease fido, eh eh tease fido, toos top-ples topple, stop, dug of a dog of a dgiaour, ye! Angealousmei! And did not he, like Arcoforty, farfar off Bissavolo, missbrand her behaveyous with iridescent huecry of down right mean false sop lap sick dope? Tawfulsdreck! A reine of the shee, a shebeen quean, a queen of pranks. A kingly man, of royal mien, regally robed, exalted be his glory! So gave so take: Now not, not now! He would just a min. Suffering trumpet! He thought he want. Whath? Hear, O hear, living of the land! Hungreb, dead era, hark! He hea, eyes ravenous on her lippling lills. He hear her voi of day gon by. He hears! Zay, zay, zay! But, by the beer of his profit, he cannot answer. Upterputty till rise and shine! Nor needs none shaft ne stele from Phenicia or Little Asia to obelise on the spout, neither pobalclock neither folksstone, nor sunkenness in Tomar\u2019s Wood to bewray how erpressgangs score off the rued. The mouth that tells not will ever attract the unthinking tongue and so long as the obseen draws theirs which hear not so long till allearth\u2019s dumbnation shall the blind lead the deaf. Tatcho, tawney yeeklings! The column of lumps lends the pattrin of the leaves behind us. If violence to life, limb and chattels, often as not, has been the expression, direct or through an agent male, of womanhid offended, (ah! ah!), has not levy of black mail from the times the fairies were in it, and fain for wilde erthe blothoms followed an impressive private reputation for whispered sins?\n\nNow by memory inspired, turn wheel again to the whole of the wall. Where Gyant Blyant fronts Peannlueamoore There was once upon a wall and a hooghoog wall a was and such a wall-hole did exist. Ere ore or ire in Aaarlund. Or you Dair\u2019s Hair or you Diggin Mosses or your horde of orts and oriorts to garble a garthen of Odin and the lost paladays when all the eddams ended with aves. Armen? The doun is theirs and still to see for menags if he strikes a lousaforitch and we\u2019ll come to those baregazed shoeshines if you just shoodov a second. And let oggs be good old gaggles and Isther Estarr play Yesther Asterr. In the drema of Sorestost Areas, Diseased. A stonehinged gate then was for another thing while the suroptimist had bought and enlarged that shack under fair rental of one yearlyng sheep, (prime) value of sixpence, and one small yearlyng goat (cadet) value of eight-pence, to grow old and happy (hogg it and kidd him) for the re \u2014 minants of his years; and when everything was got up for the purpose he put an applegate on the place by no means as some pretext a bedstead in loo thereof to keep out donkeys (the pig-dirt hanging from the jags to this hour makes that clear) and just thenabouts the iron gape, by old custom left open to prevent the cats from getting at the gout, was triplepatlockt on him on purpose by his faithful poorters to keep him inside probably and possibly enaunter he felt like sticking out his chest too far and tempting gracious providence by a stroll on the peoplade\u2019s egg-day, unused as he was yet to being freely clodded.\n\nO, by the by, lets wee brag of praties, it ought to be always remembered in connection with what has gone before that there was a northroomer, Herr Betreffender, out for his zimmer hole-digs, digging in number 32 at the Rum and Puncheon (Branch of Dirty Dick\u2019s free house) in Laxlip (where the Sockeye Sammons were stopping at the time orange fasting) prior to that, a Kom-merzial (Gorbotipacco, he was wreaking like Zentral Oylrubber) from Osterich, the U.S.E. paying (Gaul save the mark!) II/\u2014 in the week (Gosh, these wholly romads!) of conscience money in the first deal of Yuly wheil he was, swishing beesnest with bles-sure, and swobbing broguen eeriesh myth brockendootsch, making his reporterage on Der Fall Adams for the Frankofurto Siding, a Fastland payrodicule, and er, consstated that one had on him the Lynn O\u2019Brien, a meltoned lammswolle, disturbed, and wider he might the same zurichschicken other he would, with tosend and obertosend tonnowatters, one monkey\u2019s damages become. Now you must know, franksman, to make a heart of glass, that the game of gaze and bandstand butchery was merely a Patsy O\u2019Strap tissue of threats and obuses such as roebucks raugh at pinnacle\u2019s peak and after this sort. Humphrey\u2019s unsolicited visitor, Davy or Titus, on a burgley\u2019s clan march from the middle west, a hikely excellent crude man about road who knew his Bullfoost Mountains like a starling bierd, after doing a long dance untidled to Cloudy Green, deposend his bockstump on the waityoumay-wantme, after having blew some quaker\u2019s (for you! Oates!) in through the houseking\u2019s keyhole to attract attention, bleated through the gale outside which the tairor of his clothes was hog-callering, first, be the hirsuiter, that he would break his bulshey \u2014 wigger\u2019s head for him, next, be the heeltapper, that he would break the gage over his lankyduckling head the same way he would crack a nut with a monkeywrench and, last of all, be the stirabouter, that he would give him his (or theumperom\u2019s or any-bloody else\u2019s) thickerthanwater to drink and his bleday steppe \u2014 brodhar\u2019s into the bucket. He demanded more wood alcohol to pitch in with, alleging that his granfather\u2019s was all taxis and that it was only after ten o\u2019connell, and this his isbar was a public oven for the sake of irsk irskusky, and then, not easily dis-couraged, opened the wrathfloods of his atillarery and went on at a wicked rate, weathering against him in mooxed metaphores from eleven thirty to two in the afternoon without even a lunch-eonette interval for House, son of Clod, to come out, you jew \u2014 beggar, to be Executed Amen.

The boys hare off just ahead of them. They take a turn down a back alley way and the crowds of screaming girls are after them.\n\n2.\tEXT. TERMINAL\n\nThey rush on through the narrow cobbled passageway and into the main station, quickly show their tickets at the barrier for the London train, and get onto the platform as hordes of yelling and screaming girls reach the closed gates.\n\n3.\tEXT. TERMINAL PLATFORM\n\nWe see the fans rushing to the few platform ticket machines, and endless pennies being dropped and tickets torn out in their haste to get onto the platform to see the boys.\nNORM has been waiting for the boys and he hurries them to where all their baggage, instruments and the drums are waiting, piled up to be put into the guards' van. The boys turn and see the oncoming stream of girls pushing through the barriers and descending on them with yells and shouts. They grab their instruments, RINGO makes for the drums. NORM plugs into a handy transformer and using their instruments like a gun volley to stop the onrush of females, the boys blast fire into a number and start to sing. This stops the girls in their tracks and they settle down on whatever they can to listen to them playing.\n\nAs the boys are playing, we CUT BACK into the crowds. In the centre we see PAUL struggling and pulling to fight his way through the girls to join the other boys. He is dragging a very reluctant old man behind him. The old man seems most disgruntled and we can see by his gestures how unwilling he is to be pulled and pushed forward through all the girls.\n\nAt last PAUL reaches the other boys. He sits the old man down on a pile of cases and joins in the number to the squeals of delight from the fans. The old man sits aloof and proud ignoring the whole proceedings. JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO look enquiringly at PAUL who gives a noncommittal shrug of the shoulders as if to say, \"it's not my fault\" and the number proceeds.\n\nSHOT of sudden horror on JOHN's face. PAUL follows his eye line only to see the old man has doffed his cap and is busily collecting money from a disconcerted crowd. PAUL dives hastily into the crowd, and with suitable apologies extracts the old man and with a long suffering sigh drags him back to the group. GEORGE and PAUL hold him firmly as they finish the number, the old man standing there between them.\n\nAs the number finishes and the girls scream and shout with delight, the guard blows his whistle. NORM and SHAKE grab the instruments and the drums, and with the rest piles the lot into the guards' van. The BOYS head into their reserved compartment pursued by the fans but the train moves off. They have successfully repelled all extra boarders.\n\nTHE BOYS stand and wave to the fans until out of sight line ... the girls running along to the end of the platform waving and calling out.\n\n4.\tINTERIOR  RESERVED COMPARTMENT IN THE TRAIN\n\nThe boys relax, sitting down on one side of the compartment. They are about to settle down and make themselves at home when first RINGO nudges GEORGE who in turn nudges JOHN. Opposite them is sitting the LITTLE OLD MAN. He is holding himself stiff, erect and very aloof.\n\nThe three boys look at him enquiringly but with an elaborate sniff he looks away from them and out of the window.\n\nPAUL catches his eye and winks at the LITTLE OLD MAN. He winks back at PAUL, scowls at the other three then looks firmly out of the window again.\n\nThe boys turn on PAUL crowding around him.\n\nJOHN\nEh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?\n\nPAUL\nWhat little old man?\nJOHN\n(pointing)\nThat little old man.\n\nPAUL\nOh, that one. That's me Grandfather.\n\nGEORGE\nThat's not your Grandfather.\n\nPAUL\nIt is, y'know.\n\nGEORGE\nBut your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.\n\nPAUL\nOh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.\n\nJOHN\nHow d'you reckon that one out?\n\nPAUL\nWell ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.\n\nJOHN\n(long suffering)\nWell we know that but what's he doing here?\nPAUL\nWell, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.\n\nRINGO\nHow's that?\n\nPAUL\nOh ... he's nursing a broken heart.\n\nThe lads all look intently at the GRANDFATHER.\n\nJOHN\nAah ... the poor old thing.\n\nHe leans across to GRANDFATHER.\n\nJOHN\nEh, Mister... are you nursing a broken heart then?\n\nThe GRANDFATHER nods soulfully glares at him, in a way that indicates yes.\n\nPAUL\n(whispering)\nYou see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.\n\nGEORGE\nA butcher?\n\nPAUL\nYeah, she was fickle.\n\nJOHN\nAye and fond of fresh meat and all.\n\nPAUL\n(seriously)\nNo ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.\n\nJOHN\nOh, I see.\n\nHe inspects GRANDFATHER carefully.\n\nJOHN\n(to PAUL)\nEh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?\n\nPAUL\nOh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.\n\nThey all agree with PAUL.\n\nJOHN has been examining GRANDFATHER. He now leans forward to him.\n\nJOHN\n(in an over-friendly voice)\nHello, Grandfather!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHello.\n\nJOHN\n(delightedly)\nHe can talk then?\n\nPAUL\n(indignantly)\nCourse he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?\n\nRINGO\n(grinning)\nWell ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?\n\nThe lads all laugh.\n\nJOHN\nAnd we're looking after him, are we?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI'll look after meself.\n\nPAUL\nAye, that's what I'm afraid of!\n\nJOHN\nHe's got you worried, then?\n\nPAUL\nHim, he costs you a fortune in breach-of-promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.\n\nGEORGE\n(disbelieving)\nGerron.\n\nPAUL\nNo, straight up.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThe lad's given you the simple truth. I'm cursed wid irresistible charm, I'm too attractive to be let loose.\n\nAt this moment, SHAKE, a tall man who works with the BOYS, pulls open the door of the compartment.\n\nSHAKE\nYou got on all right then?\n\nBOYS\nHi, Shake.\n\nSHAKE\nWe're here. Norm'll be along in a mo' with the tickets.\n\nHe sees GRANDFATHER.\n\nSHAKE\nMorning!\n(whispers)\nWho's that little old man?\n\nGEORGE\nIt's Paul's grandfather.\n\nSHAKE\nOh aye, but I thought ...\n\nJOHN\n(cutting in)\nNo, that's his other one.\n\nSHAKE\nThat's all right then.\n\nJOHN\n(displaying Grandfather)\nClean though, isn't he?\n\nSHAKE\nOh yes, he's clean all right.\n\nNORM the road manager appears behind SHAKE.\n\nNORM\nMorning, lads.\n\nBOYS\nMorning ... Hi, Norm.\n\nNORM\n(checking them quickly)\nWell, thank God you're all got here. Now, listen, I've had this marvellous idea ... now just for a change, let's all behave like ordinary responsible citizens. Let's not cause any trouble, pull any strokes or do anything I'm going to be sorry for, especially tomorrow at the television theatre, because ...\n\nHe looks sharply at JOHN who is polishing his nails.\n\nNORM\nAre you listening to me, Lennon?\n\nJOHN\n(off-hand)\nYou're a swine, isn't he George?\n\nGEORGE\n(disinterested)\nYeah ... a swine.\n\nNORM\n(just as indifferent)\nThanks...\n\nHe sees the GRANDFATHER.\n\nNORM\nEh ... .\n\nBOYS IN CHORUS\n... Who's that little old man?\n\nNORM\nWell, who is he?\n\nRINGO\nHe belongs to Paul.\n\nNORM\n(accepting the situation)\nAh well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?\n\nPAUL\nWe'll follow you down.\n\nGRANDFATHER rises.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI want me coffee.\n\nNORM\nHe can come with Shake and me if you like.\n\nPAUL\nWell, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.\n\nNORM\nDon't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.\n\nGRANDFATHER joins SHAKE and NORM.\n\nNORM\n(over Grandfather's head)\nHe's very clean, isn't he?\n\nSHAKE and NORM collect GRANDFATHER and are in the process of leaving the compartment when a fat upper class city Englishman, JOHNSON, attempts to enter. There is a bit of confusion and they get tangled up with each other.\n\nJOHNSON\nMake up your minds, will you!\n\nAt last SHAKE, NORM and GRANDFATHER sort themselves out and JOHNSON enters with his case. The other three go to coffee.\n\nJOHNSON puts his case up on the luggage rack, then sits down. All his movements are disgruntled ... he finally picks up his copy of the Financial Times and burying himself behind it, starts to read. After a moment he looks up, notices the compartment window is open. He gets up and without so much as a \"by your leave\" he closes it, glares at the BOYS and sits down again.\n\nThe boys exchange looks as if to say ... \"Hello, Saucy!!\"\n\nPAUL\n(politely)\nDo you mind if we have it opened?\n\nJOHNSON\n(briefly)\nYes, I do.\n\nJOHN\nYeah, but there are four of us, like, and we'd like it open, if it's all the same to you, that is.\n\nJOHNSON\n(rudely)\nWell, it isn't. I travel on this train regularly twice a week, so I suppose I've some rights.\n\nRINGO\nAye, well, so have we.\n\nHe disappears behind his paper before the BOYS can say another word.\n\nRINGO pulls a face at the raised paper and switches on his portable radio. A pop number is playing.\n\nJOHNSON puts down his paper firmly.\n\nJOHNSON\nAnd we'll have that thing off as well, thank you.\n\nRINGO\nBut I ...\n\nJOHNSON leans over and switches it off.\n\nJOHNSON\nAn elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts would tell you I'm perfectly within my rights.\n\nHe smiles frostily.\n\nPAUL\nYeah, but we want to hear it and there's more of us than you. We're a community, like, a majority vote. Up the workers and all that stuff!\n\nJOHNSON\nThen I suggest you take that damned thing into the corridor or some other part of the train where you obviously belong.\n\nJOHN\n(leaning forward to him)\nGie's a kiss!\n\nPAUL\nShurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.\n\nJOHNSON\nI travel on this train regularly, twice a week.\n\nJOHN\nKnock it off, Paul, y' can't win with his sort. After all, it's his train, isn't it, Mister?\n\nJOHNSON\nAnd don't you take that tone with me, young man!\n\nGEORGE\nBut...\n\nJOHNSON\n(accusingly)\nI fought the war for your sort.\n\nRINGO\nBet you're sorry you won!\n\nJOHNSON\nI'll call the guard!\n\nPAUL\nAye ... but what? They don't take kindly to insults you know. Ah, come on, you lot. Let's get a cup of coffee and leave Toby the manger.\n\nThe boys troop out of the door into the corridor. JOHNSON smiles triumphantly. He is about to settle down to his paper when there is a tap on the corridor window. He looks up and we see pressed against the window a collection of hideous Beatle faces.\n\nPAUL\nEh, Mister ... can we have our ball back!\n\nThe man jumps to his feet.\n\n\n5.\tINTERIOR  OF THE CORRIDOR\n\nThe boys run away like a pack of school boys and disappear round the corner.\n\n\n6.\tINTERIOR OF THE TRAIN CORRIDOR\n\nFrom the P.O.V. of the door leading to the restaurant car.\n\nThe boys come down the corridor in full flight, laughing away like happy idiots. GEORGE and PAUL pull open the sliding doors. The boys look inside.\n\n7.\tINTERIOR  RESTAURANT CAR\n\nFrom their P.O.V. we see the car is half empty and at a table in the centre SHAKE and NORM and GRANDFATHER are sitting. On the table is a pile of photos of the boys. NORM and SHAKE are arguing. NORM is being very aggressive, much to SHAKE's discomfort.\n\nNORM\nYeah, you want to watch it.\n\nSHAKE\n(unhappily)\nIt's not my fault.\n\nNORM\nWell, you stick to that story, son.\n\nSHAKE\nI can't help it, I'm just taller than you.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(To NORM slyly)\nThey always say that.\n\nNORM\nYeah, well I got me eye on you.\n\nSHAKE\nI'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller\nthan you.\n\nNORM\nWell, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ...\n(he is about to thump SHAKE.)\n\nJOHN\n(enjoying himself)\nIf you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.\n\nNORM\nHe started it.\n\nSHAKE\nNo, I didn't you did ...\n\nGEORGE\nWell, what happened?\n\nSHAKE\nThe old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'\n\nPAUL\nAnd?\n\nNORM\nYour Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.\n\nPAUL\nI knew it, he started it, I should have known.\n\nNORM\nY'what?\n\nPAUL\nYou two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.\n\nThe BOYS, i.e., JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO, look at each other then at PAUL.\n\nPAUL\nAye and we'll have to watch it and all.\n\nGEORGE\nI suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.\n\nNORM\nYou're right. Here you are, old devil.\n\nSHAKE and NORM leave. GRANDFATHER grins triumphantly and collects them, then with a sweet smile he turns to PAUL.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWould you ever sign this one for us, Pauly?\n\nPAUL does so automatically but in the middle of signing he gets suspicious. GRANDFATHER smiles at him charmingly so PAUL finishes signing.\n\nJOHN\nCome on let's get this coffee.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nBefore you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!\n\nJOHN, RINGO and GEORGE take this up straight away. They all pretend to be girls, RINGO jumps into PAUL's arms.\n\nGEORGE\n(coyly)\nOh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!\n\nJOHN\n(invitingly, in a Marlene Dietrich voice)\nIf I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?\n\nPAUL\n(choked)\nI'll murder you, Grandfather!\n\nJOHN waltzes PAUL down to an empty table and the lads sit down.\n\nGEORGE\nEh, look at that talent.\n\nThey all gaze across the aisle. From their P.O.V. we see two very attractive young girls, RITA and JEAN, having coffee.\n\nJOHN\nGive 'em a pull.\n\nPAUL\nShall I?\n\nGEORGE\nAye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.\n\nPAUL\nNow what's that supposed to mean?\n\nGEORGE\n(grinning)\nI don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?\n\nJOHN\nGeorge Harrison, The Scouse of Distinction.\n\nWe follow PAUL as he crosses over to the two girls. He places a bowler on his head.\n\nPAUL\n(in posh accent)\nExcuse me, but these young men I'm sitting with wondered if two of us could join you; I'd ask you meself only I'm shy.\n\nThe two girls giggle together.\n\nJOHN and GEORGE are about to move over when GRANDFATHER suddenly appears by their sides.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(sternly)\nI'm sorry, miss, but you mustn't fraternise with my prisoners.\n\nJEAN\nPrisoners!!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nConvicts in transit to Wormwood Scrubs. Typical old lags, the lot of 'em.\n\nTHE BOYS\nY'what!!!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nQuiet, you lot, or I'll give you a touch of me truncheon.\n(He points at Ringo)\nThat little one's the worst. If we don't keep him on tablets he has fits.\n\nRINGO\n(protesting)\nNow look here!!\n\nGRANDFATHER grabs two lumps of sugar from the table and forces them into RINGO'S mouth.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nGet out while you can, ladies, his time's\ncoming round for one of his turns.\n\nThe frightened girls scurry out of the restaurant car. The boys look in amazement and horror at GRANDFATHER. They are completely flabbergasted. GRANDFATHER smiles at them benignly.\n\n\n8.\tINTERIOR OF RAILWAY COMPARTMENT\n\nSHAKE and NORM are seated. SHAKE is buried in a science fiction book.\n\nNORM looks at his watch, slightly worried.\n\nNORM\nHe's been gone a long time.\n\nSHAKE\n(without looking up)\nWho?\n\nNORM\nPaul's grandfather.\n\nSHAKE\nOh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?\n\nNORM\nDown the ... er ...\n\nSHAKE\nOh, down the ... er ...?\n\nNORM\nYeah, down the ... er ...\n\nSHAKE\nWell, give a couple of minutes ...\n\nHe resumes reading. But NORM goes on worrying.\n\n9.\tINTERIOR OF ANOTHER RAILWAY COMPARTMENT\n\nGrandfather is in full flight of conversation with a charming elderly lady, AUDREY, who is listening intently.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(proudly)\nYes, I'm their manager, I discovered them.\n\nLADY AUDREY\nDid you indeed, Mr. McCartney?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nNow, Audrey, I told you, the name's John. We show biz people are a friendly lot.\n\nAUDREY\nOf course, John.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. \"Mister, can you spare us a copper?\" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.\n\nAUDREY\nThe usual ten per cent?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nOh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?\n\nAUDREY\n(her eyes lighting up)\nHow fascinating. Do go on ...\n(pause)\n... John.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...\n\n10.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN\n\nNORM and SHAKE meet with the BOYS as they are returning from coffee.\n\nNORM\nEh, have you got Paul's grandfather?\n\nJOHN\nOf course, he's concealed about me person.\n\nNORM\nNo ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.\n\nPAUL\n(accusingly)\nHave you lost him?\n\nNORM\nDon't exaggerate.\n\nPAUL\nYou've lost him.\n\nSHAKE\nPut it this way, he's mislaid him.\n\nPAUL\nYou can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.\n\nSHAKE\nHe can't be far.\n\nJOHN\nI hope he fell off.\n\nPAUL\n(mildly)\nDon't be callous.\n\nRINGO\nHe doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.\n\nGEORGE\nYou've got an inferiority complex, you have.\n\nRINGO\nYeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.\n\nJOHN and PAUL run down the corridor. SHAKE and NORM turn from the door and go in the opposite direction, GEORGE and RINGO follow after the other two boys.\n\n11.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR OF TRAIN\n\nPAUL and JOHN look into various compartments. CLOSE SHOT of RINGO looking into compartments in the manner of Groucho Marx. In one of the compartments we see from RINGO'S P.O.V. the occupant, a glamorous woman, TANIA, with a small lap dog.\n\nShe is beautifully and most expensively dressed. She looks up and sees RINGO.\n\nRINGO smiles at her and she smiles back. She then beckons him to join her.\n\nHe looks around to see if she means someone else. She nods a negative. RINGO looks back enquiringly then points at himself as if to say: \"Who, me?\"\n\nTANIA smiles enthusiastically.\n\nGEORGE has been watching all this.\n\nGEORGE\nAre you going in?\n\nRINGO\nNo, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.\n\nGEORGE\nYou never know, you might be lucky this time.\n\nRINGO\nNo, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.\n\nHe blows the glamorous lady a kiss, then moves sadly on.\n\n12.\tINTERIOR  FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR\n\nPAUL enters a compartment followed by JOHN. The TWO GIRLS, RITA and JEAN, from the restaurant car are sitting there.\n\nPAUL\nExcuse me but have you seen that little old man we were with?\n\nThe girls jump up, surprised.\n\nJOHN\nWe've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!\n(he extends his hands as if handcuffed)\nEh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.\n\nPAUL\nWill you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...\n\nHe starts to drag JOHN after him.\n\nJOHN\nI was innocent. I was framed. I won't go back.\n\nJOHN is now by the door; he leers at the girls horribly.\n\nJOHN\nI bet you can guess what I was in for.\n\nHe cackles like a maniac before disappearing, the door closing after him.\n\nA waiter carrying a tray with champagne and glasses on it passes into one of the compartments with the blinds down.\n\nPAUL\nHow about that one?\n\nHe moves towards the compartment.\n\nPAUL\n(to Ringo and George)\nDid you look in here?\n\nGEORGE\nNo. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.\n\nPAUL\nWell, let's broaden our outlook.\n\nPAUL opens the door of the compartment.\n\n13.\tINTERIOR OF COMPARTMENT\n\nFrom the BOYS' P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER and the elderly lady, AUDREY, sipping champagne and nibbling caviar on toast.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(looking up)\nCongratulate me, boys, I'm engaged.\n\nPAUL enters and crosses over to him.\n\nPAUL\nOh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nIt's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.\n\nPAUL\nOh, well that's all right.\n(realising)\nWhat?\n\nAUDREY\nYoung man, kindly moderate your tone when you address my fiance.\n\nPAUL\nI'm sorry, Missus, but the betrothal's off.\n(He grabs GRANDFATHER by the arm.)\nI'll refuse me consent, he's over-age!\n\nAUDREY grabs GRANDFATHER's other arm and pulls back.\n\nAUDREY\nLeave him alone, after all he's done for you is this the way you repay him?\n\nA tug of war now starts between PAUL and AUDREY.\n\nPAUL\n(pulling)\nHim? he's never done anything for anybody in his life.\n\nAUDREY\n(pulling)\nYou dare to say that when even those ridiculous clothes you are wearing were bought when you forced him to sell out his gilt edged Indomitables!!\n\nJOHN and GEORGE jump on the seat egging PAUL and AUDREY on.\n\nJOHN\nCome on, Auntie, you're winning.\n\nGEORGE\nGet in there, Paul, she's weakening.\n\nRINGO attempts to interfere.\n\nRINGO\nLook, Missus, this is all a misunderstanding, you see, he's ...\n\nAUDREY\nKeep away from me, you depraved lout, I know all about your terrible past.\n\nRINGO\nY'what?\n\nShe hits RINGO with her handbag and continues struggling with PAUL for GRANDFATHER. RINGO grabs her handbag to stop her hitting him.\n\nRINGO\nHe's given me a bad character, blackguarding me name to all and sundry. He's got to be stopped. It's not fair.\n\nRINGO pushes out into the corridor, forgetting that he is holding the woman's handbag.\n\nA voice shouts off from outside.\n\nVOICE OFF\nThat's one of them ... stop thief!\n\n14.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR\n\nFrom Ringo's P.O.V. we see down to the right the city man, JOHNSON, approaching with a GUARD. RINGO turns the other way to the left when he is joined by [the] three other boys. From their P.O.V. down the corridor we see the two girls, autograph books in hand, followed by ten girls from the same school.\n\nBoth groups are closing in on the BOYS. There's no escape.\n\nRINGO\n(looking down at the handbag in his hand)\nOh Mother!!\n\n15.\tINTERIOR  LUGGAGE VAN\n\nVery dark, and behind bars we see GRANDFATHER. He is sitting crouched up on a wooden box tea chest and looks pretty miserable. He turns towards the CAMERA; in the foreground of the SHOT we see PAUL standing.\nIn the background an impassive GUARD is reading a paper which he does throughout the scene.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(bitterly)\nAnd to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!\n\nPAUL\nDon't dramatise.\n\nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see GRANDFATHER in the luggage compartment of the guards' van. In with him are a crate of chickens and a dog. The chickens peck at him; GRANDFATHER moves listlessly away.\n\nPAUL\nLet's face it, you're lucky to be here. If they'd have had their way you'd have been dropped off at Stafford already.\n\nGRANDFATHER proudly turns away from PAUL who dodges round so he can still see his face.\n\nPAUL\nWell, you've got to admit you've upset a lot of people. At least I can keep my eye on you while you're stuck in here.\n\nGRANDFATHER turns away again.\n\nPAUL\nAll right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...\n\nGRANDFATHER\nA harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.\n\nPAUL\nOh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(cutting in)\nYou're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?\n\nPAUL\nYeah ... so what?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWhy do you always use your left hand?\n\nPAUL\nWell, don't be daft, I've got to.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.\n\nPAUL grins. After a moment of looking at him, PAUL opens the door of\nthe luggage compartment and joins GRANDFATHER on a box.\n\nPAUL\nShove up!\n\nGRANDFATHER produces a penny.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nOdds or evens?\n\nPAUL sighs.\n\nPAUL\nOdds.\n\nGRANDFATHER flips the coin.\n\nThe guards' van door opens and JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO come in, with them are the girls, RITA and JEAN.\n\nJOHN\n(as he sees PAUL behind the bars)\nDon't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.\n\nPAUL\nOh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.\n(to Ringo)\nAnyroad up ... It's all your fault.\n\nRINGO\nMe? Why?\n\nGEORGE\nBag-snatcher.\nGRANDFATHER\nThat's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.\n\nJOHN\n(casually)\nEvery morning.\n\nJOHN has been looking around the guards' van.\n\nJOHN\nGaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...\n(he pats the dog)\n'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.\n(he shudders)\nCome on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.\n\nPAUL\nLike what?\n\nJOHN\nWell, I've got me gob stopper.\n(he produces his mouth organ.)\nLook, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.\n\nAnd to RINGO's beat on a tea chest they are off, PAUL and GEORGE improvising other sounds, much to the GIRLS' delight. During the number, GRANDFATHER quietly lets the latch off the chicken crate and chickens begin to wander through the scene.\n\n16.\tEXTERIOR  TRAIN IN MOTION FROM ABOVE (NIGHT)\n\nWhile the number is progressing, the train is getting nearer and nearer to London.\n\n17.\tEXTERIOR  PLATFORM TERMINUS (NIGHT)\n\nSHOTS of the station full of GIRLS waiting for the BOYS.\n\n18.\tINTERIOR  GUARDS VAN\n\nBy the time the number finishes the train pulls up with a sharp halt that sends them all sprawling, BOYS and GIRLS.\n\nNORM enters the guards' van.\n\nNORM\nDon't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.\n\nJOHN\nPlease, can I have one to surge with?\n\nNORM\nNo.\n\nJOHN\nAh, go on, you swine.\n\nNORM\nNo, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.\n\nHe points and we see a big car parked across the road.\n\nThe BOYS prepare to depart, lining up with GRANDFATHER at the door.\n\n19.\tEXTERIOR  PLATFORM TERMINUS\n\nJust as they are ready to go, a line of taxis draws up parallel to the train and now separates them from the big car waiting for them.\n\nNORM\nOh no!\n\nGRANDFATHER pushes past the BOYS, holding his coat closed.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAll right, lads, follow me.\n\nAnd before NORM can stop him, he darts out of the door, PAUL after him. The fans further down the platform see PAUL and charge forward ... in a panic NORM and the others follow, JOHN just having time to kiss both the girls.\n\nJOHN\nVive l'amour!\n\nNORM drags him away.\n\n20.\tEXTERIOR  RAILWAY STATION\n\nThe BOYS manage to follow GRANDFATHER by leaping onto a motorized luggage carrier, GEORGE driving and the other three posing as a frozen tableau on the back. GRANDFATHER has arrived at a taxi door. He flings it open and runs through, opening the other door, thus making a safe bridge to the car.\n\nThe BOYS follow and manage to make it to the big car safely. They run towards grandfather's taxi. The FANS have followed the BOYS and we see streams of GIRLS piling through all the taxis one of which contains JOHNSON the city man, opening and shutting the doors to get through, much to the indignation of the TAXI DRIVERS.\n21.\tINTERIOR  BIG CAR\n\nNORM is sitting in front with the driver, FRANK. The four BOYS and GRANDFATHER are squashed together in the back.\n\nNORM\n(to the driver)\nGo like the clappers, son!\n\nFRANK\n(smoothly)\nThat was my entire intention, sir.\n\n22.\tEXTERIOR  STATION\n\nThe car moves off surrounded by the FANS; from a height we see them converge on the car but it moves forcefully out of the station and off.\n\nIt moves into the traffic in the main road and the journey to the hotel begins.\n\n23.\tINTERIOR  HOTEL SUITE  NIGHT\n\nThere is a reception room and off it lead rooms that are presumably bedrooms, bathroom, etc. JOHN is lying sprawled out on a settee listening to a transistor radio, demolishing a basket of fruit. PAUL is sitting at an upright piano and GRANDFATHER is mooching about the room. One of the doors opens and GEORGE enters followed by RINGO, none of the BOYS are wearing coats.\n\nRINGO\nI don't snore.\n\nGEORGE\nYou do - repeatedly.\n\nRINGO\n(to John)\nDo I snore?\n\nJOHN\n(eating a banana)\nYou're a window rattler, son.\n\nRINGO\nWell, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?\n\nPAUL\n(stopping playing)\nWith a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nDon't mock the afflicted, Pauly.\n\nPAUL\nOh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWell, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.\n\nNORM enters with three piles of fan mail and places them in front of JOHN on a table. RINGO is almost in tears, examining his nose in a mirror.\n\nNORM\nPaul, John, George - get at it.\n\nJOHN\nHello the income tax have caught up with us at last.\n\nPAUL and GEORGE gather round the low table. RINGO is left out of it.\n\nRINGO\nNone for me, then?\n\nNORM\nSorry.\n\nJohn hands RINGO a single envelope.\n\nJOHN\nThat'll keep you busy.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nIt's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...\n\nRINGO\nYou go and pick on your own.\n\nSHAKE enters with a stack of mail about three times larger than all the others put together.\n\nJOHN\nIs that yours?\n\nSHAKE\nFor Ringo.\n\nHe dumps it in Ringo's arms who staggers into an armchair. The BOYS send him up.\n\nJOHN\nThat must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.\n\nGEORGE\nHe comes from a large family.\n\nRINGO\n(dumping the letters)\nWell.\n\nRINGO opens his letter and reads it. It contains a large embossed card.\n\nRINGO\nEh, what's Boyd's Club?\n\nThe lads gather round him and PAUL takes the card from him and reads.\n\nPAUL\n\"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr Richard Starkey\"--that's you--\"in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet.\" Blimey!\n\nRINGO\n(surprised)\nAnd they want me?\n\nJOHN\nOh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.\n\nNORM\n(snatching the card)\nWell you're not going.\n\nRINGO\nAh.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(taking card from Norm)\nQuite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!\n\nHe pockets the card himself.\n\nRINGO\nThat's mine.\n\nNORM\nHave done, and you lot get your pens out.\n\nBOYS\nWhy?\n\nNORM\nIt's homework time for all you college puddings. I want this lot\n(he indicates the fan letters)\nall answered tonight.\n\nThe BOYS all protest.\n\nNORM\nI'll brook no denial!\n\nJOHN\nIt's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.\n\nNORM\nCome on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their\npenmanship.\n\nHe goes followed by SHAKE.\n\nThere is a pause and JOHN deliberately rises slowly and crosses to his coat. He puts it on and walks to the door.\n\nJOHN\nWhile the swine's away the piglets can play. Well, come on, what are we waiting for?\n\nWith a whoop PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO collect their coats and head for the door.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWhat about all these letters?\n\nBOYS\nRead 'em!\n\nThey disappear. After a moment GRANDFATHER takes out Ringo's card.\n\nC.U. GRANDFATHER\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd a free champagne buffet.\n\nHe grins to himself. At this moment a WAITER enters with a tray. He is clad in tails and GRANDFATHER eyes them longingly, measuring himself the while alongside the startled waiter. He leaves us with no doubt in our minds what he wants, i.e., the waiter's suit.\n\n\n24.\tINTERIOR  DANCING CLUB  NIGHT\n\nThe club is the latest in modern decor and full of teenagers all enjoying themselves. The CAMERA wanders around the club till it finally picks out JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO all crowded around one small table. The music is blaring away from a juke box and the BOYS join the dancers. They are recognised and given smiles and nods of encouragement\nby all the other customers. During this scene we\n\nCUT AWAY\n\n25.\tINTERIOR  BOYD'S CLUB  NIGHT\n\nThe whole atmosphere is of quiet elegance and loud wealth. Around the baccarat table the rich, bored customers sit barely moving a face muscle as they languidly murmur \"suivez\" and \"banco\" to the dealer as he operates the shoe. The manager of the club is beaming with satisfaction as he surveys his customers. One of these customers is clad in evening dress and he has his back to us. The rest of the players (male) are in suits. By each of them is standing a lush lady with a bored sophisticated face that looks as if it has been painted on. From the REVERSE of the LAST SHOT we now see the solitary evening dress player is GRANDFATHER. He looks around him and wipes off his look of enjoyment and elaborately out-bores everyone in the room.\n\nDEALER\nAlors, M'sieur?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(nonchalant)\nSoufl\u00e9e.\n\nHe turns to the buxom BLONDE, who is dripping over him.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI bet you're a great swimmer. My turn? Bingo!\n\nCROUPIER\nPas \"Bingo,\" M'sieur... Banco.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(taking)\nI'll take the little darlings anyway.\n\nHe takes up the cards and can't understand that they are unnumbered.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nTwo and one is three, carry one is four.\n\nThe buxom BLONDE leans over him.\n\nBLONDE\nLay them down.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(disturbed by his eyeline)\nEh?\n\nBLONDE\nLay them down.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWe'd be thrown out.\n\nBLONDE\nYour cards... lay them down... face up.\n\nHe does so.\n\nCROUPIER\nHuit \u00e0 la pointe... et sept.\n(He pushes chips and box to Grandfather.)\n\nBLONDE\nYou had a lovely little pair, y'see.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI did?\n\nCROUPIER taps impatiently on box (shoe).\n\nBLONDE\nThey're yours.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThey are?\n\nBLONDE\nThe cards... you're bank.\n\n26.\tINTERIOR  DANCING CLUB\n\nThe BOYS are having a rare old time and the place is really moving.\n\n27.\tINTERIOR  BOYD'S CLUB\n\nGRANDFATHER is playing and a waiter is checking the requirements of the players.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nBingo!\n\nCROUPIER\n(wearily)\nM'lord dit \"Bingo.\"\n\nWAITER\n(to Grandfather)\nA little light refreshment.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(lordly)\nA glass of the old chablis to wash down a gesture of giblets wouldn't go amiss.\n(He resumes his game.)\nSoufl\u00e9e, chop chop.\n\nThe CROUPIER uses the spatula to pick up a card. GRANDFATHER grabs it and scoops some sandwiches off a passing tray.\n28.\tINTERIOR  DANCING CLUB\n\nThe BOYS are at their table again laughing and enjoying themselves, when suddenly their faces freeze.\n\nFrom their P.O.V. we see NORM standing glowering down at them. With him is SHAKE. Reluctantly the BOYS arise and follow NORM out.\n\n29.\tINTERIOR  BOYD'S\n\nGRANDFATHER is looking worried at the call of the card he loses and we see that all his chips have gone. He notices the waiter delivering snacks and champagne to a couple, so quick as a flash, he places a handkerchief over his arm and writing a bill out on a piece of paper, presents it to the couple and collects payment in chips. He then resumes playing.\n\n30.\tINTERIOR  HOTEL ROOM\n\nWaiter is sitting on chair in underclothes, reading. He hears a noise, says \"The manager!\" and hides in outer clothes closet. NORM and the BOYS enter saying:\n\nNORM\nNow get on with it.\n\nJOHN\nWe were going to do it.\n\nNORM\nAye, well, now!\n(He goes through bedroom.)\n\nRINGO goes to hang up coat in closet. He does so, then crosses to rest.\n\nRINGO\nAny of you lot put a man in that cupboard?\n\nALL\nA man? No.\n\nRINGO\nWell somebody did.\n\nGEORGE goes to cupboard. We see the WAITER from his P.O.V. He closes door, returns to group.\n\nGEORGE\nHe's right, y'know.\n\nBOYS\n(disinterested)\nAh well, there you go.\n\nSHAKE enters front door, goes to hang up coat and drags WAITER out.\n\nSHAKE\nEh, what's all this?\n\nPAUL\nOh, him... He's been lurking.\n\nJOHN\nAye, he looks a right lurker.\n\nSHAKE\n(to WAITER)\nYou're undressed. Where are your clothes?\n\nWAITER\nThe old gentlemen borrowed them to go gambling at Boyd's.\n\nPAUL\nNo!\n\nRINGO\nOh, he's gone to my club, has he?\n\nPAUL\n(turning on Ringo)\nYeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.\n\nJOHN\nWell, what are we waiting for?\n\nSHAKE\nAye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours\nis worse than any of you lot.\n\n31.\tINTERIOR  BOYD'S\n\nGRANDFATHER is drinking champagne in locked arms with BLONDE.\n\nWAITER\nEncore de champagne, Monsieur?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYes, and I'll have some more champagne as well.\n\nHe takes another swig of his glass.\n\nMANAGER\n(beaming)\nLord John McCartney, he's the millionaire Irish Peer, filthy rich of course.\n\nCUSTOMER\nOh I don't know, looks rather clean to me.\n\nThe MANAGER comes to grandfather's side.\n\nMANAGER\nPlay is about to resume, m'lord.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(handing him a chip)\nLead me to it, I've a winning itch that only success can pacify.\n\nHe takes his place at the table. The MANAGER watches for a moment then moves away from the table towards the club reception desk.\n\n32.\tINTERIOR  RECEPTION DESK  BOYD'S CLUB\n\nJOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, NORM and SHAKE are trying to gain entrance.\n\nATTENDANT\nI'm sorry sir, members and invited guests only.\n\nPAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, JOHN\nI've got to get in.\nIt's urgent and important.\nI've had an invite.\nTake me to your leader.\n\nNORM\nShurrup.\n\nThe BOYS do and meanwhile the MANAGER has walked into SHOT. He recognises the BOYS and welcomes them with false enthusiasm. They all start to enter the main room.\n\nNORM\nAll we want to know is have you got a little\nold man in there?\n\nMANAGER\n(pleasantly)\nDo you mean Lord McCartney?\n\nCLOSE-UP PAUL\n\nPAUL\nHe's at it again. Look, I'm his grandfather... I mean...\n\nBLONDE\n(standing next to Grandfather)\nOh, it must be the dolly floor show.\n\nJOHN\nStay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWho are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... (etc.)\n\nThey grab the protesting GRANDFATHER and drag him into the reception area. He keeps trying to return to BLONDE and table. GEORGE and RINGO each take an end of the velvet cord hanging between the two stanchions. They exchange ends and re-hook it, thus encircling GRANDFATHER by the\nentrance desk. They then go to settle up.\n\nMANAGER\n(with false charm)\nBefore you go, gentlemen, there's the small matter of the bill.\n\nHe snaps his fingers and a waiter hands him the bill.\n\nNORM\n(taking it)\nI'll settle that.\n\nHe glances at it.\n\nNORM\nA hundred and eighty pounds!\n\nMANAGER\n(icily)\nI beg your pardon, guineas.\n\nAt that moment a WAITER appears with a tray full of pound notes.\n\nWAITER\nYour winnings, my lord, one hundred and ninety\npounds.\n\nThe MANAGER tears up the bill and takes the money.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHow about me change?\n\nMANAGER\nCloak room charge.\n\nHe hands GRANDFATHER his old mackintosh.\n\nRINGO\n(brightly)\nAh well, easy come, easy go.\n\nThe others glower at him.\n\nRINGO\nWell.\n\n33.\tINTERIOR  BIG CAR (MOVING ON WAY TO STUDIOS)\n\nThe BOYS have settled down.\n\nJOHN\nShould I say it?\n\nGEORGE\nFollow your impulse.\n\nRINGO\nIt'll only get you into trouble.\n\nJOHN\n(to RINGO)\nAah, shurrup, misery!\n\nJOHN slouches forward.\n\nJOHN\n(urgently)\nO.K. Driver, follow that car!!\n\nThe driver [Frank] is an urbane young man in a handsome grey uniform.\n\nFRANK\n(indicating the traffic)\nWould you like to be a little more precise, sir?\n\nJOHN\nWell, that's the wrong line for a start.\n\nFRANK\nSorry?\n(meaning: \"I beg your pardon.\")\n\nGEORGE\nOh, don't pay any attention to him, he was just fulfilling a lifelong ambition.\n\nFRANK\nI see.\n\nJOHN\nYeah, you know, \"O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!\"\n\nFRANK\nOh, yes, now I'm with you.\n[he changes his accent]\nBut, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...\n\nThe car is stopped in traffic behind a bus. JOHN gets out of car and walks to the front. JOHN leans in window delightedly, he flashes his wallet.\n\nJOHN\nEver seen one of these before?\n\nFRANK\nAh ... a shamus, eh?\n\nJOHN\nI see you go to the night court.\n\nFRANK\nI've made the scene.\n\nJOHN\nWell, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.\n\nGEORGE\nI don't think that bit's right.\n\nJOHN\nWhat do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?\n\n\n34.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nAs the big car overtakes a Company Director's Rolls. JOHN lowers his window and the boys let out an imaginary hail of bullets at the Executive in the back. He reacts violently and starts to shout at them. As he does so, he presses the button of his window, so that we hear only part of it. But what we do is unpleasant. He immediately presses the button and the window rises.\n\nRINGO and PAUL jump out of the car. RINGO takes two drumsticks from his coat pocket and, using them as banderillas, inserts them with style into the radiator grill (V.O. \"Ole\" from the BOYS). PAUL, then, using his coat as a matador's cloak, does a butterfly pass at the car which\nhas just started up, narrowly missing him, but he keeps in the matador position.\n\n35.\tINTERIOR  CAR\n\nNORM\nWill you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.\n\nJOHN\n(as Ringo and Paul climb in)\nWell, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.\n\nFRANK\n(to Norm)\nWe're nearly there, sir.\n\nJOHN\nEh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.\n\nCLOSE SHOT of a long suffering NORM.\n\nNORM\nAnd I was happy in the bakery. I'll never know\nwhy I left.\n\n36.\tEXTERIOR OF AN OLD VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL THEATRE\n\nWhich has been converted to the T.V. studios.\n\nThere are a few groups of GIRL FANS standing outside the front of the theatre, but against the kerb of the pavement is a night-watchman's canvas hut and brazier.\n\nThe car approaches.\n\n37.\tINTERIOR OF THE CAR\n\nNORM\nGet ready John, open the door and as it draws up, out you go and straight in.\n\nJOHN nods and opens the door. The FANS start to swarm 'round them. To escape, the BOYS dash into the night-watchman's canvas hut, pick it up and run with it to the stage door, revealing the night watchman, staring in astonishment.\n\nAt the door the BOYS put the hut down and enter the theatre.\n\n38.\tINTERIOR  STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE\n\nAs the BOYS enter, two P.R.O. men in dark suits, stiff white collars\nand old school ties step forward and smile menacingly.\n\nFIRST P.R.O. MAN\n(menacingly)\nPress conference, they're waiting for you.\n\nNORM\n(jovially)\nGive us a couple of shakes to get our breath.\n\nFIRST P.R.O. MAN\n(more menacingly)\nThey're waiting now!\n\nAnd without more ado they grab an arm each and march the protesting NORM towards the stairs that lead to the dress circle.\n\nPAUL\nEh this lot means it. They're even taking\nhostages.\n\nThe BOYS, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER rush after the rapidly disappearing NORM, who by now is half way up the stairs.\n\n39.\tINTERIOR OF DRESS CIRCLE LOUNGE BALLROOM\n\nIt is empty except for two barmaids poised ready to serve, standing behind trestle tables full of drinks and sandwiches. The dark suited MEN enter with NORM and close behind them follow GRANDFATHER, SHAKE and the boys. The group arrives at the centre of the lounge and have time to look about and see the food but before they can get to it, from all directions NEWSPAPERMEN and PHOTOGRAPHERS converge upon them..\n\nNow begins an elaborate tug-of-war between various PHOTOGRAPHERS using their flash attachments and REPORTERS to capture a Beatle and in the midst of this running battle a man with a portable recorder is trying to interview them. Together and singly the BOYS are pushed about the room and while this goes on a hard core of NEWSPAPERMEN are busily devouring sandwiches and pouring themselves drinks, to the annoyance of the BARMAIDS.\n\nEvery time one of the BOYS attempts to get a sandwich or a drink, it is either too late, the plate is empty, or they are intercepted. The single and constant thing we see in the scene is the pushing and pulling, heavy impersonal handling, the boys are just things to be placed like still life in one advantageous position after another. During the scene these individual exchanges take place:\n\nSOUND REPORTER\nWhat's your philosophy of life?\n\nJOHN\nI'm torn between Zen and I'm all right, Jack.\n\nREPORTER\nHas success changed your life?\n\nRINGO\nYes.\n\nREPORTER\nDo you like playing the guitar?\n\nGEORGE\nNext to kissing girls it's favourites.\n\nPAUL is surrounded by newspapermen.\n\nPAUL\nNo, actually, we're just good friends.\n\nHIGH SHOT of the press reception and we see the BOYS ease their way out until they get to the curtained entrance to the dress circle; completely unnoticed, they slip through.\n\n40.\tINTERIOR  THEATRE DRESS CIRCLE\n\nThe BOYS come up the stairs into the Dress Circle proper. GRANDFATHER and SHAKE are sitting there having a picnic of beer and sandwiches.\n\nPAUL\n(ironically)\nAnything to spare?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWe've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.\n\nGEORGE\nSure.\n(He does so).\n\nPAUL\nAh well. Eh, look!\n\nHe points, and from PAUL'S P.O.V. we see on stage, the setting up of the show, scenery and lights, cameras and sound equipment are being put into position by a small army of studio staff. DANCERS and SINGERS are milling about as well.\n\nPAUL\nLet's go and muck in.\n\nJOHN\nAye, before anyone stops us.\n\nThey exit to rows of the dress circle and go through the entrance down the narrow stairs to the stalls and on to the stage that is built and extended right into the stalls, which are partly covered up.\n\n41.\tINTERIOR  STAGE\n\nEveryone is so busy that they hardly notice the BOYS, who wander about and examine the studio equipment. A load of three drum sets are being brought on stage and a voice shouts out:\n\nVOICE\nHere, what about these electric guitars?\n\nSHAKE\nWhere are they?\n\nVOICE\nBack here, mate.\n\nSHAKE\n(going towards the voice)\nI'm coming.\n\nRINGO is busy setting up his drums, and men are setting up the other sets. He drops a stick and the FLOOR MANAGER retrieves it and is about to tap the drum. The FLOOR MANAGER is a languid young man.\n\nRINGO\nLeave them drums alone.\n\nFLOOR MANAGER\nOh, surely one can have a tiny touch.\n\nRINGO\nIf you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm\nout on strike.\n\nFLOOR MANAGER\nAren't you being rather arbitrary?\n\nRINGO\nThat's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?\n\nFLOOR MANAGER\nSpoil sport!\n\nRINGO\nWell!\n\nRINGO fusses like a mother hen clucking over his drums. The FLOOR MANAGER is furious.\n\nGEORGE\nHe's very touchy about those his drums, they loom large in his legend.\n\nRINGO gives his drums a defiant crash and JOHN and PAUL stop whatever they are up to and hurry over.\n\nPAUL\nWhat's up?\n\nGEORGE\n(pointing)\nHe's sulking again.\n\nJOHN\nI'll show him.\n\nHe picks up a set of drum sticks and bashes back at RINGO, who does a more complicated drum roll. GEORGE now joins in and to PAUL'S encouragement a drum duel starts completely naturally and improvised. During this encounter the work proceeds around them and the guitars are brought on and SHAKE sets them to working order. PAUL first, then JOHN and GEORGE take up their own instruments and out of the drum duel emerges one of their numbers.\n\n42.\tINTERIOR  RAMP\n\nAs the number finishes a baldheaded man (he is the T.V. director) storms down the ramp that leads from the control box under the dress circle.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(with over-exaggerated calm)\nAll right I'm sorry and let's hear no more about it. If that's your opinion, you're probably right. Look, if you think I'm unsuitable let's have it out in the open, I can't stand these back-stage politics.\n\nBy the end of this speech he is standing in front of JOHN who takes the scene in his stride.\n\nJOHN\nAren't you tending to black and white this whole situation?\n\nDIRECTOR\nWell, quite honestly I wasn't expecting \"a musical arranger\" who would question my ability ... picture-wise.\n\nJOHN\n(to the others)\nI could listen to him for hours.\n\nPAUL\nHeave to, what's all this about a musical arranger?\n\nDIRECTOR\nMr. McCartney Senior!\n\nThe BOYS have a giggle at the very idea and at this moment GRANDFATHER appears from behind the DIRECTOR.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHey Pauly, they're trying to fob you off wid this musical charlatan but I've given him the test.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(bravely)\nI'm quite happy to be replaced.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(indicating the director)\nHe's a typical buck-passer.\n\nDIRECTOR\nI won an award.\n\nJOHN\nA likely story.\n\nDIRECTOR\nIt's on the wall in my office.\n\nAt this moment NORM comes on the stage, confident, cigar in mouth and serene.\n\nNORM\nHello our lot, everyone happy?\n\nThe BOYS, the DIRECTOR, FLOOR MANAGER and GRANDFATHER turn on him and stare silently.\n\nNORM\nAll right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.\n\nDIRECTOR\nPlease do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.\n\nHe glares at GRANDFATHER who glares right back. The DIRECTOR walks away with the FLOOR MANAGER pacifying him.\n\nDIRECTOR\nGive me a bottle of milk and a packet of\nOblivion. Oh, it's a plot, I see it now, it's\nall a plot.\n\nThey go left towards the back-stage.\n\nNORM\n(producing key)\nNow, come on, I've got the key.\n\nHe leads the lads off right. RINGO is last as he is putting his drum sticks down safely.\n\nNORM and the BOYS turn on him.\n\nNORM\nLet's have you.\n\nJOHN\nCome on speedy!\n\nPAUL\nRingo!\n\nGEORGE\nWake up!\n\nRINGO glares at them and follows quickly. As the BOYS move off after NORM, they pass the next act waiting for rehearsal. It is an elegant man in full-tail suit meticulously adjusting his cuff-links. Beside him is a free-standing sign reading \"Leslie Jackson and his ten disappearing doves.\" The BOYS pass him and go through the door. GRANDFATHER stops and looks at the performer with respect.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI can't tell you how much I've enjoyed your act.\n\nHe slaps the man on the back with happy camaraderie. There is the sound of a dove, a few feathers fall out of the sleeve of the man's coat and he and GRANDFATHER look down at the floor. The man glares at GRANDFATHER, takes out a pen from his pocket, crosses out \"10\" on his sign, and writes \"9\" in its place, puts the pen back in his pocket and starts towards the centre stage putting on a false performer's smile as he does.\n\n43.\tINTERIOR  THEATRE  BACK-STAGE CORRIDOR\n\nThe BOYS move down the narrow stairs, and out of the ground floor dressing rooms stream a steady flow of costumed actors and actresses. They engulf the lads and force them against the wall -- the actors are all making for the stage door. As the actors push past the boys we see the boys' excited faces, their mouths watering for the costumes. JOHN touches the costume on one actor.\n\nJOHN\n(to actor)\nGear costume!\n\nACTOR\n(eyeing him)\nSwap?\n\nNORM\nRight, first floor and no messing about.\n\nNORM, leading the way, goes up the stairs but as they turn the first corner they are confronted by a group of girls, a game of manners starts, \"after you,\" \"No, after you.\" NORM who is ahead of the group looks down on them in disgust.\n\nNORM\nLennon, leave them girls alone or I'll report you.\n\nThe BOYS let the GIRLS pass and resume the journey, always surrounded by people.\n\n44.\tINTERIOR  DRESSING ROOM AND CORRIDOR\n\nRINGO'S attention is caught by a door. He crosses and opens it, looking out to a fire escape. The others join him and the four boys step through the door and onto the fire escape.\n\n45.\tEXTERIOR  TOP OF FIRE ESCAPE\n\nFrom the BOYS' P.O.V. we see down below into the property yard behind nthe theatre. It is a long narrow yard full of old coaches, motor cars and all the general debris of hundreds of sets from past theatre shows. Through the piles of heaped high junk there are a couple of narrow alleyways.\n\nThe BOYS scamper down the fire escape.\n\nWhen they reach the bottom of the alleyways, there is a large door. They open it and look through.\n\nFrom their P.O.V. we see a large green field quite empty. The boys step through the doorway into the field. We now see from a HELICOPTER SHOT the four BOYS standing together surrounded by space.\n\nIt is the first time they have been alone and unconfined all day.\n\nThey look at each other and grin ... then first GEORGE and PAUL let out a whoop and run towards the centre of the field, after a moment JOHN and RINGO follow them. The BOYS pick up some loose straw and insert it under JOHN'S cap and sleeves, turning him into a scarecrow.\n\nThe four BOYS dash about madly calling out to one another and generally horsing around. Out of this emerges an imaginary game of soccer and although there is no ball the game is fast and furious. After a few moments the long shadow of a man falls across the grass.\n\nMAN'S VOICE\n(off)\nI suppose you know this is private property.\n\nThe boys freeze.\n\nFrom their P.O.V. we see a big burly middle-aged man glowering at them. The boys exchange rueful glances and, under the big man's eye, mooch back towards the gateway they came in by. JOHN is the last to go through. He turns to the man.\n\nJOHN\nSorry if we hurt your field, Mister.\n46.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR  BACK-STAGE\n\nGRANDFATHER is sneaking down the corridor, a pile of photos under his arm.\n\n47.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  UNDERNEATH THE STAGE\n\nUnder the stage the usual set of wooden columns that support the stage with lots of furniture and a single light is on; it is placed by the orchestra's entrance to the orchestra pit. GRANDFATHER comes down the stairs and winds his way through the columns until he finds himself a safe little cubby hole and settles himself under the light. He spreads the signed photos of the BOYS in front of him and, adjusting an old- fashioned pair of glasses, ball-point pen in hand begins to copy the BOYS' signatures on to the fresh photos, tutting at his failures and chuckling at his successes. After a moment, there is a sound of someone coming down the stairs. GRANDFATHER darts into a dark patch out of sight.\n\nThe menacing shadows appear on the stairway.\n\nNORM (voice off)\nThere's no one here.\n\nSHAKE (voice off)\nThis is the only way they could have gone.\n\nWe now see GRANDFATHER holding himself stiffly in, he is on some sort of raised platform and he fidgets and in doing so he knocks a lever of some sort. Slowly GRANDFATHER ascends out of shot with a light that grows bigger above him.\n\n48.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE STAGE\n\nA rehearsal of the toast scene from a Strauss Operetta. The entire stage is full of SINGERS, glasses in hand they are singing away at each other but in true opera tradition they are addressing out to the audience. Slowly in-between the leading man and leading woman, who are about to embrace, a stage trap opens and a blinking, surprised, GRANDFATHER appears. Here we INTERCUT to the T.V. Control Room for amazed reaction shots of the DIRECTOR and control room CREW.\n\nBack now on the stage the toast song reaches its climax and the leading man and woman rush into each other's arms, GRANDFATHER sandwiched between them.\n\n\n48A.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR AS BOYS PASS THRU ON WAY TO DRESSING ROOM\n\nJOHN is behind them. JOHN, BOYS and MILLIE are walking towards each other.\n\nMILLIE\n(as all pass)\nHello.\n\nJOHN\n(stopping... the boys carry on past, not noticing her)\nHello.\n\nMILLIE\nOh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...\n\nJOHN\nNo, not me.\n\nMILLIE\n(insistently)\nOh you are, I know you are.\n\nJOHN\nNo, I'm not.\n\nMILLIE\nYou are.\n\nJOHN\nI'm not, no.\n\nMILLIE\nWell, you look like him.\n\nJOHN\nOh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.\n\nMILLIE\nOh you do, look.\n\nJOHN looks at himself in the mirror.\n\nJOHN examines himself in the mirror carefully.\n\nJOHN\nMy eyes are lighter.\n\nMILLIE\n(agreeing)\nOh yes.\n\nJOHN\nAnd my nose...\n\nMILLIE\nWell, yes your nose is. Very.\n\nJOHN\nIs it?\n\nMILLIE\nI would have said so.\n\nJOHN\nAye, but you know him well.\n\nMILLIE\n(indignantly)\nNo I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.\n\nJOHN\n(knowingly)\nThat's what you tell me.\n\nMILLIE\n(suspiciously)\nWhat have you heard?\n\nJOHN\n(blandly)\nIt's all over the place, everyone knows.\n\nMILLIE\nIs it? Is it really?\n\nJOHN\nMind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.\n\nMILLIE\nI knew I could rely on you.\n\nJOHN\n(modestly)\nThanks.\n\nMILLIE touches his arm then walks away. After a moment she turns.\n\nMILLIE\nYou don't look like him at all.\n\nJOHN winks at her and she winks back.\n49.\tINTERIOR  DRESSING ROOM\n\nNORM and SHAKE enter the room. The BOYS' TAILOR is there waiting for the BOYS.\n\nSHAKE\nOh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.\n\nNORM\nThat's too easy for Lennon.\n\nHe crosses to door leading to fire escape.\n\nNORM\n(dramatically)\nHe's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.\n\nSHAKE\nYou're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.\n\nNORM\nOh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.\n\nSHAKE\nBut John hasn't got any.\n\nNORM\nWhat?\n\nSHAKE\nNerves.\n\nNORM\nI know, that's the trouble.\n\nHe puffs nervously at his cigarette.\n\nNORM\nOh, I've toyed with the idea of a ball and chain but he'd only rattle them at me... and in public and all. Sometimes I think he enjoys seeing me suffer.\n\nHe hears something.\n\nNORM\nGet behind that door, they're coming. Someone's coming. Quick, hide!\n\nThe two men hide behind the door. The boys enter the room, as JOHN is last he shuts the door and faces SHAKE and NORM.\n\nJOHN\nWhat are you doing there?\n\nSHAKE\nHiding.\n\nJOHN\nI think you're soft or something.\n\nNORM\nWe weren't hiding.\n\nTAILOR\nNow?\n\nNORM\nNow. We were trying to catch you redhanded. I thought I told you lot to stay here?\n\nRINGO\nWell ...\n\nNORM\nWhen I tell you to stay put, stay put.\n\nJOHN\n(down on his knees)\nDon't cane me, sir, I was led astray.\n\nNORM\nOh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting\nfor you in the studio.\n\nRINGO\nOh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.\n\nNORM\nGood lad, Ringo.\n\nPAUL\nOh, listen to teacher's pet.\n\nGEORGE\nYou crawler.\n\nJOHN\nHe's betrayed the class.\n\nRINGO\nOh, leave off!!!\n\nJOHN\nTemper! Temper!\n\nRINGO\nWell ...\n\nCLOSE-UP on NORM's long suffering face.\n\nNORM\nWill you all get a move on! They're waiting for\nyou!\n\nBy this time the TAILOR has his tape stretched between his hands to measure GEORGE's shoulders. But since GEORGE has moved away, he is measuring space. JOHN takes up his scissors and cuts the tape.\nJOHN\nI now declare this bridge open.\n\nThe BOYS run out the door.\n\n50.\tINTERIOR  BACKSTAGE AREA\n\nFive beautiful MODELS are standing about in costume. One is knitting a loose wool sweater which is almost completed. There is the sound of a juggling act's music off and a few of the girls are looking off towards the centre stage. At the edge of frame is a collapsible table covered with green baize. On it are three spaced white plates.\n\nFrom the door off stage, above which is a sign \"To Canteen and Production Offices\", GRANDFATHER enters eating a plate of spaghetti on toast. The knitting GIRL sees him and, in mime, asks him to stand still so that she can measure the sweater against him. GRANDFATHER, eager to help, puts his plate of food on the green table between plates two and\nthree. He goes to be measured with the sweater.\n\nFrom the onstage area, a juggler's ASSISTANT (pretty girl) in costume backs up and with the usual theatrical flourishes picks up, without looking, plate number ONE and throws it off screen towards centre stage. There is a drum roll from orchestra. She then throws plate number TWO. We CUT on stage to the JUGGLER now balancing the two spinning plates on two poles, one in each hand. He has another pole in his mouth and nods to his ASSISTANT, asking for the THIRD plate.\n\nWe CUT BACK to the ASSISTANT who, still not looking, throws plate THREE which is GRANDFATHER's. There is the sound of an orchestra raggedly stopping and all the hangers-on in the scene look off interestedly.\n\nWe hear the DIRECTOR's voice.\n\nDIRECTOR (V.O.)\nAll right, hold it, hold it... O.K. John, wipe him down and we'll carry on with the next act.\n\nWe\n\nCUT TO\n\ncentre stage. The JUGGLER is as before but the spaghetti is covering his head, having slipped off the third plate.\n\nThe FLOOR MANAGER is bustling around, trying to help.\n\nWe CUT BACK to back-stage. GRANDFATHER has finished being measured and goes to the green table where he put his plate down. He picks up the only remaining plate, looks at it, wondering where his food has gone, shrugs and heads back towards the exit door as we hear the DIRECTOR's VOICE.\n\n51.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\n\nCLOSE-UP on the distraught DIRECTOR.\n\nDIRECTOR\nWhere are they? I said, where are they? Where are they?\n\nFLOOR MANAGER\n(placating)\nThey're coming, I promise you.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(fiercely)\nNow look, if they're not here on this floor in thirty seconds there's going to be trouble ... understand me ... trouble!!!\n\nTwo STAGE HANDS are walking disinterestedly past, they look at the DIRECTOR.\n\n1st STAGE HAND\nWhat's he on about, Taff?\n\nWELSH STAGE HAND\nWell ... he's being the director. Of course, he lives in a world of his own, mind.\n\nAt this moment the boys, NORM, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER appear. The BOYS grab their instruments and prepare to play.\n\nJOHN\n(to the director)\nStanding about, eh? Some people have it dead easy, don't they?\n\nThe director is about to blow his top but manages to hold on and mutter to the heavens.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(to himself)\nOf course, once you're over thirty, you're finished. It's a young man's medium and I just can't take the pace.\n\nRINGO\nAre you as young as that, then?\n\nBOYS\nShurrup!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nIsn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.\n\nPAUL\n(to Shake)\nShove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?\n\nSHAKE\nI'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.\n\nPAUL\n(threateningly)\nI'll set John on you!\n\nSHAKE\n(hastily)\nOh, anything you say, Paul.\n\nHe leads GRANDFATHER away.\n\nThe BOYS are placed in position, instruments ready. The boom moves in near them. There is a mike hovering just over JOHN'S head. JOHN starts attacking it.\n\nDIRECTOR'S VOICE (over Tannoy)\nRun through the number and try not to jiggle out of your positions.\n\nThe BOYS start the number, as the stage hands adjust their settings. When they've finished, they stand about spare.\n\n52.\tINTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM\n\nThe room is crowded with the usual personnel, P.A., elecs, racks, etc.... make-up supervisor and wardrobe mistress.\n\nDIRECTOR\nThat was more or less all right for me. I'll give them one more run through then leave them alone until the dress ...\n(to make-up woman)\nOh how about make-up?\n\nMAKE-UP WOMAN\nNot really, they don't need it any. We'll just powder them off for shine.\n\nDIRECTOR\nGood. Norm, get them along to make-up will you?\n\nNORM\n(rising)\nSure.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(looking into the monitor)\nAnd hurry, they're not looking too happy.\n\nFrom the director's P.O.V. we see into the monitor. The boys crowding around RINGO. We cut through the monitor into the same position in the studio.\n\n53.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\n\nPAUL\n(to Ringo)\nWhat's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.\n\nRINGO\n(briefly)\nYou were twanging too loud.\n\nJOHN\nHow'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?\n\nGEORGE\nYou're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.\n\nRINGO\nThat's right. It's always me, isn't it?\n\nJOHN\nSince you ask, yes.\n(he laughs)\nAah, come on, Ring, we love you.\n\nHe puts his arm around Ringo's shoulder.\n\nRINGO\nWell!\n\nJOHN\nHe'll get over it.\n\nNORM appears down the ramp speaking as he approaches.\n\nNORM\nAll right, our lot, make-up.\n\n54.\tINTERIOR  MAKE UP ROOM\n\nA smallish room with a line of chairs facing a wall mirror and a long table. Each place is clearly marked and above each mirror a girl's name: Betty, Angela, Deirdre, Jenny.\n\nSHAKE and GRANDFATHER are sitting in splendid isolation. They are staring each other out.\n\nSHAKE\nYou blinked!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI never did, you did.\n\nThe BOYS enter.\n\nSHAKE\nHello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.\n\nGEORGE\nWell, it must be catching. He's given it to the\nchamp here.\n\nHe indicates RINGO who ignores him.\n\nNORM\nStop picking on him.\n\nRINGO\nI don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.\n\nJOHN\nLeave him alone, he's got swine fever.\n\nNORM\nSit down, the lot of you.\n\nAt this moment several actors come into the room. They are all dressed in the uniform of officers in Wellington's army. Together with the boys they sit down, Beatles and soldiers all mixed up.\n\nNow a group of several pretty make-up girls make an entrance and the boys herald their arrival with a chorus of \"aye aye's\" and wolf whistles. JOHN meanwhile has helped himself to a big beard and the other lads are generally messing about with assorted make-up things.\n\nHEAD MAKE UP GIRL\nOh, this is impossible! We'll never get you all done in time.\n\nACTOR\nWell, you'll just have to do us first... It makes no difference to them whether they're made up or not.\n(sees John with beard)\nAnd who's me, then?\n\nJOHN\n(charmingly)\nMy name's Betty...\n(pointing to the name on the mirror)\nDo you want a punch up your frogged tunic?\n\nNORM fights his way to JOHN.\n\nNORM\nNow listen, John, behave yourself or I'll murder you and, Shake, take that wig off, it suits you.\n\nSHAKE has a long blond girl's wig on. With the assistance of the girls, NORM gets the boys seated into the chairs nearest the door. For some reason RINGO now has a Guardsman's busby wedged down almost over his eyes and is sitting with it under a hair drier, reading a copy of \"Queen\" Magazine.\n\nNORM\n(to Ringo)\nWhat do you think are you're up to?\n\nRINGO\nSomeone put it on me.\n\nJOHN\nExcuses, that's all we get and you know you fancy yourself in the Coldstreams.\n\nThe GIRLS now move in and put make up bibs on the BOYS and start to powder them off.\n\nJOHN\nYou won't interfere with the basic rugged\nconcept of my personality, will you, girl?\n\nPAUL\nEh, don't take out me lines.\n\nGEORGE\nYeah, they give him that \"Je ne sais quoi\"\nrakish air.\n\nThe lads laugh with pleasure.\n\nRINGO decides to try a little joke.\n\nRINGO\n(indicating the busby he is still\nwearing)\nShort back and sides, please.\n\nThe other look at him with mock disgust.\n\nPAUL\nBehave...\n\nJOHN\nForeign devil ...\n\nGEORGE\nControl yourself...\n\nGRANDFATHER has been watching the powdering process.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nIn my considered opinion you're a bunch of sissies.\n\nJOHN grabs a powder puff from his girl.\n\nJOHN\nYou know you're only jealous!\n\nAnd dabs the old man liberally with the powder much to GRANDFATHER's annoyance.\n\nNORM\nLeave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.\n\nJOHN\nYou wouldn't!\n\nNORM\nI would though.\n\nNORM goes out.\n\nPAUL\nWhat's he know?\n\nJOHN\nNothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(impatiently)\nLookit, I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery and so far I've seen a train and a room, a car and a room and a room and a room. Well, that's maybe all right for a bunch of powdered gee-gaws like you lot but I'm feeling decidedly strait-jacketed. This is no life for a free-booting agent of my stamp. I'm a frustrated man and that class of McCartney is a dangerous McCartney.\n\nGIRL\n(admiringly)\nWhat a clean old man.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(touchingly)\nYou're too young for a fella of my cosmopolitan tastes, so don't press your luck.\n\nJOHN\nHe's sex-obsessed, the older generation are leading this country to galloping ruin.\n\nNORM returns leaving the door open, the boys hear the sound of music coming from the studio.\n\nNORM\nThey're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.\n\nJOHN\n(jumping from his seat)\nGear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.\n\nJOHN'S GIRL\nI don't think its allowed.\n\nJOHN\nWell ... it wouldn't be any fun if it was!\n\nThe BOYS drag the make-up GIRLS out of the room and into the studio.\n\nThe GIRLS are still trying to finish making the BOYS up.\n\nAs the BOYS and MAKE-UP GIRLS dance past, we see one of the \"Strauss\" singers combing his long hair straight back. Two STAGE HANDS swing a wind machine past him and his hair is blown straight forward into a Beatle cut.\n\nJOHN\n(passing him)\nNever.\n\nDuring dance, GEORGE takes off wig and places it on dummy, revealing identical hair underneath.\n\n55.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\n\nThe work is still going on and the music is up full blast, the BOYS enter and with the GIRLS [and] they start a wild dance, hippy, shake, zulu, blue beat, the lot. LIONEL and DANCERS are doing their routine on one side of the stage ... it becomes a challenge dance between both groups. JOHN swings his GIRL onto the motorized CAMERA, Western style, and starts to track through the GROUP. GEORGE is on another CAMERA.\n\n56.\tINTERIOR  CONTROL ROOM\n\nThe whole control room crew are watching the dance on all the monitors. The DIRECTOR is about to stop the boys but his GIRL P.A. glares at him, with a shrug he lets the dance go on.\n\nWe now cut between the dancers on the monitors and the boys actual dancing down on the studio floor. When the recorded music stops, they grab their instruments and go into a number.\n\nSo we can watch every aspect of their work and with so many monitors it gives the impression that there are many more boys than just four.\n\nWhen the number finally ends we are back in the studio on the floor.\n\n57.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\n\nDIRECTOR'S VOICE OVER TANNOY\nThank you gentlemen, you can break now while we push on with the show.\n\nThe boys acknowledge this with a quaver of guitar chords and a drum roll.\n\nNORM is on them at once.\n\nNORM\nThat was great, you've got about an hour but don't leave the theatre.\n\nJOHN grabs the arm of a sexy girl dancer.\n\nJOHN\nShe's going to show me her stamp collection.\n\nPAUL\n(grabs a showgirl)\nSo's mine.\n\nNORM\nJohn, I'm talking to you. This final run through is important. Understand? Important.\n\nJOHN\n(like a pig)\nOink! Oink!\n\nThey dash off with the two beauties.\n\nGRANDFATHER is hovering in the background with SHAKE.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI want me cup of tea.\n\nNORM\nShake.\n\nSHAKE\nI'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.\n\nNORM\nClever.\n(he turns)\nGeorge.\n\nBut GEORGE is disappearing out of the door.\n\nNORM turns to RINGO.\n\nNORM\nLook after him.\n\nRINGO\nBut...\n\nNORM\nDo I have to raise me voice?\n\nRINGO\n(choked)\nOh, all right. Come here, Grandad.\n\nAnd the two of them walk off, Ringo leading.\n57A.\tINTERIOR  BACKSTAGE\n\nA man, whose act is playing tunes by hitting himself on the head, is swallowing a handful of aspirin tablets. He starts rehearsing his act, which consists of throwing his head back and slapping his cheeks. Next to him, a JUGGLER is practising with four table tennis balls.\n\nGRANDFATHER passes him and bumps his arm slightly. Only 3 balls come down. There is the sound of coughing off.\n\nWe\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HEAD-PLAYER being patted on the back. The ball drops out of his mouth and bounces slowly on the studio floor.\n\n58.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO CANTEEN\n\nThe canteen is about half full of actors many of which are dressed as Nazi soldiers, with mock blood bandages and arm bands. Also there are a sprinkling of T.V. people. At a table sits GRANDFATHER and RINGO. RINGO is deeply engrossed in a book and GRANDFATHER has a near empty cup of tea in front of him. The old man is bored and looks about him slyly. He then looks at Ringo who is innocently occupied, a malicious gleam comes into GRANDFATHER's eye. He decides to have a go at RINGO and sits staring at him. RINGO gradually becomes aware of the stare and shifts uncomfortably then tries to continue reading his book.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(disgustedly to no one in particular)\nWill you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!\n\nRINGO\nWell ... what's the matter with that?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(taking the book from him)\nHave you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?\n\nRINGO\n(snatching back his book)\nYou can learn from books.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nCan you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.\n\nRINGO\nOut where?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAny old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!\n\nRINGO\n(defiantly)\nBooks are good!\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(countering)\nParading's better!\n\nRINGO\nParading?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(marching up and down the canteen)\nThat's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!\n\nRINGO\nWell, I am living, aren't I?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYou're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?\n\nRINGO\nEh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAt least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!\n\nRINGO\nAaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nSo you are a man after all.\n\nRINGO\nWhat's that mean?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nDo you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.\n\nRINGO\n(not too sure)\nOh ... I dunno.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(confidingly)\nAnd that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.\n\nRINGO\nYeah ... that's right.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd what's it all come to in the end?\n\nRINGO\n(defensively)\nYeah ... what's in it for me?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nA book!\n\nRINGO\nYeah ... a bloomin' book!\n\nHe throws the book down.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWhen you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.\n\nRINGO\nYeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(nodding)\nYou're only right.\n\nRINGO\n(nodding back)\nI'm not wrong.\n\nThere is a pause, then RINGO rises and crosses to the door.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWhere are you off to?\n\nRINGO\nI'm going parading before it's too late!\n\nRINGO leaves and GRANDFATHER laughs at what he has done, then realizes its full meaning and looks worried.\n\n59.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR and STAIRWAY\n\nRINGO comes along the corridor then down the narrow stairs. Half-way down he comes face to face with GEORGE who is coming up the stairs.\n\nGEORGE\nEh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?\n\nRINGO\n(passing him)\nNo. I don't.\n\nAs he goes round the corner RINGO turns on the surprised GEORGE.\n\nRINGO\nYou want to stop being so scornful, it's twisting your face.\n\n60.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOORMAN'S OFFICE\n\nJOHN and PAUL are chatting up a couple of girls, when they see RINGO approaching they break off the conversation.\n\nJOHN\nHere he is, the middle-aged boy wonder.\n\nRINGO looks at JOHN hard.\n\nPAUL\nEh. I thought you were looking after the old man.\n\nRINGO\n(with simple dignity)\nGet knotted!\n\nPAUL and JOHN gape at him. For good measure Ringo takes a quick photograph of them before he leaves them flabbergasted and walks off into the street.\n\nPAUL\nWe've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.\n\nJOHN\nCan't he? He's done it, son!\n\nGEORGE runs towards them.\n\nGEORGE\nEh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...\n\nPAUL\nWe do.\n\nGEORGE\nYes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.\n\nPAUL\nHe hasn't.\n\nGEORGE\nYes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.\n\nPAUL\nThe old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.\n\nThe three of them go into the street.\n\n61.\tEXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE\n\nThe boys look up and down but RINGO has completely disappeared.\n\nPAUL\nWe'll split up and search for him, he can't be far.\n\nThey now all start to go off in the same direction, they pause, there are three roads they can take but each time they begin to move they all go the same way.\n\nJOHN\nIt's happened at last, we've become a limited company.\n\nGEORGE\nI'll look in here again.\n\nPAUL gives him a push to the left and GEORGE to the right and going straight ahead himself they part and go their separate ways.\n\n62.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nRINGO is walking along taking photographs with his camera when some girls recognise him and start to follow him. They quicken their pace and RINGO runs ahead of them. He turns and comes into another street. He sees a second-hand clothes shop with a sign saying \"We Buy Anything\" and enters the shop just before the pursuing girls come round the corner. The girls stand about looking in all directions. After a moment RINGO comes out of the shop. He is wearing a long mackintosh and a natty cap pulled well down. He is ignored by the girls who don't recognise him. Realising this he goes back and ogles one of them. She glares at him.\n\nRINGO\nHello.\n\nGIRL\nGet out of it, short house!\n\nCLOSE-UP on Ringo's secret but happy smile as he walks briskly down the road.\n\n63.\tEXTERIOR  TOW PATH  CANAL\n\nRINGO kicks at a brick. He kicks stylishly but misses so tries again, misses again, but finally kicks the stone which doesn't budge so he bends down and pulls it out of the ground. It is quite big. Three quarters of it being below the surface. Having got it he now decides to throw it away. As he does so the same POLICEMAN rides past on a bicycle.\n\nPOLICEMAN\nAin't you got no more bleeding sense than to go round chucking bricks about.\n\nBefore RINGO has time to answer the man has disappeared.\n\nRINGO\n(shouting after him)\nSoutherner!\n\nHe looks at the canal water moodily; at this moment a large lorry tyre rolls down the incline and bashes him slap in the back, sprawling him on the path, the tyre on top of him. A small boy appears after the tyre and stands over the prostrate RINGO.\n\nBOY\nHere, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.\n\nRINGO\nHoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?\n\nBOY\nOh don't be so stroppy!\n\nRINGO\n(getting up)\nWell! A boy of your age bowling \"hoop\" at people. How old are you anyway?\n\nBOY\n(aggressively)\nNine.\n\nRINGO\nBet you're only eight and a half.\n\nBOY\n(countering swiftly)\nEight and two thirds.\nRINGO\nWell, there you are and watch it with that hoop.\n\nBOY\nGerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.\n\nRINGO\nShurrup!\n\nBOY\nI bet you're\n(searching for an age)\n-- sixteen!\n\nRINGO\nFifteen and two thirds, actually.\n\nBOY\nWell --\n\nRINGO\nAll right, take your hoop and bowl.\n\nHe moves off and the BOY follows.\n\nBOY\nOh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.\n\nRINGO\nY'what?\n\nBOY\nYou heard, it gets on my wick.\n\nRINGO\nWell that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?\n\nBOY\nI'm a deserter.\n\nRINGO\n(smiling in spite of himself)\nAre you now?\n\nBOY\nYeah, I've blown school out.\n\nRINGO\nJust you?\n\nBOY\nNo, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.\n\nRINGO\nDing Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?\n\nBOY\nYeah, that's right, they was supposed to come\nwith us but they chickened.\n\nRINGO\nYeah? And they're your mates are they?\n\nBOY\n(sighing)\nYeah.\n\nRINGO\nNot much cop without 'em, is it?\n\nBOY\n(defensively)\nOh, it's all right.\n\nRINGO\n(disbelievingly)\nYeah?\n\nBOY\nYeah.\n\nRINGO\nWhat they like?\n\nBOY is glad to have something to talk about.\n\nBOY\n(enthusiastically)\nGinger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.\n\nRINGO\nHow about Ding Dong?\n\nBOY\nHe's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.\n\nRINGO nods his head understandingly and they mooch on together.\n\nBOY\nWhy aren't you at work?\n\nRINGO\nI'm a deserter, too.\n\nBOY\nOh.\n\nAt this moment a child's voice shouts out \"Charley\" and from RINGO'S P.O.V. we see three kids. RINGO turns to the BOY and looks at them enquiringly.\n\nBOY\n(to Ringo)\nSee you.\n\nThe BOY runs off to join his mates. As he joins them they punch and scuffle together. They are obviously a gang. RINGO is left alone.\n\n64.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR T.V. THEATRE\n\nGEORGE comes round the corner, looking for RINGO, then grins and walks past a sign saying \"Canteen and Production Office Opposite.\" He comes to the exit door, crosses to a modern building across from the theatre. He enters [the] building.\n\n65.\tINTERIOR  OFFICE\n\nIt is the reception room that leads to an inner office. Behind a desk sits a smart young woman typing busily as GEORGE enters. He is surprised when he sees the girl; she looks up and speaks to him at once.\n\nSECRETARY\nOh, there you are!\n\nGEORGE\nOh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.\n\nSECRETARY\n(tartly)\nYou haven't, you're just late.\n(She rises and crossing over to him examines him critically.)\nOh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.\n\nGEORGE\nIs he?\n\nSECRETARY\nYes, you're quite a feather in the cap.\n(She crosses to the desk and picks up the inter-office phone.)\nHello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.\n(she smiles)\nOf course, right away.\n\nShe crosses to the inter-office door. On the door is written SIMON MARSHAL ... she opens it.\n\nSECRETARY\nWell ... come on.\n\nGEORGE\nSorry.\n\nHe follows her quickly in.\n\n66.\tINTERIOR  THE INNER OFFICE\n\nA large room, part production office with models and sets, drawing board with ground plans, the other part of the room a mixture of Pop and Queen's magazine decor.\n\nBehind a large desk sits SIMON MARSHAL, a bland but slightly irritable young man of about thirty-five. He is wearing the ultimate in the current smart set fashion. He is attended by a couple of underlings ADRIAN and TONY and behind him on the wall is a poster of a girl. Across the poster is printed, \"Way Out, your own T.V. Special with Susan Campey. Director, Simon Marshal.\"\n\nSECRETARY\n(proudly)\nWill this do, Simon?\n\nSIMON\n(looking at George)\nNot bad, dolly, not really bad.\n(he motions to George)\nTurn around, chicky baby.\n\nGEORGE does so.\n\nSIMON\nOh yes, a definite poss. He'll look good alongside Susan.\n(he indicates the girl on the poster)\nAll right, Sunny Jim, this is all going to be quite painless. Don't breathe on me, Adrian.\n\nADRIAN has recognised GEORGE and is trying to stop SIMON.\n\nGEORGE\nLook, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.\n\nSIMON\n(sharply)\nOh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.\n\nGEORGE\nI'm afraid I don't understand.\n\nSIMON\nOh, my God, he's a natural.\n\nSECRETARY (anxiously)\nWell, I did tell them not to send us any more real ones.\n\nSIMON\nThey ought to know by now the phonies are much easier to handle. Still he's a good type.\n\nHe now speaks to GEORGE in the loud voice that the English reserve for foreigners and village idiots.\n\nSIMON\nWe want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.\n\nGEORGE\nOh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.\n\nSIMON\nWell, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.\n(to secretary)\nCan he read?\n\nGEORGE\nOf course I can.\n\nSIMON\nI mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?\n\nGEORGE\nI'll have a bash.\n\nSIMON\nGood. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?\n\nGEORGE\nTa.\n\nSIMON\nWell, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.\n\nA collection of shirts are produced and GEORGE looks at them. While he is doing this SIMON briefs him.\n\nSIMON\nNow, you'll like these. You really \"dig\" them. They're \"fab\" and all the other pimply hyperboles.\n\nGEORGE\nI wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.\n\nSIMON\nGrotty?\n\nGEORGE\nYeah, grotesque.\n\nSIMON\n(to secretary)\nMake a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.\n\nGEORGE\nBut I won't.\n\nSIMON\nYou can be replaced you know, chicky baby.\n\nGEORGE\nI don't care.\n\nSIMON\nAnd that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.\n\nGEORGE\nAnd who's this Susan when she's at home?\n\nSIMON\n(playing his ace)\nOnly Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.\n\nGEORGE\nOh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?\n\nSIMON\nI beg your pardon?\n\nGEORGE\nOh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.\n\nSIMON\nShe's a trend setter. It's her profession!\n\nGEORGE\nShe's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.\n\nSIMON\nGet him out of here!!\n\nGEORGE\n(genuinely surprised)\nHave I said something amiss?\n\nSIMON\nGet him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!\n\nThe underlings hustle GEORGE to the door.\n\nGEORGE\n(smiling)\nSorry about the shirts.\n\nHe is ejected through the door.\n\nSIMON\nGet him out.\n(he stops in mid-shout)\nYou don't think he's a new phenomenon, do you?\n\nSECRETARY\nYou mean an early clue to the new direction?\n\nSIMON\n(rummaging in his desk)\nWhere's the calendar?\n(he finds it)\nNo, he's just a trouble maker. The change isn't due for three weeks. All the same, make a note not to extend Susan's contract. Let's not take any unnecessary chances!\n\n67.\tEXTERIOR  STREET  PUB ON THE CORNER\n\nThe sign on the pub is Liverpool Arms. RINGO is standing looking up at it. He decides to go in and does so.\n\n68.\tINTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM\n\nThe atmosphere is tense. GRANDFATHER is standing miserable in front of the DIRECTOR, the criminal confronted by the judge. SHAKE and NORM are flanking him grimly.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI'm sorry lads, I didn't mean it, honest.\n\nDIRECTOR\nIf he says that again, I'll strike him.\n\nSHAKE\n(unconvincingly)\nThey'll be back, they're good lads, they'll be back.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(disgusted)\nYes? Well they've got only ten minutes to the final run-through.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI meant no harm. I was only trying to encourage little Ringo to enjoy himself.\n\nNORM\n(grimly, C.U.)\nGod knows what you've unleashed on the unsuspecting South. It'll be wine, women and song all the way with Ringo once he's got the taste for it.\n\n69.\tINT. PUB  PUBLIC BAR\n\nCLOSE-UP on RINGO. He is eating a bone dry sandwich that curls up at the end. He puts it down with disgust. He has a lager glass in his hand.\n\nBARMAID\n(accusingly)\nThat was fresh this morning.\n\nWe now see the pub is full of enormous cockney workmen downing pints. RINGO is very much alone. He moves away from the bar towards a group that is standing together, they've an average height of over six-foot. There is a group at a dart board. Another group is playing bar skittles and a third group is around a pin-ball table.\n\nNear the bar is a shove-halfpenny board with two players. There is a caged parrot nearby.\n\nBARMAID\n(to Ringo)\nThat'll be two and nine...\n\nRINGO fumbles some change out of his pocket. A few coppers fall from his hand on to the shove-halfpenny board just as the crucial point has been made. The men glare at him. Embarrassed, he moves away and without looking, places his glass on the skittles table just as a player swings the string, which hits Ringo's glass. More embarrassed, RINGO backs\naway, unfortunately into the pin-table just as a winning score is about to be reached. He bumps it very slightly, but enough to cause it to TILT. He then moves to the dart board. By this time most of the pub is staring at him. With great style he takes the darts. The first throw goes into a cheese sandwich which a man is pointing in demonstration. The second we see arrive into a pint of bitter and then we see RINGO shoot the third dart and hear the sound of the parrot shouting angrily, off. The BARMAID has had enough.\n\nBARMAID\nRight ... On your way!\n\nRINGO\nY'what?\n\nBARMAID\nYou heard, on your way, troublemaker!\n\nNow the centre of attention, RINGO backs out of the pub, followed by every eye in the place, the BARMAID and a few players following him to the door ...\n\n70.\tEXTERIOR  STREET OUTSIDE PUB\n\nRINGO comes out and crosses road, watched by the POLICEMAN who is now quite suspicious.\n\n71.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nPAUL comes down the street looking about him for RINGO. In the street is an old building, the sort of place that is highly favoured for TV rehearsals. There is a sign on the door, \"TV Rehearsal Room.\" As PAUL draws near, a load of actors and extras, etc. are leaving, they are in costume, they are the ones who earlier had been going to a word rehearsal. When PAUL gets near the entrance he decides to go inside.\n\n72.\tINTERIOR  HALL\n\nPAUL enters and wanders about. He reaches a door, pushes it open and looks in. He sees a GIRL clad in period costume. She is moving around the room and obviously acting. PAUL watches her for a moment and then decides to go in.\n\n73.\tINTERIOR  REHEARSAL ROOM\n\nPAUL goes into the room. The GIRL is in mid-flight. She is very young and lovely and completely engrossed in what she is doing. The room is absolutely empty except for PAUL and herself. She is acting in the manner of an eighteenth-century coquette, or, to be precise, the voice English actresses use when they think they are being true to the costume period ... her youth however makes it all very charming.\n\nGIRL\nIf I believed you, sir, I might do those things and walk those ways only to find myself on Problem's Path. But I cannot believe you, and all those urgings serve only as a proof that you will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with me.\n\nShe dances lightly away from an imaginary lover and as she turns she sees PAUL who is as engrossed in the scene as she was.\n\nGIRL\n(surprised)\nOh!\n\nPAUL\n(enthusiastically)\nWell ... go 'head, do the next bit.\n\nGIRL\nGo away! You've spoilt it.\n\nPAUL\nOh, sorry I spoke.\n\nHe makes no attempt to go. He simply continues to look steadily at the girl; then he smiles at her. She is undecided what to do next.\n\nGIRL\nAre you supposed to be here?\n\nPAUL\nI've got you worried, haven't I?\n\nGIRL\nI'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.\n\nPAUL\nD'you know something, \"They\" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...\n\nGIRL\nYou're from Liverpool, aren't you?\n\nPAUL\n(ironically)\nHow'd you guess?\n\nGIRL\n(seriously)\nOh, it's the way you talk.\n\nPAUL\n(innocently)\nIs it ... is it, really?\n\nGIRL\n(suspiciously)\nAre you pulling my leg?\n\nPAUL\n(looking her straight in the eye)\nSomething like that.\n\nGIRL\n(unsure)\nI see.\n(airily)\nDo you like the play?\n\nPAUL\nYeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.\n(smiles to himself)\nYeah, it's gear on a girl.\n\nGIRL\nGear?\n\nPAUL\nAye, the big hammer, smashing!\n\nGIRL\nThank you.\n\nPAUL\nDon't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?\n\nGIRL pouts.\n\nPAUL\nYou don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...\n\nGIRL\n(cutting in)\nI'm not ...\n\nPAUL\nOh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?\n\nGIRL\nNo.\n(aggressively)\nI'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.\n\nPAUL\nOh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?\n\nGIRL\nYes.\n\nPAUL\nAye, I knew you were.\n\nGIRL\nWhat's that mean?\n\nPAUL\nWell, the way you were spouting, like ....\n(he imitates her)\n\"I don't believe you, sir...\" and all that. Yeah, it was gear.\n\nGIRL\n(dryly)\nThe big hammer?\n\nPAUL\n(smiling)\nOh aye, a sledge.\n\nGIRL\nBut the way you did it then sounded so phony.\n\nPAUL\nNo ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.\n\nHe moves and stands about like an actress.\n\nGIRL\nBut that's not like a real person at all.\n\nPAUL\nAye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?\n\nGIRL\nThey ought to be.\n\nPAUL\nOh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?\n\nGIRL\n(teasingly)\nWhat are you?\n\nPAUL\nI'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.\n\nGIRL\nI bet you don't sound like real people.\n\nPAUL\nWe do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.\n\nGIRL\nIs it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?\n\nPAUL\nWhat of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.\n\nHe laughs and with a gesture takes in the whole studio\n\nPAUL\n... all this and a jam butty too!!\n\nGIRL\nI only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.\n\nPAUL\nWhy? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?\n\nGIRL\nWhy selfish?\n\nPAUL\nWell, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.\n\nShe looks at him in surprise.\n\nPAUL\nNo, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, \"Go and give some to the other kids.\" So, I said I would but I thought to meself, \"She must think I'm soft.\" Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't nmind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?\n\nGIRL\nNot really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?\n\nPAUL\nWell, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?\n\nGIRL\nIs she?\n\nPAUL\nOf course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...\n(Paul starts acting a Liverpool girl, he minces about then turns, extending his leg)\nEh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!\n\nGIRL\n(shattered)\nAnd you honestly think that's what she meant?\n\nPAUL\nOh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.\n\nHe laughs.\n\nGIRL\nWell, it's nice to know you think we're clever.\n\nPAUL\n(grinning)\nAnd cunning.\n\nGIRL\nAnd what do you do about it?\n\nPAUL\nMe? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.\n\nGIRL\nPity.\n\nPAUL\n(not noticing the invitation)\nAye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.\n\nGIRL\nYes.\n\nPAUL\n(going)\nSee you.\n\nGIRL\nOf course.\n\nPAUL stands at the doorway, shrugs then goes out.\n74.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nIn the street, workmen are collecting shovels, drinking tea and doing all the things people do around building sites. RINGO mooches around. In the road is a hole with a diameter of about 3 feet, and at least 6 feet deep. RINGO looks down and a man is busily working at the bottom of the hole. He glares at RINGO. After a moment RINGO turns away. We now see a very elegant young lady coming towards RINGO. She is daintily avoiding a series of puddles. RINGO has an idea and does a Sir Walter Raleigh with his large Mac spreading it over one of the puddles. The girl walks across it smiling graciously. RINGO proceeds with the coat to the next puddle and to the next backing gradually towards the hole. At last he spreads the coat, without noticing what he is doing, over the hole. The girl steps onto the coat and disappears sharply. RINGO looks down the hole where the girl is held in the workman's arms. The workman rises out of the manhole until he is waist height. At this point an elegantly dressed gentleman appears (the girl's husband) he looks at his wife in the workman's arms and hits the workman. RINGO backs away through the puddles, and is nicked by the POLICEMAN.\n\n[Scenes 75 and 76 deleted in revision.]\n\n77.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  NEAR STAGE DOOR\n\nThe DIRECTOR is pacing up and down the corridor. NORM is also walking up and down, SHAKE is leaning against the wall quite unconcerned. NORM gives SHAKE a push.\n\nNORM\nWorry, will you!\n\nSHAKE adjusts his features to a worrying expression.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(bitterly)\nWell, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...\n\nNORM\nI'll murder that Lennon.\n\nDIRECTOR\nBut I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...\n\nSHAKE\n... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.\n\nNORM\nShurrup, cheerful.\n\nThe horrible prospect hits the DIRECTOR.\n\nDIRECTOR\nYou don't think...\n\nNORM\n(reassuring him)\nThey'll be here.\n\nDIRECTOR\nOh now, they can't do that to me.\n(turning on Norm)\nIt's all your fault.\n(overriding Norm)\nOh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the...\n\nSHAKE\n(helping out)\n... tea in China. Oh you're right, neither would I.\n\nHe steps away from NORM and stands near the DIRECTOR.\n\nNORM\nTraitor!\n\nSHAKE nods his agreement to this assessment of his character.\n\nSHAKE\nOf course.\n\nAt this moment JOHN, GEORGE and PAUL enter from the stage door. They are completely unconcerned and walk past the DIRECTOR, SHAKE and NORM.\n\nJOHN\n(as he passes by)\nHi Norm!\n\nNORM\n(preoccupied)\nHi, our lot!\n\nThe BOYS walk on when after a moment NORM snaps to.\n\nNORM\nOur lot!\n\nGEORGE\n(mildly)\nDid you want something.\n\nNORM\n(beaming with delight)\nI could eat the lot of you.\n\nJOHN\nYou'd look gear with an apple in your gob.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(accusingly)\nDo you realise you could have missed the final run-through?\n\nGEORGE\nSorry.\n\nSHAKE\nEh, there's only three of them.\n\nPAUL\nAye, we were looking for Ringo. But we realised he must have come back.\n\nDIRECTOR\nDo you realise we are on the air, live, in front of an audience, in forty-five minutes and you're one short.\n\nJOHN\nControl yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.\n\nNORM\nAye, let's try the dressing room.\n\nEveryone starts along the passage. NORM and PAUL last.\n\nPAUL\nEh, where's my grandfather?\n\nNORM\nDon't worry about him. He can look after himself.\n\nPAUL\nAye, I suppose so.\n\nThey run after the others.\n\n78.\tEXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  CLOSE-UP\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHere they are, personally signed and handwritten by your own sweet boys. The chance of a lifetime. Be the envy of your less fortunate sisters!\n\nThe CAMERA PULLS back and we see GRANDFATHER is surrounded by girls who have broken from the queue and are doing a brisk trade with the old man. He has a large sign on which is written: \"Get your genuine autographed Beatles photographs.\" On the edge of the crowd two POLICEMEN are trying to force the girls back into the queue. Finally they wade through the girls and confront GRANDFATHER. They look at the old man quizzically; he stares back coldly. They indicate he should hop it and quick but GRANDFATHER defiantly glares back at them. So with a sigh, they grab an arm each and escort the old man off.\n\n79.\tINTERIOR  POLICE STATION\n\nIt is the reception desk and behind it is the DESK SERGEANT. After a moment RINGO is dragged in by the POLICEMAN we saw him with before.\n\nRINGO\nLook, I'm Ringo Starr... I've got a show to do in a few minutes you've got to let me go... I'm Ringo...\n\nPOLICEMAN\nSure, they all say that these days ... Anyway ... I don't care who you are... you can save that for the stipendary. Here you are, Sarge.\n\nSERGEANT\nWhat is he?\n\nPOLICEMAN\n(reeling off the list)\nI've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.\n\nSERGEANT\nOh, a little savage, is he?\n\nPOLICEMAN\nA proper Aborigine.\n\nRINGO\n(on his dignity)\nI demand to see me solicitor.\n\nSERGEANT\nWhat's his name?\n\nRINGO\nOh, well if you're going to get technical --\n\nAt that moment there is a loud series of noises off camera, furious shouting and dull crashes of wood.\n\nSERGEANT\nHello, it's going to be one of those nights, is it?\n(to policeman)\nSit Charley Peace down over there.\n\nThe POLICEMAN takes RINGO to a bench and sits him down as GRANDFATHER and the two POLICEMEN who were with him enter. The sign is tattered and is being lugged after them.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWell, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.\n(kicks the nearest policeman)\nOh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.\n\nSERGEANT\nIs there a fire, then?\n\nGRANDFATHER leans across the desk and hisses at the SERGEANT.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYou ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.\n\nSERGEANT\nEh?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.\n\nSERGEANT\nWhat's he on about?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(squaring up)\nI'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.\n\nSERGEANT\n(to policemen)\nGet Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.\n\nThe POLICEMEN hurtle GRANDFATHER firmly but gently over to the bench on which RINGO is sitting and then return to the desk for a whispered conference with the SERGEANT. Meanwhile in full conspiratorial fashion GRANDFATHER talks to RINGO out of the side of his mouth.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nRingo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?\n\nRINGO\nWell I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nShush! Have they roughed you up yet?\n\nRINGO\nWhat?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(whispering)\nKeep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.\n\nRINGO\n(disturbed)\nHave they?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThat sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.\n\nRINGO\n(horrified)\nMe!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.\n\nRINGO\n(hopefully)\nOh, they seem all right to me.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThat's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.\n\nSERGEANT\n(calling)\nWould you two like a cup of tea?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYou see, sly villains.\n\nRINGO\n(miserable)\nNo thanks, Mr. Sergeant, sir.\n\nWe now have a CLOSE SHOT of POLICEMEN around the sergeant's desk.\n\nSERGEANT\nSo you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.\n\nPOLICEMAN\nYeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.\n\nSERGEANT\nWell, he can't stop here.\n\nShot of GRANDFATHER watching POLICEMEN intently and muttering words as he does.\n\nRINGO\nWhat are you doing?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nLip reading.\n\nRINGO\nWhat are they saying?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nNothing good.\n\nThe POLICEMEN make a move towards GRANDFATHER and RINGO.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWell son, it's now or never.\n\nHe jumps to his feet and scurries towards the door.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAll right, you paid assassins. Johnny McCartney'll give you a run for your threepence ha'penny.\n\nHe dashes out of the door followed by the POLICEMAN who has his pile of photos.\n\nSERGEANT\nNow, what's he up to?\n\nRINGO\nHe's allergic to Bobbies, especially English Bobbies.\n\nThe POLICEMAN with the photos returns.\n\nPOLICEMAN\n(Irish accent)\nYour man disappeared like a leveret over a hill.\n\nRINGO\nTurncoat!\n\nThe POLICEMEN turn on RINGO and walk towards him.\n\nCLOSE-UP  RINGO\n\nRINGO\nMother!\n\n80.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nGRANDFATHER is running at top speed down the street. He is breathing heavily and runs as if pursued by the hounds of hell. The street however is entirely empty and no one is even in sight. As he reaches the top of the street he pauses and turning, looks around him. From his P.O.V. we see just how empty the street is and heaving a sigh of relief GRANDFATHER cackles to himself. His triumph is short lived. At this precise moment down the street comes a parade of police vehicles, a Black Maria, an escorting police motor bike patrol and an ordinary squad car. The procession draws up and the street is full of policemen getting out of the Black Maria and squad car and off motor bikes.\n\nCLOSE-UP  GRANDFATHER's horrified face.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nBe God, they've called up reinforcements, the dragnet's out!\n\nHe dashes off wildly in the general direction of the theatre. He has been completely unnoticed by the policemen who are lining up for a last minute inspection by the inspector in charge. The inspector is like a commander-in-chief of a spear-head attack force.\n\nThey smartly march off in the direction taken by GRANDFATHER.\n\n81.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  CONTROL ROOM\n\nDIRECTOR\n(watching the clock)\nOnly half an hour and you're on!\n\nGEORGE\nCan I say something?\n\nThe director clutches at any straw.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(hopefully)\nYes, anything.\n\nGEORGE\n(earnestly)\nIt's highly unlikely we'll be on... I mean the law of averages are against you and it seems that, etc., etc....\n\nBut his speech is drowned by the pitiful moans of the DIRECTOR.\n\n82.\tEXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  STAGE DOOR\n\nThe four little boys from the canal are being driven away by the\nsecurity guard.\n\nGUARD\n(going back into theatre)\nI'll have the hides off of you lot.\n\nThe kids retreat as GRANDFATHER pants into shot, ignoring the kids he enters the stage door but in a second he is out again, grasped firmly by the collar by the security guard.\n\nGUARD\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go home!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI must see Pauly.\n\nGUARD\nGo home then and see him on the telly.\n\nThe GUARD re-enters the stage door.\n\nGRANDFATHER looks around him and sees the four kids. He hustles over and after a whispered conference we hear his offer.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nCan you fix him for me?\n\nBOYS\nYeah.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nSixpence.\n\nBOY\nEach?\n\nGRANDFATHER is about to argue.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nOh, all right.\n\nBOY\nAnd in advance.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(disgusted)\nMercenary!\n\nBut he hands over the money. The kids rush in the stage door and after a moment the furious GUARD chases them out and down the alley. GRANDFATHER, chuckling, nips in the door.\n\n83.\tINTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM  ON STAGE\n\nGRANDFATHER is being chased by several studio attendants; he is dodging behind equipment. He finally gets on a sound boom trolley and uses it as a weapon to keep his pursuers at bay.\n\n84.\tINTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM\n\nThe DIRECTOR, BOYS, and NORM and SHAKE see GRANDFATHER on the monitors. They dash out of the room and on to the stage.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(shouting)\nIt's all right, leave him alone.\n\nPAUL\nGrandad, where's Ringo?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThe police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.\n\nBOYS\nThe police station.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHe'll be pulp by now.\n\nJOHN\nWhat are we waiting for?\n\nGEORGE\nCome here.\n\nPAUL, JOHN and GEORGE rush off.\n\nCLOSE-UP DIRECTOR\n\nDIRECTOR\nWe've only got twenty minutes.\n\n85.\tEXTERIOR  STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION\n\nPAUL, JOHN and GEORGE come running down the street in single file, their knees  high in the air, they skid to a halt at the police station and without pausing they dash inside. After a moment they reappear -- only this time RINGO is behind them. They dash off down the street. They are followed at once by ten POLICEMEN also in single file. They are also pounding along knees high in the air. The BOYS and the coppers disappear around the corner. At once, they reappear from the other direction, then run down the street still followed by the policemen. When they reach the police station another group of police bars their way so they are forced to run up the stairs and inside.\n\n86.\tINTERIOR  POLICE STATION\n\nThe DESK SERGEANT is standing behind his desk looking very surprised. At this moment the boys run in and stand panting in front of the desk. Before the SERGEANT can start speaking the pursuing POLICEMEN arrive. They, too, are out of breath.\n\nSERGEANT\nWhat is all this?\n\nJOHN\n(heaving and panting)\nHold on until we get our breath.\n\nThe BOYS and POLICEMEN pant on until JOHN seems to have recovered.\n\nSERGEANT\nAll right now?\n\nJOHN\nSure.\n(to boys)\nReady?\n\nThe BOYS nod and without further ado they turn and run through the surprised rank of POLICEMEN and out into the street.\n\n87.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\nTHE CHASE CARRIES ON.\n\nShots of BOYS being pursued (still in single file) by police, including the sergeant with one shot where the BOYS are chasing the POLICEMEN. Finally, as they approach the theatre, they are seen by the girl fans who swarm around the police, over running them. The boys grin to each other and are about to make off when from their P.O.V. we see the INSPECTOR and POLICEMEN blocking it.\n\nJOHN\nAh well, it was worth a try.\n\nINSPECTOR\n(calling to Sergeant)\nWhat do you think you're up to?\n\nSERGEANT\nArrest those boys, sir.\n\nINSPECTOR\nThat's all we need to start a real riot!\n(to Boys)\nCome on lads, they're waiting for you.\n\n###\tINTERIOR  THEATRE BACKSTAGE\n\nThe Inspector now hustles the BOYS through the crowds and in through the main entrance of the theatre where SHAKE and NORM are waiting. NORM looks suspiciously at RINGO who is still wearing his cap. RINGO whips it off and NORM delightedly hugs him. The BOYS dash through the stalls entrance and on stage. The DIRECTOR sees them and bursts into tears with relief. NORM hustles the lads into the wings to be changed into their show costumes. All around them last-minute preparations are going on.\n\nDIRECTOR\nBoys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.\n\nNORM\nAren't you supposed to be in that box?\n\nThe DIRECTOR gives NORM a final glare and dashes off.\n\nPAUL\nAnd another thing, where's that old mixer?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHere, Pauly.\n\nAnd sitting on a box sadly chastened sits GRANDFATHER.\n\nPAUL\nWell, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.\n\nJOHN\nAw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.\n\nPAUL\n(hotly)\nWhat's old got to do with it?\n\nJOHN\nYou needn't bother.\n\nPAUL\nY'what?\n\nJOHN\nPractising to be thick-headed, you're there already.\n\nPAUL\nLook he's a mixer and a trouble maker!\n\nJOHN\nThat's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?\n\nFrom JOHN's P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER. He looks what he is, a tired old man.\n\nJOHN\nYou see.\n(to Grandad)\nYou know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(fighting back)\nBut I'm clean.\n\nThe BOYS giggle and slap him on the back.\n\n88.\tINTERIOR  TV THEATRE AUDITORIUM\n\nWe see the audience of girls streaming in and settling down in their places for the show. There is the usual business of getting the show ready and we see SHOTS of the girls' faces, then JOHN, PAUL, RINGO and GEORGE looking at them. At last on cue from the floor manager the BOYS start their act to the audience's screams. During the number we constantly CUT away to the audience with various SHOTS of the ecstatic girls. In the middle of these shots we see NORM standing at the side of the audience his face glowing with satisfaction. We follow his gaze and from NORM'S P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER handcuffed to SHAKE, but in spite of this, the old man is enjoying himself. The BOYS now perform a medley of numbers, i.e., a little of all the songs we have heard during the story. This gives the impression of a full set and we finish after their bows. While they are doing so they look again in the general direction of SHAKE and GRANDFATHER and from their P.O.V., we see SHAKE is beating time to the music but from his wrist dangles an empty set of handcuffs. GRANDFATHER has gone again. As the BOYS are reacting to GRANDFATHER's disappearance once again, the trap door on the stage opens and GRANDFATHER appears in the centre of the group as they finish their act and take their final bows.\n\n89.\tINTERIOR  STUDIO CORRIDOR\n\nNORM is waiting for the boys. With him are two studio attendants carrying the boys' luggage. As the BOYS excitedly appear he speaks to hem.\n\nNORM\nI've got the stuff. Come here.\n\nPAUL\nAren't we ...\n\nNORM\nNo, we're not!\n\nHe hurries them along.\n\nNORM\nThe office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.\n\nJOHN\nTonight? We can't make it ...\n\nNORM\nYou've got a midnight matinee.\n\nJOHN\nNow, look here, Norm ...\n\nNORM\nNo, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.\n\nJOHN\nWhat?\n\nNORM\nYou're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!\n\nNORM turns down a side exit where the door is open to the field. In it is an eight-passenger helicopter.\n\n90.\tEXTERIOR  STAGE DOOR  T.V. THEATRE\n\nThe BOYS and NORM come out of the building and start to run towards the helicopter.\n\nPAUL\n(looking behind him)\nWhere's my grandfather?\n\nNORM\n(arriving at helicopter door)\nDon't start. Look.\n\nThe boys look in the passenger bay and there is GRANDFATHER. He is still handcuffed to SHAKE but clutching his pile of photos.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(beckoning them in with his free hand which holds the photos)\nCome on, you're hanging up the parade.\n\nThe boys shout \"Get rid of those things, etc.\"\n\n91.\tEXTERIOR  FIELD\n\nThe final shot is of the helicopter rising up (SHOT FROM BELOW). As it disappears, a shower of photos come from its window.\n\nWe cut to a CLOSE-UP of one signed photo as it hits the ground and SUPER the closing credits over it.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/604651", "artist_names": "Le Zig Z\u00e9l\u00e9 (Ft.

the loneliness I feel tonight I hope you never know\nThe life that was a happy song has ended much too soon\nAnd I'm alone on our second honeymoon\nI look around the room and see you standing everywhere\nThe fragrance of your bridal flowers seems to fill the air\nThe blushing bride that gave me such a free and eager kiss\nTwo loving arms around me as you offered wedded bliss\nWe'd said that we'd return to live it over in this room\nBut I'm alone on our second honeymoonYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/494663", "artist_names":

From somewhere within the wind\ncomes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters\nsinging \"My Favorite Things.\" A series of sepia images of\nanti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after\nanother on the screen.\n\nIn the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title\nFEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:\nTITLE: \"He who makes a beast of himself Gets rid of the pain\nOf being a man.\"\nDr. Johnson\n\nThe VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe were somewhere around Barstow on\nthe edge of the desert when the\ndrugs began to take hold.\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nA red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black\nscreen.\n\nEXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nTHE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred\nmiles an hour.  THE STONES' \"Sympathy For the Devil\" blares.\n\nAT THE WHEEL\n\nSTRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,\nBEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.\nBESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND\nWRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY\nUNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.\n\nThe music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths\nup a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember saying something like:\n\"I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe\nyou should drive...\"\n\nGONZO starts shaving.\n\n2.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nSuddenly there was a terrible roar\nall around us and the sky was full\nof what looked like huge bats, all\nswooping and screeching and diving\naround the car...\n\nClose on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The\nreflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close\nto one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\n... and a voice was screaming: Holy\nJesus!  What are these goddamn\nanimals?\n\nCUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -\n\nDUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere.\nGONZO casually looks over...\n\nGONZO\nWhat are you yelling about?\n\nDUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench\nmakes GONZO nick his face with his razor.\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  It's your turn to drive.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNo point mentioning these bats.  I\nthought.  The poor bastard will see\nthem soon enough.\n\nDUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,\nfrantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A\nMOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles\nthrough the impressive stash.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had two bags of grass, seventy-\nfive pellets of mescaline, five\nsheets of high powered blotter\nacid, a salt shaker half full of\ncocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-\ncolored uppers, downers, screamers,\nlaughers... Also a quart of tequila,\na quart of rum, a case of beer, a\npint of raw ether and two dozen\namyls.\n\n3.\n\n\nDUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the\nSHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with\nanother six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives\nback into the car.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNot that we needed all that for the\ntrip, but once you get locked into\na serious drug collection, the\ntendency is to push it as far as\nyou can.\n\nTHE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,\nweakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A\nBAT?\n\nEXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nIN THE RED SHARK\n\nGONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a\nlousy driver.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe only thing that really worried\nme was the ether.  There is nothing\nin the world more helpless and\nirresponsible and depraved than a\nman in the depths of an ether binge.\nAnd I knew we'd get into that\nrotten stuff pretty soon.\n\nThe radio news wars with \"SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL\" on a tape\nrecorder.\n\nRADIO NEWS\nAn overdose of heroin was listed as\nthe official cause of death for\npretty 19 year old Diane Hanby\nwhose body was found stuffed in a\nrefrigerator last week...\n\nGONZO changes the station - \"ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET\nJESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE\" vies with \"SYMPATHY\"... He\nsings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.\nThe RED SHARK fishtails.\n\nGONZO\n\"One toke over the line, sweet\nJesus.\"\n\n4.\n\n\nDUKE\n(muttering to himself)\nOne toke.  You poor fool.  Wait\ntill you see those goddamn bats.\n\nUP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD\n\nA LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a\nthumb.  The RED SHARK roars past.  Then, fifty yards down\nthe road...\n\nGONZO\nLet's give that boy a lift.\n\nGONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side\nof the road.\n\nDUKE\nWe can't stop here - this is bat\ncountry!\n\nGONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.  The\nHITCHHIKER races to the car.  A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.\n\nHITCHHIKER\nHot damn!  I never rode in a\nconvertible before!\n\nThen the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the\nsight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-\nNORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.\n\nDUKE\nIs that right?  Well, I guess\nyou're about ready, eh?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER hesitates.\n\nGONZO\nWe're your friends.  We're not like\nthe others.\n\nDUKE\n(hissing sharply)\nNo more of that talk or I'll put\nthe leeches on you.\n\nDUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.\n\nEXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nThe HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED\nSHARK screams down the road.\n\n5.\n\n\nGONZO sings along to the tape player.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out\nand taking his chances.\n\nDUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear\nview mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHow long could we maintain, I\nwondered.  How long before one of\nus starts raving and jabbering at\nthis boy?  What will he think then?\nThis same lonely desert was the\nlast known home of the Manson family.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling\ndown GONZO's neck.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWould he make that grim connection\nwhen my attorney starts screaming\nabout bats and huge manta rays\ncoming down on the car?\n\nDUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with\nthe words, sometimes not.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIf so - well, we'll just have to\ncut his head off and bury him\nsomewhere.  Because it goes without\nsaying that we can't turn him loose.\nHe'd report us at once to some kind\nof outback Nazi law enforcement\nagency, and they'll run us down\nlike dogs...\n\nDUKE\n(out loud to himself)\nJesus!  Did I say that?\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOr just think it?  Was I talking?\nDid they hear me?\n\nGONZO\n(reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)\nIt's okay.  He's admiring the shape\nof your skull.\n\nDUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER\ngiggles nervously.\n\n6.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMaybe I better have a chat with\nthis boy I thought.  Perhaps if I\nexplain things, he'll rest easy...\n\nDUKE\n(roaring over the\nroad noise)\nTHERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD\nPROBABLY UNDERSTAND --\n\nThe HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.\n\nDUKE\n(yells)\nCAN YOU HEAR ME?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs\ninto the back seat.\n\nDUKE\nThat's good.  Because I want you to\nhave all the background.  This is a\nvery ominous assignment -- with\novertones of extreme personal\ndanger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism!\nThis is important, goddamnit!  This\nis a true story!...\n(WHACKS the BACK OF\nTHE DRIVER'S SEAT\nwith his fist)\n\n\nThe CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.\n\nGONZO\n(screams)\nKeep your hands off my fucking neck!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS\nHIM BACK DOWN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur vibrations were getting nasty --\nbut why?  Was there no communication\nin this car?  Had we deteriorated\nto the level of dumb beasts?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.\n\n7.\n\n\nDUKE\n(to HITCHHIKER)\nI want you to understand that this\nman at the wheel is my attorney!\nHe's not just some dingbat I found\non the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I\nthink he's probably Samoan.  But it\ndoesn't matter, does it?  Are you\nprejudiced?\n\nHITCHHIKER\nHell, no!\n\nDUKE\nI didn't think so.  Because in\nspite of his race, this man is\nextremely valuable to me.  Hell, I\nforgot all about this beer.  You\nwant one?\n(HITCHHIKER shakes\nhis head)\nHow about some ether?\n\nHITCHHIKER\nWhat?\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  Let's get right to the\nheart of this thing.  Twenty-four\nhours ago we were sitting in the\nPogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills\nHotel...\n\nINT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY\n\nA uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE\nthrough the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They\nare the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL\nBOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore\nSlings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED\nVERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\n... in the patio section, of\ncourse, drinking Singapore Slings\nwith mescal on the side, hiding\nfrom the brutish realities of this\nfoul year of Our Lord, 1971.\n\nThe DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and\nshades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank\ntop undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious\nconversation.\n\n8.\n\n\nDUKE\nI'm telling you, the Salazar story\nis getting too complicated.  The\nweasels have started closing in.\n\nThe DWARF sneers.\n\nDWARF\nPerhaps this is the call you've\nbeen waiting for all this time,\nsir...\n\nDUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...\n\nDUKE\nUh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...\n\nDUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A\nMOVIE SPY.\n\nDWARF\nThat was headquarters.  They want\nme to go to Las Vegas at once and\nmake contact with a Portuguese\nphotographer named Lacerda.  He'll\nhave the details.  All I have to do\nis check into my sound proof suite\nand he'll seek me out.\n\nGONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!\n\nGONZO\nGod hell!  I think I see the\npattern!  This one sounds like real\ntrouble!  You're going to need\nplenty of legal advice before this\nthing is over.  As your attorney I\nmust advise you that you'll need a\nvery fast car with no top and after\nthat, the cocaine.  And then the\ntape recorder, for special music,\nand some Acapulco shirts...\n(GONZO tucks his\nkhaki undershirt into\nhis white\nbellbottoms -- he\nmeans business!)\nThis blows my weekend, because\nnaturally I'll have to go with\nyou -- and we'll have to arm\nourselves.\n\n9.\n\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  If a thing's worth doing,\nit's worth doing right.\n\nDUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them\nwith the (very large) check in his hand.\n\nThey sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it\nswinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.\n\nDUKE\nI tell you, my man.  This is the\nAmerican Dream in action!  We'd be\nfools not to ride this strange\ntorpedo all the way to the end.\n\nGONZO\nIndeed.  We must do it.  What kind\nof story is this?\n\nEXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY\n\nDUKE and GONZO emerge.\n\nDUKE\nThe Mint 400!  The richest off-road\nrace for motorcycles and dune-\nbuggies in the history of organized\nsport!\n(handing parking\nticket to Valet)\n-- a fantastic spectacle in honor\nof some fatback grossero who owns\nthe luxurious Mint Hotel in the\nheart of downtown Vegas... at least\nthat's what the press release says.\n\nTheir car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.  They\njump in.\n\nDUKE\nWe're going to have to drum it up\non our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.\n\nAnd they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-\nbleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY\n\nThe PINTO races through shot.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nGetting hold of the drugs and\nshirts had been no problem...\n\n10.\n\n\nEXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY\n\nThe PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back\nwindow full of Hawaiian shirts.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\n... but the car and tape recorder\nwere not easy things to round up at\n6:30 on a Friday afternoon in\nHollywood.\n\nINT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY\n\nTORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile\nas GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE.  DUKE carries over four\nSingapore Slings.\n\nGONZO\nO.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it.\nWe'll be there in thirty minutes.\n(to DUKE -- hand over\nthe PHONE)\nI finally located a car with\nadequate horsepower and the proper\ncoloring.\n(into PHONE)\nWhat?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has\na major credit card!  Do you\nrealize who the fuck you're talking\nto?\n\nDUKE\nDon't take any guff from these\nswine.\n(GONZO slams the\nphone down)\nNow we need a sound store with the\nfinest equipment.  Nothing dinky.\nOne of those new Belgian Heliowatts\nwith a voice-activated shotgun\nmike, for picking up conversations\nin oncoming cars.\n\nGONZO\nWe won't make the nut unless we\nhave unlimited credit.\n\nDUKE\nWe will.  You Samoans are all the\nsame.  You have no faith in the\nessential decency of the white\nman's culture.\n\n11.\n\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK\n\nThe PINTO races down street.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe store was closed, but the\nsalesman said he would wait, if we\nhurried...\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK\n\nThey're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.  DUKE\nBANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut we were delayed en route when a\nStingray in front of us killed a\npedestrain.\n\nDirectly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered\ncorpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.\n\nEXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had trouble, again, at the car\nrental agency.\n\nBehind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with\nsatisfaction -- checking it out.  A nervous AGENT holds out\na clipboard.  DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.\n\nAGENT\nSay... uh... you fellas are going\nto be careful with this car, aren't\nyou?\n\nDUKE\nOf course.\n\nDUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the\ngas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.\n\nAGENT\nWell, good god!  You just backed\nover that two foot concrete abutment\nand you didn't even slow down!\nForty-five in reverse!  And you\nbarely missed the pump!\n\nDUKE\nNo harm done.  I always test the\ntransmission that way.  The rear\nend.  For stress factors.\n\n12.\n\n\nGONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box\nof rum and ice into the RED SHARK.\n\nAGENT\nSay.  Are you fellows drinking?\n\nDUKE\nNot me.  We're responsible people.\n\nHe JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.  The\nAGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.\n\nGONZO\nThere's another worrier.  He's\nprobably all cranked up on speed.\n\nEXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nSTRANGE AND MAGICAL.  In the moonlight: the silhouetted\nfigures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe spent the rest of that night\nrounding up materials and packing\nthe car.  Then we ate some mescaline\nand went swimming.\n\nThe surf crashes in the distance...\n\nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT\n\nDUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself\nfloat up through the silvery bubbles...\n\nDUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING\nMOONLIT SURF.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur trip was different.  It was to\nbe a classic affirmation of\neverything right and true in the\nnational character; a gross,\nphysical salute to the fantastic\npossibilities of life in this\ncountry.  But only for those with\ntrue grit...\n\nEXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nDUKE's intense face.\n\nDUKE\n...and we're chock full of that!\n\n13.\n\n\nGONZO\nDamn right!\n\nDUKE\nMy attorney understands this\nconcept, despite his racial handicap.\nBut do you?!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHe said he understood, but I could\nsee in his eyes that he didn't.  He\nwas lying to me.\n\nGONZO\nMy heart!\n\nGONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and\nscreeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel.\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\nWhere's the medicine?\n\nDUKE\nThe medicine?  Yes, it's right here.\n\nDUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.\n\nDUKE\nDon't worry, this man has a bad\nheart... Angina Pectoris.  But we\nhave a cure for it.\n\nDUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO\nfalls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The\nHITCHHIKER looks petrified.\n\nGONZO\n(suddenly flailing\nhis naked arms at the sky)\nTurn up the fucking music!  My\nheart feels like an alligator!\nVolume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must\nhave bass!  What's wrong with us?\nAre you goddamn old ladies?\n\nDUKE\n(turns up music to\nfull volume)\nYou scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch\nyour language!  You're talking to a\nDoctor of Journalism!\n\n14.\n\n\nGONZO\n(laughing uncontrollably)\nWhat the fuck are we doing out here?\nSomebody call the police!  We need\nhelp!\n\nDUKE\n(to HITCHHIKER)\nPay no attention to this swine.  He\ncan't handle the medicine.\n(he begins laughing)\n\n\nGONZO\n(to the HITCHHIKER)\nThe truth is we're going to Vegas\nto croak a scag baron named Savage\nHenry.  I've known him for years\nbut he ripped us off -- and you\nknow what that means, right?\n\nGONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\nSavage Henry has cashed his check!\nWe're going to rip his lungs out!\n\nDUKE\nAnd eat them!  That bastard won't\nget away with this!  What's going\non in this country when a scum\nsucker like that can get away with\nsandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?\n\nGONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID,\nAND FLEES.\n\nHITCHHIKER\nThanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot.\nI like you guys.  Don't worry about\nme.\n\nDUKE\n(yells)\nWait a minute!  Come back and have\na beer!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER RUNS from car.\n\n15.\n\n\nGONZO\nGood riddance.  That boy made me\nnervous.  Did you see his eyes?\n(laughing)\nJesus, this is good medicine.\n\nDUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER.\n\nDUKE\n(suddenly clambering\ninto the front seat)\nMove over!!  We have to get out of\nCalifornia before that kid finds a\ncop!\n\nDUKE GUNS THE RED SHARK -- TAKES OFF DOWN THE ROAD...\n\nEXT. UNBELIEVABLY FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nTHE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead\ndriving.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt was absolutely imperative that\nwe get to the Mint Hotel before the\ndeadline for press registration.\nOtherwise, we might have to pay for\nour suite.\n\nGONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.  The top comes off\nand the powder swirls away on the wind.\n\nGONZO\nOh, Jesus!  Did you see what god\njust did to us?\n\nDUKE\nGod didn't do that!  You did it!\nYou're a fucking narcotics agent,\nthat was our cocaine, you pig!\n\nGONZO\n(waving his .357\nMagnum at Duke)\nYou better be careful.  Plenty of\nvultures out here.  They'll pick\nyour bones clean before morning.\n\nDUKE\nYou whore!\n\nGONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID.\n\n16.\n\n\nGONZO\nHere -- chew this.  It's your half\nof the acid.\n\nDUKE takes his half -- chews it.\n\nDUKE\nHow long do I have?\n\nGONZO\nMaybe thirty more minutes.  As your\nattorney, I advise you to drive at\ntop speed.  It'll be a goddamn\nmiracle if we can get there before\nyou turn into a wild animal.  Are\nyou ready for that?  Checking into\na Vegas hotel under a phony name\nwith intent to commit capital fraud\nand a head full of acid.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThirty minutes.  It was going to be\nvery close.\n\nThe RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard:\n\"DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \\ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20\nYEARS; SALE - LIFE!!\"\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL - DUSK\n\nThe RED SHARK pulls up outside the MINT.  A great banner\nspanning the street announces the MINT 400.\n\nDUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him.  Clutching a\nbuckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the\nTICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.\n\nDUKE\nI need this, right?\n\nATTENDANT\nI'll remember your face.\n\nDUKE stares -- losing it...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere is no way of explaining the\nterror I felt.\n\nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\nDUKE waits in line at the front desk -- RIGID WITH PENT UP\nENERGY.  GONZO's ahead of him -- muscling in -- trying to\nqueue jump and failing.\n\n17.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI was pouring sweat.  My blood is\ntoo thick for Nevada.  I've never\nbeen able to properly explain\nmyself in this climate.\n\nA COUPLE move off and DUKE jerks forward -- stops -- eyes\nfixed on the stony FEMALE RESERVATIONS CLERK.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\nBe quiet, be calm... name, rank,\nand press affiliation, nothing\nelse...\n\nDUKE moves ANOTHER RIGID STEP CLOSER to the desk -- the\ntension almost snapping him in two.  GONZO's FLAPPING\nAROUND -- absolutely no success.\n\nSomething catches DUKE's eye... He REMAINS ROOTED -- his\neyes turning to the VEGETAL PAISLEY PATTERNS ON THE CARPET\nWHICH ARE SHIFTING -- UNDULATING.  THE CARPET PATTERNS ARE\nINEXORABLY CREEPING UP THE WALLS...\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\n...ignore this terrible drug,\npretend it's not happening...\n\nThe LAST PEOPLE leave -- with A FINAL, STIFF MOVE, DUKE\ncomes face to face with the RESERVATIONS CLERK... AND\nEXPLODES!\n\nDUKE\nHI THERE.  MY NAME... AH, RAOUL\nDUKE... ON... ON THAT LIST, THAT'S\nFOR SURE.  FREE LUNCH, FINAL\nWISDOM, TOTAL COVERAGE... WHY NOT?\nI HAVE MY ATTORNEY WITH ME, AND I\nREALIZE OF COURSE...\n\nAs DUKE stares at her, BABBLING, her FACE BEGINS TO MORPH.\nHe tries to stop it happening by TALKING FASTER.\n\nDUKE\n... THAT HIS NAME IS NOT ON THE\nLIST, BUT WE MUST HAVE THAT SUITE.\nYES.  JUST CHECK THE LIST AND\nYOU'LL SEE.  DON'T WORRY.  WHAT'S\nTHE SCORE HERE?  WHAT'S NEXT?\n\nDUKE sags -- grips the desk -- WHITE KNUCKLES.\n\n18.\n\n\nRESERVATIONS CLERK\n(hands him an envelope)\nYour suite's not ready yet.  But\nthere's somebody looking for you.\n\nHer face is CHANGING -- SWELLING -- PULSING...\n\nDUKE\n(shouts)\nNO!  WHY?  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING\nYET!\n\nThe FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN & GROWS FANGS.\nDEADLY POISON!  DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm\nintensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE.\n\nGONZO\nI can handle this.  This man has a\nbad heart, but I have plenty of\nmedicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo.\nPrepare our suite at once.  We'll\nbe in the bar.\n\nGONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.  DUKE looks\nback -- the RESERVATIONS CLERKS is now a MORAY EEL -- green\njowls and fangs.\n\nINT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY\n\nThe bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme.\nDUKE and GONZO at the bar, a marlin spike hanging on the\nwall behind them.  DUKE has turned to stone...\n\nGONZO\n(to the bartender)\nTwo Cuba Libres with beer and\nmescal on the side.\n(opens the envelope)\nWho's Lacerda, he's waiting for us\nin a room on the twelfth floor?\n\nDUKE\nLacerda?\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI couldn't remember.  The name rang\na bell, but I couldn't concentrate.\nTerrible things were happening all\naround us...\n\nDUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED.  BLOOD FLOWS FREELY\nonto the floor.  DUKE keeps his voice low.\n\n19.\n\n\nDUKE\nOrder some golf shoes.  Otherwise,\nwe'll never get out of this place\nalive.  It's impossible to walk in\nthis muck -- no footing at all...\n\nDUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared.\n\nDUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED\ninto a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND\nGNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI was right in the middle of a\nfucking reptile zoo.  And somebody\nwas giving booze to these goddamn\nthings!  It won't be long before\nthey tear us to shreds!\n\nGONZO IS SUDDENLY BACK -- AT DUKE'S SHOULDER.\n\nGONZO\nIf you think we're in trouble now\nwait until you see what's happening\nin the elevators.\n\nGONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying...\nas he speaks he seems to be floating.  Duke struggles to\nkeep him in his line of vision.\n\nGONZO\nI just went upstairs to see this\nman Lacerda.  I told him I knew\nwhat he was up to...\n(GONZO rallies --\nturns fierce)\nHe says he's a photographer!  But\nwhen I mentioned Savage Henry he\nfreaked!  He knows we're onto him!\n\nDUKE\nBut what about our room?  And the\ngolf shoes?\n\nA GROUP OF REPTILES AT A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM stares at\nthem, BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THEIR FANGS.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\n(grabbing GONZO\ntrying to hold him still)\nHoly shit!  Look at that bunch over\nthere!  They've spotted us!\n\n20.\n\n\nCut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing\nnext to him at the bar.  The room has returned to normality.\nGONZO is sitting in his original position.\n\nGONZO\n(downs his drink --\ngets up)\nThat's the press table.  Where you\nhave to sign in for our credentials.\nShit, let's get it over with.  You\nhandle that, and I'll check on the\nroom.\n\nDUKE\nNo, no.  Don't leave me!\n\nBlack screen.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK\n\nA TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST MONK,\nprotesting the war, sets himself on fire.  A very nervous\nBELL BOY is laying out GONZO's order.  A marlin spike is on\nthe floor next to DUKE.\n\nBELL BOY\nFour club sandwiches, four shrimp\ncocktails.\n\nDUKE\nThere's a big... machine in the\nsky... some kind of electric snake...\n\nDUKE is curled by the window -- MESMERIZED by an unseen neon\nsign outside the window.  His eyes fill with a million\ncolored lights.\n\nBELL BOY\n... a quart of rum...\n\nDUKE\n... coming straight at us.\n\nGONZO\nShoot it.\n\nDUKE\nNot yet.  I want to study its habits.\n\nBELL BOY\n... and nine fresh grapefruit.\n\n21.\n\n\nGONZO\nVitamin C.  We'll need all we can\nget.\n\nGONZO sees the BELL BOY out the door -- turns and lays into\nDUKE.\n\nGONZO\nLook, you've got to stop this talk\nabout snakes and leeches and\nlizards and that stuff.  It's\nmaking me sick!\n\nDUKE stares -- hears the drone of B52 BOMBERS...\n\nOn TV: The LAOS INVASION -- A SERIES OF HORRIFYING\nDISASTERS -- EXPLOSIONS AND TWISTED WRECKAGE.\n\nNewsreel footage of MAI LAI MASSACRE and the LIEUTENANT\nCALLEY court-martial.\n\nDUKE\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nGONZO\nYou bastard!  They'll never let us\nback in that place.  I leave you\nalone for three minutes and you\nstart waving that goddamn marlin\nspike around -- yelling about\nreptiles!  You scared the shit out\nof those people!  They were ready\nto call the cops.  Hell, the only\nreason they gave us press passes\nwas to get you out of there...\n\nA knock at the door.  DUKE and GONZO break out in a sweat.\n\nDUKE\nOh my God!  Who's that?!\n\nGONZO STICKS HIS GUN IN HIS WAISTBAND -- opens the door to\nLACERDA -- BOUNCING WITH PUPPY DOG ENTHUSIASM.  GONZO stares\nat a man he instantly hates -- watches him with deep\nsuspicion.\n\nLACERDA\nDuke?  I'm Lacerda your photographer.\nGot your press passes?  Good, good.\nToo bad you missed the bikes\nchecking in.  My, what a sight!\n\nDUKE watches the B-52S DROP THEIR BOMB LOADS.\n\n22.\n\n\nLooking down to the thick, patterned carpet, DUKE sees the\nBOMBS EXPLODE like vicious flowers.\n\nDUKE looks up: LACERDA is a war photographer -- bruised,\nfilthy and blood spattered.  LACERDA approaches him --\ntalking a foreign language.\n\nLACERDA\nHusquavarnas.  Yamahas.  Kawaskis.\nMaicos.  Pursang.  Swedish Fireballs.\nCouple of Triumphs, here and there\na CZ.  All very fast.  What a race\nit's gonna be.\n\nDUKE screws up his eyes -- WILLS NORMALITY BACK.  LACERDA is\nnow just a keen photographer.L\n\nLACERDA\nWell, we start at dawn.  Get a good\nnight's sleep.  I know I will.\n\nAnd with a cheerful wave, he's gone.  DUKE is in shock.\n\nDUKE\n(weakly)\nThat's good...\n\nGONZO\nI think he's lying to us.  I could\nsee it in his eyes.\n\nDUKE\n(even weaker)\nThey'll probably have a big net for\nus when we show up.\n\nDUKE's attention returns to the devastation on the TV...\n\nGONZO\nTurn that shit off!\n\nGONZO kills the TV.\n\nBlack screen.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNever lose sight of the primary\nresponsibility.  Cover the story.\nBut what was the story?  Nobody had\nbothered to say.\n\n23.\n\n\nEXT. DESERT - DAWN\n\nAgainst A BIG ORANGE SUN, on a concrete slab, MEN FIRE\nSHOTGUNS into the dawn sky.

Did\nyou put him on to her?\n\nDUKE\n(backing slowly\ntowards the door)\nLook you better put that blade away\nand get your head straight.  I have\nto put the car in the lot.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOne of the things you learn, after\nyears of dealing with drug people,\nis that you can turn your back on a\nperson, but never turn your back on\na drug.  Especially when it's\nwaving a razor-sharp hunting knife\nin your eyes.\n\nINT. CASINO/LOBBY MINT HOTEL\n\nThe MAGAZINE REPORTER is on the telephone.\n\nMAGAZINE REPORTER\nLas Vegas at dawn.  The racers are\nstill asleep, the dust is still on\nthe desert, fifty thousand dollars\nin prize money, slumbers darkly in\nthe office safe at Del Webb's\nfabulous Mint Hotel...\n\nDUKE walks past the REPORTER -- into THE CASINO, THE SAD,\nMEAGRE CROWDS AROUND THE CRAP TABLES.  No joy.  DUKE watches.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWho are these people?  These faces!\nWhere do they come from?  They look\nlike caricatures of used car\ndealers from Dallas.\n(MORE)\n\n44.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O; CONT'D)\nAnd, sweet Jesus, there are a hell\nof a lot of them at four-thirty on\na Monday morning.  Still humping\nthe American dream, that vision of\nthe big winner somehow emerging\nfrom the last minute predawn chaos\nof a stale Vegas casino.\n\nDUKE stops at the Money Wheel, puts down a two dollar bill\non a number, the wheel turns, he loses.\n\nDUKE\nYou bastards!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNo.  Calm down.  Learn to ENJOY\nlosing.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE walks back into the room.  We hear the LOUD STRAINS OF\nTHREE DOG NIGHT'S \"JOY TO THE WORLD.\"\n\nHe walks to the bathroom and opens the door.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nSubmerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub.\nSoap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface.  A\nlarge empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor.  The\nshower is on -- the tub overflowing.  THE TAPE RECORDER\nPLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over\nthe sink.\n\nDUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED\nUP WHITE BLOTTER.\n\nDUKE\nYou ate ALL THIS ACID?\n\nNo answer.\n\nDUKE\n(turning down the volume)\nYou evil son of a bitch.  You\nbetter hope there's some Thorazine\nin that bag, because if there's\nnot, you're in bad trouble.\n\nGONZO\nMusic!  Turn it up.  Put that tape\non.\n\n45.\n\n\nDUKE\nWhat tape?\n\nGONZO\nJefferson Airplane. \"White Rabbit.\"\nI want a rising sound.\n\nDUKE\nYou're doomed.  I'm leaving here in\ntwo hours and then they're going to\ncome up here and beat the mortal\nshit out of you with big saps.\nRight there in that tub.\n\nGONZO\nI dig my own graves.  Green water\nand the White Rabbit.  Put it on.\n\nDUKE\nOK.  But do me one last favor, will\nyou.  Can you give me two hours?\nThat's all I ask -- just two hours\nto sleep before tomorrow.  I\nsuspect it's going to be a very\ndifficult day.\n\nHe switches on the tape. \"WHITE RABBIT\" begins to build.\n\nGONZO\n(coolly)\nOf course, I'm your attorney, I'll\ngive you all the time you need, at\nmy normal rates: $45 an hour -- but\nyou'll be wanting a cushion, so,\nwhy don't you just lay one of those\n$100 bills down there beside the\nradio, and fuck off?\n\nDUKE\nHow about a check?\n\nGONZO\nWhatever's right.\n\nDUKE moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and\nleaves, closing the door behind him.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE goes across to the sofa and crashes -- exhausted.\nSuddenly a great ripping and crashing noise in the bathroom.\n\nGONZO (V/O)\nHelp!  You bastard!  I need help!\n\n46.\n\n\nDUKE JUMPS up -- crosses to the bathroom door, muttering.\n\nDUKE\nShit, he's killing himself!\n\nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nDUKE RUSHES IN.  GONZO flails -- trying to reach the radio\nwith the shower curtain pole which he has ripped from its\nmounts.\n\nGONZO\n(snarling)\nI want that fucking radio!\n\nDUKE GRABS THE RADIO.\n\nDUKE\nDon't touch it!  Get back in that\ntub!\n\nGONZO\nBack the tape up.  I need it again!\nLet it roll!  Just as high as the\nfucker can go!  And when it comes\nto that fantastic note where the\nrabbit bites its own head off, I\nwant you to THROW THAT FUCKING\nRADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME!\n\nDUKE stares down at GONZO.\n\nDUKE\nNot me.  It would blast you through\nthe wall -- stone dead in ten\nseconds and they'd make me explain\nit!\n\nGONZO\nBULLSHIT!  Don't make me use this.\n\nHIS ARM LASHES OUT OF THE WATER, HOLDING THE KNIFE.\n\nDUKE\nJesus.\n\nGONZO\nDo it!  I want to get HIGHER!\n\nDUKE considers this.  He's had enough.\n\n47.\n\n\nDUKE\nOkay.  You're right.  This is\nprobably the only solution.\n(holds the PLUGGED IN\nTAPE/RADIO over the tub)\nLet me make sure I have it all\nlined up.  You want me to throw\nthis thing into the tub when \"WHITE\nRABBIT\" peaks.  Is that it?\n\nGONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.\n\nGONZO\nFuck yes.  I was beginning to think\nI was going to have to go out and\nget one of the goddamn maids to do\nit.\n\nDUKE\nAre you ready?\n\nHe switches \"WHITE RABBIT\" back on.  GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS\nAND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.\n\nMeanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a\ngood two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when \"WHITE\nRABBIT\" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.\n\nGONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A\nTIDAL WAVE.\n\nDUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF\nTHE BATHROOM.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE slumps onto the sofa.\n\nSILENCE.\n\nGONZO RIPS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR, his eyes unfocused.  HE\nWAVES THE RAZOR SHARP BLADE out in front of him -- LUNGES at\nDUKE.  DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE.\n\nDUKE\nMACE!  YOU WANT THIS?\n\nGONZO stops -- hisses.\n\nGONZO\nYou bastard!  You'd do that,\nwouldn't you?\n\n48.\n\n\nDUKE\n(laughs)\nWhy worry?  You'll like it.  Nothing\nin the world like a Mace high.\nForty-five minutes on your knees\nwith the dry heaves...\n\nGONZO\nYou cheap honky sonofabitch...\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  Hell, just a minute ago,\nyou were asking me to kill you!\nAnd now you want to kill me!  What\nI should do, goddamnit, is call the\npolice!\n\nGONZO\nThe cops?\n\nDUKE\nThere's no choice.  I wouldn't dare\ngo to sleep with you wandering\naround with a head full of acid and\nwanting to slice me up with that\ngoddamn knife!\n\nGONZO\n(mumbles)\nWho said anything about slicing you\nup?  I just wanted to carve a\nlittle Z on your forehead.  Nothing\nserious.\n\nGONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.\n\nDUKE\n(menaces him with the MACE)\nGet back in that tub.  Eat some\nreds and try to calm down.  Smoke\nsome grass, shoot some smack --\nshit, do whatever you have to do,\nbut let me get some rest.\n\nGONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.\n\nGONZO\nHell, yes.  You really need some\nsleep.  You have to work.  Goddamn.\nWhat a bummer.  Try to rest.  Don't\nlet me keep you up.\n\n49.\n\n\nGONZO shuffles back into the bathroom.  DUKE wedges a chair\nup against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next\nto the clock.\n\nDUKE turns on the TV.  WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  He\ncollapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIgnore the nightmare in the bathroom.\nJust another ugly refugee from the\nLove Generation.\n\nThe WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his\nface.  The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL\nBEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy attorney had never been able to\naccept the notion -- often espoused\nby former drug abusers -- that you\ncan get a lot higher without drugs\nthan with them.  And neither have\nI, for that matter.\n\nThe pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL\nLIGHTSHOW PATTERN.  With DUKE still sitting in the\nforeground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior\nof A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.\n\nINT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT\n\nA slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng.  All the\naction is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI recall one night in the Matrix.\nThere I was -- a victim of the Drug\nExplosion.  A natural street freak,\njust eating whatever came by.\n\nA ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting.  The\nsound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.\n\nROAD-PERSON\nAnybody want some L...S...D...?  I\ngot all the makin's right here.\nAll I need is a place to cook.\n\nThe camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth.\n\nINT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT\n\nStill in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a\nHUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty.\n\n50.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI decided to eat only half at first.\nGood thinking.  But I spilled the\nrest on the sleeve of my red\nPendleton shirt.\n\nDUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the\ndoor to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in\nslow-motion.\n\nMUSICIAN\nWhat's the trouble?\n\nDUKE\n(also in slow-motion)\nWell, all this white stuff on my\nsleeve is LSD.\n\nThe MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A\nlong pause.\n\nCut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-\ncut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.\nWe cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the\nmen's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...\nsucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The\nSTOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWith a bit of luck his life was\nruined -- forever thinking that\njust behind some narrow door in all\nhis favorite bars, men in red\nPendleton shirts are getting\nincredible kicks from things he'll\nnever know.\n\nINT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT\n\nThe STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking\nlost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a\nTV white noise snowstorm.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE sits staring at the TV.\n\n51.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nStrange memories on this nervous\nnight in Las Vegas.\n(he gets up, pours\nhimself a drink)\nHas it been five years?  Six?  It\nseems like a lifetime -- the kind\nof peak that never comes again.\nSan Francisco in the middle sixties\nwas a very special time and place\nto be a part of.  But no\nexplanation, no mix of words or\nmusic or memories can touch that\nsense of knowing that you were\nthere and alive in that corner of\ntime and the world.  Whatever it\nmeant.\n\nDUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in.\n\nEXT. 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE\n\nWe are in SAN FRANCISCO.  IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nTHERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION,\nAT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE\nSPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A\nFANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT\nWHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,\nTHAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I\nTHINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE\nOF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE\nFORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY\nMEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T\nNEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY\nprevail.  We had all the momentum;\nwe were riding the crest of a high\nand beautiful wave...\n\nDUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE\nNEVER SEEN BEFORE.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nSo now, less than five years later,\nyou can go up on a steep hill in\nLas Vegas and look west, and with\nthe right kind of eyes you can\nalmost see the high water mark --\nthat place where the wave finally\nbroke and rolled back.\n\n52.\n\n\nThe memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.\nSuddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi\nshouting \"WOODSTOCK \u00dcBER ALLES!\"\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN\n\nA harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking\nlike shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe decision to flee came suddenly.\nOr maybe not.\n\nDUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of\nfruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.\n\nBELL BOY\nRoom service!\n\nThe BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already\nstacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMaybe I'd planned it all along --\nsubconsciously waiting for the\nright moment.  The bill was a\nfactor, I think.  Because I had no\nmoney to pay for it.\n\nDUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur room service tabs had been\nrunning somewhere between $29 and\n$36 per hour, for forty-eight\nconsecutive hours.  Incredible.\nHow could it happen?\n\nDUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED\nLUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room --\nempty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut by the time I asked this\nquestion, there was no one around\nto answer.\n\nDUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.\n\n53.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy attorney was gone.  He must have\nsensed trouble.\n\nQUICK CUT TO:\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY\n\nGONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of\nbrand-new fine cowhide luggage.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nPanic.\n\nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase --\nleaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both\nways, then hurries away down the corridor.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt crept up my spine like first\nrising vibes of an acid frenzy.\nAll these horrible realities began\nto dawn on me.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY\n\nAn anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the\nelevator descends.  He searches his pockets...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHere I was, alone in Las Vegas,\nwith this goddamned incredibly\nexpensive car, completely twisted\non drugs, no cash, no story for the\nmagazine.  And on top of everything\nelse I had a gigantic goddamn hotel\nbill to deal with.\n\nDUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.\n\nThe door opens.  A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN\nHANDCUFFS.\n\nDUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner.  Doors\nclose.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI didn't even know who had won the\nrace.  Maybe nobody.\n\n54.\n\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\nDUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering\nMANAGER.  Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.\n\nDUKE\n(muttering to himself)\nHow would Horatio Alger have\nhandled this situation?\n\nEXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY\n\nMotoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN\nwith a smile.  The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves\nat the CAR BOY.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nStay calm.  Stay calm.  I'm a\nrelatively respectable citizen -- a\nmultiple felon, perhaps, but\ncertainly not dangerous.\n\nThe CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.  DUKE jumps in.  The\nback seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint\n400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\nLuckily, I had taken the soap and\ngrapefruit and other luggage out to\nthe car a few hours earlier.  Now\nit was only a matter of slipping\nthe noose...\n\nDUKE shifts into drive.  Deliverance!\n\nCLERK'S VOICE\nMR. DUKE!\n\nDUKE freezes.\n\nCLERK'S VOICE\nMr. Duke!  We've been looking for\nyou!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe game was up!  They had me.\n\nDUKE\n(to himself)\nWell, why not?  Many fine books\nhave been written in prison.\n\n55.\n\n\nResigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.  A young CLERK\narrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS\nHAND.\n\nCLERK\nSir?\n(thrusts out a TELEGRAM)\nThis telegram came for you.\nActually, it isn't for you.  It's\nfor somebody named Thompson, but it\nsays 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does\nthat make sense?\n\nDUKE\n(barely able to speak)\nYes... It makes sense.\n\nDUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.\n\nThe CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous\nstash inside.\n\nCLERK\nI checked the register for this man\nThompson.  We don't show him but I\nfigured he might be part of your\nteam.\n\nDUKE\nHe is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to\nhim.\n\nHe fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.\n\nSECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word\nor two.\n\nCLERK\nWhat confused us was Dr. Gonzo's\nsignature on the telegram from Los\nAngeles.  When we knew he was right\nhere in the hotel.\n\nDUKE\nYou did the right thing.  Never try\nto understand a press message.\nAbout half the time we use codes --\nespecially with Dr. Gonzo.\n\nCLERK\nTell me.  When will the doctor be\nawake?\n\n56.\n\n\nDUKE\n(tenses)\nAwake?  What do you mean?\n\nDUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.\n\nCLERK\n(uncomfortably)\nWell... the manager, Mr. Heem,\nwould like to meet him.  Nothing\nunusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet\nall our large accounts... put them\non a personal basis... just a chat\nand a handshake, you understand.\n\nDUKE\nOf course.  But if I were you, I'd\nleave the Doctor alone until after\nhe's eaten breakfast.  He's a very\ncrude man.\n\nDUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.\n\nCLERK\nBut he will be available?  Perhaps\nlater this morning?\n\nDUKE\nLook.  That telegram was all\nscrambled.  It was actually from\nThompson, not to him.  Western\nUnion must have gotten the names\nreversed.  I have to get going.  I\nhave to get out to the track.\n\nCLERK\nThere's no hurry!  The race is over!\n\nDUKE\n(taking off)\nNot for me.\n\nHe waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.\n\nCLERK\nLet's have lunch!\n\nDUKE\nRighto!\n\nEXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY\n\nDUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.\n\n57.\n\n\nA \"YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS\" sign flashes past.\n\nBob Dylan plays: \"Memphis Blues Again -- \"Aaww, Mama, can\nthis really by the end...?\"\n\nA sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nJesus, bad waves of paranoia,\nmadness, fear and loathing --\nintolerable vibrations in this\nplace.  Get out!  The weasels were\nclosing in.  I could smell the ugly\nbrutes.  Flee!\n\nDUKE drives fast.\n\nDUKE\nDo me one last favor Lord: just\ngive me five more high-speed hours\nbefore you bring the hammer down;\njust let me get rid of this goddamn\ncar and off of this horrible desert.\n\nA sign flashes \"YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.\"\n\nA patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nYou evil bastard!  This is your\nwork!  You'd better take care of\nme, Lord... because if you don't\nyou're going to have me on your\nhands.\n\nThe patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nFew people understand the psychology\nof dealing with a Highway Traffic\nCop.  Your normal speeder will\npanic and immediately pull over to\nthe side.  This is wrong.\n\nDUKE floors the gas pedal.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt arouses contempt in the cop heart.\n\nTHE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.\n\n58.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMake the bastard chase you.  He\nwill follow.  But he won't know\nwhat to make of your blinker signal\nthat says you're about to turn right.\n\nDUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThis is to let him know you're\nlooking for a proper place to pull\noff and talk.\n\nAN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.\n\nDUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt will take him a moment to\nrealize that he is about to make\n180 degree turn at speed... but you\nwill be ready for it, braced for\nthe G's and the fast heel toe work.\n\nThe patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.\n\nEXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY\n\nThe patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE\nstands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nJust what the FUCK did you think\nyou were doing?!\n\nDUKE smiles.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nMay I see your license.\n\nDUKE\nOf course, officer.\n\nDUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer\ncan -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI knew I was fucked.\n\nThe COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for\nDUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.\n\n59.\n\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nCould I have that, please?\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  It was getting warm anyway.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --\nglances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars\nof soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nYou realize...\n\nDUKE\nYeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I\nunderstand that.  I knew it was a\ncrime but I did it anyway.  Shit,\nwhy argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nThat's a strange attitude.\n\nHe looks at DUKE thoughtfully.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nYou know -- I get the feeling you\ncould use a nap.  There's a rest\narea up ahead.  Why don't you pull\nover and sleep a few hours?\n\nDUKE\nA nap won't help.  I've been awake\nfor too long -- three or four\nnights.  I can't even remember.  If\nI go to sleep now, I'm dead for\ntwenty hours.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nOkay.  Here's how it is.  What goes\ninto my book, as of noon, is that I\napprehended you... for driving too\nfast, and advised you to proceed no\nfurther than the next rest area...\nyour stated destination, right?\nWhere you plan to take a long nap.\nDo I make myself clear?\n\nDUKE\nHow far is Baker?  I was hoping to\nstop there for lunch.\n\n60.\n\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nNot my jurisdiction.  The city\nlimits are two point two miles\nbeyond the rest area.  Can you make\nit that far?\n\nDUKE\nI'll try.  I've been wanting to go\nto Baker for a long time.  I've\nheard a lot about it.\n\nThe PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nExcellent seafood.  With a mind\nlike yours, you'll probably want to\ntry the land-crab.  Try the Majestic\nDiner.\n\nThe PATROLMAN slams the door shut.\n\nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY\n\nDUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI felt raped.  The Pig had done me\non all fronts, and now he was going\noff to chuckle about it -- on the\nwest side of town, waiting for me\nto make a run for L.A.\n\nDUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he\nsignals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn\nhe sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn\ntheir eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER\ndrops his thumb.\n\nDUKE\nGreat Jesus, it's him.\n\nDUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE\nWAY HE CAME.\n\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.\n\nDUKE\nThey've nailed me!  I'm trapped in\nsome stinking desert crossroads\ncalled Baker.  I don't have much\ntime.  The fuckers are closing in.\nThey'll hunt me down like a beast!\n\n61.\n\n\nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nGONZO sits surrounded by legal papers and law books.

What the\nhell are you doing out there in the\nmiddle of the fucking desert?\n\n62.\n\n\nDUKE stares at the telegram.\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  It's all a big joke.\nI'm actually sitting beside the\npool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking\nfrom a portable phone.  Some dwarf\nbrought it out from the casino.  I\nhave total credit!  Can you grasp\nthat?\n(shouts)\nDon't come anywhere near this place!\nForeigners aren't welcome here!\n\nDUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone.\n\nEXT. DESERT - DAY\n\nC/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWell.  This is how the world works.\n\nC/U An IGUANA basks in the sun.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nAll energy flows according to the\nwhims of the Great Magnet.\n\nC/U Barrel of the gun.  It fires.  An explosion of desert\ndirt.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhat a fool I was to defy Him.\n\nThe IGUANA sits unfazed.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNever cross the Great Magnet.  I\nunderstood this now...\n(another blast from\nthe gun)\n... and with understanding came a\nsense of almost terminal relief.\n\nDUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the\nthuds of the explosions echo away.\n\nEXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY\n\nThe RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.\n\n63.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI had to get rid of The Shark.  Too\nmany people might recognize it...\n...especially the Vegas Police.\n(tight C/U of DUKE)\nLuckily, my credit card was still\ntechnically valid.\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL:\n\nDUKE, now driving a white Cadillac Coupe de Ville -- THE\nWHITE WHALE.\n\nDUKE pushes buttons -- lowers the top.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThis was a superior machine -- ten\ngrand worth of gimmicks and high\nprice special effects.  The rear\nwindows leapt up with a touch like\nfrogs in a dynamited pond.  The\ndashboard was full of esoteric\nlights and dials and meters that I\nwould never understand.\n\nEXT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - AFTERNOON\n\nA GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S\nCONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIf the Pigs were gathering in\nVegas, I felt the Drug Culture\nshould be represented as well...\nand there was a certain bent appeal\nin the notion of running a savage\nburn on one Las Vegas hotel and\nthen just wheeling across town and\nchecking into another.\n\nThe WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately\nattended by impressed MINIONS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMe and a thousand ranking cops from\nall over America.  Why not?  Move\nconfidently into their midst.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON\n\nDUKE enters -- old Levis, grubby sneakers, 10 peso Acapulco\nshirt coming apart at the seams, 3 day growth, eyes hidden\nbehind mirror shades.  He heads for the check-in line.\n\n64.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy arrival was badly timed.\n\nTHE PLACE IS FULL OF COPS.  200 of them, on vacation, all\ndressed in cut price Vegas casuals: plaid Bermuda shorts,\nArnie Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals.\n\nAhead of DUKE -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK.\nThe POLICE CHIEF'S AGNEW STYLE WIFE stands to the side,\nweeping.  The POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around.\n\nPOLICE CHIEF\nWhat do you mean I'm too late to\nregister?  I'm a police chief.\nFrom Michigan.  Look, fella, I told\nyou.\n(waves a POSTCARD)\nI have a postcard here that says I\nhave reservations in this hotel.\n\nCLERK\n(prissily)\nI'm sorry, sir.  You're on the\n\"late list.\" Your reservations were\ntransferred to the... ah...\nMoonlight Motel, which is out on\nParadise Boulevard...\n\nPOLICE CHIEF\nI've already paid for my goddamn\nroom!\n\nCLERK\nIt's actually a very fine place of\nlodging and only sixteen blocks\nfrom here, with its own pool and...\n\nPOLICE CHIEF\nYou dirty little faggot!  Call the\nmanager!  I'm tired of listening to\nthis dogshit!\n\nFRIENDS restrain the POLICE CHIEF.\n\nCLERK\n(solicitously)\nI'm so sorry, sir.  May I call you\na cab?\n\nThe POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOf course, I could hear what the\nClerk was really saying...\n\n65.\n\n\nCLERK\n(IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION)\nListen, you fuzzy little shithead --\nI've been fucked around, in my\ntime, by a fairly good cross-\nsection of mean-tempered rule-crazy\ncops and now it's MY turn. \"Fuck\nyou, officer, I'm in charge here,\nand I'm telling you we don't have\nroom for you.\"\n\nDUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.\n\nDUKE\nSay.  I hate to interrupt, but I\nwonder if maybe I could just sort\nof slide through and get out of\nyour way.  Name's Raoul Duke --\nRaoul Duke.  My attorney made the\nreservation.\n\nDUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE\ngoes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he\nwas some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The\nCLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.\n\nCLERK\nCertainly, Mr. Duke!\n\nDUKE\nMy bags are out there in that white\nCadillac convertible.  Can you have\nsomeone drive it around to the room?\n\nALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.\n\nDUKE\nOh, and could I get a quart of Wild\nTurkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and\na night's worth of ice delivered to\nmy room, please?\n\nCLERK\nDon't worry about a thing, sir.\nJust enjoy your stay.\n\nDUKE\nWell, thank you.\n\nDUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the\nelevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of\nbeer and toasts them.  The doors close.\n\n66.\n\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE rams the key home -- swings the door open.\n\nDUKE\nAh, home at last!\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON\n\nDUKE enters.  The door hits something with a thud.\n\nA 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull.\n\nGONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a\ndrug-addled grin on his face.\n\nDUKE\nYou degenerate pig!\n\nGONZO\nIt can't be helped.  This is Lucy.\n(laughing distractedly)\nYou know--like \"Lucy In The Sky\nWith Diamonds.\"\n\nLUCY eyes DUKE venomously.\n\nGONZO\nLucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit!\nRemember what happened at the\nairport!  No more of that, okay?\n\nLUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his\narm round her shoulder.\n\nGONZO\nLucy... this is my client.  This is\nMr. Duke, the famous journalist.\nHe's paying for this suite, Lucy.\nHe's on our side.\n\nDUKE flops onto the sofa.\n\nGONZO\nMr. Duke is my friend.  He loves\nartists.\n\nDUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of\nartwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in\ncharcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.\n\nGONZO\nLucy paints portraits of Barbra\nStreisand.\n\n67.\n\n\nLUCY\nI drew these from TV.\n\nGONZO\nFantastic.  She came all the way\ndown here from Montana just to give\nthese portraits to Barbra.  We're\ngoing over to the Americana Hotel\ntonight to meet her backstage...\n\nDUKE's voice rises above GONZO.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI desperately needed peace, rest,\nsanctuary.  I hadn't counted on\nthis.  Finding my attorney on acid\nand locked into some kind of\npreternatural courtship.\n\nDUKE\nWell, I guess they brought the car\nround by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF\nOUT OF THE TRUNK.\n\nDUKE fixes GONZO hard.\n\nGONZO\nAbsolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF.\n(to LUCY)\nNow, we'll be right back.  Don't\nanswer the phone if it rings.\n\nLUCY\n(makes one-fingered\nJesus freak sign)\nGod bless.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE collars GONZO -- serious.\n\nDUKE\nWELL?  What are your plans?\n\nGONZO\nPlans?\n\nDUKE\nLucy.\n\n68.\n\n\nGONZO\n(struggling to focus)\nShit.  I met her on the plane and I\nhad all that acid.\n(he shrugs)\nYou know, those little blue barrels.\nI gave her a cap before I realized...\nshe's a religious freak... Jesus,\nshe's never even had a drink.\n\nDUKE\nWell... It'll probably work out.\nWe can keep her loaded and peddle\nher ass at the drug convention.\n\nGONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.\n\nGONZO\nListen, she's running away from\nhome for something like the fifth\ntime in six months.  It's terrible.\n\nDUKE\nShe's perfect for this gig.  These\ncops will go fifty bucks a head to\nbeat her into submission and then\ngang fuck her.  We can set her up\nin one of these back street motels,\nhang pictures of Jesus all over the\nroom, then turn these pigs loose on\nher... Hell she's strong; she'll\nhold her own.\n\nGONZO's face twitches badly.\n\nGONZO\nJesus Christ.  I knew you were sick\nbut I never expected to hear you\nactually say that kind of stuff.\n\nDUKE\nIt's straight economics.  This girl\nis a god-send.  Shit, she can make\nus a grand a day.\n\nGONZO\nNO!  Stop talking like that.\n\nDUKE\nI figure she can do about four at a\ntime.  Christ, if we keep her full\nof acid that's more like two grand\na day.  Maybe three.\n\n69.\n\n\nGONZO\nYou filthy bastard.  I should cave\nyour fucking head in.\n\nDUKE\nIn a few hours, she'll probably be\nsane enough to work herself into a\ntowering Jesus-based rage at the\nhazy recollection of being seduced\nby some kind of cruel Samoan who\nfed her liquor and LSD, dragged her\nto a Vegas hotel room and savagely\npenetrated every orifice in her\nbody with his throbbing,\nuncircumcised member.\n\nGONZO starts crying.\n\nGONZO\nNO!  I felt sorry for the girl, I\nwanted to help her!\n\nDUKE\nYou'll go straight to the gas\nchamber.  And even if you manage to\nbeat that, they'll send you back to\nNevada for Rape and Consensual\nSodomy.  She's got to go.\n\nPause.\n\nGONZO\nShit, it doesn't pay to try to help\nsomebody these days.\n\nA silence.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe only alternative was to take\nher out to the desert and feed her\nremains to the lizards.  But, it\nseemed a bit heavy for the thing we\nwere trying to protect: My attorney.\n\nGONZO\nWe have to cut her loose.  She's\ngot two hundred dollars.  And we\ncan always call the cops up there\nin Montana, where she lives, and\nturn her in.\n\nDUKE\nWhat?... What kind of goddamn\nmonster are you?\n\n70.\n\n\nGONZO\nIt just occurred to me, that she\nhas no witnesses.  Anything that\nshe says about us is completely\nworthless.\n\nDUKE\nUs?\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET\n\nDUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.\n\nDUKE\nHotel Americana?  I need a\nreservation.  For my niece.  Listen,\nI need her treated very gently.\nShe's an artist, and might seem a\ntrifle highstrung...\n\nIn the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the\ndoor.\n\nGONZO\nOkay, Lucy, it's time to go meet\nBarbra...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI felt like a Nazi, but it had to\nbe done.\n\nEXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK\n\nThe WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps\nLUCY and her paintings from the car.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nLucy was a potentially fatal\nmillstone on both our necks.  There\nwas absolutely no choice but to cut\nher adrift and hope her memory was\nfucked.\n\nGONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --\nwaves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting\nto come down...\n\nGONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands\ntogether as if washing his hands of the situation.\n\nGONZO\nWell that's that.  Take off slowly.\nDon't attract attention.\n\n71.\n\n\nThey pull out into traffic.\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK\n\nGONZO\nI gave the cabbie an extra ten\nbucks to make sure she gets there\nsafe.  Also, I told him I'd be\nthere myself in an hour, and if she\nwasn't, I'd come back out here and\nrip his lungs out.\n\nDUKE\nThat's good.  You can't be subtle\nin this town.\n\nGONZO\nAs your attorney, I advise you to\ntell me where you put the goddamn\nmescaline.\n\nDUKE\nMaybe we should take it easy tonight.\n\nGONZO\nRight.  Let's find a good seafood\nrestaurant and eat some red salmon.\nI feel a powerful lust for red\nsalmon...\n\nThe electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The\nsun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson\ntune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING\n\nGONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.\n\nIn the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him.\n\nDUKE\nCome on, we're going to be late.\n\nGONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth\nwith a towel.\n\nGONZO\nThis goddamn mescaline.  Why the\nfuck can't they make it a little\nless pure?  Maybe mix it up with\nRolaids or something.\n\n72.\n\n\nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n(crackling and\nbooming over the\nlousy sound system)\nOn behalf of the prosecuting\nattorneys of this county, I welcome\nyou to the Third National DA's\nConference on Narcotics and\nDangerous Drugs.\n\nThe EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman\ntype -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads:\nNATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. \"If You Don't Know, Come To\nLearn... If You Know, Come To Teach.\"\n\nA BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS\nAND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod\ndress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be\nWITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around\n20 REDNECKS.\n\nA dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles\ndistort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.\n\nAt the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI\nwingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name\ntag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.\n\nGONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT,\nCRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge.\n\nGONZO\n(lowers his voice)\nI saw these bastards in Easy Rider,\nbut I didn't believe they were real.\nNot like this.  Not hundreds of them!\n\nDUKE\nThey're actually nice people when\nyou get to know them.\n\nGONZO\nMan, I know these people in my\ngoddamn blood!\n\nDUKE\nDon't mention that word around here.\nYou'll get them excited.\n\nGONZO\nThis is a fucking nightmare.\n\n73.\n\n\nDUKE\nRight.  Sure as hell some dope-\ndealing bomb freak is going to\nrecognize you and put the word out\nthat you're partying with a thousand\ncops.\n\nCOP IN BACK\nSSSSHHH!\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST -- a \"drug expert\" -- takes the stage.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nWe must come to terms with the Drug\nCulture in the country... country...\ncountry...\n\nThe sound systems echoes.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)\nThe reefer butt is called a \"roach,\"\nbecause it resembles a cockroach...\ncockroach... cockroach...\n\nGONZO\n(whispers)\nWhat the fuck are these people\ntalking about?  You'd have to be\ncrazy on acid to think a joint\nlooked like a goddamn cockroach!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt was clear that we had stumbled\ninto a prehistoric gathering.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nNow, there are four states of being\nin the cannabis, or marijuana,\nsociety: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and\nSquare.  The square is seldom if\never cool.  He is not \"with it,\"\nthat is, he doesn't know \"what's\nhappening.\" But if he manages to\nfigure it out, he moves up a notch\nto \"hip.\"\n\nDUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)\nAnd if he can bring himself to\napprove of what is happening, he\nbecomes \"groovy.\" After that, with\nmuch luck and perseverance, he can\nrise to the rank of \"cool.\" A cool\nguy... cool guy... cool guy...\n\n74.\n\n\nCOP IN BACK\nDr. Bloomquist, do you think the\nanthropologist, Margaret Mead's\nstrange behavior of late might\npossibly be explained by a private\nmarijuana addiction?\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nI really don't know, but at her\nage, if she did smoke grass, she'd\nhave one hell of a trip!\n\nRoars of laughter.\n\nGONZO\nI know a hell of a lot better ways\nto waste my time than listening to\nthis bullshit.\n\nHe stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and\nplunges down the aisle to the door.\n\nCOP IN BACK\nDown in front!\n\nGONZO\nFuck you!  I have to get out!  I\ndon't belong here!\n\nCOP IN BACK\nGood riddance!\n\nHe stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to\nthe stage.\n\nThe lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER\nMADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nKNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE\nMAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be\nable to see his eyes because of\nTea-Shades, but his knuckles will\nbe white from inner tension...\n\nDUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF\nwho necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\n... and his pants will be crusted\nwith semen from constantly jacking\noff when he can't find a rape\nvictim...\n\n75.\n\n\nDUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness,\nhe gets up, hand over mouth.\n\nDUKE\nPardon me, I feel sick.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nHe will stagger and babble when\nquestioned.  He will not respect\nyour badge.  The Dope Fiend fears\nnothing.  He will attack, for no\nreason, with every weapon at his\ncommand -- including yours...\n\nDUKE heads for the exit.\n\nDUKE\nSorry, sick... Beg pardon!  Feeling\nsick...\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nBEWARE.  Any officer apprehending a\nsuspected marijuana addict should\nuse all necessary force immediately.\nOne stitch in time [on him] will\nusually save nine on you.\n\nDUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.\n\nINT. CASINO BAR - DAY\n\nDUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING\nCOP about 40 whose name tag identifies him as a DISTRICT\nATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA.\n\nDA\nI'm a whiskey man myself.  We don't\nhave much trouble from drugs where\nI come from...\n\nGONZO\nYou will.  One of these nights\nyou'll wake up and find a junkie\ntearing your bedroom apart.\n\nDA\nNaw!\n\nGONZO\nThey'll climb right into your\nbedroom and sit on your chest with\nbig Bowie knives.  They might even\nsit on your wife's chest.  Put the\nblade right down on her throat.\n\n76.\n\n\nDA\nNot down in my parts.\n\nDUKE joins them.\n\nDUKE\n(to WAITRESS)\nRum and ice, please.\n\nDA\n(looks at DUKE'S NAME TAG)\nYou're another one of these\nCalifornia boys.  Your friend\nhere's been tellin' us about dope\nfiends.\n\nDUKE\nThey're everywhere.  Nobody's safe.\nAnd sure as hell not in the South.\nThey like warm weather... You'd\nnever believe it.  In L.A. it's out\nof control.  First it was drugs,\nnow it's witchcraft.\n\nDA\nWitchcraft?  Shit, you can't mean it!\n\nThe BARTENDER cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the\nconversation.\n\nGONZO\nRead the newspapers.\n\nDUKE\nMan, you don't know trouble until\nyou have to face down a bunch of\nthese addicts gone crazy for human\nsacrifice!\n\nDA\nNaw!  That's science fiction stuff!\n\nDUKE\nNot where we operate.\n\nGONZO\nHell, in Malibu alone, these\ngoddamn Satan worshippers kill six\nor eight people every day.  All\nthey want is the blood.  They'll\ntake people right off the street if\nthey have to.\n\n77.\n\n\nDUKE\nJust the other day we had a case\nwhere they grabbed a girl right out\nof a McDonald's hamburger stand.\nShe was a waitress, about sixteen\nyears old... with a lot of people\nwatching, too!\n\nThe BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more\nfuriously.\n\nDA\nWhat happened?  What did they do to\nher?\n\nGONZO\nDo?  Jesus Christ, man.  They\nchopped her goddamn head off right\nthere in the parking lot!  Then\nthey cut all kinds of holes in her\nhead and sucked out the blood!\n\nDA\n(DA ad-libs a\nsummation of the crime)\nAnd nobody did anything?\n\nDUKE\nWhat could they do?  The guy that\ntook the head was about six-seven,\nand maybe three-hundred pounds.  He\nwas packing two Lugers, and the\nothers had M-16s.\n\nGONZO\nThey just ran back out into Death\nValley -- you know, where Manson\nturned up...\n\nDUKE\nLike big lizards.\n\nGONZO\n... and every one of them stacked\nnaked...\n\nDA\nNaked!?\n\nDUKE\nNaked.\n\n78.\n\n\nGONZO\nYeh, naked!... except for the\nweapons.\n\nDUKE\nThey were all veterans.\n\nDA\nVeterans?!!!?\n\nAgog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes\nthe glass -- faster and faster...\n\nGONZO\nYeh.  The big guy used to be a\nmajor in the Marines.\n\nDA\nA major!\n\nGONZO\nWe know where he lives, but we\ncan't get near the house.\n\nDA\nNaw!  Not a major.\n\nGONZO\nHe wanted the pineal gland.\n\nDA\nReally?\n\nGONZO\nThat's how he got so big.  When he\nquit the Marines he was just a\nlittle guy.\n\nDUKE\nUsually, it's whole families.\nDuring the night.  Most of them\ndon't even wake up until they feel\ntheir heads going -- and then, of\ncourse, it's too late.\n\nThe glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nHappens every day.\n\nDUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile.\n\n79.\n\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nThree more rums.  Plenty of ice.\nMaybe a handful of lime chunks.\n\nWAITRESS\nAre you guys with the police\nconvention upstairs?\n\nDA\nWe sure are, Miss.\n\nWAITRESS\nI thought so.  I never heard that\nkind of talk around here before.\nJesus Christ!  How do you guys\nstand that kind of work?\n\nGONZO\n(grinning)\nWe like it.  It's groovy.\n\nThe WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO.\n\nDUKE\nWhat's wrong with you?  Hell,\nsomebody has to do it.\n\nGONZO\nHurry up with those drinks.  We're\nthirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine\na Bloody Mary.\n\nDA\n(whacks his fist on\nthe bar)\nHell, I really hate to hear this.\nBecause everything that happens in\nCalifornia seems to get down our\nway, sooner or later.  Mostly\nAtlanta.  But that was back when\nthe goddamn bastards were peaceful.\nAll we had to do was to keep 'em\nunder surveillance.  They didn't\nroam around much... But now Jesus,\nit seems nobody's safe.\n\nGONZO\n(with a conspiratorial\nnod)\nYou're going to need to take the\nbull by the horns -- go to the mat\nwith this scum.\n\n80.\n\n\nDA\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nGONZO\nYou know what I mean.  We've done\nit before and we can damn well do\nit again!\n\nDUKE\nCut their goddamn heads off.  Every\none of them.  That's what we're\ndoing in California.\n\nDA\n(stupefied)\nWHAT?\n\nGONZO\nSure.  It's all on the Q.T., but\neverybody who matters is with us\nall the way down the line.\n\nDUKE\nWe keep it quiet.  It's not the\nkind of thing you'd want to talk\nabout upstairs.  Not with the press\naround.\n\nDA\n(recovering slightly)\nHell, no.  We'd never hear the\ngoddamn end of it.\n\nDUKE\nDobermans don't talk.\n\nDA\nWhat?\n\nGONZO\nSometimes it's easier to just rip\nout the backstraps.\n\nDUKE\nThey'll fight like hell if you try\nto take the head without the dogs.\n\nDA\nGod almighty!\n(muttering in a daze)\nI don't think I should tell my wife\nabout this.  She'd never understand.\nYou know how women are.\n\n81.\n\n\nDUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back.\n\nDUKE\nJust be thankful your heart is\nyoung and strong.\n\nDUKE and GONZO leave the stunned DA -- staring into the\nswirling ice in drink.\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.\n\nGONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the\nbathroom.  Immediate sounds of retching.\n\nThe phone message light is blinking.  DUKE opens a beer,\npicks up the phone.\n\nDUKE\nWhat's the message?  My light is\nblinking.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nAh, yes.  Mr. Duke?  You have one\nmessage: \"Call Lucy at the Americana\nHotel, room 1600.\"\n\nDUKE\nHoly shit!\n\nDUKE slams the phone down.  GONZO emerges from the\nbathroom -- looking like death.\n\nDUKE\nLucy called.\n\nGONZO sags visibly -- like an animal taking a bullet.\n\nGONZO\nWhat?\n\nThe telephone rings.  DUKE answers.\n\nINT.

What do you want?\n\nIn the background GONZO is upturning a sofa to retrieve his\nstash from the lining.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nThe woman who left that message for\nyou sounded very disturbed.  I\nthink she was crying...\n\nDUKE\nCrying?  Why was she crying?\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nWell, uh.  She didn't say Mr. Duke.\nBut since I know you're here with\nthe Police Convention...\n\nDUKE\nLook, you want to be gentle with\nthat woman if she ever calls again.\nWe're watching her very carefully...\nthis woman has been into laudanum.\nIt's a controlled experiment, but I\nsuspect we'll need your cooperation\nbefore this thing is over.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\n(hesitantly)\nWell, certainly... We're always\nhappy to cooperate with the police...\n\n83.\n\n\nDUKE\nDon't worry.  You're protected.\nJust treat this poor woman like\nyou'd treat any other human being\nin trouble.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nWhat?  Ah... yes, yes, I see what\nyou mean... Yes... so, you'll be\nresponsible then?\n\nDUKE\nOf course.  And now I have to get\nback to the news.  Send up some ice.\n\nHe hangs up.  GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.\n\nGONZO\nGood work.  They'll treat us like\ngoddamn lepers after that.\n\nDUKE\n(slowly, carefully)\nLucy is looking for you.\n\nGONZO\n(laughing)\nNo, she's looking for you.\n\nDUKE\nMe?\n\nGONZO\nShe really flipped over you.  The\nonly way I could get rid of her was\nby saying you were taking me out to\nthe desert for a showdown -- that\nyou wanted me out of the way so you\ncould have her all to yourself.\n(laughing again)\nI guess she figures you won.

HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE is madly stuffing his suitcase.\n\nGONZO\nWait!  You can't leave me alone in\nthis snake pit.  This room is in my\nname.\n\nDUKE KEEPS PACKING.  GONZO is looking worried.\n\nGONZO\nOK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call\nher.  I'll get her off our backs.\nYou're right.  She's my problem.\n\nDUKE\nIt's gone too far.\n\nGONZO\nRelax.  Let me handle this.\n(dials the PHONE,\nsnaps angrily at DUKE)\nYou'd make a piss-poor lawyer.\n...Room 1600, please.\n(to DUKE)\nAs your attorney, I advise you not\nto worry.\n(nods towards bathroom)\nTake a hit out of that little brown\nbottle in my shaving kit.\n\nDUKE goes in the bathroom.  He finds a little bottle -- a\nlabel: \"DRINK ME.\"\n\nDUKE\nWhat is this?\n\n85.\n\n\nGONZO\nYou won't need much.  Just a little\ntiny taste, that stuff makes pure\nmescaline seem like ginger-beer.\nAdrenochrome.\n\nDUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.\n\nDUKE\nAdrenochrome...\n\nGONZO\n(into PHONE)\nHi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got\nyour message...what?  Hell, no, I\ntaught the bastard a lesson he'll\nnever forget... what?  No, not\ndead, but he won't be bothering\nanybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left\nhim out there, I stomped him, then\npulled all his teeth out...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember thinking, \"Jesus, what a\nterrible thing to lay on somebody\nwith a head full of acid.\"\n\nDUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies\nit -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...\n\nGONZO\n(to PHONE)\nBut here's the problem.  That\nbastard cashed a bad check\ndownstairs and gave you as a\nreference.  They'll be looking for\nboth of you.  Yeah, I know, but you\ncan't judge a book by its cover,\nLucy.  Some people are just\nbasically rotten... Anyway, the\nlast thing you want to do is call\nthis hotel again; they'll trace the\ncall and put you straight behind\nbars... no, I'm moving to the\nTropicana right away.  I have to\ngo, they've got the phone tapped.\nYeah, I know, it was horrible, but\nit's all over now... OH MY GOD!\nTHEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN!\n(throws the PHONE\ndown; shouts)\nNo!  Get away from me!  I'm innocent!\nIt was Duke!  I swear to God!\n(MORE)\n\n86.\n\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\n(stomps the PHONE; moans)\nNo, I don't know where she is.\nYou'll never catch Lucy!  She's\ngone!

She's probably\nstuffing herself down the\nincinerator about now.  That's the\nlast we should be hearing from Lucy.\n(fumbling with the\nhash pipe)\nWhere's the opium?\n\nDUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY\nSTRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember slumping on the bed, his\nperformance had given me a bad jolt.\nFor a moment I thought his mind had\nsnapped -- that he actually believed\nhe was being attacked by invisible\nenemies.  But the room was quiet\nagain.\n\nDUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE.\n\nDUKE\nWhere'd you get this?\n\nGONZO\nNever mind, it's absolutely pure.\n\nDUKE\nJesus... what kind of monster\nclient have you picked up this time?\nThere's only one source for this\nstuff -- the adrenaline gland from\na living human body!\n\nGONZO turns to smile at DUKE.\n\n87.\n\n\nGONZO\nI know, but the guy didn't have any\ncash to pay me.  He's one of these\nSatanism freaks.  He offered me\nhuman blood -- said it would take\nme higher than I've ever been in my\nlife.\n(laughs -- struts\nround DUKE -- eyes\nbright with expectation)\nI thought he was kidding, so I told\nhim I'd just as soon have an ounce\nor so of pure adrenochrome -- or\nmaybe just a fresh adrenaline gland\nto chew on.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI could already feel the stuff\nworking on me -- the first wave\nfelt like a combination of mescaline\nand methedrine -- maybe I should\ntake a swim, I thought...\n\nDUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...\n\nGONZO\nYeah, they nailed this guy for\nchild molesting.  He swore he\ndidn't do it. \"Why should I fuck\nwith children?\" he says. \"They're\ntoo small.\" Christ, werewolf is\nentitled to legal counsel.  I\ndidn't dare turn the creep down.\nHe might have picked up a letter\nopener and gone after my pineal\ngland!\n\nGONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE.  DUKE'S BODY IS\nGOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  We should get some of\nthat.  Just eat a big handful and\nsee what happens.\n\nGONZO\nSome of what?\n\nDUKE\n(spitting words)\nExtract of pineal!\n\n88.\n\n\nGONZO\n(STARING AT DUKE WITH\nA STRANGE SMILE)\nSure.  That's a good idea.  One\nwhiff of that shit would turn you\ninto something out of a goddamn\nmedical encyclopedia.\n\nGONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK.\n\nGONZO\nMan, your head would swell up like\na watermelon, you'd probably gain\nabout a hundred pounds in two\nhours...\n\nA CLOVEN HOOF BURSTS THROUGH GONZO'S SHOE.\n\nDUKE\nRight!\n\nGONZO\n... grow claws... bleeding warts.\n\nGONZO'S CHEST EXPANDS -- BONY RIBS BURSTING HIS SHIRT.\n\nDUKE\nYes!\n\nGONZO\n... then you'd notice about six\nhuge hairy tits swelling up on your\nback...\n\nA TAIL LASHES, HOOFS STRIKE THE FLOOR.  GONZO TOWERS -- A\nFLAME RED DEMON!\n\nDUKE\nFantastic!\n\nDUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY\nat the bedspread, JERKING IT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM.  His\nheels are dug into the mattress with both KNEES LOCKED,\nEYEBALLS SWELLING.\n\nGONZO-DEMON LOOMS AGAINST THE CEILING.\n\nGONZO\nyou'd go blind... your body would\nturn to wax... they'd have to put\nyou in a wheelbarrow and...\n\nGONZO'S VOICE FADES AWAY -- DUKE'S frenzied gaze reveals\nGONZO REVERTED TO NORMAL HUMAN SHAPE AND SIZE.\n\n89.\n\n\nGONZO\nMan I'll try about anything; but\nI'd never touch a pineal gland.\n\nDUKE\nFINISH THE FUCKING STORY!  What\nhappened?!  What about the glands?\n\nGONZO, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily...\ntowards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE...\n\nGONZO\nJesus, that stuff got right on top\nof you, didn't it.\n\nVEINS stand out on DUKE's forehead.  He is purplish-red.\nOVER THE TOP!  Too late, he realizes he is NEAR DEATH!\n\nDUKE\nMaybe you could just... shove me\ninto the pool, or something...\n\nGONZO shakes his head disgustedly.\n\nGONZO\nIf I put you in the pool right now,\nyou'd sink like a goddamn stone.\nYou took too much.  Jesus, look at\nyour face, you're about to explode.\n\nGONZO sits back down... watching the TV.\n\nGONZO\nDon't try and fight it, or you'll\nget brain bubbles.  Strokes,\naneurysms.  You'll just wither up\nand die.\n\nDUKE FALLS TO THE GROUND, WRITHING, CATATONIC, SINKING INTO\nPARALYSIS.\n\nAND THE SOUND, SUDDENLY AND STRANGELY, OF THE VOICE OF\nRICHARD NIXON AND HIS DISTORTED FACE ON THE TV SCREEN.\n\nNIXON\nSacrifice... sacrifice...\nsacrifice...\n\nDUKE PASSES OUT.\n\nBLACK SCREEN\n\n90.\n\n\nINT.

He lies,\nawkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been\nthere days -- months.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhen I came to the general back\nalley ambiance of the suite was so\nrotten, so incredibly foul.  How\nlong had I been lying there?  Hours?\nDays?  Months?  All these signs of\nviolence.  What had happened?\n\nDUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE\nSIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving\nwhisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights\nreplace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,\npornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered\non a shattered mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere was evidence in this room of\nexcessive consumption of almost\nevery type of drug known to\ncivilized man since 1544 AD.\n\nDUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --\nHOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut what kind of addict would need\nall these coconut husks and crushed\nhoneydew rinds?  Would the presence\nof junkies account for all these\nuneaten french fries?  These\npuddles of glazed ketchup on the\nbureau?  Maybe so, but then why all\nthis booze?  And these crude\npornographic photos smeared with\nmustard that had dried to a hard\nyellow crust...\n\nDUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT\nRAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.\n\n91.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThese were not the hoof prints of\nyour normal god-fearing junkie.  It\nwas too savage, too aggressive.\n\nQUICK FLASHBACK:\n\nGONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER:\n\nBACK IN THE ROOM:\n\nDUKE stares at the smashed mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nGrim memories and bad flashbacks.\n\nIn the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN\nVOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS.\n\nDUKE unzips and pisses.

I was\nsure of it...\n\nDUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.\n\nThe SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.\n\nDUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out\nof the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE\nSMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF...\nsleeping on the sofa.\n\nThe ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.\n\nA hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO\ngrappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is\nmuffling her screams with an ice bag.\n\nMAID\nPlease... please... I'm only the\nmaid.  I didn't mean nothin!...\n\nDUKE\n(jumps up from the\nbed, flashing his\npress badge)\nYOU'RE UNDER ARREST!\n\n92.\n\n\nGONZO\n(to DUKE)\nShe must have used a pass key.

Who paid you\noff?\n\nMAID\nNobody.  I'm the maid!\n\nGONZO\nYou're lying!  You were after the\nevidence.

You're just as much a\npart of it as they are!\n\nMAID\nPart of what?\n\nDUKE\nThe dope ring.  You must know\nwhat's going on in this hotel.  Why\ndo you think we're here?\n\nMAID\n(blubbering)\nI know you're cops, but I thought\nyou were just here for that\nconvention.  I swear!  All I wanted\nto do was clean up the room.

I'll help you all you need!\nI hate dope!\n\nDUKE\nSo do we, lady.\n\nGONZO\n(helping her up)\nI think we should put her on the\npayroll.

Don't\nworry if it doesn't add up, that's\nour problem.\n\nGONZO hustles the MAID to the door.\n\nMAID\nYou'd pay me for that?\n\nDUKE\nYou're damn right.  But the first\ntime you say anything about this,\nto anybody -- you'll go straight to\nprison for the rest of your life.\nWhat's your name?\n\nMAID\nAlice.  Just ring Linen Service and\nask for Alice.\n\n94.\n\n\nGONZO\nAlright, Alice... you'll be\ncontacted by Inspector Rock.\nArthur Rock.  He'll be posing as a\npolitician.\n\nDUKE\nInspector Rock will pay you.  In\ncash.  A thousand dollars on the\nninth of every month.\n\nMAID\nOh Lord!  I'd do just about anything\nfor that!\n\nGONZO\nYou and a lot of other people.\n\nDUKE\nThe password is: \"One Hand Washes\nThe Other.\" The minute you hear\nthat, you say \"I fear nothing.\"\n\nMAID\nI fear nothing.\n\nShe repeats the password several times while they listen to\nmake sure she has it right.\n\nGONZO\nOh, and don't bother to make up the\nroom.  That way we won't have to\nrisk another of these little\nincidents, will we?\n\nMAID\nWhatever you say, gentlemen.  I\ncan't tell you how sorry I am about\nwhat happened...\n\nGONZO\nDon't worry, it's all over now.\nThank God for the decent people.\n\nShe smiles, repeating to herself \"One Hand Washes The Other\"\nas GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.\n\nCUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.\n\nA grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.\n\nGONZO ON TAPE\n...

DE CHARLUS \u2014 HIS CHARACTER PUZZLES ME MORE AND MORE \u2014 THE RED SHOES OF THE DUCHESS\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albeit it was simply a Sunday in autumn, I had been born again, life lay intact before me, for that morning, after a succession of mild days, there had been a cold mist which had not cleared until nearly midday. A change in the weather is sufficient to create the world and oneself anew. Formerly, when the wind howled in my chimney, I would listen to the blows which it struck on the iron trap with as keen an emotion as if, like the famous bow-taps with which the C Minor Symphony opens, they had been the irresistible appeal of a mysterious destiny. Every change in the aspect of nature offers us a similar transformation by adapting our desires so as to harmonise with the new form of things. The mist, from the moment of my awakening, had made of me, instead of the centrifugal being which one is on fine days, a self-centred man, longing for the chimney corner and the nuptial couch, a shivering Adam in quest of a sedentary Eve, in this different world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Between the soft grey tint of a morning landscape and the taste of a cup of chocolate I tried to account for all the originality of the physical, intellectual and moral life which I had taken with me, about a year earlier, to Donci\u00e8res, and which, blazoned with the oblong form of a bare hillside \u2014 always present even when it was invisible \u2014 formed in me a series of pleasures entirely distinct from all others, incommunicable to my friends, in the sense that the impressions, richly interwoven with one another, which gave them their orchestral accompaniment were a great deal more characteristic of them, to my subconscious mind, than any facts that I might have related. From this point of view the new world in which the mist of this morning had immersed me was a world already known to me (which only made it more real) and forgotten for some time (which restored all its novelty). And I was able to look at several of the pictures of misty landscapes which my memory had acquired, notably a series of \u2018Mornings at Donci\u00e8res,\u2019 including my first morning there in barracks and another, in a neighbouring country house, where I had gone with Saint-Loup to spend the night: in which from the windows, whose curtains I had drawn back at daybreak, before getting into bed again, in the first a trooper, in the second (on the thin margin of a pond and a wood all the rest of which was engulfed in the uniform and liquid softness of the mist) a coachman busy polishing a strap had appeared to me like those rare figures, scarcely visible to the eye obliged to adapt itself to the mysterious vagueness of their half-lights, which emerge from an obliterated fresco\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was from my bed that I was looking this afternoon at these pictorial memories, for I had gone back to bed to wait until the hour came at which, taking advantage of the absence of my parents, who had gone for a few days to Combray, I proposed to get up and go to a little play which was being given that evening in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room. Had they been at home I should perhaps not have ventured to go out; my mother in the delicacy of her respect for my grandmother\u2019s memory, wished the tokens of regret that were paid to it to be freely and sincerely given; she would not have forbidden me this outing, she would have disapproved of it. From Combray, on the other hand, had I consulted her wishes, she would not have replied in a melancholy: \u201cDo just as you like; you are old enough now to know what is right or wrong,\u201d but, reproaching herself for having left me alone in Paris, and measuring my grief by her own, would have wished for it distractions of a sort which she would have refused to herself, and which she persuaded herself that my grandmother, solicitous above all things for my health and the preservation of my nervous balance, would have advised me to take\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That morning the furnace of the new steam heater had for the first time been lighted. Its disagreeable sound \u2014 an intermittent hiccough \u2014 had no part whatsoever in my memories of Donci\u00e8res. But its prolonged encounter, in me this afternoon, with them was to give it so lasting an affinity with them that whenever, after succeeding more or less in forgetting it, I heard the central heater hiccough again it reminded me of them\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was no one else in the house but Fran\u00e7oise. The grey light, falling like a fine rain on the earth, wove without ceasing a transparent web through which the Sunday holiday-makers appeared in a silvery sheen. I had flung to the foot of my bed the Figaro, for which I had been sending out religiously every morning, ever since I had sent in an article which it had not yet printed; despite the absence of the sun, the intensity of the daylight was an indication that we were still only half-way through the afternoon. The tulle window-curtains, vaporous and friable as they would not have been on a fine day, had that same blend of beauty and fragility that dragon flies\u2019 wings have, and Venetian glass. It depressed me all the more that I should be spending this Sunday by myself because I had sent a note that morning to Mlle, de Stermaria. Robert de Saint-Loup, whom his mother had at length succeeded in parting \u2014 after painful and abortive attempts \u2014 from his mistress, and who immediately afterwards had been sent to Morocco in the hope of his there forgetting one whom he had already for some little time ceased to love, had sent me a line, which had reached me the day before, announcing his arrival, presently, in France for a short spell of leave. As he would only be passing through Paris (where his family were doubtless afraid of seeing him renew relations with Rachel), he informed me, to shew me that he had been thinking of me, that he had met at Tangier Mile, or rather Mme. (for she had divorced her husband three months after their marriage) de Stermaria. And Robert, remembering what I had told him at Balbec, had asked her, on my behalf, to arrange a meeting. She would be delighted to dine with me, she had told him, on one of the evenings which, before her return to Brittany, she would be spending in Paris. He warned me to lose no time in writing to Mme. de Stermaria, for she would certainly have arrived before I got his letter. This had corne as no surprise to me, even although I had had no news of him since, at the time of my grandmother\u2019s last illness, he had accused me of perfidy and treachery. It had then been quite easy to see what must have happened. Rachel, who liked to provoke his jealousy \u2014 she had other reasons also for wishing me harm \u2014 had persuaded her lover that I had made a dastardly attempt to have relations with her in his absence. It is probable that he continued to believe in the truth of this allegation, but he had ceased to be in love with her, which meant that its truth or falsehood had become a matter of complete indifference to him, and our friendship alone remained. When, on meeting him again, I attempted to speak to him about his attack on me his sole answer was a cordial and friendly smile, which gave him the air of begging my pardon; then he turned the conversation to something else. All this was not to say that he did not, a little later, see Rachel occasionally when he was in Paris. The fellow-creatures who have played a leading part in one\u2019s life very rarely disappear from it suddenly with any finality. They return to take their old place in it at odd moments (so much so as to lead people to believe in a renewal of old love) before leaving it for ever. Saint-Loup\u2019s breach with Rachel had very soon become less painful to him, thanks to the soothing pleasure that was given him by her incessant demands for money. Jealousy, which prolongs the course of love, is not capable of containing many more ingredients than are the other forms of imagination. If one takes with one, when one starts on a journey, three or four images which incidentally one is sure to lose on the way (such as the lilies and anemones heaped on the Ponte Vecchio, or the Persian church shrouded in mist), one\u2019s trunk is already pretty full. When one parts from a mistress one would be just as glad, until one has begun to forget her, that she should not become the property of three or four potential protectors whom one has in one\u2019s mind\u2019s eye, of whom, that is to say, one is jealous: all those whom one does not so picture count for nothing. Now frequent demands for money from a cast-off mistress no more give one a complete idea of her life than charts shewing a high temperature would of her illness. But the latter would at any rate be an indication that she was ill, and the former furnish a presumption, vague enough, it is true, that the forsaken one, or forsaker (whichever she be) cannot have found anything very remarkable in the way of rich protectors. And so each demand is welcomed with the joy which a lull produces in the jealous one\u2019s sufferings, while he responds to it at once by dispatching money, for naturally he does not like to think of her being in want of anything, except lovers (one of the three lovers he has in his mind\u2019s eye), until time has enabled him to regain his composure and he can learn without the slightest emotion the name of his successor. Sometimes Rachel came in so late at night that she could ask her former lover\u2019s permission to lie down beside him until the morning. This was a great comfort to Robert, for it refreshed his memory of how they had, after all, lived in intimacy together merely to see that even if he took the greater part of the bed for himself it did not in the least interfere with her sleep. He realised that she was more comfortable, lying close to his body, than she would have been elsewhere, that she felt herself, by his side \u2014 even in an hotel \u2014 to be in a bedroom known of old, in which the force of habit prevails and one sleeps better. He felt that his shoulders, his limbs, all of him were for her, even when he was unduly restless, from sleeplessness or from having to get up in the night things so entirely usual that they could not disturb her, and that the perception of them added still further to her sense of repose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To revert to where we were, I had been all the more disquieted by Robert\u2019s letter in that I could read between the lines what he had not ventured to write more explicitly. \u201cYou can most certainly ask her to dine in a private room,\u201d he told me. \u201cShe is a charming young person, a delightful nature you will get on splendidly with her, and I am sure you will have a capital evening together.\u201d As my parents were returning at the end of the week on Saturday or Sunday, and as after that I should be forced to dine every evening at home, I had written at once to Mme. de Stermaria, proposing any evening that might suit her, up to Friday. A message was brought back that I should hear from her in writing the same evening, about eight o\u2019clock. The time would have passed quickly enough if I had had, during the afternoon that separated me from her letter, the help of a visit from anyone else. When the hours pass wrapped in conversation one ceases to count, or indeed to notice them, they vanish, and suddenly it is a long way beyond the point at which it escaped you that there reappears the nimble truant time. But if we are alone, our preoccupation, by bringing before us the still distant and incessantly awaited moment with the frequency and uniformity of a ticking pendulum, divides, or rather multiplies the hours by all the minutes which, had we been with friends, we should not have counted. And confronted, by the incessant return of my desire, with the ardent pleasure which I was going to taste \u2014 not for some days though, alas! \u2014 in Mme. de Stermaria\u2019s company, this afternoon, which I should have to spend by myself, seemed to me very empty and very melancholy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every now and then I heard the sound of the lift coming up, but it was followed by a second sound, not that for which I was hoping, namely the sound of its coming to a halt at our landing, but another very different sound which the lift made in continuing its progress to the floors above and which, because it so often meant the desertion of my floor when I was expecting a visitor, remained for me at other times, even when I had no wish to see anyone, a sound lugubrious in itself, in which there echoed, as it were, a sentence of solitary confinement. Weary, resigned, busy for several hours still over its immemorial task, the grey day stitched its shimmering needlework of light and shade, and it saddened me to think that I was to be left alone with a thing that knew me no more than would a seamstress who, installed by the window so as to see better while she finished her work, paid no attention to the person present with her in the room. Suddenly, although I had heard no bell, Fran\u00e7oise opened the door to let in Albertine, who came forward smiling, silent, plump, containing in the fulness of her body, made ready so that I might continue living them, come in search of me, the days we had spent together at that Balbec to which I had never since returned. No doubt, whenever we see again a person with whom our relations \u2014 however trivial they may have been \u2014 are altered, it is like a juxtaposition of two different periods. For this, we do not require that a former mistress should come to call upon us as a friend, all that we need is the visit to Paris of a person whom we had known in the daily round of some particular kind of life, and that this life should have ceased for us, were it no more than a week ago. On each of Albertine\u2019s smiling, questioning, blushing features I could read the questions: \u201cAnd Madame de Villeparisis? And the dancing-master? And the pastry-cook?\u201d When she sat down her back seemed to be saying: \u201cGracious! There\u2019s no cliff here; you don\u2019t mind if I sit down beside you, all the same, as I used to do at Balbec?\u201d She was like an enchantress handing me a mirror that reflected time. In this she was like all the people whom we seldom see now but with whom at one time we lived on more intimate terms. With Al-bertine, however, there was something more than this. Certainly, even at Balbec, in our daily encounters, I had always been surprised when she came in sight, so variable was her appearance from day to day. But now it was difficult to recognise her. Cleared of the pink vapour that used to bathe them, her features had emerged like those of a statue. She had another face, or rather she had a face at last; her body too had grown. There remained scarcely anything now of the shell in which she had been enclosed and on the surface of which, at Balbec, her future outline had been barely visible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This time, Albertine had returned to Paris earlier than usual. As a rule she came only in the spring, which meant that, already disturbed for some weeks past by the storms that were beating down the first flowers, I did not distinguish, in the elements of the pleasure that I felt, the return of Albertine from that of the fine weather. It was enough that I should be told that she was in Paris and that she had called at the house, for me to see her again like a rose flowering by the sea. I cannot say whether it was the desire for Balbec or for herself that overcame me at such moments; possibly my desire for her was itself a lazy, cowardly, and incomplete method of possessing Balbec, as if to possess a thing materially, to take up one\u2019s abode in a town, were equivalent to possessing it spiritually. Besides, even materially, when she was no longer posed by my imagination before a horizon of sea, but sitting still in a room with me, she seemed to me often a very poor specimen of a rose, so poor, indeed, that I would gladly have shut my eyes in order not to observe this or that blemish of its petals, and to imagine instead that I was inhaling the salt air on the beach\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I must say it at this point, albeit I was not then aware of what was to happen only later on. Certainly, it is more reasonable to devote one\u2019s life to women than to postage stamps or old snuff-boxes, even to pictures or statues. Only the example of other collectors should be a warning to us to make changes, to have not one woman only but several. Those charming suggestions in which a girl abounds of a sea-beach, of the braided hair of a statue in church, of an old print, of everything that makes one see and admire in her, whenever she appears, a charming composition, those suggestions are not very stable. Live with a woman altogether and you will soon cease to see any of the things that made you love her; though I must add that these two sundered elements can be reunited by jealousy. If, after a long period of life in common, I was to end by seeing nothing more in Albertine than an ordinary woman, an intrigue between her and some person whom she had loved at Balbec would still suffice, perhaps, to reincorporate in her, to amalgamate the beach and the unrolling of the tide. Only, as these secondary suggestions no longer captivate our eyes, it is to the heart that they are perceptible and fatal. We cannot, under so dangerous a form, regard the repetition of the miracle as a thing to be desired. But I am anticipating the course of years. And here I need only state my regret that I did not have the sense simply to have kept my collection of women as people keep their collections of old quizzing glasses, never so complete, in their cabinet, that there is not room always for another and rarer still\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Departing from the customary order of her holiday movements, this year she had come straight from Balbec, where furthermore she had not stayed nearly so late as usual. It was a long time since I had seen her, and as I did not know even by name the people with whom she was in the habit of mixing in Paris, I could form no impression of her during the periods in which she abstained from coming to see me. These lasted often for quite a time. Then, one fine day, in would burst Albertine whose rosy apparitions and silent visits left me little if any better informed as to what she might have been doing in an interval which remained plunged in that darkness of her hidden life which my eyes felt little anxiety to pierce\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This time, however, certain signs seemed to indicate that some new experience must have entered into that life. And yet, perhaps, all that one was entitled to conclude from them was that girls change very rapidly at the age which Albertine had now reached. For instance, her intellect was now more in evidence, and on my reminding her of the day when she had insisted with so much ardour on the superiority of her idea of making Sophocles write: \u201cMy dear Racine,\u201d she was the first to laugh, quite wholeheartedly, at her own stupidity. \u201cAndr\u00e9e was quite right; it was stupid of me,\u201d she admitted. \u201cSophocles ought to have begun: \u2018Sir.\u2019\u201d I replied that the \u2018Sir,\u2019 and \u2018Dear Sir,\u2019 of Andr\u00e9e were no less comic than her own \u2018My dear Racine,\u2019 or Gis\u00e8le\u2019s \u2018My dear Friend,\u2019 but that after all the really stupid people were the Professors who still went on making Sophocles write letters to Racine. Here, however, Albertine was unable to follow me. She could not see in what the silliness consisted; her intelligence was dawning, but had not fully developed. There were other more attractive novelties in her; I felt, in this same pretty girl who had just sat down by my bed, something that was different; and in those lines which, in one\u2019s eyes and other features, express one\u2019s general attitude towards life, a change of front, a partial conversion, as though there had now been shattered those resistances against which I had hurled my strength in vain at Balbec, one evening, now remote in time, on which we formed a couple symmetrical with but the converse of our present arrangement, since then it had lieen she who was lying down and I who sat by her bedside. Wishing and not venturing to make certain whether now she would let herself be kissed, every time that she rose to go I asked her to stay beside me a little longer. This was a concession not very easy to obtain, for albeit she had nothing to do (otherwise she would have rushed from the house) she was a person methodical in her habits and moreover not very gracious towards me, scarcely to be at ease in my company, and yet each time, after looking at her watch, she sat down again at my request until finally she had spent several hours with me without my having asked her for anything; the things I was saying to her followed logically those that I had said during the hours before, and bore no relation to what I was thinking about, what I desired from her, remained indefinitely parallel. There is nothing like desire for preventing the thing one says from bearing any resemblance to what one has in one\u2019s mind. Time presses, and yet it seems as though we were seeking to gain time by speaking of subjects absolutely alien to that by which we are obsessed. We then arrange that the sentence which we should like to utter shall be accompanied, or rather preluded, by a gesture, supposing that is to say that we have not to give ourselves the pleasure of an immediate demonstration and to gratify the curiosity we feel as to the reactions which will follow it, without a word said, without even a \u2018By your leave,\u2019 already made this gesture. Certainly I was not in the least in love with Albertine; child of the mists outside, she could merely content the imaginative desire which the change of weather had awakened in me and which was midway between the desires that are satisfied by the arts of the kitchen and of monumental sculpture respectively, for it made me dream simultaneously of mingling with my flesh a substance different and warm, and of attaching at some point to my outstretched body a body divergent, as the body of Eve barely holds by the feet to the side of Adam, to whose body hers is almost perpendicular, in those romanesque bas-reliefs on the church at Balbec which represent in so noble and so reposeful a fashion, still almost like a classical frieze, the Creation of Woman; God in them is everywhere followed, as by two ministers, by two little angels in whom the visitor recognises \u2014 like winged, swarming summer creatures which winter has surprised and spared \u2014 cupids from Herculaneum, still surviving well into the thirteenth century, and winging their last slow flight, weary but never failing in the grace that might be expected of them, over the whole front of the porch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for this pleasure which by accomplishing my desire would have set me free from these meditations and which I should have sought quite as readily from any other pretty woman, had I been asked upon what \u2014 in the course of this endless flow of talk throughout which I took care to keep from Albertine the one thing that was in my mind \u2014 was based my optimistic hypothesis with regard to her possible complaisances, I should perhaps have answered that this hypothesis was due (while the forgotten outlines of Albertine\u2019s voice retraced for me the contour of her personality) to the apparition of certain words which did not form part of her vocabulary, or at least not in the acceptation which she now gave them. Thus she said to roe that Elstir was stupid, and, on my protesting:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she replied, smiling, \u201cI mean that it was stupid of him to behave like that; of course I know he\u2019s quite a distinguished Person, really.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, wishing to say of the Fontainebleau golf club that it was smart, she declared: \u201cThey are quite a selection.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Speaking of a duel that I had fought, she said of my seconds: \u201cWhat very choice seconds,\u201d and looking at my face confessed that she would like to see me \u2018wear a moustache.\u2019 She even went so far (and my chance appeared then enormous) as to announce, in a phrase of which I would have sworn that she was ignorant a year earlier, that since she had last seen Gis\u00e8le there had passed a certain \u2018lapse of time.\u2019 This was not to say that Albertine had not already possessed, when I was at Balbec, a quite adequate assortment of those expressions which reveal at once that one\u2019s people are in easy circumstances, and which, year by year, a mother passes on to her daughter just as she bestows on her, gradually, as the girl grows up, on important occasions, her own jewels. It was evident that Albertine had ceased to be a little girl when one day, to express her thanks for a present which a strange lady had given her, she had said: \u201cI am quite confused.\u201d Mme. Bontemps could not help looking across at her husband whose comment was:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cGad, she\u2019s old for fourteen.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The approach of nubility had been more strongly marked still when Albertine, speaking of another girl whose tone was bad, said: \u201cOne can\u2019t even tell whether she\u2019s pretty, she paints her face a foot thick.\u201d Finally, though still a schoolgirl, she already displayed the manner of a grown woman of her upbringing and station when she said, of some one whose face twitched: \u201cI can\u2019t look at him, because it makes me want to do the same,\u201d or, if some one else were being imitated: \u201cThe absurd thing about it is that when you imitate her voice you look exactly like her.\u201d All these are drawn from the social treasury. But it did not seem to me possible that Albertine\u2019s natural environment could have supplied her with \u2018distinguished,\u2019 used in the sense in which my father would say of a colleague whom he had not actually met, but whose intellectual attainments he had heard praised: \u201cIt appears he\u2019s quite a distinguished person.\u201d \u2018Selection,\u2019 even when used of a golf club, seemed to me as incompatible with the Simonet family as it would be if preceded by the adjective \u2018Natural,\u2019 with a text published centuries before the researches of Darwin. \u2018Lapse of time\u2019 struck me as being of better augury still. Finally there appeared the evidence of certain upheavals, the nature of which was unknown to me, but sufficient to justify me in all my hopes when Albertine announced, with the satisfaction of a person whose opinion is by no means to be despised:\nYou might also like\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo my mind, that is the best thing that could possibly happen. I regard it as the best solution, the stylish way out.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was so novel, so manifestly an alluvial deposit giving one to suspect such capricious wanderings over soil hitherto unknown to her, that on hearing the words \u2018to my mind\u2019 I drew Albertine towards me, and at \u2018I regard\u2019 made her sit on the side of my bed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt it does happen that women of moderate culture, on marrying well-read men, receive such expressions as part of their paraphernalia. And shortly after the metamorphosis which follows the wedding night, when they begin to pay calls, and talk shyly to the friends of their girlhood, one notices with surprise that they have turned into matrons if, in deciding that some person is intelligent, they sound both l\u2019s in the word; but that is precisely the sign of a change of state, and I could see a difference when I thought of the vocabulary of the Albertine I had known of old \u2014 a vocabulary in which the most daring flights were to say of any unusual person: \u2018He\u2019s a type,\u2019 or, if you suggested a game of cards to her: \u2018I\u2019ve no money to lose,\u2019 or again, if any of her friends were to reproach her, in terms which she felt to be undeserved: \u2018That really is magnificent!\u2019 an expression dictated in such cases by a sort of middle-class tradition almost as old as the Magnificat itself, and one which a girl slightly out of temper and confident that she is in the right employs, as the saying is, \u2018quite naturally,\u2019 that is to say because she has learned the words from her mother, just as she has learned to say her prayers or to greet a friend. All these expressions Mme. Bontemps had imparted to her at the same time as her hatred of the Jews and her feeling for black, which was always suitable and becoming, indeed without any formal instruction, but as the piping of the parent goldfinches serves as a model for that of the young ones, recently hatched, so that they in turn grow into true goldfinches also. But when all was said, \u2018selection\u2019 appeared to me of alien growth and \u2018I regard\u2019 encouraging. Albertine was no longer the same; which meant that she would not perhaps act, would not react in the same way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only did I no longer feel any love for her, but I had no longer to consider, as I should have had at Balbec, the risk of shattering in her an affection for myself, which no longer existed. There could be no doubt that she had long since become quite indifferent to me. I was well aware that to her I was in no sense a member now of the \u2018little band\u2019 into which I had at one time so anxiously sought and had then been so happy to have secured admission. Besides, as she had no longer even, as in Balbec days, an air of frank good nature, I felt no serious scruples: still I believe that what made me finally decide was another philological discovery. As, continuing to add fresh links to the external chain of talk behind which I hid my intimate desire, I spoke, having Albertine secure now on the corner of my bed, of one of the girls of the little band, one smaller than the rest, whom, nevertheless, I had thought quite pretty, \u201cYes,\u201d answered Albertine, \u201cshe reminds me of a little mousm\u00e9.\u201d There had been nothing in the world to shew, when I first knew Albertine, that she had ever heard the wordmousm\u00e9. It was probable that, had things followed their normal course, she would never have learned it, and for my part I should have seen no cause for regret in that, for there is no more horrible word in the language. The mere sound of it makes one\u2019s teeth ache as they do when one has put too large a spoonful of ice in one\u2019s mouth. But coming from Albertine, as she sat there looking so pretty, not even \u2018mousm\u00e9\u2018 could strike me as unpleasant. On the contrary, I felt it to be a revelation, if not of an outward initiation, at any rate of an inward evolution. Unfortunately it was now time for me to bid her good-bye if I wished her to reach home in time for her dinner, and myself to be out of bed and dressed in time for my own. It was Fran\u00e7oise who was getting it ready; she did not like having to keep it back, and must already have found it an infringement of one of the articles of her code that Albertine, in the absence of my parents, should be paying me so prolonged a visit, and one which was going to make everything late. But before \u2018mousm\u00e9\u2018 all these arguments fell to the ground and I hastened to say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust fancy; I\u2019m not in the least ticklish; you can go on tickling me for an hour on end and I won\u2019t even feel it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI assure you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She understood, doubtless, that this was the awkward expression of a desire on my part, for, like a person who offers to give you an introduction for which you have not ventured to ask him, though what you have said has shewn him that it would be of great service to you\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWould you like me to try?\u201d she inquired, with womanly meekness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust as you like, but you would be more comfortable if you lay down properly on the bed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLike that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; get right on top.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re sure I\u2019m not too heavy?\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she uttered these words the door opened and Fran\u00e7oise, carrying a lamp, came in. Albertine had just time to fling herself back upon her chair. Perhaps Fran\u00e7oise had chosen this moment to confound us, having been listening at the door or even peeping through the keyhole. But there was no need to suppose anything of the sort; she might have scorned to assure herself, by the use of her eyes, of what her instinct must plainly enough have detected, for by dint of living with me and my parents her fears, her prudence, her alertness, her cunning had ended by giving her that instinctive and almost prophetic knowledge of us all that the mariner has of the sea, the quarry of the hunter, and, of the malady, if not the physician, often at any rate the patient. The amount of knowledge that she managed to acquire would have astounded a stranger, and with as good reason as does the advanced state of certain arts and sciences among the ancients, seeing that there was practically no source of information open to them. (Her sources were no larger. They were a few casual remarks forming barely a twentieth part of our conversation at dinner, caught on the wing by the butler and inaccurately transmitted to the kitchen.) Again, her mistakes were due, like theirs, like the fables in which Plato believed, rather to a false conception of the world and to preconceived ideas than to the insufficiency of the materials at her disposal. Only the other day, has it not been possible for the most important discoveries as to the habits of insects to be made by a scientist who had access to no laboratory and used no instruments of any sort? But if the drawbacks arising from her menial position had not prevented her from acquiring a stock of learning indispensable to the art which was its ultimate goal \u2014 and which consisted in putting us to confusion by communicating to us the results of her discoveries \u2014 the limitations under which she worked had done more; in this case the impediment, not content with merely not paralysing the flight of her imagination, had greatly strengthened it. Of course Fran\u00e7oise never let slip any artificial device, those for example of diction and attitude. Since (if she never believed what we said to her, hoping that she would believe it) she admitted without any shadow of doubt the truth of anything that any person of her own condition in life might tell her, however absurd, which might at the same time prove shocking to our ideas, just as her way of listening to our assertions bore witness to her incredulity, so the accents in which she reported (the use of indirect speech enabling her to hurl the most deadly insults at us with impunity) the narrative of a cook who had told her how she had threatened her employers, and won from them, by treating them before all the world like dirt, any number of privileges and concessions, shewed that the story was to her as gospel. Fran\u00e7oise went so far as to add: \u201cI\u2019m sure, if I had been the mistress I should have been quite vexed.\u201d In vain might we, despite our scant sympathy at first with the lady on the fourth floor, shrug our shoulders, as though at an unlikely fable, at this report of so shocking an example; in making it the teller was able to speak with the crushing, the lacerating force of the most unquestionable, most irritating affirmation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But above all, just as great writers often attain to a power of concentration from which they would have been dispensed under a system of political liberty or literary anarchy, when they are bound by the tyranny of a monarch or of a school of poetry, by the severity of prosodie laws or of a state religion, so Fran\u00e7oise, not being able to reply to us in an explicit fashion, spoke like Tiresias and would have written like Tacitus. She managed to embody everything that she could not express directly in a sentence for which we could not find fault with her without accusing ourselves, indeed in less than a sentence, in a silence, in the way in which she placed a thing in a room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus when I happened to leave, by accident, on my table, among a pile of other letters, one which it was imperative that she should not see, because, let us say, it referred to her with a dislike which afforded a presumption of the same feeling towards her in the recipient as in the writer, that evening, if I came home with a troubled conscience and went straight to my room, there on top of my letters, neatly arranged in a symmetrical pile, the compromising document caught my eye as it could not possibly have failed to catch the eye of Fran\u00e7oise, placed by her right at the top, almost separated from the rest, in a prominence that was a form of speech, that had an eloquence all its own, and, as I stood in the doorway, made me shudder like a cry. She excelled in the preparation of these scenic effects, intended so to enlighten the spectator, in her absence, that he already knew that she knew everything when in due course she made her appearance. She possessed, for thus making an inanimate object speak, the art, at once inspired and painstaking, of Irving or Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Lema\u00eetre. On this occasion, holding over Albertine and myself the lighted lamp whose searching beams missed none of the still visible depressions which the girl\u2019s body had hollowed in the counterpane, Fran\u00e7oise made one think of a picture of \u2018Justice throwing light upon Crime.\u2019 Albertine\u2019s face did not suffer by this illumination. It revealed on her cheeks the same sunny burnish that had charmed me at Balbec. This face of Albertine, the general effect of Which sometimes was, out of doors, a sort of milky pallor, now shewed, according as the lamp shone on them, surfaces so dazzlingly, so uniformly coloured, so firm, so glowing that one might have compared them to the sustained flesh tints of certain flowers. Taken aback meanwhile by the unexpected entry of Fran\u00e7oise, I exclaimed:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat? The lamp already? I say, the light is strong!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My object, as may be imagined, was by the second of these ejaculations to account for my confusion, by the first to excuse my lateness in rising. Fran\u00e7oise replied with a cruel ambiguity:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you want me to extinglish it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c\u2014 guish!\u201d Albertine slipped into my ear, leaving me charmed by the familiar vivacity with which, taking me at once for teacher and for accomplice, she insinuated this psychological affirmation as though asking a grammatical question. When Fran\u00e7oise had left the room and Albertine was seated once again on my bed:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you know what I\u2019m afraid of?\u201d I asked her. \u201cIt is that if we go on like this I may not be able to resist the temptation to kiss you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat would be a fine pity.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not respond at once to this invitation, which another man might even have found superfluous, for Albertine\u2019s way of pronouncing her words was so carnal, so seductive that merely in speaking to you she seemed to be caressing you. A word from her was a favour, and her conversation covered you with kisses. And yet it was highly attractive to me, this invitation. It would have been so, indeed, coming from any pretty girl of Albertine\u2019s age; but that Albertine should be now so accessible to me gave me more than pleasure, brought before my eyes a series of images that bore the stamp of beauty. I recalled the original Albertine standing between me and the beach, almost painted upon a background of sea, having for me no more real existence than those figures seen on the stage, when one knows not whether one is looking at the actress herself who is supposed to appear, at an understudy who for the moment is taking her principal\u2019s part, or at a mere projection from a lantern. Then the real woman had detached herself from the luminous mass, had come towards me, with the sole result that I had been able to see that she had nothing in real life of that amorous facility which one supposed to be stamped upon her in the magic pictures. I had learned that it was not possible to touch her, to embrace her, that one might only talk to her, that\u2019 for me she was no more a woman than the jade grapes, an inedible decoration at one time in fashion on dinner tables, are really fruit. And now she was appearing to me in a third plane, real as in the second experience that I had had of her but facile as in the first; facile, and all the more deliciously so in that I had so long imagined that she was not. My surplus knowledge of life (of a life less uniform, less simple than I had at first supposed it to be) inclined me provisionally towards agnosticism. What can one positively affirm, when the thing that one thought probable at first has then shewn itself to be false and in the third instance turns out true? And alas, I was not yet at the end of my discoveries with regard to Albertine. In any case, even if there had not been the romantic attraction of this disclosure of a greater wealth of planes revealed one after another by life (an attraction the opposite of that which Saint-Loup had felt during our dinners at Rivebelle on recognising beneath the mask with which the course of existence had overlaid them, in a calm face, features to which his lips had once been pressed), the knowledge that to kiss Albertine\u2019s cheeks was a possible thing was a pleasure perhaps greater even than that of kissing them. What a difference between possessing a woman to whom one applies one\u2019s body alone, because she is no more than a piece of flesh, and possessing the girl whom one used to see on the beach with her friends on certain days without even knowing why one saw her on those days and not on others, which made one tremble to think that one might not see her again. Life had obligingly revealed to one in its whole extent the romance of this little girl, had lent one, for the study of her, first one optical instrument, then another, and had added to one\u2019s carnal desire an accompaniment which multiplied it an hundredfold and diversified it with those other desires, more spiritual and less easily assuaged, which do not emerge from their torpor, leaving carnal desire to move by itself, when it aims only at the conquest of a piece of flesh, but which to gain possession of a whole tract of memories, whence they have felt the wretchedness of exile, rise in a tempest round about it, enlarge, extend it, are unable to follow it to the accomplishment, the assimilation, impossible in the form in which it is looked for, of an immaterial reality, but wait for this desire halfway and at the moment of recollection, of return furnish it afresh with their escort; to kiss, instead of the cheeks of the first comer, however cool and fresh they might be, but anonymous, with no secret, with no distinction, those of which I had so long been dreaming, would be to know the taste, the savour of a colour on which I had endlessly gazed. One has seen a woman, a mere image in the decorative setting of life, like Albertine, outlined against the sea, and then one has been able to take that image, to detach it, to bring it close to oneself, gradually to discern its solidity, its colours, as though one had placed it behind the glasses of a stereoscope. It is for this reason that the women who are a little difficult, whose resistance one does not at once overcome, of whom one does not indeed know at first whether one ever will overcome it, are alone interesting. For to know them, to approach them, to conquer them is to make fluctuate in form, in dimensions, in relief the human image, is an example of relativity in the appreciation of an image which it is delightful to see afresh when it has resumed the slender proportions of a silhouette in the setting of one\u2019s life. The women one meets first of all in a brothel are of no interest because they remain invariable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Albertine preserved, inseparably attached to her, all my impressions of a series of seascapes of which I was particularly fond. I felt that it was possible for me, on the girl\u2019s two cheeks, to kiss the whole of the beach at Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf you really don\u2019t mind my kissing you, I would rather put it off for a little and choose a good moment. Only you mustn\u2019t forget that you\u2019ve said I may. I shall want a voucher: \u2018Valid for one kiss.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShall I have to sign it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut if I took it now, should I be entitled to another later on?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou do make me laugh with your vouchers; I shall issue a new one every now and then.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me; just one thing more. You know, at Balbec, before I had been introduced to you, you used often to have a hard, calculating look; you can\u2019t tell me what you were thinking about when you looked like that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; I don\u2019t remember at all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait; this may remind you: one day your friend Gis\u00e8le put her feet together and jumped over the chair an old gentleman was sitting in. Try to remember what was in your mind at that moment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGis\u00e8le was the one we saw least of; she did belong to the band, I suppose, but not properly. I expect I thought that she was very ill-bred and common.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, is that all?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should certainly have liked, before kissing her, to be able to fill her afresh with the mystery which she had had for me on the beach before I knew her, to find latent in her the place in which she had lived earlier still; for that, at any rate, if I knew nothing of it, I could substitute all my memories of our life at Balbec, the sound of the waves rolling up and breaking beneath my window, the shouts of the children. But when I let my eyes glide over the charming pink globe of her cheeks, the gently curving surfaces of which ran up to expire beneath the first foothills of her piled black tresses which ran in undulating mountain chains, thrust out escarped ramparts and moulded the hollows of deep valleys, I could not help saying to myself: \u201cNow at last, after failing at Balbec, I am going to learn the fragrance of the secret rose that blooms in Albertine\u2019s cheeks, and, since the cycles through which we are able to make things and people pass in the course of our existence are comparatively few, perhaps I ought now to regard mine as nearing its end when, having made to emerge from its remoteness the flowering face that I had chosen from among all others, I shall have brought it into this new plane in which I shall at last acquire a tactual experience of it with my lips.\u201d I told myself this because I believed that there was such a thing as knowledge acquired by the lips; I told myself that I was going to know the taste of this fleshly rose, because I had never stopped to think that man, a creature obviously less rudimentary in structure than the sea-urchin or even the whale, is nevertheless still unprovided with a certain number of essential organs, and notably possesses none that will serve for kissing. The place of this absent organ he supplies with his lips, and thereby arrives perhaps at a slightly more satisfying result than if he were reduced to caressing the beloved with a horny tusk. But a pair of lips, designed to convey to the palate the taste of whatever whets the appetite, must be content, without ever realising their mistake or admitting their disappointment, with roaming over the surface and with coming to a halt at the barrier of the impenetrable but irresistible cheek. Besides, at such moments, at the actual contact between flesh and flesh, the lips, even supposing them to become more expert and better endowed, could taste no better probably the savour which nature prevents their ever actually grasping, for in that desolate zone in which they are unable to find their proper nourishment, they are alone; the sense of sight, then that of smell have long since deserted them. To begin with, as my mouth began gradually to approach the cheeks which my eyes had suggested to it that it should kiss, my eyes, changing their position, saw a different pair of cheeks; the throat, studied at closer range and as though through a magnifying glass shewed in its coarse grain a robustness which modified the character of the face\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from the most recent applications of the art of photography \u2014 which set crouching at the foot of a cathedral all the houses which, time and again, when we stood near them, have appeared to us to reach almost to the height of the towers, drill and deploy like a regiment, in file, in open order, in mass, the same famous and familiar structures, bring into actual contact the two columns on the Piazzetta which a moment ago were so far apart, thrust away the adjoining dome of the Salute, and in a pale and toneless background manage to include a whole immense horizon within the span of a bridge, in the embrasure of a window, among the leaves of a tree that stands in the foreground and is portrayed in a more vigorous tone, give successively as setting to the same church the arched walls of all the others \u2014 I can think of nothing that can so effectively as a kiss evoke from what we believe to be a thing with one definite aspect, the hundred other things which it may equally well be since each is related to a view of it no less legitimate. In short, just as at Balbec Albertine had often appeared to me different, so now, as if, wildly accelerating the speed of the changes of aspect and changes of colouring which a person presents to us in the course of our various encounters, I had sought to contain them all in the space of a few seconds so as to reproduce experimentally the phenomenon which diversifies the individuality of a fellow creature, and to draw out one from another, like a nest of boxes, all the possibilities that it contains, in this brief passage of my lips towards her cheek it was ten Albertines that I saw; this single girl being like a goddess with several heads, that which I had last seen, if I tried to approach it, gave place to another. At least so long as I had not touched it, that head, I could still see it, a faint perfume reached me from it. But alas \u2014 for in this matter of kissing our nostrils and eyes are as ill placed as our lips are shaped \u2014 suddenly my eyes ceased to see; next, my nose, crushed by the collision, no longer perceived any fragrance, and, without thereby gaining any clearer idea of the taste of the rose of my desire, I learned, from these unpleasant signs, that at last I was in the act of kissing Albertine\u2019s cheek\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it because we were enacting \u2014 as may be illustrated by the rotation of a solid body \u2014 the converse of our scene together at Balbec, because it was I, now, who was lying in bed and she who sat beside me, capable of evading any brutal attack and of dictating her pleasure to me, that she allowed me to take so easily now what she had refused me on the former occasion with so forbidding a frown? (No doubt from that same frown the voluptuous expression which her face assumed now at the approach of my lips differed only by a deviation of its lines immeasurably minute but one in which may be contained all the disparity that there is between the gesture of \u2018finishing off\u2019 a wounded man and that of bringing him relief, between a sublime and a hideous portrait.) Not knowing whether I had to give the credit, and to feel grateful for this change of attitude to some unwitting benefactor who in these last months, in Paris or at Balbec, had been working on my behalf, I supposed that the respective positions in which we were now placed might account for it. It was quite another explanation, however, that Albertine offered me; this, in short: \u201cOh, well, you see, that time at Balbec I didn\u2019t know you properly. For all I knew, you might have meant mischief.\u201d This argument left me in perplexity. Albertine was no doubt sincere in advancing it. So difficult is it for a woman to recognise in the movements of her limbs, in the sensations felt by her body in the course of an intimate conversation with a friend, the unknown sin into which she would tremble to think that a stranger was planning her fall\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any case, whatever the modifications that had occurred at some recent time in her life, which might perhaps have explained why it was that she now readily accorded to my momentary and purely physical desire what at Balbec she had with horror refused to allow to my love, another far more surprising manifested itself in Albertine that same evening as soon as her caresses had procured in me the satisfaction which she could not have failed to notice, which, indeed, I had been afraid might provoke in her the instinctive movement of revulsion and offended modesty which Gilberte had given at a corresponding moment behind the laurel shrubbery in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The exact opposite happened. Already, when I had first made her lie on my bed and had begun to fondle her, Albertine had assumed an air which I did not remember in her, of docile good will, of an almost childish simplicity. Obliterating every trace of her customary anxieties and interests, the moment preceding pleasure, similar in this respect to the moment after death, had restored to her rejuvenated features what seemed like the innocence of earliest childhood. And no doubt everyone whose special talent is suddenly brought into play becomes modest, devoted, charming; especially if by this talent he knows that he is giving us a great pleasure, he is himself happy in the display of it, anxious to present it to us in as complete a form as possible. But in this new expression on Albertine\u2019s face there was more than a mere profession of disinterestedness, conscience, generosity, a sort of conventional and unexpected devotion; and it was farther than to her own childhood, it was to the infancy of the race that she had reverted. Very different from myself who had looked for nothing more than a physical alleviation, which I had finally secured, Albertine seemed to feel that it would indicate a certain coarseness on her part were she to seem to believe that this material pleasure could be unaccompanied by a moral sentiment or was to be regarded as terminating anything. She, who had been in so great a hurry a moment ago, now, presumably because she felt that kisses implied love and that love took precedence of all other duties, said when I reminded her of her dinner:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but that doesn\u2019t matter in the least; I have plenty of time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She seemed embarrassed by the idea of getting up and going immediately after what had happened, embarrassed by good manners, just as Fran\u00e7oise when, without feeling thirsty, she had felt herself bound to accept with a seemly gaiety the glass of wine which Jupien offered her, would never have dared to leave him as soon as the last drops were drained, however urgent the call of duty. Albertine \u2014 and this was perhaps, with another which the reader will learn in due course, one of the reasons which bad made me unconsciously desire her \u2014 was one of the incarnations of the little French peasant whose type may be seen in stone at Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs. As in Fran\u00e7oise, who presently nevertheless was to become her deadly enemy, I recognised in her a courtesy towards friend and stranger, a sense of decency, of respect for the bedside\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise who, after the death of my aunt, felt obliged to speak only in a plaintive tone, would, in the months that preceded her daughter\u2019s marriage, have been quite shocked if, when the young couple walked out together, the girl had not taken her lover\u2019s arm. Albertine lying motionless beside me said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat nice hair you have; what nice eyes; you are a dear boy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, after pointing out to her that it was getting late, I added: \u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d she replied, what was perhaps true but could be so only since the minute before and for the next few hours:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI always believe you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She spoke to me of myself, my family, my social position. She said: \u201cOh, I know your parents know some very nice people. You are a friend of Robert Forestier and Suzanne Delage.\u201d For the moment these names conveyed absolutely nothing to me. But suddenly I remembered that I had indeed played as a child in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es with Robert Forestier, whom I had never seen since then. As for Suzanne Delage, she was the great-niece of Mme. Blatin, and I had once been going to a dancing lesson, and had even promised to take a small part in a play that was being acted in her mother\u2019s drawing-room. But the fear of being sent into fits of laughter, and of a bleeding nose, had made me decline, so that I had never set eyes on her. I had at the most a vague idea that I had once heard that the Swanns\u2019 governess with the feather in her hat had at one time been with the Delages, but perhaps it was only a sister of this governess, or a friend. I protested to Albertine that Robert Forestier and Suzanne Delage occupied a very small place in my life. \u201cThat may be; but your mothers are friends, I can place you by that. I often pass Suzanne Delage in the Avenue de Messine, I admire her style.\u201d Our mothers were acquainted only in the imagination of Mme. Bontemps, who having heard that I had at one time played with Robert Forestier, to whom, it appeared, I used to recite poetry, had concluded from that that we were bound by family ties. She could never, I gathered, hear my mother\u2019s name mentioned without observing: \u201cOh, yes, she is in the Delage Forestier set,\u201d giving my parents a good mark which they had done nothing to deserve\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from this, Albertine\u2019s social ideas were fatuous in the extreme. She regarded the Simonnets with a double \u2018n\u2019 as inferior not only to the Simonets with a single \u2018n\u2019 but to everyone in the world. That some one else should bear the same name as yourself without belonging to your family is an excellent reason for despising him. Of course there are exceptions. It may happen that two Simonnets (introduced to one another at one of those gatherings where one feels the need to converse, no matter on what subject, and where moreover one is instinctively well disposed towards strangers, for instance in a funeral procession on its way to the cemetery), finding that they have the same name, will seek with a mutual friendliness though without success to discover a possible connexion. But that is only an exception. Plenty of people are of dubious character, but we either know nothing or care nothing about them. If, however, a similarity of names brings to our door letters addressed to them, or vice versa, we at once feel a mistrust, often justified, as to their moral worth. We are afraid of being confused with them, we forestall the mistake by a grimace of disgust when anyone refers to them in our hearing. When we read our own name, as borne by them, in the newspaper, they seem to have usurped it. The transgressions of other members of the social organism leave us cold. We lay the burden of them more heavily upon our namesakes. The hatred which we bear towards the other Simonnets is all the stronger in that it is not a personal feeling but has been transmitted by heredity. After the second generation we remember only the expression of disgust with which our grandparents used to refer to the other Simonnets, we know nothing of the reason, we should not be surprised to learn that it had begun with a murder. Until, as is not uncommon, the time comes when a male and female Simonnet, who are not related in any way, are joined together in matrimony and so repair the breach\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only did Albertine speak to me of Robert Forestier and Suzanne Delage, but spontaneously, with that impulse to confide which the approximation of two human bodies creates, that is to say at first, before it has engendered a special duplicity and reticence in one person towards the other, she told me a story about her own family and one of Andr\u00e9e\u2019s uncles, as to which, at Balbec, she had refused to utter a word; thinking that now she ought not to appear to have any secrets in which I might not share. From this moment, had her dearest friend said anything to her against me, she would have made it her duty to inform me. I insisted upon her going home, and finally she did go, but so ashamed on my account at my discourtesy that she laughed almost as though to apologise for me, as a hostess to whose party you have gone without dressing makes the best of you but is offended nevertheless\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAre you laughing at me?\u201d I inquired\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am not laughing, I am smiling at you,\u201d she replied lovingly. \u201cWhen am I going to see you again?\u201d she went on, as though declining to admit that what had just happened between us, since it is generally the crowning consummation, might not be at least the prelude to a great friendship, a friendship already existing which we should have to discover, to confess, and which alone could account for the surrender we had made of ourselves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSince you give me leave, I shall send for you when I can.\u201d I dared not let her know that I was subordinating everything else to the chance of seeing Mme. de Stermaria. \u201cIt will have to be at short notice, unfortunately,\u201d I went on, \u201cI never know beforehand. Would it be possible for me to send round for you in the evenings, when I am free?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt will be quite possible in a little while, I am going to have a latch-key of my own. But just at present it can\u2019t be done. Anyhow I shall come round to-morrow or next day in the afternoon. You needn\u2019t see me if you\u2019re busy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On reaching the door, surprised that I had not anticipated her, she offered me her cheek, feeling that there was no need now for any coarse physical desire to prompt us to kiss one another. The brief relations in which we had just indulged being of the sort to which an absolute intimacy and a heartfelt choice often tend, Albertine had felt it incumbent upon her to improvise and add provisionally to the kisses which we had exchanged on my bed the sentiment of which those kisses would have been the symbol for a knight and his lady such as they might have been conceived in the mind of a gothic minstrel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When she had left me, this young Picard, who might have been carved on his porch by the image-maker of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, Fran\u00e7oise brought me a letter which filled me with joy, for it was from Mme. de Stermaria, who accepted my invitation to dinner. From Mme. de Stermaria, that was to say for me not so much from the real Mme. de Stermaria as from her of whom I had been thinking all day before Albertine\u2019s arrival. It is the terrible deception of love that it begins by engaging us in play not with a woman of the external world but with a puppet fashioned and kept in our brain, the only form of her moreover that we have always at our disposal, the only one that we shall ever possess, one which the arbitrary power of memory, almost as absolute as that of imagination, may have made as different from the real woman as had been from the real Balbec the Balbec of my dreams; an artificial creation to which by degrees, and to our own hurt, we shall force the real woman into resemblance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine had made me so late that the play had just finished when I entered Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room; and having little desire to be caught in the stream of guests who were pouring out, discussing the great piece of news, the separation, said to be already effected, of the Duc de Guermantes from his wife, I had, until I should have an opportunity of shaking hands with my hostess, taken my seat on an empty sofa in the outer room, when from the other, in which she had no doubt had her chair in the very front row of all, I saw emerging, majestic, ample and tall in a flowing gown of yellow satin upon which stood out in relief huge black poppies, the Duchess herself. The sight of her no longer disturbed me in the least. There had been a day when, laying her hands on my forehead (as was her habit when she was afraid of hurting my feelings) and saying: \u201cYou really must stop hanging about trying to meet Mme. de Guermantes. All the neighbours are talking about you. Besides, look how ill your grandmother is, you really have something more serious to think about than waylaying a woman who only laughs at you,\u201d in a moment, like a hypnotist who brings one back from the distant country in which one imagined oneself to be, and opens one\u2019s eyes for one, or like the doctor who, by recalling one to a sense of duty and reality, cures one of an imaginary disease in which one has been indulging one\u2019s fancy, my mother had awakened me from an unduly protracted dream. The rest of the day had been consecrated to a last farewell to this malady which I was renouncing; I had sung, for hours on end and weeping as I sang, the sad words of Schubert\u2019s Adieu:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Farewell, strange voices call thee\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Away from me, dear sister of the angels\n\nAnd then it had finished. I had given up my morning walks, and with so little difficulty that I thought myself justified in the prophecy (which we shall see was to prove false later on) that I should easily grow accustomed in the course of my life to ceasing to see a woman. And when, shortly afterwards, Fran\u00e7oise had reported to me that Jupien, anxious to enlarge his business, was looking for a shop in the neighbourhood, wishing to find one for him (quite happy, moreover, when strolling along a street which already from my bed I had heard luminously vociferous like a peopled beach, to see behind the raised iron shutters of the dairies the young milk-girls with their white sleeves), I had been able to begin these excursions again. Nor did I feel the slightest constraint; for I was conscious that I was no longer going out with the object of seeing Mme. de Guermantes; much as a married woman who takes endless precautions so long as she has a lover, from the day on which she has broken with him leaves his letters lying about, at the risk of disclosing to her husband an infidelity which ceased to alarm her the moment she ceased to be guilty of it. What troubled me now was the discovery that almost every house sheltered some unhappy person. In one the wife was always in tears because her husband was unfaithful to her. In the next it was the other way about. In another a hardworking mother, beaten black and blue by a drunkard son, was endeavouring to conceal her sufferings from the eyes of the neighbours. Quite half of the human race was in tears. And when I came to know the people who composed it I saw that they were so exasperating that I asked myself whether it might not be the adulterous husband and wife (who were so simply because their lawful happiness had been withheld from them, and shewed themselves charming and faithful to everyone but their respective wife and husband) who were in the right. Presently I ceased to have even the excuse of being useful to Jupien for continuing my morning wanderings. For we learned that the cabinet-maker in our courtyard, whose workrooms were separated from Jupien\u2019s shop only by the flimsiest of partitions, was shortly to be \u2018given notice\u2019 by the Duke\u2019s agent because his hammering made too much noise. Jupien could have hoped for nothing better; the workrooms had a basement for storing timber, which communicated with our cellars. He could keep his coal in this, he could knock down the partition, and would then have a huge shop all in one room. But even without the amusement of house-hunting on his behalf I had continued to go out every day before luncheon, just as Jupien himself, finding the rent that M. de Guermantes was asking him exorbitant, was allowing the premises to be inspected in the hope that,discouraged by his failure to find a tenant, the Duke would resign himself to accepting a lower offer. Fran\u00e7oise, noticing that, even at an hour when no prospective tenant was likely to call, the porter left the door of the empty shop on the latch, scented a trap laid by him to entice the young woman who was engaged to the Guer \u2014 mantes footman (they would find a lovers\u2019 retreat there) and to catch them red-handed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However that might be, and for all that I had no longer to find Jupien a new shop, I still went out before luncheon. Often, on these excursions, I met M. de Norpois. It would happen that, conversing as he walked with a colleague, he cast at me a glance which after making a thorough scrutiny of my person returned to his companion without his having smiled at me or given me any more sign of recognition than if he had never set eyes on me before. For, with these eminent diplomats, looking at you in a certain way is intended to let you know not that they have seen you but that they have not seen you and that they have some serious question to discuss with the colleague who is accompanying them. A tall woman whom I frequently encountered near the house was less discreet with me. For in spite of the fact that I did not know her, she would turn round to look at me, would wait for me, unavailingly, before shop windows, smile at me as though she were going to kiss me, make gestures indicative of a complete surrender. She resumed an icy coldness towards me if anyone appeared whom she knew. For a long time now in these morning walks, thinking only of what I had to do, were it but the most trivial purchase of a newspaper, I had chosen the shortest way, with no regret were it outside the ordinary course which the Duchess followed in her walks, and if on the other hand it lay along that course, without either compunction or concealment, because it no longer appeared to me the forbidden way on which I should snatch from an ungrateful woman the favour of setting eyes on her against her will. But it had never occurred to me that my recovery, when it restored me to a normal attitude towards Mme. de Guermantes, would have a corresponding effect on her, and so render possible a friendliness, even a friendship in which I no longer felt any interest. Until then, the efforts of the entire world banded together to bring me into touch with her would have been powerless to counteract the evil spell that is cast by an ill-starred love. Fairies more powerful than mankind have decreed that in such cases nothing can avail us until the day on which we have uttered sincerely and from our hearts the formula: \u201cI am no longer in love.\u201d I had been vexed with Saint-Loup for not having taken me to see his aunt. But he was no more capable than anyone else of breaking an enchantment. So long as I was in love with Mme. de Guermantes, the marks of politeness that \u00ef received from others, their compliments actually distressed me, not only because they did not come from her but because she would never hear of them. And yet even if she had known of them it would not have been of the slightest use to me. Indeed, among the lesser auxiliaries to success in iove, an absence, the declining of an invitation to dinner, an unintentional, unconscious harshness are of more service than all the cosmetics and fine clothes in the world. There would be plenty of social success, were people taught upon these lines the art of succeeding\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she swept through the room in which I was sitting, her mind filled with thoughts of friends whom I did not know and whom she would perhaps be meeting presently at some other party, Mme. de Guermantes caught sight of me on my sofa, genuinely indifferent and seeking only to be polite whereas while I was in love I had tried so desperately, without ever succeeding, to assume an air of indifference; she swerved aside, came towards me and, reproducing the smile she had worn that evening at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, which the unpleasant feeling of being cared for by some one for whom she did not care was no longer there to obliterate: \u201cNo, don\u2019t move; you don\u2019t mind if I sit down beside you for a moment?\u201d she asked, gracefully gathering in her immense skirt which otherwise would have covered the entire sofa\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of less stature than she, who was further expanded by the volume of her gown, I was almost brushed by her exquisite bare arm round which a faint, innumerable down rose in perpetual smoke like a golden mist, and by the fringe of her fair tresses which wafted their fragrance over me. Having barely room to sit down, she could not turn easily to face me, and so obliged to look straight before her rather than in my direction, assumed the sort of dreamy, sweet expression one sees in a portrait\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you any news of Robert?\u201d she inquired\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment Mme. de Villeparisis entered the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, Sir, you arrive at a fine time, when we do see you here for once in a way!\u201d And noticing that I was talking to her niece, concluding, perhaps, that we were more intimate than she had supposed: \u201cBut don\u2019t let me interrupt your conversation with Oriane,\u201d she went on, and (for these good offices as pander are part of the duties of the perfect hostess): \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t care to dine with her here on Thursday?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was the day on which I was to entertain Mme. de Stermaria, so I declined\n\u201cSaturday, then?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As my mother was returning on Saturday or Sunday, it would never do for me not to stay at home every evening to dine with her; I therefore declined this invitation also\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, you\u2019re not an easy person to get hold of.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy do you never come to see me?\u201d inquired Mme. de Guermantes when Mme. de Villeparisis had left us to go and congratulate the performers and present the leading lady with a bunch of roses upon which the hand that offered it conferred all its value, for it had cost no more than twenty francs. (This, incidentally, was as high as she ever went when an artist had performed only once. Those who gave their services at all her afternoons and evenings throughout the season received roses painted by the Marquise.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s such a bore that we never see each other except in other people\u2019s houses. Since you won\u2019t meet me at dinner at my aunt\u2019s, why not come and dine with me?\u201d Various people who had stayed to the last possible moment, upon one pretext or another, but were at length preparing to leave, seeing that the Duchess had sat down to talk to a young man on a seat so narrow as just to contain them both, thought that they must have been misinformed, that it was the Duchess, and not the Duke, who was seeking a separation, and on my account. Whereupon they hastened to spread abroad this intelligence. I had better grounds than anyone to be aware of its falsehood. But I was myself surprised that at one of those difficult periods in which a separation that is not yet completed is beginning to take effect, the Duchess, instead of withdrawing from society should go out of her way to invite a \u2014 person whom she knew so slightly. The suspicion crossed my mind that it had been the Duke alone who had been opposed to her having me in the house, and that now that he was leaving her she saw no further obstacle to her surrounding herself with the people that she liked\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A minute earlier I should have been stupefied had anyone told me that Mme. de Guermantes was going to ask me to call on her, let alone to dine with her. I might be perfectly aware that the Guermantes drawing-room could not furnish those particular refinements which I had extracted from the name of its occupants, the fact that it had been forbidden ground to me, by obliging me to give it the same kind of existence that we give to the drawing-rooms of which we have read the description in a novel, or seen the image in a dream, made me, even when I was certain that it was just like any other, imagine it as quite different. Between myself and it was the barrier at which reality ends. To dine with the Guermantes was like travelling to a place I had long wished to see, making a desire emerge from my brain and take shape before my eyes, forming acquaintance with a dream. At the most, I might have supposed that it would be one of those dinners to which one\u2019s hosts invite one with: \u201cDo come; there\u2019ll beabsolutely nobody but ourselves,\u201d pretending to attribute to the pariah the alarm which they themselves feel at the thought of his mixing with their other friends, seeking indeed to convert into an enviable privilege, reserved for their intimates alone, the quarantine of the outsider, hopelessly uncouth, whom they are befriending. I felt on the contrary that Mme. de Guermantes was anxious for me to enjoy the most delightful society that she had to offer me when she went on, projecting as she spoke before my eyes as it were the violet-hued loveliness of a visit to Fabrice\u2019s aunt with the miracle of an introduction to Count Mosca:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOn Friday, now, couldn\u2019t you? There are just a few people coming; the Princesse de Parme, who is charming, not that I\u2019d ask you to meet anyone who wasn\u2019t nice.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Discarded in the intermediate social grades which are engaged in a perpetual upward movement, the family still plays an important part in certain stationary grades, such as the lower middle class and the semi-royal aristocracy, which latter cannot seek to raise itself since above it, from its own special point of view, there exists nothing higher. The friendship shewn me by her \u2018aunt Villeparisis\u2019 and Robert had perhaps made me, for Mme. de Guermantes and her friends, living always upon themselves and in the same little circle, the object of a curious interest of which I had no suspicion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had of those two relatives a familiar, everyday, homely knowledge, of a sort, utterly different from what we imagine, in which if we happen to be comprised in it, so far from our actions being at once ejected, like the grain of dust from the eye or the drop of water from the windpipe, they are capable of remaining engraved, and will still be related and discussed years after we ourselves have forgotten them, in the palace in which we are astonished to find them preserved, like a letter in our own handwriting among a priceless collection of autographs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People who are merely fashionable may set a guard upon doors which are too freely invalided. But the Guermantes door was not that. Hardly ever did a stranger have occasion to pass by it. If, for once in a way, the Duchess had one pointed out to her, she never dreamed of troubling herself about the social increment that he would bring, since this was a thing that she conferred and could not receive. She thought only of his real merits. Both Mme. de Villeparisis and Saint-Loup had testified to mine Doubtless she might not have believed them if she had not at the same time observed that they could never manage to secure me when they wanted me, and therefore that I attached no importance to worldly things, which seemed to the Duchess a sign that the stranger was to be numbered among what she called \u2018nice people.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was worth seeing, when one spoke to her of women for whom she did not care, how her face changed as soon as one named, in connexion with one of these, let us say, her sister-in-law. \u201cOh, she is charming!\u201d the Duchess would exclaim in a judicious, confident tone. The only reason that she gave was that this lady had declined to be introduced to the Marquise de Chaussegros and the Princesse de Silistrie. She did not add that the lady had declined also an introduction to herself, the Duchesse de Guermantes. This had, nevertheless, been the case, and ever since the mind of the Duchess had been at work trying to unravel the motives of a woman who was so hard to know, she was dying to be invited to call on her. People in society are so accustomed to be sought after that the person who shuns them seems to them a phoenix and at once monopolises their attention. Was the true motive in the mind of Mme. de Guermantes for thus inviting me (now that I was no longer in love with her) that I did not run after her relatives, although apparently run after myself by them? I cannot say. In any case, having made up her mind to invite me, she was anxious to do me the honours of the best company at her disposal and to keep away those of her friends whose presence might have dissuaded me from coming again, those whom she knew to be boring. I had not known to what to attribute her change of direction, when I had seen her deviate from her stellar path, come to sit down beside me and had heard her invite me to dinner, the effect of causes unknown for want of a special sense to enlighten us in this respect. We picture to ourselves the people who know us but slightly \u2014 such as, in my case, the Duchesse de Guermantes \u2014 as thinking of us only at the rare moments at which they set eyes on us. As a matter of fact this ideal oblivion in which we picture them as holding us is a purely arbitrary conception on our part. So that while, in our solitary silence, like that of a cloudless night, we imagine the various queens of society pursuing their course in the heavens at an infinite distance, we cannot help an involuntary start of dismay or pleasure if there falls upon us from that starry height, like a meteorite engraved with our name which we supposed to be unknown on Venus or Cassiopeia, an invitation to dinner or a piece of malicious gossip\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps now and then when, following the example of the Persian princes who, according to the Book of Esther, made their scribes read out to them the registers in which were enrolled the names of those of their subjects who had shewn zeal in their service, Mme. de Guermantes consulted her list of the well-disposed, she had said to herself, on coming to my name: \u201cA man we must ask to dine some day.\u201d But other thoughts had distracted her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Beset by surging cares, a Prince\u2019s mind\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Towards fresh matters ever is inclined)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0until the moment when she had caught sight of me sitting alone like Mordecai at the palace gate; and, the sight of me having refreshed her memory, sought, like Ahasuerus, to lavish her gifts upon me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I must at the same time add that a surprise of a totally different sort was to follow that which I had felt on hearing Mme. de Guermantes ask me to dine with her. Since I had decided that it would shew greater modesty, on my part, and gratitude also not to conceal this initial surprise, but rather to exaggerate my expression of the delight that it gave me, Mme. de Guermantes, who was getting ready to go on to another, final party, had said to me, almost as a justification and for fear of my not being quite certain who she was, since I appeared so astonished at being invited to dine with her: \u201cYou know I\u2019m the aunt of Robert de Saint-Loup, who is such a friend of yours; besides we have met before.\u201d In replying that I was aware of this I added that I knew also M. de Charlus, \u201cwho had been very good to me at Balbec and in Paris.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes appeared dumbfoundered, and her eyes seemed to turn, as though for a verification of this statement, to some page, already filled and turned, of her internal register of events. \u201cWhat, so you know Palam\u00e8de, do you?\u201d This name assumed on the lips of Mme. de Guermantes a great charm, due to the instinctive simplicity with which she spoke of a man who was socially so brilliant a figure, but for her was no more than her brother-in-law and the cousin with whom she had grown up. And on the confused greyness which the life of the Duchesse de Guermantes was for me this name, Palam\u00e8de, shed as it were the radiance of long summer days on which she had played with him as a girl, at Guermantes, in the garden. Moreover, in this long outgrown period in their lives, Oriane de Guermantes and her cousin Palam\u00e8de had been very different from what they had since become; M. de Charlus in particular, entirely absorbed in the artistic pursuits from which he had so effectively restrained himself in later life that I was stupefied to learn that it was he who had painted the huge fan with black and yellow irises which the Duchess was at this moment unfurling. She could also have shewn me a little sonatina which he had once composed for her. I was completely unaware that the Baron possessed all these talents, of which he never spoke. Let me remark in passing that M. de Charlus did not at all relish being called \u2018Palam\u00e8de\u2019 by his family. That the form \u2018M\u00e9m\u00e9\u2019 might not please him one could easily understand. These stupid abbreviations are a sign of the utter inability of the aristocracy to appreciate its own Poetic beauty (in Jewry, too, we may see the same defect, since a nephew of Lady Israels, whose name was Moses, was commonly known as \u2018Momo\u2019) concurrently with its anxiety not to appear to attach any importance to what is aristocratic. Now M. de Charlus had, in this connexion, a greater wealth of poetic imagination and a more blatant pride. But the reason for his distaste for \u2018M\u00e9m\u00e9\u2019 could not be this, since it extended also to the fine name Palam\u00e8de. The truth was that, considering, knowing himself to come of a princely stock, he would have liked his brother and sister-in-law to refer to him as \u2018Charlus,\u2019 just as Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie and Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans might have spoken of their sons and grandsons, brothers and nephews as \u2018Joinville, Nemours, Chartres, Paris.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a humbug M\u00e9m\u00e9 is!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWe talked to him about you for hours; he told us that he would be delighted to make your acquaintance, just as if he had never set eyes on you. You must admit he\u2019s odd, and \u2014 though it\u2019s not very nice of me to say such a thing about a brother-in-law I\u2019m devoted to, and really do admire immensely \u2014 a trifle mad at times.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was struck by the application of this last epithet to M. de Charlus, and said to myself that this half-madness might perhaps account for certain things, such as his having appeared so delighted by his own proposal that I should ask Bloch to castigate his mother. I decided that, by reason not only of the things he said but of the way in which he said them, M. de Charlus must be a little mad. The first time that one listens to a barrister or an actor, one is surprised by his tone, so different from the conversational. But, observing that everyone else seems to find this quite natural, one says nothing about it to other people, one says nothing in fact to oneself, one is content with appreciating the degree of talent shewn. At the most, one may think, of an actor at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais: \u201cWhy, instead of letting his raised arm fall naturally, did he make it drop in a series of little jerks broken by pauses for at least ten minutes?\u201d or of a Labori: \u201cWhy, whenever he opened his mouth, did he utter those tragic, unexpected sounds to express the simplest things?\u201d But as everybody admits these actions to be necessary and obvious one is not shocked by them. So, upon thinking it over, one said to oneself that M. de Charlus spoke of himself with undue emphasis in a tone which was not in the least that of ordinary speech. It seemed as though one might have at any moment interrupted him with: \u201cBut why do you shout so? Why are you so offensive?\u201d only everyone seemed to have tacitly agreed that it was all right. And one took one\u2019s place in the circle which applauded his outbursts. But certainly, at certain moments, a stranger might have thought that he was listening to the ravings of a maniac\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut are you sure you\u2019re not thinking of some one else? Do you really mean my brother-in-law Palam\u00e8de?\u201d went on the Duchess, a trace of impertinence grafted upon her natural simplicity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I replied that I was absolutely sure, and that M. de Charlus must have failed to catch my name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh well! I shall leave you now,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, as though she regretted the parting. \u201cI must look in for a moment at the Princesse de Ligne\u2019s. You aren\u2019t going on there? No? You don\u2019t care for parties? You\u2019re very wise, they are too boring for words. If only I hadn\u2019t got to go. But she\u2019s my cousin; it wouldn\u2019t be polite. I am sorry, selfishly, for my own sake, because I could have taken you there, and brought you back afterwards, too. So I shall say good-bye now, and look forward to Friday.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That M. de Charlus should have blushed to be seen with me by M. d\u2019Argencourt was all very well. But that to his own sister-in-law, who had so high an opinion of him besides, he should deny all knowledge of me, knowledge which was perfectly natural seeing that I was a friend of both his aunt and his nephew, was a thing that I could not understand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I shall end my account of this incident with the remark that from one point of view there was in Mme. de Guermantes a true greatness which consisted in her entirely obliterating from her memory what other people would have only partially forgotten. Had she never seen me waylaying her, following her, tracking her down as she took her morning walks, had she never responded to my daily salute with an angry impatience, had she never refused Saint-Loup when he begged her to invite me to her house, she could not have greeted me now in a nobler or more gracious manner. Not only did she waste no time in retrospective explanations, in hints, allusions or ambiguous smiles, not only was there in her present affability, without any harking back to the past, without any reticence, something as proudly rectilinear as her majestic stature, but the resentment which she might have felt against anyone in the past was so entirely reduced to ashes, the ashes were themselves cast so utterly from her memory, or at least from her manner, that on studying her face whenever she had occasion to treat with the most exquisite simplification what in so many other people would have been a pretext for reviving stale antipathies and recriminations one had the impression of an intense purity of mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if I was surprised by the modification that had occurred in her opinion of me, how much more did it surprise me to find a similar but ever so much greater change in my feeling for her. Had there not been a time during which I could regain life and strength only if \u2014 always building new castles in the air! \u2014 I had found some one who would obtain for me an invitation to her house and, after this initial boon, would procure many others for my increasingly exacting heart? It was the impossibility of finding any avenue there that had made me leave Paris for Donci\u00e8res to visit Robert de Saint-Loup. And now it was indeed by the consequence of a letter from him that I was agitated, but on account this time of Mme. de Stermaria, not of Mme. de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let me add further, to conclude my account of this party, that there Occurred at it an incident, contradicted a few days later, which continued to puzzle me, interrupted for some time my friendship with Bloch, and constitutes in itself one of those curious paradoxes the explanation of which will be found in the next part of this work. At this party at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, Bloch kept on boasting to me about the friendly attentions shewn him by M. de Charlus, who, when he passed him in the street, looked him straight in the face as though he recognised him, was anxious to know him personally, knew quite well who he was. I smiled at first, Bloch having expressed so vehemently at Balbec his contempt for the said M. de Charlus. And I supposed merely that Bloch, like his father in the Case of Bergotte, knew the Baron \u2018without actually knowing him,\u2019 and that what he took for a friendly glance was due to absent-mindedness. But finally Bloch became so precise and appeared so confident that on two or three occasions M. de Charlus had wished to address him that, remembering that I had spoken of my friend to the Baron, who had, as we walked away together from this very house, as it happened, asked me various questions about him, I came to the conclusion that Bloch was not lying that M. de Charlus had heard his name, realised that he was my friend\u2019 and so forth. And so, a little later, at the theatre one evening, I asked M! de Charlus if I might introduce Bloch to him, and, on his assenting, went in search of my friend. But as soon as M. de Charlus caught sight of him an expression of astonishment, instantly repressed, appeared on his face where it gave way to a blazing fury. Not only did he not offer Bloch his hand but whenever Bloch spoke to him he replied in the most insolent manner, in an angry and wounding tone. So that Bloch, who, according to his version, had received nothing until then from the Baron but smiles, assumed that I had not indeed commended but disparaged him in the short speech in which, knowing M. de Charlus\u2019s liking for formal procedure, I had told him about my friend before bringing him up to be introduced. Bloch left us, his spirit broken, like a man who has been trying to mount a horse which is always ready to take the bit in its teeth, or to swim against waves which continually dash him back on the shingle, and did not speak to me again for six months\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The days that preceded my dinner with Mme. de Stermaria were for me by no means delightful, in fact it was all I could do to live through them. For as a general rule, the shorter the interval is that separates us from our planned objective, the longer it seems to us, because we apply to it a more minute scale of measurement, or simply because it occurs to us to measure it at all. The Papacy, we are told, reckons by centuries, and indeed may not think perhaps of reckoning time at all, since its goal is in eternity. Mine was no more than three days off; I counted by seconds, I gave myself up to those imaginings which are the first movements of caresses, of caresses which it maddens us not to be able to make the woman herself reciprocate and complete \u2014 those identical caresses, to the exclusion of all others. And, as a matter of fact, it is true that, generally speaking, the difficulty of attaining to the object of a desire enhances that desire (the difficulty, not the impossibility, for that suppresses it altogether), yet in the case of a desire that is wholly physical the certainty that it will be realised, at a fixed and not distant point in time, is scarcely less exciting than uncertainty; almost as much as an anxious doubt, the absence of doubt makes intolerable the period of waiting for the pleasure that is bound to come, because it makes of that suspense an innumerably rehearsed accomplishment and by the frequency of our proleptic representations divides time into sections as minute as could be carved by agony. What I required was to possess Mme. de Stermaria, for during the last few days, with an incessant activity, my desires had been preparing this pleasure, in my imagination, and this pleasure alone, for any other kind (pleasure, that is, taken with another woman) would not have been ready, pleasure being but the realisation of a previous wish, and of one which is not always the same, but changes according to the endless combinations of one\u2019s fancies, the accidents of one\u2019s memory, the state of one\u2019s temperament, the variability of one\u2019s desires, the most recently granted of which lie dormant until the disappointment of their satisfaction has been to some extent forgotten; I should not have been prepared, I had already turned from the main road of general desires and had ventured along the bridle-path of a particular desire; I should have had \u2014 in order to wish for a different assignation \u2014 to retrace my steps too far before rejoining the main road and taking another path. To take possession of Mme. de Stermaria on the island in the Bois de Boulogne where I had asked her to dine with me, this was the pleasure that I imagined to myself afresh every moment. It would have automatically perished if I had dined on that island without Mme. de Stermaria; but perhaps as greatly diminished had I dined, even with her, somewhere else. Besides, the attitudes in which one pictures a pleasure to oneself exist previously to the woman, to the type of woman required to give one that pleasure. They dictate the pleasure, and the place as well, and on that account bring to the fore alternatively, in our capricious fancy, this or that woman, this or that scene, this or that room, which in other weeks we should have dismissed with contempt. Child of the attitude that produced her, one woman will not appeal to us without the large bed in which we find peace by her side, while others, to be caressed with a more secret intention, require leaves blown by the wind, water rippling in the night, are as frail and fleeting as they\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt in the past, long before I received Saint-Loup\u2019s letter and when there was as yet no question of Mme. de Stermaria, the island in the Bois had seemed to me to be specially designed for pleasure, because I had found myself going there to taste the bitterness of having no pleasure to enjoy in its shelter. It is to the shores of the lake from which one goes to that island, and along which, in the last weeks of summer, those ladies of Paris who have not yet left for the country take the air, that, not knowing where to look for her, or if indeed she has not already left Paris, one wanders in the hope of seeing the girl go by with whom one fell in love at the last ball of the season, whom one will not have a chance of meeting again in any drawing-room until the following spring. Feeling it to be at least the eve, if not the morrow, of the beloved\u2019s departure, one follows along the brink of the shivering water those attractive paths by which already a first red leaf is blooming like a last rose, one scans that horizon where, by a device the opposite of that employed in those panoramas beneath whose domed roofs the wax figures in the foreground impart to the painted canvas beyond them the illusory appearance of depth and mass, our eyes, passing without any transition from the cultivated park to the natural heights of Meudon and the Mont Val\u00e9rien, do not know where to set the boundary, and make the natural country trespass upon the handiwork of the gardener, of which they project far beyond its own limits the artificial charm; like those rare birds reared in the open in a botanical garden which every day in the liberty of their winged excursions sally forth to strike, among the surrounding woods, an exotic note. Between the last festivity of summer and one\u2019s winter exile, one ranges anxiously that romantic world of chance encounters and lover\u2019s melancholy, and one would be no more surprised to learn that it was situated outside the mapped universe than if, at Versailles, looking down from the terrace, an observatory round which the clouds are massed against a blue sky in the manner of Van der Meulen, after having thus risen above the bounds of nature, one were informed that, there where nature begins again at the end of the great canal, the villages which one just could not make out, on a horizon as dazzling as the sea, were called Fleurus or Nim\u00e8gue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, the last carriage having rolled by, when one feels with a throb of pain that she will not come now, one goes to dine on the island; above the shivering poplars which suggest endless mysteries of evening though without response, a pink cloud paints a last touch of life in the tranquil sky. A few drops of rain fall without noise on the water, ancient but still in its diyine infancy coloured always by the weather and continually forgetting the reflexions of clouds and flowers. And after the geraniums have vainly striven, by intensifying the brilliance of their scarlet, to resist the gathering darkness, a mist rises to envelop the now slumbering island; one walks in the moist dimness along the water\u2019s edge, where at the most the silent passage of a swan startles one like, in a bed, at night, the eyes, for a moment wide open, and the swift smile of a child whom one did not suppose to be awake. Then one would like to have with one a loving companion, all the more as one feels oneself to be alone and can imagine oneself to be far away from the world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But to this island, where even in summer there was often a mist, how much more gladly would I have brought Mme. de Stermaria now that the cold season, the back end of autumn had come. If the weather that had prevailed since Sunday had not by itself rendered grey and maritime the scenes in which my imagination was living \u2014 as other seasons made them balmy, luminous, Italian \u2014 the hope of, in a few days\u2019 time, making Mme. de Stermaria mine would have been quite enough to raise, twenty times in an hour, a curtain of mist in my monotonously lovesick imagination. In any event the mist, which since yesterday had risen even in Paris, not only made me think incessantly of the native place of the young woman whom I had invited to dine with me, but, since it was probable that, far more thickly than in the streets of the town, it must after sunset be invading the Bois, especially the shores of the lake, I thought that it would make the Swans\u2019 Island, for me, something like that Breton island the marine and misty atmosphere of which had always enwrapped in my mind like a garment the pale outline of Mme. de Stermaria. Of course when we are young, at the age I had reached at the period of my walks along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, our desires, our faith bestow on a woman\u2019s clothing an individual personality, an ultimate quintessence. We pursue reality. But by dint of allowing it to escape we end by noticing that, after all those vain endeavours which have led to nothing, something solid subsists, which is what we have been seeking. We begin to separate, to recognise what we love, we try to procure it for ourselves, be it only by a stratagem. Then, in the absence of our vanished faith, costume fills the gap, by means of a deliberate illusion. I knew quite well that within half an hour of home I should not find myself in Brittany. But in walking arm in arm with Mme. de Stermaria in the dusk of the island, by the water\u2019s edge, I should be acting like other men who, unable to penetrate the walls of \u00e0 convent, do at least, before enjoying a woman, clothe her in the habit of a nun\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could even look forward to hearing, as I sat with the lady, the lapping of waves, for, on the day before our dinner, a storm broke over Paris. I was beginning to shave myself before going to the island to engage the room (albeit at this time of year the island was empty and the restaurant deserted) and order the food for our dinner next day when Fran\u00e7oise came in to tell me that Albertine had called. I made her come in at once, indifferent to her finding me disfigured by a bristling chin, her for whom at Balbec I had never felt smart enough and who had cost me then as much agitation and distress as Mme. de Stermaria was costing me now. The latter, I was determined, must go away with the best possible impression from our evening together. Accordingly I asked Albertine to come with me there and then to the island to order the food. She to whom one gives everything is so quickly replaced by another that one is surprised to find oneself giving all that one has, afresh, at every moment, without any hope of future reward. At my suggestion the smiling rosy face beneath Albertine\u2019s flat cap, which came down very low, to her eyebrows, seemed to hesitate. She had probably other plans; if so she sacrificed them willingly, to my great satisfaction, for I attached the utmost importance to my having with me a young housewife who would know a great deal more than myself about ordering dinner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is quite true that she had represented something utterly different for me at Balbec. But our intimacy, even when we do not consider it close enough at the time, with a woman with whom we are in love creates between her and us, in spite of the shortcomings that pain us while our love lasts, social ties which outlast our love and even the memory of our love. Then, in her who is nothing more for us than a means of approach, an avenue towards others, we are just as astonished and amused to learn from our memory what her name meant originally to that other creature which we then were as if, after giving a cabman an address in the Boulevard des Capucines or the Rue du Bac, thinking only of the person whom we are going to see there, we remind ourself that the names were once those of, respectively, the Capuchin nuns whose convent stood on the site and the ferry across the Seine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, my Balbec desires had so generously ripened Albertine\u2019s body, had gathered and stored in it savours so fresh and sweet that, as we drove through the Bois, while the wind like a careful gardener shook the trees, brought down the fruit, swept up the fallen leaves, I said to myself that had there been any risk of Saint-Loup\u2019s being mistaken, or of my having misunderstood his letter, so that my dinner with Mme. de Stermaria might lead to no satisfactory result, I should have made an appointment for the same evening, later on, with Albertine, so as to forget, for a purely voluptuous hour, as I held in my arms a body of which my curiosity had long since computed, weighed up all the possible charms in which now it abounded, the emotions and perhaps the regrets of this first phase of love for Mme. de Stermaria. And certainly if I could have supposed that Mme de Stermaria would not grant me any of her favours at our first meeting, I should have formed a slightly depressing picture of my evening with her. I knew too well from experience how the two stages which occur in us in the first phase of our love for a woman whom we have desired without knowing her, loving in her rather the particular kind of existence in which she is steeped than her still unfamiliar self \u2014 how distorted is the reflexion of those two stages in the world of facts, that is to say not in ourselves any longer but in our meetings with her. We have, without ever having talked to her, hesitated, tempted as we were by the poetic charm which she represented for us. Shall it be this woman or another? And lo, our dreams become fixed round about her, cease to have any separate existence from her. The first meeting with her which will shortly follow should reflect this dawning love. Nothing of the sort. As if it were necessary that our material life should have its first period also, in love with her already, we talk to her in the most trivial fashion: \u201cI asked you to dine on this island because I thought the surroundings would amuse you. I\u2019ve nothing particular to say to you, don\u2019t you know. But it\u2019s rather damp, I\u2019m afraid, and you may find it cold \u2014\u201d \u201cOh, no, not at all!\u201d \u201cYou just say that out of politeness. Very well, Madame, I shall allow you to battle against the cold for another quarter of an hour, as I don\u2019t want to bother you, but in fifteen minutes I shall carry you off by force. I don\u2019t want to have you catching a chill.\u201d And without another word said we take her home, remembering nothing about her, at the most a certain look in her eyes, but thinking only of seeing her again. Well, at our second meeting (when we do not find even that look, our sole memory of her, but nevertheless have been thinking only of seeing her again), the first stage is passed. Nothing has happened in the interval. And yet, instead of talking about the comfort or want of comfort of the restaurant, we say, without our words appearing to surprise the new person, who seems to us positively plain but to whom we should like to think that people were talking about us at every moment in her life: \u201cWe are going to have our work cut out to overcome all the obstacles in our way. Do you think we shall be successful? Do you suppose that we can triumph over our enemies \u2014 live happily ever afterwards, and all that sort of thing?\u201d But these conversational openings, trivial to begin with, then hinting at love, would not be required; I could trust Saint-Loup\u2019s letter for that. Mme. de Stermaria would yield herself to me from the first, I should have no need therefore to engage Albertine to come to me, as a makeshift, later in the evening. It would be superfluous; Robert never exaggerated, and his letter was explicit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Albertine spoke hardly at all, conscious that my thoughts were elsewhere. We went a little way on foot into the greenish, almost submarine grotto of a dense mass of trees, on the domed tops of which we heard the wind sweep and the rain pelt. I trod underfoot dead leaves which, like shells, were trampled into the soil, and poked with my stick at fallen chestnuts prickly as sea-urchins\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the boughs the last clinging leaves, shaken by the wind, followed it only as far as their stems would allow, but sometimes these broke, and they fell to the ground, along which they coursed to overtake it. I thought with joy how much more remote still, if this weather lasted, the island would be on the morrow \u2014 and in any case quite deserted. We returned to our carriage and, as the storm had passed off, Albertine asked me to take her on to Saint-Cloud. As on the ground the drifting leaves so up above the clouds were chasing the wind. And a stream of migrant evenings, of which a sort of conic section cut through the sky made visible the successive layers, pink, blue and green, were gathered in readiness for departure to warmer climes. To obtain a closer view of a marble goddess who had been carved in the act of leaping from her pedestal and, alone in a great wood which seemed to be consecrated to her, filled it with the mythological terror, half animal, half divine, of her frenzied bounding, Albertine climbed a grassy slope while I waited for her in the road. She herself, seen thus from below, no longer coarse and plump as, a few days earlier, on my bed when the grain of her throat became apparent in the lens of my eye as it approached her person, but chiselled and delicate, seemed a little statue on which our happy hours together at Balbec had left their patina. When I found myself alone again at home, and remembered that I had taken a drive that afternoon with Albertine, that I was to dine in two days\u2019 time with Mme. de Guermantes and that I had to answer a letter from Gilberte, three women each of whom I had once loved, I said to myself that our social existence is, like an artist\u2019s studio, filled with abandoned sketches in which we have fancied for a moment that we could set down in permanent form our need of a great love, but it did not occur to me that sometimes, if the sketch be not too old, it may happen that we return to it and make of it a work wholly different, and possibly more important than what we had originally planned\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next day was cold and fine; winter was in the air \u2014 indeed the season was so far advanced that it had seemed miraculous that we should find in the already pillaged Bois a few domes of gilded green. When I awoke I saw, as from the window of the barracks at Donci\u00e8res, a uniform, dead white mist which hung gaily in the sunlight, consistent and sweet as a web of spun sugar. Then the sun withdrew, and the mist thickened still further in the afternoon. Night fell early, I made ready for dinner, but it was still too soon to start; I decided to send a carriage for Mme. de Stermaria. I did not like to go for her in it myself, not wishing to force my company on her, but I gave the driver a note for her in which I asked whether she would mind my coming to call for her. While I waited for her answer I lay down on my bed, shut my eyes for a moment, then opened them again. Over the top of the curtains there was nothing now but a thin strip of daylight which grew steadily fainter. I recognised that wasted hour, the large ante-room of pleasure, the dark, delicious emptiness of which I had learned at Balbec to know and to enjoy when, alone in my room as I was now, while all the rest were at dinner, I saw without regret the daylight fade from above my curtains, knowing that, presently, after a night of arctic brevity, it was to be resuscitated in a more dazzling brightness in the lighted rooms of Rivebelle. I sprang from my bed, tied my black necktie, passed a brush over my hair, final gestures of a belated tidying carried out at Balbec with my mind not on myself but on the women whom I should see at Rivebelle while I smiled at them in anticipation in the mirror that stood across a corner of my room, gestures which, on that account, had continued to herald a form of entertainment in which music and lights would be mingled. Like magic signs they summoned, nay rather presented this entertainment already; thanks to them I had, of its intoxicating frivolous charm as complete an enjoyment as I had had at Combray, in the month of July, when I heard the hammer-blows ring on the packing cases and enjoyed, in the coolness of my darkened room, a sense of warmth and sunshine\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also, it was no longer exactly Mme. de Stermaria that I should have wished most to see. Forced now to spend my evening with her, I should have preferred, as it was almost the last before the return of my parents that it should remain free and myself try instead to find some of the women from Rivebelle. I gave my hands one more final wash and, my sense of pleasure keeping me on the move, dried them as I walked through the shuttered dining-room. It appeared to have a door open on to the lighted hall but what I had taken for the bright chink of the door, which as a matter of fact was closed, was only the gleaming reflexion of my towel in a mirror that had been laid against the wall in readiness to be fixed in its place before Mamma\u2019s return. I thought of all the other illusions of the sort which I had discovered in different parts of the house, and which were not optical only, for when we first came there I had supposed that our next-door neighbour kept a dog on account of the continuous, almost human yapping which came from a certain pipe in the kitchen whenever the tap was turned on. And the door on to the outer landing never closed by itself, very gently, caught by a draught on the staircase, without rendering those broken, voluptuous, whimpering passages which sound over the chant of the pilgrims towards the end of Overture to Tannh\u00e4user. I had, moreover, just as I had put my towel back on its rail, an opportunity of hearing a fresh rendering of this brilliant symphonic fragment, for at a peal of the bell I hurried out to open the door to the driver who had come with Mme. de Stermaria\u2019s answer. I thought that his message would be: \u201cThe lady is downstairs,\u201d or \u201cThe lady is waiting.\u201d But he had a letter in his hand. I hesitated for a moment before looking to see what Mme. de Stermaria had written, who, while she held the pen in her hand, might have been anything but was now, detached from herself, an engine of fate, pursuing a course alone, which she was utterly powerless to alter. I asked the driver to wait downstairs for a moment, although he was cursing the fog. As soon as he had gone I opened the envelope. On her card, inscribed Vicomtesse Alix de. Stermaria, my guest had written: \u201cAm so sorry \u2014 am unfortunately prevented from dining with you this evening on the island in the Bois. Had been so looking forward to it. Will write you a proper letter from Stermaria. Very sorry. Kindest regards.\u201d I stood motionless, stunned by the shock that I had received. At my feet lay the card and envelope, fallen like the spent cartridge from a gun when the shot has been fired. I picked them up, tried to analyse her message. \u201cShe says that she cannot dine with me on the island in the Bois. One might gather from that that she would dine with me somewhere else. I shall not be so indiscreet as to go and fetch her, but, after all, that is quite a reasonable interpretation.\u201d And from that island in the Bois, as for the last few days my thoughts had been installed there beforehand with Mme. de Sterm\u00e2ria, I could not succeed in bringing them back to where I was. My desire responded automatically to the gravitational force which had been pulling it now for so many hours on end, and in spite of this message, too recent to counteract that force, I went on instinctively getting ready to start, just as a student, although ploughed by the examiners, tries to answer one question more. At last I decided to tell Fran\u00e7oise to go down and pay the driver. I went along the passage without finding her, I passed through the dining-room, where suddenly my feet ceased to sound on the bare boards as they had been doing and were hushed to a silence which, even before I had realised the explanation of it, gave me a feeling of suffocation and confinement. It was the carpets which, in view of my parents\u2019 return, the servants had begun to put down again, those carpets which look so well on bright mornings when amid their disorder the sun stays and waits for you like a friend come to take you out to luncheon in the country, and casts over them the dappled light and shade of the forest, but which now on the contrary were the first installation of the wintry prison from which, obliged as I should be to live, to take my meals at home, I should no longer be free now to escape when I chose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTake care you don\u2019t slip, Sir; they\u2019re not tacked yet,\u201d Fran\u00e7oise called to me. \u201cI ought to have lighted up. Oh, dear, it\u2019s the end of \u2018Sectember\u2019 already, the fine days are over.\u201d In no time, winter; at the corner of a window, as in a Galle glass, a vein of crusted snow; and even in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, instead of the girls one waits to see, nothing but solitary sparrows\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What added to my distress at not seeing Mme. de Sterm\u00e2ria was that her answer led me to suppose that whereas, hour by hour, since Sunday, I had been living for this dinner alone, she had presumably never given it a second thought. Later on I learned of an absurd love match that she had suddenly made with a young man whom she must already have been seeing at this time, and who had presumably made her forget my invitation. For if she had remembered it she would surely never have waited for the carriage which I was not, for that matter, supposed to be sending for her, to inform me that she was otherwise engaged. My dreams of a young feudal maiden on a misty island had cleared the way to a still non-existent love. Now my disappointment, my rage, my desperate desire to recapture her who had just refused me were able, by bringing my sensibility into play, to make definite the possible love which until then my imagination alone had \u2014 and that more loosely \u2014 offered me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How many are there in our memories, how many more have we forgotten, of these faces of girls and young women, all different, to which we have added a certain charm and a frenzied desire to see them again only because at the last moment they eluded us? In the case of Mme. de Stermaria there was a good deal more than this, and it was enough now to make me love her for me to see her again so that I might refresh those impressions, so vivid but all too brief, which my memory would not, without such refreshment, have the strength to keep alive when we were apart. Circumstances decided against me; I did not see her again. It was not she that I loved, but it might well have been. And one of the things that made most cruel, perhaps, the great love which was presently to come to me was that when I thought of this evening I used to say to myself that my love might, given a slight modification of very ordinary circumstances, have been directed elsewhere, to Mme. de Stermaria; its application to her who inspired it in me so soon afterwards was not therefore \u2014 as I so longed so needed to believe \u2014 absolutely necessary and predestined\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise had left me by myself in the dining-room with the remark that it was foolish of me to stay there before she had lighted the fire. She went to get me some dinner, for even before the return of my parents, from this very evening, my seclusion was to begin. I caught sight of a huge bundle of carpets, still rolled up, and leaning against one end of the sideboard, and burying my head in it, swallowing its dust with my own tears, as the Jews used to cover their heads with ashes in times of mourning, I began to sob. I shuddered not only because the room was cold, but because a distinct lowering of temperature (against the danger and \u2014 I should add, perhaps \u2014 the by no means disagreeable sensation of which we make no attempt to react) is brought about by a certain kind of tears which fall from our eyes, drop by drop, like a fine, penetrating, icy rain, and seem as though never would they cease to flow. Suddenly I heard a voice:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMay I come in? Fran\u00e7oise told me you would be in the dining-room. I looked in to see whether you would care to come out and dine somewhere, if it isn\u2019t bad for your throat \u2014 there\u2019s a fog outside you could cut with a knife.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was \u2014 arrived in Paris that morning, when I imagined him to be still in Morocco or on the sea \u2014 Robert de Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have already said (as a matter of fact, it was Robert himself who, at Balbec, had helped me, quite without meaning it, to arrive at this conclusion) what I think about friendship: to wit that it is so small a thing that I find it hard to understand how men with some claim to genius \u2014 Nietzsche, for instance \u2014 can have been such simpletons as to ascribe to it a certain intellectual value, and consequently to deny themselves friendships in which intellectual esteem would have no part. Yes, it has always been a surprise to me to find a man who carried sincerity towards himself to so high a pitch as to cut himself off, by a scruple of conscience, from Wagner\u2019s music, imagining that the truth could ever be attained by the mode of expression, naturally vague and inadequate, which our actions in general and acts of friendship in particular furnish, or that there could be any kind of significance in the fact of one\u2019s leaving one\u2019s work to go and see a friend and shed tears with him on hearing the false report that the Louvre was burned. I had got so far, at Balbec, as to find that the pleasure of playing with a troop of girls is less destructive of the spiritual life, to which at least it remains alien, than friendship, the whole effort of which is directed towards making us sacrifice the one real and (save by the channel of art) incommunicable part of ourself to a superficial self which finds \u2014 not, like the other, any joy in itself, but rather a vague, sentimental attraction in the feeling that it is being supported by external props, hospitably entertained by a strange personality, through which, happy in the protection that is afforded it there, it makes its own comfort radiate in warm approval, and marvels at qualities which it would denounce as faults and seek to correct in itself. Moreover the scorners of friendship can, without illusion and not without remorse, be the finest friends in the world, just as an artist carrying in his brain a masterpiece and feeling that his duty is rather to live and carry on his work, nevertheless, so as not to be thought or to run the risk of actually being selfish, gives his life for a vain cause, and gives it all the more gallantly in that the reasons for which he would have preferred not to give it were disinterested. But whatever might be my opinion of friendship, to mention only the pleasure that it procured me, of a quality so mediocre as to be like something halfway between physical exhaustion and mental boredom, there is no brew so deadly that it cannot at certain moments, become precious and invigorating by giving us just the stimulus that was necessary, the warmth that we cannot generate in ourselves\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The thought of course never entered my mind now of asking Saint-Loup to take me (as, an hour earlier, I had been longing to go) to see some of the Rivebelle women; the scar left by my disappointment with Mme. de Stermaria was too recent still to be so easily healed, but at the moment when I had ceased to feel in my heart any reason for happiness Saint-Loup\u2019s bursting in upon me was like a sudden apparition of kindness, mirth, life, which were external to me, no doubt, but offered themselves to me, asked only to be made mine. He did not himself understand my shout of gratitude, my tears of affection. And yet is there anything more unaccountably affecting than one of those friends, be he diplomat, explorer, airman or soldier like Saint-Loup, who, having to start next day for the country, from where they will go on heaven knows where, seem to form for themselves, in the evening which they devote to us, an impression which we are astonished both to find, so rare and fleeting is it, can be so pleasant to them, and, since it does so delight them, not to see them prolong farther or repeat more often. A meal with us, an event so natural in itself, affords these travellers the same strange and exquisite pleasure as our boulevards give to an Asiatic. We set off together to dine, and as I went downstairs I thought of Donci\u00e8res where every evening I used to meet Robert at his restaurant, and the little dining-rooms there that I had forgotten. I remembered one of these to which I had never given a thought, and which was not in the hotel where Saint-Loup dined but in another, far humbler, a cross between an inn and a boarding-house, where the waiting was done by the landlady and one of her servants. I had been forced to take shelter there once from a snowstorm. Besides, Robert was not to be dining at the hotel that evening and I had not cared to go any farther. My food was brought to me, upstairs, in a little room with bare wooden walls. The lamp went out during dinner and the servant lighted a couple of candles. I, pretending that I could not see very well as I held out my plate, while she helped me to potatoes, took her bare fore-arm in my hand, as though to guide her. Seeing that she did not withdraw it, I began to fondle it, then, without saying a word, pulled her bodily to me, blew out the candles and told her to feel in my pocket for some money. For the next few days physical pleasure seemed to me to require, to be properly enjoyed, not only this servant but the timbered dining-room, so remote and lonely. And yet it was to the other, in which Saint-Loup and his friends dined, that I returned every evening, from force of habit and in friendship for them, until I left Donci\u00e8res. But even of this hotel, where he took his meals with his friends, I had long ceased to think; we make little use of our experience, we leave unconsumed in the summer dusk or precocious nights of winter the hours in which it had seemed to us that there might nevertheless be contained some element of tranquillity or pleasure. But those hours are not altogether wasted. When, in their turn, come and sing to us fresh moments of pleasure, which by themselves would pass by equally bare in outline, the others recur, bringing with them the groundwork, the solid consistency of a rich orchestration. They are in this way prolonged into one of those types of happiness which we recapture only now and again but which continue to exist; in the present instance the type was that of forsaking everything else to dine in comfortable surroundings, which by the help of memory embody in a scene from nature suggestions of the rewards of travel, with a friend who is going to stir our dormant life with all his energy, his affection, to communicate to us an emotional pleasure, very different from anything that we could derive from our own efforts or from social distractions; we are going to exist solely for him, to utter vows of friendship which, born within the confines of the hour, remaining imprisoned in it, will perhaps not be kept on the morrow but which I need have no scruple in taking before Saint-Loup since, with a courage into which there entered a great deal of common sense and the presentiment that friendship cannot explore its own depths, on the morrow he would be gone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If as I came downstairs I lived over again the evenings at Donci\u00e8res, when we reached the street, in a moment the darkness, now almost total, in which the fog seemed to have put out the lamps, which one could make out, glimmering very faintly, only when close at hand, took me back to I could not say what arrival, by night, at Combray, when the streets there were still lighted only at long intervals and one felt one\u2019s way through a darkness moist, warm, consecrated, like that of a Christmas manger, just visibly starred here and there by a wick that burned no brighter than a candle. Between that year \u2014 to which I could ascribe no precise date \u2014 of my Combray life and the evenings at Rivebelle which had, an hour earlier, been reflected above my drawn curtains, what a world of differences! I felt on perceiving them an enthusiasm which might have borne fruit had I been left alone and would then have saved me the unnecessary round of many wasted years through which I was yet to pass before there was revealed to me that invisible vocation of which these volumes are the history. Had the revelation come to me this evening, the carriage in which I sat would have deserved to rank as more memorable with me than Dr. Percepied\u2019s, on the box seat of which I had composed that little sketch \u2014 on which, as it happened, I had recently laid my hands, altered it and sent it in vain to theFigaro \u2014 of the spires of Martinville. Is it because we live over our past years not in their continuous sequence, day by day, but in a memory that fastens upon the coolness or sun-parched heat of some morning or afternoon, receives the shadow of some solitary place, is enclosed, immovable, arrested, lost, remote from all others, because, therefore, the changes gradually wrought not only in the world outside but in our dreams and our evolving character (changes which have imperceptibly carried us through life from one to another, wholly different time), are of necessity eliminated, that, if we revive another memory taken from a different year, we find between the two, thanks to lacunae, to vast stretches of oblivion, as it were the gulf of a difference in altitude or the incompatibility of two divers qualities, that of the air we breathe and the colour of the scene before our eyes? But between one and another of the memories that had now come to me in turn of Combray, of Donci\u00e8res and of Rivebelle, I was conscious at the moment of more than a distance in time, of the distance that there would be between two separate universes the material elements in which were not the same. If I had sought to reproduce the element in which appeared carven my most trivial memories of Rivebelle, I should have had to streak with rosy veins, to render at once translucent, compact, refreshing, resonant a substance hitherto analogous to the coarse dark sandstone walls of Combray. But Robert having finished giving his instructions to the driver joined me now in the carriage. The ideas that had appeared before me took flight. Ideas are goddesses who deign at times to make themselves visible to a solitary mortal, at a turning in the road, even in his bedroom while he sleeps, when they, standing framed in the doorway, bring him the annunciation of their tidings. But as soon as a companion joins him they vanish, in the society of his fellows no man has ever beheld them. And I found myself cast back upon friendship. When he first appeared Robert had indeed warned me that there was a good deal of fog outside, but while we were indoors, talking, it had grown steadily thicker. It was no longer merely the light mist which I had looked forward to seeing rise from the island and envelop Mme. de Stermaria and myself. A few feet away from us the street lamps were blotted out and then it was night, as dark as in the open fields, in a forest, or rather on a mild Breton island whither I would fain have gone; I lost myself, as on the stark coast of some. Northern sea where one risks one\u2019s life twenty times over before coming to the solitary inn; ceasing to be a mirage for which one seeks, the fog became one of those dangers against which one has to fight, so that we had, in finding our way and reaching a safe haven, the difficulties, the anxiety and finally the joy which safety, so little perceived by him who is not threatened with the loss of it, gives to the perplexed and benighted traveller. One thing only came near to destroying my pleasure during our adventurous ride, owing to the angry astonishment into which it flung me for a moment, \u201cYou know, I told Bloch,\u201d Saint-Loup suddenly informed me, \u201cthat you didn\u2019t really think all that of him, that you found him rather vulgar at times. I\u2019m like that, you see, I want people to know where they stand,\u201d he wound up with a satisfied air and in a tone which brooked no reply. I was astounded. Not only had I the most absolute confidence in Saint-Loup, in the loyalty of his friendship, and he had betrayed it by what he had said to Bloch, but it seemed to me that he of all men ought to have been restrained from doing so, by his defects as well as by his good qualities, by that astonishing veneer of breeding which was capable of carrying politeness to what was positively a want of frankness. His triumphant air, was it what we assume to cloak a certain embarrassment in admitting a thing which we know that we ought not to have done, or did it mean complete unconsciousness; stupidity making a virtue out of a defect which I had not associated with him; a passing fit of ill humour towards me prompting him to make an end of our friendship, or the notation in words of a passing fit of ill humour in the company of Bloch to whom he had felt that he must say something disagreeable, even although I should be compromised by it? However that might be, his face was seared, while he uttered this vulgar speech, by a frightful sinuosity which I saw on it once or twice only in all the time I knew him, and which, beginning by running more or less down the middle of his face, when it came to his lips twisted them, gave them a hideous expression of baseness, almost of bestiality, quite transitory and no doubt inherited. There must have been at such moments, which recurred probably not more than once every other year, a partial eclipse of his true self by the passage across it of the personality of some ancestor whose shadow fell on him. Fully as much as his satisfied air, the words: \u201cI want people to know where they stand,\u201d encouraged the same doubt and should have incurred a similar condemnation. I felt inclined to say to him that if one wants people to know where they stand one ought to confine these outbursts of frankness to one\u2019s own affairs and not to acquire a too easy merit at the expense of others. But by this time the carriage had stopped outside the restaurant, the huge front of which, glazed and streaming with light, alone succeeded in piercing the darkness. The fog itself, beside the comfortable brightness of the lighted interior, seemed to be waiting outside on the pavement to shew one the way in with the joy of servants whose faces reflect the hospitable instincts of their master; shot with the most delicate shades of light, it pointed the way like the pillar of fire which guided the Children of Israel. Many of whom, as it happened, were to be found inside. For this was the place to which Bloch and his friends had long been in the habit, maddened by a hunger as famishing as the Ritual Fast, which at least occurs only once a year, for coffee and the satisfaction of political curiosity, of repairing in the evenings. Every mental excitement creating a value that overrides others, a quality superior to the rest of one\u2019s habits, there is no taste at all keenly developed that does not thus gather round it a society which it unites and in which the esteem of his fellows is what each of its members seeks before anything else from life. Here, in their caf\u00e9, be it in a little provincial town, you will find impassioned music-lovers; the greater part of their time, all their spare cash is spent in chamber-concerts, in meetings for musical discussion, in caf\u00e9s where one finds oneself among musical people and rubs shoulders with the members of the orchestra. Others, keen upon flying, seek to stand well with the old waiter in the glazed bar perched on top of the aerodrome; sheltered from the wind as in the glass cage of a lighthouse, they can follow in the company of an airman who is not going up that day the evolutions of a pilot practising loops, while another, invisible a moment ago, comes suddenly swooping down to land with the great winged roar of an Arabian roc. The little group which met to try to perpetuate, to explore the fugitive emotions aroused by the Zola trial attached a similar importance to this particular caf\u00e9. But they were not viewed with favour by the young nobles who composed the rest of its patrons and had taken possession of a second room, separated from the other only by a flimsy parapet topped with a row of plants. These looked upon Dreyfus and his supporters as traitors, albeit twenty-five years later, ideas having had time to classify themselves and Dreyfusism to acquire, in the light of history, a certain distinction, the sons, dance-mad Bolshevists, of these same young nobles were to declare to the \u2018intellectuals\u2019 who questioned them that undoubtedly, had they been alive at the time, they would have stood up for Dreyfus, without having any clearer idea of what the great Case had been about than Comtesse Edmond de Pourtal\u00e8s or the Marquise de Galliffet, other luminaries already extinct at the date of their birth. For on the night of the fog the noblemen of the caf\u00e9, who were in^ due course to become the fathers of these young intellectuals, Dreyfusards in retrospect, were still bachelors. Naturally the idea of a rich marriage was present in the minds of all their families, but none of them had yet brought such a marriage off. While still potential, the only effect of this rich marriage, the simultaneous ambition of several of them (there were indeed several heiresses in view, but after all the number of big dowries was considerably below that of the aspirants to them), was to create among these young men a certain amount of rivalry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As ill luck would have it, Saint-Loup remaining outside for a minute to explain to the driver that he was to call for us again after dinner, I had to make my way in by myself. In the first place, once I had involved myself in the spinning door, to which I was not accustomed, I began to fear that I should never succeed in escaping from it. (Let me note here for the benefit of lovers of verbal accuracy that the contrivance in question, despite its peaceful appearance, is known as a \u2018revolver,\u2019 from the English \u2018revolving door.\u2019) This evening the proprietor, not venturing either to brave the elements outside or to desert his customers, remained standing near the entrance so as to have the pleasure of listening to the joyful complaints of the new arrivals, all aglow with the satisfaction of people who have had difficulty in reaching a place and have been afraid of losing their way. The smiling cordiality of his welcome was, however, dissipated by the sight of a stranger incapable of disengaging himself from the rotating sheets of glass. This flagrant sign of social ignorance made him knit his brows like an examiner who has a good mind not to utter the formula: Dignus est intrare. As a crowning error I went to look for a seat in the room set apart for the nobility, from which he at once expelled me, indicating to me, with a rudeness to which all the waiters at once conformed, a place in the other room. This was all the less to my liking because the seat was in the middle of a crowded row and I had opposite me the door reserved for the Hebrews which, as it did not revolve, opening and shutting at every moment kept me in a horrible draught. But the proprietor declined to move me, saying: \u201cNo, Sir, I cannot have the whole place upset for you.\u201d Presently, however, he forgot this belated and troublesome guest, captivated as he was by the arrival of each newcomer who, before calling for his beer, his wing of cold chicken or his hot grog (it was by now long past dinner-time), must first, as in the old romances, pay his scot by relating his adventure at the moment of his entry into this asylum of warmth and security where the contrast with the perils just escaped made that gaiety and sense of comradeship prevail which create a cheerful harmony round the campfire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One reported that his carriage, thinking it had got to the Pont de la Concorde, had circled three times round the Invalides, another that his, in trying to make its way down the Avenue des Champs-Elys\u00e9es, had driven into a clump of trees at the Rond Point, from which it had taken him three quarters of an hour to get clear. Then followed lamentations upon the fog, the cold, the deathly stillness of the streets, uttered and received with the same exceptionally jovial air, which was accounted for by the pleasant atmosphere of the room which, except where I sat, was warm, the dazzling light which set blinking eyes already accustomed to not seeing, and the buzz of talk which restored their activity to deafened ears\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was all the newcomers could do to keep silence. The singularity of the mishaps which each of them thought unique burned their tongues, and their eyes roved in search of some one to engage in conversation. The proprietor himself lost all sense of social distinction. \u201cM. le Prince de Foix lost his way three times coming from the Porte Saint-Martin,\u201d he was not afraid to say with a laugh, actually pointing out, as though introducing one to the other, the illustrious nobleman to an Israelite barrister, who, on any evening but this, would have been divided from him by a barrier far harder to surmount than the ledge of greenery. \u201cThree times \u2014 fancy that!\u201d said the barrister, touching his hat. This note of personal interest was not at all to the Prince\u2019s liking. He formed one of an aristocratic group for whom the practice of impertinence, even at the expense of their fellow-nobles when these were not of the very highest rank, seemed the sole possible occupation. Not to acknowledge a bow, and, if the polite stranger repeated the offence, to titter with sneering contempt or fling back one\u2019s head with a look of fury, to pretend not to know some elderly man who might have done them a service, to reserve their handclasp for dukes and the really intimate friends of dukes whom the latter introduced to them, such was the attitude of these young men, and especially of the Prince de Foix. Such an attitude was encouraged by the ill-balanced mentality of early manhood (a period in which, even in the middle class, one appears ungrateful and behaves like a cad because, having forgotten for months to write to a benefactor after he has lost his wife, one then ceases to nod to him in the street so as to simplify matters), but it was inspired above all by an over-acute caste snobbishness. It is true that, after the fashion of certain nervous affections the symptoms of which grow less pronounced in later life, this snobbishness was on the whole to cease to express itself in so offensive a form in these men who had been so intolerable when young. Once youth is outgrown, it is seldom that anyone remains hidebound by insolence. He had supposed it to be the only thing in the world; suddenly he discovers, for all the Prince that he is, that there also are such things as music, literature, even standing for parliament. The scale of human values is correspondingly altered and he joins in conversation with people whom at one time he would have slain with a glare of lightning. Which is fortunate for those of the latter who have had the patience to wait, and whose character is sufficiently formed \u2014 if one may so put it \u2014 for them to feel pleasure in receiving in their forties the civility and welcome that had been coldly withheld from them at twenty\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I have mentioned the Prince de Foix, it may not be inconsequent here to add that he belonged to a set of a dozen or fifteen young men and to an inner group of four. The dozen or fifteen shared this characteristic (which the Prince lacked, I fancy) that each of them faced the world in a dual aspect. Up to their own eyes in debt, they were of no account in those of their tradesmen, notwithstanding the pleasure these took in addressing them as \u2018Monsieur le Comte,\u2019 \u2018Monsieur le Marquis,\u2019 \u2018Monsieur le Duc.\u2019 They hoped to retrieve their fortunes by means of the famous rich marriage (\u2018money-bags\u2019 as the expression still was) and, as the fat dowries which they coveted numbered at the most four or five, several of them would be silently training their batteries on the same damsel. And the secret would be so well kept that when one of them, on arriving at the caf\u00e9, announced: \u201cMy dear fellows, I am too fond of you all not to tell you of my engagement to Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac,\u201d there was a general outburst, more than one of the others imagining that the marriage was as good as settled already between Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac and himself, and not having enough self-control to stifle a spontaneous cry of stupefaction and rage. \u201cSo you like the idea of marriage, do you Bibi?\u201d the Prince de Ch\u00e2tellerault could not help exclaiming, letting his fork drop in his surprise and despair, for he had been fully expecting the engagement of this identical Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac to be announced, but with himself, Ch\u00e2tellerault, as her bridegroom. And heaven only knew all that his father had cunningly hinted to the Ambresacs against Bibi\u2019s mother. \u201cSo you think it\u2019ll be fun, being married, do you?\u201d he was impelled to repeat his question to Bibi, who, better prepared to meet it, for he had had plenty of time to decide on the right attitude to adopt since the engagement had reached the semi-official stage, replied with a smile: \u201cWhat pleases me is not the idea of marriage, which never appealed much to me, but marrying Daisy d\u2019Ambresac, whom I think charming.\u201d In the time taken up by this response M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault had recovered his composure, but he was thinking that he must at the earliest possible moment execute a change of front in the direction of Mlle. de la Canourque or Miss Foster, numbers two and three on the list of heiresses, pacify somehow the creditors who were expecting the Ambresac marriage and finally explain to the people to whom he too had declared that Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac was charming that this marriage was all very well for Bibi, but that he himself would have had all his family down on him like a ton of bricks if he had married her. Mme. Sol\u00e9on (he decided to say) had actually announced that she would not have them in her house\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if in the eyes of tradesmen, proprietors of restaurants and the like they seemed of little account, conversely, being creatures of dual personality, the moment they appeared in society they ceased to be judged by the decay of their fortunes and the sordid occupations by which they sought to repair them. They became once more M. le Prince this, M. le Duc that and were reckoned only in terms of their quarterings. A duke who was prac^ tically a multi-millionaire and seemed to combine in his own person every possible distinction gave precedence to them because, the heads of their various houses, they were by descent sovereign princes of minute territories in which they were entitled to coin money and so forth. Often in this caf\u00e9 one of them lowered his eyes when another came in so as not to oblige the newcomer to greet him. This was because in his imaginative pursuit of riches he had invited a banker to dine. Every time that a man about town enters into relations, on this footing, with a banker, the latter leaves him the poorer by a hundred thousand francs, which does not prevent the man about town from at once repeating the process with another. We continue to burn candles in churches and to consult doctors\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the Prince de Foix, who was rich already, belonged not only to this fashionable set of fifteen or so young men, but to a more exclusive and inseparable group of four which included Saint-Loup. These were never asked anywhere separately, they were known as the four gigolos, they were always to be seen riding together, in country houses their hostesses gave them communicating bedrooms, with the result that, especially as they were all four extremely good looking, rumours were current as to the extent of their intimacy. I was in a position to give these the lie direct so far as Saint-Loup was concerned. But the curious thing is that if, later on, one was to learn that these rumours were true of all four, each of the quartet had been entirely in the dark as to the other three. And yet each of them had done his utmost to find out about the others, to gratify a desire or (more probably) a resentment, to prevent a marriage or to secure a hold over the friend whose secret he discovered. A fifth (for in these groups of four there are never four only) had joined this Platonic party who was more so than any of the others. But religious scruples restrained him until long after the group had broken up, and he himself was a married man, the father of a family, fervently praying at Lourdes that the next baby might be a boy or a girl, and spending the intervals of procreation in the pursuit of soldiers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the Prince\u2019s code of manners, the fact that the barrister\u2019s comment, though uttered in his hearing, had not been directly addressed to him made him less angry than he would otherwise have been. Besides, this evening was somewhat exceptional. Finally, the barrister had no more prospect of coming to know the Prince de Foix than the cabman who had driven that noble lord to the restaurant. The Prince felt, accordingly, that he might allow himself to reply, in an arrogant tone, as though speaking to some one \u2018off stage,\u2019 to this stranger who, thanks to the fog, was in the position of a travelling companion whom one meets at some seaside place at the ends of the earth, scoured by all the winds of heaven or shrouded in mist: \u201cLosing your way\u2019s nothing; the trouble is, you can\u2019t find it again.\u201d The wisdom of this aphorism impressed the proprietor, for he had already heard it several times in the course of the evening\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was, in fact, in the habit of always comparing what he heard or read with an already familiar canon, and felt his admiration aroused if he could detect no difference. This state of mind is by no means to be ignored, for, applied to political conversations, to the reading of newspapers, it forms public opinion and thereby makes possible the greatest events in history. An aggregation of German landlords, simply by being impressed by a customer or a newspaper when he or it said that France, England and Russia were \u2018out to crush\u2019 Germany, made war, at the time of Agadir, possible, even if no war occurred. Historians, if they have not been wrong to abandon the practice of attributing the actions of peoples to the will of kings, ought to substitute for the latter the psychology of the person of no importance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In politics the proprietor of this particular caf\u00e9 had for some time now concentrated his pupil-teacher\u2019s mind on certain particular details of the Dreyfus case. If he did not find the terms that were familiar to him in the conversation of a customer or the columns of a newspaper he would pronounce the article boring or the speaker insincere. The Prince de Foix, however, impressed him so forcibly that he barely gave him time to finish what he was saying. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Prince, that\u2019s right,\u201d (which meant neither more nor less than \u2018repeated without a mistake\u2019) \u201cthat\u2019s exactly how it is!\u201d he exclaimed, expanding, like people in the Arabian Nights \u2018to the limit of repletion.\u2019 But the Prince had by this time vanished into the smaller room. Then, as life resumes its normal course after even the most sensational happenings, those who had emerged from the sea of fog began to order whatever they wanted to eat or drink; among them a party of young men from the Jockey Club who, in view of the abnormality of the situation, had no hesitation in taking their places at a couple of tables in the big room, and were thus quite close to me. So the cataclysm had established even between the smaller room and the bigger, among all these people stimulated by the comfort of the restaurant after their long wanderings across the ocean of fog, a familiarity from which I alone was excluded, not unlike the spirit that must have prevailed in Noah\u2019s ark. Suddenly I saw the landlord\u2019s body whipped into a series of bows, the head waiters hurrying to support him in a full muster which drew every eye towards the door. \u201cQuick, send Cyprien here, lay a table for M. le Marquis de Saint-Loup,\u201d cried the proprietor, for whom Robert was not merely a great nobleman possessing a real importance even in the eyes of the Prince de Foix, but a client who drove through life four-in-hand, so to speak, and spent a great deal of money in this restaurant. The customers in the big room looked on with interest, those in the small room shouted simultaneous greetings to their friend as he finished wiping his shoes. But just as he was about to make his way into the small room he caught sight of me in the big one. \u201cGood God,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cwhat on earth are you doing there? And with the door wide open too?\u201d he went on, with an angry glance at the proprietor, who ran to shut it, throwing the blame on his staff: \u201cI\u2019m always telling them to keep it shut.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had been obliged to shift my own table and to disturb others which stood in the way in order to reach him. \u201cWhy did you move? Would you sooner dine here than in the little room? Why, my poor fellow, you\u2019re freezing. You will oblige me by keeping that door locked;\u201d he turned to the proprietor. \u201cThis very instant, M. le Marquis; the gentlemen will have to go out of this room through the other, that is all.\u201d And the better to shew his zeal he detailed for this operation a head waiter and several satel lites, vociferating the most terrible threats of punishment were it not properly carried out. He began to shew me exaggerated marks of respect so as to make me forget that these had begun not upon my arrival but only after that of Saint-Loup, while, lest I should think them to have been prompted by the friendliness shewn me by his rich and noble client he gave me now and again a surreptitious little smile which seemed to indicate a regard that was wholly personal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Something said by one of the diners behind me made me turn my head for a moment. I had caught, instead of the words: \u201cWing of chicken, excellent; and a glass of champagne, only not too dry,\u201d the unexpected: \u201cI should prefer glycerine. Yes, hot, excellent.\u201d I wanted to see who the ascetic was that was inflicting upon himself such a diet. I turned quickly back to Saint-Loup so as not to be recognised by the man of strange appetite. It was simply a doctor, whom I happened to know, and of whom another customer, taking advantage of the fog to buttonhole him here in the caf\u00e9, was asking his professional advice. Like stockbrokers, doctors employ the first person singular\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile I was studying Saint-Loup, and my thoughts took a line of their own. They were in this caf\u00e9, I had myself known at other times, plenty of foreigners, intellectuals, budding geniuses of all sorts, resigned to the laughter excited by their pretentious capes, their 1830 neckties and still more by the clumsiness of their movements, going so far as to provoke that laughter in order to shew that they paid no heed to it, who yet were men of real intellectual and moral worth, of an extreme sensibility. They repelled \u2014 the Jews among them principally, the unassimilated Jews, that is to say, for with the other kind we are not concerned \u2014 those who could not endure any oddity or eccentricity of appearance (as Bloch repelled Al-bertine). Generally speaking, one realised afterwards that if they had against them hair worn too long, noses and eyes that were too big, stilted theatrical gestures, it was puerile to judge them by these only, they had plenty of intelligence and spirit and were men to whom, in the long run, one could become closely attached. Among the Jews especially there were few whose parents and kinsfolk had not a warmth of heart, a breadth of mind in comparison with which Saint-Loup\u2019s mother and the Duc de Guermantes cut the poorest of figures by their sereness, their skin-deep religiosity which denounced only the most open scandals, their apology for a Christianity which led invariably (by the unexpected channel of a purely calculating mind) to an enormously wealthy marriage. But in Saint-Loup, when all was said, however the faults of his relatives might be combined in a fresh creation of character, there reigned the most charming openness of mind and heart. And whenever (it must be frankly admitted, to the undying glory of France) these qualities are found in a man who is purely French, be he noble or plebeian, they flower \u2014 flourish would be too strong a word, for a sense of proportion persists and also a certain restraint \u2014 with a grace which the foreign visitor, however estimable he may be, does not present to us. Of these intellectual and moral qualities others undoubtedly have their share, and if we have first to overcome what repels us and what makes us smile they remain no less precious. But it is all the same a pleasant thing, and one which is perhaps exclusively French that what is fine from the standpoint of equity, what is of value to the heart and mind should be first of all attractive to the eyes, charmingly coloured, consummately chiselled, should express outwardly as well in substance as in form an inward perfection. I studied Saint-Loup\u2019s features and said to myself that it is a thing to be glad of when there is no lack of bodily grace to prepare one for the graces within, and when the winged nostrils are spread as delicately and with as perfect a design as the wings of the little butterflies that hover over the field-flowers round Combray; and that the true opus francigenum, the secret of which was not lost in the thirteenth century, the beauty of which would not be lost with the destruction of our churches, consists not so much in the stone angels of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs as in the young sons of France, noble, citizen or peasant, whose faces are carved with that delicacy and boldness which have remained as traditional there as on the famous porch, but are creative still as well\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After leaving us for a moment in order to supervise personally the barring of the door and the ordering of our dinner (he laid great stress on our choosing \u2018butcher\u2019s meat,\u2019 the fowls being presumably nothing to boast of) the proprietor came back to inform us that M. le Prince de Foix would esteem it a favour if M. le Marquis would allow him to dine at a table next to ours. \u201cBut they are all taken,\u201d objected Robert, casting an eye over the tables which blocked the way to mine. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter in the least, if M. le Marquis would like it, I can easily ask these people to move to another table. It is always a pleasure to do anything for M. le Marquis!\u201d \u201cBut you must decide,\u201d said Saint-Loup to me. \u201cFoix is a good fellow, he may bore you or he may not; anyhow he\u2019s not such a fool as most of them.\u201d I told Robert that of course I should like to meet his friend but that now that I was for once in a way dining with him and was so entirely happy, I should be just as well pleased to have him all to myself. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very fine cloak, the Prince has,\u201d the proprietor broke in upon our deliberation. \u201cYes, I know,\u201d said Saint-Loup. I wanted to tell Robert that M. de Charlus had disclaimed all knowledge of me to his sister-in-law, and to ask him what could be the reason of this, but was prevented by the arrival of M. de Foix. Come to see whether his request had been favourably received, we caught sight of him standing beside our table. Robert introduced us, but did not hide from his friend that as we had things to talk about he would prefer not to be disturbed. The Prince withdrew, adding to the farewell bow which he made me a smile which, pointed at Saint-Loup, seemed to transfer to him the responsibility for the shortness of a meeting which the Prince himself would have liked to see prolonged. As he turned to go, Robert, struck, it appeared, by a sudden idea, dashed off after his friend, with a \u201cStay where you are and get on with your dinner, I shall be back in a moment,\u201d to me; and vanished into the smaller room. I was pained to hear the smart young men sitting near me, whom I did not know, repeat the most absurd and malicious stories about the young Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg (formerly Comte de Nassau) whom I had met at Balbec and who had shewn me such delicate marks of sympathy at the time of my grandmother\u2019s illness. According to one of these young me he had said to the Duchesse de Guermantes: \u201cI expect everyone to get up when my wife passes,\u201d to which the Duchess had retorted (with as little truth, had she said any such thing, as humour, the grandmother of the young Princess having always been the very pink of propriety): \u201cGet up when your wife passes, do they? Well, that\u2019s a change from her grandmother\u2019s day. She expected the gentlemen to lie down.\u201d Then some one alleged that, having gone down to see his aunt the Princesse de Luxembourg at Balbec, and put up at the Grand Hotel, he had complained to the manager there (my friend) that the royal standard of Luxembourg was not flown in front of the hotel, over the sea. And that this flag being less familiar and less generally in use than the British or Italian, it had taken him several days to procure one, greatly to the young Grand Duke\u2019s annoyance. I did not believe a word of this story, but made up my mind, as soon as I went to Balbec, to inquire of the manager, so as to make certain that it was a pure invention. While waiting for Saint-Loup to return I asked the proprietor to get me some bread. \u201cCertainly, Monsieur le Baron!\u201d \u201cI am not a Baron,\u201d I told him. \u201cOh, beg pardon, Monsieur le Comte!\u201d I had no time to lodge a second protest which would certainly have promoted me to the rank of marquis; faithful to his promise of an immediate return, Saint-Loup reappeared in the doorway carrying over his arm the thick vicuna cloak of the Prince de Foix, from whom I guessed that he had borrowed it in order to keep me warm. He signed to me not to get up, and came towards me, but either my table would have to be moved again or I must change my seat if he was to get to his. Entering the big room he sprang lightly on to one of the red plush benches which ran round its walls and on which, apart from myself, there were sitting only three or four of the young men from the Jockey Club, friends of his own, who had not managed to find places in the other room. Between the tables and the wall electric wires were stretched at a certain height; without the least hesitation Saint-Loup jumped nimbly over them like a horse in a steeplechase; embarrassed that it should be done wholly for my benefit and to save me the trouble of a slight movement, I was at the same time amazed at the precision with which my friend performed this exercise in l\u00e9vitation; and in this I was not alone; for, albeit they would probably have had but little admiration for a similar display on the part of a more humbly born and less generous client, the proprietor and his staff stood fascinated, like racegoers in the enclosure; one underling, apparently rooted to the ground, stood there gaping with a dish in his hand for which a party close beside him were waiting; and when Saint-Loup, having to get past his friends, climbed on the narrow ledge behind them and ran along it, balancing himself with his arms, discreet applause broke from the body of the room. On coming to where I was sitting he stopped short in his advance with the precision of a tributary chieftain before the throne of a sovereign, and, stooping down, handed to me with an air of courtesy and submission the vicuna cloak which, a moment later, having taken his place beside me, without my having to make a single movement he arranged as a light but warm shawl about my shoulders\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBy the way, while I think of it, my uncle Charlus has something to say to you. I promised I\u2019d send you round to him to-morrow evening.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just going to speak to you about him. But to-morrow evening I am dining with your aunt Guermantes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes there\u2019s a regular beanfeast to-morrow at Oriane\u2019s. I\u2019m not asked. But my uncle Palam\u00e8de doesn\u2019t want you to go there. You can\u2019t get out of it, I suppose? Well, anyhow, go on to my uncle\u2019s afterwards. I\u2019m sure he really does want to see you. Look here, you can easily manage to get there by eleven. Eleven o\u2019clock; don\u2019t forget; I\u2019ll let him know. He\u2019s very touchy. If you don\u2019t turn up he\u2019ll never forgive you. And Oriane\u2019s parties are always over quite early. If you are only going to dine there you can quite easily be at my uncle\u2019s by eleven. I ought really to go and see Oriane, about getting shifted from Morocco; I want an exchange. She is so nice about all that sort of thing, and she can get anything she likes out of General de Saint-Joseph, who runs that branch. But don\u2019t say anything about it to her. I\u2019ve mentioned it to the Princesse de Parme, everything will be all right. Interesting place, Morocco. I could tell you all sorts of things. Very fine lot of men out there. One feels they\u2019re on one\u2019s own level, mentally.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t think the Germans are going to go to war about it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; they\u2019re annoyed with us, as after all they have every right to be. But the Emperor is out for peace. They are always making us think they want war, to force us to give in. Pure bluff, you know, like poker. The Prince of Monaco, one of Wilhelm\u2019s agents, comes and tells us in confidence that Germany will attack us. Then we give way. But if we didn\u2019t give way, there wouldn\u2019t be war in any shape or form. You have only to think what a comic spectacle a war would be in these days. It\u2019d be a bigger catastrophe than the Flood and the G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung rolled in one. Only it wouldn\u2019t last so long.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He spoke to me of friendship, affection, regret, albeit like all visitors of his sort he was going off the next morning for some months, which he was to spend in the country, and would only be staying a couple of nights in Paris on his way back to Morocco (or elsewhere); but the words which he thus let fall into the heated furnace which my heart was this evening kindled a pleasant glow there. Our infrequent meetings, this one in particular, have since formed a distinct episode in my memories. For him, as for me, this was the evening of friendship. And yet the friendship that I felt for him at this moment was scarcely, I feared (and felt therefore some remorse at the thought), what he would have liked to inspire. Filled still with the pleasure that I had had in seeing him come bounding towards me and gracefully pause on arriving at his goal, I felt that this pleasure lay in my recognising that each of the series of movements which he had developed against the wall, along the bench, had its meaning, its cause in Saint-Loup\u2019s own personal nature, possibly, but even more in that which by birth and upbringing he had inherited from his race\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A certainty of taste in the region not of beauty but manners, which when he was faced by a novel combination of circumstances enabled the man of breeding to grasp at once \u2014 like a musician who has been asked to play a piece he has never seen \u2014 the feeling, the motions that were required, and to apply the appropriate mechanism and technique; which then allowed this taste to display itself without the constraint of any other consideration, by which the average young man of the middle class would have been paralysed, from fear as well of making himself ridiculous in the eyes of strangers by his disregard of convention as of appearing too deferential in the eyes of his friends; the place of this constraint being taken in Robert by a lofty disdain which certainly he had never felt in his heart but which he had received by inheritance in his body, and which had moulded the attitudes of his ancestors to a familiarity with their inferiors which, they imagined, could only flatter and enchant those to whom it was displayed; lastly, a noble liberality which, taking no account of his boundless natural advantages (lavish expenditure in this restaurant had succeeded in making him, here as elsewhere, the most fashionable customer and the general favourite, a position which was underlined by the deference shewn him throughout the place not only by the waiters but by all its most exclusive young patrons), led him to trample them underfoot, just as he had, actually and symbolically, trodden upon those benches decked with purple, like a triumphal way which pleased my friend only because it enabled him more gracefully and swiftly to arrive at my side; such were the qualities, essential to aristocracy, which through the husk of this body, not opaque and vague as mine would have been, but significant and limpid, transmitted as through a work of art the industrious, energetic force which had created it and rendered the movements of this lightfoot course which Robert had pursued along the wall intelligible and charming as those of a row of knights upon a marble frieze. \u201cAlas!\u201d Robert might have thought, \u201cwas it worth while to have grown up despising birth, honouring only justice and intellect, choosing outside the ranks of the friends provided for me companions who were awkward and ill-dressed, provided they had the gift of eloquence, only for the sole personality apparent in me, which is to remain a treasured memory, to be not that which my will, with the most praiseworthy effort, has fashioned in my likeness, but one which is not of my making, which is not even myself, which I have always disliked and striven to overcome; was it worth while to love my chosen friend as I have loved him, for the greatest pleasure that he can find in me to be that of discovering something far more general than myself, a pleasure which is not in the least (as he says, though he cannot seriously believe it) one of the pleasures of friendship, but an intellectual and detached, a sort of artistic pleasure?\u201d This is what I am now afraid that Saint-Loup may at times have thought. If so, he was mistaken. If he had not (as he steadfastly had) cherished something more lofty than the suppleness innate in his body, if he had not kept aloof for so long from the pride that goes with noble birth, there would have been something more studied, a certain heaviness in his very agility, a self-important vulgarity in his manners. As with Mme. de Villeparisis a strong vein of seriousness had been necessary for her to give in her conversation and in her Memoirs a sense of the frivolous, which is intellectual, so, in order that Saint-Loup\u2019s body might be indwelt by so much nobility, the latter had first to desert a mind that was aiming at higher things, and, reabsorbed into his body, to be fixed there in unconscious, noble lines. In this way his distinction of mind was not absent from a bodily distinction which otherwise would not have been complete. An artist has no need to express his mind directly in his work for it to express the quality of that mind; it has indeed been said that the highest praise of God consists in the denial of Him by the atheist, who finds creation so perfect that it can dispense with a creator. And I was quite well aware that it was not merely a work of art that I was admiring in this young man unfolding along the wall the frieze of his flying course; the young Prince (a descendant of Catherine de Foix, Queen of Navarre and grand-daughter of Charles VII) whom he had just left for my sake, the endowments, by birth and fortune, which he was laying at my feet, the proud and shapely ancestors who survived in the assurance, the agility, the courtesy with which he now arranged about my shivering body the warm woollen cloak, were not all these like friends of longer standing in his life, by whom I might have expected that we should be permanently kept apart, and whom, on the contrary, he was sacrificing to me by a choice which one can make only in the loftiest places of the mind, with that sovereign liberty of which Robert\u2019s movements were the presentment and in which is realised perfect friendship?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How much familiar intercourse with a Guermantes \u2014 in place of the distinction that it had in Robert, because there the inherited scorn of humanity was but the outer garment, become an unconscious charm, of a real moral humility \u2014 could disclose of vulgar arrogance I had had an opportunity of seeing, not in M. de Charlus, in whom certain characteristic faults, for which I had been unable, so far, to account, were overlaid upon his aristocratic habits, but in the Duc de Guermantes. And yet he too, in the general impression of commonness which had so strongly repelled my grandmother when she had met him once, years earlier, at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, included glimpses of historic grandeur of which I became conscious when I went to dine in his house, on the evening following that which I had spent with Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They had not been apparent to me either in himself or in the Duchess when I had met them first in their aunt\u2019s drawing-room, any more than I had discerned, on first seeing her, the differences that set Berma apart from her fellow-players, all the more that in her the individuality was infinitely more striking than in any social celebrity, such distinctions becoming more marked in proportion as the objects are more real, more conceivable by the intellect. And yet, however slight the shades of social distinction may be (and so slight are they that when an accurate portrayer like Sainte-Beuve tries to indicate the shades of difference between the salons of Mme. Geoffrin, Mme. R\u00e9camier and Mme. de Boigne, they appear so much alike that the cardinal truth which, unknown to the author, emerges from his investigations is the vacuity of that form of life), with them, and for the same reason as with Berma, when the Guermantes had ceased to impress me and the tiny drop of their originality was no longer vaporised by my imagination, I was able to distil and analyse it, imponderable as it was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duchess having made no reference to her husband when she talked to me at her aunt\u2019s party, I wondered whether, in view of the rumours of a divorce that were current, he would be present at the dinner. But my doubts were speedily set at rest, for through the crowd of footmen who stood about in the hall and who (since they must until then have regarded me much as they regarded the children of the evicted cabinet-maker, that is to say with more fellow-feeling perhaps than their master but as a person incapable of being admitted to his house) must have been asking themselves to what this social revolution could be due, I saw slip towards me M. de Guermantes himself, who had been watching for my arrival so as to receive me upon his threshold and take off my greatcoat with his own hands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMme. de Guermantes will be as pleased as punch,\u201d he greeted me in a glibly persuasive tone. \u201cLet me help you off with your duds.\u201d (He felt it to be at once companionable and comic to employ the speech of the people.) \u201cMy wife was just the least bit afraid you might fail us, although you had fixed a date. We\u2019ve been saying to each other all day long: \u2018Depend upon it, he\u2019ll never turn up.\u2019 I am bound to say, Mme. de Guermantes was a better prophet than I was. You are not an easy man to get hold of, and I was quite sure you were going to play us false.\u201d And the Duke was so bad a husband, so brutal even (people said), that one felt grateful to him, as one feels grateful to wicked people for their occasional kindness of heart, for those words \u2018Mme. de Guermantes\u2019 with which he appeared to be spreading out over the Duchess a protecting wing, that she might be but one flesh with him. Meanwhile, taking me familiarly by the hand, he began to lead the way, to introduce me into his household. Just as some casual phrase may delight us coming from the lips of a peasant if it points to the survival of a local tradition, shews the trace of some historic event unknown, it may be, to him who thus alludes to it; so this politeness on the part of M. de Guermantes, which, moreover, he was to continue to shew me throughout the evening, charmed me as a survival of habits of many centuries\u2019 growth, habits of the seventeenth century in particular. The people of bygone ages seem to us infinitely remote. We do not feel justified in ascribing to them any underlying intention apart from those to which they give formal expression; we are amazed when we come upon a sentiment more or less akin to what we are feeling to-day in a Homeric hero, or upon a skilful tactical feint in Hannibal, during the buttle of Cannae, where he let his flank be driven back in order to take the enemy by surprise and surround him; it would seem that we imagined the epic poet and the Punic general as being as remote from ourselves as an animal seen in a zoological garden. Even in certain personages of the court of Louis XIV, when we find signs of courtesy in the letters written by them to some man of inferior rank who could be of no service to them whatever, they leave us bewildered because they reveal to us suddenly, as existing among these great gentlemen, a whole world of beliefs to which they never give any direct expression but which govern their conduct, and especially the belief that they are bound in politeness to feign certain sentiments and to carry out with the most scrupulous care certain obligations of friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This imagined remoteness of the past is perhaps one of the things that enable us to understand how even great writers have found an inspired beauty in the works of mediocre mystifiers, such as Macpherson\u2019s Ossian. We so little expected to learn that bards long dead could have modern ideas that we marvel if in what we believe to be an ancient Gaelic ode we come upon one which we should have thought, at the most, ingenious in a contemporary. A translator of talent has simply to add to an ancient writer whom he presents to us more or less faithfully reproduced fragments which, signed with a contemporary name and published separately, would seem entertaining only; at once he imparts a moving grandeur to his poet, who is thus made to play upon the keyboards of several ages at once. This translator was capable only of a mediocre book, if that book had been published as his original work. Given out as a translation, it seems that of a masterpiece. The past not merely is not fugitive, it remains present. It is not within a few months only after the outbreak of a war that laws passed without haste can effectively influence its course, it is not within fifteen years only after a crime which has remained obscure that a magistrate can still find the vital evidence which will throw a light on it; after hundreds and thousands of years the scholar who has been studying in a distant land the place-names, the customs of the inhabitants, may still extract from them some legend long anterior to the Christian era, already unintelligible, if not actually forgotten, at the time of Herodotus, which in the name given to a rock, in a religious rite, dwells surrounded by the present, like an emanation of greater density, immemorial and stable. There was similarly an emanation, though far less ancient, of the life of the court, if not in the manners of M. de Guermantes, which were often vulgar, at least in the mind that controlled them. I was to breathe this again, like the odour of antiquity, when I joined him a little later in the drawing-room. For I did not go there at once\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we left the outer hall, I had mentioned to M. de Guermantes that I was extremely anxious to see his Elstirs. \u201cI am at your service. Is M. Elstir a friend of yours, then? If so, it is most vexing, for I know him slightly; he is a pleasant fellow, what our fathers used to call an \u2018honest fellow\u2019; I might have asked him to honour us with his company, and to dine tonight. I am sure he would have been highly flattered at being invited to spend the evening in your society.\u201d Very little suggestive of the old order when he tried thus to assume its manner, the Duke relapsed unconsciously into it. After inquiring whether I wished him to shew me the pictures, he conducted me to them, gracefully standing aside for me at each door, apologising when, to shew me the way, he was obliged to precede me, a little scene which (since the days when Saint-Simon relates that an ancestor of the Guermantes did him the honours of his town house with the same punctilious exactitude in the performance of the frivolous duties of a gentleman) must, before coming gradually down to us, have been enacted by many other Guermantes for numberless other visitors. And as I had said to the Duke that I would like very much to be left alone for a few minutes with the pictures, he discreetly withdrew, telling me that I should find him in the drawing-room when I was ready\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only, once I was face to face with the Elstirs, I completely forgot about dinner and the time; here again as at Balbec I had before me fragments of that strangely coloured world which was no more than the projection, the way of seeing things peculiar to that great painter, which his speech in no way expressed. The parts of the walls that were covered by paintings from his brush, all homogeneous with one another, were like the luminous images of a magic lantern, which would have been in this instance the brain of the artist, and the strangeness of which one could never have suspected so long as one had known only the man, which was like seeing the iron lantern boxing its lamp before any coloured slide had been slid into its groove. Among these pictures several of the kind that seemed most absurd to ordinary people interested me more than the rest because they recreated those optical illusions which prove to us that we should never succeed in identifying objects if we did not make some process of reasoning intervene How often, when driving in the dark, do we not come upon a long, lighted street which begins a few feet away from us, when what we have actually before our eyes is nothing but a rectangular patch of wall with a bright light falling on it, which has given us the mirage of depth. In view of which is it not logical, not by any artifice of symbolism but by a sincere return to the very root of the impression, to represent one thing by that other for which, in the flash of a first illusion, we mistook it? Surfaces and volumes are in reality independent of the names of objects which our memory imposes on them after we have recognised them. Elstir attempted to wrest from what he had just felt what he already knew, his effort had often been to break up that aggregate of impressions which we call vision\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The people who detested these \u2018horrors\u2019 were astonished to find that Elstir admired Chardin, Perroneau, any number of painters whom they, the ordinary men and women of society, liked. They did not take into account that Elstir had had to make, for his own part, in striving to reproduce reality (with the particular index of his taste for certain lines of approach), the same effort as a Chardin or a Perroneau and that consequently, when he ceased to work for himself, he admired in them attempts of the same order, fragments anticipatory so to speak of works of his own. Nor did these society people include in their conception of Elstir\u2019s work that temporal perspective which enabled them to like, or at least to look without discomfort at Chardin\u2019s painting. And yet the older among them might have reminded themselves that in the course of their lives they had seen gradually, as the years bore them away from it, the unbridgeable gulf between what they considered a masterpiece by Ingres and what, they had supposed, must remain for ever a \u2018horror\u2019 (Manet\u2019sOlympia, for example) shrink until the two canvases seemed like twins. But we learn nothing from any lesson because we have not the wisdom to work backwards from the particular to the general, and imagine ourselves always to be going through an experience which is without precedents in the past\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was moved by the discovery in two of the pictures (more realistic, these, and in an earlier manner) of the same person, in one in evening dress in his own drawing-room, in the other wearing a frock coat and tall hat at some popular regatta where he had evidently no business to be, which proved that for Elstir he was not only a regular sitter but a friend, perhaps a patron whom it pleased him (just as Carpaccio used to introduce prominent figures, and in speaking likenesses, from contemporary life in Venice) to introduce into his pictures, just as Beethoven, too, found pleasure in inscribing at the top of a favourite work the beloved name of the Archduke Rudolph. There was something enchanting about this waterside carnival. The river, the women\u2019s dresses, the sails of the boats, the innumerable reflexions of one thing and another came crowding into this little square panel of beauty which Elstir had cut out of a marvellous afternoon. What delighted one in the dress of a woman who had stopped for a moment in the dance because it was hot and she was out of breath was irresistible also in the same way in the canvas of a motionless sail, in the water of the little harbour, in the wooden bridge, in the leaves of the trees and in the sky. As in one of the pictures that I had seen at Balbec, the hospital, as beautiful beneath its sky of lapis lazuli as the cathedral itself, seemed (more bold than Elstir the theorician, then Elstir the man of taste, the lover of things mediaeval) to be intoning: \u201cThere is no such thing as gothic, there is no such thing as a masterpiece; this tasteless hospital is just as good as the glorious porch,\u201d so I now heard: \u201cThe slightly vulgar lady at whom a man of discernment would refrain from glancing as he passed her by, would except from the poetical composition which nature has set before him \u2014 her dress is receiving the same light as the sail of that boat, and there are no degrees of value and beauty; the commonplace dress and the sail, beautiful in itself, are two mirrors reflecting the same gleam; the value is all in the painter\u2019s eye.\u201d This eye had had the skill to arrest for all time the motion of the hours at this luminous instant, when the lady had felt hot and had stopped dancing, when the tree was fringed with a belt of shadow, when the sails seemed to be slipping over a golden glaze. But just because the depicted moment pressed on one with so much force, this so permanent canvas gave one the most fleeting impression, one felt that the lady would presently move out of it, the boats drift away, the night draw on, that pleasure comes to an end, that life passes and that the moments illuminated by the convergence, at once, of so many lights do not recur. I recognized yet another aspect, quite different it is true, of what the moment means in a series of water-colours of mythological subjects, dating from Elstir\u2019s first period, which also adorned this room. Society people who held \u2018advanced\u2019 views on art went \u2018as far as\u2019 this earliest manner, but no further. These were certainly not the best work that he had done, but already the sincerity with which the subject had been thought out melted its natural coldness. Thus the Muses, for instance, were represented as it might be creatures belonging to a species now fossilised, but creatures which it would not have been surprising in mythological times to see pass in the evening, in twos or threes, along some mountain path. Here and there a poet, of a race that had also a peculiar interest for the zoologist (characterised by a certain sexlessness) strolled with a Muse, as one sees in nature creatures of different but of kindred species consort together. In one of these water-colours one saw a poet wearied by long wanderings on the mountains, whom a Centaur, meeting him and moved to pity by his weakness, had taken on his back and was carrying home. In more than one other, the vast landscape (in which the mythical scene, the fabulous heroes, occupied a minute place and were almost lost) was rendered, from the mountain tops to the sea, with an exactitude which told one more than the hour, told one to the very minute what time of day ft was, thanks to the precise angle of the setting sun, to the fleeting fidelity of the shadows. In this way the artist managed to give, by making it instantaneous, a sort of historical reality, as of a thing actually lived, to the symbol of his fable, painted it and set it at a definite point in the past\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I was examining Elstir\u2019s paintings the bell, rung by arriving guests had been pealing uninterruptedly, and had lulled me into a pleasing unconsciousness. But the silence which followed its clangour and had already lasted for some time succeeded \u2014 less rapidly, it is true \u2014 in awakening me from my dream, as the silence that follows Lindor\u2019s music arouses Bartolo from his sleep. I was afraid that I had been forgotten, that they had sat down to dinner, and hurried to the drawing-room. At the door of the Elstir gallery I found a servant waiting for me, white-haired, though whether with age or powder I cannot say, with the air of a Spanish Minister, but treating me with the same respect that he would have shewn to a King. I felt from his manner that he must have been waiting for at least an hour, and I thought with alarm of the delay I had caused in the service of dinner, especially as I had promised to be at M. de Charlus\u2019s by eleven\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Spanish Minister (though I also met on the way the footman persecuted by the porter, who, radiant with delight when I inquired after his girl, told me that the very next day they were both to be off duty, so that he would be able to spend the whole day with her, and extolled the generosity of Madame la Duchesse) conducted me to the drawing-room, where I was afraid of finding M. de Guermantes in an ill humour. He welcomed me, on the contrary, with a joy that was evidently to a certain extent artificial and dictated by politeness, but was also sincere, prompted both by his stomach which so long a delay had begun to famish, and his consciousness of a similar impatience in all his other guests, who completely filled the room. Indeed I heard afterwards that I had kept them waiting for nearly three-quarters of an hour. The Duc de Guermantes probably thought that to prolong the general torment for two minutes more would not intensify it and that, politeness having driven him to postpone for so long the moment of moving into the dining-room, this politeness would be more complete if, by not having dinner announced immediately, he could succeed in persuading me that I was not late, and that they had not been waiting for me. And so he asked me, as if we had still an hour before dinner and some of the party had not yet arrived, what I thought of his Elstirs. But at the same time, and without letting the cravings of his stomach become apparent, so as not to lose another moment, he, in concert with the Duchess, proceeded to the ceremony of introduction. Then only I perceived that there had occurred round about me, me who until this evening, save for my novitiate in Mme. Swann\u2019s drawing-room, had been accustomed, in my mother\u2019s homes, at Combray and in Paris, to the manners, either protecting or defensive, of the grim ladies of our middle-world, who treated me as a child, a change of surroundings comparable to that which introduces Parsifal suddenly into the midst of the Flower-Maidens. Those who surrounded me now, their bosoms entirely bare (the naked flesh appeared on either side of a sinuous spray of mimosa or behind the broad petals of a rose) could not murmur a word of greeting without at the same time bathing me in long, caressing glances, as though shyness alone restrained them from kissing me. Many of them were nevertheless highly respectable from the moral standpoint; many, not all, for the most virtuous had not for those of a lighter vein the same repulsion that my mother would have felt. The caprices of one\u2019s conduct, denied by saintlier friends, in the face of the evidence, seemed in the Guermantes world to matter far less than the relations which one had been able to maintain. One pretended not to know that the body of one\u2019s hostess was at the disposal of all comers, provided that her visiting list showed no gaps. As the Duke put himself out not at all for his other guests (of whom he had long known everything that there was to know, and they of him) but quite markedly for me, whose kind of superiority, being outside his experience, inspired in him something akin to the respect which the great nobleman of the court of Louis XIV used to feel for his plebeian Ministers, he evidently considered that the fact of my not knowing his other guests mattered not at all \u2014 to me at least, though it might to them \u2014 and while I was anxious, on his account, as to the impression that I was going to make on them he was thinking only of how his friends would impress me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the very outset I found myself completely bewildered. No sooner had I entered the drawing-room than M. de Guermantes, without even allowing me time to shake hands with the Duchess, had led me, as though I were a delightful surprise to the person in question to whom he seemed to be saying: \u201cHere\u2019s your friend! You see, I\u2019m bringing him to you by the scruff of his neck,\u201d towards a lady of smallish stature. Whereupon, long before, thrust forward by the Duke, I had reached her chair, the lady had begun to flash at me continuously from her large, soft, dark eyes the thousand smiles of understanding which we address to an old friend who perhaps has not recognised us. As this was precisely my case and I could not succeed in calling to mind who she was I averted my eyes from her as I approached so as not to have to respond until our introduction should have released me from my predicament. Meanwhile the lady continued to maintain in unstable equilibrium the smile intended for myself. She looked as though she were anxious to be relieved of it and to hear me say: \u201cOh, but this is a pleasure! Mamma will be pleased when I tell her I\u2019ve met you!\u201d I was as impatient to learn her name as she was to see that I did finally greet her, fully aware of what I was doing, so that the smile which she was holding on indefinitely, like the note of a tuning-fork, might at length be let go. But M. de Guermantes managed things so badly (to my mind, at least) that I seemed to have heard only my own name uttered and was given no clue to the identity of my unknown friend, to whom it never occurred to tell me herself what her name was, so obvious did the grounds of our intimacy, which baffled me completely, seem to her. Indeed, as soon as I had come within reach, she did not offer me her hand, but took mine in a familiar clasp, and spoke to me exactly as though I had been equally conscious with herself of the pleasant memories to which her mind reverted. She told me how sorry Albert (who, I gathered, was her son) would be to have missed seeing me. I tried to remember who, among the people I had known as boys, was called Albert, and could think only of Bloch, but this could not be Bloch\u2019s mother that I saw before me since she had been dead for some time. In vain I struggled to identify the past experience common to herself and me to which her thoughts had been carried back. But I could no more distinguish it through the translucent jet of her large, soft pupils which allowed only her smile to pierce their surface than one can distinguish a landscape that lies on the other side of a smoked glass, even when the sun is blazing on it. She asked me whether my father was not working too hard, if I would not come to the theatre some evening with Albert, if I was stronger now, and as my replies, stumbling through the mental darkness in which I was plunged, became distinct only to explain that I was not feeling well that evening, she pushed forward a chair for me herself, going to all sorts of trouble which I was not accustomed to see taken by my parents\u2019 friends. At length the clue to the riddle was furnished me by the Duke: \u201cShe thinks you\u2019re charming,\u201d he murmured in my ear, which felt somehow that it had heard these words before. They were what Mme. de Villeparisis had said to my grandmother and myself after we had made the acquaintance of the Princesse de Luxembourg. Everything became clear; the lady I now saw had nothing in common with Mme. de Luxembourg, but from the language of him who thus served me with her I could discern the nature of the animal. It was a Royalty. She had never before heard of either my family or myself, but, a scion of the noblest race and endowed with the greatest fortune in the world (for, a daughter of the Prince de Parme, she had married a cousin of equal princelihood), she sought always, in gratitude to her Creator, to testify to her neighbour, however poor or lowly he might be, that she did not look down upon him. Really, I might have guessed this from her smile. I had seen the Princesse de Luxembourg buy little rye-cakes on the beach at Balbec to give to my grandmother, as though to a caged deer in the zoological garden. But this was only the second Princess of the Blood Royal to whom I had been presented, and I might be excused my failure to discern in her the common factors of the friendliness of the great. Besides, had not they themselves gone out of their way to warn me not to count too much on this friendliness, since the Duchesse de Guermantes, who had waved me so effusive a greeting with her gloved hand at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, had appeared furious when I bowed to her in the street, like people who, having once given somebody a sovereign, feel that this has set them free from any further obligation toward him. As for M. de Charlus, his ups and downs were even more sharply contrasted. While in the sequel I have known, as the reader will learn, Highnesses and Majesties of another sort altogether, Queens who play the Queen and speak not after the conventions of their kind but like the Queens in Sardou\u2019s plays\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If M. de Guermantes had been in such haste to present me, it was because the presence at a party of anyone not personally known to a Royal Personage is an intolerable state of things which must not be prolonged for a single instant. It was similar to the haste which Saint-Loup had shewn in making me introduce him to my grandmother. By the same token, by a fragmentary survival of the old life of the court which is called social courtesy and is not superficial, in which, rather, by a centripetal reversion, it is the surface that becomes essential and profound, the Due and Duchesse de Guermantes regarded as a duty more essential than those (which one at least of the pair neglected often enough) of charity, chastity, pity and justice, as a more unalterable law that of never addressing the Princesse de Parme save in the third person\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having never yet in my life been to Parma (a pilgrimage I had been anxious to make ever since certain Easter holidays long ago), to meet its Princess, who, I knew, owned the finest palace in that matchless city, where, moreover, everything must be in keeping, isolated as it was from the rest of the world, within the polished walls, in the atmosphere, stifling as a breathless summer evening on the Piazza of a small town in Italy, of its compact and almost cloying name, would surely have substituted in a flash for what I had so often tried to imagine all that did really exist at Parma in a sort of partial arrival there, without my having to stir from Paris, of myself; it was in the algebraical expression of a journey to the city of Correggio a simple equation, so to speak, of that unknown quantity. But if I had for many years past \u2014 like a perfumer impregnating a solid mass of grease with scent \u2014 made this name, Princesse de Parme, absorb the fragrance of thousands of violets, in return, when I set eyes on the Princess, who, until then I should have sworn, must be the Sanseverina herself, a second process began which was not, I may say, completed until several months had passed, and consisted in expelling, by means of fresh chemical combinations, all the essential oil of violets and all the Stendhalian fragrance from the name of the Princess, and in implanting there, in their place, the image of a little dark woman, taken up with good works, of a friendliness so humble that one felt at once in how exalted a pride that friendliness had its roots. Moreover, while, barring a few points of difference, she was exactly like any other great lady, she was as little Stendhalian as is, for example, in Paris, in the Europe quarter, the Rue de Parme, which bears far less resemblance to the name of Parma than to any or all of the neighbouring streets, and reminds one not nearly so much of the Charterhouse in which Fabrice ends his days as of the waiting room in the Saint-Lazare station\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her friendliness sprang from two causes. The first and more general was the education which this daughter of Kings had received. Her mother (not merely allied by blood to all the royal families of Europe but furthermore \u2014 in contrast to the Ducal House of Parma \u2014 richer than any reigning Princess) had instilled into her from her earliest childhood the arrogantly humble precepts of an evangelical snobbery; and to-day every line of the daughter\u2019s face, the curve of her shoulders, the movements of her arms seemed to repeat the lesson: \u201cRemember that if God has caused you to be born on the steps of a throne you ought not to make that a reason for looking down upon those to whom Divine Providence has willed (wherefore His Name be praised) that you should be superior by birth and fortune. On the contrary, you must suffer the little ones. Your ancestors were Princes of Treves and Juliers from the year 647: God has decreed in His bounty that you should hold practically all the shares in the Suez Canal and three times as many Royal Dutch as Edmond de Rothschild; your pedigree in a direct line has been established by genealogists from the year 63 of the Christian Era; you have as sisters-in-law two Empresses. Therefore never seem, in your speech, to be recalling these great privileges, not that they are precarious (for nothing can alter antiquity of race, while the world will always need petrol), but because it is useless to point out that you are better born than other people or that your investments are all gilt-edged, since everyone knows these facts already. Be helpful to the needy. Furnish to all those whom the bounty of Heaven has done you the favour of placing beneath you as much as you can give them without forfeiture of your rank, that is to say help in the form of money, even your personal service by their sickbeds, but never (bear well in mind) invite them to your parties, which would do them no possible good and, by weakening your own position, would diminish the efficacy of your benevolent activities.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so even at the moments when she could not do good the Princess endeavoured to shew, or rather to let it be thought, by all the external signs of dumb language, that she did not consider herself superior to the people among whom she found herself thrown. She treated each of them with that charming courtesy with which well-bred people treat their inferiors and was continually, to make herself useful, pushing back her chair so as to leave more room, holding my gloves, offering me all those services which would demean the proud spirit of a commoner but are very willingly rendered by sovereign ladies or, instinctively and by force of professional habit, by retired servants\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But already the Duke, who seemed in a hurry to complete the round of introduction, had led me off to another of the flower-maidens. On hearing her name I told her that I had passed by her country house, not far from Balbec. \u201cOh, I should have been so pleased to take you over it,\u201d she informed me, almost in a whisper, to enhance her modesty, but in a tone of deep feeling, steeped in regret for the loss of an opportunity to enjoy a quite exceptional pleasure; and went on, with a meaning glance: \u201cI do hope you will come again some day. But I must say that what would interest you more still would be my aunt Brancas\u2019s place. It was built by Mansard; it is the jewel of the province.\u201d It was not only she herself who would have been glad to shew me over her house, but her aunt Brancas would have been no less delighted to do me the honours of hers, or so I was assured by this lady who thought evidently that, especially at a time when the land shewed a tendency to pass into the hands of financiers who had no knowledge of the world, it was important that the great should keep up the exalted traditions of lordly hospitality, by speeches which involved them in nothing. It was also because she sought, like everyone in her world, to say the things which would give most pleasure to the person she was addressing, to give him the highest idea of himself, to make him think that he flattered people by writing to them, that he honoured those who entertained him, that everyone was burning to know him. The desire to give other people this comforting idea of themselves does, it must be admitted, exist even among the middle classes. We find there that kindly disposition, in the form of an individual merit compensating for some other defect, not alas among the most trusty male friends but at any rate among the most agreeable female companions. But there anyhow it blooms only in isolated patches. In an important section of the aristocracy, on the other hand, this characteristic has ceased to be individual; cultivated by education, sustained by the idea of a personal greatness which can fear no humiliation, which knows no rival, is aware that by being pleasant it can make people happy and delights in doing so, it has become the generic feature of a class. And even those whom personal defects of too incompatible a kind prevent from keeping it in their hearts bear the unconscious trace of it in their vocabulary or their gesticulation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe is a very good creature,\u201d said the Duc de Guermantes, of the Princesse de Parme, \u201cand she can play the \u2018great lady\u2019 when she likes, better than anyone.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I was being introduced to the ladies, one of the gentlemen of the party had been shewing various signs of agitation: this was Comte Hannibal de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9-Consalvi. Arriving late, he had not had time to investigate the composition of the party, and when I entered the room, seeing in me a guest who was not one of the Duchess\u2019s regular circle and must therefore have some quite extraordinary claim to admission, installed his monocle beneath the groined arch of his eyebrow, thinking that this would be a great help to him in discovering what manner of man I was. He knew that Mme. de Guermantes possessed (the priceless appanage of truly superior women) what was called a \u2018salon,\u2019 that is to say added occasionally to the people of her own set some celebrity who had recently come into prominence by the discovery of a new cure for something or the production of a masterpiece. The Faubourg Saint-Germain had not yet recovered from the shock of learning that, to the reception which she had given to meet the King and Queen of England, the Duchess had not been afraid to invite M. D\u00e9taille. The clever women of the Faubourg who had not been invited were inconsolable, so deliciously thrilling would it have been to come into contact with that strange genius. Mme. de Courvoisier made out that M. Ribot had been there as well, but this was a pure invention, designed to make people believe that Oriane was aiming at an Embassy for her husband. Finally, a last straw of scandal, M. de Guermantes, with a gallantry that would have done credit to Marshal Saxe, had repaired to the green-room of the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise, and had begged Mlle. Reichemberg to come and recite before the King, which having come to pass constituted an event without precedent in the annals of routs. Remembering all these surprises, which, moreover, had his entire approval, his own presence being not merely an ornament but, in the same way as that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, a consecration to any drawing-room, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, when he asked himself who I could be, felt that the field of exploration was very wide. For a moment the name of M. Widor flashed before his mind, but he decided that I was not old enough to be an organist, and M. Widor not striking enough to be \u2018asked out.\u2019 It seemed on the whole more plausible to regard me simply as the new Attach\u00e9 at the Swedish Legation of whom he had heard, and he was preparing to ask me for the latest news of Oscar, by whom he had several times been very hospitably received; but when the Duke, in introducing me, had mentioned my name to M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, the latter, finding that name to be completely unknown to him had no longer any doubt that, being where I was, I must be a celebrity Of some sort. Oriane would certainly never invite anyone who was not, and had the art of attracting men who were in the public eye to her house, in a ratio that of course never exceeded one per cent, otherwise she would have lowered its tone. M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 began, therefore, to lick his chops and to sniff the air greedily, his appetite whetted not only by the good dinner upon which he could count, but by the character of the party, which my presence could not fail to make interesting, and which would furnish him with a topic for brilliant conversation next day at the Duc de Chartres\u2019s luncheon-table. He had not yet settled in his own mind whether I was the man who had just been making those experiments with a serum to cure cancer, or the author of the new \u2018curtain-raiser\u2019 then in rehearsal at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais; but, a great intellectual, a great collector of \u2018travellers\u2019 tales,\u2019 he continued an ever increasing display of reverences, signs of mutual understanding, smiles filtered through the glass of his monocle; either in the mistaken idea that a man of my standing would esteem him more highly if he could manage to instil into me the illusion that for him, the Comte de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9-Consalvi, the privileges of the mind were no less deserving of respect than those of birth; or simply from the need to express and difficulty of expressing his satisfaction, in his ignorance of the language in which he ought to address me, just as if, in fact, he had found himself face to face with one of the \u2018natives\u2019 of an undiscovered country on which his keel had grounded, natives from whom, in the hope of ultimate profit, he would endeavour, observing with interest the while their quaint customs and without interrupting his demonstrations of friendship, or like them uttering loud cries, to obtain ostrich eggs and spices in exchange for his glass beads. Having responded as best I could to his joy, I shook hands next with the Duc de Chatellerault, whom I had already met at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, who, he informed me, was as \u2018cunning as they made \u2019em.\u2019 He was typically Guermantes in the fairness of his hair, his arched profile, the points where the skin of his cheeks lost colour, all of which may be seen in the portraits of that family which have come down to us from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. But, as I was no longer in love with the Duchess, her reincarnation in the person of a young man offered me no attraction. I interpreted the hook made by the Duc de Chatellerault\u2019s nose, as if it had been the signature of a painter whose work I had long studied but who no longer interested me in the least. Next, I said good evening also to the Prince de Foix, and to the detriment of my knuckles, which emerged crushed and mangled, let them be caught in a vice which was the German handclasp, accompanied by an ironical or good-natured smile, of the Prince von Faffenheim, M. de Norpois\u2019s friend, who, by virtue of the mania for nicknames which prevailed in this set, was known so universally as Prince Von that he himself used to sign his letters \u2018Prince Von,\u2019 or, when he wrote to his intimates, \u2018Von.\u2019 And yet this abbreviation was understandable, in view of his triple-barrelled name. It was less easy to grasp the reasons which made \u2018Elizabeth\u2019 be replaced, now by \u2018Lili,\u2019 now by \u2018Bebeth,\u2019 just as another world swarmed with \u2018Kikis.\u2019 One can realise that these people, albeit in most respects idle and light-minded enough, might have come to adopt \u2018Quiou\u2019 in order not to waste the precious time that it would have taken them to pronounce \u2018Montesquieu.\u2019 But it is not so easy to see what they saved by naming one of their cousins \u2018Dinand\u2019 instead of \u2018Ferdinand.\u2019 It must not be thought, however, that in the invention of nicknames the Guermantes invariably proceed to curtail or reduplicate syllables. Thus two sisters, the Comtesse de Montpeyroux and the Vicomtesse de V\u00e9lude, who were both of them enormously stout, invariably heard themselves addressed, without the least trace of annoyance on their part or of amusement on other people\u2019s, so long established was the custom, as \u2018Petite\u2019 and \u2018Mignonne.\u2019 Mme. de Guermantes, who adored Mme. de Montpeyroux, would, if her friend had been seriously ill, have flown to the sister with tears in her eyes and exclaimed: \u201cI hear Petite is dreadfully bad!\u201d Mme. de l\u2019Eclin, who wore her hair in bands that entirely hid her ears, was never called anything but \u2018The Empty Stomach\u2019; in some cases people simply added an \u2018a\u2019 to the last or first name of the husband to indicate the wife. The most miserly, most sordid, most inhuman man in the Faubourg having been christened Raphael, his charmer, his flower springing also from the rock always signed herself \u2018Raphaela\u2019\u2014 but these are merely a few specimens taken from innumerable rules, to which we can always return later on, if the occasion offers, and explain some of them. I then asked the Duke to present me to the Prince d\u2019Agrigente. \u201cWhat! Do you mean to say you don\u2019t know our excellent Gri-gri!\u201d cried M. de Guermantes, and gave M. d\u2019Agrigente my name. His own, so often quoted by Fran\u00e7oise, had always appeared to me like a transparent sheet of coloured glass through which I beheld, struck, on the shore of the violet sea, by the slanting rays of a golden sun, the rosy marble cubes of an ancient city of which I had not the least doubt that the Prince \u2014 happening for a miraculous moment to be passing through Paris \u2014 was himself, as luminously Sicilian and gloriously mellowed, the absolute sovereign. Alas, the vulgar drone to whom I was introduced, and who wheeled round to bid me good evening with a ponderous ease which he considered elegant, was as independent of his name as of any work of art that he might have owned without bearing upon his person any trace of its beauty, without, perhaps, ever having stopped to examine it. The Prince d\u2019Agrigente was so entirely devoid of anything princely, anything that might make one think of Girgenti that one was led to suppose that his name, entirely distinct from himself, bound by no ties to his person, had had the power of attracting to itself the whole of whatever vague poetical element there might have been in this man as in any other, and isolating it, after the operation, in the enchanted syllables. If any such operation had been performed, it had certainly been done most efficiently, for there remained not an atom of charm to be drawn from this kinsman of Guermantes. With the result that he found himself at one and the same time the only man in the world who was Prince d\u2019Agrigente and the man who, of all the men in the world was, perhaps, least so. He was, for all that, very glad to be what he was, but as a banker is glad to hold a number of shares in a mine without caring whether the said mine answers to the charming name of Ivanhoe or Primrose, or is called merely the Premier. Meanwhile, as these introductions, which it has taken me so long to recount but which, beginning as I entered the room, had lasted only a few seconds, were coming to an end, and Mme. de Guermantes, in an almost suppliant tone, was saying to me: \u201cI am sure Basin is tiring you, dragging you round like that; we are anxious for you to know our friends, but we are a great deal more anxious not to tire you, so that you may come again often,\u201d the Duke, with a somewhat awkward and timid wave of the hand, gave (as he would gladly have given it at any time during the last hour, filled for me by the contemplation of his Elstirs) the signal that dinner might now be served\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should add that one of the guests was still missing, M. de Grouchy, whose wife, a Guermantes by birth, had arrived by herself, her husband being due to come straight from the country, where he had been shooting all day. This M. de Grouchy, a descendant of his namesake of the First Empire, of whom it has been said, quite wrongly, that his absence at the start of the Battle of Waterloo was the principal cause of Napoleon\u2019s defeat, came of an excellent family which, however, was not good enough in the eyes of certain fanatics for blue blood. Thus the Prince de Guermantes, whose own tastes, in later life, were to prove more easily satisfied, had been in the habit of saying to his nieces: \u201cWhat a misfortune for that poor Mme. de Guermantes\u201d (the Vicomtesse de Guermantes, Mme. de Grouchy\u2019s mother) \u201cthat she has never succeeded in marrying any of her children.\u201d \u201cBut, uncle, the eldest girl married M. de Grouchy.\u201d \u201cI do not call that a husband! However, they say that your uncle Fran\u00e7ois has proposed for the youngest one, so perhaps they won\u2019t all die old maids.\u201d No sooner was the order to serve dinner given than with a vast gyratory whirr, multiple and simultaneous, the double doors of the dining-room swung apart; a chamberlain with the air of a Lord Chamberlain bowed before the Princesse de Parme and announced the tidings \u201cMadame is served,\u201d in a tone such as he would have employed to say \u201cMadame is dead,\u201d which, however, cast no gloom over the assembly for it was with an air of unrestrained gaiety and as, in summer, at \u2018Robinson\u2019 that the couples moved forward one behind another to the dining-room, separating when they had reached their places where footmen thrust their chairs in behind them; last of all, Mme. de Guermantes advanced upon me, that I might lead her to the table, and without my feeling the least shadow of the timidity that I might have feared, for, like a huntress to whom her great muscular prowess has made graceful motion an easy thing, observing no doubt that I had placed myself on the wrong side of her, she pivoted with such accuracy round me that I found her arm resting on mine and attuned in the most natural way to a rhythm of precise and noble movements. I yielded to these with all the more readiness in that the Guermantes attached no more importance to them than does to learning a truly learned man in whose company one is less alarmed than in that of a dunce; other doors opened through which there entered the steaming soup, as though the dinner were being held in a puppet-theatre of skilful mechanism where the belated arrival of the young guest set, on a signal from the puppet-master, all the machinery in motion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Timid and not majestically sovereign had been this signal from the Duke, to which had responded the unlocking of that vast, ingenious, subservient and sumptuous clockwork, mechanical and human. The indecision of his gesture did not spoil for me the effect of the spectacle that was attendant upon it. For I could feel that what had made it hesitating and embarrassed was the fear of letting me see that they were waiting only for myself to begin dinner and that they had been waiting for some time, just as Mme. de Guermantes was afraid that after looking at so many pictures I would find it tiring and would be hindered from taking my ease among them if her husband engaged me in a continuous flow of introductions. So that it was the absence of grandeur in this gesture that disclosed its true grandeur. As, also, did that indifference shewn by the Duke to the splendour of his surroundings, in contrast to his deference towards a guest, however insignificant, whom he desired to honour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not that M. de Guermantes was not in certain respects thoroughly commonplace, shewing indeed some of the absurd weaknesses of a man with too much money, the arrogance of an upstart, which he certainly was not. But just as a public official or a priest sees his own humble talents multiplied to infinity (as a wave is by the whole mass of the sea which presses behind it) by those forces on which they can rely, the Government of France and the Catholic Church, so M. de Guermantes was borne on by that other force, aristocratic courtesy in its truest form. This courtesy drew the line at any number of people. Mme. de Guermantes would not have asked to her house Mme. de Cambremer, or M. de Forcheville. But the moment that anyone (as was the case with me) appeared eligible for admission into the Guermantes world, this courtesy revealed treasures of hospitable simplicity more splendid still, were that possible, than those historic rooms, or the marvellous furniture that had remained in them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he wished to give pleasure to anyone, M. de Guermantes possessed, in this way, for making his guest for the moment the principal person present, an art which made the most of the circumstances and the place. No doubt at Guermantes his \u2018distinctions\u2019 and \u2018favours\u2019 would have assumed another form. He would have ordered his carriage to take me for a drive, alone with himself, before dinner. Such as they were, one could not help feeling touched by his manners as one is in reading memoirs of the period by those of Louis XIV when he replies good-naturedly, smiling and almost with a bow, to some one who has come to solicit his favour. It must however in both instances be borne in mind that this \u2018politeness\u2019 did not go beyond the strict meaning of the word\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Louis XIV (with whom the sticklers for pure nobility of his day find fault, nevertheless, for his scant regard for etiquette, so much so that, according to Saint-Simon, he was only a very minor king, as kings go, when compared with such monarchs as Philippe de Valois or Charles V), has the most minute instructions drawn up so that Princes of the Blood and Ambassadors may know to what sovereigns they ought to give precedence. In certain cases, in view of the impossibility of arriving at a decision a compromise is arranged by which the son of Louis XIV, Monseigneur, shall entertain certain foreign sovereigns only out of doors, in the open air, so that it may not be said that in entering the house one has preceded the other; and the Elector Palatine, entertaining the Duc de Chevreuse at dinner, pretends, so as not to have to make way for his guest, to be taken ill, and dines with him indeed, but dines lying down, thus avoiding the difficulty. M. le Duc evading opportunities of paying his duty to Monsieur the latter, on the advice of the King, his brother, who is moreover extremely attached to him, seizes an excuse for making his cousin attend his levee and forcing him to pass him his shirt. But as soon as the feeling is deep, when the heart is involved, this rule of duty, so inflexible when politeness only is at stake, changes entirely. A few hours after the death of his brother, one of the people whom he most dearly loved, when Monsieur, in the words of the Duc de Montfort, is \u2018still warm,\u2019 we find Louis XIV singing snatches from operas, astonished that the Duchesse de Bourgogne, who has difficulty in concealing her grief, should be looking so woe-begone, and, desiring that the gaiety of the court shall be at once resumed, so that his courtiers may be encouraged to sit down to the tables, ordering the Duc de Bourgogne to start a game of brelan. Well, not only in his social and concentrated activities, but in the most spontaneous utterances, the ordinary preoccupations of M. de Guermantes, the use he made of his time, one found a similar contrast; the Guermantes were no more susceptible than other mortals to grief; one might indeed say that their actual sensibility was lower; on the other hand one saw their names every day in the social columns of the Gaulois on account of the prodigious number of funerals at which they would have felt it a neglect of duty not to have their presence recorded. As the traveller discovers, almost unaltered, the houses roofed with turf, the terraces which may have met the eyes of Xenophon or Saint Paul, so in the manners of M. de Guermantes, a man who melted one\u2019s heart by his courtesy and revolted it by his harshness, I found still intact after the lapse of more than two centuries that deviation typical of court life under Louis XIV which transfers all scruples of conscience from matters of the affections and morality and applies them to purely formal questions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other reason for the friendliness shewn me by the Princesse de Parme was of a more personal kind. It was that she was convinced beforehand that everything that she saw at the Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019s, people and things alike, was of a quality superior to that of anything that she had at home. It is true that in all the other houses of her acquaintance she behaved as if this had been the case; over the simplest dish, the most ordinary flowers, she was not satisfied with going into ecstasies, she would ask leave to send round next morning, to copy the recipe or to examine the variety of blossom, her head cook or head gardener, gentlemen with large salaries who kept their own carriages and were deeply humiliated at having to come to inquire after a dish they despised or to take notes of a kind of carnation that was not half so fine, had not such ornamental streaks, did not produce so large a blossom as those which they had long been growing for her at home. But if in the Princess, wherever she went, this astonishment at the sight of the most commonplace things was assumed, and intended to shew that she did not derive from the superiority of her rank and riches a pride forbidden by her early instructors, habitually dissembled by her mother and intolerable in the sight of her Creator, it was, on the other hand, in all sincerity that she regarded the drawing-room of the Duchesse de Guermantes as a privileged place in which she could pass only from surprise to delight. To a certain extent, for that matter, though not nearly enough to justify this state of mind, the Guermantes were different from the rest of noble society, they were rarer and more refined. They had given me at first sight the opposite impression; I had found them vulgar, similar to all other men and women, but because before meeting them I had seen in them, as in Balbec, in Florence, in Parma, only names. Evidently, in this drawing-room, all the women whom I had imagined as being like porcelain figures were even more like the great majority of women. But, in the same way as Balbec or Florence, the Guermantes, after first disappointing the imagination because they resembled their fellow-creatures rather than their name, could subsequently, though to a less degree, appeal to the intellect by certain distinctive characteristics. Their bodily structure, the colour \u2014 a peculiar pink that merged at times into violet \u2014 of their skins, a certain almost flashing fairness of the finely spun hair, even in the men, on whom it was massed in soft golden tufts, half a wall-growing lichen, half a catlike fur (a luminous sparkle to which corresponded a certain brilliance of intellect, for if people spoke of the Guermantes complexion, the Guermantes hair, they spoke also of the wit of the Guermantes, as of the wit of the Mortemarts \u2014 a certain social quality whose superior fineness was famed even before the days of Louis XIV and all the more universally recognised since they published the fame of it themselves), all this meant that in the material itself, precious as that might be, in which one found them embedded here and there, the Guermantes remained recognisable, easy to detect and to follow, like the veins whose paleness streaks a block of jasper or onyx, or, better still, like the pliant waving of those tresses of light whose loosened hairs run like flexible rays along the sides of a moss-agate\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Guermantes \u2014 those at least who were worthy of the name \u2014 were not only of a quality of flesh, of hair, of transparency of gaze that was exquisite, but had a way of holding themselves, of walking, of bowing, of looking at one before they shook one\u2019s hand, of shaking hands, which made them as different in all these respects from an ordinary person in society as he in turn was from a peasant in a smock. And despite their friendliness one asked oneself: \u201cHave they not indeed the right, though they waive it, when they see us walk, bow, leave a room, do any of those things which when performed by them become as graceful as the flight of a swallow or the bending of a rose on its stem, to think: \u2018These people are of another race than ours, and we are, we, the true lords of creation.\u2019?\u201d Later on, I realised that the Guermantes did indeed regard me as being of another race, but one that aroused their envy because I possessed merits of which I knew nothing and which they professed to regard as alone important. Later still I came to feel that this profession of faith was only half sincere and that in them scorn or surprise could be coexistent with admiration and envy The physical flexibility essential to the Guermantes was twofold; thanks to one of its forms, constantly in action, at any moment and if, for example, a male Guermantes were about to salute a lady, he produced a silhouette of himself made from the unstable equilibrium of a series of asymmetrical movements with nervous compensations, one leg dragging a little either on purpose or because, having been broken so often in the hunting-field, it imparted to his trunk in its effort to keep pace with the other a deviation to which the upward thrust of one shoulder gave a counterpoise, while the monocle settled itself before his eye, raising an eyebrow just as the tuft of hair on the forehead was lowered in the formal bow; the other flexibility, like the form of the wave, the wind or the ocean track which is preserved on the shell or the vessel, was so to speak stereotyped in a sort of fixed mobility, curving the arched nose which, beneath the blue, protruding eyes, above the over-thin lips, from which, in the women, there emerged a raucous voice, recalled the fabulous origin attributed in the sixteenth century by the complaisance of parasitic and Hellenising genealogists to his race, ancient beyond dispute, but not to the degree of antiquity which they claimed when they gave as its source the mythological impregnation of a nymph by a divine Bird\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Guermantes were just as idiomatic from the intellectual as from the physical point of view. With the exception of Prince Gilbert (the husband with antiquated ideas of \u2018Marie-Gilbert,\u2019 who made his wife sit on his left when they drove out together because her blood, though royal, was inferior to his own)\u2014 but he was an exception and furnished, behind his back, a perpetual laughing-stock to the rest of the family, who had always fresh anecdotes to tell of him \u2014 the Guermantes, while living in the pure cream of aristocracy, affected to take no account of nobility. The theories of the Duchesse de Guermantes, who, to tell the truth, by dint of being a Guermantes, became to a certain extent something different and more attractive, subordinated everything else so completely to intellect, and were in politics so socialistic that one asked oneself where in her mansion could be hiding the familiar spirit whose duty it was to ensure the maintenance of the aristocratic standard of living, and which, always invisible but evidently crouching at one moment in the entrance hall, at another in the drawing-room, at a third in her dressing-room, reminded the servants of this woman who did not believe in titles to address her as Mme. la Duchesse, reminding also herself who cared only for reading and had no respect for persons to go out to dinner with her sister-in-law when eight o\u2019clock struck, and to put on a low gown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same familiar spirit represented to Mme. de Guermantes the social duties of duchesses, of the foremost among them, that was, who like herself were multi-millionaires, the sacrifice to boring tea, dinner and evening parties of hours in which she might have read interesting books, as unpleasant necessities like rain, which Mme. de Guermantes accepted, letting play on them her biting humour, but without seeking in any way to justify her acceptance of them. The curious accident by which the butler of Mme. de Guermantes invariably said \u201cMadame la Duchesse\u201d to this woman who believed only in the intellect did not however appear to shock her. Never had it entered her head to request him to address her simply as \u2018Madame.\u2019 Giving her the utmost benefit of the doubt one might have supposed that, thinking of something else at the time, she had heard only the word \u2018Madame\u2019 and that the suffix appended to it had not caught her attention. Only, though she might feign deafness, she was not dumb. In fact, whenever she had a message to give to her husband she would say to the butler: \u201cRemind Monsieur le Duc \u2014\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The familiar spirit had other occupations as well, one of which was to inspire them to talk morality. It is true that there were Guermantes who went in for intellect and Guermantes who went in for morals, and that these two classes did not as a rule coincide. But the former kind \u2014 including a Guermantes who had forged cheques, who cheated at cards and was the most delightful of them all, with a mind open to every new and sound idea \u2014 spoke even more eloquently upon morals than the others, and in the same strain as Mme. de Villeparisis, at the moments in which the familiar spirit expressed itself through the lips of the old lady. At corresponding moments one saw the Guermantes adopt suddenly a tone almost as old-ladylike, as genial and (as they themselves had more charm) more touching than that of the Marquise, to say of a servant: \u201cOne feels that she has a thoroughly sound nature, she\u2019s not at all a common girl, she must come of decent parents, she is certainly a girl who has never gone astray.\u201d At such moments the familiar spirit took the form of an intonation. But at times it could be bearing also, the expression on a face, the same in the Duchess as in her grandfather the Marshal, a sort of undefinable convulsion (like that of the Serpent, the genius of the Carthaginian family of Barca) by which my heart had more than once been set throbbing, on my morning walks, when before I had recognised Mme. de Guermantes I felt her eyes fastened upon me from the inside of a little dairy. This familiar spirit had intervened in a situation which was far from immaterial not merely to the Guermantes but to the Courvoisiers, the rival faction of the family and, though of as good blood as the Guermantes (it was, indeed, through his Courvoisier grandmother that the Guermantes explained the obsession which led the Prince de Guermantes always to speak of birth and titles as though those were the only things that mattered), their opposite in every respect. Not only did the Courvoisiers not assign to intelligence the same importance as the Guermantes, they had not the same idea of it. For a Guermantes (even were he a fool) to be intelligent meant to have a sharp tongue, to be capable of saying cutting things, to \u2018get away with it\u2019; but it meant also the capacity to hold one\u2019s own equally in painting, music, architecture, to speak English. The Courvoisiers had formed a less favourable impression of intelligence, and unless one were actually of their world being intelligent was almost tantamount to \u2018having probably murdered one\u2019s father and mother.\u2019 For them intelligence was the sort of burglar\u2019s jemmy by means of which people one did not know from Adam forced the doors of the most reputable drawing-rooms, and it was common knowledge among the Courvoisiers that you always had to pay in the long run for having \u2018those sort\u2019 of people in your house. To the most trivial statements made by intelligent people who were not \u2018in society\u2019 the Courvoisiers opposed a systematic distrust. Some one having on one occasion remarked: \u201cBut Swann is younger than Palam\u00e8de,\u201d\u2014\u201cHe says so, at any rate, and if he says it you may be sure it\u2019s because he thinks it is to his interest!\u201d had been Mme. de Gallardon\u2019s retort. Better still, when some one said of two highly distinguished foreigners whom the Guermantes had entertained that one of them had been sent in first because she was the elder: \u201cBut is she really the elder?\u201d Mme. de Gallardon had inquired, not positively as though that sort of person did not have any age but as if presumably devoid of civil or religious status, of definite traditions, they were both more or less young, like two kittens of the same litter between which only a veterinary surgeon was competent to decide. The Courvoisiers, more than the Guermantes, maintained also in a certain sense the integrity of the titled class thanks at once to the narrowness of their minds and the bitterness of their hearts. Just as the Guermantes (for whom, below the royal families and a few others like the Lignes, the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles and so forth, all the rest were lost in a common rubbish-heap) were insolent towards various people of long descent who lived round Guermantes, simply because they paid no attention to those secondary distinctions by which the Courvoisiers were enormously impressed, so the absence of such distinctions affected them little. Certain women who did not hold any specially exalted rank in their native provinces but, brilliantly married, rich, good-looking, beloved of Duchesses, were for Paris, where people are never very well up in who one\u2019s \u2018father and mother\u2019 were, an excellent and exclusive piece of \u2018imported goods.\u2019 It might happen, though not commonly, that such women were, through the channel of the Princesse de Parme or by virtue of their own attractions, received by certain Guermantes. But with regard to these the indignation of the Courvoisiers knew no bounds. Having to meet, between five and six in the afternoon, at their cousin\u2019s, people with whose relatives their own relatives did not care to be seen mixing down in the Perche became for them an ever-increasing source of rage and an inexhaustible fount of rhetoric. The moment, for instance, when the charming Comtesse G\u2014\u2014-entered the Guermantes drawing-room, the face of Mme. de Villebon assumed exactly the expression that would have befitted it had she been called to recite the line:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And should but one stand fast, that one were surely I\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0a line which for that matter was unknown to her. This Courvoisier had consumed almost every Monday an \u00e9clair stuffed with cream within a few feet of the Comtesse G\u2014 \u2014 but to no consequence. And Mme. de Villebon confessed in secret that she could not conceive how her cousin Guermantes could allow a woman into her house who was not even in the second-best society of Ch\u00e2teaudun. \u201cI really fail to see why my cousin should make such a fuss about whom she knows; it\u2019s making a perfect farce of society!\u201d concluded Mme. de Villebon with a change of facial expression, this time a sly smile of despair, which, in a charade, would have been interpreted rather as indicating another line of poetry, though one with which she was no more familiar than with the first:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gr\u00e2ce aux Dieux mon malheur passe mon esp\u00e9rance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We may here anticipate events to explain that the pers\u00e9v\u00e9rance, (which rhymes, in the following line with esp\u00e9rance) shewn by Mme. de Villebon in snubbing Mme. G\u2014\u2014-was not entirely wasted. In the eyes of Mme. G\u2014\u2014\u2014 it invested Mme. de Villebon with a distinction so supreme, though purely imaginary, that when the time came for Mme. G\u2014\u2014-\u2018s daughter, who was the prettiest girl and the greatest heiress in the ballrooms of that season, to marry, people were astonished to see her refuse all the Dukes in succession. The fact was that her mother, remembering the weekly humiliations she had had to endure in the Rue de Grenelle on account of Chateaudun could think of only one possible husband for her daughter \u2014 a Villebon son\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A single point at which Guermantes and Courvoisiers converged was the art (one, for that matter, of infinite variety) of marking distances. The Guermantes manners were not absolutely uniform towards everyone. And yet, to take an example, all the Guermantes, all those who really were Guermantes, when you were introduced to them proceeded to perform a sort of ceremony almost as though the fact that they held out their hands to you had been as important as the conferring of an order of knighthood. At the moment when a Guermantes, were he no more than twenty, but treading already in the footsteps of his ancestors, heard your name uttered by the person who introduced you, he let fall on you as though he had by no means made up his mind to say \u201cHow d\u2019ye do?\u201d a gaze generally blue, always of the coldness of a steel blade which he seemed ready to plunge into the deepest recesses of your heart. Which was a matter of fact what the Guermantes imagined themselves to be doing, each of them regarding himself as a psychologist of the highest order. They thought moreover that they increased by this inspection the affability of the salute which was to follow it, and would not be rendered you without full knowledge of your deserts. All this occurred at a distance from yourself which, little enough had it been a question of a passage of arms, seemed immense for a handclasp, and had as chilling an effect in this connexion as in the other, so that when the Guermantes, after a rapid twisting thrust that explored the most intimate secrets of your soul and laid bare your title to honour, had deemed you worthy to associate with him thereafter, his hand, directed towards you at the end of an arm stretched out to its fullest extent, appeared to be presenting a rapier at you for a single combat, and that hand was in fact placed so far in advance of the Guermantes himself at that moment that when he afterwards bowed his head it was difficult to distinguish whether it was yourself or his own hand that he was saluting. Certain Guermantes, lacking the sense of proportion, or being incapable of refraining from repeating themselves incessantly, went further and repeated this ceremony afresh every time that they met you. Seeing that they had no longer any need to conduct the preliminary psychological investigation for which the \u2018familiar spirit\u2019 had delegated its powers to them and the result of which they had presumably kept in mind, the insistence of the perforating gaze preceding the handclasp could be explained only by the automatism which their gaze had acquired or by some power of fascination which they believed themselves to possess. The Courvoisiers whose physique was different, had tried in vain to assimilate that searching gaze and had had to fall back upon a lordly stiffness or a rapid indifference On the other hand, it was from the Courvoisiers that certain very exceptional Guermantes of the gentler sex seemed to have borrowed the feminine form of greeting. At the moment when you were presented to one of these she made you a sweeping bow in which she carried towards you, almost to an angle of forty-five degrees, her head and bust, the rest of her body (which came very high, up to the belt which formed a pivot) remaining stationary. But no sooner had she projected thus towards you the upper part of her person than she flung it backwards beyond the vertical line by a sudden retirement through almost the same angle. This subsequent withdrawal neutralised what appeared to have been conceded to you; the ground which you believed yourself to have gained did not even remain a conquest, as in a duel; the original positions were retained. This same annulment of affability by the resumption of distance (which was Courvoisier in origin and intended to shew that the advances made in the first movement were no more than a momentary feint) displayed itself equally clearly, in the Courvoisier ladies as in the Guermantes, in the letters which you received from them, at any rate in the first period of your acquaintance. The \u2018body\u2019 of the letter might contain sentences such as one writes only (you would suppose) to a friend, but in vain might you have thought yourself entitled to boast of being in that relation to the lady, since the letter began with \u2018Monsieur,\u2019 and ended with \u2018Croyez monsieur \u00e0 mes sentiments distingu\u00e9s.\u2019 After which, between this cold opening and frigid conclusion which altered the meaning of all the rest, there might come in succession (were it a reply to a letter of condolence from yourself) the most touching pictures of the grief which the Guermantes lady had felt on losing her sister, of the intimacy that had existed between them, of the beauty of the place in which she was staying, of the consolation that she found in the charm of her young children, all this amounted to no more than a letter such as one finds in printed collections, the intimate character of which implied, however, no more intimacy between yourself and the writer than if she had been the Younger Pliny or Mme. de Simiane\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that certain Guermantes ladies wrote to you from the first as \u2018My dear friend,\u2019 or \u2018My friends\u2019; these were not always the most simple natured among them, but rather those who, living only in the society of kings and being at the same time \u2018light,\u2019 assumed in their pride the certainty that everything which came from themselves gave pleasure and in their corruption the habit of setting no price upon any of the satisfactions that they had to offer. However, since to have had a common ancestor in the reign of Louis XIII was enough to make a young Guermantes say, in speaking of the Marquise de Guermantes: \u201cMy aunt Adam,\u201d the Guermantes were so numerous a clan that, even among these simple rites, that for example of the bow upon introduction to a stranger, there existed a wide divergence. Each subsection of any refinement had its own, which was handed down from parents to children like the prescription for a liniment or a special way of making jam. Thus it was that we saw Saint-Loup\u2019s handclasp thrust out as though involuntarily at the moment of his hearing one\u2019s name, without any participation by his eyes, without the addition of a bow. Any unfortunate commoner who for a particular reason \u2014 which, for that matter, very rarely occurred \u2014 was presented to anyone of the Saint-Loup subsection racked his brains over this abrupt minimum of a greeting, which deliberately assumed the appearance of non-recognition, to discover what in the world the Guermantes \u2014 male or female \u2014 could have against him. And he was highly surprised to learn that the said Guermantes had thought fit to write specially to the introducer to tell him how delighted he or she had been with the stranger, \u2022 whom he or she looked forward to meeting again. As specialised as the mechanical gestures of Saint-Loup were the complicated and rapid capers (which M. de Charlus condemned as ridiculous) of the Marquis de Fierbois, the grave and measured paces of the Prince de Guermantes. But it is impossible to describe here the richness of the choreography of the Guermantes ballet owing to the sheer length of the cast\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to the antipathy which animated the Courvoisiers against the Duchesse de Guermantes, they might have had the consolation of feeling sorry for her so long as she was still unmarried, for she was then comparatively poor. Unfortunately, at all times and seasons, a sort of fuliginous emanation, quite sut generis, enveloped, hid from the eye the wealth of the Courvoisiers which, however great it might be, remained obscure. In vain might a young Courvoisier with an ample dowry find a most eligible bridegroom; it invariably happened that the young couple had no house of their own in Paris, \u2018came up to stay\u2019 in the season with his parents, and for the rest of the year lived down in the country in the thick of a society that may have been unadulterated but was also quite undistinguished. Whereas a Saint-Loup who was up to the eyes in debt dazzled Donci\u00e8res with his carriage-horses, a Courvoisier who was extremely rich always went in the tram. Similarly (though of course many years earlier) Mlle, de Guermantes (Oriane), who had scarcely a penny to her name, created more stir with her clothes than all the Courvoisiers put together. The really scandalous things she said gave a sort of advertisement to her style of dressing and doing her hair. She had had the audacity to say to the Russian Grand Duke: \u201cWell, Sir, I hear you would like to have Tolstoy murdered?\u201d at a dinner-party to which none of the Courvoisiers, not that any of them knew very much about Tolstoy, had been asked. They knew little more about Greek writers, if we may judge by the Dowager Duchesse de Gallardon (mother-in-law of the Princesse de Gallardon who at that time was still a girl) who, not having been honoured by Oriane with a single visit in five years, replied to some one who asked her the reason for this abstention: \u201cIt seems she recites Aristotle\u201d (meaning Aristophanes) \u201cin society. I cannot allow that sort of thing in my house!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One can imagine how greatly this \u2018sally\u2019 by Mlle. de Guermantes upon Tolstoy, if it enraged the Courvoisiers, delighted the Guermantes, and by derivation everyone who was not merely closely but even remotely attached to them. The Dowager Comtesse d\u2019Argencourt (n\u00e9e Seineport) who entertained a little of everything, because she was a blue-stocking and in spite of her son\u2019s being a terrible snob, repeated the saying before her literary friends with the comment: \u201cOriane de Guermantes, you know; she\u2019s as fine as amber, as mischievous as a monkey, there\u2019s nothing she couldn\u2019t do if she chose, her water-colours are worthy of a great painter and she writes better verses than most of the great poets, and as for family, don\u2019t you know, you couldn\u2019t imagine anything better, her grandmother was Mlle, de Montpensier, and she is the eighteenth Oriane de Guermantes in succession, without a single misalliance; it\u2019s the purest blood, the oldest in the whole of France.\u201d And so the sham men of letters, those demi-intellectuals who went to Mme. d\u2019Argencourt\u2019s, forming a mental picture of Oriane de Guermantes, whom they would never have an opportunity to know personally, as something more wonderful and more extraordinary than Princess Badroulbadour, not only felt themselves ready to die for her on learning that so noble a person glorified Tolstoy above all others, but felt also quickening with a fresh strength in their minds their own love of Tolstoy, their longing to fight against Tsarism. These liberal ideas might have grown faint in them, they might have begun to doubt their importance, no longer venturing to confess to holding them, when suddenly from Mlle, de Guermantes herself, that is to say from a girl so indisputably cultured and authorised to speak, who wore her hair flat on her brow (a thing that no Courvoisier would ever have consented to do), came this vehement support. A certain number of realities, good or bad in themselves, gain enormously in this way by receiving the adhesion of people who are in authority over us. For instance among the Courvoisiers the rites of affability in a public thoroughfare consisted in a certain bow, very ugly and far from affable in itself but which people knew to be the distinguished way of bidding a person good day, with the result that everyone else, suppressing the instinctive smile of welcome on his own face, endeavoured to imitate these frigid gymnastics. But the Guermantes in general and Oriane in particular, while better conversant than anyone with these rites, did not hesitate, if they caught sight of you from a carriage, to greet you with a sprightly wave of the hand, and in a drawing-room, leaving the Courvoisiers to make their stiff and imitative bows, sketched charming reverences in the air, held out their hands as though to a comrade with a smile from their blue eyes, so that suddenly, thanks to the Guermantes, there entered into the substance of smartness, until then a little hollow and dry, everything that you would naturally have liked and had compelled yourself to forego, a genuine welcome, the effusion of a true friendliness, spontaneity. It is in a similar fashion (but by a rehabilitation which this time is scarcely justified) that people who carry in themselves an instinctive taste for bad music and for melodies, however commonplace, which have in them something easy and caressing, succeed, by dint of education in symphonic culture, in mortifying that appetite. But once they have arrived at this point, when, dazzled \u2014 and rightly so \u2014 by the brilliant orchestral colouring of Richard Strauss, they see that musician adopt with an indulgence worthy of Auber the most vulgar motifs, what those people originally admired finds suddenly in so high an authority a justification which delights them, and they let themselves be enchanted without scruple and with a twofold gratitude, when they listen to Salom\u00e9, by what it would have been impossible for them to admire in Les Diamants de la Couronne. Authentic or not, the retort made by Mlle, de Guermantes to the Grand Duke, retailed from house to house, furnished an opportunity to relate the excessive smartness with which Oriane had been turned out at the dinner-party in question. But if such splendour (and this is precisely what rendered it unattainable by the Courvoisiers) springs not from wealth but from prodigality, the latter does nevertheless last longer if it enjoys the constant support of the former, which allows it to spend all its fire. Given the principles openly advertised not. only by Oriane but by Mlle, de Villeparisis, namely that nobility does not count, that it is ridiculous to bother one\u2019s head about rank, that wealth does not necessarily mean happiness, that intellect, heart, talent are alone of importance, the Courvoisiers were justified in hoping that, as a result of the training she had received from the Marquise, Oriane would marry some one who was not in society, an artist, a fugitive from justice, a scallawag, a free-thinker, that she would pass definitely into the category of what the Courvoisiers called \u2018detrimentals.\u2019 They were all the more justified in this hope since, inasmuch as Mme. de Villeparisis was at this very moment, from the social point of view, passing through an awkward crisis (none of the few bright stars whom I was to meet in her drawing-room had as yet reappeared there), she professed an intense horror of the society which was thus holding her aloof. Even when she referred to her nephew the Prince de Guermantes, whom she did still see, she could never make an end of mocking at him because he was so infatuated about his pedigree. But the moment it became a question of finding a husband for Oriane, it had been no longer the principles publicly advertised by aunt and niece that had controlled the operations, it had been the mysterious \u2018familiar spirit\u2019 of their race. As unerringly as if Mme. de Villeparisis and Oriane had never spoken of anything but rent-rolls and pedigrees in place of literary merit and depth of character, and as if the Marquise, for the space of a few days, had been \u2014 as she would ultimately be \u2014 dead and on her bier, in the church of Combray, where each member of the family would be reduced to a mere Guermantes, with a forfeiture of individuality and baptismal names to which there testified on the voluminous black drapery of the pall the single \u2018G\u2019 in purple surmounted by the ducal coronet, it was on the wealthiest man and the most nobly born, on the most eligible bachelor of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, on the eldest son of the Duc de Guermantes, the Prince des Laumes, that the familiar spirit had let fall the choice of the intellectual, the critical, the evangelical Mme. de Villeparisis. And for a couple of hours, on the day of the wedding, Mme. de Villeparisis received in her drawing-room all the noble persons at whom she had been in the habit of sneering, at whom she indeed sneered still to the various plebeian intimates whom she had invited and on whom the Prince des Laumes promptly left cards, preparatory to \u2018cutting the cable\u2019 in the following year. And then, making the Courvoisiers\u2019 cup of bit terness overflow, the same old maxims, which made out intellect and talent to be the sole claims to social pre-eminence, resumed their doctrinal fore in the household of the Princesse des Laumes immediately after her mar riage. And in this respect, be it said in passing, the point of view which Saint-Loup upheld when he lived with Rachel, frequented the friends of Rachel, would have liked to marry Rachel, implied \u2014 whatever the horror that it inspired in the family \u2014 less falsehood than that of the Guermantes young ladies in general, preaching the virtues of intellect, barely admitting the possibility of anyone\u2019s questioning the equality of mankind, all of which ended at a given point in the same result as if they had professed the opposite principles, that is to say in marriage to an extremely wealthy duke. Saint-Loup did, on the contrary, act in conformity with his theories which led people to say that he was treading in evil ways. Certainly from the moral standpoint Rachel was not altogether satisfactory. But it is by no means certain whether, if she had been some person no more worthy but a duchess or the heiress to many millions, Mme. de Marsantes would not have been in favour of the match\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well, to return to Mme. des Laumes (shortly afterwards Duchesse de Guermantes, on the death of her father-in-law), it was the last agonising straw upon the backs of the Courvoisiers that the theories of the young Princess, remaining thus lodged in her speech, should not in any sense be guiding her conduct; with the result that this philosophy (if one may so call it) in no way impaired the aristocratic smartness of the Guermantes drawing-room. No doubt all the people whom Mme. de Guermantes did not invite imagined that it was because they were not clever enough, and some rich American lady who had never had any book in her possession except a little old copy, never opened, of Parny\u2019s poems, arranged because it was of the \u2018period\u2019 upon one of the tables in her inner room, shewed how much importance she attached to the things of the mind by the devouring gaze which she fastened on the Duchesse de Guermantes when that lady made her appearance at the Opera. No doubt, also, Mme. de Guermantes was sincere when she selected a person on account of his or her intellect. When she said of a woman: \u201cIt appears, she\u2019s quite charming!\u201d or of a man that he was the \u201ccleverest person in the world,\u201d she imagined herself to have no other reason for consenting to receive them than this charm or cleverness, the familiar spirit not interposing itself at this last moment; more deeply rooted, stationed at the obscure entry of the region in which the Guermantes exercised their judgment, this vigilant spirit precluded them from finding the man clever or the woman charming if they had no social value, actual or potential. The man was pronounced learned, but like a dictionary, or, on the contrary, common, with the mind of a commercial traveller, the woman pretty, but with a terribly bad style, or too talkative. As for the people who had no definite position, they were simply dreadful \u2014 such snobs! M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, whose country house was quite close to Guermantes, mixed with no one below the rank of Highness. But he laughed at them in his heart and longed only to spend his days in museums. Accordingly Mme. de Guermantes was indignant when anyone spoke of M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 as a snob. \u201cA snob! Babal! But, my poor friend, you must be mad, it\u2019s just the opposite. He loathes smart people; he won\u2019t let himself be introduced to anyone. Even in my house! If I ask him to meet some one he doesn\u2019t know, he swears at me all the time.\u201d This was not to say that, even in practice, the Guermantes did not adopt an entirely different attitude towards cleverness from the Courvoisiers. In a positive sense, this difference between the Guermantes and the Courvoisiers had begun already to bear very promising fruit. Thus the Duchesse de Guermantes, enveloped moreover in a mystery which had set so many poets dreaming of her at a respectful distance, had given that party to which I have already referred, at which the King of England had enjoyed himself more thoroughly than anywhere else, for she had had the idea, which would never have occurred to a Courvoisier mind, of inviting, and the audacity, from which a Courvoisier courage would have recoiled, to invite, apart from the personages already mentioned, the musician Gaston Lemaire and the dramatist Grandmougin. But it was pre-eminently from the negative point of view that intellectuality made itself felt. If the necessary coefficient of cleverness and charm declined steadily as the rank of the person who sought an invitation from the Princesse des Laumes became more exalted, vanishing into zero when he or she was one of the principal Crowned Heads of Europe, conversely the farther they fell below this royal level the higher the coefficient rose. For instance at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s parties there were a number of people whom her Royal Highness invited because she had known them as children, or because they were related to some duchess, or attached to the person of some Sovereign, they themselves being quite possibly ugly, boring or stupid; well, with a Courvoisier any of the reasons: \u201ca favourite of the Princesse de Parme,\u201d \u201ca niece on the mother\u2019s side of the Duchesse d\u2019Arpajon,\u201d \u201cspends three months every year with the Queen of Spain,\u201d would have been sufficient to make her invite such people to her house, but Mme. de Guermantes, who had politely acknowledged their bows for ten years at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s, had never once allowed them to cross her threshold, considering that the same rule applied to a drawing-room in a social as in a material sense, where it only needed a few pieces of furniture which had no particular beauty but were left there to fill the room and as a sign of the owner\u2019s wealth, to render it hideous. Such a drawing-room resembled a book in which the author could not refrain from the use of language advertising his own learning, brilliance, fluency. Like a book, like a house, the quality of a \u2018salon,\u2019 thought Mme. de Guermantes \u2014 and rightly \u2014 is based on the corner-stone of sacrifice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many of the friends of the Princesse de Parme, with whom the Duchesse de Guermantes had confined herself for years past to the same conventional greeting, or to returning their cards, without ever inviting them to her parties or going to theirs, complained discreetly of these omissions to her Highness who, on days when M. de Guermantes came by himself to see her, passed on a hint to him. But the wily nobleman, a bad husband to the Duchess in so far as he kept mistresses, but her most tried and trusty friend in everything that concerned the good order of her drawing-room (and her own wit, which formed its chief attraction), replied: \u201cBut doe my wife know her? Indeed! Oh, well, I daresay she does. But the truth is, Ma\u2019am, that Oriane does not care for women\u2019s conversation. She lives surrounded by a court of superior minds \u2014 I am not her husband, I am only the first footman. Except for quite a small number, who are all of them very clever indeed, women bore her. Surely, Ma\u2019am, your Highness with all her fine judgment is not going to tell me that the Marquise de Souvr\u00e9 has any brains. Yes, I quite understand, the Princess receives her out of kindness. Besides, your Highness knows her. You tell me that Oriane has met her; it is quite possible, but once or twice at the most I assure you. And then, I must explain to your Highness, it is really a little my fault as well. My wife is very easily tired, and she is so anxious to be friendly always that if I allowed her she would never stop going to see people. Only yesterday evening she had a temperature, she was afraid of hurting the Duchesse de Bourbon\u2019s feelings by not going to see her. I had to shew my teeth, I assure you; I positively forbade them to bring the carriage round. Do you know, Ma\u2019am, I should really prefer not to mention to Oriane that you have spoken to me about Mme. de Souvr\u00e9. My wife is so devoted to your Highness, she will go round at once to invite Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 to the house; that will mean another call to be paid, it will oblige us to make friends with the sister, whose husband I know quite well. I think I shall say nothing at all about it to Oriane, if the Princess has no objection. That will save her a great deal of strain and excitement. And I assure you that it will be no loss to Mme. de Souvr\u00e9. She goes everywhere, moves in the most brilliant circles. You know, we don\u2019t entertain at all, really, just a few little friendly dinners, Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 would be bored to death.\u201d The Princesse de Parme, innocently convinced that the Duc de Guermantes would not transmit her request to his Duchess, and dismayed by her failure to procure the invitation that Mme. de Souvr\u00e9 sought, was all the more flattered to think that she herself was one of the regular frequenters of so exclusive a household. No doubt this satisfaction had its drawbacks also. Thus whenever the Princesse de Parme invited Mme. de Guermantes to her own parties she had to rack her brains to be sure that there was no one else on her list whose presence might offend the Duchess and make her refuse to come again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On ordinary evenings (after dinner, at which she invariably entertained at a very early hour, for she clung to old customs, a small party) the drawing-room of the Princesse de Parme was thrown open to her regular guests, and, generally speaking, to all the higher ranks of the aristocracy, French and foreign. The order of her receptions was as follows: on issuing from the dining-room the Princess sat down on a sofa before a large round table and chatted with the two most important of the ladies who had dined with her, or else cast her eyes over a magazine, or sometimes played cards (or pretended to play, adopting a German court custom), either a game of patience by herself or selecting as her real or pretended partner some prominent personage. By nine o\u2019clock the double doors of the big drawing-room were in a state of perpetual agitation, opening and shutting and opening again to admit the visitors who had dined quietly at home (or if they had dined in town hurried from their caf\u00e9 promising to return later, since they intended only to go in at one door and out at the other) in order to conform with the Princess\u2019s time-table. She, meanwhile, her mind fixed on her game or conversation, made a show of not seeing the new arrivals, and it was not until they were actually within reach of her that she rose graciously from her seat, with a friendly smile for the women. The latter thereupon sank before the upright Presence in a courtesy which was tantamount to a genuflexion, so as to bring their lips down to the level of the beautiful hand which hung very low, and to kiss it. But at that moment the Princess, just as if she had been every time surprised by a formality with which nevertheless she was perfectly familiar, raised the kneeling figure as though by main force, and with incomparable grace and sweetness, and kissed her on both cheeks. A grace and sweetness that were conditional, you may say, upon the meekness with which the arriving guest inclined her knee. Very likely; and it seems that in a society without distinctions of rank politeness would vanish, not, as is generally supposed, from want of breeding, but because from one class would have vanished the deference due to a distinction which must be imaginary to be effective, and, more completely still, from the other class the affability in the distribution of which one is prodigal so long as one knows it to be, to the recipient, of an untold value which, in a world based on equality, would at once fall to nothing like everything that has only a promissory worth. But this disappearance of politeness in a reconstructed society is by no means certain, and we are at times too ready to believe that the present is the only possible state of things. People of first-rate intelligence have held the opinion that a Republic could not have any diplomacy or foreign alliances, and, more recently, that the peasant class would not tolerate the separation of Church and State. After all, the survival of politeness in a society levelled to uniformity would be no more miraculous than the practical success of the railway or the use of the aeroplane in war. Besides, even if politeness were to vanish, there is nothing to shew that this would be a misfortune. Lastly, would not society become secretly more hierarchical as it became outwardly more democratic? This seems highly probable. The political power of the Popes has grown enormously since they ceased to possess either States or an Army; our cathedrals meant far less to a devout Catholic of the seventeenth century than they mean to an atheist of the twentieth, and if the Princesse de Parme had been the sovereign ruler of a State, no doubt I should have felt myself impelled to speak of her almost as I should speak of a President of the Republic, that is to say not at all\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as the postulant had been raised from the ground and embraced by the Princess, the latter resumed her seat and returned to her game of patience, but first of all, if the newcomer were of any importance, held her for a moment in conversation, making her sit down in an armchair\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the room became too crowded the lady in waiting who had to control the traffic cleared the floor by leading the regular guests into an immense hall on to which the drawing-room opened, a hall filled with portraits and minor trophies of the House of Bourbon. The intimate friends of the Princess would then volunteer for the part of guide and would repeat interesting anecdotes, to which the young people had not the patience to listen, more interested in the spectacle of living Royalties (with the possibility of having themselves presented to them by the lady in waiting and the maids of honour) than in examining the relics of dead Sovereigns. Too much occupied with the acquaintances which they would be able to form and the invitations it might perhaps be possible to secure, they knew absolutely nothing, even in after-years, of what there was in this priceless museum of the archives of the Monarchy, and could only recall confusedly that it was decorated with cacti and giant palms which gave this centre of social elegance a look of the palmarium in the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Naturally the Duchesse de Guermantes, by way of self-mortification, did occasionally appear on these evenings to pay an \u2018after dinner\u2019 call on the Princess, who kept her all the time by her side, while she rallied the Duke. But on evenings when the Duchess came to dine, the Princess took care not to invite her regular party, and closed her doors to the world on rising from table, for fear lest a too liberal selection of guests might offend the exacting Duchess. On such evenings, were any of the faithful who had not received warning to present themselves on the royal doorstep, they would be informed by the porter: \u201cHer Royal Highness is not at home this evening,\u201d and would turn away. But, long before this, many of the Princess\u2019s friends had known that, on the day in question, they would not be asked to her house. These were a special set of parties, a privilege barred to so many who must have longed for admission. The excluded could, with a practical certainty, enumerate the roll of the elect, and would say irritably among themselves: \u201cYou know, of course, that Oriane de Guermantes never goes anywhere without her entire staff.\u201d With the help of this body the Princesse de Parme sought to surround the Duchess as with a protecting rampart against those persons the chance of whose making a good impression on her was at all doubtful. But with several of the Duchess\u2019s favourites, with several members of this glittering \u2018staff,\u2019 the Princesse de Parme resented having to go out of her way to shew them attentions, seeing that they paid little or no attention to herself. No doubt the Princess was fully prepared to admit that it was possible to derive more enjoyment in the company of the Duchesse de Guermantes than in her own. She could not deny that there was always a \u2018crush\u2019 on the Duchess\u2019s at-home days, or that she herself often met there three or four royal personages who thought it sufficient to leave their cards upon her. And in vain might she commit to memory Oriane\u2019s witty sayings, copy her gowns, serve at her own tea parties the same strawberry tarts, there were occasions on which she was left by herself all afternoon with a lady in waiting and some foreign Counsellor of Legation. And so whenever (as had been the case with Swann, for instance, at an earlier period) there was anyone who never let a day pass without going to spend an hour or two at the Duchess\u2019s and paid a call once in two years on the Princesse de Parme, the latter felt no great desire, even for the sake of amusing Oriane, to make to this Swann or whoever he was the \u2018advances\u2019 of an invitation to dinner. In a word, having the Duchess in her house was for the Princess a source of endless perplexity, so haunted was she by the fear that Oriane would find fault with everything. But in return, and for the same reason, when the Princesse de Parme came to dine with Mme. de Guermantes she could be certain beforehand that everything would be perfect, delightful, she had only one fear which was that of her own inability to understand, remember, give satisfaction, her inability to assimilate new ideas and people. On this account my presence aroused her attention and excited her cupidity, just as might a new way of decorating the dinner-table with festoons of fruit, uncertain as she was which of the two it might be \u2014 the table decorations or my presence \u2014 that was the more distinctively one of those charms, the secret of the success of Oriane\u2019s parties, and in her uncertainty firmly resolved to try at her own next dinner-party to introduce them both. What for that matter fully justified the enraptured curiosity which the Princesse de Parme brought to the Duchess\u2019s house was that element \u2014 amusing, dangerous, exciting \u2014 into which the Princess used to plunge with a combination of anxiety, shock and delight (as at the seaside on one of those days of \u2018big waves\u2019 of the danger of which the bathing-masters warn us, simply and solely because none of them knows how to swim), from which she used to emerge terrified, happy, rejuvenated, and which was known as the wit of the Guermantes. The wit of the Guermantes \u2014 a thing as non-existent as the squared circle, according to the Duchess who regarded herself as the sole Guermantes to possess it \u2014 was a family reputation like that of the pork pies of Tours or the biscuits of Rheims. No doubt (since an intellectual peculiarity does not employ for its perpetuation the same channels as a shade of hair or complexion) certain intimate friends of the Duchess who were not of her blood were nevertheless endowed with this wit, which on the other hand had failed to permeate the minds of various Guermantes, too refractory to assimilate wit of any kind. The holders, not related to the Duchess, of this Guermantes wit had generally the characteristic feature of having been brilliant men, fitted for a career to which, whether it were in the arts, diplomacy, parliamentary eloquence or the army, they had preferred the life of a small and intimate group. Possibly this preference could be explained by a certain want of originality, of initiative, of will power, of health or of luck, or possibly by snobbishness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With certain people (though these, it must be admitted, were the exception) if the Guermantes drawing-room had been the stumbling-block in their careers, it had been without their knowledge. Thus a doctor, a painter and a diplomat of great promise had failed to achieve success in the careers for which they were nevertheless more brilliantly endowed than most of their competitors because their friendship with the Guermantes had the result that the two former were regarded as men of fashion and the third as a reactionary, which had prevented each of the three from winning the recognition of his colleagues. The mediaeval gown and red cap which are still donned by the electoral colleges of the Faculties are (or were at least, not so long since) something more than a purely outward survival from a narrow-minded past, from a rigid sectarianism. Under the cap with its golden tassels, like the High Priest in the conical mitre of the Jews, the \u2018Professors\u2019 were still, in the years that preceded the Dreyfus case, fast rooted in rigorously pharisaical ideas. Du Boulbon was at heart an artist, but was safe because he did not care for society. Cottard was always at the Verdurins\u2019. But Mme. Verdurin was a patient; besides, he was protected by his vulgarity; finally, at his own house he entertained no one outside the Faculty, at banquets over which there floated an aroma of carbolic. But in powerful corporations, where moreover the rigidity of their prejudices is but the price that must be paid for the noblest integrity, the most lofty conceptions of morality, which weaken in an atmosphere that, more tolerant, freer at first, becomes very soon dissolute, a Professor in his gown of scarlet satin faced with ermine, like that of a Doge (which is to say a Duke) of Venice enshrined in the Ducal Palace, was as virtuous, as deeply attached to noble principles, but as unsparing of any alien element as that other Duke, excellent but terrible, whom we know as M. de Saint-Simon. The alien, here, was the wordly doctor, with other manners, other social relations. To make good, the unfortunate of whom we are now speaking, so as not to be accused by his colleagues of looking down on them (the strange ideas of a man of fashion!) if he concealed from them his Duchesse de Guermantes, hoped to disarm them by giving mixed dinner-parties in which the medical element was merged in the fashionable. He was unaware that in so doing he signed his own death-warrant, or rather he discovered this later, when the Council of Ten had to fill a vacant chair, and it was invariably the name of another doctor, more normal, it might be obviously inferior, that leaped from the fatal urn, when their \u2018Veto\u2019 thundered from the ancient Faculty, as solemn, as absurd and as terrible as the \u2018Juro\u2019 that spelled the death of Moli\u00e8re. So too with the painter permanently labelled man of fashion, when fashionable people who dabbled in art had succeeded in making themselves be labelled artists; so with the diplomat who had too many reactionary associations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this case was the rarest of all. The type of distinguished man who formed the main substance of the Guermantes drawing-room was that of people who had voluntarily (or so at least they supposed) renounced all else, everything that was incompatible with the wit of the Guermantes, with the courtesy of the Guermantes, with that indefinable charm odious to any \u2018Corporation\u2019 however little centralised\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the people who were aware that in days gone by one of these frequenters of the Duchess\u2019s drawing-room had been awarded the gold medal of the Salon, that another, Secretary to the Bar Council, had made a brilliant start in the Chamber, that a third had ably served France as Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires, might have been led to regard as \u2018failures\u2019 people who had done nothing more now for twenty years. But there were few who were thus \u2018well-informed,\u2019 and the parties concerned would themselves have been the last to remind people, finding these old distinctions to be now valueless, in the light of this very Guermantes spirit of wit: for did not this condemn respectively as a bore or an usher, and as a counter-jumper a pair of eminent Ministers, one a trifle solemn, the other addicted to puns, of whose praises the newspapers were always full but in whose company Mme. de Guermantes would begin to yawn and shew signs of impatience if the imprudence of a hostess had placed either of them next to her at the dinner-table. Since being a statesman of the first rank was in no sense a recommendation to the Duchess\u2019s favour, those of her friends who had definitely abandoned the \u2018Career\u2019 or the \u2018Service,\u2019 who had never stood for the Chamber, felt, as they came day after day to have luncheon and talk with their great friend, or when they met her in the houses of Royal Personages, of whom for that matter they thought very little (or at least they said so), that they themselves had chosen the better part, albeit their melancholy air, even in the midst of the gaiety, seemed somehow to challenge the soundness of this opinion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be recognised also that the refinement of social life, the subtlety of conversation at the Guermantes\u2019 did also contain, exiguous as it may have been, an element of reality. No official title was equivalent to the approval of certain chosen friends of Mme. de Guermantes, whom the most powerful Ministers had been unable to attract to their houses. If in this drawing-room so many intellectual ambitions, such noble efforts even had been for ever buried, still at least from their dust the rarest blossoms of civilised society had taken life. Certainly men of wit, Swann for instance, regarded themselves as superior to men of genuine worth, whom they despised, but that was because what the Duchesse de Guermantes valued above everything else was not intellect; it was, according to her, that superior, more exquisite form of the human intellect exalted to a verbal variety of talent \u2014 wit. And long ago at the Verdurins\u2019 when Swann condemned Brichot and Elstir, one as a pedant and the other as a clown, despite all the learning of one and the other\u2019s genius, it was the infiltration of the Guermantes spirit that had led him to classify them so. Never would he have dared to present either of them to the Duchess, conscious instinctively of the air with which she would have listened to Brichot\u2019s monologues and Elstir\u2019s hair-splittings, the Guermantes spirit regarding pretentious and prolix speech, whether in a serious or a farcical vein, as alike of the most intolerable imbecility\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the Guermantes of the true flesh and blood, if the Guermantes spirit had not absorbed them as completely as we see occur in, to take an example, those literary circles in which everyone shares a common way of pronouncing his words, of expressing his thoughts, and consequently of thinking, it was certainly not because originality is stronger in purely social groups or presents any obstacle there to imitation. But imitation depends not merely upon the absence of any unconquerable originality but also demands a relative fineness of ear which enables one first of all to discern what one is afterwards to imitate. Whereas there were several Guermantes in whom this musical sense was as entirely lacking as in the Courvoisiers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To take as an instance what is called, in another sense of the word imitation, \u2018giving imitations\u2019 (or among the Guermantes was called \u2018taking off\u2019), Mme. de Guermantes might succeed in this to perfection, the Courvoisiers were as incapable of appreciating her as if they had been a tribe of rabbits instead of men and women, because they had never had the sense to observe the particular defect or accent that the Duchess was endeavouring to copy. When she \u2018gave an imitation\u2019 of the Duc de Limoges, the Courvoisiers would protest: \u201cOh, no, he doesn\u2019t really speak like that! I met him again only yesterday at dinner at Bebeth\u2019s; he talked to me all evening and he didn\u2019t speak like that at all!\u201d whereas the Guermantes of any degree of culture exclaimed: \u201cGad, what fun Oriane is! The odd part of it is that when she is copying him she looks exactly like him! I feel I\u2019m listening to him. Oriane, do give us a little more Limoges!\u201d Now these Guermantes (and not necessarily the few really outstanding members of the clan who when the Duchess imitated the Duc de Limoges, would say admiringly\u2019 \u201cOh, you really have got him,\u201d or \u201cYou do get him,\u201d) might indeed be del void of wit according to Mme. de Guermantes (and in this respect she was right); yet, by dint of hearing and repeating her sayings they had come to imitate more or less her way of expressing herself, of criticising people of what Swann, like the Duke himself, used to call her \u2018phrasing\u2019 of things so that they presented in their conversation something which to the Courvoisiers appeared \u2018fearfully like\u2019 Oriane\u2019s wit and was treated by them collectively as the \u2018wit of the Guermantes.\u2019 As these Guermantes were to her not merely kinsfolk but admirers, Oriane (who kept the rest of the family rigorously at arm\u2019s-length and now avenged by her disdain the insults that they had heaped upon her in her girlhood) went to call on them now and then, generally in company with the Duke, in the season, when she drove out with him. These visits were historic events. The heart began to beat more rapidly in the bosom of the Princesse d\u2019Epinay, who was \u2018at home\u2019 in her big drawing-room on the ground floor, when she perceived afar off, like the first glow of an innocuous fire, or the \u2018reconnaissances\u2019 of an unexpected invasion, making her way across the courtyard slowly, in a diagonal course, the Duchess crowned with a ravishing hat and holding atilt a sunshade from which there rained down a summer fragrance. \u201cWhy, here comes Oriane,\u201d she would say, like an \u2018On guard!\u2019 intended to convey a prudent warning to her visitors, so that they should have time to beat an orderly retreat, to clear the rooms without panic. Half of those present dared not remain, and rose at once to go. \u201cBut no, why? Sit down again, I insist on keeping you a little longer,\u201d said the Princess in a careless tone and seemingly at her ease (to shew herself the great lady) but in a voice that suddenly rang false. \u201cBut you may want to talk to each other.\u201d \u201cReally, you\u2019re in a hurry? Oh, very well, I shall come and see you,\u201d replied the lady of the house to those whom she was just as well pleased to see depart. The Duke and Duchess gave a very civil greeting to people whom they had seen there regularly for years, without for that reason coming to know them any better, while these in return barely said good day to them, thinking this more discreet. Scarcely had they left the room before the Duke began asking good-naturedly who they were, so as to appear to be taking an interest in the intrinsic quality of people whom he himself, owing to the cross-purposes of fate or the wretched state of Oriane\u2019s nerves, never saw in his own house. \u201cTell me, who was that little woman in the pink hat?\u201d \u201cWhy, my dear cousin, you have seen her hundreds of times, she\u2019s the Vicomtesse de Tours, who was a Lamarzelle.\u201d \u201cBut, do you know, she\u2019s quite good-looking; she seems clever too; if it weren\u2019t for a little flaw in her upper lip she\u2019d be a regular charmer. If there\u2019s a Vicomte de Tours, he can\u2019t have any too bad a time. Oriane, do you know what those eyebrows and the way her hair grows reminded me of? Your cousin Hedwige de Ligne.\u201d The Duchesse de Guermantes, who languished whenever people spoke of the beauty of any woman other than herself, let the conversation drop. She bad reckoned without the weakness her husband had for letting it be seen that he knew all about the people who did not come to his house, whereby be believed that he shewed himself to be more seriously minded than his wife. \u2018\u201cBut,\u201d he resumed suddenly with emphasis, \u201cyou mentioned the name Lamarzelle. I remember, when I was in the Chamber, hearing a really remarkable speech made . . . \u201d \u201cThat was the uncle of the young woman you saw just now.\u201d \u201cIndeed! What talent! No, my dear girl,\u201d he assured the Vicomtesse d\u2019Egremont, whom Mme. de Guermantes could not endure, but who, refusing to stir from the Princesse d\u2019Epinay\u2019s drawing-room where she willingly humbled herself to play the part of parlour-maid (and was ready to slap her own parlour-maid on returning home), stayed there, confused, tearful, but stayed when the ducal couple were in the room, took their cloaks, tried to make herself useful, offered discreetly to withdraw into the next room, \u201cyou are not to make tea for us, let us just sit and talk quietly, we are simple souls, really, honestly. Besides,\u201d he went on, turning to the Princesse d\u2019Epinay (leaving the Egremont lady blushing, humble, ambitious and full of zeal), \u201cwe can only give you a quarter of an hour.\u201d This quarter of an hour was entirely taken up with a sort of exhibition of the witty things which the Duchess had said during the previous week, and to which she herself would certainly not have referred had not her husband, with great adroitness, by appearing to be rebuking her with reference to the incidents that had provoked them, obliged her as though against her will to repeat them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Princesse d\u2019Epinay, who was fond of her cousin and knew that she had a weakness for compliments, went into ecstasies over her hat, her sunshade, her wit. \u201cTalk to her as much as you like about her clothes,\u201d said the Duke in the sullen tone which he had adopted and now tempered with a sardonic smile so that his resentment should not be taken seriously, \u201cbut for heaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t speak of her wit, I should be only too glad not to have so witty a wife. You are probably alluding to the shocking pun she made about my brother Palam\u00e8de,\u201d he went on, knowing quite well that the Princess and the rest of the family had not yet heard this pun, and delighted to have an opportunity of shewing off his wife. \u201cIn the first place I consider it unworthy of a person who has occasionally, I must admit, said some quite good things, to make bad puns, but especially about my brother, who is very susceptible, and if it is going to lead to his quarrelling with me, that would really be too much of a good thing.\u201d \u201cBut we never heard a word about it! One of Oriane\u2019s puns! It\u2019s sure to be delicious. Oh, do tell us!\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d the Duke went on, still sulking though with a broader smile, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you haven\u2019t heard it. Seriously, I\u2019m very fond of my brother.\u201d \u201cListen, Basin,\u201d broke in the Duchess, the moment having come for her to take up her husband\u2019s cue, \u201cI can\u2019t think why you should say that it might annoy Palam\u00e8de, you know quite well it would do nothing of the sort. He is far too intelligent to be vexed by a stupid joke which has nothing offensive about it. You are making them think I said something nasty; I simply uttered a remark which was not in the least funny, it is you who make it seem important by losing your temper over it. I don\u2019t understand you.\u201d \u201cYou are making us terribly excited, what is it all about?\u201d \u201cOh, obviously nothing serious!\u201d cried M. de Guermantes. \u201cYou may have heard that my brother offered to give Br\u00e9z\u00e9, the place he got from his wife, to his sister Marsantes.\u201d \u201cYes, but we were told that she didn\u2019t want it, she didn\u2019t care for that part of the country, the climate didn\u2019t suit her.\u201d \u201cVery well, some one had been telling my wife all that and saying that if my brother was giving this place to our sister it was not so much to please her as to tease her. \u2018He\u2019s such a teaser, Charlus,\u2019 was what they actually said. Well, you know Br\u00e9z\u00e9, it\u2019s a royal domain, I should say it\u2019s worth millions, it used to be part of the crown lands, it includes one of the finest forests in the whole of France. There are plenty of people who would be only too delighted to be teased to that tune. And so when she heard the word \u2018teaser\u2019 applied to Charlus because he was giving away such a magnificent property, Oriane could not help exclaiming, without meaning anything, I must admit, there wasn\u2019t a trace of ill-nature about it, for it came like a flash of lightning: \u2018Teaser, teaser? Then he must be Teaser Augustus.\u2019 You understand,\u201d he went on, resuming his sulky tone, having first cast a sweeping glance round the room in order to judge the effect of his wife\u2019s witticism \u2014 and in some doubt as to the extent of Mme. d\u2019Epinay\u2019s acquaintance with ancient history, \u201cyou understand, it\u2019s an allusion to Augustus Caesar, the Roman Emperor; it\u2019s too stupid, a bad play on words, quite unworthy of Oriane. And then, you see, I am more circumspect than my wife, if I haven\u2019t her wit, I think of the consequences; if anyone should be so ill-advised as to repeat the remark to my brother there\u2019ll be the devil to pay. All the more,\u201d he went on, \u201cbecause as you know Palam\u00e8de is very high and mighty, and very fussy also, given to gossip and all that sort of thing, so that quite apart from the question of his giving away Br\u00e9z\u00e9 you must admit that \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 suits him down to the ground. That is what justifies my wife\u2019s remarks; even when she is inclined to stoop to what is almost vulgar, she is always witty and does really describe people.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, thanks on one occasion to \u2018Teaser Augustus,\u2019 on another to something else, the visits paid by the Duke and Duchess to their kinsfolk replenished the stock of anecdotes, and the emotion which these visits aroused lasted long after the departure of the sparkling lady and her \u2018producer.\u2019 Her hostess would begin by going over again with the privileged persons who had been at the entertainment (those who had remained in the room) the clever things that Oriane had said. \u201cYou hadn\u2019t heard \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019?\u201d asked the Princesse d\u2019Epinay. \u201cYes,\u201d replied the Marquise de Baveno, blushing as she spoke, \u201cthe Princesse de Sarsina (the La Rochefoucauld one) mentioned it to me, not quite in the same words. But of course it was far more interesting to hear it repeated like that with my cousin in the room,\u201d she went on, as though speaking of a song that had been accompanied by the composer himself. \u201cWe were speaking of Oriane\u2019s latest \u2014 she was here just now,\u201d her hostess greeted a visitor who would be plunged in despair at not having arrived an hour earlier. \u201cWhat! Has Oriane been here?\u201d \u201cYes, you ought to have come a little sooner,\u201d the Princesse d\u2019Epinay informed her, not in reproach but letting her understand all that her clumsiness had made her miss. It was her fault alone if she had not been present at the Creation of the World or at Mme. Carvalho\u2019s last performance. \u201cWhat do you think of Oriane\u2019s latest? I must say, I do enjoy \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019,\u201d and the \u2018saying\u2019 would be served up again cold next day at luncheon before a few intimate friends who were invited on purpose, and would reappear under various sauces throughout the week. Indeed the Princess happening in the course of that week to pay her annual visit to the Princesse de Parme seized the opportunity to ask whether her Royal Highness had heard the pun, and repeated it to her. \u201cAh! Teaser Augustus,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, her eyes bulging with an instinctive admiration, which begged however for a complementary elucidation which Mme. d\u2019Epinay was not loath to furnish. \u201cI must say, \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 pleases me enormously as a piece of \u2018phrasing\u2019,\u201d she concluded. As a matter of fact the word \u2018phrasing\u2019 was not in the least applicable to this pun, but the Princesse d\u2019Epinay, who claimed to have assimilated her share of the Guermantes spirit, had borrowed from Oriane the expressions \u2018phrased\u2019 and \u2018phrasing\u2019 and employed them without much discrimination. New the Princesse de Parme, who was not at all fond of Mme. d\u2019Epinay, whom she considered plain, knew to be miserly and believed, on the authority of the Courvoisiers, to be malicious, recognised this word \u2018phrasing\u2019 which she had heard used by Mme. de Guermantes but would not by herself have known how or when to apply. She received the impression that it was in fact its \u2018phrasing\u2019 that formed the charm of \u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 and, without altogether forgetting her antipathy towards the plain and miserly lady, could not repress a burst of admiration for a person endowed to such a degree with the Guermantes spirit, so strong that she was on the point of inviting the Princesse d\u2019Epinay to the Opera. She was held in check only by the reflexion that it would be wiser perhaps to consult Mme. de Guermantes first. As for Mme. d\u2019Epinay, who, unlike the Courvoisiers, paid endless attentions to Oriane and was genuinely fond of her but was jealous of her exalted friends and slightly irritated by the fun which the Duchess used to make of her before everyone on account of her meanness, she reported on her return home what an effort it had required to make the Princesse de Parme grasp the point of \u2018Teaser Augustus,\u2019 and declared what a snob Oriane must be to number such a goose among her friends. \u201cI should never have been able to see much of the Princesse de Parme even if I had cared to,\u201d she informed the friends who were dining with her. \u201cM. d\u2019Epinay would not have allowed it for a moment, because of her immorality,\u201d she explained, alluding to certain purely imaginary excesses on the part of the Princess. \u201cBut even if I had had a husband less strict in his views, I must say I could never have made friends with her. I don\u2019t know how Oriane can bear to see her every other day, as she does. I go there once a year, and it\u2019s all I can do to sit out my call.\u201d As for those of the Courvoisiers who happened to be at Victurnienne\u2019s on the day of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s visit, the arrival of the Duchess generally put them to flight owing to the exasperation they felt at the \u2018ridiculous salaams\u2019 that were made to her there. One alone remained on the afternoon of \u2018Teaser Augustus.\u2019 He did not entirely see the point, but he did see part of it, being an educated man. And the Courvoisiers went about repeating that Oriane had called uncle Palarned \u2018Caesar Augustus,\u2019 which was, according to them, a good enough descrin tion of him, but why all this endless talk about Oriane, they went on People couldn\u2019t make more fuss about a queen. \u201cAfter all, what is Oriane? I don\u2019t say that the Guermantes aren\u2019t an old family, but the Courvoisiers are every bit as good in rank, antiquity, marriages. We mustn\u2019t forget that on the Field of the Cloth of Gold, when the King of England asked Fran\u00e7ois I who was the noblest of the lords there present, \u2018Sire,\u2019 said the King of France, \u2018Courvoisier.\u2019\u201d But even if all the Courvoisiers had stayed in the room to hear them, Oriane\u2019s sayings would have fallen on deaf ears, since the incidents that usually gave occasion for those sayings would have been regarded by them from a totally different point of view. If, for instance, a Courvoisier found herself running short of chairs, in the middle of a party, or if she used the wrong name in greeting a guest whose face she did not remember, or if one of her servants said something stupid, the Courvoisier, extremely annoyed, flushed, quivering with excitement, would deplore so unfortunate an occurrence. And when she had a visitor in the room and Oriane was expected, she would say in a tone anxiously and imperiously questioning: \u201cDo you know her?\u201d, fearing that if the visitor did not know her his presence might make an unfortunate impression on Oriane. But Mme. de Guermantes on the contrary extracted from such incidents opportunities for stories which made the Guermantes laugh until the tears streamed down their cheeks, so that one was obliged to envy her her having run short of chairs, having herself made or having allowed her servant to make a blunder, having had at her party some one whom nobody knew, as one is obliged to be thankful that great writers have been kept at a distance by men and betrayed by women when their humiliations and their sufferings have been if not the direct stimulus of their genius, at any rate the subject matter of their works\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Courvoisiers were incapable of rising to the level of the spirit of innovation which the Duchesse de Guermantes introduced into the life of society and, by adapting it, following an unerring instinct, to the necessities of the moment, made into something artistic where the purely rational application of cut and dried rules would have given as unfortunate results as would greet a man who, anxious to succeed in love or in politics, was to reproduce in his own daily life the exploits of Bussy d\u2019Amboise. If the Courvoisiers gave a family dinner or a dinner to meet some prince, the addition of a recognised wit, of some friend of their son seemed to them an anomaly capable of producing the direst consequences. A Courvoisier whose father had been a Minister of the Empire having to give an afternoon party to meet Princesse Mathilde deduced by a geometrical formula that she could invite no one but Bonapartists. Of whom she knew practically none. All the smart women of her acquaintance, all the amusing men were ruthlessly barred because, from their Legitimist views or connexions, they might easily, according to Courvoisier logic, give offence to the Imperial Highness. The latter, who in her own house entertained the flower of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, was quite surprised when she found at Mme. de Courvoisier\u2019s only a notorious old sponger whose husband had been an Imperial Prefect, the widow of the Director of Posts and sundry others known for their loyalty to Napoleon, their stupidity and their dullness. Princesse Mathilde, however, in no way stinted the generous and refreshing shower of her sovereign grace over these miserable scarecrows whom the Duchesse de Guermantes, for her part, took good care not to invite when it was her turn to entertain the Princess, but substituted for them without any abstract reasoning about Bonapartism the most brilliant coruscation of all the beauties, all the talents, all the celebrities, who, the exercise of some subtle sixth sense made her feel, would be acceptable to the niece of the Emperor even when they belonged actually to the Royal House. There was not lacking indeed the Due d\u2019Aumale, and when on withdrawing the Princess, raising Mme. de Guermantes from the ground where she had sunk in a curtsey and was trying to kiss the august hand, embraced her on both cheeks, it was from the bottom of her heart that she was able to assure the Duchess that never had she spent a happier afternoon nor seen so delightful a party. The Princesse de Parme was Courvoisier in her incapacity for innovation in social matters, but unlike the Courvoisiers the surprise that was perpetually caused her by the Duchesse de Guermantes engendered in her not, as in them, antipathy but admiration. This astonishment was still farther enhanced by the infinitely backward state of the Princess\u2019s education. Mme. de Guermantes was herself a great deal less advanced than she supposed. But it was enough for her to have gone a little beyond Mme. de Parme to stupefy that lady, and, as the critics of each generation confine themselves to maintaining the direct opposite of the truths admitted by their predecessors, she had only to say that Flaubert, that archenemy of the bourgeois, had been bourgeois through and through, or that there was a great deal of Italian music in Wagner, to open before the Princess, at the cost of a nervous exhaustion which recurred every time, as before the eyes of a swimmer in a stormy sea, horizons that seemed to her unimaginable and remained for ever vague. A stupefaction caused also by the paradoxes uttered with relation not only to works of art but to persons of their acquaintance and to current social events. No doubt the incapacity that prevented Mme. de Parme from distinguishing the true wit of the Guermantes from certain rudimentarily acquired forms of that wit (which made her believe in the high intellectual worth of certain, especially certain female Guermantes, of whom she was bewildered on hearing the Duchess confide to her with a smile that they were mere blockheads) was one of the causes of the astonishment which the Princess always felt on hearing Mme. de Guermantes criticise other people. But there was another cause also, one which I, who knew at this time more books than people and literature better than life, explained to myself by thinking that the Duchess, living this wordly life the idleness and sterility of which are to a true social activity what criticism, in art, is to creation, extended to the persons who surrounded her the instability of point of view, the uneasy thirst of the reasoner who to assuage a mind that has grown too dry goes in search of no matter what paradox that is still fairly new, and will make no bones about upholding the refreshing opinion that the really great Iphig\u00e9nie is Piccini\u2019s and not Gluck\u2019s, at a pinch the true Ph\u00e8dre that of Pradon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a woman who was intelligent, educated, witty had married a shy bumpkin whom one saw but seldom and never heard, Mme. de Guermantes one fine day would find a rare intellectual pleasure not only in decrying the wife but in \u2018discovering\u2019 the husband. In the Cambremer household for example, if she had lived in that section of society at the time, she would have decreed that Mme. de Cambremer was stupid, and that the really interesting person, misunderstood, delightful, condemned to silence by a chattering wife but himself worth a thousand of her, was the Marquis, and the Duchess would have felt on declaring this the same kind of refreshment as the critic who, after people have for seventy years been admiring Hernani, confesses to a preference for Le Lion Amoureux. And from this same morbid need of arbitrary novelties, if from her girlhood everyone had been pitying a model wife, a true saint, for being married to a scoundrel, one fine day Mme. de Guermantes would assert that this scoundrel was perhaps a frivolous man but one with a heart of gold, whom the implacable harshness of his wife had driven to do the most inconsistent things. I knew that it is not only over different works, in the long course of centuries, but over different parts of the same work that criticism plays, thrusting back into the shadow what for too long has been thought brilliant, and making emerge what has appeared to be doomed to permanent obscurity. I had not only seen Bellini, Winterhalter, the Jesuit architects, a Restoration cabinetmaker come to take the place of men of genius who were called \u2018worn out,\u2019 simply because they had worn out the lazy minds of the intellectuals, as neurasthenics are always worn out and always changing; I had seen preferred in Sainte-Beuve alternately the critic and the poet, Musset rejected so far as his poetry went save for a few quite unimportant little pieces. No doubt certain essayists are mistaken when they set above the most famous scenes in Le Cid or Polyeucte some speech from Le Menteur which, like an old plan, furnishes information about the Paris of the day, but their predilection, justified if not by considerations of beauty at least by a documentary interest, is still too rational for our criticism run mad. It will barter the whole of Moli\u00e8re for a line fromL\u2019Etourdi, and even when it pronounces Wagner\u2019s Tristan a bore will except a \u2018charming note on the horns\u2019 at the point where the hunt goes by. This depravation of taste helped me to understand that of which Mme. de Guermantes gave proof when she decided that a man of their world, recognised as a good fellow but a fool, was a monster of egoism, sharper than people thought \u2014 that another widely known for his generosity might be the personification of avarice, that a good mother paid no attention to her children, and that a woman generally supposed to be vicious was really actuated by the noblest feelings. As though spoiled by the nullity of life in society, the intelligence and perception of Mme. de Guermantes were too vacillating for disgust not to follow pretty swiftly in the wake of infatuation (leaving her still ready to feel herself attracted afresh by the kind of cleverness which she had in turn sought out and abandoned) and for the charm which she had felt in some warm-hearted man not to change, if he came too often to see her, sought too freely from her directions which she was incapable of giving him, into an irritation which she believed to be produced by her admirer but which was in fact due to the utter impossibility of finding pleasure when one does nothing else than seek it. The variations of the Duchess\u2019s judgment spared no one, except her husband. He alone had never been in love with her, in him she had always felt an iron character, indifferent to the caprices that she displayed, contemptuous of her beauty, violent, of a will that would never bend, the sort under which alone nervous people can find tranquillity. M. de Guermantes on the other hand, pursuing a single type of feminine beauty but seeking it in mistresses whom he constantly replaced, had, once he had left them, and to express derision of them, only an associate, permanent and identical, who irritated him often by her chatter but as to whom he knew that everyone regarded her as the most beautiful, the most virtuous, the cleverest, the best-read member of the aristocracy, as a wife whom he, M. de Guermantes, was only too fortunate to have found, who cloaked all his irregularities, entertained like no one else in the world, and upheld for their drawing-room its position as the premier in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. This common opinion he himself shared; often moved to ill-humour against her, he was proud of her. If, being as niggardly as he was fastidious, he refused her the most trifling sums for her charities or for the servants, yet he insisted upon her wearing the most sumptuous clothes and driving behind the best horses in Paris. Whenever Mme. de Guermantes had just perpetrated, with reference to the merits and defects, which she suddenly transposed, of one of their friends, a new and succulent paradox, she burned to make trial of it before people capable of relishing it, to bring out its psychological originality and to set its epigrammatic brilliance sparkling. No doubt these new opinions embodied as a rule no more truth than the old, often less; but this very element, arbitrary and incalculable, of novelty which they contained conferred on them something intellectual which made the communication of them exciting. Only the patient on whom the Duchess was exercising her psychological skill was generally an intimate friend as to whom those people to whom she longed to hand on her discovery were entirely unaware that he was not still at the apex of her favour; thus the reputation that Mme. de Guermantes had of being an incomparable friend, sentimental, tender and devoted, made it difficult for her to launch the attack herself; she could at the most intervene later on, as though under constraint, by uttering a response to appease, to contradict in appearance but actually to support a partner who had taken it on himself to provoke her; this was precisely the part in which M. de Guermantes excelled\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for social activities, it was yet another form of pleasure, arbitrary and spectacular, that Mme. de Guermantes felt in uttering, with regard to them, those unexpected judgments which pricked with an incessant and exquisite feeling of surprise the Princesse de Parme. But with this one of the Duchess\u2019s pleasures it was not so much with the help of literary criticism as by following political life and the reports of parliamentary debates that I tried to understand in what it might consist. The successive and contradictory edicts by which Mme. de Guermantes continually reversed the scale of values among the people of her world no longer sufficing to distract her, she sought also in the manner in which she ordered her own social behaviour, in which she recorded her own most trivial decisions on points of fashion, to taste those artificial emotions, to fulfil those adventitious obligations which stimulate the perceptions of Parliaments and gain hold of the minds of politicians. We know that when a Minister explains to the Chamber that he believed himself to be acting rightly in following a line of conduct which does, as a matter of fact, appear quite straightforward to the commonsense person who next morning in his newspaper reads the report of the sitting, this commonsense reader does nevertheless feel himself suddenly stirred and begins to doubt whether he has been right in approving the Minister\u2019s conduct when he sees that the latter\u2019s speech was listened to with the accompaniment of a lively agitation and punctuated with expressions of condemnation such as: \u201cIt\u2019s most serious!\u201d ejaculated by a Deputy whose name and titles are so long, and followed in the report by movements so emphatic that in the whole interruption the words \u201cIt\u2019s most serious!\u201d occupy less room than a hemistich does in an alexandrine. For instance in the days when M. de Guermantes, Prince des Laumes, sat in the Chamber, one used to read now and then in the Paris newspapers, albeit it was intended primarily for the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise division, to shew the electors there that they had not given their votes to an inactive or voiceless mandatory:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Monsieur de Guermantes-Bouillon, Prince des Laumes: \u201cThis is serious!\u201d \u201cHear, hear!\u201d from the Centre and some of the Right benches, loud exclamations from the Extreme Left.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The commonsense reader still retains a gleam of faith in the sage Minister, but his heart is convulsed with a fresh palpitation by the first words of the speaker who rises to reply:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe astonishment, it is not too much to say the stupor\u201d (keen sensation on the Right side of the House) \u201cthat I have felt at the words of one who is still, I presume, a member of the Government\u201d (thunder of applause) . . . Several Under-Secretaries of State for Posts and Telegraphs without Deputies then crowded round the Ministerial bench. Then rising from his seat, nodded his head in the affirmative\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This \u2018thunder of applause\u2019 carries away the last shred of resistance in the mind of the commonsense reader; he discovers to be an insult to the Chamber, monstrous in fact, a course of procedure which in itself is of no importance; it may be some normal action such as arranging that the rich shall pay more than the poor, bringing to light some piece of injustice, preferring peace to war; he will find it scandalous and will see in it an offence to certain principles to which as a matter of fact he had never given a thought, which are not engraved on the human heart, but which move him forcibly by reason of the acclamations which they provoke and the compact majorities which they assemble\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must at the same time be recognised that this subtlety of the politician which served to explain to me the Guermantes circle, and other groups in society later on, is nothing more than the perversion of a certain fineness of interpretation often described as \u2018reading between the lines.\u2019 If in representative assemblies there is absurdity owing to perversion of this quality, there is equally stupidity, through the want of it, in the public who take everything \u2018literally,\u2019 who do not suspect a dismissal when a high dignitary is relieved of his office \u2018at his own request,\u2019 and say: \u201cHe cannot have been dismissed, since it was he who asked leave to retire,\u201d\u2014 a defeat when the Russians by a strategic movement withdraw upon a stronger position that has been prepared beforehand, a refusal when, a Province having demanded its independence from the German Emperor, he grants it religious autonomy. It is possible, moreover (to return to these sittings of the Chamber), that when they open the Deputies themselves are like the commonsense person who will read the published report. Learning that certain workers on strike have sent their delegates to confer with a Minister, they may ask one another innocently: \u201cThere now, I wonder what they can have been saying; let\u2019s hope it\u2019s all settled,\u201d at the moment when the Minister himself mounts the tribune in a solemn silence which has already brought artificial emotions into play. The first words of the Minister: \u201cThere is no necessity for me to inform the Chamber that I have too high a sense of what is the duty of the Government to have received a deputation of which the authority entrusted to me could take no cognisance,\u201d produce a dramatic effect, for this was the one hypothesis which the commonsense of the Deputies had not imagined. But precisely because of its dramatic effect it is greeted with such applause that it is only after several minutes have passed that the Minister can succeed in making himself heard, the Minister who will receive on returning to his place on the bench the congratulations of his colleagues. We are as deeply moved as on the day when the same Minister failed to invite to a big official reception the President of the Municipal Council who was supporting the Opposition, and declare that on this occasion as on the other he has acted with true statesmanship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes at this period in his life had, to the great scandal of the Courvoisiers, frequently been among the crowd of Deputies who came forward to congratulate the Minister. I have heard it said afterwards that even at a time when he was playing a fairly important part in the Chamber and was being thought of in connexion with Ministerial office or an Embassy he was, when a friend came to ask a favour of him, infinitely more simple, behaved politically a great deal less like the important political personage than anyone else who did not happen to be Duc de Guermantes. For if he said that nobility made no difference, that he regarded his fellow Deputies as equals, he did not believe it for a moment. He sought, pretended to value but really despised political importance, and as he remained in his own eyes M. de Guermantes it did not envelop his person in that dead weight of high office which makes other politicians unapproachable. And in this way his pride guarded against every assault not only his manners which were of an ostentatious familiarity but also such true simplicity as he might actually have\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to those artificial and moving decisions such as are made by politicians, Mme. de Guermantes was no less disconcerting to the Guermantes, the Courvoisiers, the Faubourg in general and, more than anyone, the Princesse de Parme by her habit of issuing unaccountable decrees behind which one could feel to be latent principles which impressed one all the more, the less one expected them. If the new Greek Minister have a fancy dress ball, everyone chose a costume and asked everyone else what the Duchess would wear. One thought that she would appear as the Duchesse de Bourgogne, another suggested as probable the guise of Princess of Dujabar, a third Psyche. Finally, a Courvoisier having asked her: \u201cWhat are you going to wear, Oriane?\u201d provoked the one response of which nobody had thought: \u201cWhy, nothing at all!\u201d which at once set every tongue wagging, as revealing Oriane\u2019s opinion as to the true social position of the new Greek Minister and the proper attitude to adopt towards him, that is to say the opinion which ought to have been foreseen namely that a duchess \u2018was not expected\u2019 to attend the fancy dress bali given by this new Minister: \u201cI do not see that there is any necessity to go to the Greek Minister\u2019s; I do not know him; I am not a Greek; why should I go to these people\u2019s house, I have nothing to do with them?\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cBut everybody will be there, they say it\u2019s going to be charming!\u201d cried Mme. de Gallardon. \u201cStill, it\u2019s just as charming sometimes to sit by one\u2019s own fireside,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes. The Courvoisiers could not get over this, but the Guermantes, without copying it, approved of their cousin\u2019s attitude. \u201cNaturally, everybody isn\u2019t in a position like Oriane to break with all the conventions. But if you look at it in one way you can\u2019t say she was actually wrong in wishing to shew that we are going rather far in flinging ourselves at the feet of all these foreigners who appear from heaven knows where.\u201d Naturally, knowing the stream of comment which one or other attitude would not fail to provoke, Mme. de Guermantes took as much pleasure in appearing at a party to which her hostess had not dared to count on her coming as in staying at home or spending the evening at the play with her husband on the night of a party to which \u2018everybody was going,\u2019 or, again, when people imagined that she would eclipse the finest diamonds with some historic diadem, by stealing into the room without a single jewel, and in another style of dress than what had been, wrongly, supposed to be essential to the occasion. Albeit she was anti-Dreyfusard (while retaining her belief in the innocence of Dreyfus, just as she spent her life in the social world believing only in abstract ideas) she had created an enormous sensation at a party at the Princesse de Ligne\u2019s, first of all by remaining seated after all the ladies had risen to their feet as General Mercier entered the room, and then by getting up and in a loud voice asking for her carriage when a Nationalist orator had begun to address the gathering, thereby shewing that she did not consider that society was meant for talking politics; all heads were turned towards her at a Good Friday concert at which, although a Voltairean, she had not remained because she thought it indecent to bring Christ upon the stage. We know how important, even for the great queens of society, is that moment of the year at which the round of entertainment begins: so much so that the Marquise d\u2019Amoncourt, who, from a need to say something, a form of mania, and also from want of perception, was always making a fool of herself, had actually replied to somebody who had called to condole with her on the death of her father, M. de Montmorency: \u201cWhat makes it sadder still is that it should come at a time when one\u2019s mirror is simply stuffed with cards!\u201d Very well, at this point in the social year, when people invited the Duchesse de Guermantes to dinner, making every effort to see that she was not already engaged, she declined, for the one reason of which nobody in society would ever have thought; she was just starting on a cruise among the Norwegian fjords, which were so interesting. People in society were stupefied, and, without any thought of following the Duchess\u2019s example, derived nervertheless from her action that sense of relief which one has in reading Kant when after the most rigorous demonstration of determinism one finds that above the world of necessity there is the world of freedom. Every invention of which no one has ever thought before excites the interest even of people who can derive no benefit from it. That of steam navigation was a small thing compared with the employment of steam navigation at that sedentary time of year called \u2018the season.\u2019 The idea that anyone could voluntarily renounce a hundred dinners or luncheons, twice as many afternoon teas, three times as many evening parties, the most brilliant Mondays at the Opera and Tuesdays at the Fran\u00e7ais to visit the Norwegian fjords seemed to the Courvoisiers no more explicable than the idea of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, but conveyed to them a similar impression of independence and charm. So that not a day passed on which somebody might not be heard to ask, not merely: \u201cYou\u2019ve heard Oriane\u2019s latest joke?\u201d but \u201cYou know Oriane\u2019s latest?\u201d and on \u2018Oriane\u2019s latest\u2019 as on \u2018Oriane\u2019s latest joke\u2019 would follow the comment: \u201cHow typical of Oriane!\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t that pure Oriane?\u201d Oriane\u2019s latest might be, for instance, that, having to write on behalf of a patriotic society to Cardinal X \u2014 Bishop of Macon (whom M. de Guermantes when he spoke of him invariably called \u2018Monsieur de Mascon,\u2019 thinking this to be \u2018old French\u2019), when everyone was trying to imagine what form the letter would take, and had no difficulty as to the opening words, the choice lying between \u2018Eminence,\u2019 and \u2018Monseigneur,\u2019 but was puzzled as to the rest, Oriane\u2019s letter, to the general astonishment, began: \u2018Monsieur le Cardinal,\u2019 following an old academic form, or: \u2018My Cousin,\u2019 this term being in use among the Princes of the Church, the Gsermantes and Crowned Heads, who prayed to God to take each and all of them into \u2018His fit and holy keeping.\u2019 To start people on the topic of an \u2018Oriane\u2019s latest\u2019 it was sufficient that at a performance at which all Paris was present and a most charming play was being given, when they looked for Mme. de Guermantes in the boxes of the Princesse de Parme, the Princesse de Guermantes, countless other ladies who had invited her, they discovered her sitting by herself, in black, with a tiny hat on her head, in a stall in which she had arrived before the curtain rose. \u201cYou hear better, when it\u2019s a play that\u2019s worth listening to,\u201d she explained, to the scandal of the Courvoisiers and the admiring bewilderment of the Guermantes and the Princesse de Parme, who suddenly discovered that the \u2018fashion\u2019 of hearing the beginning of a play was more up to date, was a proof of greater originality and intelligence (which need not astonish them, coming from Oriane) than that of arriving for the last act after a big dinner-party and \u2018going on\u2019 somewhere first. Such were the various kinds of surprise for which the Princesse de Parme knew that she ought to be prepared if she put a literary or social question to Mme. de Guermantes, one result of which was that during these dinner-parties at Oriane\u2019s her Royal Highness never ventured upon the slightest topic save with the uneasy and enraptured prudence of the bather emerging from between two breakers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among the elements which, absent from the three or four other more or less equivalent drawing-rooms that set the fashion for the Faubourg Saint-Germain, differentiated from them that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, just as Leibniz allows that each monad, while reflecting the entire universe, adds to it something of its own, one of the least attractive was regularly furnished by one or two extremely good-looking women who had no title to be there apart from their beauty and the use that M. de Guermantes had made of them, and whose presence revealed at once, as does in other drawing-rooms that of certain otherwise unaccountable pictures, that in this household the husband was an ardent appreciator of feminine graces. They were all more or less alike, for the Duke had a taste for large women, at once statuesque and loose-limbed, of a type half-way between the Venus of Milo and the Samothracian Victory; often fair, rarely dark, sometimes auburn, like the most recent, who was at this dinner, that Vicomtesse d\u2019Arpajon whom he had loved so well that for a long time he had obliged her to send him as many as ten telegrams daily (which slightly annoyed the Duchess), corresponded with her by carrier pigeon when he was at Guermantes, and from whom moreover he had long been so incapable of tearing himself away that, one winter which he had had to spend at Parma, he travelled back regularly every week to Paris, spending two days in the train, in order to see her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a rule these handsome \u2018supers\u2019 had been his mistresses but were no longer (as was Mme. d\u2019Arpajon\u2019s case) or were on the point of ceasing to be so. It may well have been that the importance which the Duchess enjoyed in their sight and the hope of being invited to her house, though they themselves came of thoroughly aristocratic, but still not quite first-class stock, had prompted them, even more than the good looks and generosity of the Duke, to yield to his desires. Not that the Duchess would have placed any insuperable obstacle in the way of their crossing her threshold: she was aware that in more than one of them she had found an ally, thanks to whom she had obtained a thousand things which she wanted but which M. de Guermantes pitilessly denied his wife so long as he was not in love with some one else. And so the reason why they were not invited by the Duchess until their intimacy with the Duke was already far advanced lay principally in the fact that he, every time that he had embarked on the deep waters of love, had imagined nothing more than a brief flirtation, as a reward for which he considered an invitation from his wife to be more than adequate. And yet he found himself offering this as the price of far less, for a first kiss in fact, because a resistance upon which he had never reckoned had been brought into play or because there had been no resistance. In love it often happens that gratitude, the desire to give pleasure, makes us generous beyond the limits of what the other person\u2019s expectation and self-interest could have anticipated. But then the realisation of this offer was hindered by conflicting circumstances. In the first place, all the women who had responded to M. de Guermantes\u2019s love, and sometimes even when they had not yet surrendered themselves to him, he had, one after another, segregated from the world. He no longer allowed them to see anyone, spent almost all his time in their company, looked after the education of their children to whom now and again, if one was to judge by certain speaking likenesses later on, he had occasion to present a little brother or sister. And so if, at the start of the connexion, the prospect of an introduction to Mme. de Guermantes, which had never crossed the mind of the Duke, had entered considerably into the thoughts of his mistress, their connexion had by itself altered the whole of the lady\u2019s point of view; the Duke was no longer for her merely the husband of the smartest woman in Paris, but a man with whom his new mistress was in love, a man moreover who had given her the means and the inclination for a more luxurious style of living and had transposed the relative importance in her mind of questions of social and of material advantage; while now and then a composite jealousy, into which all these factors entered, of Mme. de Guermantes animated the Duke\u2019s mistresses. But this case was the rarest of all; besides, when the day appointed for the introduction at length arrived (at a point when as a rule the Duke had lost practically all interest in the matter, his actions, like everyone\u2019s else, being generally dictated by previous actions the prime motive of which had already ceased to exist), it frequently happened that it was Mme. de Guermantes who had sought the acquaintance of the mistress in whom she hoped, and so greatly needed, to discover, against her dread husband, a valuable ally. This is not to say that, save at rare moments, in their own house, where, when the Duchess talked too much, he let fall a few words or, more dreadful still, preserved a silence which rendered her speechless, M. de Guermantes failed in his outward relations with his wife to observe what are called the forms. People who did not know them might easily misunderstand. Sometimes between the racing at Deauville, the course of waters and the return to Guermantes for the shooting, in the few weeks which people spend in Paris, since the Duchess had a liking for caf\u00e9-concerts, the Duke would go with her to spend the evening at one of these. The audience remarked at once, in one of those little open boxes in which there is just room for two, this Hercules in his \u2018smoking\u2019 (for in France we give to everything that is more or less British the one name that it happens not to bear in England), his monocle screwed in his eye, in his plump but finely shaped hand, on the ring-finger of which there glowed a sapphire, a plump cigar from which now and then he drew a puff of smoke, keeping his eyes for the most part on the stage but, when he did let them fall upon the audience in which there was absolutely no one whom he knew, softening them with an air of gentleness, reserve, courtesy and consideration. When a verse struck him as amusing and not too indecent, the Duke would turn round with a smile to his wife, letting her share, by a twinkle of good-natured understanding, the innocent merriment which the new song had aroused in himself. And the spectators might believe that there was no better husband in the world than this, nor anyone more enviable than the Duchess \u2014 that woman outside whom every interest in the Duke\u2019s life lay, that woman with whom he was not in love, to whom he had been consistently unfaithful; when the Duchess felt tired, they saw M. de Guermantes rise, put on her cloak with his own hands, arranging her necklaces so that they did not catch in the lining, and clear a path for her to the street with an assiduous and respectful attention which she received with the coldness of the woman of the world who sees in such behaviour simply conventional politeness, at times even with the slightly ironical bitterness of the disabused spouse who has no illusion left to shatter. But despite these externals (another element of that politeness which has made duty evolve from the depths of our being to the surface, at a period already remote but still continuing for its survivors) the life of the Duchess was by no means easy. M. de Guermantes never became generous or human save for a new mistress who would take, as it generally happened, the Duchess\u2019s part; the latter saw becoming possible for her once again generosities towards inferiors, charities to the poor, even for herself, later on, a new and sumptuous motor-car. But from the irritation which developed as a rule pretty rapidly in Mme. de Guermantes at people whom she found too submissive the Duke\u2019s mistresses were not exempt. Presently the Duchess grew tired of them. Simultaneously, at this moment, the Duke\u2019s intimacy with Mme. d\u2019Arpajon was drawing to an end. Another mistress dawned on the horizon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt the love which M. de Guermantes had had for each of them in succession would begin one day to make itself felt afresh; in the first place, this love in dying bequeathed them, like beautiful marbles \u2014 marbles beautiful to the Duke, become thus in part an artist, because he had loved them and was sensitive now to lines which he would not have appreciated without love \u2014 which brought into juxtaposition in the Duchess\u2019s drawing-room their forms long inimical, devoured by jealousies and quarrels, and finally reconciled in the peace of friendship; besides, this friendship itself was an effect of the love which had made M. de Guermantes observe in those who were his mistresses virtues which exist in every human being but are perceptible only to the sensual eye, so much so that the ex-mistr\u00eass, become \u2018the best of comrades\u2019 who would do anything in the world for one, is as recognised a type as the doctor or father who is not a doctor or a father but a friend. But during a period of transition the woman whom M. de Guermantes was preparing to abandon bewailed her lot, made scenes, shewed herself exacting, appeared indiscreet, became a nuisance. The Duke began to take a dislike to her. Then Mme. de Guermantes had an opportunity to bring into prominence the real or imagined defects of a person who annoyed her. Known as a kind woman, Mme. de Guermantes received the telephone messages, the confidences, the tears of the abandoned mistress and made no complaint. She laughed at them, first with her husband, then with a few chosen friends. And imagining that this pity which she shewed for the poor wretch gave her the right to make fun of her, even to her face, whatever the lady might say, provided it could be included among the attributes of the character for absurdity which the puke and Duchess had recently fabricated for her, Mme. de Guermantes had no hesitation in exchanging with her husband a glance of ironical connivance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, as she sat down to table, the Princesse de Parme remembered that she had thought of inviting a certain other Princess to the Opera, and, wishing to be assured that this would not in any way offend Mme. de Guermantes, was preparing to sound her. At this moment there entered M. de Grouchy, whose train, owing to some block on the line, had been held up for an hour. He made what excuses he could. His wife, had she been a Courvoisier, would have died of shame. But Mme. de Grouchy was not a Guermantes for nothing. As her husband was apologising for being late:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI see,\u201d she broke in, \u201cthat even in little things arriving late is a tradition in your family.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSit down, Grouchy, and don\u2019t let them pull your leg,\u201d said the Duke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope I move with the times, still I must admit that the Battle of Waterloo had its points, since it brought about the Restoration of the Bourbons, and better still in a way which made them unpopular. But you seem to be a regular Nimrod!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, as a matter of fact, I have had quite a good bag. I shall take the liberty of sending the Duchess six brace of pheasants to-morrow.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An idea seemed to flicker in the eyes of Mme. de Guermantes. She insisted that M. de Grouchy must not give himself the trouble of sending the pheasants. And making a sign to the betrothed footman with whom I had exchanged a few words on my way from the Elstir room:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPoullein,\u201d she told him, \u201cyou will go to-morrow and fetch M. le Comte\u2019s pheasants and bring them straight back \u2014 you won\u2019t mind, will you, Grouchy, if I make a few little presents. Basin and I can\u2019t eat a whole dozen by ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut the day after to-morrow will be soon enough,\u201d said M. de Grouchy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, to-morrow suits me better,\u201d the Duchess insisted\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Poullein had turned pale; his appointment with his sweetheart would have to be missed. This was quite enough for the diversion of the Duchess, who liked to appear to be taking a human interest in everyone. \u201cI know it\u2019s your day out,\u201d she went on to Poullein, \u201call you\u2019ve got to do is to change with Georges; he can take to-morrow off and stay in the day after.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the day after, Poullein\u2019s sweetheart would not be free. A holiday then was of no account to him. As soon as he was out of the room, everyone complimented the Duchess on the interest she took in her servants. \u201cBut I only behave towards them as I like people to behave to me.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s just it. They can say they\u2019ve found a good place with you.\u201d \u201cOh, nothing so very wonderful. But I think they all like me. That one is a little annoying because he\u2019s in love. He thinks it incumbent on him to go about with a long face.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point Poullein reappeared. \u201cYou\u2019re quite right,\u201d said M. de Grouchy, \u201che doesn\u2019t look much like smiling. With those fellows one has to be good but not too good.\u201d \u201cI admit I\u2019m not a very dreadful mistress. He\u2019ll have nothing to do all day but call for your pheasants, sit in the house doing nothing and eat his share of them.\u201d \u201cThere are plenty of people who would be glad to be in his place,\u201d said M. de Grouchy, for envy makes men blind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOriane,\u201d began the Princesse de Parme, \u201cI had a visit the other day from your cousin Heudicourt; of course she\u2019s a highly intelligent woman \u2014 she\u2019s a Guermantes, one can say no more, but they tell me she has a spitel ful tongue.\u201d The Duke fastened on his wife a slow gaze of deliberate stupefaction. Mme. de Guermantes began to smile. Gradually the Princess became aware of their pantomime. \u201cBut . . . do you mean to say you don\u2019t agree with me?\u201d she stammered with growing uneasiness. \u201cReally Ma\u2019am, it\u2019s too good of you to pay any attention to Basin\u2019s faces. Now\u2019 Basin, you\u2019re not to hint nasty things about our cousins.\u201d \u201cHe thinks her too wicked?\u201d inquired the Princess briskly. \u201cOh, dear me, no!\u201d replied the Duchess. \u201cI don\u2019t know who told your Highness that she was spiteful. On the contrary, she\u2019s an excellent creature who never said any harm of anyone, or did any harm to any one.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d sighed Mme. de Parme, greatly relieved. \u201cI must say I never noticed anything myself. But I know it\u2019s often difficult not to be a little spiteful when one is so full of wit . . . \u201d \u201cAh! Now that is a quality of which she has even less.\u201d \u201cLess wit?\u201d asked the stupefied Princess. \u201cCome now, Oriane,\u201d broke in the Duke in a plaintive tone, casting to right and left of him a glance of amusement, \u201cyou heard the Princess tell you that she was a superior woman.\u201d \u201cBut isn\u2019t she?\u201d \u201cSuperior in chest measurement, at any rate.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Ma\u2019am, he\u2019s not sincere; she\u2019s as stupid as a (h\u2019m) goose,\u201d came in a loud and rasping voice from Mme. de Guermantes, who, a great deal more \u2018old French\u2019 even than the Duke when he was not trying, did often deliberately seek to be, but in a manner the opposite of the lace-neckcloth, deliquescent style of her husband and in reality far more subtle, by a sort of almost peasant pronunciation which had a harsh and delicious flavour of the soil. \u201cBut she\u2019s the best woman in the world. Besides, I don\u2019t really know that one can call it stupidity when it\u2019s carried to such a point as that. I don\u2019t believe I ever met anyone quite like her; she\u2019s a case for a specialist, there\u2019s something pathological about her, she\u2019s a sort of \u2018innocent\u2019 or \u2018cretin\u2019 or an \u2018arrested development,\u2019 like the people you see in melodramas, or in L\u2019Arl\u00e9sienne. I always ask myself, when she comes to see me, whether the moment may not have arrived at which her intelligence is going to dawn, which makes me a little nervous always.\u201d The Princess was lost in admiration of these utterances but remained stupefied by the preceding verdict. \u201cShe repeated to me \u2014 and so did Mme. d\u2019Epinay \u2014 what you said about \u2018Teaser Augustus.\u2019 It\u2019s delicious,\u201d she put in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes explained the joke to me. I wanted to tell him that his brother, who pretended not to know me, was expecting me that same evening at eleven o\u2019clock. But I had not asked Robert whether I might mention this engagement, and as the fact that M. de Charlus had practically fixed it with me himself directly contradicted what he had told the Duchess I judged it more tactful to say nothing. \u201c\u2018Teaser Augustus\u2019 was not bad,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, \u201cbut Mme. d\u2019Heudicourt probably did not tell you a far better thing that Oriane said to her the other day in reply to an invitation to luncheon.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed! Do tell me!\u201d \u201cNow Basin, you keep quiet; in the first place, it was a stupid remark, and it will make the Princess think me inferior even to my fool of a cousin. Though I don\u2019t know why I should call her my cousin. She\u2019s one of Basin\u2019s cousins. Still, I believe she is related to me in some sort of way.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d cried the Princesse de Parme, at the idea that she could possibly think Mme. de Guermantes stupid, and protesting helplessly that nothing could ever lower the Duchess from the place she held in her estimation. \u201cBesides we have already subtracted from her the quality of wit; as what I said to her tends to deny her certain other good qualities also, it seems to me inopportune to repeat it.\u201d \u201c\u2018Deny her!\u2019 \u2018Inopportune!\u2019 How well she expresses herself!\u201d said the Duke with a pretence of irony, to win admiration for the Duchess. \u201cNow, then, Basin, you\u2019re not to make fun of your wife.\u201d \u201cI should explain to your Royal Highness,\u201d went on the Duke, \u201cthat Oriane\u2019s cousin may be superior, good, stout, anything you like to mention, but she is not exactly \u2014 what shall I say \u2014 lavish.\u201d \u201cNo, I know, she\u2019s terribly close-fisted,\u201d broke in the Princess. \u201cI should not have ventured to use the expression, but you have hit on exactly the right word. You can see it in her house-keeping, and especially in the cooking, which is excellent, but strictly rationed.\u201d \u201cWhich leads to some quite amusing scenes,\u201d M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 interrupted him. \u201cFor instance, my dear Basin, I was down at Heudicourt one day when you were expected, Oriane and yourself. They had made the most elaborate preparations when, during the afternoon, a footman brought in a telegram to say that you weren\u2019t coming.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me!\u201d said the Duchess, who not only was difficult to secure, but liked people to know as much. \u201cYour cousin read the telegram, was duly distressed, then immediately, without losing her head, telling herself that there was no point in going to unnecessary expense for so unimportant a gentleman as myself, called the footman back. \u2018Tell the cook not to put on the chicken!\u2019 she shouted after him. And that evening I heard her asking the butler: \u2018Well? What about the beef that was left over yesterday? Aren\u2019t you going to let us have that?\u2019\u201d \u201cAll the same, one must admit that the cheer you get there is of the very best,\u201d said the Duke, who fancied that in using this language he shewed himself to belong to the old school. \u201cI don\u2019t know any house where one gets better food.\u201d \u201cOr less,\u201d put in the Duchess. \u201cIt is quite wholesome and quite enough for what you would call a vulgar yokel like myself,\u201d went on the Duke, \u201cone keeps one\u2019s appetite.\u201d \u201cOh, if it\u2019s to be taken as a cure, it\u2019s certainly more hygienic than sumptuous. Not that it\u2019s as good as all that,\u201d added Mme. de Guermantes, who was not at all pleased that the title of \u2018best table in Paris\u2019 should be awarded to any but her own. \u201cWith my cousin it\u2019s just the same as with those costive authors who hatch out every fifteen years a one-act play or a sonnet. The sort of thing people call a little masterpiece, trifles that are perfect gems, in fact the one thing I loathe most in the world. The cooking at Z\u00e9na\u00efde\u2019s is not bad, but you would think it more ordinary if she was less parsimonious. There are some things her cook does quite well, and others that he spoils. I have had some thoroughly bad dinners there, as in most houses, only they\u2019ve done me less harm there because the stomach is, after all, more sensitive to quantity than to quality.\u201d \u201cWell, to get on with the story,\u201d the Duke concluded \u201cZ\u00e9na\u00efde insisted that Oriane should go to luncheon there, and as my wife is not very fond of going out anywhere she resisted, wanted to be sure that under the pretence of a quiet meal she was not being trapped into some great banquet, and tried in vain to find out who else were to be of the party. \u2018You must come,\u2019 Z\u00e9na\u00efde insisted, boasting of all the good things there would be to eat. \u2018You are going to have a pur\u00e9e of chestnuts, I need say no more than that, and there will be seven littlebouch\u00e9es \u00e0 la reine.\u2019 \u2018Seven little bouch\u00e9es!\u2019 cried Oriane, \u2018that means that we shall be at least eightl\u2019\u201d There was silence for a few seconds, and then the Princess having seen the point let her laughter explode like a peal of thunder. \u201cAh! \u2018Then we shall be eight,\u2019\u2014 it\u2019s exquisite. How very well phrased!\u201d she said, having by a supreme effort recaptured the expression she had heard used by Mme. d\u2019Epinay, which this time was more appropriate. \u201cOriane, that was very charming of the Princess, she said your remark was well phrased.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear, you\u2019re telling me nothing new. I know how clever the Princess is,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, who readily assimilated a remark when it was uttered at once by a Royal Personage and in praise of her own wit. \u201cI am very proud that Ma\u2019am should appreciate my humble phrasings. I don\u2019t remember, though, that I ever did say such a thing, and if I did it must have been to flatter my cousin, for if she had ordered seven \u2018mouthfuls,\u2019 the mouths, if I may so express myself, would have been a round dozen if not more.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe used to have all M. de Bornier\u2019s manuscripts,\u201d went on the Princess, still speaking of Mme. d\u2019Heudicourt, and anxious to make the most of the excellent reasons she might have for associating with that lady. \u201cShe must have dreamed it, I don\u2019t believe she ever even know him,\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cWhat is really interesting about him is that he kept up a correspondence with people of different nationalities at the same time,\u201d put in the Vicomtesse d\u2019Arpajon who, allied to the principal ducal and even reigning families of Europe, was always glad that people should be reminded of the fact. \u201cSurely, Oriane,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, with ulterior purpose, \u201cyou can\u2019t have forgotten that dinner-party where you had M. de Bornier sitting next to you!\u201d \u201cBut, Basin,\u201d the Duchess interrupted him, \u201cif you mean to inform me that I knew M. de Bornier, why of course I did, he even called upon me several times, but I could never bring myself to invite him to the house because I should always have been obliged to have it disinfected afterwards with formol. As for the dinner you mean, I remember it only too well, but it was certainly not at Z\u00e9na\u00efde\u2019s, who never set eyes on Bornier in her life, and would probably think if you spoke to her of the Fille de Roland that you meant a Bonaparte Princess who was said at one time to be engaged to the son of the King of Greece; no, it was at the Austrian Embassy. Dear Hoyos imagined he was giving me a great treat by planting on the chair next to mine that pestiferous academician. I quite thought I had a squadron of mounted police sitting beside me. I was obliged to stop my nose as best I could, all through dinner; until the gruy\u00e8re came round I didn\u2019t dare to breathe.\u201d M. de Guermantes, whose secret object was attained, made a furtive examination of his guests\u2019 faces to judge the effect of the Duchess\u2019s pleasantry. \u201cYou were speaking of correspondence; I must say, I thought Gambetta\u2019s admirable,\u201d she went on, to shew that she was not afraid to be found taking an interest in a proletarian and a radical. M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, who fully appreciated the brilliance of this feat of daring, gazed round him with an eye at once flashing and affectionate, after which he wiped his monocle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGad, it\u2019s infernally dull that Fille de Roland,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, with the satisfaction which he derived from the sense of his own superiority to a work which had bored him so, perhaps also from the suave mari magno feeling one has in the middle of a good dinner, when one recalls so terrible an evening in the past. \u201cStill, there were some quite good lines in it, and a patriotic sentiment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I let it be understood that I had no admiration for M. de Bornier. \u201cIndeed! You have some fault to find with him?\u201d the Duke asked with a note of curiosity, for he always imagined when anyone spoke ill of a man that it must be on account of a personal resentment, just as to speak well of a woman marked the beginning of a love-affair. \u201cI see you\u2019ve got your knife into him. What did he do to you? You must tell us. Why yes, there must be some skeleton in the cupboard or you wouldn\u2019t run him down. It\u2019s long-winded, the Fille de Roland, but it\u2019s quite strong in parts.\u201d \u201cStrong is just the right word for an author who smelt like that,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes broke in sarcastically. \u201cIf this poor boy ever found himself face to face with him, I can quite understand that he carried away an impression in his nostrils!\u201d \u201cI must confess, though, to Ma\u2019am,\u201d the Duke went on, addressing the Princesse de Parme, \u201cthat quite apart from theFille de Roland, in literature and even in music I am terribly old-fashioned; no old nightingale can be too stale for my taste. You won\u2019t believe me, perhaps, but in the evenings, if my wife sits down to the piano, I find myself calling for some old tune by Auber or Boieldieu, or even Beethoven! That\u2019s the sort of thing that appeals to me. As for Wagner, he sends me to sleep at once.\u201d \u201cYou are wrong there,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cin spite of his insufferable long-windedness, Wagner was a genius. Lohengrin is a masterpiece. Even in Tristan there are some amusing passages scattered about. And the Chorus of Spinners in the Flying Dutchman is a perfect marvel.\u201d \u201cA\u2019n\u2019t I right, Babal,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, turning to M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, \u201cwhat we like is:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Les rendez-vous de noble compagnie\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Se donnent tous en ce charmant s\u00e9jour\n\nIt\u2019s delicious. And Fra Diavolo, and the Magic Flute, and the Chalet, and the Marriage of Figaro, and the Diamants de la Couronne \u2014 there\u2019s music for you! It\u2019s the same thing in literature. For instance, I adore Balzac, theBal de Sceaux, the Mohicans de Paris.\u201d \u201cOh, my dear, if you are going to begin about Balzac, we shall never hear the end of it; do wait, keep it for some evening when M\u00e9m\u00e9\u2018s here. He\u2019s even better, he knows it all by heart.\u201d Irritated by his wife\u2019s interruption, the Duke held her for some seconds under the fire of a menacing silence. And his huntsman\u2019s eyes reminded me of a brace of loaded pistols. Meanwhile Mme. d\u2019Arpajon had been exchanging with the Princesse de Parme, upon tragic and other kinds of poetry, a series of remarks which did not reach me distinctly until I caught the following from Mme. d\u2019Arpajon: \u201cOh, Ma\u2019am is sure to be right; I quite admit he makes the world seem ugly, because he\u2019s unable to distinguish between ugliness and beauty, or rather because his insufferable vanity makes him believe that everything he says is beautiful; I agree with your Highness that in the piece we are speaking of there are some ridiculous things, quite unintelligible, errors of taste, that it is difficult to understand, that it\u2019s as much trouble to read as if it was written in Russian or Chinese, for of course it\u2019s anything in the world but French, still when one has taken the trouble, how richly one is rewarded, it\u2019s so full of imagination!\u201d Of this little lecture I had missed the opening sentences. I gathered in the end not only that the poet incapable of distinguishing between beauty and ugliness was Victor Hugo, but furthermore that the poem which was as difficult to understand as Chinese or Russian was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lorsque l\u2019enfant para\u00eet, le cercle de famille\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applaudit \u00e0 grands cris\n\nA piece dating from the poet\u2019s earliest period, and perhaps even nearer to Mme. Deshouli\u00e8res than to the Victor Hugo of the L\u00e9gende des Si\u00e8cles. Far from condemning Mme. d\u2019Arpajon as absurd, I saw her (the only one, at that table so matter-of-fact, so nondescript, at which I had sat down with such keen disappointment), I saw her in my mind\u2019s eye crowned with that lace cap, with the long spiral ringlets falling from it on either side, which was worn by Mme. de R\u00e9musat, Mme. de Broglie, Mme. de Saint-Aularie, all those distinguished women who in their fascinating letters quote with so much learning and so aptly passages from Sophocles, Schiller and theImitation, but in whom the earliest poetry of the Romantics induced the alarm and exhaustion inseparable for my grandmother from the latest verses of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. \u201cMme. d\u2019Arpajon is very fond of poetry,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme to her hostess, impressed by the ardent tone in which the speech had been delivered. \u201cNo; she knows absolutely nothing about it,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes in an undertone, taking advantage of the fact that Mme. d\u2019Arpajon, who was dealing with an objection raised by General de Beautreillis, was too much intent upon what she herself was saying to hear what was being murmured by the Duchess. \u201cShe has become literary since she\u2019s been forsaken. I can tell your Highness that it is I who have to bear the whole burden of it because it is to me that she comes in floods of tears whenever Basin hasn\u2019t been to see her, which is practically every day. And yet it isn\u2019t my fault, after all, if she bores him, and I can\u2019t force him to go to her, although I would rather he were a little more faithful to her, because then I shouldn\u2019t see quite so much of her myself. But she drives him crazy, and there\u2019s nothing extraordinary in that. She isn\u2019t a bad sort, but she\u2019s boring to a degree you can\u2019t imagine. And all this because Basin took it into his head for a year or so to play me false with her. And to have in addition a footman who has fallen in love with a little street-walker and goes about with a long face if I don\u2019t request the young person to leave her profitable pavement for half an hour and come to tea with me! Oh! Life really is too tedious!\u201d the Duchess languorously concluded. Mme. d\u2019Arpajon bored M. de Guermantes principally because he had recently fallen in love with another, whom I discovered to be the Marquise de Surgis-le-Duc. At this moment the footman who had been deprived of his holiday was waiting at table. And it struck me that, still disconsolate, he was doing it with a good deal of difficulty, for I noticed that, in handing the dish to M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault, he performed his task so awkwardly that the Duke\u2019s elbow came in contact several times with his own. The young Duke was not in the least annoyed with the blushing footman, but looked up at him rather with a smile in his clear blue eyes. This good humour seemed to me on the guest\u2019s part to betoken a kindness of heart. But the persistence of his smile led me to think that, aware of the servant\u2019s discomfiture, what he felt was perhaps really a malicious joy. \u201cBut, my dear, you know you\u2019re not revealing any new discovery when you tell us about Victor Hugo,\u201d went on the Duchess, this time addressing Mme. d\u2019Arpajon whom she had just seen turn away from the General with a troubled air. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t expect to launch that young genius. Everybody knows that he has talent. What is utterly detestable is the Victor Hugo of the last stage, the L\u00e9gende des Si\u00e8cles, I forget all their names. But in the Feuilles d\u2019Automne, the Chants du Cr\u00e9puscule, there\u2019s a great deal that\u2019s the work of a poet, a true poet! Even in theContemplations,\u201d went on the Duchess, whom none of her listeners dared to contradict, and with good reason, \u201cthere are still some quite pretty things. But I confess that I prefer not to venture farther than theCrepuscule! And then in the finer poems of Victor Hugo, and there really are some, one frequently comes across an idea, even a profound idea.\u201d And with the right shade of sentiment, bringing out the sorrowful thought with the full strength of her intonation, planting it somewhere beyond the sound of her voice, and fixing straight in front of her a charming, dreamy gaze, the Duchess said slowly: \u201cTake this:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0La douleur est un fruit\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0.Dieu ne le fait pas cro\u00eetre\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sur la branche trop faible encor pour le porter\n\nOr, better still:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Les morts durent bien peu\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0H\u00e9las, dans le cercueil ils tombent en poussi\u00e8re\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moins vite qu\u2019en nos coeurs!\u201d\n\nAnd, while a smile of disillusionment contracted with a graceful undulation her sorrowing lips, the Duchess fastened on Mme. d\u2019Arpajon the dreaming gaze of her charming, clear blue eyes. I was beginning to know them, as well as her voice, with its heavy drawl, its harsh savour. In those eyes and in that voice, I recognised much of the life of nature round Combray. Certainly, in the affectation with which that voice brought into prominence at times a rudeness of the soil there was more than one element: the wholly provincial origin of one branch of the Guermantes family, which had for long remained more localised, more hardy, wilder, more provoking than the rest; and also the usage of really distinguished people, and of witty people who know that distinction does not consist in mincing speech, and the usage of nobles who fraternise more readily with their peasants than with the middle classes; peculiarities all of which the regal position of Mme. de Guermantes enabled her to display more easily to bring out with every sail spread. It appears that the same voice existed also in certain of her sisters whom she detested, and who, less intelligent than herself and almost plebeianly married, if one may coin this adverb to speak of unions with obscure noblemen, entrenched on their provincial estates, or, in Paris, in a Faubourg Saint-Germain of no brilliance, possessed this voice also but had bridled it, corrected it, softened it so far as lay in their power, just as it is very rarely that any of us presumes on his own originality and does not apply himself diligently to copying the most approved models. But Oriane was so much more intelligent, so much richer, above all, so much more in fashion than her sisters, she had so effectively, when Princesse des Laumes, behaved just as she pleased in the company of the Prince of Wales, that she had realised that this discordant voice was an attraction, and had made of it, in the social order, with the courage of originality rewarded by success, what in the theatrical order a R\u00e9jane, a Jeanne Granier (which implies no comparison, naturally, between the respective merits and talents of those two actresses) had made of theirs, something admirable and distinctive which possibly certain R\u00e9jane and Granier sisters, whom no one has ever known, strove to conceal as a defect\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To all these reasons for displaying her local originality, the favourite writers of Mme. de Guermantes \u2014 M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy \u2014 had brought in addition, with the respect for what was natural, a feeling for the prosaic by which she attained to poetry and a spirit purely of society which called up distant landscapes before my eyes. Besides, the Duchess was fully capable, adding to these influences an artistic research of her own, of having chosen for the majority of her words the pronunciation that seemed to her most \u2018He de France,\u2019 most \u2018Champenoise,\u2019 since, if not quite to the same extent as her sister-in-law Marsantes, she rarely used anything but the pure vocabulary that might have been employed by an old French writer. And when one was tired of the composite patchwork of modern speech, it was, albeit one was aware that she expressed far fewer ideas, a thorough relaxation to listen to the talk of Mme. de Guermantes \u2014 almost the same feeling, if one was alone with her and she restrained and clarified still further her flow of words, as one has on hearing an old song. Then, as I looked at, as I listened to Mme. de Guermantes, I could see, a prisoner in the perpetual and quiet afternoon of her eyes, a sky of the He de France or of Champagne spread itself, grey-blue, oblique, with the same angle of inclination as in the eyes of Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, by these several formations, Mme. de Guermantes expressed at once the most ancient aristocratic France, then, from a far later source, the manner in which the Duchesse de Broglie might have enjoyed and found fault with Victor Hugo under the July Monarchy, and, finally, a keen taste for the literature that sprang from M\u00e9rim\u00e9e and Meilhac. The first of these formations attracted me more than the second, did more to console me for the disappointments of my pilgrimage to and arrival in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, so different from what I had imagined it to be; but even the second I preferred to the last. For, so long as Mme. de Guermantes was being, almost spontaneously, a Guermantes and nothing more, her Pailleronism, her taste for the younger Dumas were reflected and deliberate. As this taste was the opposite of my own, she was productive, to my mind, of literature when she talked to me of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and never seemed to me so stupidly Faubourg Saint-Germain as when she was talking literature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moved by this last quotation, Mme. d\u2019Arpajon exclaimed: \u201c\u2019Ces reliques du coeur ont aussi leur poussi\u00e8re!\u2019 Sir, you must write that down for me on my fan,\u201d she said to M. de Guermantes. \u201cPoor woman, I feel sorry for her!\u201d said the Princesse de Parme to Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cNo, really, Ma\u2019am, you must not be soft-hearted, she has only got what she deserves.\u201d \u201cBut \u2014 you\u2019ll forgive me for saying this to you \u2014 she does really love him all the same!\u201d \u201cOh, not at all; she isn\u2019t capable of it; she thinks she loves him just as she thought just now she was quoting Victor Hugo, when she repeated a line from Musset. Listen,\u201d the Duchess went on in a tone of melancholy, \u201cnobody would be more touched than myself by any true sentiment. But let me give you an instance. Only yesterday, she made a terrible scene with Basin. Your Highness thinks perhaps that it was because he\u2019s in love with other women, because he no longer loves her; not in the least, it was because he won\u2019t put her sons down for the Jockey. Does Ma\u2019am call that the behaviour of a woman in love? No; I will go farther;\u201d Mme. de Guermantes added with precision, \u201cshe is a person of singular insensibility.\u201d Meanwhile it was with an eye sparkling with satisfaction that M. de Guermantes had listened to his wife talking about Victor Hugo \u2018point-blank\u2019 and quoting his poetry. The Duchess might frequently annoy him; at moments like this he was proud of her. \u201cOriane is really extraordinary. She can talk about anything, she has read everything. She could not possibly have guessed that the conversation this evening would turn on Victor Hugo. Whatever subject you take up, she is ready for you, she can hold her own with the most learned scholars. This young man must be quite captivated.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo let us change the conversation,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes went on, \u201cbecause she\u2019s dreadfully susceptible. You will think me quite old-fashioned,\u201d she began, turning to me. \u201cI know that nowadays it\u2019s considered a weakness to care for ideas in poetry, poetry with some thought in it.\u201d \u201cOld-fashioned?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme, quivering with the slight thrill sent through her by this new wave which she had not expected, albeit she knew that the conversation of the Duchesse de Guermantes always held in store for her these continuous and delightful shocks, that breath-catching panic, that wholesome exhaustion after which her thoughts instinctively turned to the necessity of taking a footbath in a dressing cabin and a brisk walk to \u2018restore her circulation.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFor my part, no, Oriane,\u201d said Mme. de Brissac, \u201cI don\u2019t in the least object to Victor Hugo\u2019s having ideas, quite the contrary, but I do object to his seeking for them in sheer monstrosities. After all, it was he who accustomed us to ugliness in literature. There are quite enough ugly things already in real life. Why can\u2019t we be allowed at least to forget it while we are reading. A distressing spectacle, from which we should turn away in real life, that is what attracts Victor Hugo.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVictor Hugo is not as realistic as Zola though, surely?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme. The name of Zola did not stir a muscle on the face of M. de Beautreillis. The General\u2019s anti-Dreyfusism was too deep-rooted for him to seek to give expression to it. And his good-natured silence when anyone broached these topics moved the profane heart as a proof of the same delicacy that a priest shews in avoiding any reference to your religious duties, a financier when he takes care not to recommend your investing in the companies which he himself controls, a strong man when he behaves with lamblike gentleness and does not hit you in the jaw. \u201cI know you\u2019re related to Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re,\u201d was murmured to me with an air of connivance by Mme. de Varambon, the lady in waiting to the Princesse de Parme, an excellent but limited woman, procured for the Princess in the past by the Duke\u2019s mother. She had not previously uttered a word to me, and I could never afterwards, despite the admonitions of the Princess and my own protestations, get out of her mind the idea that I was in some way connected with the Academician Admiral, who was a complete stranger to me. The obstinate persistence of the Princesse de Parme\u2019s lady in waiting in seeing in me a nephew of Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re was in itself quite an ordinary form of silliness. But the mistake she made was only a crowning instance of all the other mistakes, less serious, more elaborate, unconscious or deliberate, which accompany one\u2019s name on the label which society writes out and attaches to one. I remember that a friend of the Guermantes who had expressed a keen desire to meet me gave me as the reason that I was a great friend of his cousin, Mme. de Chaussegros. \u201cShe is a charming person, she\u2019s so fond of you.\u201d I scrupulously, though quite vainly, insisted on the fact that there must be some mistake, as I did not know Mme. de Chaussegros. \u201cThen it\u2019s her sister you know; it comes to the same thing. She met you in Scotland.\u201d I had never been in Scotland, and took the futile precaution, in my honesty, of letting my informant know this. It was Mme. de Chaussegros herself who had said that she knew me, and no doubt sincerely believed it, as a result of some initial confusion, for from that time onwards she never failed to hold out her hand to me whenever she saw me. And as, after all, the world in which I moved was precisely that in which Mme. de Chaussegros moved my modesty had neither rhyme nor reason. To say that I was intimate with the Chaussegros was, literally, a mistake, but from the social point of view was to state an equivalent of my position, if one can speak of the social position of so young a man as I then was. It therefore mattered not in the least that this friend of the Guermantes should tell me only things that were false about myself, he neither lowered nor exalted me (from the worldly point of view) in the idea which he continued to hold of me. And when all is said, for those of us who are not professional actors the tedium of living always in the same character is removed for a moment, as if we were to go on the boards, when another person forms a false idea of us, imagines that we are friends with a lady whom we do not know and are reported to have met in the course of a delightful tour of a foreign country which we have never made. Errors that multiply themselves and are harmless when they have not the inflexible rigidity of this one which had been committed, and continued for the rest of her life to be committed, in spite of my denials, by the imbecile lady in waiting to Mme. de Parme, rooted for all time in the belief that I was related to the tiresome Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re. \u201cShe is not very strong in her head,\u201d the Duke confided to me, \u201cand besides, she ought not to indulge in too many libations. I fancy, she\u2019s slightly under the influence of Bacchus.\u201d As a matter of fact Mme. de Varambon had drunk nothing but water, but the Duke liked to find scope for his favourite figures of speech. \u201cBut Zola is not a realist, Ma\u2019am, he\u2019s a poet!\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, drawing inspiration from the critical essays which she had read in recent years and adapting them to her own personal genius. Agreeably buffeted hitherto, in the course of this bath of wit, a bath stirred for herself, which she was taking this evening and which, she considered, must be particularly good for her health, letting herself be swept away by the waves of paradox which curled and broke one after another, before this, the most enormous of them all, the Princesse de Parme jumped for fear of being knocked over. And it was in a choking voice, as though she were quite out of breath, that she now gasped: \u201cZola a poet!\u201d \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d answered the Duchess with a laugh, entranced by this display of suffocation. \u201cYour Highness must have remarked how he magnifies everything he touches. You will tell me that he touches just what \u2014 perish the thought! But he makes it into something colossal. His is the epic dungheap. He is the Homer of the sewers! He has not enough capitals to print Cambronne\u2019s word.\u201d Despite the extreme exhaustion which she was beginning to feel, the Princess was enchanted; never had she felt better. She would not have exchanged for an invitation to Schonbrunn, albeit that was the one thing that really flattered her, these divine dinner-parties at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s, made invigorating by so liberal a dose of attic salt. \u201cHe writes it with a big C,\u201d cried Mme. d\u2019Arpajon. \u201cSurely with a big M, I think, my dear,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, exchanging first with her husband a merry glance which implied: \u201cDid you ever hear such an idiot?\u201d \u201cWait a minute, now.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes turned to me, fixing on me a tender, smiling gaze, because, as an accomplished hostess, she was anxious to display her own knowledge of the artist who interested me specially, to give me, if I required it, an opportunity for exhibiting mine. \u201cWait,\u201d she urged me, gently waving her feather fan, so conscious was she at this moment that she was performing in full the duties of hospitality, and, that she might be found wanting in none of them, making a sign also to the servants to help me to more of the asparagus and mousseline sauce: \u201cwait, now, I do believe that Zola has actually written an essay on Elstir, the painter whose things you were looking at just now \u2014 the only ones of his, really, that I care for,\u201d she concluded. As a matter of fact sh hated Elstir\u2019s work, but found a unique quality in anything that was in her own house. I asked M. de Guermantes if he knew the name of the gentleman in the tall hat who figured in the picture of the crowd and whom I recognised as the same person whose portrait the Guermantes also had and had hung beside the other, both dating more or less from the same early period in which Elstir\u2019s personality was not yet completely established and he derived a certain inspiration from Manet. \u201cGood Lord, yes,\u201d he replied, \u201cI know it\u2019s a fellow who is quite well-known and no fool either in his own line, but I have no head for names. I have it on the tip of my tongue, Monsieur. . . . Monsieur. . . . oh, well, it doesn\u2019t matter, I can\u2019t remember it. Swann would be able to tell you, it was he who made Mme. de Guermantes buy all that stuff; she is always too good-natured, afraid of hurting people\u2019s feelings if she refuses to do things; between ourselves, I believe he\u2019s landed us with a lot of rubbish. What I can tell you is that the gentleman you mean has been a sort of Maecenas to M. Elstir, he started him and has often helped him out of tight places by ordering pictures from him. As a compliment to this man \u2014 if you can call that sort of thing a compliment \u2014 he has painted him standing about among that crowd, where with his Sunday-go-to-meeting look he creates a distinctly odd effect. He may be a big gun in his own way but he is evidently not aware of the proper time and place for a top hat. With that thing on his head, among all those bare-headed girls, he looks like a little country lawyer on the razzle-dazzle. But tell me, you seem quite gone on his pictures. If I had only known, I should have got up the subject properly. Not that there\u2019s any need to rack one\u2019s brains over the meaning of M. Elstir\u2019s work, as one would for Ingres\u2019s Source or the Princes in the Towier by Paul Delaroche. What one appreciates in his work is that it\u2019s shrewdly observed, amusing, Parisian, and then one passes on to the next thing. One doesn\u2019t need to be an expert to look at that sort of thing. I know of course that they\u2019re merely sketches, still, I don\u2019t feel myself that he puts enough work into them. Swann was determined that we should buy aBundle of Asparagus. In fact it was in the house for several days. There was nothing else in the picture, a bundle of asparagus exactly like what you\u2019re eating now. But I must say I declined to swallow M. Elstir\u2019s asparagus. He asked three hundred francs for them. Three hundred francs for a bundle of asparagus. A louis, that\u2019s as much as they\u2019re worth, even if they are out of season. I thought it a bit stiff. When he puts real people into his pictures as well, there\u2019s something rather caddish, something detrimental about him which does not appeal to me. I am surprised to see a delicate mind, a superior brain like yours admire that sort of thing.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why you should say that, Basin,\u201d interrupted the Duchess, who did not like to hear people run down anything that her rooms contained. \u201cI am by no means prepared to admit that there\u2019s nothing distinguished in Elstir\u2019s pictures. You have to take it or leave it. But it\u2019s not always lacking in talent. And you must admit that the ones I bought are singularly beautiful.\u201d \u201cWell, Oriane, in that style of thing I\u2019d a thousand times rather have the little study by M. Vibert we saw at the water-colour exhibition. There\u2019s nothing much in it, if you like, you could take it in the palm of your hand, but you can see the man\u2019s clever through and through: that unwashed scarecrow of a missionary standing before the sleek prelate who is making his little dog do tricks, it\u2019s a perfect little poem of subtlety, and in fact goes really deep.\u201d \u201cI believe you know M. Elstir,\u201d the Duchess went on to me, \u201cas a man, he\u2019s quite pleasant.\u201d \u201cHe is intelligent,\u201d said the Duke; \u201cone is surprised, when one talks to him, that his painting should be so vulgar.\u201d \u201cHe is more than intelligent, he is really quite clever,\u201d said the Duchess in the confidently critical tone of a person who knew what she was talking about. \u201cDidn\u2019t he once start a portrait of you, Oriane?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme. \u201cYes, in shrimp pink,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cbut that\u2019s not going to hand his name down to posterity. It\u2019s a ghastly thing; Basin wanted to have it destroyed.\u201d This last statement was one which Mme. de Guermantes often made. But at other times her appreciation of the picture was different: \u201cI do not care for his painting, but he did once do a good portrait of me.\u201d The former of these judgments was addressed as a rule to people who spoke to the Duchess of her portrait, the other to those who did not refer to it and whom therefore she was anxious to inform of its existence. The former was inspired in her by coquetry, the latter by vanity. \u201cMake a portrait of you look ghastly! Why, then it can\u2019t be a portrait, it\u2019s a falsehood; I don\u2019t know one end of a brush from the other, but I\u2019m sure if I were to paint you, merely putting you down as I see you, I should produce a masterpiece,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme ingenuously. \u201cHe sees me probably as I see myself, without any allurements,\u201d said the Duchesse de Guermantes, with the look, melancholy, modest and coaxing, which seemed to her best calculated to make her appear different from what Elstir had portrayed. \u201cThat portrait ought to appeal to Mme. de Gallardon,\u201d said the Duke. \u201cBecause she knows nothing about pictures?\u201d asked the Princesse de Parme, who knew that Mme. de Guermantes had an infinite contempt for her cousin. \u201cBut she\u2019s a very good woman, isn\u2019t she?\u201d The Duke assumed an air of profound astonishment. \u201cWhy, Basin, don\u2019t you see the Princess is making fun of you?\u201d (The Princess had never dreamed of doing such a thing.) \u201cShe knows as well as you do that Gallardonette is an old poison,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes, whose vocabulary, limited as a rule to all these old expressions, was as savoury as those dishes which it is possible to come across in the delicious books of Pampille, but which have in real life become so rare, dishes where the jellies, the butter, the gravy, the quails are all genuine, permit of no alloy, where even the salt is brought specially from the salt-marshes of Brittany; from her accent, her choice of words, one felt that the basis of the Duchess\u2019s conversation came directly from Guermantes. In this way the Duchess differed profoundly from her nephew Saint-Loup, the prey of so many new ideas and expressions; it is difficult, when one\u2019s mind is troubled by the ideas of Kant and the longings of Baudelaire, to write the exquisite French of Henri IV, which meant that the very purity of the Duchess\u2019s language was a sign of limitation, and that, in her, both her intelligence and her sensibility had remained proof against all innovation. Here again, Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s mind attracted me just because of what it excluded was exactly the content of my own thoughts) and by everything which by virtue of that exclusion, it had been able to preserve, that seductive vigour of the supple bodies which no exhausting necessity to think no moral anxiety or nervous trouble has deformed. Her mind, of a formation so anterior to my own, was for me the equivalent of what had been offered me by the procession of the girls of the little band along the seashore Mme. de Guermantes offered me, domesticated and held in subjection by her natural courtesy, by the respect due to another person\u2019s intellectual worth, all the energy and charm of a cruel little girl of one of the noble families round Combray who from her childhood had been brought up in the saddle, tortured cats, gouged out the eyes of rabbits, and; albeit she had remained a pillar of virtue, might equally well have been, a good few years ago now, the most brilliant mistress of the Prince de Sagan. Only she was incapable of realising what I had sought for in her, the charm of her historic name, and the tiny quantity of it that I had found in her, a rustic survival from Guermantes. Were our relations founded upon a misunderstanding which could not fail to become manifest as soon as my homage, instead of being addressed to the relatively superior woman that she believed herself to be, should be diverted to some other woman of equal mediocrity and breathing the same unconscious charm? A misunderstanding so entirely natural, and one that will always exist between a young dreamer like myself and a woman of the world, one however that profoundly disturbs him, so long as he has not yet discovered the nature of his imaginative faculties and has not acquired his share of the inevitable disappointments which he is destined to find in people, as in the theatre, in his travels and indeed in love. M. de Guermantes having declared (following upon Elstir\u2019s asparagus and those that were brought round after the financi\u00e8re chicken) that green asparagus grown in the open air, which, as has been so quaintly said by the charming writer who signs himself E. de Clermont-Tonnerre, \u201chave not the impressive rigidity of their sisters,\u201d ought to be eaten with eggs: \u201cOne man\u2019s meat is another man\u2019s poison, as they say,\u201d replied M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. \u201cIn the province of Canton, in China, the greatest delicacy that can be set before one is a dish of ortolan\u2019s eggs completely rotten.\u201d M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, the author of an essay on the Mormons which had appeared in the Revue des Deux Mondes, moved in none but the most aristocratic circles, but among these visited only such as had a certain reputation for intellect, with the result that from his presence, were it at all regular, in a woman\u2019s house one could tell that she had a \u2018salon.\u2019 He pretended to a loathing of society, and assured each of his duchesses in turn that it was for the sake of her wit and beauty that he came to see her. They all believed him. Whenever, with death in his heart, he resigned himself to attending a big party at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s, he summoned them all to accompany him, to keep up his courage, and thus appeared only to be moving in the midst of an intimate group. So that his reputation as an intellectual might survive his worldly success, applying certain maxims of the Guermantes spirit, he would set out with ladies of fashion on long scientific expeditions at the height of the dancing season, and when a woman who was a snob, and consequently still without any definite position, began to go everywhere, he would put a savage obstinacy into his refusal to know her, to allow himself to be introduced to her. His hatred of snobs was a derivative of his snobbishness, but made the simpletons (in other words, everyone) believe that he was immune from snobbishness. \u201cBabal always knows everything,\u201d exclaimed the Duchesse de Guermantes. \u201cI think it must be charming, a country where you can be quite sure that your dairyman will supply you with really rotten eggs, eggs of the year of the comet. I can see myself dipping my bread and butter in them. I must say, you get the same thing at aunt Madeleine\u2019s\u201d (Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s) \u201cwhere everything\u2019s served in a state of putrefaction, eggs included.\u201d Then, as Mme. d\u2019Arpajon protested, \u201cBut my dear Phili, you know it as well as I do. You can see the chicken in the egg. What I can\u2019t understand is how they manage not to fall out. It\u2019s not an omelette you get there, it\u2019s a poultry-yard. You were so wise not to come to dinner there yesterday, there was a brill cooked in carbolic! I assure you, it wasn\u2019t a dinner-table, it was far more like an operating-table. Really, Norpois carries loyalty to the pitch of heroism. He actually asked for more!\u201d \u201cI believe I saw you at dinner there the time she made that attack on M. Bloch\u201d (M. de Guermantes, perhaps to give to an Israelite name a more foreign sound, pronounced the \u2018ch\u2019 in Bloch not like a \u2018k\u2019 but as in the German \u2018hoch\u2019) \u201cwhen he said about some poit\u201d (poet) \u201cor other that he was sublime. Ch\u00e2tellerault did his best to break M. Bloch\u2019s shins, the fellow didn\u2019t understand in the least and thought my nephew\u2019s kick was aimed at a young woman sitting opposite him.\u201d (At this point, M. de Guermantes coloured slightly.) \u201cHe did not realise that he was annoying our aunt by his \u2018sublimes\u2019 chucked about all over the place like that. In short, aunt Madeleine, who doesn\u2019t keep her tongue in her pocket, turned on him with: \u2018Indeed, Sir, and what epithet do you keep for M. de Bousset?\u2019\u201d (M. de Guermantes thought that, when one mentioned a famous name, the use of \u2018Monsieur\u2019 and a particle was eminently \u2018old school.\u2019) \u201cThat put him in his place, all right.\u201d \u201cAnd what answer did this M. Bloch make?\u201d came in a careless tone from Mme. de Guermantes, who, running short for the moment of original ideas, felt that she must copy her husband\u2019s teutonic pronunciation. \u201cAh! I can assure you, M. Bloch did not wait for any more, he\u2019s still running.\u201d \u201cYes, I remember quite well seeing you there that evening,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes with emphasis as though, coming from her, there must be something in this reminiscence highly flattering to myself. \u201cIt is always so interesting at my aunt\u2019s. At the last party she gave, which was, of course, when I met you, I meant to ask you whether that old gentleman who went past where we were, sitting wasn\u2019t Fran\u00e7ois Copp\u00e9e. You must know who everyone is,\u201d she went on, sincerely envious of my relations with poets and poetry, and also out of \u2018consideration\u2019 for myself, the wish to establish in a better position in the eyes of her other guests a young man so well versed in literature. I assured the Duchess that I had not observed any celebrities at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s party. \u201cWhat!\u201d she replied with a bewilderment which revealed that her respect for men of letters and her contempt for society were more superficial than she said, perhaps even than she thought, \u201cWhat! There were no famous authors there! You astonish me! Why, I saw all sorts of quite impossible people!\u201d I remembered the evening in question distinctly owing to an entirely trivial incident that had occurred at the party. Mme. de Villeparisis had introduced Bloch to Mme. Alphonse de Rothschild, but my friend had not caught the name and, thinking he was talking to an old English lady who was a trifle mad had replied only in monosyllables to the garrulous conversation of the historic beauty, when Mme. de Villeparisis in making her known to some one else uttered, quite distinctly this time: \u201cThe Baronne Alphonse de Rothschild.\u201d Thereupon there had coursed suddenly and simultaneously through Bloch\u2019s arteries so many ideas of millions and of social importance, which it would have been more prudent to subdivide and separate, that he had undergone, so to speak, a momentary failure of heart and brain alike, and cried aloud in the dear old lady\u2019s presence: \u201cIf I\u2019d only known!\u201d an exclamation the silliness of which kept him from sleeping for at least a week afterwards. His remark was of no great interest, but I remembered it as a proof that sometimes in this life, under the stress of an exceptional emotion, people do say what is in their minds. \u201cI fancy Mme. de Villeparisis is not absolutely . . . moral,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, who knew that the best people did not visit the Duchess\u2019s aunt, and, from what the Duchess herself had just been saying, that one might speak freely about her. But, Mme. de Guermantes not seeming to approve of this criticism, she hastened to add: \u201cThough, of course, intellect carried to that degree excuses everything.\u201d \u201cBut you take the same view of my aunt that everyone else does,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cwhich is, really, quite mistaken. It\u2019s just what M\u00e9m\u00e9 was saying to me only yesterday.\u201d She blushed; a reminiscence unknown to me filmed her eyes. I formed the supposition that M. de Charlus had asked her to cancel my invitation, as he had sent Robert to ask me not to go to her house. I had the impression that the blush \u2014 equally incomprehensible to me \u2014 which had tinged the Duke\u2019s cheek when he made some reference to his brother could not be attributed to the same cause. \u201cMy poor aunt \u2014 she will always have the reputation of being a lady of the old school, of sparkling wit and uncontrolled passions. And really there\u2019s no more middle-class, serious, commonplace mind in Paris. She will go down as a patron of the arts, which means to say that she was once the mistress of a great painter, though he was never able to make her understand what a picture was; and as for her private life, so far from being a depraved woman, she was so much made for marriage, so conjugal from her cradle that, not having succeeded in keeping a husband, who incidentally was a cad, she has never had a love-affair which she hasn\u2019t taken just as seriously as if it were holy matrimony, with the same susceptibilities, the same quarrels, the same fidelity. By which token, those relations are often the most sincere; you\u2019ll find, in fact, more inconsolable lovers than husbands.\u201d \u201cYet, Oriane, if you take the case of your brother-in-law Palam\u00e8de you were speaking about just now; no mistress in the world could ever dream of being mourned as that poor Mme. de Charlus has been.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cYour Highness must permit me to be not altogether of her opinion. People don\u2019t all like to be mourned in the same way, each of us has his preferences.\u201d \u201cStill, he did make a regular cult of her after her death. It is true that people sometimes do for the dead what they would not have done for the living.\u201d \u201cFor one thing,\u201d retorted Mme. de Guermantes in a dreamy tone which belied her teasing purpose, \u201cwe go to their funerals, which we never do for the living!\u201d M. de Guermantes gave a sly glance at M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 as though to provoke him into laughter at the Duchess\u2019s wit. \u201cAt the same time I frankly admit,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cthat the manner in which I should like to be mourned by a man I loved would not be that adopted by my brother-in-law.\u201d The Duke\u2019s face darkened. He did not like to hear his wife utter rash judgments, especially about M. de Charlus. \u201cYou are very particular. His grief set an example to everyone,\u201d he reproved her stiffly. But the Duchess had in dealing with her husband that sort of boldness which animal tamers shew, or people who live with a madman and are not afraid of making him angry. \u201cOh, very well, just as you like \u2014 he does set an example, I never said he didn\u2019t, he goes every day to the cemetery to tell her how many people he has had to luncheon, he misses her enormously, but \u2014 as he\u2019d mourn for a cousin, a grandmother, a sister. It is not the grief of a husband. It is true that they were a pair of saints, which makes it all rather exceptional.\u201d M. de Guermantes, infuriated by his wife\u2019s chatter, fixed on her with a terrible immobility a pair of eyes already loaded. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to say anything against poor M\u00e9m\u00e9, who, by the way, could not come this evening,\u201d went on the Duchess, \u201cI quite admit there\u2019s no one like him, he\u2019s delightful; he has a delicacy, a warmth of heart that you don\u2019t as a rule find in men. He has a woman\u2019s heart, M\u00e9m\u00e9 has!\u201d \u201cWhat you say is absurd,\u201d M. de Guermantes broke in sharply. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing effeminate about M\u00e9m\u00e9, I know nobody so manly as he is.\u201d \u201cBut I am not suggesting that he\u2019s the least bit in the world effeminate. Do at least take the trouble to understand what I say,\u201d retorted the Duchess. \u201cHe\u2019s always like that the moment anyone mentions his brother,\u201d she added, turning to the Princesse de Parme. \u201cIt\u2019s very charming, it\u2019s a pleasure to hear him. There\u2019s nothing so nice as two brothers who are fond of each other,\u201d replied the Princess, as many a humbler person might have replied, for it is possible to belong to a princely race by birth and at the same time to be mentally affiliated to a race that is thoroughly plebeian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAs we\u2019re discussing your family, Oriane,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cI saw your nephew Saint-Loup yesterday; I believe he wants to ask you to do something for him.\u201d The Duc de Guermantes bent his Olympian brow. When he did not himself care to do a service, he preferred his wife not to assume the responsibility for it, knowing that it would come to the same thing in the end and that the people to whom the Duchess would be obliged to apply would put this concession down to the common account of the household, just as much as if it had been asked of them by the husband alone. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he tell me about it himself?\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cHe was here yesterday and stayed a couple of hours, and heaven only knows what a bore he managed to make himself. He would be no stupider than anyone else if he had only the sense, like many people we know, to be content with being a fool. It\u2019s his veneer of knowledge that\u2019s so terrible. He wants to preserve an open mind \u2014 open to all the things he doesn\u2019t understand. He talks to you about Morocco. It\u2019s appalling.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe can\u2019t go back there, because of Rachel,\u201d said the Prince de Foix \u201cSurely, now that they\u2019ve broken it off,\u201d interrupted M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. \u201cSo far from breaking it off, I found her a couple of days ago in Robert\u2019s rooms, they didn\u2019t look at all like people who\u2019d quarrelled, I can assure you,\u201d replied the Prince de Foix, who loved to spread abroad every rumour that could damage Robert\u2019s chances of marrying, and might for that matter have been misled by one of the intermittent resumptions of a connexion that was practically at an end\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat Rachel was speaking to me about you, I see her like that in the mornings, on the way to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es; she\u2019s a kind of head-in-air, as you say, what you call \u2018unlaced,\u2019 a sort of \u2018Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias,\u2019 only figuratively speaking, of course.\u201d This speech was addressed to me by Prince Von, who liked always to appear conversant with French literature and Parisian catchwords\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, that\u2019s just what it was \u2014 Morocco!\u201d exclaimed the Princess, flinging herself into this opening. \u201cWhat on earth can he want in Morocco?\u201d asked M. de Guermantes sternly; \u201cOriane can do absolutely nothing for him there, as he knows perfectly well.\u201d \u201cHe thinks he invented strategy,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes pursued the theme, \u201cand then he uses impossible words for the most trivial things, which doesn\u2019t prevent him from making blots all over his letters. The other day he announced that he\u2019d been given some sublime potatoes, and that he\u2019d taken a sublime stage box.\u201d \u201cHe speaks Latin,\u201d the Duke went one better. \u201cWhat! Latin?\u201d the Princesse gasped. \u201c\u2018Pon my soul he does! Ma\u2019am can ask Oriane if I\u2019m not telling the truth.\u201d \u201cWhy, of course, Ma\u2019am; the other day he said to us straight out, without stopping to think: \u2018I know of no more touching example of sic transit gloria mundi.\u2019 I can repeat the phrase now to your Highness because, after endless inquiries and by appealing to linguists, we succeeded in reconstructing it, but Robert flung it out without pausing for breath, one could hardly make out that there was Latin in it, he was just like a character in the Malade Imaginaire. And all this referred simply to the death of the Empress of Austria!\u201d \u201cPoor woman!\u201d cried the Princess, \u201cwhat a delicious creature she was.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201ca trifle mad, a trifle headstrong, but she was a thoroughly good woman, a nice, kind-hearted lunatic; the only thing I could never make out about her was why she had never managed to get her teeth made to fit her; they always came loose half-way through a sentence and she was obliged to stop short or she\u2019d have swallowed them.\u201d \u201cThat Rachel was speaking to me about you, she told me that young Saint-Loup worshipped you, that he was fonder of you than he was of her,\u201d said Prince Von to me, devouring his food like an ogre as he spoke, his face scarlet, his teeth bared by his perpetual grin. \u201cBut in that case she must be jealous of me and hate me,\u201d said I. \u201cNot at all, she told me all sorts of nice things about you. The Prince de Foix\u2019s mistress would perhaps be jealous if he preferred you to her. You don\u2019t understand? Come home with me, and I\u2019ll explain it all to you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t, I\u2019m going on to M. de Charlus at eleven.\u201d \u201cWhy, he sent round to me yesterday to ask me to dine with him this evening, but told me not to come after a quarter to eleven. But if you must go to him, at least come with me as far as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais, you will be in the periphery,\u201d said the Prince, who thought doubtless that this last word meant \u2018proximity\u2019 or possibly \u2018centre.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the bulging eyes in his coarse though handsome red face frightened me and I declined, saying that a friend was coming to call for me. This reply seemed to me in no way offensive. The Prince, however, apparently formed a different impression of it for he did not say another word to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI really must go and see the Queen of Naples; what a grief it must be to her,\u201d said (or at least appeared to me to have said) the Princesse de Parme. For her words had come to me only indistinctly through the intervening screen of those addressed to me, albeit in an undertone, by Prince Von, who had doubtless been afraid, if he spoke louder, of being overheard by the Prince de Foix. \u201cOh, dear, no!\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it has been any grief at all.\u201d \u201cNone at all! You do always fly to extremes so, Oriane,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, resuming his part of the cliff which by standing up to the wave forces it to fling higher its crest of foam. \u201cBasin knows even better than I that I\u2019m telling the truth,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cbut he thinks he\u2019s obliged to look severe because you are present, Ma\u2019am, and he\u2019s afraid of my shocking you.\u201d \u201cOh, please, no, I beg of you,\u201d cried the Princesse de Parme, dreading the slightest alteration on her account of these delicious Fridays at the Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019s, this forbidden fruit which the Queen of Sweden herself had not yet acquired the right to taste. \u201cWhy, it was Basin himself that she told, when he said to her with a duly sorrowful expression: \u2018But the Queen is in mourning; for whom, pray, is it a great grief to your Majesty?\u2019\u2014\u2018No, it\u2019s not a deep mourning, it\u2019s a light mourning, quite a light mourning, it\u2019s my sister.\u2019 The truth is, she\u2019s delighted about it, as Basin knows perfectly well, she invited us to a party that very evening, and gave me two pearls. I wish she could lose a sister every day! So far from weeping for her sister\u2019s death, she was in fits of laughter over it. She probably says to herself, like Robert, \u2018sic transit \u2014\u2014\u2019 I forget how it goes on,\u201d she added modestly, knowing how it went on perfectly well\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In saying all this Mme. de Guermantes was only being witty, and with complete insincerity, for the Queen of Naples, like the Duchesse d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, also doomed to a tragic fate, had the warmest heart in the world and mourned quite sincerely for her kinsfolk. Mme. de Guermantes knew those noble Bavarian sisters, her cousins, too well not to be aware of this. \u201cHe would like not to go back to Morocco,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, alighting hurriedly again upon the perch of Robert\u2019s name which had been held out to her, quite unintentionally, by Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cI believe you know General de Monserfeuil.\u201d \u201cVery slightly,\u201d replied the Duchess, who was an intimate friend of the officer in question. The Princess explained what it was that Saint-Loup wanted. \u201cGood gracious, yes, if I see him \u2014 it is possible that I may meet him,\u201d the Duchess replied, so as not to appear to be refusing, the occasions of her meeting General de Monserfeuil seeming to extend rapidly farther apart as soon as it became a question of her asking him for anything. This uncertainty did not, however, satisfy the Duke, who interrupted his wife: \u201cYou know perfectly well you won\u2019t seeing him, Oriane, and besides you have already asked him for two thing which he hasn\u2019t done. My wife has a passion for doing good turns to people,\u201d he went on, growing more and more furious, in order to force the Princess to withdraw her request, without there being any question made of his wife\u2019s good nature and so that Mme. de Parme should throw the blame back upon his own character, which was essentially obstructive. \u201cRobert could get anything he wanted out of Monserfeuil. Only, as he happens not to know himself what he wants, he gets us to ask for it because he knows there\u2019s no better way of making the whole thing fall through. Oriane has asked too many favours of Monserfeuil. A request from her now would be a reason for him to refuse.\u201d \u201cOh, in that case, it would be better if the Duchess did nothing,\u201d said Mme. de Parme\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cObviously!\u201d the Duke closed the discussion. \u201cPoor General, he\u2019s been defeated again at the elections,\u201d said the Princess, so as to turn the conversation from Robert. \u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing serious, it\u2019s only the seventh time,\u201d said the Duke, who, having been obliged himself to retire from politics, quite enjoyed hearing of other people\u2019s failures at the polls. \u201cHe has consoled himself by giving his wife another baby.\u201d \u201cWhat! Is that poor Mme. de Monserfeuil in an interesting condition again?\u201d cried the Princess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d replied the Duke, \u201cthat\u2019s the one division where the poor General has never failed to get in.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the period that followed I was continually to be invited, were it with a small party only, to these repasts at which I had at one time imagined the guests as seated like the Apostles in the Sainte-Chapelle. They did assemble there indeed, like the early Christians, not to partake merely of a material nourishment, which incidentally was exquisite, but in a sort of social Eucharist; so that in the course of a few dinner-parties I assimilated the acquaintance of all the friends of my hosts, friends to whom they presented me with a shade of benevolent patronage so marked (as a person for whom they had always had a sort of parental affection) that there was not one among them who would not have felt himself to be failing in his duty to the Duke and Duchess if he had given a ball without including my name on his list, and at the same time, while I sipped one of those Yquems which lay concealed in the Guermantes cellars, I tasted ortolans dressed according to each of the different recipes which the Duke himself used to elaborate and modified with prudence. However, for one who had already set his knees more than once beneath the mystic board, the consumption of the latter was not indispensable. Old friends of M. and Mme. de Guermantes came in to see them after dinner, \u2018with the tooth-picks,\u2019 as Mme. Swann would have said, without being expected, and took in winter a cup of tilleul in the lighted warmth of the great drawing-room, in summer a glass of orangeade in the darkness of the little rectangular strip of garden outside. There was no record of anything else, among the Guermantes, in these evenings in the garden, but orangeade. It had a sort of ritual meaning. To have added other refreshments would have seemed to be falsifying the tradition, just as a big at-home in the Faubourg Saint-Germain ceases to be an at-home if there is a play also, or music. You must be supposed to have come simply \u2014 though there be five hundred of you \u2014 to pay a call on, let us say, the Princesse de Guermantes. People marvelled at my influence because I was able to procure the addition to this orangeade of a jug containing the juice of stewed cherries or stewed pears. I took a dislike on this account to the Prince d\u2019Agrigente, who was like all the people who, lacking in imagination but not in covetousness, take a keen interest in what one is drinking and ask if they may taste a little of it themselves. Which meant that, every time, M. d\u2019Agrigente, by diminishing my ration, spoiled my pleasure. For this fruit juice can never be provided in sufficient quantities to quench one\u2019s thirst for it. Nothing is less cloying than these transpositions into flavour of the colour of a fruit which when cooked seems to have travelled backwards to the past season of its blossoming. Blushing like an orchard in spring, or, it may be, colourless and cool like the zephyr beneath the fruit-trees, the juice lets itself be breathed and gazed into one drop by drop, and M. d\u2019Agrigente prevented me, regularly, from taking my fill of it. Despite these distillations the traditional orangeade persisted like the tilleul. In these humble kinds, the social communion was none the less administered. In this respect, doubtless, the friends of M. and Mme. de Guermantes had, after all, as I had originally imagined, remained more different from the rest of humanity than their outward appearance might have misled me into supposing. Numbers of elderly men came to receive from the Duchess, together with the invariable drink, a welcome that was often far from cordial. Now this could not have been due to snobbishness, they themselves being of a rank to which there was none superior; nor to love of splendour; they did love it perhaps, but on less stringent social conditions might have been enjoying a glittering example of it, for on these same evenings the charming wife of a colossally rich financier would have given anything in the world to have them among the brilliant shooting-party she was giving for a couple of days for the King of Spain. They had nevertheless declined her invitation, and had come round without fail to inquire whether Mme. de Guermantes was at home. They were not even certain of finding there opinions that conformed entirely with their own, or sentiments of any great warmth; Mme. de Guermantes let fall now and then, on the Dreyfus case, on the Republic, the Laws against Religion, or even in an undertone on themselves, their weaknesses, the dullness of their conversation, comments which they had to appear not to notice. No doubt, if they kept up their habit of coming there, it was owing to their superfine training as epicures in things worldly, to their clear consciousness of the prime and perfect quality of the social dish, with its familiar, reassuring, sappy savour, free from blend or taint, with the origin and history of which they were as well aware as she who served them with it, remaining more \u2018noble\u2019 in this respect than they themselves imagined. Now, on this occasion, among the visitors to whom I was introduced after dinner, it so happened that there was that General de Monserfeuil of whom the Princesse de Parme had been speaking, while Mme. de Guermantes, of whose drawing-room he was one of the regular frequenters, had not known that he was going to be there that evening. He bowed before me, on hearing my name, as though I had been the President of the Supreme War Council. I had supposed it to be simply from some deep-rooted unwillingness to oblige, in which the Duke, as in wit if not in love, was his wife\u2019s accomplice, that the Duchess had practically refused to recommend her nephew to M. de Monserfeuil. And I saw in this an indifference all the more blameworthy in that I seemed to have gathered from a few words let fall by the Princess that Robert was in a post of danger from which it would be prudent to have him removed. But it was by the genuine malice of Mme. de Guermantes that I was revolted when, the Princesse de Parme having timidly suggested that she might say something herself and on her own responsibility to the General, the Duchess did everything in her power to dissuade her. \u201cBut Ma\u2019am,\u201d she cried, \u201cMonserfeuil has no sort of standing or influence whatever with the new Government. You would be wasting your breath.\u201d \u201cI think he can hear us,\u201d murmured the Princess, as a hint to the Duchess not to speak so loud. Without lowering her voice: \u201cYour Highness need not be afraid, he\u2019s as deaf as a post,\u201d said the Duchess, every word reaching the General distinctly. \u201cThe thing is, I believe M. de Saint-Loup is in a place that is not very safe,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cWhat is one to do?\u201d replied the Duchess. \u201cHe\u2019s in the same boat as everybody else, the only difference being that it was he who originally asked to be sent there. Besides, no, it\u2019s not really dangerous; if it was, you can imagine how anxious I should be to help. I, should have spoken to Saint-Joseph about it during dinner. He has far more influence, and he\u2019s a real worker. But, as you see, he\u2019s gone now. Still, asking him would be less awkward than going to this one, who has; three of his sons in Morocco just now and has refused to apply for them to be exchanged; he might raise that as an objection. Since your Highness insists on it, I shall speak to Saint-Joseph \u2014 if I see him again, or to Beautreillis. But if I don\u2019t see either of them, you mustn\u2019t waste your pity on Robert. It was explained to us the other day exactly where he is. I\u2019m sure he couldn\u2019t wish for a better place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a pretty flower, I\u2019ve never seen one like it; there\u2019s no one like you, Oriane, for having such marvellous things in your house,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme, who, fearing that General de Monserfeuil might have overheard the Duchess, sought now to change the conversation. I looked and recognised a plant of the sort that I had watched Elstir painting. \u201cI am so glad you like them; they are charming, do look at their little purple velvet collars; the only thing against them is \u2014 as may happen with people who are very pretty and very nicely dressed \u2014 they have a hideous name and a horrid smell. In spite of which I am very fond of them. But what is rather sad is that they are dying.\u201d \u201cBut they\u2019re growing in a pot, they aren\u2019t cut flowers,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cNo,\u201d answered the Duchess with a smile, \u201cbut it comes to the same thing, as they\u2019re all ladies. It\u2019s a kind of plant where the ladies and the gentlemen don\u2019t both grow on the same stalk. I\u2019m like people who keep a lady dog. I have to find a husband for my flowers. Otherwise I shan\u2019t have any young ones!\u201d \u201cHow very strange. Do you mean to say that in nature . . .?\u201d \u201cYes! There are certain insects whose duty it is to bring about the marriage, as they do with Sovereigns, by proxy, without the bride and bridegroom ever having set eyes on one another. And so, I assure you, I always tell my man to put my plant out in the window as often as possible, on the courtyard side and the garden side turn about, in the hope that the necessary insect will arrive. But the odds are too great. Fancy, he has first to have been seen by a person of the same species and the opposite sex, and he must then have taken it into his head to come and leave cards at the house. He hasn\u2019t appeared so far, I believe my plant can still qualify for the white flower of a blameless life, but I must say a little immodesty would please me better. It\u2019s just the same with that fine tree we have in the courtyard; he will die childless because he belongs to a kind that\u2019s very rare in these latitudes. In his case, it\u2019s the wind that\u2019s responsible for consummating the marriage, but the wall is a trifle high.\u201d \u201cBy Jove, yes,\u201d said M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, \u201cyou ought to take just a couple of inches off the top, that will be quite enough. There are certain operations one ought to know how to perform. The flavour of vanilla we tasted in the excellent ice you gave us this evening, Duchess, comes from a plant called the vanilla tree. This plant produces flowers which are both male and female, but a sort of solid wall set up between them prevents any communication. And so we could never get any fruit from them until a young Negro, a native of R\u00e9union, by the name of Albins, which by the way is rather an odd name for a black man since it means \u2018white,\u2019 had the happy thought of using the point of a needle to bring the separate organs into contact.\u201d \u201cBabal, you\u2019re divine, you know everything,\u201d cried the Duchess. \u201cBut you yourself, Oriane, have told me things I had no idea of,\u201d the Princesse de Parme assured her. \u201cI must explain to your Highness that it is Swann who has always talked to me all about botany. Sometimes when we were too bored to go to a tea-party or a concert we would set off for the country, and he would shew me extraordinary marriages between flowers, which was far more amusing than going to human marriages \u2014 no wedding-breakfast and no crowd in the sacristy. We never had time to go very far. Now that motor-cars have come in, it Would be delightful. Unfortunately, in the interval he himself has made an even more astonishing marriage, which makes everything very difficult. Oh, Ma\u2019am, life is a dreadful business, we spend our whole time doing things that bore us, and when by mere chance we come across somebody with whom we could go and look at something really interesting, he has to make a marriage like Swann\u2019s. Faced with the alternatives of giving up my botanical expeditions and being obliged to call upon a degrading person, I chose the former calamity. Besides, when it comes to that, there was no need to go quite so far. It seems that here, in my own little bit of garden, more odd things happen in broad daylight than at midnight \u2014 in the Bois de Boulogne! Only they attract no attention, because among flowers it\u2019s all done quite simply, you see a little orange shower, or else a very dusty fly coming to wipe its feet or take a bath before crawling into a flower. And that does the trick!\u201d \u201cThe cabinet the plant is standing on is splendid, too; it\u2019s Empire, I think,\u201d said the Princess, who, not being familiar with the works of Darwin and his followers, was unable to grasp the point of the Duchess\u2019s pleasantries. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m so glad Ma\u2019am likes it,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cit\u2019s a magnificent piece. I must tell you that I\u2019ve always adored the Empire style, even when it wasn\u2019t in fashion. I remember at Guermantes I got into terrible disgrace with my mother-in-law because I told them to bring down from the attics all the splendid Empire furniture Basin had inherited from the Montesquious, and used it to furnish the wing we lived in.\u201d M. de Guermantes smiled. He must nevertheless have remembered that the course of events had been totally different. But, the witticisms of the Princesse des Laumes at the expense of her mother-in-law\u2019s bad taste having been a tradition during the short time in which the Prince was in love with his wife, his love for the latter had been outlasted by a certain contempt for the intellectual inferiority of the former, a contempt which, however, went hand in hand with a considerable attachment and respect. \u201cThe I\u00e9nas have the same armchair with Wedgwood medallions, it\u2019s a lovely thing, but I prefer my own;\u201d said the Duchess, with the same air of impartiality as if she had been the possessor of neither of the articles under discussion. \u201cI know, of course, that they\u2019ve some marvellous things which I haven\u2019t got.\u201d The Princesse de Parme remained silent. \u201cBut it\u2019s quite true; your Highness hasn\u2019t seen their collection. Oh, you ought really to come there one day with me, it\u2019s one of the most magnificent things in Paris. You\u2019d say it was a museum come to life.\u201d And since this suggestion was one of the most \u2018Guermantes\u2019 of the Duchess\u2019s audacities, inasmuch as the l\u00e9nas were for the Princesse de Parme rank usurpers, their son bearing like her own the title of Duc de Guastalla, Mme. de Guermantes in thus launching it could not refrain (so far did the love that she bore for her own originality prevail over the deference due to the Princesse de Parme) from casting at her other guests a smiling glance of amusement. They too made an effort to smile, at once frightened, bewildered, and above all delighted to think that they were being ear-witnesses of Oriane\u2019s very \u2018latest\u2019 and could carry it away with them \u2018red hot.\u2019 They were only half shocked, knowing that the Duchess had the knack of strewing the ground with all the Courvoisier prejudices to achieve a vital success more thrilling and more enjoyable. Had she not, within the last few years, brought together Princesse Mathilde and that Due d\u2019Aumale who had written to the Princess\u2019s own brother the famous letter: \u201cIn my family all the men are brave and the women chaste\u201d? And inasmuch as Princes remain princely even at those moments when they appear anxious to forget that they are, the Due d\u2019Aumale and Princesse Mathilde had enjoyed themselves so greatly at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s that they had thereafter formed a defensive alliance, with that faculty for forgetting the past which Louis XVIII shewed when he took as his Minister Fouch\u00e9, who had voted the death of his brother. Mme. de Guermantes was now nourishing a similar project of arranging a meeting between Princesse Mur\u00e2t and the Queen of Naples. In the meantime, the Princesse de Parme appeared as embarrassed as might have been the heirs-apparent to the Thrones of the Netherlands and Belgium, styled respectively Prince of Orange and Duke of Brabant, had one offered to present to them M. de Mailly Nesle, Prince d\u2019Orange, and M. de Charlus, Due de Brabant. But, before anything further could happen, the Duchess, whom Swann and M. de Charlus between them (albeit the latter was resolute in ignoring the l\u00e9nas\u2019 existence) had with great difficulty succeeded in making admire the Empire style, exclaimed: \u201cHonestly, Ma\u2019am, I can\u2019t tell you how beautiful you will think it! I must confess that the Empire style has always had a fascination for me. But at the l\u00e9nas\u2019 it is really like a hallucination. That sort of \u2014 what shall I say \u2014 reflux from the Expedition to Egypt, and also the sweep forward into our own times from Antiquity, all those things that invade our houses, the Sphinxes that come to crouch at the feet of the sofas, the serpents coiled round candelabra, a huge Muse who holds out a little torch for you to play at bouillotte, or has quietly climbed on to the mantelpiece and is leaning against your clock; and then all the Pompeian lamps, the little boat-shaped beds which look as if they had been found floating on the Nile so that you expect to see Moses climb out of them, the classical chariots galloping along the bed tables. . . . \u201d \u201cThey\u2019re not very comfortable to sit in, those Empire chairs,\u201d the Princess ventured. \u201cNo,\u201d the Duchess agreed, \u201cbut,\u201d she at once added, insisting on the point with a smile: \u201cI like being uncomfortable on those mahogany seats covered with ruby velvet or green silk. I like that discomfort of the warrior who understands nothing but the curule chair and in the middle of his principal drawing-room crosses his fasces and piles his laurels. I can assure you that at the I\u00e9nas\u2019 one doesn\u2019t stop to think for a moment of how comfortable one is, when one sees in front of one a great strapping wench of a Victory painted in fresco on the wall. My husband is going to say that I\u2019m a very bad Royalist, but I\u2019m terribly disaffected, as you know, I can assure you that in those people\u2019s house one comes to love all the big N\u2019s and all the bees. Good gracious, after all for a good many years under our Kings we weren\u2019t exactly surfeited with glory, and so these warriors who brought home so many crowns that they stuck them even on the arms of the chairs, I must say I think it\u2019s all rather fetching! Your Highness ought really.\u201d \u201cWhy, my dear, if you think so,\u201d said the Princess, \u201cbut it seems to me that it won\u2019t be easy.\u201d \u201cBut Ma\u2019am will find that it will all go quite smoothly. They are very good people, and no fools. We took Mme. de Chevreuse there,\u201d added the Duchess, knowing the force of this example, \u201cshe was enchanted. The son is really very pleasant. I\u2019m going to say something that\u2019s not quite proper,\u201d she went on, \u201cbut he has a bedroom, and more especially a bed in it, in which I should love to sleep \u2014 without him! What is even less proper is that I went to see him once when he was ill and lying in it. By his side on the frame of the bed was moulded a long Siren, stretched out at full length, a lovely thing with a mother-of-pearl tail and some sort of lotus flowers in her hand. I assure you,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes, reducing the speed of her utterances to bring into even bolder relief the words which she had the air of modelling with the pout of her fine lips, drawing them out with her long expressive hands, directing on the Princess as she spoke a gentle, steady and searching gaze, \u201cthat with the palms and the golden crown at the side, it was most moving, it was just the arrangement of Gustave Moreau\u2019s Death and the Young Man (your Highness must know that great work, of course).\u201d The Princesse de Parme, who did not know so much as the painter\u2019s name, made violent movements with her head and smiled ardently, in order to manifest her admiration for his picture. But the intensity of her mimicry could not fill the place of that light which is absent from our eyes so long as we do not understand what people are trying to tell us. \u201cA good-looking boy, I believe?\u201d she asked. \u201cNo for he\u2019s just like a tapir. The eyes are a little those of a Queen Hortense on a screen. But he has probably come to the conclusion that it is rather absurd for a man to develop such a resemblance, and it is lost in the encaustic surface of his cheeks which give him really rather a Mameluke appearance. You feel that the polisher must call round every morning. Swann,\u201d she went on, reverting to the bed of the young Duke, \u201cwas struck by the resemblance between this Siren and Gustave Moreau\u2019s Death. But apart from that,\u201d she added, her speech becoming more rapid though still serious, so as to provoke more laughter, \u201cthere was nothing really that could strike us, for it was only a cold in the head, and the young man made a marvellous recovery.\u201d \u201cThey say he\u2019s a snob?\u201d put in M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, with a malicious twinkle, expecting to be answered with the same precision as though he had said: \u201cThey tell me that he has only four fingers on his right hand; is that so?\u201d \u201cG\u2014 ood g \u2014 racious, n \u2014 o,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes with a smile of benign indulgence. \u201cPerhaps just the least little bit of a snob in appearance, because he\u2019s extremely young, but I should be surprised to hear that he was really, for he\u2019s intelligent,\u201d she added, as though there were to her mind some absolute incompatibility between snobbishness and intelligence. \u201cHe has wit, too, I\u2019ve known him to be quite amusing,\u201d she said again, laughing with the air of an epicure and expert, as though the act of declaring that a person could be amusing demanded a certain expression of merriment from the speaker, or as though the Duc de Guastalla\u2019s sallies were recurring to her mind as she spoke. \u201cAnyway, as he never goes anywhere, he can\u2019t have much field for his snobbishness,\u201d she wound up, forgetting that this was hardly encouraging the Princesse de Parme to make overtures. \u201cI cannot help wondering what the Prince de Guermantes, who calls her Mme. I\u00e9na, will say if he hears that I\u2019ve been to see her.\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d cried the Duchess with extraordinary vivacity. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that it was we who gave up to Gilbert\u201d (she bitterly regretted that surrender now) \u201ca complete card-room done in the Empire style which came to us from Quiou-Quiou, and is an absolute marvel! There was no room for it here, though I think it would look better here than it does with him. It\u2019s a thing of sheer beauty, half Etruscan, half Egyptian. . . . \u201d \u201cEgyptian?\u201d queried the Princess, to whom the word Etruscan conveyed little. \u201cWell, really, you know, a little of both. Swann told us that, he explained it all to me, only you know I\u2019m such a dunce. But then, Ma\u2019am, what one has to bear in mind is that the Egypt of the Empire cabinetmakers has nothing to do with the historical Egypt, nor their Roman with the Romans nor their Etruria. . . . \u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d said the Princess. \u201cNo, it\u2019s like what they used to call a Louis XV costume under the Second Empire, when Anna de Monchy and dear Brigode\u2019s mother were girls. Basin was talking to you just now about Beethoven. We heard a thing of his played the other day which was really quite good, though a little stiff, with a Russian theme in it. It\u2019s pathetic to think that he believed it to be Russian. In the same way as the Chinese painters believed they were copying Bellini. Besides, even in the same country, whenever anybody begins to look at things in a way that is slightly novel, nine hundred and ninety-nine people out of a thousand are totally incapable of seeing what he puts before them. It takes at least forty years before they can manage to make it out.\u201d \u201cForty years!\u201d the Princess cried in alarm. \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d went on the Duchess, adding more and more to her words (which were practically my own, for I had just been expressing a similar idea to her), thanks to her way of pronouncing them, the equivalent of what on the printed page is called italics: \u201cit\u2019s like a sort of first isolated individual of a species which does not yet exist but is going to multiply in the future, an individual endowed with a kind of sense which the human race of his generation does not possess. I can hardly give myself as an instance because I, on the contrary, have always loved any interesting production from the very start, however novel it might be. But really, the other day I was with the Grand Duchess in the Louvre and we happened to pass before Manet\u2019s Olympia. Nowadays nobody is in the least surprised by it. It looks just like an Ingres! And yet, heaven only knows how many spears I\u2019ve had to break for that picture, which I don\u2019t altogether like but which is unquestionably the work of somebody.\u201d \u201cAnd is the Grand Duchess well?\u201d inquired the Princesse de Parme, to whom the Tsar\u2019s aunt was infinitely more familiar than Manet\u2019s model. \u201cYes; we talked about you. After all,\u201d she resumed, clinging to her idea, \u201cthe fact of the matter is, as my brother-in-law Palam\u00e8de always says, that one has between oneself and the rest of the world the barrier of a strange language. Though I admit that there\u2019s no one it\u2019s quite so true of as Gilbert. If it amuses you to go to the I\u00e9nas\u2019, you have far too much sense to let your actions be governed by what that poor fellow may think, who is a dear, innocent creature, but really lives in a different world. I feel myself nearer, more akin to my coachman, my horses even, than to a man who keeps on harking back to what people would have thought under Philip the Bold or Louis the Fat. Just fancy, when he goes for a walk in the country, he takes a stick to drive the peasants out of his way, quite in a friendly spirit, saying: \u2018Get on, clowns!\u2019 Really, I\u2019m just as much surprised when he speaks to me as if I heard myself addressed by one of the \u2018recumbents\u2019 on the old gothic tombs. It\u2019s all very well that animated gravestone\u2019s being my cousin; he frightens me, and the only idea that comes into my head is to let him stay in his Middle Ages. Apart from that, I quite admit that he\u2019s never assassinated anyone.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve just been seeing him at dinner at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s,\u201d said the General, but without either smiling at or endorsing the Duchess\u2019s pleasantries. \u201cWas M. de Norpois there?\u201d asked Prince Von, whose mind still ran on the Academy of Moral Sciences. \u201cWhy, yes;\u201d said the General. \u201cIn fact, he was talking about your Emperor.\u201d \u201cIt seems, the Emperor William is highly intelligent, but he does not care for Elstir\u2019s painting. Not that I\u2019m saying this against him,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cI quite share his point of view. Although Elstir has done a fine portrait of me. You don\u2019t know it? It\u2019s not in the least like me, but it\u2019s a remarkable piece of work. He is interesting while one\u2019s sitting to him. He has made me like a little old woman It\u2019s after the style of the Regents of the Hospital, by Hals. I expect you know those sublimities, to borrow my nephew\u2019s favourite expression,\u201d the Duchess turned to myself, gently flapping her fan of black feathers. More than erect on her chair, she flung her head nobly backwards, for, while always a great lady, she was a trifle inclined to play the great lady also. I said that I had been once to Amsterdam and The Hague, but that to avoid confusing my mind, as my time was limited, I had left out Haarlem. \u201cAh! The Hague! What a gallery!\u201d cried M. de Guermantes. I said to him that he had doubtless admired Vermeer\u2019s Street in Delft. But the Duke was less erudite than arrogant. Accordingly he contented himself with replying in a tone of sufficiency, as was his habit whenever anyone spoke to him of a picture in a gallery, or in the Salon, which he did not remember having seen. \u201cIf it\u2019s to be seen, I saw it!\u201d \u201cWhat? You\u2019ve been to Holland, and you never visited Haarlem!\u201d cried the Duchess. \u201cWhy, even if you had only a quarter of an hour to spend in the place, they\u2019re an extraordinary thing to have seen, those Halses. I don\u2019t mind saying that a person who only caught a passing glimpse of them from the top of a tramway-car without stopping, supposing they were hung out to view in the street, would open his eyes pretty wide.\u201d This utterance shocked me as indicating a misconception of the way in which artistic impressions are formed in our minds, and because it seemed to imply that our eye is in that case simply a recording machine which takes instantaneous photographs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes, rejoicing that she should be speaking to me with so competent a knowledge of the subjects that interested me, gazed at the illustrious bearing of his wife, listened to what she was saying about Franz Hals, and thought: \u201cShe rides rough-shod over everything! Our young friend can go home and say that he\u2019s had before his eyes a great lady of the old school, in the full sense of the word, the like of whom couldn\u2019t be found anywhere to-day.\u201d Thus I beheld the pair of them, withdrawn from that name Guermantes in which long ago I had imagined them leading an unimaginable life, now just like other men and other women, lingering, only, behind their contemporaries a little way, and that not evenly, as in so many households of the Faubourg, where the wife has had the good taste to stop at the golden, the husband the misfortune to come down to the pinchbeck age of history, she remaining still Louis XV while her partner is pompously Louis-Philippe. That Mme. de Guermantes should be like other women had been for me at first a disappointment; it was now, by a natural reaction and with all these good wines to help, almost a miracle. A Don John of Austria, an Isabella d\u2019Est\u00e9, situated for us in the world of names, have as little communication with the great pages of history as the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way had with the Guermantes. Isabella d\u2019Est\u00e9 was no doubt in reality a very minor Princess, similar to those who under Louis XIV obtained no special place at Court. But seeming to us to be of a unique and therefore incomparable essence, we cannot conceive of her as being any less in greatness, so that a supper-party with Louis XIV would appear to us only to be rather interesting, whereas with Isabella d\u2019Este we should find ourselves, were we to meet her, gazing with our own eyes on a supernatural heroine of romance. Well, after we have, in studying Isabella d\u2019Est\u00e9, in transplanting her patiently from this world of fairyland into that of history, established the fact that her life, her thought contained nothing of that mysterious strangeness which had been suggested to us by her name, once this disappointment is complete we feel a boundless gratitude to this Princess for having had, of Mantegna\u2019s paintings, a knowledge almost equal to that, hitherto despised by us and put, as Fran\u00e7oise would have said, lower than the dirt, of M. Lafenestre. After having scaled the inaccessible heights of the name Guermantes, on descending the inner slope of the life of the Duchess, I felt on finding there the names, familiar elsewhere, of Victor Hugo, Franz Hals and, I regret to say, Vibert, the same astonishment that an explorer, after having taken into account, to imagine the singularity of the native customs in some wild valley of Central America or Northern Africa, its geographical remoteness, the strangeness of its flora, feels on discovering, once he has made his way through a hedge of giant aloes or manchineels, inhabitants who (sometimes indeed among the ruins of a Roman theatre and beneath a column dedicated to Venus) are engaged in reading M\u00e9rope or Alzire. And similarly, so remote, so distinct from, so far superior to the educated women of the middle classes whom I had known, the similar culture by which Mme. de Guermantes had made herself, with no ulterior motive, to gratify no ambition, descend to the level of people whom she would never know, had the character \u2014 meritorious, almost touching by virtue of being wholly useless \u2014 of an erudition in Phoenician antiquities in a politician or a doctor. \u201cI might have shewn you a very fine one,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, still speaking of Hals, \u201cthe finest in existence, some people say, which was left to me by a German cousin. Unfortunately, it turned out to be \u2018enfeoffed\u2019 in the castle \u2014 you don\u2019t know the expression, nor I either,\u201d she added, with her fondness for making jokes (which made her, she thought, seem modern) at the expense of the old customs to which nevertheless she was unconsciously but keenly attached. \u201cI am glad you have seen my Elstirs, but, I must admit, I should have been a great deal more glad if I could have done you the honours of my Hals, this \u2018enfeoffed\u2019 picture.\u201d \u201cI know the one,\u201d said Prince Von, \u201cit\u2019s the Grand Duke of Hesse\u2019s Hals.\u201d \u201cQuite so; his brother married my sister,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, \u201cand his mother and Oriane\u2019s were first cousins as well.\u201d \u201cBut so far as M. Elstir is concerned,\u201d the Prince went on, \u201cI shall take the liberty of saying, without having any opinion of his work, which I do not know, that the hatred with which the Emperor pursues him ought not, it seems to me, to be counted against him. The Emperor is a man of marvellous intelligence.\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019ve met him at dinner twice, once at my aunt Sagan\u2019s and once at my aunt Radziwill\u2019s, and I must say I found him quite unusual. I didn\u2019t find him at all simple! But there is something amusing about him, something \u2018forced,\u2019\u201d she detached the word, \u201clike a green carnation, that is to say a thing that surprises me and docs not please me enormously, a thing it is surprising that anyone should have been able to create but which I feel would have been just as well uncreated. I trust I\u2019m not shocking you.\u201d \u201cThe Emperor is a man of astounding intelligence,\u201d resumed the Prince, \u201che is passionately fond of the arts he has for works of art a taste that is practically infallible, if a thing is good he spots it at once and takes a dislike to it. If he detests anything there can be no more doubt about it, the thing is excellent.\u201cEveryone smiled. \u201cYou set my mind at rest,\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cI should be inclined to compare the Emperor,\u201d went on the Prince, who, not knowing how to pronounce the word archaeologist (that is to say, as though it were spelt \u2018arkeologist\u2019), never missed an opportunity of using it, \u201cto an old archaeologist\u201d (but the Prince said \u2018arsheologist\u2019) \u201cwe have in Berlin. If you put him in front of a genuine Assyrian antique, he weeps. But if it is a modern sham, if it is not really old, he does not weep. And so, when they want to know whether an arsheological piece is really old, they take it to the old arsheologist. If he weeps, they buy the piece for the Museum. If his eyes remain dry, they send it back to the dealer, and prosecute him for fraud. Well, every time I dine at Potsdam, if the Emperor says to me, of a play: \u2018Prince, you must see that, it\u2019s a work of genius,\u2019 I make a note not to go to it; and when I hear him fulminating against an exhibition, I rush to see it at the first possible opportunity.\u201d \u201cNorpois is in favour of an Anglo-French understanding, isn\u2019t he?\u201d said M. de Guermantes. \u201cWhat use would that be to you?\u201d asked Prince Von, who could not endure the English, in a tone at once of irritation and cunning. \u201cThe English are so schtubid. I know, of course, that it would not be as soldiers that they would help you. But one can judge them, all the same, by the stupidity of their Generals. A friend of mine was talking the other day to Botha, you know, the Boer leader. He said to my friend: \u2018It\u2019s terrible, an army like that. I rather like the English, as a matter of fact, but just imagine that I, who am only a peasant, have beaten them in every battle. And in the last, when I gave way before a force twenty times the strength of my own, while I myself surrendered, because I had to, I managed to take two thousand prisoners! That was good enough, because I was only commanding an army of farmers, but if those poor fools ever have to stand up against a European army, one trembles to think what may happen to them!\u2019 Besides, you have only to see how their King, whom you know as well as I do, passes for a great man in England.\u201d I barely listened to these stories, stories of the kind that M. de Norpois used to tell my father; they supplied no food for my favourite train of thought; and besides, even had they possessed the elements which they lacked, they would have had to be of a very exciting quality for my inner life to awaken during those hours in which I dwelt in my skin, my well-brushed hair, my starched shirt-front, in which, that is to say, I could feel nothing of what constituted for me the pleasure of life. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t agree with you at all,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, who felt that the German Prince was wanting in tact, \u201cI find King Edward charming, so simple, and much cleverer than people think. And the Queen is, even now, the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen in the world.\u201d \u201cBut, Madame la Duchesse,\u201d said the Prince, who was losing his temper and did not see that he was giving offence, \u201cyou must admit that if the Prince of Wales had been an ordinary person there isn\u2019t a club that wouldn\u2019t have blackballed him, and nobody would have been willing to shake hands with him. The Queen is charming, exceedingly sweet and limited. But after all there is something shocking about a royal couple who are literally kept by their subjects, who get the big Jewish financiers to foot all the bills they ought to pay themselves, and create them Baronets in return. It\u2019s like the Prince of Bulgaria . . . \u201d \u201cHe\u2019s our cousin,\u201d put in the Duchess. \u201cHe\u2019s a clever fellow.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s mine, too, but we don\u2019t think him a good fellow on that account. No, it is us you ought to make friends with, it\u2019s the Emperor\u2019s dearest wish, but he insists on its coming from the heart. He says: \u2018What I want to see is a hand clasped in mine, not waving a hat in the air.\u2019 With that, you would be invincible. It would be more practical than the Anglo-French friendship M. de Norpois preaches.\u201d \u201cYou know him, of course,\u201d the Duchess said, turning to me, so as not to leave me out of the conversation. Remembering that M. de Norpois had said that I had once looked as though I wanted to kiss his hand, thinking that he had no doubt repeated this story to Mme. de Guermantes, and in any event could have spoken of me to her only with malice, since in spite of his friendship with my father he had not hesitated to make me appear so ridiculous, I did not do what a man of the world would have done. He would have said that he detested M. de Norpois, and had let him see it; he would have said this so as to give himself the appearance of being the deliberate cause of the Ambassador\u2019s slanders, which would then have been no more than lying and calculated reprisals. I said, on the other hand, that, to my great regret, I was afraid that M. de Norpois did not like me. \u201cYou are quite mistaken,\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201che likes you very much indeed. You can ask Basin, for if people give me the reputation of only saying nice things, he certainly doesn\u2019t. He will tell you that we have never heard Norpois speak about anyone so kindly as he spoke to us of you. And only the other day he was wanting to give you a fine post at the Ministry. As he knew that you were not very strong and couldn\u2019t accept it, he had the delicacy not to speak of his kind thought to your father, for whom he has an unbounded admiration.\u201d M. de Norpois was quite the last person whom I should have expected to do me any practical service. The truth was that, his being a mocking and indeed somewhat malicious spirit, those people who had let themselves be taken in as I had by his outward appearance of a Saint Louis delivering justice beneath an oak-tree, by the sounds, easily modulated to pity, that emerged from his somewhat too tuneful lips, believed in a deliberate betrayal when they learned of a slander uttered at their expense by a man who had always seemed to put his whole heart into his speech. These slanders were frequent enough with him. But that did not prevent him from feeling attractions, from praising the people he liked and taking pleasure in shewing that he could be of use to them. \u201cNot that I\u2019m in the least surprised at his appreciating you,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, \u201che\u2019s an intelligent man. And I can quite understand,\u201d she added, for the benefit of the rest of the party, making allusion to a purpose of marriage of which I had heard nothing, \u201cthat my aunt, who has long ceased to amuse him as an old mistress, may not seem of very much use to him as a young wife. Especially as I understand that even as a mistress she has ceased for years now to serve any practical purpose, she is more wrapped up in her devotions than anv thing else. Boaz-Norpois can say, in the words of Victor Hugo:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Voil\u00e0 longtemps que celle avec qui j\u2019ai dormi\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O Seigneur, a quitt\u00e9 ma couche pour la v\u00f4tre!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Really, my poor aunt is like the artists of the advanced guard who have stood out all their lives against the Academy, and in the end start a little academy of their own, or the unfrocked priests who get up a little private religion. They should either keep their frocks, or not stick to their profession. And who knows,\u201d went on the Duchess with a meditative air, \u201cit may be in preparation for her widowhood, there\u2019s nothing sadder than the weeds one\u2019s not entitled to wear.\u201d \u201cAh! If Mme. de Villeparisis were to become Mme. de Norpois, I really believe our cousin Gilbert would take to his bed,\u201d said General de Monserfeuil. \u201cThe Prince de Guermantes is a charming man, but he is, really, very much taken up with questions of birth and manners,\u201d said the Princesse de Parme. \u201cI went down to spend a few days with them in the country, when the Princess, unfortunately, was ill in bed. I was accompanied by Petite.\u201d (This was a nickname that was given to Mme. d\u2019Hunolstein because she was enormously stout.) \u201cThe Prince came to meet me at the foot of the steps, and pretended not to see Petite. We went up to the first floor, to the door into the reception rooms, and then, stepping back to make way for me, he said: \u2018Oh, how d\u2019ye do, Mme. d\u2019Hunolstein?\u2019 (he always calls her that now, since her separation) pretending to have caught sight of Petite for the first time, so as to shew her that he had not come down to receive her at the foot of the steps.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least. I don\u2019t need to tell you,\u201d said the Duke, who regarded himself as extremely modern, more contemptuous than anyone in the world of mere birth, and in fact a Republican, \u201cthat I have not many ideas in common with my cousin. Ma\u2019am can imagine that we are just about as much agreed on most subjects as day and night. But I must say that if my aunt were to marry Norpois, for once I should be of Gilbert\u2019s opinion. To be the daughter of Florimond de Guise, and then to make a marriage like that would be enough, as the saying is, to make a cat laugh; what more can I say?\u201d These last words, which the Duke uttered as a rule in the middle of a sentence, were here quite superfluous. But he felt a perpetual need to be saying them which made him postpone them to the end of a speech if he had found no place for them elsewhere. They were for him, among other things, almost a question of prosody. \u201cRemember, though,\u201d he added, \u201cthat the Norpois are gallant gentlemen with a good place, of a good stock.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen to me, Basin, it\u2019s really not worth your while to poke fun at Gilbert if you\u2019re going to speak the same language as he does,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, for whom the \u2018goodness\u2019 of a family, no less than that of a wine, consisted in its age. But, less frank than her cousin and more subtle than her husband, she made a point of never in her conversation playing false to the Guermantes spirit, and despised rank in her speech while ready to honour it by her actions. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you some sort of cousins?\u201d asked General de Monserfeuil. \u201cI seem to remember that Norpois married a La Rochefoucauld.\u201d \u201cNot in that way at all, she belonged to the branch of the Ducs de La Rochefoucauld, my grandmother came from the Ducs de Doudeauville. She was own grandmother to Edouard Coco, the wisest man in the family,\u201d replied the Duke, whose views of wisdom were somewhat superficial, \u201cand the two branches haven\u2019t intermarried since Louis XIV\u2019s time; the connexion would be rather distant.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, that\u2019s interesting; I never knew that,\u201d said the General. \u201cHowever,\u201d went on M. de Guermantes, \u201chis mother, I believe, was the sister of the Duc de Montmorency, and had originally been married to a La Tour d\u2019Auvergne. But as those Montmorencys are barely Montmorencys, while those La Tour d\u2019Auvergnes are not La Tour d\u2019Auvergnes at all, I cannot see that it gives him any very great position. He says \u2014 and this should be more to the point \u2014 that he\u2019s descended from Saintrailles, and as we ourselves are in a direct line of descent. . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was at Combray a Rue de Saintrailles, to which I had never given another thought. It led from the Rue de la Bretonnerie to the Rue de l\u2019Oiseau. And as Saintrailles, the companion of Joan of Arc, had, by marrying a Guermantes, brought into that family the County of Combray, his arms were quartered with those of Guermantes at the foot of one of the windows in Saint-Hilaire. I saw again a vision of dark sandstone steps, while a modulation of sound brought to my ears that name, Guermantes, in the forgotten tone in which I used to hear it long ago, so different from that in which it was used to signify the genial hosts with whom I was dining this evening. If the name, Duchesse de Guermantes, was for me a collective name, it was so not merely in history, by the accumulation of all the women who had successively borne it, but also in the course of my own short life, which had already seen, in this single Duchesse de Guermantes, so many different women superimpose themselves, each one vanishing as soon as the next had acquired sufficient consistency. Words do not change their meaning as much in centuries as names do for us in the space of a few years. Our memory and our heart are not large enough to be able to remain faithful. We have not room enough, in our mental field, to keep the dead there as well as the living. We are obliged to build over what has gone before and is brought to light only by a chance excavation, such as the name Saintrailles had just wrought in my mind. I felt that it would be useless to explain all this, and indeed a little while earlier I had lied by implication in not answering when M. de Guermantes said to me: \u201cYou don\u2019t know our old wheedler?\u201d Perhaps he was quite well aware that I did know him, and it was only from good breeding that he did not press the question\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes drew me out of my meditation. \u201cReally, I find all that sort of thing too deadly. Listen, it\u2019s not always as boring as this at my parties. I hope that you will soon come and dine again as a compensation, with no pedigrees next time,\u201d she murmured, incapable both of appreciating the kind of charm which I could find in her house and of having sufficient humility to be content to appeal to me only as a herbarium, filled with plants of another day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What Mme. de Guermantes believed to be disappointing my expectations was on the contrary what in the end \u2014 for the Duke and the General went on to discuss pedigrees now without stopping \u2014 saved my evening from becoming a complete disappointment. How could I have felt otherwise until now? Each of my fellow-guests at dinner, smothering the mysterious name under which I had only at a distance known and dreamed of them with a body and with a mind similar or inferior to those of all the people I knew, had given me the impression of flat vulgarity which the view on entering the Danish port of Elsinore would give to any passionate admirer of Hamlet. No doubt those geographical regions and that ancient past which put forest glades and gothic belfries into their names had in a certain measure formed their faces, their intellects and their prejudices, but survived in them only as does the cause in the effect, that is to say as a thing possible for the brain to extract but in no way perceptible to the imagination\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And these old-time prejudices restored in a flash to the friends of M. and Mme. de Guermantes their vanished poetry. Assuredly, the motions in the possession of nobles, which make of them the scholars, the etymologists of the language not of words but of names (and this, moreover, relatively only to the ignorant mass of the middle classes, for if at the same level of mediocrity a devout Catholic would be better able to stand questioning upon the details of the Liturgy than a free-thinker, on the other hand an anti-clerical archaeologist can often give points to his parish priest on everything connected even with the latter\u2019s own church), those notions, if we are going to confine ourselves to the truth, that is to say to the spirit, had not for these great gentlemen the charm that they would have had for a man of simple birth. They knew perhaps better than myself that the Duchesse de Guise was Princess of Cleves, of Orleans and of Porcien, and all the rest, but they had known, long before they knew all these names, the face of the Duchesse de Guise which thenceforward the names reflected back to them. I had begun with the fairy \u2014 were she fated shortly to perish \u2014 they with the woman\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In middle-class families one sometimes sees jealousies spring up if the younger sister is married before the elder. So the aristocratic world, Courvoisiers especially but Guermantes also, reduced its ennobled greatness to simple domestic superiorities, by a system of child\u2019s-play which I had me\u2019 originally (and this gave it for me its sole charm) in books. Is it not just as though Tallemant des R\u00e9aux were speaking of the Guermantes, and not of the Rohans, when he relates with evident satisfaction how M. de Gu\u00e9m\u00e9n\u00e9e cried to his brother: \u201cYou can come in here; this is not the Louvre!\u201d and said of the Chevalier de Rohan (because he was a natural son of the Duc de Clermont): \u201cAt any rate, he\u2019s a Prince.\u201d The only thing that distressed me in all this talk was to find that the absurd stories which were being circulated about the charming Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg found as much credence in this drawing-room as they had among Saint-Loup\u2019s friends. Plainly it was an epidemic that would not last longer than perhaps a year or two but had meanwhile infected everyone. People repeated the same old stories, or enriched them with others equally untrue. I gathered that the Princesse de Luxembourg herself, while apparently defending her nephew, supplied weapons for the assault. \u201cYou are wrong to stand up for him,\u201d M. de Guermantes told me, as Saint-Loup had told me before. \u201cWhy, without taking into consideration the opinion of our family, who are unanimous about him, you have only to talk to his servants, and they, after all, are the people who know him best. M. de Luxembourg gave his little Negro page to his nephew. The Negro came back in tears: \u2018Grand Duke beaten me; me no bad boy; Grand Duke naughty man,\u2019 it\u2019s really too much. And I can speak with some knowledge, he\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin.\u201d I cannot, by the way, say how many times in the course of this evening I heard the word \u2018cousin\u2019 used. On the one hand, M. de Guermantes, almost at every name that was mentioned, exclaimed: \u201cBut he\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin!\u201d with the sudden joy of a man who, lost in a forest, reads at the ends of a pair of arrows pointing in opposite directions on a metal plate, and followed by quite a low number of kilometres, the words: \u201cBelv\u00e9d\u00e8re Casimir-Perier\u201d and \u201cCroix du Grand-Veneur,\u201d and gathers from them that he is on the right road. On the other hand the word cousin was employed in a wholly different connexion (which was here the exception to the prevailing rule) by the Turkish Ambassadress, who had come in after dinner. Devoured by social ambition and endowed with a real power of assimilating knowledge, she would pick up with equal facility the story of the Retreat of the Ten Thousand or the details of sexual perversion among birds. It would have been impossible to \u2018stump\u2019 her on any of the most recent German publications, whether they dealt with political economy, mental aberrations, the various forms of onanism, or the philosophy of Epicurus. She was, incidentally, a dangerous person to listen to, for, perpetually in error, she would point out to you as being of the loosest morals women of irreproachable virtue, would put you on your guard against a gentleman whose intentions were perfectly honourable, and would tell you anecdotes of the sort that seem always to have come out of a book, not so much because they are serious as because they are so wildly improbable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was at this period little received in society. She had been going for some weeks now to the houses of women of real social brilliance, such as the Duchesse de Guermantes, but as a general rule had confined herself, of necessity, in the noblest families, to obscure scions whom the Guermantes had ceased to know. She hoped to give herself a really fashionable air by quoting the most historic names of the little-known people who were her friends. At once M. de Guermantes, thinking that she was referring to people who frequently dined at his table, quivered with joy at finding himself once more in sight of a landmark and shouted the rallying-cry: \u201cBut he\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin! I know him as well as I know my own name. He lives in the Rue Vaneau. His mother was Mlle. d\u2019Uz\u00e9s.\u201d The Ambassadress was obliged to admit that her specimen had been drawn from smaller game. She tried to connect her friends with those of M. de Guermantes by cutting across his track: \u201cI know quite well who\u2019 you mean. No, it\u2019s not those ones, they\u2019re cousins.\u201d But this cross-current launched by the unfortunate Ambassadress ran but a little way. For M. de Guermantes, losing interest, answered: \u201cOh, then I don\u2019t know who\u2019 you\u2019re talking about.\u201d The Ambassadress offered no reply, for if she never knew anyone nearer than the \u2018cousins\u2019 of those whom she ought to have known in person, very often these \u2018cousins\u2019 were not even related at all. Then from the lips of M. de Guermantes, would flow a fresh wave of \u201cBut she\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin!\u201d words which seemed to have for the Duke the same practical value as certain epithets, convenient to the Roman poets because they provided them with dactyls or spondees for their hexameters. At least the explosion of: \u201cBut she\u2019s Oriane\u2019s cousin!\u201d appeared to me quite natural when applied to the Princesse de Guermantes, who was indeed very closely related to the Duchess. The Ambassadress did not seem to care for this Princess. She said to me in an undertone: \u201cShe is stupid. No, she is not so beautiful as all that. That claim is usurped. Anyhow,\u201d she went on, with an air at once reflective, rejecting and decided, \u201cI find her most uncongenial.\u201d But often the cousinship extended a great deal further than this, Mme. de Guermantes making it a point of honour to address as \u2018Aunt\u2019 ladies with whom it would have been impossible to find her an ancestress in common without going back at least to Louis XV; just as, whenever the \u2018hardness\u2019 of the times brought it about that a multimillionairess married a prince whose great-great-grandfather had espoused, as had Oriane\u2019s also, a daughter of Louvois, one of the chief joys of the fair American was to be able, after a first visit to the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes, where she was, incidentally, more or less coldly received and hotly cross-examined, to say \u2018Aunt\u2019 to Mme. de Guermantes, who allowed her to do so with a maternal smile. But little did it concern me what birth meant for M. de Guermantes and M. de Monserfeuil; in the conversations which they held on the subject I sought only for a poetic pleasure. Without being conscious of it themselves, they procured me this pleasure as might a couple of labourers or sailors speaking of the soil or the tides, realities too little detached from their own lives for them to be capable of enjoying the beauty which personally I proceeded to extract from them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes rather than of a race it was of a particular fact, of a date that a name reminded me. Hearing M. de Guermantes recall that M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9\u2018s mother had been a Choiseul and his grandmother a Lucinge, I fancied I could see beneath the commonplace shirt with its plain pearl studs, bleeding still in two globes of crystal, those august relics, the hearts of Mme. de Praslin and of the Duc de Berri. Others were more voluptuous: the fine and flowing hair of Mme. de Tallien or Mme. de Sabran\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Better informed than his wife as to what their ancestors had been, M. de Guermantes found himself the possessor of memories which gave to his conversation a fine air of an ancient mansion stripped of its real treasures but still full of pictures, authentic, indifferent and majestic, which taken as a whole look remarkably well. The Prince d\u2019Agrigente having asked why Prince Von had said, in speaking of the Due d\u2019Aumale, \u2018my uncle,\u2019 M. de Guermantes had replied: \u201cBecause his mother\u2019s brother, the Duke of Wurttemberg, married a daughter of Louis-Philippe.\u201d At once I was lost in contemplation of a casket, such as Carpaccio or Memling used to paint, from its first panel in which the Princess, at the wedding festivities of her brother the Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, appeared wearing a plain garden dress to indicate her resentment at having seen the return, empty-handed, of the ambassadors who had been sent to sue on her behalf for the hand of the Prince of Syracuse, down to the last, in which she had just given birth to a son, the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg (the first cousin of the Prince whom I had met at dinner), in that castle called Fantaisie, one of those places which are as aristocratic as certain families. They, moreover, outlasting a single generation of men, see attached to themselves more than one historical personage. In this one, especially, survive side by side memories of the Margravine of Bayreuth, of this other somewhat fantastic Princess (the Duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans\u2019s sister), to whom it was said that the name of her husband\u2019s castle made a distinct appeal, of the King of Bavaria, and finally of Prince Von, to whom it was simply his own postal address, at which he had just asked the Duc de Guermantes to write to him, for he had succeeded to it, and let it only during the Wagner festivals, to the Prince de Polignac, another delightful \u2018fantasist.\u2019 When M. de Guermantes, to explain how he was related to Mme. d\u2019Arpajon, was obliged, going so far and so simply, to climb the chain formed by the joined hands of three or five ancestresses back to Marie-Louise or Colbert, it was still the same thing in each case; a great historical event appeared only in passing, masked, unnatural, reduced, in the name of a property, in the Christian names of a woman, so selected because she was the granddaughter of Louis-Philippe and Marie-Am\u00e9lie, considered no longer as King and Queen of the French, but merely in the extent to which in their capacity as grandparents they bequeathed a heritage. (We see for other reasons in a gazetteer of the works of Balzac, where the most illustrious personages figure only according to their connexion with the Com\u00e9die Humaine, Napoleon occupy a space considerably less than that allotted to Rastignac, and occupy that space solely because he once spoke to the young ladies of Cinq-Cygne.) Similarly the aristocracy, in its heavy structure, pierced with rare windows, admitting a scanty daylight, shewing the same incapacity to soar but also the same massive and blind force as the architecture of the romanesque age, embodies all our history, immures it, beetles over it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus the empty spaces of my memory were covered by degrees with names which in taking order, in composing themselves with relation to one another, in linking themselves to one another by an increasingly numerous connexion, resembled those finished works of art in which there is not one touch that is isolated, in which every part in turn receives from the rest a justification which it confers on them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Luxembourg\u2019s name having come up again in the course of the conversation, the Turkish Ambassadress told us how, the young bride\u2019s grandfather (he who had made that immense fortune out of flour and cereals) having invited M. de Luxembourg to luncheon, the latter had written to decline, putting on the envelope: \u201cM. So-and-So, Miller,\u201d to which the grandfather had replied: \u201cI am all the more disappointed that you were not able to come, my dear friend, because I should have been able to enjoy your society quite intimately, for we were quite an intimate party, just ourselves, and there would have been only the Miller, his Son, and you.\u201d This story was not merely utterly distasteful to me, who knew the impossibility of my dear M. de Nassau\u2019s writing to the grandfather of his wife (whose fortune, moreover, he was expecting to inherit) and addressing him as \u2018Miller\u2019; but furthermore its stupidity became glaring from the start, the word \u2018Miller\u2019 having obviously been dragged in only to lead up to the title of La Fontaine\u2019s fable. But there is in the Faubourg Saint-Germain a silliness so great, when it is aggravated by malice, that they decided that the letter had been sent and that the grandfather, as to whom at once everyone confidently declared that he was a remarkable man, had shewn a prettier wit than his grandson-in-law. The Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault tried to take advantage of this story to tell the one that I had heard in the caf\u00e9: \u201cEveryone had to lie down!\u201d\u2014 but scarcely had he begun, or reported M. de Luxembourg\u2019s pretension that in his wife\u2019s presence M. de Guermantes ought to stand up, when the Duchess stopped him with the protest: \u201cNo, he is very absurd, but not as bad as that.\u201d I was privately convinced that all these stories at the expense of M. de Luxembourg were equally untrue, and that whenever I found myself face to face with any of th reputed actors or spectators I should hear the same contradiction. I asked myself, nevertheless, whether the contradiction just uttered by Mme. de Guermantes had been inspired by regard for truth or by self-esteem. In either event the latter quality succumbed to malice, for she went on, with a laugh: \u201cNot that I haven\u2019t had my little fling at him too, for he invited me to luncheon, wishing to make me know the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, which is how he has the good taste to describe his wife when he\u2019s writing to his aunt. I sent a reply expressing my regret, and adding: As for the \u2018Grand Duchess of Luxembourg\u2019 (in inverted commas), tell her that if she is coming to see me I am at home every Thursday after five. I have even had another little fling. Happening to be at Luxembourg, I telephoned, asking him to ring me up. His Highness was going to luncheon, had just risen from luncheon, two hours went by and nothing happened; so then I employed another method: \u2018Will you tell the Comte de Nassau to come and speak to me?\u2019 Cut to the quick, he was at the instrument that very minute.\u201d Everyone laughed at the Duchess\u2019s story, and at other analogous, that is to say (I am convinced of it) equally untrue stories, for a man more intelligent, better, more refined, in a word more exquisite than this Luxembourg-Nassau I have never met. The sequel will shew that it was I who was in the right. I must admit that, in the midst of her onslaught, Mme. de Guermantes had still a kind word for him. \u201cHe was not always like that,\u201d she informed us. \u201cBefore he went off his head, like the man in the story-book who thinks he\u2019s become king, he was no fool, and indeed in the early days of his engagement he used to speak of it in really quite a nice way, as something he could never have dreamed of: \u2018It\u2019s just like a fairy-tale; I shall have to make my entry into Luxembourg in a fairy coach,\u2019 he said to his uncle d\u2019Ornessan, who answered \u2014 for you know it\u2019s not a very big place, Luxembourg: \u2018A fairy coach! I\u2019m afraid, my dear fellow, you\u2019d never get it in. I should suggest that you take a goat carriage.\u2019 Not only did this not annoy Nassau, but he was the first to tell us the story, and to laugh at it.\u201d \u201cOrnessan is a witty fellow, and he\u2019s every rea \u2014 son to be; his mother was a Montjeu. lie\u2019s in a very bad way now, poor Ornessan.\u201d This name had the magic virtue of interrupting the flow of stale witticisms which otherwise would have gone on for ever. In fact, M. de Guermantes had to explain that M. d\u2019Ornessan\u2019s great-grandmother had been the sister of Marie de Castille Montjeu, the wife of Timol\u00e9on de Lorraine, and consequently Oriane\u2019s aunt, with the result that the conversation drifted back to genealogies, while the idiot of a Turkish Ambassadress breathed in my ear: \u201cYou appear to be very much in the Duke\u2019s good books; have a care!\u201d and, on my demanding an explanation: \u201cI mean to say, you understand what I mean, he\u2019s a man to whom one could safely entrust one\u2019s daughter, but not one\u2019s son.\u201d Now if ever, on the contrary, a man existed who was passionately and exclusively a lover of women, it was certainly the Duc de Guermantes. The state of error, the falsehood fatuously believed to be the truth, were for the Ambassadress like a vital element out of which she could not move. \u201cHis brother M\u00e9m\u00e9, who is, as it happens, for other reasons altogether\u201d (he did not bow to her) \u201cprofoundly uncongenial to me, is genuinely distressed by the Duke\u2019s morals. So is their aunt Villeparisis. Ah, now, her I adore! There is a saint of a woman for you, the true type of the great ladies of the past. It\u2019s not only her actual virtue that\u2019s so wonderful but her restraint. She still says \u2018Monsieur\u2019 to the Ambassador Norpois whom she sees every day, and who, by the way, left an excellent impression behind him in Turkey.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not even reply to the Ambassadress, in order to listen to the genealogies. They were not all of them important. There came up indeed in the course of the conversation one of those unexpected alliances, which, M. de Guermantes informed me, was a misalliance, but not without charm, for, uniting under the July Monarchy the Duc de Guermantes and the Duc de Fezensac with the two irresistible daughters of an eminent navigator, it gave the two Duchesses the exciting novelty of a grace exotically middle-class, \u2018Louisphilippically\u2019 Indian. Or else, under Louis XIV, a Norpois had married the daughter of the Duc de Mortenart, whose illustrious title struck, in the remoteness of that epoch, the name \u2014 which I had found colourless and might have supposed to be modern \u2014 of Norpois, carving deeply upon it the beauty of an old medal. And in these cases, moreover, it was not only the less well-known name that benefited by the association; the other, grown commonplace by the fact of its lustre, struck me more forcibly in this novel and more obscure aspect, just as among the portraits painted by a brilliant colourist the most striking is sometimes one that is all in black. The sudden mobility with which all these names seemed to me to have been endowed, as they sprang to take their places by the side of others from which I should have supposed them to be remote, was due not to my ignorance alone; the country-dances which they were performing in my mind they had carried out no less spontaneously at those epochs in which a title, being always attached to a piece of land, used to follow it from one family to another, so much so that, for example, in the fine feudal structure that is the title of Duc de Nemours or Duc de Chevreuse, I was able to discover successively hidden, as in the hospitable abode of a hermit-crab, a Guise, a Prince of Savoy, an Orl\u00e9ans, a Luynes. Sometimes several remained in competition for a single shell: for the Principality of Orange the Royal House of the Netherlands and MM. de Mailly-Nesle for the Duchy of Brabant the Baron de Charlus and the Royal House of Belgium, various others for the titles of Prince of Naples, Duke of Parma Duke of Reggio. Sometimes it was the other way; the shell had been so\u2019 long uninhabited by proprietors long since dead that it had never occurred to me that this or that name of a country house could have been, at an epoch which after all was comparatively recent, the name of a family. And so, when M. de Guermantes replied to a question put to him by M. de Monserfeuil: \u201cNo, my cousin was a fanatical Royalist; she was the daughter of the Marquis de F\u00e9terne, who played a certain part in the Chouan rising,\u201d on seeing this name F\u00e9terne, which had been for me, since my stay at Balbec, the name of a country house, become, what I had never dreamed that it could possibly be, a family name, I felt the same astonishment as in reading a fairy-tale, where turrets and a terrace come to life and turn into men and women. In this sense of the words, we may say that history, even mere family history, gives life to the old stones of a house. There have been in Parisian society men who played as considerable a part in it, who were more sought after for their distinction or for their wit, who were equally well born as the Duc de Guermantes or the Duc de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle. They have now fallen into oblivion because, as they left no descendants, their name which we no longer hear sounds like a name unknown; at most, the name of a thing beneath which we never think to discover the name of any person, it survives in some country house, some remote village. The day is not distant when the traveller who, in the heart of Burgundy, stops in the little village of Charlus to look at its church, if he has not sufficient industry or is in too great a hurry to examine its tombstones, will go away ignorant that this name, Charlus, was that of a man who ranked with the highest in the land. This thought reminded me that it was time to go, and that while I was listening to M. de Guermantes talking pedigrees, the hour was approaching at which I had promised to call upon his brother. \u201cWho knows,\u201d I continued to muse, \u201cwhether one day Guermantes itself may not appear nothing more than a place-name, save to the archaeologists who, stopping by chance at Combray and standing beneath the window of Gilbert the Bad, have the patience to listen to the account given them by Theodore\u2019s successor or to read the Cure\u2019s guide?\u201d But so long as a great name is not extinct it keeps in the full light of day those men and women who bear it; and there can be no doubt that, to a certain extent, the interest which the illustriousness of these families gave them in my eyes lay in the fact that one can, starting from to-day, follow their ascending course, step by step, to a point far beyond the fourteenth century, recover the diaries and correspondence of all the forebears of M. de Charlus, of the Prince d\u2019Agrigente, of the Princesse de Parme, in a past in which an impenetrable night would cloak the origins of a middle-class family, and in which we make out, in the luminous backward projection of a name, the origin and persistence of certain nervous characteristics, certain vices, the disorders of one or another Guermantes. Almost identical pathologically with their namesakes of the present day, they excite from century to century the startled interest of their correspondents, whether these be anterior to the Princess Palatine and Mme. de Motteville, or subsequent to the Prince de Ligne\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, my historical curiosity was faint in comparison with my aesthetic pleasure. The names cited had the effect of disincarnating the Duchess\u2019s guests, whom, for all they might call themselves Prince d\u2019Agrigente or de Cystira, their mask of flesh and of a common intelligence or want of intelligence had transformed into ordinary mortals, so much so that I had made my landing on the ducal door-mat not as upon the threshold (as I had supposed) but as at the farthest confines of the enchanted world of names. The Prince d\u2019Agrigente himself, as soon as I heard that his mother had been a Damas, a granddaughter of the Duke of Modena, was delivered, as from an unstable chemical alloy, from the face and speech that prevented one from recognising him, and went to form with Damas and Modena, which themselves were only titles, a combination infinitely more seductive. Each name displaced by the attractions of another, with which I had never suspected it of having any affinity, left the unalterable position which it had occupied in my brain, where familiarity had dulled it, and, speeding to join the Mortemarts, the Stuarts or the Bourbons, traced with them branches of the most graceful design and an ever-changing colour. The name Guermantes itself received from all the beautiful names \u2014 extinct, and so all the more glowingly rekindled \u2014 with which I learned only now that it was connected, a new sense and purpose, purely poetical. At the most, at the extremity of each spray that burgeoned from the exalted stem, I could see it flower in some face of a wise king or illustrious princess, like the sire of Henri IV or the Duchesse de Longueville. But as these faces, different in this respect from those of the party around me, were not discoloured for me by any trace of physical experience or fashionable mediocrity, they remained, in their handsome outlines and rainbow iridescence, homogeneous with those names which at regular intervals, each of a different hue, detached themselves from the genealogical tree of Guermantes, and disturbed with no foreign or opaque matter the buds \u2014 pellucid, alternate, many-coloured \u2014 which (like, in the old Jesse windows, the ancestors of Jesus) blossomed on either side of the tree of glass\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Already I had made several attempts to slip away, on account, more than for any other reason, of the triviality which my presence at it imparted to the gathering, albeit it was one of those which I had long imagined as being so beautiful \u2014 as it would doubtless have been had there been no inconvenient witness present. At least my departure would permit the other guests, once the profane intruder was no longer among them, to constitute themselves at length into a secret conclave. They would be free to celebrate the mysteries for the celebration of which they had met together, for it could obviously not have been to talk of Franz Hals or of avarice, and to talk of them in the same way as people talk in middle-class society. They uttered nothing but trivialities, doubtless because I was in the room, and I felt with some compunction, on seeing all these pretty women kept apart, that I was preventing them by my presence from carrying on, in the most precious of its drawing-rooms, the mysterious life of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. But this departure which I was trying at every moment to effect, M. and Mme. de Guermantes carried the spirit of self-sacrifice so far as to postpone, by keeping me in the room. A more curious thing still, several of the ladies who had come hurrying, delighted, beautifully dressed, with constellations of jewels, to be present at a party which, through my fault only, differed in no essential point from those that are given elsewhere than in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, any more than one feels oneself at Balbec to be in a town that differs from what one\u2019s eyes are accustomed to see \u2014 several of these ladies retired not at all disappointed, as they had every reason to be, but thanking Mme. de Guermantes most effusively for the delightful evening which they had spent, as though on the other days, those on which I was not present, nothing more used to occur\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it really for the sake of dinners such as this that all these people dressed themselves up and refused to allow the penetration of middle-class women into their so exclusive drawing-rooms \u2014 for dinners such as this? The same, had I been absent? The suspicion flashed across my mind for a moment, but it was too absurd. Plain commonsense enabled me to brush it aside. And then, if I had adopted it, what would have been left of the name Guermantes, already so degraded since Combray?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It struck me that these flower-maidens were, to a strange extent, either ready to be pleased with another person or anxious to make that person pleased with them, for more than one of them, to whom I had not uttered, during the whole course of the evening, more than two or three casual remarks, the stupidity of which had left me blushing, made a point, before leaving the drawing-room, of coming to tell me, fastening on me her fine caressing eyes, straightening as she spoke the garland of orchids that followed the curve of her bosom, what an intense pleasure it had been to her to make my acquaintance, and to speak to me \u2014 a veiled allusion to an invitation to dinner \u2014 of her desire to \u2018arrange something\u2019 after she had \u2018fixed a day\u2019 with Mme. de Guermantes. None of these flower ladies left the room before the Princesse de Parme. The presence of that lady \u2014 one must never depart before Royalty \u2014 was one of the two reasons, neither of which I had guessed, for which the Duchess had insisted so strongly on my remaining. As soon as Mme. de Parme had risen, it was like a deliverance. Each of the ladies having made a genuflexion before the Princess, who raised her up from the ground, they received from her, in a kiss, and like a benediction which they had craved kneeling, the permission to ask for their cloaks and carriages. With the result that there followed, at the front door, a sort of stentorian recital of great names from the History of France. The Princesse de Parme had forbidden Mme. de Guermantes to accompany her downstairs to the hall for fear of her catching cold, and the Duke had added: \u201cThere, Oriane, since Ma\u2019am gives you leave, remember what the doctor told you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am sure the Princesse de Parme was most pleased to take dinner with you.\u201d I knew the formula. The Duke had come the whole way across the drawing-room in order to utter it before me with an obliging, concerned air, as though he were handing me a diploma or offering me a plateful of biscuits. And I guessed from the pleasure which he appeared to be feeling as he spoke, and which brought so sweet an expression momentarily into his face, that the effort which this represented for him was of the kind which he would continue to make to the very end of his life, like one of those honorific and easy posts which, even when paralytic, one is still allowed to retain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as I was about to leave, the lady in waiting reappeared in the drawing-room, having forgotten to take away some wonderful carnations, sent up from Guermantes, which the Duchess had presented to Mme. de Parme. The lady in waiting was somewhat flushed, one felt that she had just been receiving a scolding, for the Princess, so kind to everyone else, could not contain her impatience at the stupidity of her attendant. And so the latter picked up the flowers and ran quickly, but to preserve her air of ease and independence flung at me as she passed: \u201cThe Princess says I\u2019m keeping her waiting; she wants to be gone, and to have the carnations as well. Good lord! I\u2019m not a little bird, I can\u2019t be in two places at once.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas! the rule of not leaving before Royalty was not the only one. I could not depart at once, for there was another: this was that the famous lavishness, unknown to the Courvoisiers, with which the Guermantes, whether opulent or practically ruined, excelled in entertaining their friends, was not only a material lavishness, of the kind that I had often experienced with Robert de Saint-Loup, but also a lavish display of charming words, of courteous actions, a whole system of verbal elegance supplied from a positive treasure-house within. But as this last, in the inactivity of fashionable existence, must remain unemployed, it expanded at times, sought an outlet in a sort of fugitive effusion, all the more intense, which might, in Mme. de Guermantes, have led one to suppose a genuine affection for oneself. Which she did, for that matter, feel at the moment when she let it overflow, for she found then in the society of the friend, man or woman, with whom she happened to be a sort of intoxication, in no way sensual, similar to that which music produces in certain people; she would suddenly detach a flower from her bodice, or a medallion, and present it to someone with whom she would have liked to prolong the evening, with a melancholy feeling the while that such a prolongation could have led to nothing but idle talk, into which nothing could have passed of the nervous pleasure, the fleeting emotion, similar to the first warm days of spring in the impression they leave behind them of exhaustion and regret. As for the friend, it did not do for him to put too implicit a faith in the promises, more exhilarating than anything he had ever heard, tendered by these women who, because they feel with so much more force the sweetness of a moment, make of it, with a delicacy, a nobility of which normally constituted creatures are incapable, a compelling masterpiece of grace and goodness, and have no longer anything of themselves left to give when the next moment has arrived. Their affection does not outlive the exaltation that has dictated it; and the subtlety of mind which had then led them to divine all the things that you wished to hear and to say them to you will permit them just as easily, a few days later, to seize hold of your absurdities and use them to entertain another of their visitors with whom they will then be in the act of enjoying one of those \u2018musical moments\u2019 which are so brief\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the hall where I asked a footman for my snowboots which I had brought as a precaution against the snow, several flakes of which had already fallen, to be converted rapidly into slush, not having realised that they were hardly fashionable, I felt, at the contemptuous smile on all sides, a shame which rose to its highest pitch when I saw that Mme. de Parme had not gone and was watching me put on my American \u2018rubbers.\u2019 The Princess came towards me. \u201cOh! What a good idea,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cit\u2019s so practical! There\u2019s a sensible man for you. Madame, we shall have to get a pair of those,\u201d she went on to her lady in waiting, while the mockery of the footmen turned to respect and the other guests crowded round me to inquire where I had managed to find these marvels. \u201cWith those on, you will have nothing to fear even if it starts snowing again and you have a long way to go. You\u2019re independent of the weather,\u201d said the Princess to me. \u201cOh! If it comes to that, your Royal Highness can be reassured,\u201d broke in the lady in waiting with a knowing air, \u201cit will not snow again.\u201d \u201cWhat do you know about it, Madame?\u201d came witheringly from the excellent Princesse de Parme, who alone could succeed in piercing the thick skin of her lady in waiting. \u201cI can assure your Royal Highness, it cannot snow again. It is a physical impossibility.\u201d \u201cBut why?\u201d \u201cIt cannot snow any more, they have taken the necessary steps to prevent it, they have put down salt in the streets!\u201d The simple-minded lady did not observe either the anger of the Princess or the mirth of the rest of her audience, for instead of remaining silent she said to me with a genial smile, paying no heed to my repeated denials of any connexion with Admiral Jurien de la Gravi\u00e8re: \u201cNot that it matters, after all. This gentleman must have stout sea-legs. What\u2019s bred in the bone!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, having escorted the Princesse de Parme to her carriage, M. de Guermantes said to me, taking hold of my greatcoat: \u201cLet me help you into your skin.\u201d He had ceased even to smile when he employed this expression, for those that were most vulgar had for that very reason, because of the Guermantes affectation of simplicity, become aristocratic\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An exaltation that sank only into melancholy, because it was artificial, was what I also, although quite differently from Mme. de Guermantes, felt once I had finally left her house, in the carriage that was taking me to that of M. de Charlus. We can at pleasure abandon ourselves to one or other of two forces of which one rises in ourselves, emanates from our deepest impressions, the other comes to us from without. The first carries with it naturally a joy, the joy that springs from the life of the creator. The other current, that which endeavours to introduce into us the movement by which persons external to ourselves are stirred, is not accompanied by pleasure; but we can add a pleasure to it, by the shock of reaction, in an intoxication so feigned that it turns swiftly into boredom, into melancholy, whence the gloomy faces of so many men of fashion, and all those nervous conditions which may make them end in suicide. Well, in the carriage which was taking me to M. de Charlus, I was a prey to this second sort of exaltation, widely different from that which is given us by a personal impression, such as I had received in other carriages, once at Combray, in Dr. Percepied\u2019s gig, from which I had seen painted against the setting sun the spires of Martinville, another day at Balbec, in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s barouche, when I strove to identify the reminiscence that was suggested to me by an avenue of trees. But in this third carriage, what I had before my mind\u2019s eye were those conversations that had seemed to me so tedious at Mme. de Guermante\u2019s dinner-table, for example Prince Von\u2019s stories about the German Emperor, General Botha and the British Army. I had slipped them into the frame of the internal stereoscope through the lenses of which, once we are no longer ourselves, once, endowed with the spirit of society, we no longer wish to receive our life save from other people, we cast into relief what they have said and done. Like a tipsy man filled with tender feeling for the waiter who has been serving him, I marvelled at my good fortune, a good fortune not realised by me, it is true, at the actual moment, in having dined with a person who knew William II so well, and had told stories about him that were \u2014 upon my word \u2014 really witty. And, as I repeated to myself, with the Prince\u2019s German accent, the story of General Botha, I laughed out loud, as though this laugh, like certain kinds of applause which increase one\u2019s inward admiration, were necessary to the story as a corroboration of its comic element. Through the magnifying lenses even those of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s pronouncements which had struck me as being stupid (as for example that on the Hals pictures which one ought to see from the top of a tramway-car) took on a life, a depth that were extraordinary. And I must say that, even if this exaltation was quick to subside, it was not altogether unreasonable. Just as there may always come a day when we are glad to know the person whom we despise more than anyone in the world because he happens to be connected with a girl with whom we are in love, to whom he can introduce us, and thus offers us both utility and gratification, attributes in each of which we should have supposed him to be entirely lacking, so there is no conversation, any more than there are personal relations, from which we can be certain that we shall not one day derive some benefit. What Mme. de Guermantes had said to me about the pictures which it would be interesting to see, even from a tramway-car, was untrue, but it contained a germ of truth which was of value to me later on\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly the lines of Victor Hugo which I had heard her quote were, it must be admitted, of a period earlier than that in which he became something more than a new man, in which he brought to light, in the order of evolution, a literary species till then unknown, endowed with more complex organs than any then in existence. In these first poems, Victor Hugo is still a thinker, instead of contenting himself, like Nature, with supplying food for thought. His \u2018thoughts\u2019 he at that time expressed in the most direct form, almost in the sense in which the Duke employed the word when, feeling it to be out of date and a nuisance that the guests at his big parties at Guermantes should, in the visitors\u2019 book, append to their signatures a philosophico-poetical reflexion, he used to warn novices in an appealing tone: \u201cYour name, my dear fellow, but no \u2018thoughts\u2019 please!\u201d Well, it was these \u2018thoughts\u2019 of Victor Hugo (almost as entirely absent from the L\u00e9gende des Si\u00e8cles as \u2018airs,\u2019 as \u2018melodies\u2019 are from Wagner\u2019s later manner) that Mme. de Guermantes admired in the early Hugo. Nor was she altogether wrong. They were touching, and already round about them, without their form\u2019s having yet the depth which it was to acquire only in later years, the rolling tide of words and of richly articulated rhymes put them beyond comparison with the lines that one might discover in a Corneille, for example, lines in which a Romanticism that is intermittent, restrained and so all the more moving, nevertheless has not at all penetrated to the physical sources of life, modified the unconscious and generalisable organism in which the idea is latent. And so I had been wrong in confining myself, hitherto, to the later volumes of Hugo. Of the earlier, of course, it was only a fractional part that Mme. de Guermantes used to embellish her conversation. But simply by quoting in this way an isolated line one multiplies its power of attraction tenfold. The lines that had entered or returned to my mind during this dinner magnetised in turn, summoned to themselves with such force the poems in the heart of which they were normally embedded, that my magnetised hands could not hold out for longer than forty-eight hours against the force that drew them towards the volume in which were bound up the Orientales and the Chants du Cr\u00e9puscule. I cursed Franchise\u2019s footman for having made a present to his native village of my copy of the Feuilles d\u2019Automne, and sent him off, with not a moment to be lost, to procure me another. I read these volumes from cover to cover and found peace of mind only when I suddenly came across, awaiting me in the light in which she had bathed them, the lines that I had heard Mme. de Guermantes quote. For all these reasons, conversations with the Duchess resembled the discoveries that we make in the library of a country house, out of date, incomplete, incapable of forming a mind, lacking in almost everything that we value, but offering us now and then some curious scrap of information, for instance the quotation of a fine passage which we did not know and as to which we are glad to remember in after years that we owe our knowledge of it to a stately mansion of the great. We are then, by having found Balzac\u2019s preface to the Chartreuse, or some unpublished letters of Joubert, tempted to exaggerate the value of the life we led there, the sterile frivolity of which, for this windfall of a single evening, we forget\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From this point of view, if the fashionable world had been unable, at the first moment, to provide what my imagination expected, and must consequently strike me first of all by what it had in common with all the other worlds rather than by its difference, still it revealed itself to me by degrees as something quite distinct. Great noblemen are almost the only people of whom one learns as much as one does of peasants; their conversation is adorned with everything that concerns the land, houses, as people used to live in them long ago, old customs, everything of which the world of money is profoundly ignorant. Even supposing that the aristocrat most moderate in his aspirations has finally overtaken the period in which he lives, his mother, his uncles, his great-aunts keep him in touch, when he recalls his childhood, with the conditions of a life almost unknown today. In the death-chamber of a contemporary corpse Mme. de Guermantes would not have pointed out, but would immediately have perceived, all the lapses from the traditional customs. She was shocked to see at a funeral women mingling with the men, when there was a particular ceremony which ought to be celebrated for the women. As for the pall, the use of which Bloch would doubtless have believed to be confined to coffins, on account of the pall bearers of whom one reads in the reports of funerals, M. de Guermantes could remember the time when, as a child, he had seen it borne at the wedding of M. de Mailly-Nesle. While Saint-Loup had sold his priceless \u2018Genealogical Tree,\u2019 old portraits of the Bouillons, letters of Louis XIII, in order to buy Carri\u00e8res and furniture in the modern style, M. and Mme. de Guermantes, moved by a sentiment in which the burning love of art may have played only a minor part, and which left them themselves more insignificant than before, had kept their marvellous Boule furniture, which presented a picture attractive in a different way to an artist. A literary man would similarly have been enchanted by their conversation, which would have been for him \u2014 for one hungry man has no need of another to keep him company \u2014 a living dictionary of all those expressions which every day are becoming more and more forgotten: Saint-Joseph cravats, children dedicated to the Blue, and so forth, which one finds to-day only among those people who have constituted themselves the friendly and benevolent custodians of the past. The pleasure that a writer, more than among other writers, feels among them is not without danger, for there is a risk of his coming to believe that the things of the past have a charm in themselves, of his transferring them bodily into his work, still-born in that case, exhaling a tedium for which he consoles himself with the reflexion: \u201cIt is attractive because it\u2019s true; that is how people do talk.\u201d These aristocratic conversations had moreover the charm, with Mme. de Guermantes, of being couched in excellent French. For this reason they made permissible on the Duchess\u2019s part her hilarity at the words \u2018viaticum,\u2019 \u2018cosmic,\u2019 \u2018pythian,\u2019 \u2018pre-eminent,\u2019 which Saint-Loup used to employ \u2014 as, similarly, at his Bing furniture\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When all was said, very different in this respect from what I had been able to feel before the hawthorns, or when I tasted a crumb of madeleine, the stories that I had heard at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s remained alien to me. Entering for a moment into me, who was only physically possessed by them, one would have said that, being of a social, not an individual nature, they were impatient to escape. I writhed in my seat in the carriage like the priestess of an oracle. I looked forward to another dinner-party at which I might myself become a sort of Prince Von to Mme. de Guermantes, and repeat them. In the meantime they made my lips quiver as I stammered them to myself, and I tried in vain to bring back and concentrate a mind that was carried away by a centrifugal force. And so it was with a feverish impatience not to have to bear the whole weight of them any longer by myself in a carriage where, for that matter, I atoned for the lack of conversation by soliloquising aloud, that I rang the bell at M. de Charlus\u2019s door, and it was in long monologues with myself, in which I rehearsed everything that I was going to tell him and gave scarcely a thought to what he might have to say to me, that I spent the whole of the time during which I was kept waiting in a drawing-room into which a footman shewed me and where I was incidentally too much excited to look at what it contained. I felt so urgent a need that M. de Charlus should listen to the stories which I was burning to tell him that I was bitterly disappointed to think that the master of the house was perhaps in bed, and that I might have to go home to sleep off by myself my drunkenness of words. I had just noticed, in fact, that I had been twenty-five minutes \u2014 that they had perhaps forgotten about me \u2014 in this room of which, despite this long wait, I could at the most have said that it was very big, greenish in colour, and contained a large number of portraits. The need to speak prevents one not merely from listening but from seeing things, and in this case the absence of any description of my external surroundings is tantamount to a description of my internal state. I was preparing to leave the room to try to get hold of some one, and if I found no one to make my way back to the hall and have myself let out, when, just as I had risen from my chair and taken a few steps across the mosaic parquet of the floor, a manservant came in, with a troubled expression: \u201cMonsieur le Baron has been engaged all evening, Sir,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere are still several people waiting to see him. I am doing everything I possibly can to get him to receive you, I have already telephoned up twice to the secretary.\u201d \u201cNo; please don\u2019t bother. I had an appointment with M. le Baron, but it is very late already, and if he is busy this evening I can come back another day.\u201d \u201cOh no, Sir, you must not go away,\u201d cried the servant. \u201cM. le Baron might be vexed. I will try again.\u201d I was reminded of the things I had heard about M. de Charlus\u2019s servants and their devotion to their master. One could not quite say of him as of the Prince de Conti that he sought to give pleasure as much to the valet as to the Minister, but he had shewn such skill in making of the least thing that he asked of them a sort of personal favour that at night, when, his body-servants assembled round him at a respectful distance, after running his eye over them he said: \u201cCoignet, the candlestick!\u201d or \u201cDucret, the nightshirt!\u201d it was with an envious murmur that the rest used to withdraw, jealous of him who had been singled out by his master\u2019s favour. Two of them, indeed, who could not abide one another, used to try to snatch the favour each from his rival by going on the most flimsy pretext with a message to the Baron, if he had gone upstairs earlier than usual, in the hope of being invested for the evening with the charge of candlestick or nightshirt. If he addressed a few words directly to one of them on some subject outside the scope of his duty, still more if in winter, in the garden, knowing that one of his coachmen had caught cold, he said to him, after ten minutes: \u201cPut your cap on!\u201d the others would not speak to the fellow again for a fortnight, in their jealousy of the great distinction that had been conferred on him. I waited ten minutes more, and then, after requesting me not to stay too long as M. le Baron was tired and had had to send away several most important people who had made appointments with him many days before, they admitted me to his presence. This setting with which M. de Charlus surrounded himself seemed to me a great deal less impressive than the simplicity of his brother Guermantes, but already the door stood open, I could see the Baron, in a Chinese dressing-gown, with his throat bare, lying upon a sofa. My eye was caught at the same moment by a tall hat, its nap flashing like a mirror, which had been left on a chair with a cape, as though the Baron had but recently come in. The valet withdrew. I supposed that M. de Charlus would rise to greet me. Without moving a muscle he fixed on me a pair of implacable eyes. I went towards him, I said good evening; he did not hold out his hand, made no reply, did not ask me to take a chair. After a moment\u2019s silence I asked him, as one would ask an ill-mannered doctor, whether it was necessary for me to remain standing. I said this without any evil intention, but my words seemed only to intensify the cold fury on M. de Charlus\u2019s face. I was not aware, as it happened, that at home, in the country, at the Ch\u00e2teau de Charlus, he was in the habit, after dinner (so much did he love to play the king) of sprawling in an armchair in the smoking-room, letting hi3 guests remain standing round him. He would ask for a light from one, offer a cigar to another and then, after a few minutes\u2019 interval, would say: \u201cBut Argencourt, why don\u2019t you sit down? Take a chair, my dear fellow,\u201d and so forth, having made a point of keeping them standing simply to remind them that it was from himself that permission came to them to be seated. \u201cPut yourself in the Louis XIV seat,\u201d he answered me with an imperious air, as though rather to force me to move away farther from himself than to invite me to be seated. I took an armchair which was comparatively near. \u201cAh! so that is what you call a Louis XIV seat, is it? I can see you have been well educated,\u201d he cried in derision. I was so much taken aback that I did not move, either to leave the house, as I ought to have done, or to change my seat, as he wished. \u201cSir,\u201d he next said to me, weighing each of his words, to the more impertinent of which he prefixed a double yoke of consonants, \u201cthe interview which I have condescended to grant you at the request of a person who desires to be nameless, will mark the final point in our relations. I shall not conceal from you that I had hoped for better things! I should perhaps be forcing the sense of the words a little, which one ought not to do, even with people who are ignorant of their value, simply out of the respect due to oneself, were I to tell you that I had felt a certain attraction towards you. I think, however, that benevolence, in its most actively protecting sense, would exceed neither what I felt nor what I was proposing to display. I had, immediately on my return to Paris, given you to understand, while you were still at Balbec, that you could count upon me.\u201d I who remembered with what a torrent of abuse M. de Charlus had parted from me at Balbec made an instinctive gesture of contradiction. \u201cWhat!\u201d he cried with fury, and indeed his face, convulsed and white, differed as much from his ordinary face as does the sea when on a morning of storm one finds instead of its customary smiling surface a thousand serpents writhing in spray and foam, \u201cdo you mean to pretend that you did not receive my message \u2014 almost a declaration \u2014 that you were to remember me? What was there in the way of decoration round the cover of the book that I sent you?\u201d \u201cSome very pretty twined garlands with tooled ornaments,\u201d I told him. \u201cAh!\u201d he replied, with an air of scorn, \u201cthese young Frenchmen know little of the treasures of our land. What would be said of a young Berliner who had never heard of the Walk\u00fcre? Besides, you must have eyes to see and see not, since you yourself told me that you had stood for two hours in front of that particular treasure. I can see that you know no more about flowers than you do about styles; don\u2019t protest that you know about styles,\u201d he cried in a shrill scream of rage, \u201cyou can\u2019t even tell me what you are sitting on. You offer your hindquarters a Directorychauffeuse as a Louis XIV berg\u00e8re. One of these days you\u2019ll be mistaking Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s knees for the seat of the rear, and a fine mess you\u2019ll make of things then. It\u2019s precisely the same; you didn\u2019t even recognise on the binding of Bergotte\u2019s book the lintel of myosotis over the door of Balbec church. Could there be any clearer way of saying to you: \u2018Forget me not!\u2019?\u201d I looked at M. de Charlus. Undoubtedly his magnificent head, though repellent, yet far surpassed that of any of his relatives; you would have called him an Apollo grown old; but an olive-hued, bilious juice seemed ready to start from the corners of his evil mouth; as for intellect, one could not deny that his, over a vast compass, had taken in many things which must always remain unknown to his brother Guermantes. But whatever the fine words with which he coloured all his hatreds, one felt that, even if there was now an offended pride, now a disappointment in love, or a rancour, or sadism, a love of teasing, a fixed obsession, this man was capable of doing murder, and of proving by force of logic that he had been right in doin^ it and was still superior by a hundred cubits in moral stature to his brother, his sister-in-law, or any of the rest. \u201cJust as, in Velazquez\u2019sLances,\u201d he went on, \u201cthe victor advances towards him who is the humbler in rank, as is the duty of every noble nature, since I was everything and you were nothing, it was I who took the first steps towards you. You have made an idiotic reply to what it is not for me to describe as an act of greatness. But I have not allowed myself to be discouraged. Our religion inculcates patience. The patience I have shewn towards you will be counted, I hope, to my credit, and also my having only smiled at what might be denounced as impertinence, were it within your power to offer any impertinence to me who surpass you in stature by so many cubits; but after all, Sir, all this is now neither here nor there. I have subjected you to the test which the one eminent man of our world has ingeniously named the test of excessive friendliness, and which he rightly declares to be the most terrible of all, the only one that can separate the good grain from the tares. I could scarcely reproach you for having undergone it without success, for those who emerge from it triumphant are very few. But at least, and this is the conclusion which I am entitled to draw from the last words that we shall exchange on this earth, at least I intend to hear nothing more of your calumnious fabrications.\u201d So far, I had never dreamed that M. de Charlus\u2019s rage could have been caused by an unflattering remark which had been repeated to him; I searched my memory; I had not spoken about him to anyone. Some evil-doer had invented the whole thing. I protested to-M. de Charlus that I had said absolutely nothing about him. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can have annoyed you by saying to Mme. de Guermantes that I was a friend of yours.\u201d He gave a disdainful smile, made his voice climb to the supreme pitch of its highest register, and there, without strain, attacking the shrillest and most insolent note: \u201cOh! Sir,\u201d he said, returning by the most gradual stages to a natural intonation, and seeming to revel as he went in the oddities of this descending scale, \u201cI think that you are doing yourself an injustice when you accuse yourself of having said that we were friends. I do not look for any great verbal accuracy in anyone who could readily mistake a piece of Chippendale for a rococo chaire, but really I do not believe,\u201d he went on, with vocal caresses that grew more and more winning and brought to hover over his lips what was actually a charming smile, \u201cI do not believe that you can ever have said, or thought, that we were frlends! As for your having boasted that you had been presented to me, had talked to me, knew me slightly, had obtained, almost without solicitation, the prospect of coming one day under my protection, I find it on the contrary very natural and intelligent of you to have done so. The extreme difference in age that there is between us enables me to recognise without absurdity that thatpresentation, those talks, that vague prospect of future relations were for you, it is not for me to say an honour, but still, when all is said and done, an advantage as to which I consider that your folly lay not in divulging it but in not having had the sense to keep it. I will go so far as to say,\u201d he went on, passing abruptly for a moment from his arrogant wrath to a gentleness so tinged with melancholy that I expected him to burst into tears, \u201cthat when you left unanswered the proposal I made to you here in Paris it seemed to me so unheard-of an act on your part, coming from you who had struck me as well brought up and of a good bourgeois family,\u201d (on this adjective alone his voice sounded a little whistle of impertinence) \u201cthat I was foolish enough to imagine all the excuses that never really happen, letters miscarrying, addresses copied down wrong. I can see that on my part it was great foolishness, but Saint Bonaventure preferred to believe that an ox could fly rather than that his brother was capable of lying. Anyhow, that is all finished now, the idea did not attract you, there is no more to be said. It seems to me only that you might have brought yourself,\u201d (and there was a genuine sound of weeping in his voice) \u201cwere it only out of consideration for my age, to write to me. I had conceived and planned for you certain infinitely seductive things, which I had taken good care not to tell you. You have preferred to refuse without knowing what they were; that is your affair. But, as I tell you, one can always write. In your place, and indeed in my own, I should have done so. I like my place, for that reason, better than yours \u2014 I say \u2018for that reason\u2019 because I believe that we are all equal, and I have more fellow-feeling for an intelligent labourer than for many of our dukes. But I can say that I prefer my place to yours, because what you have done, in the whole course of my life, which is beginning now to be a pretty long one, I am conscious that I have never done.\u201d His head was turned away from the light, and I could not see if his eyes were dropping tears as I might have supposed from his voice. \u201cI told you that I had taken a hundred steps towards you; the only effect of that has been to make you retire two hundred from me. Now it is for me to withdraw, and we shall know one another no longer. I shall retain not your name but your story, so that at moments when I might be tempted to believe that men have good hearts, good manners, or simply the intelligence not to allow an unparalleled opportunity to escape them, I may remember that that is ranking them too highly. No, that you should have said that you knew me, when it was true \u2014 for henceforward it ceases to be true \u2014 I regard that as only natural, and I take it as an act of homage, that is to say something pleasant. Unfortunately, elsewhere and in other circumstances, you have uttered remarks of a very different nature.\u201d \u201cSir, I swear to you that I have said nothing that could insult you.\u201d \u201cAnd who says that I am insulted?\u201d he cried with fury, flinging himself into an erect posture on the seat on which hitherto he had been reclining motionless, while, as the pale frothing serpents stiffened in his face, his voice became alternately shrill and grave, like the deafening onrush of a storm. (The force with which he habitually spoke, which used to make strangers turn round in the street, was multiplied an hundredfold, as is a musical forte if, instead of being played on the piano, it is played by an orchestra, and changed into afortissimo as well. M. de Charlus roared.) \u201cDo you suppose that it is within your power to insult me? You evidently are not aware to whom you are speaking? Do you imagine that the envenomed spittle of five hundred little gentlemen of your type, heaped one upon another, would succeed in slobbering so much as the tips of my august toes?\u201d A moment before this my desire to persuade M. de Charlus that I had never said, nor heard anyone else say any evil of him had given place to a mad rage, caused by the words which were dictated to him solely, to my mind, by his colossal pride. Perhaps they were indeed the effect, in part at any rate, of this pride. Almost all the rest sprang from a feeling of which I was then still ignorant, and for which I could not therefore be blamed for not making due allowance. I could at least, failing this unknown element, have mingled with his pride, had I remembered the words of Mme. de Guermantes, a trace of madness. But at that moment the idea of madness never even entered my head. There was in him, according to me, only pride, in me there was only fury. This fury (at the moment when M. de Charlus ceased to shout, in order to refer to his august toes, with a majesty that was accompanied by a grimace, a nausea of disgust at his obscure blasphemers), this fury could contain itself no longer. With an impulsive movement, I wanted to strike something, and, a lingering trace of discernment making me respect the person of a man so much older than myself, and even, in view of their dignity as works of art, the pieces of German porcelain that were grouped around him, I flung myself upon the Baron\u2019s new silk hat, dashed it to the ground, trampled upon it, began blindly pulling it to pieces, wrenched off the brim, tore the crown in two, without heeding the vociferations of M. de Charlus, which continued to sound, and, crossing the room to leave it, opened the door. One on either side of it, to my intense stupefaction, stood two footmen, who moved slowly away, so as to appear only to have been casually passing in the course of their duty. (I afterwards learned their names; one was called Burnier, the other Charmel.) I was not taken in for a moment by this explanation which their leisurely gait seemed to offer me. It was highly improbable; three others appeared to me to be less so; one that the Baron sometimes entertained guests against whom, as he might happen to need assistance (but why?), he deemed it necessary to keep reinforcements posted close at hand. The second was that, drawn by curiosity, they had stopped to listen at the keyhole, not thinking that I should come out so quickly. The third, that, the whole of the scene which M. de Charlus had made with me having been prepared and acted, he had himself told them to listen, from a love of the spectacular combined, perhaps, with a \u2018nunc crudimini\u2018 from which each would derive a suitable profit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My anger had not calmed that of M. de Charlus, my departure from the room seemed to cause him acute distress; he called me back, made his servants call me back, and finally, forgetting that a moment earlier, when he spoke of his \u2018august toes,\u2019 he had thought to make me a witness of his own deification, came running after me at full speed, overtook me in the hall, and stood barring the door. \u201cThere, now,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t be childish; come back for a minute; he who loveth well chasteneth well, and if I have chastened you well it is because I love you well.\u201d My anger had subsided; I let the word \u2018chasten\u2019 pass, and followed the Baron, who, summoning a footman, ordered him without a trace of self-consciousness to clear away the remains of the shattered hat, which was replaced by another. \u201cIf you will tell me, Sir, who it is that has treacherously maligned me,\u201d I said to M. de Charlus, \u201cI will stay here to learn his name and to confute the impostor.\u201d \u201cWho? Do you not know? Do you retain no memory of the things you say? Do you think that the people who do me the service of informing me of those things do not begin by demanding secrecy? And do you imagine that I am going to betray a person to whom I have given my promise?\u201d \u201cSir, is it impossible then for you to tell me?\u201d I asked, racking my brains in a final effort to discover (and discovering no one) to whom I could have spoken about M. de Charlus. \u201cYou did not hear me say that I had given a promise of secrecy to my informant?\u201d he said in a snapping voice. \u201cI see that with your fondness for abject utterances you combine one for futile persistence. You ought to have at least the intelligence to profit by a final conversation, and so to speak as to say something that does not mean precisely nothing.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d I replied, moving away from him, \u201cyou insult me; I am unarmed, because you are several times my age, we are not equally matched; on the other hand, I cannot convince you; I have already sworn to you that I have said nothing.\u201d \u201cI am lying, then, am I?\u201d he cried in a terrifying tone, and with a bound forwards that brought him within a yard of myself. \u201cSome one has misinformed you.\u201d Then in a gentle, affectionate, melancholy voice, as in those symphonies which are played without any break between the different movements, in which a gracefulscherzo, amiable and idyllic, follows the thunder-peals of the opening pages: \u201cIt is quite possible,\u201d he told me. \u201cGenerally speaking, a remark repeated at second hand is rarely true. It is your fault if, not having profited by the opportunities of seeing me which I had held out to you, you have not furnished me, by that open speech of daily intercourse which creates confidence, with the unique and sovereign remedy against a spoken word which made you out a traitor. Either way, true or false, the remark has done its work. I can never again rid myself of the impression it made on me. I cannot even say that he who chasteneth well loveth well, for I have chastened you well enough but I no longer love you.\u201d While saying this he had forced me to sit down and had rung the bell. A different footman appeared. \u201cBring something to drink and order the brougham.\u201d I said that I was not thirsty and besides had a carriage waiting. \u201cThey have probably paid him and sent him away,\u201d he told me, \u201cyou needn\u2019t worry about that. I am ordering a carriage to take you home. . . . If you\u2019re anxious about the time . . . I could have given you a room here. . . . \u201d I said that my mother would be uneasy. \u201cAh! Of course, yes. Well, true or false, the remark has done its work. My affection, a trifle premature, had flowered too soon, and, like those apple trees of which you spoke so poetically at Balbec, it has been unable to withstand the first frost.\u201d If M. de Charlus\u2019s affection for me had not been destroyed, he could hardly have acted differently, since, while assuring me that we were no longer acquainted, he made me sit down, drink, asked me to stay the night, and was going now to send me home. He had indeed an air of dreading the moment at which he must part from me and find himself alone, that sort of slightly anxious fear which his sister-in-law and cousin Guermantes had appeared to me to be feeling when she had tried to force me to stay a little longer, with something of the same momentary fondness for myself, of the same effort to prolong the passing minute. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he went on, \u201cI have not the power to make blossom again what has once been destroyed. My affection for you is quite dead. Nothing can revive it. I believe that it is not unworthy of me to confess that I regret it. I always feel myself to be a little like Victor Hugo\u2019s Boaz: \u2018I am widowed and alone, and the darkness gathers o\u2019er me.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I passed again with him through the big green drawing-room. I told him, speaking quite at random, how beautiful I thought it. \u201cAin\u2019t it?\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing to be fond of something. The woodwork is Bagard. What is rather charming, d\u2019you see, is that it was made to match the Beauvais chairs and the consoles. You observe, it repeats the same decorative design. There used to be only two places where you could see this, the Louvre and M. d\u2019Hinnisdal\u2019s house. But naturally, as soon as I had decided to come and live in this street, there cropped up an old family house of the Chimays which nobody had ever seen before because it came here expressly for me. On the whole, it\u2019s good. It might perhaps be better, but after all it\u2019s not bad. Some pretty things, ain\u2019t there? These are portraits of my uncles, the King of Poland and the King of England, by Mignard. But why am I telling you all this? You must know it as well as I do, you were waiting in this room. No? Ah, then they must have put you in the blue drawing-room,\u201d he said with an air that might have been either impertinence, on the score of my want of interest, or personal superiority, in not having taken the trouble to ask where I had been kept waiting. \u201cLook now, in this cabinet I have all the hats worn by Mlle. Elisabeth, by the Princesse de Lamballe, and by the Queen. They don\u2019t interest you, one would think you couldn\u2019t see. Perhaps you are suffering from an affection of the optic nerve. If you like this kind of beauty better, here is a rainbow by Turner beginning to shine out between these two Rembrandts, as a sign of our reconciliation. You hear: Beethoven has come to join him.\u201d And indeed one could hear the first chords of the third part of the Pastoral Symphony, \u2018Joy after the Storm,\u2019 performed somewhere not far away, on the first landing no doubt, by a band of musicians. I innocently inquired how they happened to be playing that, and who the musicians were. \u201cAh, well, one doesn\u2019t know. One never does know. They are unseen music. Pretty, ain\u2019t it?\u201d he said to me in a slightly impertinent tone, which, nevertheless, suggested somehow the influence and accent of Swann. \u201cBut you care about as much for it as a fish does for little apples. You want to go home, regardless of any want of respect for Beethoven or for me. You are uttering your own judgment and condemnation,\u201d he added, with an affectionate and mournful air, when the moment had come for me to go. \u201cYou will excuse my not accompanying you home, as good manners ordain that I should,\u201d he said to me. \u201cSince I have decided not to see you again, spending five minutes more in your company would make very little difference to me. But I am tired, and I have a great deal to do.\u201d And then, seeing that it was a fine night: \u201cVery well, yes, I will come in the carriage, there is a superb moon which I shall go on to admire from the Bois after I have taken you home. What, you don\u2019t know how to shave; even on a night when you\u2019ve been dining out, you have still a few hairs here,\u201d he said, taking my chin between two fingers, so to speak magnetised, which after a moment\u2019s resistance ran up to my ears, like the fingers of a barber. \u201cAh! It would be pleasant to look at the \u2018blue light of the moon\u2019 in the Bois with some one like yourself,\u201d he said to me with a sudden and almost involuntary gentleness, then, in a sadder tone: \u201cFor you are nice, all the same; you could be nicer than anyone,\u201d he went on, laying his hand in a fatherly way on my shoulder. \u201cOriginally, I must say that I found you quite insignificant.\u201d I ought to have reflected that he must find me so still. I had only to recall the rage with which he had spoken to me, barely half an hour before. In spite of this I had the impression that he was, for the moment, sincere, that his kindness of heart was prevailing over what I regarded as an almost delirious condition of susceptibility and pride. The carriage was waiting beside us, and still he prolonged the conversation. \u201cCome along,\u201d he said abruptly, \u201cjump in, in five minutes we shall be at your door. And I shall bid you a good night which will cut short our relations, and for all time. It is better, since we must part for ever, that we should do so, as in music, on a perfect chord.\u201d Despite these solemn affirmations that we should never see one another again, I could have sworn that M. de Charlus, annoyed at having forgotten himself earlier in the evening and afraid of having hurt my feelings, would not have been displeased to see me once again. Nor was I mistaken, for, a moment later: \u201cThere, now,\u201d he said, \u201cif I hadn\u2019t forgotten the most important thing of all. In memory of your grandmother, I have had bound for you a curious edition of Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. That is what is going to prevent this from being our last meeting. One must console oneself with the reflexion that complicated affairs are rarely settled in a day. Just look how long they took over the Congress of Vienna.\u201d \u201cBut I could call for it without disturbing you,\u201d I said obligingly. \u201cWill you hold your tongue, you little fool,\u201d he replied with anger, \u201cand not give yourself a grotesque appearance of regarding as a small matter the honour of being probably (I do not say certainly, for it will perhaps be one of my servants who hands you the volumes) received by me.\u201d Then, regaining possession of himself: \u201cI do not wish to part from you on these words. No dissonance, before the eternal silence of the dominant.\u201d It was for his own nerves that he seemed to dread an immediate return home after harsh words of dissension. \u201cYou would not care to come to the Bois?\u201d he addressed me in a tone not so much interrogative as affirmative, and that not, as it seemed to me, because he did not wish to make me the offer but because he was afraid that his self-esteem might meet with a refusal. \u201cOh, very well,\u201d he went on, still postponing our separation, \u201cit is the moment when, as Whistler says, the bourgeois go to bed\u201d (perhaps he wished now to capture me by my self-esteem) \u201cand the right time to begin to look at things. But you don\u2019t even know who Whistler was!\u201d I changed the conversation and asked him whether the Princesse d\u2019I\u00e9na was an intelligent person. M. de Charlus stopped me, and, adopting the most contemptuous tone that I had yet heard him use, \u201cOh! There, Sir,\u201d he informed me, \u201cyou are alluding to an order of nomenclature with which I have no concern. There is perhaps an aristocracy among the Tahitians, but I must confess that I know nothing about it. The name which you have just mentioned, strangely enough, did sound in my ears only a few days ago. Some one asked me whether I would condescend to allow them to present to me the young Duc de Guastalla. The request astonished me, for the Duc de Guastalla has no need to get himself presented to me, for the simple reason that he is my cousin, and has known me all his life; he is the son of the Princesse de Parme, and, as a young kinsman of good upbringing, he never fails to come and pay his respects to me on New Year\u2019s Day. But, on making inquiries, I discovered that it was not my relative who was meant but the son of the person in whom you are interested. As there exists no Princess of that title, I supposed that my friend was referring to some poor wanton sleeping under the Pont d\u2019I\u00e9na, who had picturesquely assumed the title of Princesse d\u2019I\u00e9na, just as one talks about the Panther of the Batignolles, or the Steel King. But no, the reference was to a rich person who possesses some remarkable furniture which I had seen and admired at an exhibition, and which has this advantage over the name of its owner that it is genuine. As for this self-styled Duc de Guastalla, he, I supposed, must be my secretary\u2019s stockbroker; one can procure so many things with money. But no; it was the Emperor, it appears, who amused himself by conferring on these people a title which simply was not his to give. It was perhaps a sign of power, or of ignorance, or of malice; in any case, I consider, it was an exceedingly scurvy trick to play on these unconscious usurpers. But really, I cannot help you by throwing any light on the matter; my knowledge begins and ends with the Faubourg Saint-Germain, where, among all the Courvoisiers and Gallardons, you will find, if you can manage to secure an introduction, plenty of mangy old cats taken straight out of Balzac who will amuse you. Naturally, all that has nothing to do with the position of the Princesse de Guermantes, but without me and my \u2018Open, Sesame\u2019 her portals are unapproachable.\u201d \u201cIt is really very lovely, isn\u2019t it, Sir, the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s mansion?\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s not very lovely. It\u2019s the loveliest thing in the world. Next to the Princess herself, of course.\u201d \u201cThe Princesse de Guermantes is better than the Duchesse de Guermantes?\u201d \u201cOh! There\u2019s no comparison.\u201d (It is to be observed that, whenever people in society have the least touch of imagination, they will crown or dethrone, to suit their affections or their quarrels, those whose position appeared most solid and unalterably fixed.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Duchesse de Guermantes\u201d (possibly, in not calling her \u2018Oriane,\u2019 he wished to set a greater distance between her and myself) \u201cis delightful, far superior to anything you can have guessed. But, after all, she is incommensurable with her cousin. The Princess is exactly what the people in the Markets might imagine Princess Metternich to have been, but old Metternich believed she had started Wagner, because she knew Victor Maurel. The Princesse de Guermantes, or rather her mother, knew the man himself. Which is a distinction, not to mention the incredible beauty of the lady. And the Esther gardens alone!\u201d \u201cOne can\u2019t see them?\u201d \u201cNo, you would have to be invited, but they never invite anyone unless I intervene.\u201d But at once withdrawing, after casting it at me, the bait of this offer, he held out his hand, for we had reached my door. \u201cMy part is played, Sir, I will simply add these few words. Another person will perhaps some day offer you his affection, as I have done. Let the present example serve for your instruction. Do not neglect it. Affection is always precious. What one cannot do by oneself in this life, because there are things which one cannot ask, nor do, nor wish, nor learn by oneself, one can do in company, and without needing to be Thirteen, as in Balzac\u2019s story, or Four, as in The Three Musketeers. Good-bye.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He must have been feeling tired and have abandoned the idea of going to look at the moonlight, for he asked me to tell his coachman to drive home. At once he made a sharp movement as though he had changed his mind. But I had already given the order, and, so as not to lose any more time, went across now to ring the bell, without its entering my head that I had been meaning to tell M. de Charlus, about the German Emperor and General Botha, stories which had been an hour ago such an obsession but which his unexpected and crushing reception had sent flying far out of my mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On entering my room I saw on my desk a letter which Franchise\u2019s young footman had written to one of his friends and had left lying there. Now that my mother was away, there was no liberty which he had the least hesitation in taking; I was the more to blame of the two for taking that of reading the letter which, without an envelope, lay spread out before me and (which was my sole excuse) seemed to offer itself to my eye\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDear Friend and Cousin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope this finds you in good health, and the same with all the young folk, particularly my young godson Joseph whom I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting but whom I prefer to you all as being my godson, these relics of the heart they have their dust also, upon their blest remains let us not lay our hands. Besides dear friend and cousin who can say that to-morrow you and your dear wife my cousin Marie, will not both of you be cast headlong down into the bottom of the sea, like the sailor clinging to the mast on high, for this life is but a dark valley. Dear friend I must tell you that my principal occupation, which will astonish you I am certain, is now poetry which I love passionately, for one must somehow pass the time away. And so dear friend do not be too surprised if I have not answered your last letter before now, in place of pardon let oblivion come. As you are aware, Madame\u2019s mother has passed away amid unspeakable sufferings which fairly exhausted her as she saw as many as three doctors. The day of her interment was a great day for all Monsieur\u2019s relations came in crowds as well as several Ministers. It took them more than two hours to get to the cemetery, which will make you all open your eyes pretty wide in your village for they certainly won\u2019t do as much for mother Michu. So all my life to come can be but one long sob. I am amusing myself enormously with the motorcycle of which I have recently learned. What would you say, my dear friends, if I arrived suddenly like that at full speed at Les Ecorces. But on that head I shall no more keep silence for I feel that the frenzy of grief sweeps its reason away. I am associating with the Duchesse de Guermantes, people whose very names you have never heard in our ignorant villages. Therefore it is with pleasure that I am going to send the works of Racine, of Victor Hugo, of Pages Choisies de Chenedolle, of Alfred de Musset, for I would cure the land in which I saw the light of ignorance which leads unerringly to crime. I can think of nothing more to say to you and send you like the pelican wearied by a long flight my best regards as well as to your wife my godson and your sister Rose. May it never be said of her: And Rose she lived only as live the roses, as has been said by Victor Hugo, the sonnet of Arvers, Alfred de Musset, all those great geniuses who for that cause have had to die upon the blazing scaffold like Jeanne d\u2019Arc. Hoping for your next letter soon, receive my kisses like those of a brother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cP\u00e9rigot (Joseph).\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are attracted by every form of life which represents to us something unknown and strange, by a last illusion still unshattered. In spite of this, the mysterious utterances by means of which M. de Charlus had led me to imagine the Princesse de Guermantes as an extraordinary creature, different from anyone that I knew, were not sufficient to account for the stupefaction in which I was plunged, speedily followed by the fear that I might be the victim of some bad joke planned by some one who wanted to send me to the door of a house to which I had not been invited, when, about two months after my dinner with the Duchess and while she was at Cannes, having opened an envelope the appearance of which had not led me to suppose that it contained anything out of the common, I read the following words engraved on a card: \u201cThe Princesse de Guermantes,n\u00e9e Duchesse en Bavi\u00e8re, At Home, the \u2014\u2014-th.\u201d No doubt to be invited to the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s was perhaps not, from the social point of view, any more difficult than to dine with the Duchess, and my slight knowledge of heraldry had taught me that the title of Prince is not superior to that of Duke. Besides, I told myself that the intelligence of a society woman could not be essentially so heterogeneous to that of her congeners as M. de Charlus made out, nor so heterogeneous to that of any one other woman in society. But my imagination, like Elstir engaged upon rendering some effect of perspective without reference to a knowledge of the laws of nature which he might quite well possess, depicted for me not what I knew but what it saw; what it saw, that is to say what the name shewed it. Now, even before I had met the Duchess, the name Guermantes preceded by the title of Princess, like a note or a colour or quantity, profoundly modified from the surrounding values by the mathematical or aesthetic sign that governs it, had already suggested to me something entirely different. With that title one finds one\u2019s thoughts straying instinctively to the memoirs of the days of Louis XIII and Louis XIV, the English Court, the Queen of Scots, the Duchesse d\u2019Aumale; and I imagined the town house of the Princesse de Guermantes as more or less frequented by the Duchesse de Longueville and the great Cond\u00e9, whose presence there rendered it highly improbable that I should ever make my way into it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many of the things that M. de Charlus had told me had driven a vigorous spur into my imagination and, making it forget how much the reality had disappointed me at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s (people\u2019s names are in this respect like the names of places), had swung it towards Oriane\u2019s cousin. For that matter, M. de Charlus misled me at times as to the imaginary value and variety of people in society only because he was himself at times misled. And this, perhaps, because he did nothing, did not write, did not paint, did not even read anything in a serious and thorough manner. But, superior by several degrees to the people in society, if it was from them and the spectacle they afforded that he drew the material for his conversation, he was not for that reason understood by them. Speaking as an artist, he could at the most reveal the fallacious charm of people in society. But reveal it to artists alone, with relation to whom he might be said to play the part played by the reindeer among the Esquimaux. This precious animal plucks for them from the barren rocks lichens and mosses which they themselves could neither discover nor utilise, but which, once they have been digested by the reindeer, become for the inhabitants of the far North a nourishing form of food\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To which I may add that the pictures which M. de Charlus drew of society were animated with plenty of life by the blend of his ferocious hatreds and his passionate affections. Hatreds directed mainly against the young men, adoration aroused principally by certain women\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If among these the Princesse de Guermantes was placed by M. de Charlus upon the most exalted throne, his mysterious words about the \u2018unapproachable Aladdin\u2019s palace\u2019 in which his cousin dwelt were not sufficient to account for my stupefaction. Apart from whatever may be due to the divers subjective points of view, of which I shall have to speak later, in these artificial magnifications, the fact remains that there is a certain objective reality in each of these people, and consequently a difference among them. And how, when it comes to that, could it be otherwise? The humanity with which we consort and which bears so little resemblance to our dreams is, for all that, the same that, in the Memoirs, in the Letters of eminent persons, we have seen described and have felt a desire to know. The old man of complete insignificance whom we met at dinner is the same who wrote that proud letter, which (in a book on the War of 1870) we read with emotion, to Prince Friedrich-Karl. We are bored at a dinner-table because our imagination is absent, and because it is bearing us company we are interested in a book. But the people in question are the same. We should like to have known Mme. de Pompadour, who was so valuable a patron of the arts, and we should have been as much bored in her company as among the modern Egerias, at whose houses we cannot bring ourselves to pay a second call, so uninteresting do we find them. The fact remains, nevertheless, that these differences do exist. People are never exactly similar to one another, their mode of behaviour with regard to ourselves, at, one might say, the same level of friendship, reveals differences which, in the end, offer compensations. When I knew Mme. de Montmorency, she loved to say unpleasant things to me, but if I was in need of a service she would squander, in the hope of obtaining it for me effectively, all the credit at her disposal, without counting the cost. Whereas some other woman, Mme. de Guermantes for example, would never have wished to hurt my feelings, never said anything about me except what might give me pleasure, showered on me all those tokens of friendship which formed the rich manner of living, morally, of the Guermantes, but, had I asked her for the least thing above and beyond that, would not have moved an inch to procure it for me, as in those country houses where one has at one\u2019s disposal a motor-car and a special footman, but where it is impossible to obtain a glass of cider, for which no provision has been made in the arrangements for a party. Which was for me the true friend, Mme. de Montmorency, so glad always to annoy me and always so ready to oblige, or Mme. de Guermantes, distressed by the slightest offence that might have been given me and incapable of the slightest effort to be of use to me? The types of the human mind are so varied, so opposite, not only in literature but in society, that Baudelaire and M\u00e9rim\u00e9e are not the only people who have the right to despise one another mutually. These peculiarities continue to form in everyone a system of attitudes, of speech, of actions, so coherent, so despotic, that when we are in the presence of anyone his or her system seems to us superior to the rest. With Mme. de Guermantes, her words, deduced like a theorem from her type of mind, seemed to me the only ones that could possibly be said. And I was, at heart, of her opinion when she told me that Mme. de Montmorency was stupid and kept an open mind towards all the things she did not understand, or when, having heard of some spiteful remark by that lady, she said: \u201cThat is what you call a good woman; it is what I call a monster.\u201d But this tyranny of the reality which confronts us, this preponderance of the lamplight which turns the dawn \u2014 already distant \u2014 as pale as the faintest memory, disappeared when I was away from Mme. de Guermantes, and a different lady said to me, putting herself on my level and reckoning the Duchess as placed far below either of us: \u201cOriane takes no interest, really, in anything or anybody,\u201d or even (what in the presence of Mme. de Guermantes it would have seemed impossible to believe, so loudly did she herself proclaim the opposite): \u201cOriane is a snob.\u201d Seeing that no mathematical process would have enabled one to convert Mme. d\u2019Arpajon and Mme. de Montpensier into commensurable quantities, it would have been impossible for me to reply, had anyone asked me which of the two seemed to me superior to the other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, among the peculiar characteristics of the drawing-room of the Princesse de Guermantes, the one most generally quoted was a certain exclusiveness, due in part to the royal birth of the Princess, but especially to the almost fossilised rigidity of the aristocratic prejudices of the Prince, prejudices which, incidentally, the Duke and Duchess had made no scruple about deriding in front of me, and which naturally were to make me regard it as more improbable than ever that I should have been invited to a party by this man who reckoned only in royalties and dukes, and at every dinner-party made a scene because he had not been put in the place to which he would have been entitled under Louis XIV, a place which, thanks to his immense erudition in matters of history and genealogy, he was the only person who knew. For this reason, many of the people in society placed to the credit of the Duke and Duchess the differences which distinguished them from their cousins. \u201cThe Duke and Duchess are far more modern, far more intelligent, they don\u2019t think of nothing, like the other couple, but how many quarterings one has, their house is three hundred years in advance of their cousins\u2019,\u201d were customary remarks, the memory of which made me tremble as I looked at the card of invitation, to which they gave a far greater probability of its having been sent me by some practical joker\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Duke and Duchess had not been still at Cannes, I might have tried to find out from them whether the invitation which I had received was genuine. This state of doubt in which I was plunged was not due, as I flattered myself for a time by supposing, to a sentiment which a man of fashion would not have felt and which, consequently, a writer, even if he belonged apart from his writership to the fashionable caste, ought to reproduce in order to be thoroughly \u2018objective\u2019 and to depict each class differently. I happened, in fact, only the other day, in a charming volume of memoirs, to come upon the record of uncertainties analogous to those which the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s card made me undergo. \u201cGeorges and I\u201d (or \u201cH\u00e9ly and I,\u201d I have not the book at hand to verify the reference) \u201cwere so keen to be asked to Mme. Delessert\u2019s that, having received an invitation from her, we thought it prudent, each of us independently, to make certain that we were not the victims of an April fool.\u201d Now, the writer is none other than the Comte d\u2019Haussonville (he who married the Duc de Broglie\u2019s daughter) and the other young man who \u2018independently\u2019 makes sure that he is not having a practical joke played on him is, according to whether he is called Georges or H\u00e9ly, one or other of the two inseparable friends of M. d\u2019Haussonville, either M. d\u2019Harcourt or the Prince de Chalais\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The day on which the party was to be given at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s, I learned that the Duke and Duchess had just returned to Paris. The Princess\u2019s ball would not have brought them back, but one of their cousins was seriously ill, and moreover the Duke was greatly taken up with a revel which was to be held the same night, and at which he himself was to appear as Louis XI and his wife as Isabel of Bavaria. And I determined to go and see her that morning. But, having gone out early, they had not yet returned; I watched first of all from a little room, which had seemed to me to be a good look-out post, for the arrival of their carriage. As a matter of fact I had made a singularly bad choice in my observatory from which I could barely make out our courtyard, but I did see into several others, and this, though of no value to me, occupied my mind for a time. It is not only in Venice that one has those outlooks on to several houses at once which have proved so tempting to painters; it is just the same in Paris. Nor do I cite Venice at random. It is of its poorer quarters that certain poor quarters of Paris make one think, in the morning, with their tall, wide chimneys to which the sun imparts the most vivid pinks, the brightest reds; it is a whole garden that flowers above the houses, and flowers in such a variety of tints that one would call it, planted on top of the town, the garden of a tulip-fancier of Delft or Haarlem. And then also, the extreme proximity of the houses, with their windows looking opposite one another on to a common courtyard, makes of each casement the frame in which a cook sits dreamily gazing down at the ground below, in which farther off a girl is having her hair combed by an old woman with the face, barely distinguishable in the shadow, of a witch: thus each courtyard provides for the adjoining house, by suppressing all sound in its interval, by leaving visible a series of silent gestures in a series of rectangular frames, glazed by the closing of the windows, an exhibition of a hundred Dutch paintings hung in rows. Certainly from the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes one did not have the same kind of view, but one had curious views also, especially from the strange trigonometrical point at which I had placed myself and from which one\u2019s gaze was arrested by nothing nearer than the distant heights formed by the comparatively vague plots of ground which preceded, on a steep slope, the mansion of the Marquise de Plassac and Mme. de Tresmes, cousins (of the most noble category) of M. de Guermantes, whom I did not know. Between me and this house (which was that of their father, M. de Br\u00e9quigny) nothing but blocks of buildings of low elevation, facing in every conceivable direction, which, without blocking the view, increased the distance with their diagonal perspective. The red-tiled turret of the coach-house in which the Marquis de Fr\u00e9court kept his carriages did indeed end in a spire that rose rather higher, but was so slender that it concealed nothing, and made one think of those picturesque old buildings in Switzerland which spring up in isolation at the foot of a mountain. All these vague and divergent points on which my eyes rested made more distant apparently than if it had been separated from us by several streets or by a series of foothills the house of Mme. de Plassac, actually quite near but chimerically remote as in an Alpine landscape. When its large paned windows, glittering in the sunlight like flakes of rock crystal, were thrown open so as to air the rooms, one felt, in following from one floor to the next the footmen whom it was impossible to see clearly but who were visibly shaking carpets, the same pleasure as when one sees in a landscape by Turner or Elstir a traveller in a mail-coach, or a guide, at different degrees of altitude on the Saint-Gothard. But from this point of view in which I had ensconced myself I should have been in danger of not seeing M. or Mme. de Guermantes come in, so that when in the afternoon I was free to resume my survey I simply stood on the staircase, from which the opening of the carriage-gate could not escape my notice, and it was on this staircase that I posted myself, albeit there did not appear there, so entrancing with their footmen rendered minute by distance and busily cleaning, the Alpine beauties of the Br\u00e9quigny-Tresmes mansion. Now this wait on the staircase was to have for me consequences so considerable, and to reveal to me a picture no longer Turneresque but ethical, of so great importance, that it is preferable to postpone the account of it for a little while by interposing first that of my visit to the Guermantes when I knew that they had come home. It was the Duke alone who received me in the library. As I went in there came out a little man with snow-white hair, a look of poverty, a little black neckcloth such as was worn by the lawyer at Combray and by several of my grandfather\u2019s friends, but of a more timid aspect than they, who, making me a series of profound bows, refused absolutely to go downstairs until I had passed him. The Duke shouted after him from the library something which I did not understand, and the other responded with further bows, addressed to the wall, for the Duke could not see him, but endlessly repeated nevertheless, like the purposeless smiles on the faces of people who are talking to one over the telephone; he had a falsetto voice, and saluted me afresh with the humility of a man of business. And he might, for that matter, have been a man of business from Combray, so much was he in the style, provincial, out of date and mild, of the small folk, the modest elders of those parts. \u201cYou shall see Oriane in a minute,\u201d the Duke told me when I had entered the room. \u201cAs Swann is coming in presently and bringing her the proofs of his book on the coinage of the Order of Malta, and, what is worse, an immense photograph he has had taken shewing both sides of each of the coins, Oriane preferred to get dressed early so that she can stay with him until it\u2019s time to go out to dinner. We have such a heap of things in the house already that we don\u2019t know where to put them all, and I ask myself where on earth we are going to stick this photograph. But I have too good-natured a wife, who is too fond of giving people pleasure. She thought it would be polite to ask Swann to let her see side by side on one sheet the heads of all those Grand Masters of the Order whose medals he has found at Rhodes. I said Malta, didn\u2019t I, it is Rhodes, but it\u2019s all the same Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. As a matter of fact, she is interested in them only because Swann makes a hobby of it. Our family is very much mixed up in the whole story; even at the present day, my brother, whom you know, is one of the highest dignitaries in the Order of Malta. But I might have told all that to Oriane, she simply wouldn\u2019t have listened to me. On the other hand, it was quite enough that Swann\u2019s researches into the Templars (it\u2019s astonishing the passion that people of one religion have for studying others) should have led him on to the history of the Knights of Rhodes, who succeeded the Templars, for Oriane at once to insist on seeing the heads of these Knights. They were very small fry indeed compared with the Lusignans, Kings of Cyprus, from whom we descend in a direct line. But so far, as Swann hasn\u2019t taken them up, Oriane doesn\u2019t care to hear anything about the Lusignans.\u201d I could not at once explain to the Duke why I had come. What happened was that several relatives or friends, including Mme. de Silistrie and the Duchesse de Montrose, came to pay a call on the Duchess, who was often at home before dinner, and not finding her there stayed for a short while with the Duke. The first of these ladies (the Princesse de Silistrie), simply attired, with a dry but friendly manner, carried a stick in her hand. I was afraid at first that she had injured herself, or was a cripple. She was on the contrary most alert. She spoke regretfully to the Duke of a first cousin of his own \u2014 not on the Guermantes side, but more illustrious still, were that possible \u2014 whose health, which had been in a grave condition for some time past, had grown suddenly worse. But it was evident that the Duke, while full of pity for his cousin\u2019s lot, and repeating \u201cPoor Mama! He\u2019s such a good fellow!\u201d had formed a favourable prognosis. The fact was that the dinner at which the Duke was to be present amused him, the big party at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s did not bore him, but above all he was to go on at one o\u2019clock in the morning with his wife to a great supper and costume ball, with a view to which a costume of Louis XI for himself, and one of Isabel of Bavaria for his wife were waiting in readiness. And the Duke was determined not to be disturbed amid all these gaieties by the sufferings of the worthy Amanien d\u2019Osmond. Two other ladies carrying sticks, Mme. de Plassac and Mme. de Tresmes, both daughters of the Comte de Br\u00e9quigny, came in next to pay Basin a visit, and declared that cousin Mama\u2019s state left no room now for hope. The Duke shrugged his shoulders, and to change the conversation asked whether they were going that evening to Marie-Gilbert\u2019s. They replied that they were not, in view of the state of Amanien who was in his last agony, and indeed they had excused themselves from the dinner to which the Duke was going, the other guests at which they proceeded to enumerate: the brother of King Theodosius, the Infanta Maria Concepcion, and so forth. As the Marquis d\u2019Osmond was less nearly related to them than he was to Basin, their \u2018defection\u2019 appeared to the Duke to be a sort of indirect reproach aimed at his own conduct. And so, albeit they had come down from the heights of the Br\u00e9quigny mansion to see the Duchess (or rather to announce to her the alarming character, incompatible for his relatives with attendance at social gatherings, of their cousin\u2019s illness) they did not stay long, and, each armed with her alpenstock, Walpurge and Doroth\u00e9e (such were the names of the two sisters) retraced the craggy path to their citadel. I never thought of asking the Guermantes what was the meaning of these sticks, so common in a certain part of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Possibly, looking upon the whole parish as their domain, and not caring to hire cabs, they were in the habit of taking long walks, for which some old fracture, due to immoderate indulgence in the chase, and to the falls from horseback which are often the fruit of that indulgence, or simply rheumatism caused by the dampness of the left bank and of old country houses made a stick necessary. Perhaps they had not set out upon any such long expedition through the quarter, but, having merely come down into their garden (which lay at no distance from that of the Duchess) to pick the fruit required for stewing, had looked in on their way home to bid good evening to Mme. de Guermantes, though without going so far as to bring a pair of shears or a watering-can into her house. The Duke appeared touched that I should have come to see them so soon after their return to Paris. But his face grew dark when I told him that I had come to ask his wife to find out whether her cousin really had invited me. I had touched upon one of those services which M. and Mme. de Guermantes were not fond of rendering. The Duke explained to me that it was too late, that if the Princess had not sent me an invitation it would make him appear to be asking her for one, that his cousins had refused him one once before, and he had no wish to appear either directly or indirectly to be interfering with their visiting list, be \u2018meddling\u2019; finally, he could not even be sure that he and his wife, who were dining out that evening, would not come straight home afterwards, that in that case their best excuse for not having gone to the Princess\u2019s party would be to conceal from her the fact of their return to Paris, instead of hastening to inform her of it, as they must do if they sent her a note, or spoke to her over the telephone about me, and certainly too late to be of any use, since, in all probability, the Princess\u2019s list of guests would be closed by now. \u201cYou\u2019ve not fallen foul of her in any way?\u201d he asked in a suspicious tone, the Guermantes living in a constant fear of not being informed of the latest society quarrels, and so of people\u2019s trying to climb back into favour on their shoulders. Finally, as the Duke was in the habit of taking upon himself all decisions that might seem not very good-natured: \u201cListen, my boy,\u201d he said to me suddenly, as though the idea had just come into his head, \u201cI would really rather not mention at all to Oriane that you have been speaking to me about it. You know how kind-hearted she is; besides, she has an enormous regard for you, she would insist on sending to ask her cousin, in spite of anything I might say to the contrary, and if she is tired after dinner, there will be no getting out of it, she will be forced to go to the party. No, decidedly, I shall say nothing to her about it. Anyhow, you will see her yourself in a minute. But not a word about that matter, I beg of you. If you decide to go to the party, I have no need to tell you what a pleasure it will be to us to spend the evening there with you.\u201d The motives actuating humanity are too sacred for him before whom they are invoked not to bow to them, whether he believes them to be sincere or not; I did not wish to appear to be weighing in the balance for a moment the relative importance of my invitation and the possible tiredness of Mme. de Guermantes, and I promised not to speak to her of the object of my visit, exactly as though I had been taken in by the little farce which M. de Guermantes had performed for my benefit. I asked him if he thought there was any chance of my seeing Mme. de Stermaria at the Princess\u2019s. \u201cWhy, no,\u201d he replied with the air of an expert; \u201cI know the name you mention, from having seen it in lists of club members, it is not at all the type of person who goes to Gilbert\u2019s. You will see nobody there who is not excessively proper and intensely boring, duchesses bearing titles which one thought were extinct years ago and which they have revived for the occasion, all the Ambassadors, heaps of Coburgs, foreign royalties, but you mustn\u2019t hope for the ghost of a Stermaria. Gilbert would be taken ill at the mere thought of such a thing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWait now, you\u2019re fond of painting, I must shew you a superb picture I bought from my cousin, partly in exchange for the Elstirs, which frankly did not appeal to us. It was sold to me as a Philippe de Champaigne, but I believe myself that it\u2019s by some one even greater. Would you like to know my idea? I believe it to be a Velazquez, and of the best period,\u201d said the Duke, looking me boldly in the eyes, whether to learn my impression or in the hope of enhancing it. A footman came in. \u201cMme. la Duchesse has told me to ask M. le Duc if M. le Duc will be so good as to see M. Swann, as Mme. la Duchesse is not quite ready.\u201d \u201cShew M. Swann in,\u201d said the Duke, after looking at his watch and seeing that he had still a few minutes before he need go to dress. \u201cNaturally my wife, who told him to come, is not ready. There\u2019s no use saying anything before Swann about Marie-Gilbert\u2019s party,\u201d said the Duke. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he\u2019s been invited. Gilbert likes him immensely, because he believes him to be the natural grandson of the Duc de Berri, but that\u2019s a long story. (Otherwise, you can imagine! My cousin, who falls in a fit if he sees a Jew a mile off.) But now, don\u2019t you see, the Dreyfus case has made things more serious. Swann ought to have realised that he more than anyone must drop all connexion with those fellows, instead of which he says the most offensive things.\u201d The Duke called back the footman to know whether the man who had been sent to inquire at cousin Osmond\u2019s had returned. His plan was as follows: as he believed, and rightly, that his cousin was dying, he was anxious to obtain news of him before his death, that is to say before he was obliged to go into mourning. Once covered by the official certainty that Amanien was still alive, he could go without a thought to his dinner, to the Prince\u2019s party, to the midnight revel at which he would appear as Louis XI, and had made the most exciting assignation with a new mistress, and would make no more inquiries until the following day, when his pleasures would be at an end. Then one would put on mourning if the cousin had passed away in the night. \u201cNo, M. le Duc, he is not back yet.\u201d \u201cWhat in the Name of God! Nothing is ever done in this house till the last minute,\u201d cried the Duke, at the thought that Amanien might still be in time to \u2018croak\u2019 for an evening paper, and so make him miss his revel. He sent for the Temps, in which there was nothing. I had not seen Swann for a long time, and asked myself at first whether in the old days he used to clip his moustache, or had not his hair brushed up vertically in front, for I found in him something altered; it was simply that he was indeed greatly \u2018altered\u2019 because he was very ill, and illness produces in the face modifications as profound as are created by growing a beard or by changing the line of one\u2019s parting. (Swann\u2019s illness was the same that had killed his mother, who had been attacked by it at precisely the age which he had now reached. Our existences are in truth, owing to heredity, as full of cabalistic ciphers, of horoscopic castings as if there really were sorcerers in the world. And just as there is a certain duration of life for humanity in general, so there is one for families in particular, that is to say, in any one family, for the members of it who resemble one another.) Swann was dressed with an elegance which, like that of his wife, associated with what he now was what he once had been. Buttoned up in a pearl-grey frockcoat which emphasised the tallness of his figure, slender, his white gloves stitched in black, he carried a grey tall hat of a specially wide shape which Delion had ceased now to make except for him, the Prince de Sagan, the Marquis de Mod\u00e8ne, M. Charles Haas and Comte Louis de Turenne. I was surprised at the charming smile and affectionate handclasp with which he replied to my greeting, for I had imagined that after so long an interval he would not recognise me at once; I told him of my astonishment; he received it with a shout of laughter, a trace of indignation and a further grip of my hand, as if it were throwing doubt on the soundness of his brain or the sincerity of his affection to suppose that he did not know me. And yet that was what had happened; he did not identify me, as I learned long afterwards, until several minutes later when he heard my name mentioned. But no change in his face, in his .speech, in the things he said to me betrayed the discovery which a chance word from M. de Guermantes had enabled him to make, with such mastery, with such absolute sureness did he play the social game. He brought to it, moreover, that spontaneity in manners and personal initiative, even in his style of dress, which characterised the Guermantes type. Thus it was that the greeting which the old clubman, without recognising me, had given me was not the cold and stiff greeting of the man of the world who was a pure formalist, but a greeting full of a real friendliness, of a true charm, such as the Duchesse de Guermantes, for instance, possessed (carrying it so far as to smile at you first, before you had bowed to her, if she met you in the street), in contrast to the more mechanical greeting customary among the ladies of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. In the same way, again, the hat which, in conformity with a custom that was beginning to disappear, he laid on the floor by his feet, was lined with green leather, a thing not usually done, because, according to him, this kept the hat much cleaner, in reality because it was highly becoming. \u201cNow, Charles, you\u2019re a great expert, come and see what I\u2019ve got to shew you, after which, my boys, I\u2019m going to ask your permission to leave you together for a moment while I go and change my clothes, besides, I expect Oriane won\u2019t be long now.\u201d And he shewed his \u2018Velazquez\u2019 to Swann. \u201cBut it seems to me that I know this,\u201d said Swann with the grimace of a sick man for whom the mere act of speaking requires an effort. \u201cYes,\u201d said the Duke, turned serious by the time which the expert took in expressing his admiration. \u201cYou have probably seen it at Gilbert\u2019s.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, of course, I remember.\u201d \u201cWhat do you suppose it is?\u201d \u201cOh, well, if it cornes from Gilbert\u2019s, it is probably one of your ancestors,\u201d said Swann with a blend of irony and deference towards a form of greatness which he would have felt it impolite and absurd to despise, but to which for reasons of good taste he preferred to make only a playful reference\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo be sure, it is,\u201d said the Duke bluntly. \u201cIt\u2019s Boson, the I forget how manieth de Guermantes. Not that I care a damn about that. You know I\u2019m not as feudal as my cousin. I\u2019ve heard the names mentioned of Rigaud, Mignard, Velazquez even!\u201d he went on, fastening on Swann the gaze of an inquisitor and executioner in an attempt at once to read into his mind and to influence his response. \u201cWell,\u201d he concluded, for when he was led to provoke artificially an opinion which he desired to hear, he had the faculty, after a few moments, of believing that it had been spontaneously uttered; \u201ccome, now, none of your flattery, do you think it\u2019s by one of those big masters I\u2019ve mentioned?\u201d \u201cNnnnno,\u201d said Swann. \u201cBut after all, I know nothing about these things, it\u2019s not for me to decide who daubed the canvas. But you\u2019re a dilettante, a master of the subject, to whom do you attribute it? You\u2019re enough of an expert to have some idea. What would you put it down as?\u201d Swann hesitated for a moment before the picture, which obviously he thought atrocious. \u201cA bad joke!\u201d he replied with a smile at the Duke who could not check an impulsive movement of rage. When this had subsided: \u201cBe good fellows, both of you, wait a moment for Oriane, I must go and put on my swallow-tails and then I\u2019ll join you. I shall send word to my good woman that you\u2019re both waiting for her.\u201d I talked for a minute or two with Swann about the Dreyfus case, and asked him how it was that all the Guermantes were anti-Dreyfusards. \u201cIn the first place because at heart all these people are anti-Semites,\u201d replied Swann, who, all the same, knew very well from experience that certain of them were not, but, like everyone who supports any cause with ardour, preferred, to explain the fact that other people did not share his opinion, to suppose in them a preconceived reason, a prejudice against which there was nothing to be done, rather than reasons which might permit of discussion. Besides, having come to the premature term of his life, like a weary animal that is goaded on, he cried out against these persecutions and was returning to the spiritual fold of his fathers. \u201cYes, the Prince de Guermantes,\u201d I said, \u201cit is true, I\u2019ve heard that he was anti-semitic.\u201d \u201cOh, that fellow! I wasn\u2019t even thinking about him. He carries it to such a point that when he was in the army and had a frightful toothache he preferred to grin and bear it rather than go to the only dentist in the district, who happened to be a Jew, and later on he allowed a wing of his castle which had caught fire to be burned to the ground, because he would have had to send for extinguishers to the place next door, which belongs to the Rothschilds.\u201d \u201cAre you going to be there this evening, by any chance?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Swann replied, \u201calthough I am far too tired. But he sent me a wire to tell me that he has something to say to me. I feel that I shall be too unwell in the next few days to go there or to see him at home; it would upset me, so I prefer to get it over at once.\u201d \u201cBut the Duc de Guermantes is not anti-semitic?\u201d \u201cYou can see quite well that he is, since he\u2019s an anti-Dreyfusard,\u201d replied Swann, without noticing the logical fallacy. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t prevent my being very sorry that I disappointed the man \u2014 what am I saying? The Duke, I mean \u2014 by not admiring his Mignard or whatever he calls it.\u201d \u201cBut at any rate,\u201d I went on, reverting to the Dreyfus case, \u201cthe Duchess, she, now, is intelligent.\u201d \u201cYes, she is charming. To my mind, however, she was even more charming when she was still known as the Princesse des Laumes. Her mind has become somehow more angular, it was all much softer in the juvenile great lady, but after all, young or old, men or women, what can you expect, all these people belong to a different race, one can\u2019t have a thousand years of feudalism in one\u2019s blood with impunity. Naturally they imagine that it counts for nothing in their opinions.\u201d \u201cAll the same, Robert de Saint-Loup is a Dreyfusard.\u201d \u201cAh! So much the better, all the more as you know that his mother is extremely \u2018and.\u2019 I had heard that he was, but I wasn\u2019t certain of it. That gives me a great deal of pleasure. It doesn\u2019t surprise me, he\u2019s highly intelligent. It\u2019s a great thing, that is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dreyfusism had brought to Swann an extraordinary simplicity of mind and had imparted to his way of looking at things an impulsiveness, an inconsistency more noticeable even than had been the similar effects of his marriage to Odette; this new loss of caste would have been better described as a recasting, and was entirely to his credit, since it made him return to the ways in which his forebears had trodden and from which he had turned aside to mix with the aristocracy. But Swann, just at the very moment when with such lucidity it had been granted to him, thanks to the gifts he had inherited from his race, to perceive a truth that was still hidden from people of fashion, shewed himself nevertheless quite comically blind. He subjected afresh all his admirations and all his contempts to the test of a new criterion, Dreyfusism. That the anti-Dreyfusism of Mme. Bontemps should have made him think her a fool was no more astonishing than that, when he was first married, he should have thought her intelligent. It was not very serious either that the new wave reached also his political judgments and made him lose all memory of having treated as a man with a price, a British spy (this latter was an absurdity of the Guermantes set), Clemenceau, whom he declared now to have always stood up for conscience, to be a man of iron, like Comely. \u201cNo, no, I never told you anything of the sort. You\u2019re thinking of some one else.\u201d But, sweeping past his political judgments, the wave overthrew in Swann his literary judgments also, and even affected his way of pronouncing them. Barr\u00e9s had lost all his talent, and even the books of his early days were feeble, one could hardly read them again. \u201cYou try, you\u2019ll find you can\u2019t struggle to the end. What a difference from Clemenceau! Personally, I am not anticlerical, but when you compare them together you must see that Barr\u00e9s is invertebrate. He\u2019s a very great fellow, is old Clemenceau. How he knows the language!\u201d However, the anti-Dreyfusards were in no position to criticise these follies. They explained that one was a Dreyfusard by one\u2019s being of Jewish origin. If a practising Catholic like Saniette stood out also for a fresh trial, that was because he was buttonholed by Mme. Verdurin, who behaved like a wild Radical. She was out above all things against the \u2018frocks.\u2019 Saniette was more fool than knave, and had no idea of the harm that the Mistress was doing him. If you pointed out that Brichot was equally a friend of Mme. Verdurin and was a member of the Patrie Fran\u00e7aise, that was because he was more intelligent. \u201cYou see him occasionally?\u201d I asked Swann, referring to Saint-Loup. \u201cNo, never. He wrote to me the other day hoping that I would ask the Duc de Mouchy and various other people to vote for him at the Jockey, where for that matter he got through like a letter through the post.\u201d \u201cIn spite of the Case!\u201d \u201cThe question was never raised. However I must tell you that since all this business began I never set foot in the place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes returned, and was presently joined by his wife, all ready now for the evening, tall and proud in a gown of red satin the skirt of which was bordered with spangles. She had in her hair a long ostrich feather dyed purple, and over her shoulders a tulle scarf of the same red as her dress. \u201cHow nice it is to have one\u2019s hat lined with leather,\u201d said the Duchess, whom nothing escaped. \u201cHowever, with you, Charles, everything is always charming, whether it\u2019s what you wear or what you say what you read or what you do.\u201d Swann meanwhile, without apparently listening, was considering the Duchess as he would have studied the canvas of a master, and then sought her gaze, making with his lips the grimace which implies: \u2018The devil!\u2019 Mme. de Guermantes rippled with laughter. \u201cSo my clothes please you? I\u2019m delighted. But I must say that they don\u2019t please me much,\u201d she went on with a sulking air. \u201cGood Lord, what a bore it is to have to dress up and go out when one would ever so much rather stay at home!\u201d \u201cWhat magnificent rubies!\u201d \u201cAh! my dear Charles, at least one can see that you know what you\u2019re talking about, you\u2019re not like that brute Monserfeuil who asked me if they were real. I must say that I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like them. They were a present from the Grand Duchess. They\u2019re a little too large for my liking, a little too like claret glasses filled to the brim, but I\u2019ve put them on because we shall be seeing the Grand Duchess this evening at Marie-Gilbert\u2019s,\u201d added Mme. de Guermantes, never suspecting that this assertion destroyed the force of those previously made by the Duke. \u201cWhat\u2019s on at the Princess\u2019s?\u201d inquired Swann. \u201cPractically nothing,\u201d the Duke hastened to reply, the question having made him think that Swann was not invited. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, Basin? When all the highways and hedgerows have been scoured? It will be a deathly crush. What will be pretty, though,\u201d she went on, looking wistfully at Swann, \u201cif the storm I can feel in the air now doesn\u2019t break, will be those marvellous gardens. You know them, of course. I was there a month ago, at the time when the lilacs were in flower, you can\u2019t have any idea how lovely they were. And then the fountain, really, it\u2019s Versailles in Paris.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of person is the Princess?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy, you know quite well, you\u2019ve seen her here, she\u2019s as beautiful as the day, also rather an idiot. Very nice, in spite of all her Germanic high-and-mightiness, full of good nature and stupid mistakes.\u201d Swann was too subtle not to perceive that the Duchess, in this speech, was trying to shew the \u2018Guermantes wit,\u2019 and at no great cost to herself, for she was only serving up in a less perfect form an old saying of her own. Nevertheless, to prove to the Duchess that he appreciated her intention to be, and as though she had really succeeded in being, funny, he smiled with a slightly forced air, causing me by this particular form of insincerity the same feeling of awkwardness that used to disturb me long ago when I heard my parents discussing with M. Vinteuil the corruption of certain sections of society (when they knew very well that a corruption far greater sat enthroned at Montjouvain), Legrandin colouring his utterances for the benefit of fools, choosing delicate epithets which he knew perfectly well would not be understood by a rich or smart but illiterate public. \u201cCome now, Oriane, what on earth are you saying?\u201d broke in M. de Guermantes. \u201cMarie a fool? Why, she has read everything, she\u2019s as musical as a fiddle.\u201d \u201cBut, my poor little Basin, you\u2019re as innocent as a new-born babe. As if one could not be all that, and rather an idiot as well. Idiot is too strong a word; no, she\u2019s in the clouds, she\u2019s Hesse-Darmstadt, Holy Roman Empire, and! wa-wa-wa. Her pronunciation alone makes me tired. But I quite admit that she\u2019s a charming loony. Simply the idea of stepping down from her German throne to go and marry, in the most middle-class way, a private citizen. It is true that she chose him! Yes, it\u2019s quite true,\u201d she went on, turning to me, \u201cyou don\u2019t know Gilbert. Let me give you an idea of him, he took to his bed once because I had left a card on Mme. Carnot. But, my little Charles,\u201d said the Duchess, changing the conversation when she saw that the story of the card left on the Carnots appeared to irritate M. de Guermantes, \u201cyou know, you\u2019ve never sent me that photograph of our Knights of Rhodes, whom I\u2019ve learned to love through you, and I am so anxious to make their acquaintance.\u201d The Duke meanwhile had not taken his eyes from his wife\u2019s face. \u201cOriane, you might at least tell the story properly and not cut out half. I ought to explain,\u201d he corrected, addressing Swann, \u201cthat the British Ambassadress at that time, who was a very worthy woman, but lived rather in the moon and was in the habit of making up these odd combinations, conceived the distinctly quaint idea of inviting us with the President and his wife. We were \u2014 Oriane herself was rather surprised, especially as the Ambassadress knew quite enough of the people we knew not to invite us, of all things, to so ill-assorted a gathering. There was a Minister there who is a swindler, however I pass over all that, we had not been warned in time, were caught in the trap, and, I\u2019m bound to admit, all these people behaved most civilly to us. Only, once was enough. Mme. de Guermantes, who does not often do me the honour of consulting me, felt it incumbent upon her to leave a card in the course of the following week at the Elys\u00e9e. Gilbert may perhaps have gone rather far in regarding it as a stain upon our name. But it must not be forgotten that, politics apart, M. Carnot, who for that matter filled his post quite adequately, was the grandson of a member of the Revolutionary Tribunal which caused the death of eleven of our people in a single day.\u201d \u201cIn that case, Basin, why did you go every week to dine at Chantilly? The Due d\u2019Aumale was just as much the grandson of a member of the Revolutionary Tribunal, with this difference, that Carnot was a brave man and Philippe Egalit\u00e9 a wretched scoundrel.\u201d \u201cExcuse my interrupting you to explain that I did send the photograph,\u201d said Swann. \u201cI can\u2019t understand how it hasn\u2019t reached you.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t altogether surprise me,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201cmy servants tell me only what they think fit. They probably do not approve of the Order of Saint John.\u201d And she rang the bell. \u201cYou, know, Oriane, that when I used to go to Chantilly it was without enthusiasm.\u201d \u201cWithout enthusiasm, but with a nightshirt in a bag, in case the Prince asked you to stay, which for that matter he very rarely did, being a perfect cad like all the Orl\u00e9ans lot. Do you know who else are to be dining at Mme. de Saint-Euverte\u2019s?\u201d Mme. de Guermantes asked her husband. \u201cBesides the people you know already, she\u2019s asked at the last moment King Theodosius\u2019s brother.\u201d At these tidings the Duchess\u2019s features breathed contentment and her speech boredom. \u201cOh, good heavens, more princes!\u201d \u201cBut that one is well-mannered and intelligent,\u201d Swann suggested. \u201cNot altogether, though,\u201d replied the Duchess, apparently seeking for words that would give more novelty to the thought expressed. \u201cHave you ever noticed with princes that the best-mannered among them are not really well-mannered? They must always have an opinion about everything. Then, as they have none of their own, they spend the first half of their lives asking us ours and the other half serving it up to us secondhand. They positively must be able to say that one piece has been well played and the next not so well. When there is no difference. Listen, this little Theodosius junior (I forget his name) asked me what one called an orchestral motif. I replied,\u201d said the Duchess, her eyes sparkling while a laugh broke from her beautiful red lips: \u201c\u2018One calls it an orchestral motif.\u2019 I don\u2019t think he was any too well pleased, really. Oh, my dear Charles,\u201d she went on, \u201cwhat a bore it can be, dining out. There are evenings when one would sooner die! It is true that dying may be perhaps just as great a bore, because we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like.\u201d A servant appeared. It was the young lover who used to have trouble with the porter, until the Duchess, in her kindness of heart, brought about an apparent peace between them. \u201cAm I to go up this evening to inquire for M. le Marquis d\u2019Osmond?\u201d he asked. \u201cMost certainly not, nothing before to-morrow morning. In fact I don\u2019t want you to remain in the house to-night. The only thing that will happen will be that his footman, who knows you, will come to you with the latest report and send you out after us. Get off, go anywhere you like, have a woman, sleep out, but I don\u2019t want to see you here before to-morrow morning.\u201d An immense joy overflowed from the footman\u2019s face. He would at last be able to spend long hours with his ladylove, whom he had practically ceased to see ever since, after a final scene with the porter, the Duchess had considerately explained to him that it would be better, to avoid further conflicts, if he did not go out at all. He floated, at the thought of having an evening free at last, in a happiness which the Duchess saw and guessed its reason. She felt, so to speak, a tightening of the heart and an itching in all her limbs at the sight of this happiness which an amorous couple were snatching behind her back, concealing themselves from her, which left her irritated and jealous. \u201cNo, Basin, let him stay here; I say, he\u2019s not to stir out of the house.\u201d \u201cBut, Oriane, that\u2019s absurd, the house is crammed with servants, and you have the costumier\u2019s people coming as well at twelve to dress us for this show. There\u2019s absolutely nothing for him to do, and he\u2019s the only one who\u2019s a friend of Mama\u2019s footman; I would a thousand times rather get him right away from the house.\u201d \u201cListen, Basin, let me do what I want, I shall have a message for him to take in the evening, as it happens, I can\u2019t tell yet at what time. In any case you\u2019re not to go out of the house for a single instant, do you hear?\u201d she said to the despairing footman. If there were continual quarrels, and if servants did not stay long with the Duchess, the person to whose charge this guerrilla warfare was to be laid was indeed irremovable, but it was not the porter; no doubt for the rougher tasks, for the martyrdoms that it was more tiring to inflict, for the quarrels which ended in blows, the Duchess entrusted the heavier instruments to him; but even then he played his part without the least suspicion that he had been cast for it. Like the household servants, he admired the Duchess for her kindness of heart; and footmen of little discernment who came back, after leaving her service, to visit Fran\u00e7oise used to say that the Duke\u2019s house would have been the finest \u2018place\u2019 in Paris if it had not been for the porter\u2019s lodge. The Duchess \u2018played\u2019 the lodge on them, just as at different times clericalism, freemasonry, the Jewish peril have been played on the public. Another footman came into the room. \u201cWhy have not they brought up the package that M. Swann sent here? And, by the way (you\u2019ve heard, Charles, that Mama is seriously ill?), Jules went up to inquire for news of M. le Marquis d\u2019Osmond: has he come back yet?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s just come this instant, M. le Duc. They\u2019re waiting from one moment to the next for M. le Marquis to pass away.\u201d \u201cAh! He\u2019s alive!\u201d exclaimed the Duke with a sigh of relief. \u201cThat\u2019s all right, that\u2019s all right: sold again, Satan! While there\u2019s life there\u2019s hope,\u201d the Duke announced to us with a joyful air. \u201cThey\u2019ve been talking about him as though he were dead and buried. In a week from now he\u2019ll be fitter than I am.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the Doctors who said that he wouldn\u2019t last out the evening. One of them wanted to call again during the night. The head one said it was no use. M. le Marquis would be dead by then; they\u2019ve only kept him alive by injecting him with camphorated oil.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, you damned fool,\u201d cried the Duke in a paroxysm of rage. \u201cWho the devil asked you to say all that? You haven\u2019t understood a word of what they told you.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me they told, it was Jules.\u201d \u201cWill you hold your tongue!\u201d roared the Duke, and, turning to Swann, \u201cWhat a blessing he\u2019s still alive! He will regain his strength gradually, don\u2019t you know. Still alive, after being in such a critical state, that in itself is an excellent sign. One mustn\u2019t expect everything at once. It can\u2019t be at all unpleasant, a little injection of camphorated oil.\u201d He rubbed his hands. \u201cHe\u2019s alive; what more could anyone want? After going through all that he\u2019s gone through, it\u2019s a great step forward. Upon my word, I envy him having such a temperament. Ah! these invalids, you know, people do all sorts of little things for them that they don\u2019t do for us. Now to-day there was a devil of a cook who sent me up a leg of mutton with b\u00e9arnaise sauce \u2014 it was done to a turn, I must admit, but just for that very reason I took so much of it that it\u2019s still lying on my stomach. However, that doesn\u2019t make people come to inquire for me as they do for dear Amanien. We do too much inquiring. It only tires him. We must let him have room to breathe. They\u2019re killing the poor fellow by sending round to him all the time.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said the Duchess to the footman as he was leaving the room, \u201cI gave orders for the envelope containing a photograph which M. Swann sent me to be brought up here.\u201d \u201cMadame la Duchesse, it is so large that I didn\u2019t know if I could get it through the door. We have left it in the hall. Does Madame la Duchesse wish me to bring it up?\u201d \u201cOh, in that case, no; they ought to have told me, but if it\u2019s so big I shall see it in a moment when I come downstairs.\u201d \u201cI forgot to tell Mme. la Duchesse that Mme. la Comtesse Mole left a card this morning for Mme. la Duchesse.\u201d \u201cWhat, this morning?\u201d said the Duchess with an air of disapproval, feeling that so young a woman ought not to take the liberty of leaving cards in the morning. \u201cAbout ten o\u2019clock, Madame la Duchesse.\u201d \u201cShew me the cards.\u201d \u201cIn any case, Oriane, when you say that it was a funny idea on Marie\u2019s part to marry Gilbert,\u201d went on the Duke, reverting to the original topic of conversation, \u201cit is you who have an odd way of writing history. If either of them was a fool, it was Gilbert, for having married of all people a woman so closely related to the King of the Belgians, who has usurped the name of Brabant which belongs to us. To put it briefly, we are of the same blood as the Hesses, and of the elder branch. It is always stupid to talk about oneself,\u201d he apologised to me, \u201cbut after all, whenever we have been not only at Darmstadt, but even at Cassel and all over Electoral Hesse, the Landgraves have always, all of them, been most courteous in giving us precedence as being of the elder branch.\u201d \u201cBut really, Basin, you don\u2019t mean to tell me that a person who was a Major in every regiment in her country, who had been engaged to the King of Sweden . . . \u201d \u201cOriane, that is too much; anyone would think that you didn\u2019t know that the King of Sweden\u2019s grandfather was tilling the soil at Pau when we had been ruling the roost for nine hundred years throughout the whole of Europe.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t alter the fact that if somebody were to say in the street: \u2018Hallo, there\u2019s the King of Sweden,\u2019 everyone would at once rush to see him as far as the Place de la Concorde, and if he said: \u2018There\u2019s M. de Guermantes,\u2019 nobody would know who M. de Guermantes was.\u201d \u201cWhat an argument!\u201d \u201cBesides, I never can understand how, once the title of Duke of Brabant has passed to the Belgian Royal Family, you can continue to claim it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The footman returned with the Comtesse Mole\u2019s card, or rather what she had left in place of a card. Alleging that she had none on her, she had taken from her pocket a letter addressed to herself, and keeping the contents had handed in the envelope which bore the inscription: \u2018La Comtesse Mole.\u2019 As the envelope was rather large, following the fashion in notepaper which prevailed that year, this manuscript \u2018card\u2019 was almost twice the size of an ordinary visiting card. \u201cThat is what people call Mme. Mole\u2019s \u2018simplicity,\u2019\u201d said the Duchess ironically. \u201cShe wants to make us think that she had no cards on her, and to shew her originality. But we know all about that, don\u2019t we, my little Charles, we are quite old enough and quite original enough ourselves to see through the tricks of a little lady who has only been going about for four years. She is charming, but she doesn\u2019t seem to me, all the same, to be quite \u2018big\u2019 enough to imagine that she can take the world by surprise with so little effort as merely leaving an envelope instead of a card and leaving it at ten o\u2019clock in the morning. Her old mother mouse will shew her that she knows a thing or two about that.\u201d Swann could not help smiling at the thought that the Duchess, who was, incidentally, a trifle jealous of Mme. Mole\u2019s success, would find it quite in accordance with the \u2018Guermantes wit\u2019 to make some impertinent retort to her visitor. \u201cSo far as the title of Duc de Brabant is concerned, I\u2019ve told you a hundred times, Oriane . . . \u201d the Duke continued, but the Duchess, without listening, cut him short. \u201cBut, my little Charles, I\u2019m longing to see your photograph.\u201d \u201cAh! Extinctor draconis latrator Anubis,\u201d said Swann. \u201cYes, it was so charming what you said about that when you were comparing the Saint George at Venice. But I don\u2019t understand: why Anubis?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the one like who was an ancestor of Babal?\u201d asked M. de Guermantes. \u201cYou want to see his bauble?\u201d retorted his wife, dryly, to shew she herself scorned the pun. \u201cI want to see them all,\u201d she added. \u201cListen, Charles, let us wait downstairs till the carriage comes,\u201d said the Duke; \u201cyou can pay your call on us in the hall, because my wife won\u2019t let us have any peace until she\u2019s seen your photograph. I am less impatient, I must say,\u201d he added with a satisfied air. \u201cI am not easily moved myself, but she would see us all dead rather than miss it.\u201d \u201cI am entirely of your opinion, Basin,\u201d said the Duchess, \u201clet us go into the hall; we shall at least know why we have come down from your study, while we shall never know how we have come down from the Counts of Brabant.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve told you a hundred times how the title came into the House of Hesse,\u201d said the Duke (while we were going downstairs to look at the photograph, and I thought of those that Swann used to bring me at Combray), \u201cthrough the marriage of a Brabant in 1241 with the daughter of the last Landgrave of Thuringia and Hesse, so that really it is the title of Prince of Hesse that came to the House of Brabant rather than that of Duke of Brabant to the House of Hesse. You will remember that our battle-cry was that of the Dukes of Brabant: \u2018Limbourg to her conqueror!\u2019 until we exchanged the arms of Brabant for those of Guermantes, in which I think myself that we were wrong, and the example of the Gramonts will not make me change my opinion.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes, \u201cas it is the King of the Belgians who is the conqueror . . . Besides the Belgian Crown Prince calls himself Duc de Brabant.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear child, your argument will not hold water for a moment. You know as well as I do that there are titles of pretension which can perfectly well exist even if the territory is occupied by usurpers. For instance, the King of Spain describes himself equally as Duke of Brabant, claiming in virtue of a possession less ancient than ours, but more ancient than that of the King of the Belgians. He calls himself also Duke of Burgundy, King of the Indies Occidental and Oriental, and Duke of Milan. Well, he is no more in possession of Burgundy, the Indies or Brabant than I possess Brabant myself, or the Prince of Hesse either, for that matter. The King of Spain likewise proclaims himself King of Jerusalem, as does the Austrian Emperor, and Jerusalem belongs to neither one nor the other.\u201d He stopped for a moment with an awkward feeling that the mention of Jerusalem might have embarrassed Swann, in view of \u2018current events,\u2019 but only went on more rapidly: \u201cWhat you said just now might be said of anyone. We were at one time Dukes of Aumale, a duchy that has passed as regularly to the House of France as Joinville and Chevreuse have to the House of Albert. We make no more claim to those titles than to that of Marquis de Noirmoutiers, which was at one time ours, and became perfectly regularly the appanage of the House of La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, but because certain cessions are valid, it does not follow that they all are. For instance,\u201d he went on, turning to me, \u201cmy sister-in-law\u2019s son bears the title of Prince d\u2019Agrigente, which comes to us from Joan the Mad, as that of Prince de Tarente comes to the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles. Well, Napoleon went and gave this title of Tarente to a soldier, who may have been admirable in the ranks, but in doing so the Emperor was disposing of what belonged to him even less than Napoleon III when he created a Duc de Montmorency, since P\u00e9rigord had at least a mother who was a Montmorency, while the Tarente of Napoleon I had no more Tarente about him than Napoleon\u2019s wish that he should become so. That did not prevent Chaix d\u2019Est-Ange, alluding to our uncle Cond\u00e9, from asking the Procurer Imp\u00e9rial if he had picked up the title of Duc de Montmorency in the moat of Vincennes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, Basin, I ask for nothing better than to follow you to the ditches of Vincennes, or even to Tarante. And that reminds me, Charles, of what I was going to say to you when you were telling me about your Saint George at Venice. We have an idea, Basin and I, of spending next spring in Italy and Sicily. If you were to come with us, just think what a difference it would make! I\u2019m not thinking only of the pleasure of seeing you, but imagine, after all you\u2019ve told me so often about the remains of the Norman Conquest and of ancient history, imagine what a trip like that would become if you came with us! I mean to say that even Basin \u2014 what am I saying, Gilbert \u2014 would benefit by it, because I feel that even his claims to the throne of Naples and all that sort of thing would interest me if they were explained by you in old romanesque churches in little villages perched on hills like primitive paintings. But now we\u2019re going to look at your photograph. Open the envelope,\u201d said the Duchess to a footman. \u201cPlease, Oriane, not this evening; you can look at it to-morrow,\u201d implored the Duke, who had already been making signs of alarm to me on seeing the huge size of the photograph. \u201cBut I like to look at it with Charles,\u201d said the Duchess, with a smile at once artificially concupiscent and psychologically subtle, for in her desire to be friendly to Swann she spoke of the pleasure which she would have in looking at the photograph as though it were the pleasure an invalid feels he would find in eating an orange, or as though she had managed to combine an escapade with her friends with giving information to a biographer as to some of her favourite pursuits. \u201cAll right, he will come again to see you, on purpose,\u201d declared the Duke, to whom his wife was obliged to yield. \u201cYou can spend three hours in front of it, if that amuses you,\u201d he added ironically. \u201cBut where are you going to stick a toy of those dimensions?\u201d \u201cWhy, in my room, of course. I like to have it before my eyes.\u201d \u201cOh, just as you please; if it\u2019s in your room, probably I shall never see it,\u201d said the Duke, without thinking of the revelation he was thus blindly making of the negative character of his conjugal relations. \u201cVery well, you will undo it with the greatest care,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes told the servant, multiplying her instructions out of politeness to Swann. \u201cAnd see that you don\u2019t crumple the envelope, either.\u201d \u201cSo even the envelope has got to be respected!\u201d the Duke murmured to me, raising his eyes to the ceiling. \u201cBut, Swann,\u201d he added, \u201cI, who am only a poor married man and thoroughly prosaic, what I wonder at is how on earth you managed to find an envelope that size. Where did you pick it up?\u201d \u201cOh, at the photographer\u2019s; they\u2019re always sending out things like that. But the man is a fool, for I see he\u2019s written on it \u2018The Duchesse de Guermantes,\u2019 without putting \u2018Madame.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll forgive him for that,\u201d said the Duchess carelessly; then, seeming to be struck by a sudden idea which enlivened her, checked a faint smile; but at once returning to Swann: \u201cWell, you don\u2019t say whether you\u2019re coming to Italy with us?\u201d \u201cMadame, I am really afraid that it will not be possible.\u201d \u201cIndeed! Mme. de Montmorency is more fortunate. You went with her to Venice and Vicenza. She told me that with you one saw things one would never see otherwise, things no one had ever thought of mentioning before, that you shewed her things she had never dreamed of, and that even in the well-known things she had been able to appreciate details which without you she might have passed by a dozen times without ever noticing. Obviously, she has been more highly favoured than we are to be. . . . You will take the big envelope from M. Swann\u2019s photograph,\u201d she said to the servant, \u201cand you will hand it in, from me, this evening at half past ten at Mme. la Comtesse Mole\u2019s.\u201d Swann laughed. \u201cI should like to know, all the same,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes asked him, \u201chow, ten months before the time, you can tell that a thing will be impossible.\u201d \u201cMy dear Duchess, I will tell you if you insist upon it, but, first of all, you can see that I am very ill.\u201d \u201cYes, my little Charles, I don\u2019t think you look at all well. I\u2019m not pleased with your colour, but I\u2019m not asking you to come with me next week, I ask you to come in ten months. In ten months one has time to get oneself cured, you know.\u201d At this point a footman came in to say that the carriage was at the door. \u201cCome, Oriane, to horse,\u201d said the Duke, already pawing the ground with impatience as though he were himself one of the horses that stood waiting outside. \u201cVery well, give me in one word the reason why you can\u2019t come to Italy,\u201d the Duchess put it to Swann as she rose to say good-bye to us. \u201cBut, my dear friend, it\u2019s because I shall then have been dead for several months. According to the doctors I consulted last winter, the thing I\u2019ve got \u2014 which may, for that matter, carry me off at any moment \u2014 won\u2019t in any case leave me more than three or four months to live, and even that is a generous estimate,\u201d replied Swann with a smile, while the footman opened the glazed door of the hall to let the Duchess out. \u201cWhat\u2019s that you say?\u201d cried the Duchess, stopping for a moment on her way to the carriage, and raising her fine eyes, their melancholy blue clouded by uncertainty. Placed for the first time in her life between two duties as incompatible as getting into her carriage to go out to dinner and shewing pity for a man who was about to die, she could find nothing in the code of conventions that indicated the right line to follow, and, not knowing which to choose, felt it better to make a show of not believing that the latter alternative need be seriously considered, so as to follow the first, which demanded of her at the moment less effort, and thought that the best way of settling the conflict would be to deny that any existed. \u201cYou\u2019re joking,\u201d she said to Swann. \u201cIt would be a joke in charming taste,\u201d replied he ironically. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I am telling you this; I have never said a word to you before about my illness. But as you asked me, and as now I may die at any moment . . . But whatever I do I mustn\u2019t make you late; you\u2019re dining out, remember,\u201d he added, because he knew that for other people their own social obligations took precedence of the death of a friend, and could put himself in her place by dint of his instinctive politeness. But that of the Duchess enabled her also to perceive in a vague way that the dinner to which she was going must count for less to Swann than his own death. And so, while continuing on her way towards the carriage, she let her shoulders droop, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about our dinner. It\u2019s not of any importance!\u201d But this put the Duke in a bad humour, who exclaimed: \u201cCome, Oriane, don\u2019t stop there chattering like that and exchanging your jeremiads with Swann; you know very well that Mme. de Saint-Euverte insists on sitting down to table at eight o\u2019clock sharp. We must know what you propose to do; the horses have been waiting for a good five minutes. I beg your pardon, Charles,\u201d he went on, turning to Swann, \u201cbut it\u2019s ten minutes to eight already. Oriane is always late, and it will take us more than five minutes to get to old Saint-Euverte\u2019s.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes advanced resolutely towards the carriage and uttered a last farewell to Swann. \u201cYou know, we can talk about that another time; I don\u2019t believe a word you\u2019ve been saying, but we must discuss it quietly. I expect they gave you a dreadful fright, come to luncheon, whatever day you like\u201d (with Mme. de Guermantes things always resolved themselves into luncheons), \u201cyou will let me know your day and time,\u201d and, lifting her red skirt, she set her foot on the step. She was just getting into the carriage when, seeing this foot exposed, the Duke cried in a terrifying voice: \u201cOriane, what have you been thinking of, you wretch? You\u2019ve kept on your black shoes! With a red dress! Go upstairs quick and put on red shoes, or rather,\u201d he said to the footman, \u201ctell the lady\u2019s maid at once to bring down a pair of red shoes.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear,\u201d replied the Duchess gently, annoyed to see that Swann, who was leaving the house with me but had stood back to allow the carriage to pass out in front of us, could hear, \u201csince we are late.\u201d \u201cNo, no, we have plenty of time. It is only ten to; it won\u2019t take us ten minutes to get to the Parc Monceau. And, after all, what would it matter? If we turned up at half past eight they\u2019d have to wait for us, but you can\u2019t possibly go there in a red dress and black shoes. Besides, we shan\u2019t be the last, I can tell you; the Sassenages are coming, and you know they never arrive before twenty to nine.\u201d The Duchess went up to her room. \u201cWell,\u201d said M. de Guermantes to Swann and myself, \u201cwe poor, down-trodden husbands, people laugh at us, but we are of some use all the same. But for me, Oriane would have been going out to dinner in black shoes.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not unbecoming,\u201d said Swann, \u201cI noticed the black shoes and they didn\u2019t offend me in the least.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t say you\u2019re wrong,\u201d replied the Duke, \u201cbut it looks better to have them to match the dress. Besides, you needn\u2019t worry, she would no sooner have got there than she\u2019d have noticed them, and I should have been obliged to come home and fetch the others. I should have had my dinner at nine o\u2019clock. Good-bye, my children,\u201d he said, thrusting us gently from the door, \u201cget away, before Oriane comes down again. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t like seeing you both. On the contrary, she\u2019s too fond of your company. If she finds you still here she will start talking again, she is tired out already, she\u2019ll reach the dinner-table quite dead. Besides, I tell you frankly, I\u2019m dying of hunger. I had a wretched luncheon this morning when I came from the train. There was the devil of a b\u00e9arnaise sauce, I admit, but in spite of that I shan\u2019t be at all sorry, not at all sorry to sit down to dinner. Five minutes to eight! Oh, women, women! She\u2019ll give us both indigestion before to-morrow. She is not nearly as strong as people think.\u201d The Duke felt no compunction at speaking thus of his wife\u2019s ailments and his own to a dying man, for the former interested him more, appeared to him more important. And so it was simply from good breeding and good fellowship that, after politely shewing us out, he cried \u2018from off stage,\u2019 in a stentorian voice from the porch to Swann, who was already in the courtyard: \u201cYou, now, don\u2019t let yourself be taken in by the doctors\u2019 nonsense, damn them. They\u2019re donkeys. You\u2019re as strong as the Pont Neuf. You\u2019ll live to bury us all!\u201dEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1257573", "artist_names": "LaVern Baker", "full_title": "Wheel Of Fortune by\u00a0LaVern\u00a0Baker", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/bd4d21562c592c96027b4e408b82815c.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bd4d21562c592c96027b4e408b82815c.599x599x1.jpg", "id": 1257573, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429725634, "path": "/Lavern-baker-wheel-of-fortune-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Lavern-baker-wheel-of-fortune-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/bd4d21562c592c96027b4e408b82815c.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bd4d21562c592c96027b4e408b82815c.599x599x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Wheel Of Fortune", "title_with_featured": "Wheel Of Fortune", "updated_by_human_at": 1593664270, "url": "https://genius.com/Lavern-baker-wheel-of-fortune-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/60432", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c5353c0b40f60b3a524a3f0256d48266.300x279x1.jpg", "id": 60432, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c5353c0b40f60b3a524a3f0256d48266.300x279x1.jpg", "index_character": "l", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "LaVern Baker", "slug": "Lavern-baker", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Lavern-baker"}, "artist": "LaVern Baker", "lyrics": "Wheel Of Fortune LyricsThe wheel of fortune goes spinning round\nWill the arrow point my way, will this be the day?\nOh, wheel of fortune, please don't pass me by\nLet me know the magic of a kiss and a sigh\n\nWhile the wheel is spinning, spinning, spinning\nI'll not dream of winning fortune or fame\nWhile the wheel is turning, turning, turning\nI'll be ever yearning for love's precious flame\n\nOh, wheel of fortune, I'm hoping somehow\nIf you'll ever smile on me, please let it be nowYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 502, "api_path": "/songs/141146", "artist_names": "James Joyce", "full_title": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe) by\u00a0James\u00a0Joyce", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "id": 141146, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 149810, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1654772452, "path": "/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-15-circe-annotated", "pyongs_count": 10, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-15-circe-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1922, "month": 2, "day": 2}, "release_date_for_display": "February 2, 1922", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 2, 1922", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 361, "hot": false, "pageviews": 50072}, "title": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe)", "title_with_featured": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe)", "updated_by_human_at": 1654772453, "url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-15-circe-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/22971", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/98f10611fc0aa6a525b9fbcab2ffa297.1000x600x1.jpg", "id": 22971, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9997f2e769ef85b9f941405cac99d1af.570x570x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "James Joyce", "slug": "James-joyce", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/James-joyce"}, "artist": "James Joyce", "lyrics": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe) LyricsThe Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals.

The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?\n\nTHE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)\n\n(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)\n\nLONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me.

Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral.

You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape.

Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening.

You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury.

Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.)

God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father!

(He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!\n\n\nTHE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!\n\n\n(The rams' horns sound for silence.

I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S.

Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined.

She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps.

Ahhkkk!\n\nELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.\n\nZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.\n\nFLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.\n\nSTEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.\n\n(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)\n\nTHE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.\n\nLYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.\n\n(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!\n\n(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)\n\nZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?\n\nLYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way.

Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth?

Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.)

And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!\n\nBLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!\n\nBELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.\n\nBELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.\n\nLYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.\n\nZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering.

Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter.

R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands.

They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place.

He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand!

(His features grow drawn and grey and old.)\n\n\nBLOOM (At the window.) What?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on!

After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter.

Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour!

Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.)

I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/7690767", "artist_names": "Mitch Miller", "full_title": "Do Re Mi by\u00a0Mitch\u00a0Miller", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/b0670115bf76c1aa653e6ab895ad3709.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b0670115bf76c1aa653e6ab895ad3709.600x600x1.jpg", "id": 7690767, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 15822760, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1668636361, "path": "/Mitch-miller-do-re-mi-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Mitch-miller-do-re-mi-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/b0670115bf76c1aa653e6ab895ad3709.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b0670115bf76c1aa653e6ab895ad3709.600x600x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Do Re Mi", "title_with_featured": "Do Re Mi", "updated_by_human_at": 1668636361, "url": "https://genius.com/Mitch-miller-do-re-mi-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/361948", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c9ad74c5e0178fd67cd711a1a715568b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 361948, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c9ad74c5e0178fd67cd711a1a715568b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "m", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Mitch Miller", "slug": "Mitch-miller", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Mitch-miller"}, "artist": "Mitch Miller", "lyrics": "Do Re Mi Lyrics[Intro]\nDo (Do) re (Re) mi (Mi)\nFa (Fa) so (So) la (La) ti (Ti) do (Do)\n\nDo, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do!\n\n[Chorus]\n(Do!) doe, a deer, a female deer\n(Re!) ray, a drop of golden sun\n(Mi!) me, a name I call myself\n(Fa!) far, a long, long way to run\n(So!) sew, a needle-pulling thread\n(La!) la, a note to follow so\n(Ti!) tea, a drink with jam and bread\nThat will bring us back to do oh oh oh\n[Chorus]\nDo!

I learn from you, I admire you and I love you.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis is a small hymn to an exaltation of women.\nR'lene Dahlberg fanned the embers.\nLisa Schwarzbaum read early pages and encouraged me.\nMary Breasted Smyth, elegant novelist herself, read the first third\nand passed it on to Molly Friedrich, who became my agent and thought that Nan Graham, Editor-in-Chief at Scribner, would be just the right person to put the book on the road.\nAnd Molly was right.\nMy daughter, Maggie, has shown me how life can be a grand adventure, while exquisite moments with my granddaughter, Chiara, have helped me recall a small child's wonder.\nMy wife, Ellen, listened while I read and cheered me to the final\npage.\nI am blessed among men.\n\nI\nMy father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born. Instead, they returned to Ireland when I was four, my brother, Malachy, three, the twins, Oliver and Eugene, barely one, and my sister, Margaret, dead and gone.\nWhen I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood: the happy childhood is hardly worth your while. Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\nPeople everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years.\nAbove all-we were wet.\nOut in the Atlantic Ocean great sheets of rain gathered to drift slowly up the River Shannon and settle forever in Limerick. The rain dampened the city from the Feast of the Circumcision to New Year's Eve.\nIt created a cacophony of hacking coughs, bronchial rattles, asthmatic wheezes, consumptive croaks. It turned noses into fountains, lungs into bacterial sponges. It provoked cures galore; to ease the catarrh you boiled onions in milk blackened with pepper; for the congested passages you made a paste of boiled flour and nettles, wrapped it in a rag, and slapped it, sizzling, on the chest.\nFrom October to April the walls of Limerick glistened with the damp. Clothes never dried: tweed and woolen coats housed living things, sometimes sprouted mysterious vegetations. In pubs, steam rose from damp bodies and garments to be inhaled with cigarette and pipe smoke laced with the stale fumes of spilled stout and whiskey and tinged with the odor of piss wafting in from the outdoor jakes where many a man puked up his week's wages.\nThe rain drove us into the church-our refuge, our strength, our only dry place. At Mass, Benediction, novenas, we huddled in great damp clumps, dozing through priest drone, while steam rose again from our clothes to mingle with the sweetness of incense, flowers and candles.\nLimerick gained a reputation for piety, but we knew it was only the\nrain.\nMy father, Malachy McCourt, was born on a farm in Toome, County\nAntrim. Like his father before, he grew up wild, in trouble with the English, or the Irish, or both. He fought with the Old IRA and for some desperate act he wound up a fugitive with a price on his head.\nWhen I was a child I would look at my father, the thinning hair, the collapsing teeth, and wonder why anyone would give money for a head like that. When I was thirteen my father's mother told me a secret: as a wee lad your poor father was dropped on his head. It was an accident, he was never the same after, and you must remember that people dropped on their heads can be a bit peculiar.\nBecause of the price on the head he had been dropped on, he had to be spirited out of Ireland via cargo ship from Galway. In New York, with Prohibition in full swing, he thought he had died and gone to hell for his sins. Then he discovered speakeasies and he rejoiced.\nAfter wandering and drinking in America and England he yearned for peace in his declining years. He returned to Belfast, which erupted all around him. He said, A pox on all their houses, and chatted with the ladies of Andersontown. They tempted him with delicacies but he waved them away and drank his tea. He no longer smoked or touched alcohol, so what was the use? It was time to go and he died in the Royal Victoria Hospital.\nMy mother, the former Angela Sheehan, grew up in a Limerick slum with her mother, two brothers, Thomas and Patrick, and a sister, Agnes. She never saw her father, who had run off to Australia weeks before her birth.\nAfter a night of drinking porter in the pubs of Limerick he staggers down the lane singing his favorite song, Who threw the overalls in Mrs. Murphy's chowder?\nNobody spoke so he said it all the louder It's a dirty Irish trick and I can lick the Mick Who threw the overalls in Murphy's chowder.\nHe's in great form altogether and he thinks he'll play a while with little Patrick, one year old. Lovely little fella. Loves his daddy. Laughs when Daddy throws him up in the air. Upsy daisy, little Paddy, upsy daisy, up in the air in the dark, so dark, oh, Jasus, you miss the child on the way down and poor little Patrick lands on his head, gurgles\na bit, whimpers, goes quiet. Grandma heaves herself from the bed, heavy with the child in her belly, my mother. She's barely able to lift little Patrick from the floor. She moans a long moan over the child and turns on Grandpa. Get out of it. Out. If you stay here a minute longer I'll take the hatchet to you, you drunken lunatic. By Jesus, I'll swing at the end of a rope for you. Get out.\nGrandpa stands his ground like a man. I have a right, he says, to stay in me own house.\nShe runs at him and he melts before this whirling dervish with a damaged child in her arms and a healthy one stirring inside. He stumbles from the house, up the lane, and doesn't stop till he reaches Melbourne in Australia.\nLittle Pat, my uncle, was never the same after. He grew up soft in the head with a left leg that went one way, his body the other. He never learned to read or write but God blessed him in another way. When he started to sell newspapers at the age of eight he could count money better than the Chancellor of the Exchequer himself. No one knew why he was called Ab Sheehan, The Abbot, but all Limerick loved him.\nMy mother's troubles began the night she was born. There is my grandmother in the bed heaving and gasping with the labor pains, praying to St. Gerard Majella, patron saint of expectant mothers. There is Nurse O'Halloran, the midwife, all dressed up in her finery. It's New Year's Eve and Mrs. O'Halloran is anxious for this child to be born so that she can rush off to the parties and celebrations. She tells my grandmother: Will you push, will you, push. Jesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph, if you don't hurry with this child it won't be born till the New Year and what good is that to me with me new dress? Never mind St. Gerard Majella. What can a man do for a woman at a time like this even if he is a saint? St. Gerard Majella my arse.\nMy grandmother switches her prayers to St. Ann, patron saint of difficult labor. But the child won't come. Nurse O'Halloran tells my grandmother, Pray to St. Jude, patron saint of desperate cases.\nSt. Jude, patron of desperate cases, help me. I'm desperate. She grunts and pushes and the infant's head appears, only the head, my mother, and it's the stroke of midnight, the New Year. Limerick City erupts with whistles, horns, sirens, brass bands, people calling and singing, Happy New Year. Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and church bells all over ring out the Angelus and Nurse O'Halloran weeps for the waste of a dress, that child still in there and me in me finery. Will you come out, child, will you? Grandma gives a great push and the child is in the world, a lovely girl with black curly hair and sad blue eyes.\nAh, Lord above, says Nurse O'Halloran, this child is a time straddler, born with her head in the New Year and her arse in the Old or was it her head in the Old Year and her arse in the New. You'll have to write to the Pope, missus, to find out what year this child was born in and I'll save this dress for next year.\nAnd the child was named Angela for the Angelus which rang the midnight hour, the New Year, the minute of her coming and because she was a little angel anyway.\nLove her as in childhood\nThough feeble, old and grey.\nFor you'll never miss a mother's love\nTill she's buried beneath the clay.\nAt the St. Vincent de Paul School, Angela learned to read, write, and calculate and by her ninth year her schooling was done. She tried her hand at being a charwoman, a skivvy, a maid with a little white hat opening doors, but she could not manage the little curtsy that is required and her mother said, You don't have the knack of it. You're pure useless. Why don't you go to America where there's room for all sorts of uselessness? I'll give you the fare.\nShe arrived in New York just in time for the first Thanksgiving Day of the Great Depression. She met Malachy at a party given by Dan MacAdorey and his wife, Minnie, on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn. Malachy liked Angela and she liked him. He had a hangdog look, which came from the three months he had just spent in jail for hijacking a truck. He and his friend John McErlaine believed what they were told in the speakeasy, that the truck was packed to the roof with cases of canned pork and beans. Neither knew how to drive and when the police saw the truck lurch and jerk along Myrtle Avenue they pulled it over. The police searched the truck and wondered why anyone would hijack a truck containing, not pork and beans, but cases of buttons.\nWith Angela drawn to the hangdog look and Malachy lonely after three months in jail, there was bound to be a knee-trembler.\nA knee-trembler is the act itself done up against a wall, man and woman up on their toes, straining so hard their knees tremble with the excitement that's in it.\nThat knee-trembler put Angela in an interesting condition and, of course, there was talk. Angela had cousins, the MacNamara sisters, Delia and Philomena, married, respectively, to Jimmy Fortune of County Mayo, and Tommy Flynn, of Brooklyn itself.\nDelia and Philomena were large women, great-breasted and fierce. When they sailed along the sidewalks of Brooklyn lesser creatures stepped aside, respect was shown. The sisters knew what was right and they knew what was wrong and any doubts could be resolved by the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church. They knew that Angela, unmarried, had no right to be in an interesting condition and they would take steps.\nSteps they took. With Jimmy and Tommy in tow they marched to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where Malachy could be found on Friday, payday when he had a job. The man in the speak, Joey Cacciamani, did not want to admit the sisters but Philomena told him that if he wanted to keep the nose on his face and that door on its hinges he'd better open up for they were there on God's business. Joey said, Awright, awright, you Irish. Jeezoz! Trouble, trouble.\nMalachy, at the far end of the bar, turned pale, gave the great breasted ones a sickly smile, offered them a drink. They resisted the smile and spurned the offer. Delia said, We don't know what class of a tribe you come from in the North of Ireland.\nPhilomena said, There is a suspicion you might have Presbyterians in your family, which would explain what you did to our cousin.\nJimmy said, Ah, now, ah, now. 'Tisn't his fault if there's Presbyterians in his family.\nDelia said, You shuddup.\nTommy had to join in. What you did to that poor unfortunate girl is a disgrace to the Irish race and you should be ashamed of yourself.\nOch, I am, said Malachy. I am.\nNobody asked you to talk, said Philomena. You done enough damage with your blather, so shut your yap.\nAnd while your yap is shut, said Delia, we're here to see you do the right thing by our poor cousin, Angela Sheehan.\nMalachy said, Och, indeed, indeed. The right thing is the right thing and I'd be glad to buy you all a drink while we have this little\ntalk.\nTake the drink, said Tommy, and shove it up your ass.\nPhilomena said, Our little cousin no sooner gets off the boat than\nyou are at her. We have morals in Limerick, you know, morals. We're not like jackrabbits from Antrim, a place crawling with Presbyterians.\nJimmy said, He don't look like a Presbyterian.\nYou shuddup, said Delia.\nAnother thing we noticed, said Philomena. You have a very odd\nmanner.\nMalachy smiled. I do?\nabout\nYou do, says Delia. I think 'tis one of the first things we noticed you, that odd manner, and it gives us a very uneasy feeling.\n'Tis that sneaky little Presbyterian smile, said Philomena.\nOch, said Malachy, it's just the trouble I have with my teeth. Teeth or no teeth, odd manner or no odd manner, you're gonna marry\nthat girl, said Tommy. Up the middle aisle you're going.\nOch, said Malachy, I wasn't planning to get married, you know.\nThere's no work and I wouldn't be able to support... Married is what you're going to be, said Delia. Up the middle aisle, said Jimmy.\nYou shuddup, said Delia.\nMalachy watched them leave. I'm in a desperate pickle, he told Joey Cacciamani.\nBet your ass, said Joey. I see them babes comin' at me I jump inna Hudson River.\nMalachy considered the pickle he was in. He had a few dollars in his pocket from the last job and he had an uncle in San Francisco or one of the other California Sans. Wouldn't he be better off in California, far from the great breasted MacNamara sisters and their grim husbands? He would, indeed, and he'd have a drop of the Irish to celebrate his decision and departure. Joey poured and the drink nearly took the lining off Malachy's gullet. Irish, indeed! He told Joey it was a Prohibition concoction from the devil's own still. Joey shrugged. I don't know nothing. I only pour. Still, it was better than nothing and Malachy would have another and one for yourself, Joey, and ask them two decent Italians what they'd like and what are you talking about, of course, I have the money to pay for it.\nHe awoke on a bench in the Long Island Railroad Station, a cop rapping on his boots with a nightstick, his escape money gone, the MacNamara sisters ready to eat him alive in Brooklyn.\nOn the feast of St. Joseph, a bitter day in March, four months after the knee-trembler, Malachy married Angela and in August the child was born. In November Malachy got drunk and decided it was time to register the child's birth. He thought he might name the child Malachy, after himself, but his North of Ireland accent and the alcoholic mumble confused the clerk so much he simply entered the name Male on the certificate.\nNot until late December did they take Male to St. Paul's Church to be baptized and named Francis after his father's father and the lovely saint of Assisi. Angela wanted to give him a middle name, Munchin, after the patron saint of Limerick but Malachy said over his dead body. No son of his would have a Limerick name. It's hard enough going through life with one name. Sticking on middle names was an atrocious American habit and there was no need for a second name when you're christened after the man from Assisi.\nThere was a delay the day of the baptism when the chosen godfather, John McErlaine, got drunk at the speakeasy and forgot his responsibilities. Philomena told her husband, Tommy, he'd have to be godfather. Child's soul is in danger, she said. Tommy put his head down and grumbled. All right. I'll be godfather but I'm not goin' to be responsible if he grows up like his father causin' trouble and goin' through life with the odd manner for if he does he can go to John McErlaine at the speakeasy. The priest said, True for you, Tom, decent man that you are, fine man that never set foot inside a speakeasy. Malachy, fresh from the speakeasy himself, felt insulted and wanted to argue with the priest, one sacrilege on top of another. Take off that collar and we'll see who's the man. He had to be held back by the great breasted ones and their husbands grim. Angela, new mother, agitated, forgot she was holding the child and let him slip into the baptismal font, a total immersion of the Protestant type. The altar boy assisting the priest plucked the infant from the font and restored him to Angela, who sobbed and clutched him, dripping, to her bosom. The priest laughed, said he had never seen the likes, that the child was a regular little Baptist now and hardly needed a priest. This maddened Malachy again and he wanted to jump at the priest for calling the child some class of a Protestant. The priest said, Quiet, man, you're in God's house, and when Malachy said, God's house, my arse, he was thrown out on Court Street because you can't say arse in God's house.\nAfter baptism Philomena said she had tea and ham and cakes in her house around the corner. Malachy said, Tea? and she said, Yes, tea, or is it whiskey you want? He said tea was grand but first he'd have to go and deal with John McErlaine, who didn't have the decency to carry out his duties as godfather. Angela said, You're only looking for an excuse to run to the speakeasy, and he said, As God is my witness, the drink is the last thing on my mind. Angela started to cry. Your son's christening day and you have to go drinking. Delia told him he was a disgusting specimen but what could you expect from the North of Ireland.\nMalachy looked from one to the other, shifted on his feet, pulled his cap down over his eyes, shoved his hands deep in his trouser pockets, said, Och, aye, the way they do in the far reaches of County Antrim, turned, hurried up Court Street to the speakeasy on Atlantic Avenue where he was sure they'd ply him with free drink in honor of his son's baptism.\nAt Philomena's house the sisters and their husbands ate and drank while Angela sat in a corner nursing the baby and crying. Philomena stuffed her mouth with bread and ham and rumbled at Angela, That's what you get for being such a fool. Hardly off the boat and you fall for that lunatic. You shoulda stayed single, put the child up for adoption, and you'd be a free woman today. Angela cried harder and Delia took up the attack, Oh, stop it, Angela, stop it. You have nobody to blame but yourself for gettin' into trouble with a drunkard from the North, a man that doesn't even look like a Catholic, him with his odd manner. I'd say\nthat... that... Malachy has a streak of the Presbyterian in him right enough. You shuddup, Jimmy.\nIf I was you, said Philomena, I'd make sure there's no more children. He don't have a job, so he don't, an' never will the way he drinks. So... no more children, Angela. Are you listenin' to me?\nI am, Philomena.\nA year later another child was born. Angela called him Malachy after his father and gave him a middle name, Gerard, after his father's brother.\nThe MacNamara sisters said Angela was nothing but a rabbit and they wanted nothing to do with her till she came to her senses.\nTheir husbands agreed.\nI'm in a playground on Classon Avenue in Brooklyn with my brother, Malachy. He's two, I'm three. We're on the seesaw.\nUp, down, up, down.\nMalachy goes up.\nI get off.\nMalachy goes down. Seesaw hits the ground. He screams. His hand is\non his mouth and there's blood.\nOh, God. Blood is bad. My mother will kill me.\nAnd here she is, trying to run across the playground. Her big belly\nslows her.\nShe says, What did you do? What did you do to I don't know what to say. I don't know what I She pulls my ear. Go home. Go to bed. Bed?\nIn the middle of the day?\nShe pushes me toward the playground gate. Go. She picks up Malachy and waddles off.\nMy father's friend, Mr. MacAdorey, is outside\nthe child?\ndid.\nour building. He's standing at the edge of the sidewalk with his wife, Minnie, looking at a\ndog lying in the gutter. There is blood all around the dog's head. It's the color of the blood from Malachy's mouth.\nMalachy has dog blood and the dog has Malachy blood.\nI pull Mr. MacAdorey's hand. I tell him Malachy has blood like the\ndog.\nOh, he does, indeed, Francis. Cats have it, too. And Eskimos. All\nthe same blood.\nMinnie says, Stop that, Dan. Stop confusing the wee fellow. She\ntells me the poor wee dog was hit by a car and he crawled all the way from the middle of the street before he died. Wanted to come home, the poor wee creature.\nMr. MacAdorey says, You'd better go home, Francis. I don't know what you did to your wee brother, but your mother took him off to the hospital. Go home, child.\nWill Malachy die like the dog, Mr. MacAdorey? Minnie says, He bit his tongue. He won't die. Why did the dog die?\nIt was his time, Francis.\nThe apartment is empty and I wander between the two rooms, the bedroom and the kitchen. My father is out looking for a job and my mother is at the hospital with Malachy. I wish I had something to eat but there's nothing in the icebox but cabbage leaves floating in the melted ice. My father said never eat anything floating in water for the rot that might be in it. I fall asleep on my parents' bed and when my mother\nshakes me it's nearly dark. Your little brother is going to sleep a while. Nearly bit his tongue off. Stitches galore. Go into the other\nroom.\nMy father is in the kitchen sipping black tea from his big white\nenamel mug. He lifts me to his lap.\nDad, will you tell me the story about Coo Coo?\nCuchulain. Say it after me, Coo-hoo-lin. I'll tell you the story\nwhen you say the name right. Coo-hoo-lin.\nI say it right and he tells me the story of Cuchulain, who had a\ndifferent name when he was a boy, Setanta. He grew up in Ireland where Dad lived when he was a boy in County Antrim. Setanta had a stick and ball and one day he hit the ball and it went into the mouth of a big dog that belonged to Culain and choked him. Oh, Culain was angry and he said, What am I to do now without my big dog to guard my house and my wife and my ten small children as well as numerous pigs, hens, sheep?\nSetanta said, I'm sorry. I'll guard your house with my stick and ball and I'll change my name to Cuchulain, the Hound of Culain. He did. He guarded the house and regions beyond and became a great hero, the Hound of Ulster itself. Dad said he was a greater hero than Hercules or Achilles that the Greeks were always bragging about and he could take on King Arthur and all his knights in a fair fight which, of course, you could never get with an Englishman anyway.\nThat's my story. Dad can't tell that story to Malachy or any other children down the hall.\nHe finishes the story and lets me sip his tea. It's bitter, but I'm happy there on his lap.\nFor days Malachy's tongue is swollen and he can hardly make a sound never mind talk. But even if he could no one is paying any attention to him because we have two new babies who were brought by an angel in the middle of the night. The neighbors say, Ooh, Ah, they're lovely boys, look at those big eyes.\nMalachy stands in the middle of the room, looking up at everyone, pointing to his tongue and saying, Uck, uck. When the neighbors say, Can't you see we're looking at your little brothers? he cries, till Dad pats him on the head. Put in your tongue, son, and go out and play with Frankie. Go on.\nIn the playground I tell Malachy about the dog who died in the street because someone drove a ball into his mouth. Malachy shakes his head. No uck ball. Car uck kill dog. He cries because his tongue hurts and he can hardly talk and it's terrible when you can't talk. He won't let me push him on the swing. He says, You uck kill me uck on seesaw. He gets Freddie Leibowitz to push him and he's happy, laughing when he swings to the sky. Freddie is big, he's seven, and I ask him to push me. He says, No, you tried to kill your brother.\nI try to get the swing going myself but all I can do is move it back and forth and I'm angry because Freddie and Malachy are laughing at the way I can't swing. They're great pals now, Freddie, seven, Malachy, two. They laugh every day and Malachy's tongue gets better with all the laughing.\nWhen he laughs you can see how white and small and pretty his teeth are and you can see his eyes shine. He has blue eyes like my mother. He has golden hair and pink cheeks. I have brown eyes like Dad. I have black hair and my cheeks are white in the mirror. My mother tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall that Malachy is the happiest child in the world.\nShe tells Mrs. Leibowitz down the hall, Frankie has the odd manner like his father. I wonder what the odd manner is but I can't ask because I'm not supposed to be listening.\nI wish I could swing up into the sky, up into the clouds. I might be able to fly around the whole world and not hear my brothers, Oliver and Eugene, cry in the middle of the night anymore. My mother says they're always hungry. She cries in the middle of the night, too. She says she's worn out nursing and feeding and changing and four boys is too much for her. She wishes she had one little girl all for herself. She'd give anything for one little girl.\nI'm in the playground with Malachy. I'm four, he's three. He lets me push him on the swing because he's no good at swinging himself and Freddie Leibowitz is in school. We have to stay in the playground because the twins are sleeping and my mother says she's worn out. Go out and play, she says, and give me some rest. Dad is out looking for a job again and sometimes he comes home with the smell of whiskey, singing all the songs about suffering Ireland. Mam gets angry and says Ireland can kiss her arse. He says that's nice language to be using in front of the children and she says never mind the language, food on the table is what she wants, not suffering Ireland. She says it was a sad day Prohibition ended because Dad gets the drink going around to saloons offering to sweep out the bars and lift barrels for a whiskey or a beer. Sometimes he brings home bits of the free lunch, rye bread, corned beef, pickles. He puts the food on the table and drinks tea himself. He says food is a shock to the system and he doesn't know where we get our appetites. Mam\nsays,\nThey get their appetites because they're starving half the time.\nWhen Dad gets a job Mam is cheerful and she sings, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss,\nIt had to be and the reason is this\nCould it be true, someone like you\nCould love me, love me?\nWhen Dad brings home the first week's wages Mam is delighted she can pay the lovely Italian man in the grocery shop and she can hold her head up again because there's nothing worse in the world than to owe and be beholden to anyone. She cleans the kitchen, washes the mugs and plates, brushes crumbs and bits of food from the table, cleans out the icebox and orders a fresh block of ice from another Italian. She buys toilet paper that we can take down the hall to the lavatory and that, she says, is better than having the headlines from the Daily News blackening your arse. She boils water on the stove and spends a day at a great tin tub washing our shirts and socks, diapers for the twins, our two sheets, our three towels. She hangs everything out on the clotheslines behind the apartment house and we can watch the clothes dance in wind and sun. She says you wouldn't want the neighbors to know what you have in the way of a wash but there's nothing like the sweetness of clothes dried by the sun.\nWhen Dad brings home the first week's wages on a Friday night we know the weekend will be wonderful. On Saturday night Mam will boil water on the stove and wash us in the great tin tub and Dad will dry us. Malachy will turn around and show his behind. Dad will pretend to be shocked and we'll all laugh. Mam will make hot cocoa and we'll be able to stay up while Dad tells us a story out of his head. All we have to do is\nsay a name, Mr. MacAdorey or Mr. Leibowitz down the hall, and Dad will have the two of them rowing up a river in Brazil chased by Indians with green noses and puce shoulders. On nights like that we can drift off to sleep knowing there will be a breakfast of eggs, fried tomatoes and fried bread, tea with lashings of sugar and milk and, later in the day, a big dinner of mashed potatoes, peas and ham, and a trifle Mam makes, layers of fruit and warm delicious custard on a cake soaked in sherry.\nWhen Dad brings home the first week's wages and the weather is fine Mam takes us to the playground. She sits on a bench and talks to Minnie MacAdorey. She tells Minnie stories about characters in Limerick and Minnie tells her about characters in Belfast and they laugh because there are funny people in Ireland, North and South. Then they teach each other sad songs and Malachy and I leave the swings and see-saws to sit with them on the bench and sing, A group of young soldiers one night in a camp Were talking of sweethearts they had.\nAll seemed so merry except one young lad, And he was downhearted and sad.\nCome and join us, said one of the boys, Surely there's someone for you.\nBut Ned shook his head and proudly he said I am in love with two, Each like a mother to me,\nFrom neither of them shall I part.\nFor one is my mother,\nGod bless her and love her,\nThe other is my sweetheart.\nMalachy and I sing that song and Mam and Minnie laugh till they cry at the way Malachy takes a deep bow and holds his arms out to Mam at the end. Dan MacAdorey comes along on his way home from work and says Rudy Vallee better start worrying about the competition.\nWhen we go home Mam makes tea and bread and jam or mashed potatoes with butter and salt. Dad drinks the tea and eats nothing. Mam says, God above, How can you work all day and not eat? He says, The tea is enough. She says, You'll ruin your health, and he tells her again that food is a shock to the system. He drinks his tea and tells us stories and shows us letters and words in the Daily News or he smokes a cigarette, stares at the wall, runs his tongue over his lips.\nWhen Dad's job goes into the third week he does not bring home the wages. On Friday night we wait for him and Mam gives us bread and tea. The darkness comes down and the lights come on along Classon Avenue. Other men with jobs are home already and having eggs for dinner because you can't have meat on a Friday. You can hear the families talking upstairs and downstairs and down the hall and Bing Crosby is singing on the radio, Brother, can you spare a dime?\nMalachy and I play with the twins. We know Mam won't sing Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss. She sits at the kitchen table talking to herself, What am I going to do? till it's late and Dad rolls up the stairs singing Roddy McCorley. He pushes in the door and calls for us, Where are my troops? Where are my four warriors?\nMam says, Leave those boys alone. They're gone to bed half hungry because you have to fill your belly with whiskey.\nHe comes to the bedroom door. Up, boys, up. A nickel for everyone who promises to die for Ireland.\nDeep in Canadian woods we met\nFrom one bright island flown.\nGreat is the land we tread, but yet\nOur hearts are with our own.\nUp, boys, up. Francis, Malachy, Oliver, Eugene. The Red Branch Knights, the Fenian Men, the IRA. Up, up.\nMam is at the kitchen table, shaking, her hair hanging damp, her face wet. Can't you leave them alone? she says. Jesus, Mary and Joseph,\nisn't it enough that you come home without making fools of the children on top of it? She comes to us. Go back to bed, she\nI want them up, he says. I want them\nbe free from the center to the sea.\nDon't cross me, she says, for if you your mother's house.\na penny in your pocket without\nsays.\nready for the day Ireland will\ndo it'll be a sorry day in\nHe pulls his cap down over his face and cries, My poor mother. Poor Ireland. Och, what are we going to do?\nMam says, You're pure stone mad, and she tells us again to go to bed.\nOn the morning of the fourth Friday of Dad's job Mam asks him if he'll be home tonight with his wages or will he drink everything again? He looks at us and shakes his head at Mam as if to say, Och, you shouldn't talk like that in front of the children.\nMam keeps at him. I'm asking you, Are you coming home so that we can have a bit of supper or will it be midnight with no money in your pocket and you singing Kevin Barry and the rest of the sad songs?\nHe puts on his cap, shoves his hands into his trouser pockets, sighs and looks up at the ceiling. I told you before I'll be home, he\nsays.\nLater in the day Mam dresses us. She puts the twins into the pram\nand off we go through the long streets of Brooklyn. Sometimes she lets Malachy sit in the pram when he's tired of trotting along beside her. She tells me I'm too big for the pram. I could tell her I have pains in my legs from trying to keep up with her but she's not singing and I know this is not the day to be talking about my pains.\nWe come to a big gate where there's a man standing in a box with windows all around. Mam talks to the man. She wants to know if she can go inside to where the men are paid and maybe they'd give her some of Dad's wages so he wouldn't spend it in the bars. The man shakes his head. I'm sorry, lady, but if we did that we'd have half the wives in Brooklyn storming the place. Lotta men have the drinking problem but there's nothing we can do long as they show up sober and do their work.\nWe wait across the street. Mam lets me sit on the sidewalk with my back against the wall. She gives the twins their bottles of water and sugar but Malachy and I have to wait till she gets money from Dad and we can go to the Italian for tea and bread and eggs.\nWhen the whistle blows at half five men in caps and overalls swarm through the gate, their faces and hands black from the work. Mam tells us watch carefully for Dad because she can hardly see across the street\nherself, her eyes are that bad. There are dozens of men, then a few, then none. Mam is crying, Why couldn't ye see him? Are ye blind or what?\nShe goes back to the man in the box. Are you sure there wouldn't be one man left inside?\nNo, lady, he says. They're out. I don't know how he got past you.\nWe go back through the long streets of Brooklyn. The twins hold up their bottles and cry for more water and sugar. Malachy says he's hungry and Mam tells him wait a little, we'll get money from Dad and we'll all have a nice supper. We'll go to the Italian and get eggs and make toast with the flames on the stove and we'll have jam on it. Oh, we will, and we'll all be nice and warm.\nIt's dark on Atlantic Avenue and all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station are bright and noisy. We go from bar to bar looking for Dad. Mam leaves us outside with the pram while she goes in or she sends me. There are crowds of noisy men and stale smells that remind me of Dad when he comes home with the smell of the whiskey on him.\nThe man behind the bar says, Yeah, sonny, whaddya want? You're not supposeta be in here, y'know.\nI'm looking for my father. Is my father here?\nNaw, sonny, how'd I know dat? Who's your fawdah?\nHis name is Malachy and he sings Kevin Barry.\nMalarkey?\nNo, Malachy.\nMalachy? And he sings Kevin Barry?\nHe calls out to the men in the bar, Youse guys, youse know guy\nMalachy what sings Kevin Barry?\nMen shake their heads. One says he knew a guy Michael sang Kevin\nBarry but he died of the drink which he had because of his war wounds. The barman says, Jeez, Pete, I didn't ax ya to tell me history o'\nda woild, did I? Naw, kid. We don't let people sing in here. Causes trouble. Specially the Irish. Let 'em sing, next the fists are flying. Besides, I never hoid a name like dat Malachy. Naw, kid, no Malachy here.\nThe man called Pete holds his glass toward me. Here, kid, have a sip, but the barman says, Whaddya doin', Pete? Tryina get the kid drunk? Do that again, Pete, an' I'll come out an' break y'ass.\nMam tries all the bars around the station before she gives up. She leans against a wall and cries. Jesus, we still have to walk all the way to Classon Avenue and I have four starving children. She sends me back into the bar where Pete offered me the sip to see if the barman would fill the twins' bottles with water and maybe a little sugar in each. The men in the bar think it's very funny that the barman should be filling baby bottles but he's big and he tells them shut their lip. He tells me babies should be drinking milk not water and when I tell him Mam doesn't have the money he empties the baby bottles and fills them with milk. He says, Tell ya mom they need that for the teeth an' bones. Ya drink water an' sugar an' all ya get is rickets. Tell ya Mom.\nMam is happy with the milk. She says she knows all about teeth and bones and rickets but beggars can't be choosers.\nWhen we reach Classon Avenue she goes straight to the Italian grocery shop. She tells the man her husband is late tonight, that he's probably working overtime, and would it be at all possible to get a few things and she'll be sure to see him tomorrow?\nThe Italian says, Missus, you always pay your bill sooner or later and you can have anything you like in this store.\nOh, she says, I don't want much.\nAnything you like, missus, because I know you're an honest woman and you got a bunch o' nice kids there.\nWe have eggs and toast and jam though we're so weary walking the long streets of Brooklyn we can barely move our jaws to chew. The twins fall asleep after eating and Mam lays them on the bed to change their diapers. She sends me down the hall to rinse the dirty diapers in the lavatory so that they can be hung up to dry and used the next day. Malachy helps her wash the twins' bottoms though he's ready to fall asleep himself.\nI crawl into bed with Malachy and the twins. I look out at Mam at the kitchen table, smoking a cigarette, drinking tea, and crying. I want to get up and tell her I'll be a man soon and I'll get a job in the place with the big gate and I'll come home every Friday night with money for eggs and toast and jam and she can sing again Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss.\nThe next week Dad loses the job. He comes home that Friday night, throws his wages on the table and says to Mam, Are you happy now? You hang around the gate complaining and accusing and they sack me. They were looking for an excuse and you gave it to them.\nHe takes a few dollars from his wages and goes out. He comes home late roaring and singing. The twins cry and Mam shushes them and cries a long time herself.\nWe spend hours in the playground when the twins are sleeping, when Mam is tired, and when Dad comes home with the whiskey smell on him, roaring about Kevin Barry getting hanged on a Monday morning or the Roddy McCorley song, Up the narrow street he stepped Smiling and proud and young About the hemp rope on his neck The golden ringlets clung, There's never a tear in the blue eyes Both glad and bright are they, As Roddy McCorley goes to die On the bridge of Toome today.\nWhen he sings he marches around the table, Mam cries and the twins howl with her. She says, Go out, Frankie, go out, Malachy. You shouldn't see your father like this. Stay in the playground. We don't mind going to the playground.\nWe can play with the leaves piling up on the ground and we can push each other on the swings but then winter comes to Classon Avenue and the swings are frozen and won't even move. Minnie MacAdorey says, God help these poor wee boys.\nThey don't have a glove between them. That makes me laugh because I know Malachy and I have four hands between us and one glove would be silly. Malachy doesn't know what I'm laughing at: He won't know anything till he's four going on five.\nMinnie brings us in and gives us tea and porridge with jam in it. Mr. MacAdorey sits in an armchair with their new baby, Maisie. He holds her bottle and sings, Clap hands, clap hands, Till Daddy comes home, With buns in his pocket For Maisie alone.\nClap hands, clap hands,\nTill Daddy comes home,\nFor Daddy has money\nAnd Mammy has none.\nMalachy tries to sing that song but I tell him stop, it's Maisie's song. He starts to cry and Minnie says, There, there. You can sing the\nsong.\nand I\nsong.\nThat's a song for all the children. Mr. MacAdorey smiles at Malachy wonder what kind of world is it where anyone can sing anyone else's\nMinnie says, Don't frown, Frankie. It makes your face dark and God it's dark enough. Some day you'll have a little sister and you can\nknows\nsing that song to her. Och, aye. You'll have a little sister, surely.\nMinnie is right and Mam gets her wish. There's a new baby soon, a little girl, and they call her Margaret. We all love Margaret. She has black curly hair and blue eyes like Mam and she waves her little hands and chirps like any little bird in the trees along Classon Avenue. Minnie says there was a holiday in heaven the day this child was made. Mrs. Leibowitz says the world never saw such eyes, such a smile, such happiness. She makes me dance, says Mrs. Leibowitz.\nsings\nWhen Dad comes home from looking for a job he holds Margaret and to her: In a shady nook one moonlit night A leprechaun I spied.\nWith scarlet cap and coat of green\nA cruiskeen by his side.\n'Twas tick tock tick his hammer went Upon a tiny shoe.\nOh, I laugh to think he was caught at last, But the fairy was laughing, too.\nHe walks around the kitchen with her and talks to her. He tells her how lovely she is with her curly black hair and the blue eyes of her mother. He tells her he'll take her to Ireland and they'll walk the Glens of Antrim and swim in Lough Neagh. He'll get a job soon, so he will, and she'll have dresses of silk and shoes with silver buckles.\nThe more Dad sings to Margaret the less she cries and as the days pass she even begins to laugh. Mam says, Look at him trying to dance with that child in his arms, him with his two left feet. She laughs and we all laugh.\nThe twins cried when they were small and Dad and Mam would say Whisht and Hush and feed them and they'd go back to sleep. But when Margaret cries there's a high lonely feeling in the air and Dad is out of bed in a second, holding her to him, doing a slow dance around the table, singing to her, making sounds like a mother. When he passes the window where the streetlight shines in you can see tears on his cheeks and that's strange because he never cries for anyone unless he has the drink taken and he sings the Kevin Barry song and the Roddy McCorley song. Now he cries over Margaret and he has no smell of drink on him.\nMam tells Minnie MacAdorey, He's in heaven over that child. He hasn't touched a drop since she was born. I should've had a little girl a long time ago.\nOch, they're lovely, aren't they? says Minnie. The little boys are grand, too, but you need a little girl for yourself.\nMy mother laughs, For myself? Lord above, if I didn't nurse her I wouldn't be able to get near her the way he wants to be holding her day and night.\nMinnie says it's lovely, all the same, to see a man so charmed with his little girl for isn't everyone charmed with her?\nEveryone.\nThe twins are able to stand and walk and they have accidents all the time. Their bottoms are sore because they're always wet and shitty. They put dirty things in their mouths, bits of paper, feathers, shoelaces, and they get sick. Mam says we're all driving her crazy. She dresses the twins, puts them in the pram, and Malachy and I take them to the playground. The cold weather is gone and the trees have green leaves up and down Classon Avenue.\nWe race the pram around the playground and the twins laugh and make goo-goo sounds till they get hungry and start to cry. There are two bottles in the pram filled with water and sugar and that keeps them quiet for awhile till they're hungry again and they cry so hard I don't know what to do because they're so small and I wish I could give them all kinds of food so that they'd laugh and make the baby sounds. They love the mushy food Mam makes in a pot, bread mashed up in milk and water and sugar. Mam calls it bread and goody.\nIf I take the twins home now Mam will yell at me for giving her no rest or for waking Margaret. We are to stay in the playground till she sticks her head out the window and calls for us. I make funny faces for the twins to stop their crying. I put a piece of paper on my head and let it fall and they laugh and laugh. I push the pram over to Malachy playing on the swings with Freddie Leibowitz. Malachy is trying to tell Freddie all about the way Setanta became Cuchulain. I tell him stop telling that story, it's my story. He won't stop. I push him and he cries, Waah, waah, I'll tell Mam. Freddie pushes me and everything turns dark in my head and I run at him with fists and knees and feet till he yells, Hey, stop, stop, and I won't because I can't, I don't know how, and if I stop Malachy will go on taking my story from me. Freddie pushes me away and runs off, yelling, Frankie tried to kill me. Frankie tried to kill me. I don't know what to do because I never tried to kill anyone before and now Malachy, on the swing, cries, Don't kill me, Frankie, and he looks so helpless I put my arms around him and help him off the swing. He hugs me. I won't tell your story anymore. I won't tell Freddie about Coo, Coo. I want to laugh but I can't because the twins are crying in the pram and it's dark in the playground and what's the use of trying to make funny faces and letting things fall off your head when they can't see you in the dark?\nThe Italian grocery shop is across the street and I see bananas, apples, oranges. I know the twins can eat bananas. Malachy loves bananas and I like them myself. But you need money, Italians are not known for giving away bananas especially to the McCourts who owe them money already for groceries.\nMy mother tells me all the time, Never, never leave that playground except to come home. But what am I to do with the twins bawling with the hunger in the pram? I tell Malachy I'll be back in a minute. I make sure no one is looking, grab a bunch of bananas outside the Italian grocery shop and run down Myrtle Avenue, away from the playground, around the block and back to the other end where there's a hole in the fence. We push the pram to a dark corner and peel the bananas for the twins. There are five bananas in the bunch and we feast on them in the dark corner. The twins slobber and chew and spread banana over their faces, their hair, their clothes. I realize then that questions will be asked. Mam will want to know why the twins are smothered in bananas, where did you get them? I can't tell her about the Italian shop on the corner. I will have to say, A man.\nThat's what I'll say. A man.\nThen the strange thing happens. There's a man at the gate of the playground. He's calling me. Oh, God, it's the Italian. Hey, sonny, come 'ere. Hey, talkin' to ya. Come 'ere.\nI go to him.\nYou the kid wid the little bruddas, right? Twins?\nYes, sir.\nHeah. Gotta bag o' fruit. I don' give it to you I trow id out.\nRight? So, heah, take the bag. Ya got apples, oranges, bananas. Ya like bananas, right? I think ya like bananas, eh? Ha, ha. I know ya like the bananas. Heah, take the bag. Ya gotta nice mother there. Ya father? Well, ya know, he's got the problem, the Irish thing. Give them twins a banana. Shud 'em up. I hear 'em all the way cross the street.\nThank you, sir.\nJeez. Polite kid, eh? Where ja loin dat?\nMy father told me to say thanks, sir.\nYour father? Oh, well.\nDad sits at the table reading the paper. He says that President\nRoosevelt is a good man and everyone in America will soon have a job. Mam is on the other side of the table feeding Margaret with a bottle. She has the hard look that frightens me.\nWhere did you get that fruit?\nThe man.\nWhat man?\nThe Italian man gave it to me.\nDid you steal that fruit?\nMalachy says, The man. The man\nAnd what did you do to Freddie\nLovely woman. I don't know what we'd\nAnd you had to attack poor Freddie.\ngave Frankie the bag.\nLeibowitz? His mother was here.\ndo without her and Minnie MacAdorey.\nMalachy jumps up and down. He din't. He din't. Din't try to kill Freddie. Din't try to kill me.\nDad says, Whisht, Malachy, whisht. Come over here. And he takes Malachy on his lap.\nMy mother says, Go down the hall and tell Freddie you're sorry.\nBut Dad says, Do you want to tell Freddie you're sorry?\nI don't.\nMy parents look at one another. Dad says, Freddie is a good boy. He\nwas only pushing your little brother on the swing. Isn't that right? He was trying to steal my Cuchulain story.\nOch, now. Freddie doesn't care about the Cuchulain story. He has\nhis own story. Hundreds of stories. He's Jewish. What's Jewish?\nDad laughs. Jewish is, Jewish is people with their own stories. They don't need Cuchulain. They have Moses. They have Samson.\nWhat's Samson?\nIf you go down and talk to Freddie I'll tell you about Samson later. You can tell Freddie you're sorry and you'll never do it again and you can even ask him about Samson. Anything you like as long as you talk to Freddie. Will you?\nThe baby gives a little cry in my mother's arms and Dad jumps up, dropping Malachy to the floor. Is she all right? My mother says, Of course she's all right. She's feeding. God above, you're a bundle of nerves.\nThey're talking about Margaret now and I'm forgotten. I don't care. I'm going down the hall to ask Freddie about Samson, to see if Samson is as good as Cuchulain, to see if Freddie has his own story or if he still wants to steal Cuchulain. Malachy wants to go with me now that my father is standing and doesn't have a lap anymore.\nMrs. Leibowitz says, Oh, Frankie, Frankie, come in, come in. And little Malachy. And tell me, Frankie, what did you do to Freddie? Tried to kill him? Freddie is a good boy, Frankie. Reads his book. Listens to radio with his papa. He swinks you brother on swink. And you try to kill him. Oh, Frankie, Frankie. And you poor mother and her sick baby.\nShe's not sick, Mrs. Leibowitz.\nSick she is. Zat is one sick baby. I know from sick babies. I work in hoztipal. Don't tell me, Frankie. Come in, come in. Freddie, Freddie, Frankie is here. Come out. Frankie won't kill you no more. You and little Malachy. Nice Chewish name, have piece cake, eh? Why they give you a Chewish name, eh? So, glass milk, piece cake. You boys so thin, Irish don't eat.\nWe sit at the table with Freddie, eating cake, drinking milk. Mr. Leibowitz sits in an armchair reading the paper, listening to the radio. Sometimes he speaks to Mrs. Leibowitz and I don't understand because strange sounds come from his mouth. Freddie understands. When Mr. Leibowitz makes the strange sounds Freddie gets up and takes him a piece of cake. Mr. Leibowitz smiles at Freddie and pats his head and Freddie smiles back and makes the strange sounds.\nMrs. Leibowitz shakes her head at Malachy and me. Oy, so thin. She says Oy so much Malachy laughs and says Oy and the Leibowitzes laugh and Mr. Leibowitz says words we can understand, When Irish oyes are smiling. Mrs. Leibowitz laughs so hard her body shakes and she holds her stomach and Malachy says Oy again because he knows that makes everyone laugh. I say Oy but no one laughs and I know Oy belongs to Malachy the way Cuchulain belongs to me and Malachy can have his Oy.\nMrs. Leibowitz, my father said Freddie has a favorite story.\nMalachy says, Sam, Sam, Oy. Everyone laughs again but I don't because I can't remember what comes after Sam. Freddie mumbles through his cake, Samson, and Mrs. Leibowitz tells him, Don't talk wiz you mouse full, and I laugh because she's grown-up and she says mouse instead of mouth. Malachy laughs because I laugh and the Leibowitzes look at each other and smile. Freddie says, Not Samson. My favorite story is David and the giant, Goliath. David killed him dead with a slingshot, a stone in his head. His brains was on the ground.\nWere on the ground, says Mr. Leibowitz.\nYes, Papa. Papa.\nThat's what Freddie calls his father and Dad is what I call my\nfather.\nMy mother's whisper wakes me. What's up with the child? It's still\nearly and there isn't much morning in the room but you can see Dad over by the window with Margaret in his arms. He's rocking her and sighing,\nOch.\nMam says, Is she, is she sick?\nOch, she's very quiet and she's a wee bit cold.\nMy mother is out of the bed, taking the child. Go for the doctor.\nGo for God's sake, and my father is pulling on his trousers over his shirt, no jacket, shoes, no socks on this bitter day.\nWe wait in the room, the twins asleep at the bottom of the bed, Malachy stirring beside me. Frankie, I want a drink of water. Mam rocks in her bed with the baby in her arms. Oh, Margaret, Margaret, my own little love. Open your lovely blue eyes, my little leanv.\nI fill a cup of water for Malachy and me and my mother wails, Water for you and your brother. Oh, indeed, Water, is it? And nothing for your sister. Your poor little sister. Did you ask if she had a mouth in her head? Did you ask if she'd like a drop of water? Oh, no. Go on and drink your water, you and your brother, as if nothing happened. A regular day for the two of you, isn't it? And the twins sleeping away as if they didn't have a care and their poor little sister sick here in my arms. Sick in my arms. Oh, sweet Jesus in heaven.\nWhy is she talking like this? She's not talking like my mother today. I want my father. Where is my father?\nI get back into bed and start to cry. Malachy says, Why you cry? Why you cry? till Mam is at me again. Your sister is sick in my arms and you're there whining and whinging. If I go over to that bed I'll give you something to whinge about.\nDad is back with the doctor. Dad has the whiskey smell. The doctor examines the baby, prods her, raises her eyelids, feels her neck, arms, legs. He straightens up and shakes his head. She's gone. Mam reaches for the baby, hugs her, turns to the wall. The doctor wants to know, Was there any kind of accident? Did anyone drop the baby? Did the boys play too hard with her? Anything?\nMy father shakes his head. Doctor says he'll have to take her to examine her and Dad signs a paper. My mother begs for another few minutes with her baby but the doctor says he doesn't have all day. When Dad reaches for Margaret my mother pulls away against the wall. She has the wild look, her black curly hair is damp on her forehead and there is sweat all over her face, her eyes are wide open and her face is shiny with tears, she keeps shaking her head and moaning, Ah, no, ah, no, till Dad eases the baby from her arms. The doctor wraps Margaret completely in a blanket and my mother cries, Oh, Jesus, you'll smother her. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me. The doctor leaves. My mother turns to the wall and doesn't make a move or sound. The twins are awake, crying with the hunger, but Dad stands in the middle of the room, staring at the ceiling. His face is white and he beats on his thighs with his fists. He comes to the bed, puts his hand on my head. His hand is shaking. Francis, I'm going out for cigarettes.\nMam stays in the bed all day, hardly moving. Malachy and I fill the twins' bottles with water and sugar. In the kitchen we find a half loaf of stale bread and two cold sausages. We can't have tea because the milk is sour in the icebox where the ice is melted again and everyone knows you can't drink tea without milk unless your father gives it to you out of his mug while he's telling you about Cuchulain.\nThe twins are hungry again but I know I can't give them water and sugar all day and night. I boil sour milk in a pot, mash in some of the stale bread, and try to feed them from a cup, bread and goody. They make faces and run to Mam's bed, crying. She keeps her face to the wall and they run back to me, still crying. They won't eat the bread and goody till I kill the taste of the sour milk with sugar. Now they eat and smile and rub the goody over their faces. Malachy wants some and if he can eat it, so can I. We all sit on the floor eating the goody and chewing on the\ncold sausage and drinking water my mother keeps in a milk bottle in the icebox.\nAfter we eat and drink we have to go to the lavatory down the hall but we can't get in because Mrs. Leibowitz is inside, humming and singing. She says, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Won't be two seconds. Malachy claps his hands and dances around, singing, Wait, chiltren, wait, darlinks. Mrs. Leibowitz opens the lavatory door. Look at him. Little actor awready. So, chiltren, how's you mother?\nShe's in bed, Mrs. Leibowitz. The doctor took Margaret and my father went for cigarettes.\nOh, Frankie, Frankie. I said that was one sick child.\nMalachy is clutching himself. Have to pee. Have to pee.\nSo, pee awready. You boys pee and we see you mother.\nAfter we pee Mrs. Leibowitz comes to see Mam. Oh, Mrs. McCourt. Oy\nvey, darlink. Look at this. Look at these twins. Naked. Mrs. McCourt, what is mazzer, eh? The baby she is sick? So talk to me. Poor woman. Here turn around, missus. Talk to me. Oy, this is one mess. Talk to me, Mrs. McCourt.\nShe helps my mother sit up against the wall. Mam seems smaller. Mrs. Leibowitz says she'll bring some soup and tells me get some water to wash my mother's face. I dip a towel in cold water and pat her forehead. She presses my hand against her cheeks. Oh, Jesus, Frankie. Oh, Jesus. She won't let my hand go and I'm frightened because I've never seen her like this before. She's saying Frankie only because it's my hand she's holding and it's Margaret she's thinking about, not me. Your lovely little sister is dead, Frankie. Dead. And where is your father? She lets my hand drop. I said where is your father? Drinking. That's where he is. There isn't a penny in the house. He can't get a job but he finds money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink, money for the drink. She rears back, knocks her head on the wall and screams, Where is she? Where is she? Where is my little girl? Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, help me this night. I'll go mad, so I will, I'll go pure mad.\nMrs. Leibowitz rushes in. Missus, missus, what is it? The little girl. Where is she?\nMy mother screams again, Dead, Mrs. Leibowitz. Dead. Her head drops and she rocks back and forth. Middle of the night, Mrs. Leibowitz. In her pram. I should have been watching her. Seven weeks she had in this world and died in the middle of the night, alone, Mrs. Leibowitz, all alone in that pram.\nMrs. Leibowitz holds my mother in her arms. Shush, now, shush. Babies go like that. It happens, missus. God takes them.\nIn the pram, Mrs. Leibowitz. Near my bed. I could have picked her up and she didn't have to die, did she? God doesn't want little babies. What is God going to do with little babies?\nI don't know, missus. I don't know from God. Have soup. Good soup. Make you strong. You boys. Get bowls. I give you soup.\nWhat's bowls, Mrs. Leibowitz?\nOh, Frankie. You don't know bowl? For the soup, darlink. You don' have a bowl? So get cups for the soup. I mix pea soup and lentil soup. No ham. Irish like the ham. No ham, Frankie. Drink, missus. Drink you soup.\nShe spoons the soup into my mother's mouth, wipes the dribble from her chin. Malachy and I sit on the floor drinking from mugs. We spoon the soup into the twins' mouths. It is lovely and hot and tasty. My mother never makes soup like this and I wonder if there's any chance Mrs.\nLeibowitz could ever be my mother. Freddie could be me and have my mother and my father, too, and he could have Malachy and the twins for brothers. He can't have Margaret anymore because she's like the dog in the street that was taken away. I don't know why she was taken away. My mother said she died in her pram and that must be like getting hit by a car because they take you away.\nI wish little Margaret could be here for the soup. I could give it to her with a spoon the way Mrs. Leibowitz is giving it to my mother and she'd gurgle and laugh the way she did with Dad. She wouldn't cry anymore and my mother wouldn't be in the bed day and night and Dad would be telling me Cuchulain stories and I wouldn't want Mrs. Leibowitz to be my mother anymore. Mrs. Leibowitz is nice but I'd rather have my father telling me Cuchulain stories and Margaret chirping and Mam laughing when Dad dances with two left feet.\nMinnie MacAdorey comes in to help. Mother o' God, Mrs. Leibowitz, these twins smell to the high heavens.\nI don't know about Mother o' God, Minnie, but these twins need a wash. They need clean diapers. Frankie, where are the clean diapers?\nI don't know.\nMinnie says, They're just wearing rags for diapers. I'll get some of Maisie's. Frankie, you take off those rags and throw them out.\nMalachy removes Oliver's rag and I struggle with Eugene. The safety pin is stuck and when he wriggles it comes loose, sticks him in the hip, and starts him screaming for Mam. But Minnie is back with a towel and soap and hot water. I help her wash away the caked shit and she lets me shake talcum powder on the twins' raw sore skin. She says they're good little boys and she has a big surprise for them. She goes down the hall and brings back a pot of mashed potatoes for all of us. There is plenty of salt and butter in the potatoes and I wonder if there's any chance Minnie could be my mother so that I could eat like this all the time. If I could have Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie for mothers at the same time I'd have no end of soup and mashed potatoes.\nMinnie and Mrs. Leibowitz sit at the table. Mrs. Leibowitz says something has to be done. These children are running wild and where is the father? I hear Minnie whisper he's out for the drink. Mrs. Leibowitz says terrible, terrible, the way the Irish drink. Minnie says her Dan doesn't drink. Never touches the stuff and Dan told her that when the baby died that poor man, Malachy McCourt, went mad all over Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue, that he was thrown out of all the bars around the Long Island Railroad Station, that the cops would have thrown him in jail if it was anything else but the death of that lovely little baby.\nHere he has four lovely little boys, says Minnie, but it's no comfort to him. That little girl brought out something in him. You know he didn't even drink after she was born and that was a miracle.\nMrs. Leibowitz wants to know where Mam's cousins are, the big women with the quiet husbands. Minnie will find them and tell them the children are neglected, running wild, sore arses and everything.\nTwo days later Dad returns from his cigarette hunt. It's the middle of the night but he gets Malachy and me out of the bed. He has the smell of the drink on him. He has us stand at attention in the kitchen. We are soldiers. He tells us we must promise to die for Ireland.\nWe will, Dad, we will.\nAll together we sing Kevin Barry,\nOn Mountjoy one Monday morning,\nHigh upon the gallows tree,\nKevin Barry gave his young life\nFor the cause of liberty.\nJust a lad of eighteen summers\nSure there's no one can deny\nAs he marched to death that morning\nHow he held his head on high.\nThere's a knock at the door, Mr. MacAdorey. Och, Malachy, for God's sake, it's three in the morning. You have the whole house woke with the singing.\nOch, Dan, I'm only teaching the boys to die for Ireland.\nYou can teach them to die for Ireland in the daytime, Malachy. 'Tis urgent, Dan, 'tis urgent.\nI know, Malachy, but they're only children. Babies. You go to bed\nnow like a dacent man.\nBed, Dan! What am I to do in bed? Her little face is there day and\nnight, her curly black hair and her lovely blue eyes. Oh, Jesus, Dan, what will I do? Was it the hunger that killed her, Dan?\nOf course not. Your missus was nursing her. God took her. He has his reasons.\nOne more song, Dan, before we go to bed. Good night, Malachy.\nCome on, boys. Sing.\nBecause he loved the motherland, Because he loved the green\nHe goes to meet a martyr's fate With proud and joyous mien;\nTrue to the last, oh! true to the last He treads the upward way;\nYoung Roddy McCorley goes to die\nOn the bridge at Toome today.\nYou'll die for Ireland, won't you, boys?\nWe will, Dad.\nAnd we'll all meet your little sister in heaven, won't we, boys? We will, Dad.\nMy brother is standing with his face pressed against a leg of the\ntable and he's asleep. Dad lifts him, staggers across the room, places him in the bed by my mother. I climb into bed and my father, still in his clothes, lies beside me. I'm hoping he'll put his arms around me but he goes on singing about Roddy McCorley and talking to Margaret, Oh, my little curly-haired, blue-eyed love, I would dress you in silks and take you to Lough Neagh, till day is at the window and I fall asleep.\nThat night Cuchulain comes to me. There's a big green bird on his shoulder that keeps singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley and I don't like that bird because there's blood dripping from his mouth when he sings. In one hand Cuchulain carries the gae bolga, the spear that is so mighty only he can throw it. In the other hand he carries a banana, which he keeps offering to the bird, who just squawks and spits blood at\nhim. You'd wonder why Cuchulain puts up with a bird like that. If the twins ever spat blood at me when I offered them a banana I think I'd hit them on the head with it.\nIn the morning my father is at the kitchen table and I tell him my dream. He says there were no bananas in Ireland in the old times and even if there were Cuchulain would never offer one to that bird because that was the one that came over from England for the summer and perched on his shoulder when he was dying and propped up against a stone and when the men of Erin which is Ireland wanted to kill him they were afraid till they saw the bird drinking Cuchulain's blood and then they knew it was safe to attack him, the dirty bloody cowards. So you have to be wary of birds, Francis, birds and Englishmen.\nMost of the day Mam lies in bed with her face to the wall. If she drinks tea or eats anything she throws up in the bucket under the bed and I have to empty it and rinse it in the lavatory down the hall. Mrs. Leibowitz brings her soup and funny bread that is twisted. Mam tries to slice it but Mrs. Leibowitz laughs and tells her just pull. Malachy calls it pull bread but Mrs. Leibowitz says, No, it's challah, and teaches us how to say it. She shakes her head. Oy, you Irish. You'll live forever but you'll never say challah like a Chew.\nMinnie MacAdorey brings potatoes and cabbage and sometimes a piece of meat. Och, times are hard, Angela, but that lovely man, Mr. Roosevelt, will find a job for everyone and your husband will have work. Poor man, it's not his fault there's a Depression. He looks for work day and night. My Dan is lucky, four years with the city and he don't drink. He grew up in Toome with your husband. Some drink. Some don't. Curse of the Irish. Now eat, Angela. Build yourself up after your loss.\nMr. MacAdorey tells Dad there's work with the WPA and when he gets the work there's money for food and Mam leaves the bed to clean the twins and to feed us. When Dad comes home with the drink smell there's no money and Mam screams at him till the twins cry, and Malachy and I run out to the playground. On those nights Mam crawls back into bed and Dad sings the sad songs about Ireland. Why doesn't he hold her and help her sleep the way he did with my little sister who died? Why doesn't he sing a Margaret song or a song that will dry Mam's tears? He still gets Malachy and me out of bed to stand in our shirts promising to die for Ireland. One night he wanted to make the twins promise to die for Ireland but they can't even talk and Mam screamed at him, You mad oul' bastard, can't you leave the children alone?\nHe'll give us a nickel for ice cream if we promise to die for Ireland and we promise but we never get the nickel.\nWe get soup from Mrs. Leibowitz and mashed potatoes from Minnie MacAdorey and they show us how to take care of the twins, how to wash their bottoms and how to wash diaper rags after they get them all shitty. Mrs. Leibowitz calls them diapers and Minnie calls them nappies but it doesn't matter what they call them because the twins get them shitty anyway. If Mam stays in the bed and Dad goes out looking for a job we can do what we like all day. We can put the twins in the small swings in the park and swing them till they get hungry and cry. The Italian man calls to me from across the street, Hey, Frankie, c'mere. Watch out crossing da street. Dem twins hungry again? He gives us bits of cheese and ham and bananas but I can't eat bananas anymore after the way the bird spat blood at Cuchulain.\nThe man says his name is Mr. Dimino and that's his wife, Angela, behind the counter. I tell him that's my mother's name. No kiddin', kid. Your mother is Angela? I didn't know the Irish had any Angelas. Hey, Angela, his mother's name is Angela. She smiles. She says, Thatsa nice.\nMr. Dimino asks me about Mam and Dad and who cooks for us. I tell him we get food from Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. I tell him all about the diapers and the nappies and how they get shitty anyway and he laughs. Angela, you listenin' to this? Thank God you're Italian, Angela. He says, Kid, I gotta talk to Mrs. Leibowitz. Ya gotta have relations can take care of you. Ya see Minnie MacAdorey, tell her come in see me. You kids runnin' wild.\nTwo big women are at the door. They say, Who are you? I'm Frank. Frank! How old are you?\nI'm four going on five.\nYou're not very big for your age, are you?\nI don't know.\nIs your mother here?\nShe's in the bed.\nWhat is she doing in the bed on a fine day in the middle of the\nday?\nShe's sleeping. Well, we'll come in. We have to talk to your\nmother.\nThey brush past me into the room. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, the smell\nof this place. And who are these children?\nMalachy runs smiling to the big women. When he smiles you can see\nhow white and straight and pretty his teeth are and you can see the shiny blue of his eyes, the pink of his cheeks. All that makes the big women smile and I wonder why they didn't smile when they talked to me.\nMalachy says, I'm Malachy and this is Oliver and this is Eugene, they're twins, and that's Frankie over there.\nThe big woman with the brown hair says, Well, you're not a bit shy, are you? I'm your mother's cousin, Philomena, and this is your mother's cousin, Delia. I'm Mrs. Flynn and she's Mrs. Fortune and that's what you call us.\nGood God, says Philomena. Those twins are naked. Don't you have clothes for them?\nMalachy says, They're all shitty.\nDelia barks. See. That's what happens. A mouth like a sewer, and no wonder with a father from the North. Don't use that word. That's a bad word, a curse word. You could go to hell using a word like that.\nWhat's hell? says Malachy. You'll know soon enough, says Delia.\nThe big women sit at the table with Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey. Philomena says it's terrible what happened to Angela's little baby. They heard all about it and you'd wonder, wouldn't you, what they did with the little body. You might wonder and I might wonder but Tommy Flynn didn't wonder. Tommy said that Malachy from the North got money for that baby. Money? says Mrs. Leibowitz. That's right, says Philomena. Money. They take bodies any age and do experiments on them and there's not much left to give back nor would you want back bits of baby when they can't be buried in consecrated ground in that condition.\nThat's terrible, says Mrs. Leibowitz. A father or mother would never give the baby for something like that.\nThey would, says Delia, when they have the craving for the drink. They'd give their own mothers when they have the craving so what's a baby that's dead and gone in the first place?\nMrs. Leibowitz shakes her head and rocks in her chair. Oy, she says, oy, oy, oy. The poor baby. The poor mother. I thank God my husband don'have no what you call it? Craving? Right, craving. It's the Irish have the craving.\nNot my husband, says Philomena. I'd break his face if he came home with the craving. Of course, Delia's Jimmy has the craving. Every Friday night you see him slipping into the saloon.\nYou needn't start insulting my Jimmy, says Delia. He works. He brings home his wages.\nYou'd want to keep an eye on him, says Philomena. The craving could get the better of him and you'd have another Malachy from the North on your hands.\nMind your own bloody business, says Delia. At least Jimmy is Irish, not born in Brooklyn like your Tommy.\nAnd Philomena has no answer for that.\nMinnie is holding her baby and the big women say she's a lovely baby, clean, not like this pack of Angela's running around this place. Philomena says she doesn't know where Angela got her dirty habits because Angela's mother was spotless, so clean you could eat your dinner off her floor.\nI wonder why you'd want to eat your dinner off the floor when you had a table and a chair.\nDelia says something has to be done about Angela and these children for they are a disgrace, so they are, enough to make you ashamed to be related. A letter has to be written to Angela's mother. Philomena will write it because a teacher in Limerick told her once she had a fine fist. Delia has to tell Mrs. Leibowitz that a fine fist means good handwriting.\nMrs. Leibowitz goes down the hall to borrow her husband's fountain pen, paper and an envelope. The four women sit at the table and make up a letter to send to my mother's mother: Dear Aunt Margaret, I take pen in hand to write you this letter and hope this finds you as it leaves us in the best of health. My husband Tommy is in fine form working away and Delia's husband Jimmy is in fine form working away and we hope this finds you in fine form. I am very sorry to tell you that Angela is not in fine form as the baby died, the little girl that was called Margaret after yourself, and Angela has not been the same since lying in the bed with her face to the wall. To make matters worser we think she's expecting again and that's too much altogether. The minute she losses one child there is another one on the way. We don't know how she does it. She's married four years, five children and another on the way. That shows you what can happen when you marry someone from the North for they have no control over themselves up there a bunch of Protestands that they are. He goes out for work every day but we know he spends all his time in the saloons and gets a few dollars for sweeping floors and lifting barrels and spends the money right back on the drink. It's terrible, Aunt Margaret, and we all think Angela and the children would be better off in her native land. We don't have the money to buy the tickets ourselves for times is hard but you might be able to see your way. Hopping this finds you in fine form as it leaves us thank God and His Blessed Mother.\nI remain your loving neice\nPhilomena Flynn (what was MacNamara) and last but not least your neice Delia Fortune (what was MacNamara, too, ha ha ha)\nGrandma Sheehan sent money to Philomena and Delia. They bought the tickets, found a steamer trunk at the St. Vincent de Paul Society, hired a van to take us to the pier in Manhattan, put us on the ship, said Good- bye and good riddance, and went away.\nThe ship pulled away from the dock. Mam said, That's the Statue of Liberty and that's Ellis Island where all the immigrants came in. Then she leaned over the side and vomited and the wind from the Atlantic blew it all over us and other happy people admiring the view. Passengers cursed and ran, seagulls came from all over the harbor and Mam hung limp and pale on the ship's rail.\nII\nIn a week we arrived at Moville, County Donegal, where we took a bus to Belfast and from there another bus to Toome in County Antrim. We left the trunk in a shop and set out to walk the two miles up the road to Grandpa McCourt's house. It was dark on the road, the dawn barely stirring on the hills beyond.\nDad carried the twins in his arms and they took turns crying with the hunger. Mam stopped every few minutes to sit and rest on the stone wall along the road. We sat with her and watched the sky turn red and then blue. Birds started to chirp and sing in the trees and as the dawn came up we saw strange creatures in the fields, standing, looking at us. Malachy said, What are they, Dad?\nCows, son.\nWhat are cows, Dad?\nCows are cows, son.\nWe walked farther along the brightening road and there were other\ncreatures in the fields, white furry creatures. Malachy said, What are they, Dad?\nSheep, son.\nWhat are sheep, Dad?\nMy father barked at him, Is there any end to your questions? Sheep are sheep, cows are cows, and that over there is a goat. A goat is a goat. The goat gives milk, the sheep gives wool, the cow gives everything. What else in God's name do you want to know?\nAnd Malachy yelped with fright because Dad never talked like that, never spoke sharply to us. He might get us up in the middle of the night and make us promise to die for Ireland but he never barked like this. Malachy ran to Mam and she said, There, there, love, don't cry. Your father is just worn out carrying the twins and 'tis hard answering all those questions when you're carting twins through the world.\nDad set the twins on the road and held out his arms to Malachy. Now the twins started to cry and Malachy clung to Mam, sobbing. The cows mooed, the sheep maaed, the goat ehehed, the birds twittered in the trees, and the beep beep of a motor car cut through everything. A man called from the motor car, Good Lord, what are you people doing on this road at this hour of an Easter Sunday morning?\nDad said, Good morning, Father.\nFather? I said. Dad, is that your father?\nMam said, Don't ask him any questions.\nDad said, No, no, this is a priest.\nMalachy said, What's a-? but Mam put her hand over his mouth. The priest had white hair and a white collar. He said, Where are\nyou going?\nDad said, Up the road to McCourts of Moneyglass, and the priest\ntook us in his motor car. He said he knew the McCourts, a fine family, good Catholics, some daily communicants, and he hoped he'd see us all at Mass, especially the little Yankees who didn't know what a priest was, God help us.\nAt the house my mother reaches for the gate latch. Dad says, No, no, not that way. Not the front gate. They use the front door only for visits from the priest or funerals.\nWe make our way around the house to the kitchen door. Dad pushes in the door and there's Grandpa McCourt drinking tea from a big mug and Grandma McCourt frying something.\nOch, says Grandpa, you're here.\nOch, we are, says Dad. He points to my mother. This is Angela, he says. Grandpa says, Och, you must be worn out, Angela. Grandma says nothing, she turns back to the frying pan. Grandpa leads us through the kitchen to a large room with a long table and chairs. He says, Sit down and have some tea. Would you like boxty?\nMalachy says, What's boxty?\nDad laughs. Pancakes, son. Pancakes made with potatoes.\nGrandpa says, We have eggs. It's Easter Sunday and you can have all\nthe eggs you can hold.\nWe have tea and boxty and boiled eggs and we all fall asleep. I\nwake up in a bed with Malachy and the twins. My parents are in another bed over by the window. Where am I? It's getting dark. This is not the ship. Mam snores hink, Dad snores honk. I get up and poke at Dad. I have to pee. He says, Use the chamber pot.\nWhat?\nUnder the bed, son. The chamber pot. It has roses on it and maidens cavorting in the glen. Pee in that, son.\nI want to ask him what he's talking about for even if I'm bursting I feel strange peeing into a pot with roses and maidens cavorting, whatever they are. We had nothing like this in Classon Avenue where Mrs. Leibowitz sang in the lavatory while we clutched ourselves in the hall.\nNow Malachy has to use the chamber pot but he wants to sit on it. Dad says, No, you can't do that, son. You have to go outside. When he says that I have to go, too, to sit. He leads us downstairs and through the big room where Grandpa is sitting reading by the fire and Grandma is dozing in her chair. It's dark outside, though the moon is bright enough for us to see where we're going. Dad opens the door of a little house that has a seat with a hole in it. He shows Malachy and me how to sit on the hole and how to wipe ourselves with squares of newspaper stuck on a nail. Then he tells us wait while he goes inside, closes the door and grunts. The moon is so bright I can look down the field and see the things called cows and sheep and I wonder why they don't go home.\nIn the house there are other people in the room with my grandparents. Dad says, These are your aunts: Emily, Nora, Maggie, Vera. Your aunt Eva is in Ballymena with children like you. My aunts are not like Mrs. Leibowitz and Minnie MacAdorey, they nod their heads but they don't hug us or smile. Mam comes into the room with the twins and when\nDad tells his sisters, This is Angela and these are the twins, they just nod again.\nGrandma goes to the kitchen and soon we have bread and sausages and tea. The only one who speaks at the table is Malachy. He points his spoon at the aunts and asks their names again. When Mam tells him eat his sausage and be quiet his eyes fill with tears and Aunt Nora reaches over to comfort him. She says, There, there, and I wonder why everyone says there there when Malachy cries. I wonder what there there means.\nIt's quiet at the table till Dad says, Things are terrible in America. Grandma says, Och, aye. I read it in the paper. But they say Mr. Roosevelt is a good man and if you stayed you might have work by now.\nDad shakes his head and Grandma says, I don't know what you're going to do, Malachy. Things are worse here than they are in America. No work here and, God knows, we don't have room in this house for six more people.\nDad says, I thought I might get work on some of the farms. We could get a small place.\nWhere would you stay in the meantime? says Grandma. And how would you support yourself and your family?\nOch, I could go on the dole, I suppose.\nYou can't get off a ship from America and go on the dole, says Grandpa. They make you wait a while and what would you do while you're waiting?\nDad says nothing and Mam looks straight ahead at the wall.\nYou'd be better off in the Free State, says Grandma. Dublin is big and surely there's work there or in the farms around.\nYou're entitled to money from the IRA, too, says Grandpa. You did your bit and they've been handing out money to men all over the Free State. You could go to Dublin and ask for help. We can loan you the bus fare to Dublin. The twins can sit on your lap and you won't have to pay for them.\nDad says, Och, aye, and Mam stares at the wall with tears in her eyes.\nAfter we ate we went back to bed and next morning, all the grown- ups sat around looking sad. Soon a man came in a motor car and took us back down the road to the shop which had our trunk. They lifted the trunk up on the roof of a bus and we got into the bus. Dad said we were going to Dublin. Malachy said, What's Dublin? but no one answered him. Dad held Eugene on his lap and Mam held Oliver. Dad looked out at the fields and told me this is where Cuchulain liked to go for a walk. I asked him where Cuchulain hit the ball into the dog's mouth and he said a few miles away.\nMalachy said, Look, look, and we looked. It was a great silvery sheet of water and Dad said it was Lough Neagh, the largest lake in Ireland, the lake where Cuchulain used to swim after his great battles. Cuchulain would get so hot that when he jumped into Lough Neagh it boiled over and warmed the surrounding countryside for days. Some day we'd all come back and go swimming like Cuchulain himself. We'd fish for eels and fry them in a pan not like Cuchulain, who would pluck them from the lough and swallow them, wriggling, because there's great power in an eel.\nIs that right, Dad?\n'Tis.\nMam didn't look out the window at Lough Neagh. Her cheek rested on\ntop of Oliver's head and she stared at the floor of the bus.\nSoon the bus is rolling into a place where there are big houses, motor cars, horses pulling carts, people on bicycles and hundreds walking. Malachy is excited. Dad, Dad, where's the playground, the swings? I want to see Freddie Leibowitz.\nOch, son, you're in Dublin now, far from Classon Avenue. You're in Ireland, a long way from New York.\nWhen the bus stops the trunk is lifted down and set on the floor of the bus station. Dad tells Mam she can sit on a bench in the station while he goes to see the IRA man in a place called Terenure. He says there are lavatories in the station for the boys, he won't be long, he'll have money when he returns and we'll all have food. He tells me go with him and Mam says, No, I need him to help. But when Dad says, I'll need help carrying all that money, she laughs and says, All right, go with your Pop.\nYour Pop. That means she's in a good mood. If she says your father it means she's in a bad mood.\nDad holds my hand as I trot along beside him. He's a fast walker, it's a long way to Terenure and I'm hoping he'll stop and carry me the way he did with the twins in Toome. But he lopes along and says nothing except to ask people where Terenure is. In awhile he says we're in Terenure and now we have to find Mr. Charles Heggarty of the IRA. A man with a pink patch on his eye tells us we're on the right street, Charlie Heggarty lives at number fourteen, God blast him. The man tells Dad, I can see you're a man that did his bit. Dad says, Och, I did my bit, and the man says, I did me bit, too, and what did it get me but one eye less and a pension that wouldn't feed a canary.\nBut Ireland is free, says Dad, and that's a grand thing.\nFree, my arse, the man says. I think we were better off under the English. Good luck to you anyway, mister, for I think I know what you're here for.\nA woman opens the door at number fourteen. I'm afraid, she says, that Mr. Heggarty is busy. Dad tells her he just walked all the way from the middle of Dublin with his small son, that he left wife and three children waiting for him at the bus place, and if Mr. Heggarty is that busy then we'll wait for him on the doorstep.\nThe woman is back in a minute to say Mr. Heggarty has a little time to spare and would you come this way. Mr. Heggarty is sitting at a desk near a glowing fire. He says, What can I do for you? Dad stands before the desk and says, I have just returned from America with wife and four children. We have nothing. I fought with a Flying Column during the Troubles and I'm hoping you can help me now in the time of need.\nMr. Heggarty takes Dad's name and turns the pages of a big book on his desk. He shakes his head, No, no record of your service here. Dad makes a long speech. He tells Mr. Heggarty how he fought, where, when, how he had to be smuggled out of Ireland because of the price on his head, how he was raising his sons to love Ireland.\nMr. Heggarty says he's sorry but he can't be handing out money to every man who wanders in claiming he did his bit. Dad says to me, Remember this, Francis. This is the new Ireland. Little men in little chairs with little bits of paper. This is the Ireland men died for. Mr. Heggarty says he'll look into Dad's claim and he'll be sure to let him know what turns up. He'll let us have money to take the bus back into the city. Dad looks at the coins in Mr. Heggarty's hand and says, You could add to that and make the price of a pint.\nOh, it's the drink you want, is it?\nOne pint is hardly drink.\nYou'd walk the miles back and make the boy walk because you want a\npint, wouldn't you?\nWalking never killed anyone.\nI want you to leave this house, says Mr. Heggarty, or I'll call a\nguard, and you can be sure you'll never hear from me again. We're not handing out money to support the Guinness family.\nNight falls along the streets of Dublin. Children laugh and play under streetlights, mothers call from doorways, smells of cooking come at us all the way, through windows we see people around tables, eating. I'm tired and hungry and I want Dad to carry me but I know there's no use asking him now the way his face is tight and set. I let him hold my hand and I run to keep up with him till we reach the bus place where Mam is waiting with my brothers.\nThey're all asleep on the bench, my mother and three brothers. When Dad tells Mam there's no money she shakes her head and sobs, Oh, Jesus, what are we going to do? A man in a blue uniform comes over and asks her, What's up, missus? Dad tells him we're stranded there at the bus station, we have no money and no place to stay and the children are hungry. The man says he's going off duty now, he'll take us to the police barracks where he has to report anyway, and they'll see what can be done.\nThe man in uniform tells us we can call him guard. That's what you call policemen in Ireland. He asks us what you call policemen in America and Malachy says, cop. The guard pats him on the head and tells him he's a clever little Yankee.\nAt the police barracks the sergeant tells us we can spend the night. He's sorry but all he can offer is the floor. It's Thursday and the cells are filled with men who drank their dole money and wouldn't leave the pubs.\nThe guards give us hot sweet tea and thick slices of bread slathered with butter and jam and we're so happy we run around the barracks, playing. The guards say we're a great bunch of little Yanks and they'd like to take us home but I say, No, Malachy says, No, the twins say, No, No, and all the guards laugh. Men in cells reach out and pat our heads, they smell like Dad when he comes home singing about Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley going to die. The men say, Jasus, will ye listen to them. They sound like bloody fillum stars. Did yez fall outa the sky or what? Women in cells at the other end tell Malachy he's gorgeous and the twins are dotes. One woman talks to me. C'mere, love, would you like a sweet? I nod, and she says, All right, put your hand out. She takes something sticky from her mouth and puts it on my hand. There you are now, she says, a nice bit of butterscotch. Put that in your mouth. I don't want to put it in my mouth because it's sticky and wet from her mouth but I don't know what you're supposed to do when a woman in a cell offers you sticky butterscotch and I'm about to put it in my mouth when a guard comes, takes the butterscotch and throws it back at the woman. You drunken hoor, he says, leave the child alone, and all the women laugh.\nThe sergeant gives my mother a blanket and she sleeps stretched out on a bench. The rest of us lie on the floor. Dad sits with his back to the wall, his eyes open under the peak of his cap, and he smokes when the guards give him cigarettes. The guard who threw the butterscotch at the woman says he's from Ballymena in the north and he talks with Dad about people they know there and in other places like Cushendall and Toome. The\nguard says he'll have a pension some day and he'll live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away. Eels, he says, eels galore. Jasus, I love a fried eel. I ask Dad, Is this Cuchulain? and the guard laughs till his face turns red. Ah, Mother o' God, did yez hear this? The lad wants to know if I'm Cuchulain. A little Yank and he knows all about Cuchulain.\nDad says, No, he's not Cuchulain but he's a fine man who will live on the shores of Lough Neagh and fish his days away.\n****\nDad is shaking me. Up, Francis, up. It is noisy in the barracks. A boy mopping the floor is singing, Anyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this, Could it be true, someone like you Could love me, love me?\nI tell him that's my mother's song and he's to stop singing it but he just puffs on his cigarette and walks away and I wonder why people have to sing other people's songs. Men and women coming out of the cells are yawning and grunting. The woman who offered me the butterscotch stops and says, I had a drop taken, child. I'm sorry I made a fool of you, but the guard from Ballymena tells her, Move on, you oul' hoor, before I lock you up again.\nOh, lock me up, she says. In, out. What does it matter, you blue arsed bastard.\nMam is sitting up on the bench, the blanket wrapped around her. A woman with gray hair brings her a mug of tea and tells her, Sure, I'm the sergeant's wife and he said you might need help. Would you like a nice soft-boiled egg, missus?\nMam shakes her head, no.\nAh, now, missus, surely you should have a nice egg in your condition.\nBut Mam shakes her head and I wonder how she can say no to a soft- boiled egg when there's nothing in the world like it.\nAll right, ma'am, says the sergeant's wife, a bit of toast, then, and something for the children and your poor husband.\nShe goes back to another room and soon there's tea and bread. Dad drinks his tea but gives us his bread and Mam says, Will you eat your bread, for God's sake. You won't be much use to us falling down with the hunger. He shakes his head and asks the sergeant's wife is there any chance of a cigarette. She brings him the cigarette and tells Mam the guards in the barracks have taken up a collection to pay our train fares to Limerick. There will be a motor car to pick up our trunk and leave us at Kingsbridge Railway Station and, You'll be in Limerick in three or four hours.\nMam puts up her arms and hugs the sergeant's wife. God bless you and your husband and all the guards, Mam says. I don't know what we'd do without you. God knows 'tis a lovely thing to be back among our own.\n'Tis the least we could do, says the sergeant's wife. These are lovely children you have and I'm from Cork meself and I know what 'tis to be in Dublin without two pennies to rub together.\nDad sits at the other end of the bench, smoking his cigarette, drinking his tea. He stays that way till the motor car comes to take us through the streets of Dublin. Dad asks the driver if he'd mind going by way of the G. P. O. and the driver says, Is it a stamp you want or what? No, says Dad. I hear they put up a new statue of Cuchulain to honor the men who died in 1916 and I'd like to show it to my son here who has a great admiration for Cuchulain.\nThe driver says he has no notion of who this Cuchulain was but he wouldn't mind stopping one bit. He might come in himself and see what the commotion is all about for he hasn't been in the G. P. O. since he was a boy and the English nearly wrecked it with their big guns firing up from the Liffey River. He says you'll see the bullet holes all over the front and they should be left there to remind the Irish of English perfidy. I ask the man what's perfidy and he says ask your father and I would but we're stopping outside a big building with columns and that's the G. P. O.\nMam stays in the motor car while we follow the driver into the G. P. O. There he is, he says, there's your man Cuchulain.\nAnd I feel tears coming because I'm looking at him at last, Cuchulain, there on his pedestal in the G. P. O. He's golden and he has long hair, his head is hanging and there's a big bird perched on his shoulder.\nThe driver says, Now what in God's name is this all about? What's this fellow doin' with the long hair and the bird on his shoulder? And will you kindly tell me, mister, what this has to do with the men of 1916?\nDad says, Cuchulain fought to the end like the men of Easter Week. His enemies were afraid to go near him till they were sure he was dead and when the bird landed on him and drank his blood they knew.\nWell, says the driver, 'tis a sad day for the men of Ireland when they need a bird to tell them a man is dead. I think we better go now or we'll be missing that train to Limerick.\nThe sergeant's wife said she'd send a telegram to Grandma to meet us in Limerick and there she was on the platform, Grandma, with white hair, sour eyes, a black shawl, and no smile for my mother or any of us, even my brother, Malachy, who had the big smile and the sweet white teeth. Mam pointed to Dad. This is Malachy, she said, and Grandma nodded and looked away. She called two boys who were hanging around the railway station and paid them to carry the trunk. The boys had shaved heads, snotty noses, and no shoes and we followed them through the streets of Limerick. I asked Mam why they had no hair and she said their heads were shaved so that the lice would have no place to hide. Malachy said, What's a lice? and Mam said, Not lice. One of them is a louse. Grandma said, Will ye stop it! What kind o' talk is this? The boys whistled and laughed and trotted along as if they had shoes and Grandma told them, Stop that laughin' or 'tis droppin' an' breakin' that trunk ye'll be. They stopped the whistling and laughing and we followed them into a park with a tall pillar and a statue in the middle and grass so green it dazzled you.\nDad carried the twins, Mam carried a bag in one hand and held Malachy's hand with the other. When she stopped every few minutes to catch her breath, Grandma said, Are you still smokin' them fags? Them fags will be the death of you. There's enough consumption in Limerick without people smokin' fags on top of it an'\n'tis a rich man's foolishness.\nAlong the path through the park there were hundreds of flowers of different colors that excited the twins. They pointed and made squeaky noises and we laughed, everyone except Grandma, who pulled her shawl over her head. Dad stopped and put the twins down so that they could be closer to the flowers. He said, Flowers, and they ran back and forth, pointing, trying to say Flowers. One of the boys with the trunk said, God, are they Americans? and Mam said, They are. They were born in New York. All the\nboys were born in New York. The boy said to the other boy, God, they're Americans. They put the trunk down and stared at us and we stared back at them till Grandma said, Are ye goin' to stand here all day lookin' at flowers an' gawkin' at each other? And we all moved on again, out of the park, down a narrow lane and into another lane to Grandma's house.\nThere is a row of small houses on each side of the lane and Grandma lives in one of the small houses. Her kitchen has a shiny polished black iron range with a fire glowing in the grate. There is a table along the wall under the window and a press opposite with cups and saucers and vases. This press is always locked and she keeps the key in her purse because you're not supposed to use anything in there unless someone dies or returns from foreign parts or there's a visit by a priest.\nThere is a picture on the wall by the range of a man with long brown hair and sad eyes. He is pointing to his chest where there is a big heart with flames coming out of it. Mam tells us, That's the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and I want to know why the man's heart is on fire and why doesn't He throw water on it? Grandma says, Don't these children know anything about their religion? and Mam tells her it's different in America. Grandma says the Sacred Heart is everywhere and there's no excuse for that kind of ignorance.\nUnder the picture of the man with the burning heart there is a shelf with a red glass holding a flickering candle and next to it a small statue. Mam tells us, That's the Baby Jesus, the Infant of Prague, and if ye ever need anything pray to Him.\nMalachy says, Mam, could I tell Him I'm hungry, and Mam puts her finger to her lips.\nGrandma grumbles around the kitchen making tea and telling Mam to cut the loaf of bread and don't make the cuts too thick. Mam sits by the table with her breath coming hard and says she'll cut the bread in a minute. Dad takes the knife and starts slicing the bread and you can see Grandma doesn't like that. She frowns at him but says nothing even though he makes thick slices.\nThere aren't enough chairs for everyone so I sit on the stairs with my brothers to have bread and tea. Dad and Mam sit at the table and Grandma sits under the Sacred Heart with her mug of tea. She says, I don't know under God what I'm goin' to do with ye. There is no room in this house. There isn't room for even one of ye.\nMalachy says, Ye, ye, and starts to giggle and I say, Ye, ye, and the twins say, Ye, ye, and we're laughing so hard we can hardly eat our bread.\nGrandma glares at us. What are ye laughin' at? There's nothin' to laugh at in this house. Ye better behave yeerselves before I go over to\nye.\nShe won't stop saying Ye, and now Malachy is helpless with\nlaughter, spewing out his bread and tea, his face turning red.\nDad says, Malachy and the rest of you, stop it. But Malachy can't, he goes on laughing till Dad says, Come over here. He rolls up Malachy's\nsleeve and raises his hand to slap his arm.\nAre you going to behave yourself?\nMalachy's eyes fill with tears and he nods, I will, because Dad\nnever raised his hand like that before. Dad says, Be a good boy and go sit with your brothers, and he pulls down the sleeve and pats Malachy on the head.\nThat night Mam's sister, Aunt Aggie, came home from her job in the clothing factory. She was big like the MacNamara sisters, and she had flaming red hair. She wheeled a large bicycle into the little room behind the kitchen and came out to her supper. She was living in Grandma's because she had a fight with her husband, Pa Keating, who told her, when he had drink taken, You're a great fat cow, go home to your mother. That's what Grandma told Mam and that's why there was no room for us in Grandma's house. She had herself, Aunt Aggie, and her son Pat, who was my uncle and who was out selling newspapers.\nAunt Aggie complained when Grandma told her Mam would have to sleep with her that night. Grandma said, Oh, will you shut your gob. 'Tis only for one night an' that won't kill you an' if you don't like it you can go back to your husband where you belong anyway instead of runnin' home to me. Jesus, Mary an' Holy St. Joseph, look at this house- you an' Pat an' Angela and her clatther of Americans. Will I have any peace in the latter end of my life?\nShe spread coats and rags on the floor of the little back room and we slept there with the bicycle. Dad stayed on a chair in the kitchen, took us to the lavatory in the backyard when we needed it, and in the night hushed the twins when they cried from the cold.\nIn the morning, Aunt Aggie came for her bicycle telling us, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of my way?\nWhen she left, Malachy kept saying, Will ye mind yeerselves, will ye? Will ye get out of the way, will ye? and I could hear Dad laughing out in the kitchen till Grandma came down the stairs and he had to tell Malachy be quiet.\nThat day Grandma and Mam went out and found a furnished room on Windmill Street where Aunt Aggie had a flat with her husband, Pa Keating. Grandma paid the rent, ten shillings for two weeks. She gave Mam money for food, loaned us a kettle, a pot, a frying pan, knives and spoons, jam jars to be used for mugs, a blanket and a pillow. She said that was all she could afford anymore, that Dad would have to get up off his arse, get a job, go on the dole, go for the charity at the St. Vincent de Paul Society or go on the relief.\nThe room had a fireplace where we could boil water for our tea or an egg in case we ever came into money. We had a table and three chairs and a bed, which Mam said was the biggest she had ever seen. We were glad of the bed that night, worn out after nights on floors in Dublin and in Grandma's. It didn't matter that there were six of us in the bed, we were together, away from grandmothers and guards, Malachy could say ye ye ye and we could laugh as much as we liked.\nDad and Mam lay at the head of the bed, Malachy and I at the bottom, the twins wherever they could find comfort. Malachy made us laugh again. Ye, ye, ye, he said, and oy oy oy, and then fell asleep. Mam made the little hink hink snore sound that told us she was sleeping. In the moonlight I could look up the length of the bed and see Dad still awake and when Oliver cried in his sleep Dad reached for him and held him. Whisht, he said. Whisht.\nThen Eugene sat up, screaming, tearing at himself. Ah, ah, Mommy, Mommy. Dad sat up. What? What's up, son? Eugene went on crying and when Dad leaped from the bed and turned on the gaslight we saw the fleas, leaping, jumping, fastened to our flesh. We slapped at them and slapped but they hopped from body to body, hopping, biting. We tore at the bites till they bled. We jumped from the bed, the twins crying, Mam moaning,\nOh, Jesus, will we have no rest! Dad poured water and salt into a jam jar and dabbed at our bites. The salt burned but he said we'd feel better\nsoon.\nMam sat by the fireplace with the twins on her lap. Dad pulled on\nhis trousers and dragged the mattress off the bed and out to the street. He filled the kettle and the pot with water, stood the mattress against the wall, pounded it with a shoe, told me to keep pouring water on the ground to drown the fleas dropping there. The Limerick moon was so bright I could see bits of it shimmering in the water and I wanted to scoop up moon bits but how could I with the fleas leaping on my legs. Dad kept pounding with the shoe and I had to run back through the house to the backyard tap for more water in the kettle and the pot. Mam said, Look at you. Your shoes are drenched and you'll catch your death and your father will surely get the pneumonia without a shoe to his foot.\nA man on a bicycle stopped and wanted to know why Dad was beating that mattress. Mother o' God, he said, I never heard such a cure for fleas. Do you know that if a man could jump like a flea one lep would take him halfway to the moon? The thing to do is this, when you go back inside with that mattress stick it on the bed upside down and that will confuse the little buggers. They won't know where they are and they'll be biting the mattress or each other, which is the best cure of all. After they bite the human being they have the frenzy, you know, for there are other fleas around them that also bit the human being and the smell of the blood is too much for them and they go out of their minds. They're a right bloody torment an' I should know for didn't I grow up in Limerick, down in the Irishtown, an' the fleas there were so plentiful an' forward they'd sit on the toe of your boot an' discuss Ireland's woeful history with you. It is said there were no fleas in ancient Ireland, that they were brought in be the English to drive us out of our wits entirely, an'I wouldn't put it past the English. An'isn't it a very curious thing that St. Patrick drove the snakes out of Ireland an' the English brought in the fleas. For centuries Ireland was a lovely peaceful place, snakes gone, not a flea to be found. You could stroll the four green fields of Ireland without fear of snakes an' have a good night's sleep with no fleas to bother you. Them snakes were doin' no harm, they wouldn't bother you unless you cornered them an' they lived off other creatures that move under bushes an'such places, whereas the flea sucks the blood from you mornin' noon an' night for that's his nature an' he can't help himself. I hear for a fact that places that have snakes galore have no fleas. Arizona, for instance. You're forever hearing about the snakes of Arizona but when did you ever hear of fleas in Arizona? Good luck to you. I have to be careful standin' here for if one of them gets on my clothes I might as well invite his whole family home. They multiply faster than Hindus.\nDad said, You wouldn't by any chance have a cigarette, would you?\nA cigarette? Oh, sure, of course. Here you are. Aren't I nearly destroyed from the fags myself. The oul' hacking cough, you know. So powerful it nearly knocks me off the bicycle. I can feel that cough stirring in me solar plexus an' workin' its way up through me entrails till the next thing it takes off the top o' me head.\nHe struck a match on a box, lit a cigarette for himself and held out the match for Dad. Of course, he said, you're bound to have the cough when you live in Limerick because this is the capital city of the weak chest and the weak chest leads to the consumption. If all the people that has consumption in Limerick were to die this would be a ghost town,\nthough I don't have consumption meself. No, this cough was a present from the Germans. He paused, puffed on his cigarette, and struggled with a cough. Bejesus, excuse the language, but the fags'll get me in the end. Well, I'll leave you now to the mattress an' remember what I told you, confuse the little buggers.\nHe wobbled away on his bicycle, the cigarette dangling from his mouth, the cough racking his body. Dad said, Limerickmen talk too much. Come on, we'll put this mattress back and see if there's any sleep in this night.\nMam sat by the fireplace with the twins asleep on her lap, and Malachy lay curled up on the floor by her feet. She said, Who was that you were talking to? It sounded very like Pa Keating, Aggie's husband. I could tell by the cough. He got that cough in France in the war when he swallowed the gas.\nWe slept the rest of that night, and in the morning we saw where the fleas had feasted, our flesh pink with flea welts and bright with the blood of our scratches.\nMam made tea and fried bread, and once more Dad dabbed at our bites with the salty water. He hauled the mattress outside again to the backyard. On a cold day like this the fleas would surely freeze to death and we'd all have a good night's sleep.\nA few days later when we're settled into the room Dad is shaking me out of my dreams. Up, Francis, up. Put on your clothes and run over for your aunt Aggie. Your mother needs her. Hurry.\nMam is moaning in the bed, her face pure white. Dad has Malachy and the twins out of the bed and sitting on the floor by the dead fire. I run across the street and knock on Aunt Aggie's door till Uncle Pat Keating comes coughing and grumbling, What's up? What's up?\nMy mother is moaning in the bed. I think she's sick.\nNow Aunt Aggie comes grumbling. Ye are nothing but trouble since ye came from America.\nLeave him alone, Aggie, he's only a child that's doing what he's told.\nShe tells Uncle Pa go back to bed, that he has to go to work in the morning not like some from the North that she won't mention. He says, No, no, I'm coming. There's something wrong with Angela.\nDad tells me sit over there with my brothers. I don't know what's up with Mam because everyone is whispering and I can barely hear Aunt\nAggie\nPa is\nabout\nnever looks at him.\ntelling Uncle Pa the child is lost run for the ambulance and Uncle out the door, Aunt Aggie telling Mam you can say what you like Limerick but the ambulance is fast. She doesn't talk to my father,\nMalachy says, Dad, is Mammy sick?\nOch, she'll be all right, son. She has to see the doctor.\nI wonder what child is lost because we're all here, one two three\nfour of us, not a lost child anywhere and why can't they tell me what's wrong with my mother. Uncle Pa comes back and the ambulance is right behind him. A man comes in with a stretcher and after they carry Mam away there are blood spots on the floor by the bed. Malachy bit his tongue and there was blood and the dog on the street had blood and he died. I want to ask Dad to tell me if Mam will be gone forever like my sister Margaret but he's going with Mam and there's no use asking Aunt Aggie anything for fear she'd bite your head off. She wipes away the blood spots and tells us get back into bed and stay there till Dad comes home.\nIt's the middle of the night and the four of us are warm in the bed and we fall asleep till Dad comes home and tells us Mam is nice and comfortable in the hospital and she'll be home in no time.\nLater, Dad goes to the Labour Exchange for the dole. There is no hope of a laboring man with a North of Ireland accent getting a job in Limerick.\nWhen he returns, he tells Mam we'll be getting nineteen shillings a week. She says that's just enough for all of us to starve on. Nineteen shillings for six of us? That's less than four dollars in American money and how are we supposed to live on that? What are we to do when we have to pay rent in a fortnight? If the rent for this room is five shillings a week we'll have fourteen shillings for food and clothes and coal to boil the water for the tea.\nDad shakes his head, sips his tea from a jam jar, stares out the window and whistles \"The Boys of Wexford. \" Malachy and Oliver clap their hands and dance around the room and Dad doesn't know whether to whistle or smile because you can't do both and he can't help himself. He has to stop and smile and pat Oliver's head and then go back to the whistling. Mam smiles, too, but it's a very quick smile and when she looks into the ashes you can see the worry where the corners of her mouth turn down.\nNext day she tells Dad to mind the twins and takes Malachy and me with her to the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We stand in a queue with women wearing black shawls. They ask our names and smile when we talk. They say, Lord above, would you listen to the little Yankees, and they wonder why Mam in her American coat would be looking for charity since there's hardly enough for the poor people of Limerick without Yanks coming over and taking the bread out of their mouths.\nMam tells them a cousin gave her that coat in Brooklyn, that her husband has no work, that she has other children at home, twin boys. The women sniff and pull their shawls about them, they have their own troubles. Mam tells them she had to leave America because she couldn't stand it after her baby girl died. The women sniff again but now it's because Mam is crying. Some say they lost little ones, too, and there's nothing worse in the world, you could live as long as Methuselem's wife but you never get over it. No man can ever know what it is to be a mother that has lost a child, not if the man lived longer than two Methuselems.\nThey all have a good cry till a red-haired woman passes a little box around. The women pick something from the box between their fingers and stuff it up their noses. A young woman sneezes and the red-haired woman laughs. Ah, sure, Biddy, you're not able for that snuff. Come here, little Yankee boys, have a pinch. She plants the brown stuff in our nostrils and we sneeze so hard the women stop crying and laugh till they have to wipe their eyes with their shawls. Mam tells us, That's good for ye, 'twill clear yeer heads.\nThe young woman, Biddy, tells Mam we're two lovely boys. She points at Malachy. That little fella with the goldy ringlet, isn't he gorgeous? He could be a film star with Shirley Temple. And Malachy smiles and warms up the queue.\nThe woman with the snuff says to Mam, Missus, I don't want to be forward but I think you should be sitting down for we heard about your\nloss.\nAnother woman worries, Ah, no, they don't like that. Who don't like what?\nAh, sure, Nora Molloy, the Society don't like us sittin' on the steps. They want us to be standin' respectful against the wall.\nThey can kiss my arse, says Nora, the red-haired woman. Sit down there, missus, on that step an' I'll sit next to you an' if there's one word out of the St. Vincent de Paul Society I'll take the face off 'em, so I will. Do you smoke, missus?\nI do, says Mam, but I don't have them.\nNora takes a cigarette from a pocket in her apron, breaks it, and offers half to Mam.\nThe worried woman says, They don't like that either. They say every fag you smoke is taking food from the mouth of your child. Mr. Quinlivan inside is dead against it. He says if you have money for the fags you have money for food.\nQuinlivan can kiss my arse, too, the grinny oul' bastard. Is he going to begrudge us a puff of a fag, the only comfort we have in the world?\nA door opens at the end of the hall and a man appears. Are any of ye waiting for children's boots?\nWomen raise their hands, I am. I am.\nWell, the boots are all gone. Ye'll have to come back next month. But my Mikey needs boots for school.\nThey're all gone, I told you.\nBut 'tis freezin' abroad, Mr. Quinlivan.\nThe boots are all gone. Nothing I can do. What's this? Who's\nsmoking?\nNora waves her cigarette. I am, she says, and enjoying it down to\nthe last ash.\nEvery puff you take, he starts.\nI know, she says, I'm taking food out of the mouths of my children. You're insolent, woman. You'll get no charity here.\nIs that a fact? Well, Mr. Quinlivan, if I don't get it here I know\nwhere I will.\nWhat are you talking about?\nI'll go to the Quakers. They'll give me the charity.\nMr. Quinlivan steps toward Nora and points a finger. Do you know\nwhat we have here? We have a souper in our midst. We had the soupers in the Famine. The Protestants went round telling good Catholics that if they gave up their faith and turned Protestant they'd get more soup than their bellies could hold and, God help us, some Catholics took the soup, and were ever after known as soupers and lost their immortal souls doomed to the deepest part of hell. And you, woman, if you go to the Quakers you'll lose your immortal soul and the souls of your children.\nother\nThen, Mr. Quinlivan, you'll have to save us, won't you?\nHe stares at her and she stares back at him. His eyes wander to the\nwomen. One puts her hand to her mouth to smother a laugh.\nWhat are you tittering about? he barks.\nOh, nothing, Mr. Quinlivan. Honest to God.\nI'm telling ye once more, no boots. And he slams the door behind\nhim.\nOne by one the women are called into the room. When Nora comes out\nshe's smiling and waving a piece of paper. Boots, she says. Three pairs I'm gettin' for my children. Threaten the men in there with the Quakers and they'll give you the drawers off their arses.\nWhen Mam is called she brings Malachy and me in with her. We stand before a table where three men are sitting asking questions. Mr. Quinlivan starts to say something but the man in the middle says, Enough out of you, Quinlivan. If we left it up to you we'd have the poor people of Limerick jumping into the arms of the Protestants.\nHe turns to Mam, he wants to know where she got that fine red coat. She tells him what she told the women outside and when she comes to the death of Margaret she shakes and sobs. She tells the men she's very sorry for crying like that but it was only a few months ago and she's not over it yet, not even knowing where her baby was buried if she was buried at all, not knowing even if she was baptized itself because she was so weak from having the four boys she didn't have the energy to be going to the church for the baptism and it's a heart scald to think Margaret might be in Limbo forever with no hope of her ever seeing the rest of us whether we're in heaven, hell, or Purgatory itself.\nMr. Quinlivan brings her his chair. Ah, now, missus. Ah, now. Sit down, will you. Ah, now.\nThe other men look at the table, the ceiling. The man in the middle says he's giving Mam a docket to get a week's groceries at McGrath's shop on Parnell Street. There will be tea, sugar, flour, milk, butter and a separate docket for a bag of coal from Sutton's coal yard on the Dock Road.\nThe third man says, Of course you won't be getting this every week, missus. We will be visiting your house to see if there's a real need. We have to do that, missus, so we can review your claim.\nMam wipes her face on the back of her sleeve and takes the docket. She tells the men, God bless you for your kindness. They nod and look at the table, the ceiling, the walls and tell her send in the next woman.\nThe women outside tell Mam, When you go to McGrath's, keep an eye on the oul' bitch for she'll cheat you on the weight. She'll put stuff on a paper on the scale with the paper hanging down on her side behind the counter where she thinks you can't see it. She'll pull on that paper so that you're lucky if you get half of what you're supposed to get. And she has pictures of the Virgin Mary and the Sacred Heart of Jesus all over the shop, and she's forever on her knees abroad in St. Joseph's chapel clackin' her rosary beads an' breathing like a virgin martyr, the oul' bitch.\nNora says, I'll go with you, missus. I'm on to the same Mrs. McGrath and I'll know if she's cheating you.\nShe leads the way to the shop in Parnell Street. The woman behind the counter is pleasant to Mam in her American coat till Mam shows the St. Vincent de Paul docket. The woman says, I don't know what you're doing here at this hour of the day. I never serve the charity cases before six in the evening. But this is your first time and I'll make an exception.\nShe says to Nora, Do you have a docket, too?\nNo. I'm a friend helping this poor family with their first docket from the St. Vincent de Paul.\nThe woman lays a sheet of newspaper on the scale and pours on flour from a large bag. When she finishes pouring, she says, There's a pound of flour.\nI don't think so, says Nora. That's a very small pound of flour. The woman flushes and glares, Are you accusin' me?\nAh, no, Mrs. McGrath, says Nora. I think there was a little accident there the way your hip was pressed against that paper and you didn't even know the paper was pulled down a bit. Oh, God, no. A woman like you that's forever on her knees before the Virgin Mary is an inspiration to us all and is that your money I see on the floor there?\nMrs. McGrath steps back quickly and the needle on the scale jumps and quivers. What money? she says, till she looks at Nora, and knows. Nora smiles. Must be a trick of the shadows, she says, and smiles at the scale. There was a mistake right enough for that shows barely half a pound of flour.\nThat scale gives me more trouble, says Mrs. McGrath.\nI'm sure it does, says Nora.\nBut my conscience is clear before God, says Mrs. McGrath.\nI'm sure it is, says Nora, and you're admired by one and all at the\nSt. Vincent de Paul Society and the Legion of Mary.\nI try to be a good Catholic.\nTry? God knows 'tis little trying you'd have for you're well known\nfor having a kind heart and I was wondering if you could spare a couple of sweets for the little boys here.\nWell, now, I'm not a millionaire, but here...\nGod bless you, Mrs. McGrath, and I know it's asking a lot but could you possibly lend me a couple of cigarettes?\nWell, now, they're not on the docket. I'm not here to supply luxuries.\nIf you could see your way, missus, I'd be sure to mention your kindness to the St. Vincent de Paul.\nAll right, all right, says Mrs. McGrath. Here. One time for the cigarettes and one time only.\nGod bless you, says Nora, and I'm sorry you had so much trouble with that scale.\nOn the way home we stopped in the People's Park and sat on a bench while Malachy and I sucked on our sweets and Mam and Nora smoked their cigarettes. The smoking brought on Nora's cough and she told Mam the fags would kill her in the end, that there was a touch of consumption in her family and no one lived to a ripe old age, though who would want to in Limerick, a place where you could look around and the first thing you noticed was a scarcity of gray hairs, all the gray hairs either in the graveyard or across the Atlantic working on railroads or sauntering around in police uniforms.\nYou're lucky, missus, that you saw a bit of the world. Oh, God, I'd give anything to see New York, people dancing up and down Broadway without a care. No, I had to go and fall for a boozer with the charm, Peter Molloy, a champion pint drinker that had me up the pole and up the aisle when I was barely seventeen. I was ignorant, missus. We grew up ignorant in Limerick, so we did, knowing feck all about anything and signs on, we're mothers before we're women. And there's nothing here but rain and oul' biddies saying the rosary. I'd give me teeth to get out, go to America or even England itself. The champion pint drinker is always on the dole and sometimes he even drinks that and drives me so demented I wind up in the lunatic asylum.\nShe drew on her cigarette and gagged, coughing till her body rocked back and forth, and in between the coughs she whimpered, Jesus, Jesus. When the cough died away she said she had to go home and take her medicine. She said, I'll see you next week, missus, at the St. Vincent de\nPaul. If you're stuck for anything send a message to me at Vize's Field. Ask anyone for the wife of Peter Molloy, champion pint drinker.\nEugene is sleeping under a coat on the bed. Dad sits by the fireplace with Oliver on his lap. I wonder why Dad is telling Oliver a Cuchulain story. He knows the Cuchulain stories are mine, but when I look at Oliver I don't mind. His cheeks are bright red, he's staring into the dead fire, and you can see he has no interest in Cuchulain. Mam puts her hand on his forehead. I think he has a fever, she says. I wish I had an onion and I'd boil it in milk and pepper. That's good for the fever. But even if I had what would I boil the milk on? We need coal for that fire.\nShe gives Dad the docket for the coal down the Dock Road. He takes me with him but it's dark and all the coal yards are closed.\nWhat are we going to do now, Dad?\nI don't know, son.\nAhead of us women in shawls and small children are picking up coal\nalong the road.\nThere, Dad, there's coal.\nOch, no, son. We won't pick coal off the road. We're not beggars. He tells Mam the coal yards are closed and we'll have to drink milk\nand eat bread tonight, but when I tell her about the women on the road she passes Eugene to him.\nIf you're too grand to pick coal off the road I'll put on my coat and go down the Dock Road.\nShe gets a bag and takes Malachy and me with her. Beyond the Dock Road there is something wide and dark with lights glinting in it. Mam says that's the River Shannon. She says that's what she missed most of all in America, the River Shannon. The Hudson was lovely but the Shannon sings. I can't hear the song but my mother does and that makes her happy. The other women are gone from the Dock Road and we search for the bits of coal that drop from lorries. Mam tells us gather anything that burns, coal, wood, cardboard, paper. She says, There are them that burn the horse droppings but we're not gone that low yet. When her bag is nearly full she says, Now we have to find an onion for Oliver. Malachy says he'll find one but she tells him, No, you don't find onions on the road, you get them in shops.\nThe minute he sees a shop he cries out, There's a shop, and runs\nin.\nOonyen, he says. Oonyen for Oliver.\nMam runs into the shop and tells the women behind the counter, I'm\nsorry. The woman says, Lord, he's a dote. Is he an American or what? Mam says he is. The woman smiles and shows two teeth, one on each\nside of her upper gum. A dote, she says, and look at them gorgeous goldy curls. And what is it he wants now? A sweet?\nAh, no, says Mam. An onion.\nThe woman laughs, An onion? I never heard a child wanting an onion before. Is that what they like in America?\nMam says, I just mentioned I wanted to get an onion for my other child that's sick. Boil the onion in milk, you know.\nTrue for you, missus. You can't beat the onion boiled in milk. And look, little boy, here's a sweet for yourself and one for the other little boy, the brother, I suppose.\nMam says, Ah, sure, you shouldn't. Say thank you, boys.\nThe woman says, Here's a nice onion for the sick child, missus.\nMam says, Oh, I can't buy the onion now, missus. I don't have a penny on me.\nI'm giving you the onion, missus. Let it never be said a child went sick in Limerick for want of an onion. And don't forget to sprinkle in a little pepper. Do you have pepper, missus?\nAh, no, I don't but I should be getting it any day now.\nWell, here, missus. Pepper and a little salt. Do the child all the good in the world.\nMam says, God bless you, ma'am, and her eyes are watery.\nDad is walking back and forth with Oliver in his arms and Eugene is playing on the floor with a pot and a spoon. Dad says, Did you get the onion?\nI did, says Mam, and more. I got coal and the way of lighting it. I knew you would. I said a prayer to St. Jude. He's my favorite saint, patron of desperate cases.\nI got the coal. I got the onion, no help from St. Jude.\nDad says, You shouldn't be picking up coal off the road like a common beggar. It isn't right. Bad example for the boys.\nThen you should have sent St. Jude down the Dock Road.\nMalachy says, I'm hungry, and I'm hungry, too, but Mam says, Ye'll wait till Oliver has his onion boiled in milk.\nShe gets the fire going, cuts the onion in half, drops it in the boiling milk with a little butter and sprinkles the milk with pepper. She takes Oliver on her lap and tries to feed him but he turns away and looks into the fire.\nAh, come on, love, she says. Good for you. Make you big and strong.\nHe tightens his mouth against the spoon. She puts the pot down, rocks him till he's asleep, lays him on the bed and tells the rest of us be quiet or she'll demolish us. She slices the other half of the onion and fries it in butter with slices of bread. She lets us sit on the floor around the fire where we eat the fried bread and sip at the scalding sweet tea in jam jars. She says, That fire is good and bright so we can turn off that gaslight till we get money for the meter.\nThe fire makes the room warm and with the flames dancing in the coal you can see faces and mountains and valleys and animals leaping. Eugene falls asleep on the floor and Dad lifts him to the bed beside Oliver. Mam puts the boiled onion pot up on the mantelpiece for fear a mouse or rat might be at it. She says she's tired out from the day, the Vincent de Paul Society, Mrs. McGrath's shop, the search for coal down the Dock Road, the worry over Oliver not wanting the boiled onion, and if he's like this tomorrow she's taking him to the doctor, and now she's going to bed.\nSoon we're all in bed and if there's the odd flea I don't mind because it's warm in the bed with the six of us and I love the glow of the fire the way it dances on the walls and ceiling and makes the room go red and black, red and black, till it dims to white and black and all you can hear is a little cry from Oliver turning in my mother's arms.\nIn the morning Dad is lighting the fire, making tea, cutting the bread. He's already dressed and he's telling Mam hurry up and get dressed. He says to me, Francis, your little brother Oliver is sick and we're taking him to the hospital. You are to be a good boy and take care of your two brothers. We'll be back soon.\nMam says, When we're out go easy with that sugar. We're not millionaires.\nWhen Mam picks up Oliver and wraps him in a coat Eugene stands on the bed. I want Ollie, he says. Ollie play.\nOllie will be back soon, she says, and you can play with him. Now you can play with Malachy and Frank.\nOllie, Ollie, I want Ollie.\nHe follows Oliver with his eyes and when they're gone he sits on the bed looking out the window. Malachy says, Genie, Genie, we have bread, we have tea. Sugar on your bread, Genie. He shakes his head and pushes away the bread Malachy is offering. He crawls to the place where Oliver slept with Mam, puts his head down and stares out the window.\nGrandma is at the door. I heard your father and mother were running down Henry Street with the child in their arms. Now where are they gone to?\nOliver is sick, I said. He wouldn't eat the boiled onion in milk. What are you blatherin' about?\nWouldn't eat the boiled onion and got sick.\nAnd who's minding ye?\nI am.\nAnd what's up with the child in the bed? What's That's Eugene. He misses Oliver. They're twins. I know they're twins. That child looks starved.\nhis name?\nHave ye any\nporridge here?\nWhat's porridge? says Malachy.\nJesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! What's porridge! Porridge is\nporridge. That's what porridge is. Ye are the most ignorant bunch o' Yanks I ever seen. Come on, put on yeer clothes and we'll go across the street to your aunt Aggie. She's there with the husband, Pa Keating, and she'll give ye some porridge.\nShe picks up Eugene, wraps him in her shawl and we cross the street to Aunt Aggie's. She's living with Uncle Pa again because he said she wasn't a fat cow after all.\nDo you have any porridge? Grandma says to Aunt Aggie.\nPorridge? Am I supposed to be feeding porridge to a crowd of Yanks? Pity about you, says Grandma. It won't kill you to give them a\nlittle porridge.\nAnd I suppose they'll be wanting sugar and milk on top of\neverything or they might be banging on my door looking for an egg if you don't mind. I don't know why we have to pay for Angela's mistakes.\nJesus, says Grandma, 'tis a good thing you didn't own that stable in Bethlehem or the Holy Family would still be wanderin' the world crumblin' with the hunger.\nGrandma pushes her way past Aunt Aggie, puts Eugene on a chair near the fire and makes the porridge. A man comes in from another room. He has black curly hair and his skin is black and I like his eyes because they're very blue and ready to smile. He's Aunt Aggie's husband, the man who stopped the night we were attacking the fleas and told us all about fleas and snakes, the man with the cough he got from swallowing gas in the war.\nMalachy says, Why are you all black? and Uncle Pa Keating laughs and coughs so hard he has to ease himself with a cigarette. Oh, the little Yanks, he says. They're not a bit shy. I'm black because I work at the Limerick Gas Works shoveling coal and coke into the furnaces. Gassed in France and back to Limerick to work in the gas works. When you grow up you'll laugh.\nMalachy and I have to leave the table so the big people can sit and have tea. They have their tea but Uncle Pa Keating, who is my uncle because he's married to my aunt Aggie, picks up Eugene and takes him on his lap. He says, This is a sad little fella, and makes funny faces and silly sounds. Malachy and I laugh but Eugene only reaches up to touch the blackness of Pa Keating's skin, and then when Pa pretends to bite his little hand, Eugene laughs and everyone in the room laughs. Malachy goes to Eugene and tries to make him laugh even more but Eugene turns away and hides his face in Pa Keating's shirt.\nI think he likes me, says Pa, and that's when Aunt Aggie puts down her teacup and starts to bawl, Waah, waah, waah, big teardrops tumbling down her fat red face.\nAw, Jesus, says Grandma, there she is again. What's up with you this time?\nAnd Aunt Aggie blubbers, To see Pa there with a child on his lap an' me with no hope of having my own.\nGrandma barks at her, Stop talkin' like that in front of the children. Have you no shame? When God is good and ready He'll send you your family.\nAunt Aggie sobs, Angela with five born an' one just gone an' her so useless she couldn't scrub a floor an' me with none an' I can scrub an' clean with the best and make any class of a stew or a fry.\nPa Keating laughs, I think I'll keep this little fella.\nMalachy runs to him. No, no, no. That's my brother, that's Eugene. And I say, No, no, no, that's our brother. Aunt Aggie pats the tears on her cheeks. She says, I don't want nothing of Angela's. I don't want nothing that's half Limerick and half North of Ireland, so I don't, so ye can take him home. I'll have me own someday if I have to do a hundred novenas to the Virgin Mary and her mother, St. Ann, or if I have to crawl from here to Lourdes on me two bended knees.\nGrandma says, That's enough. Ye have had yeer porridge and 'tis time to go home and see if yeer father and mother are back from the hospital.\nShe puts on her shawl and goes to pick up Eugene but he clutches so hard at Pa Keating's shirt she has to pull him away though he keeps looking back at Pa till we're out the door.\n***\nWe followed Grandma back to our room. She put Eugene in the bed and gave him a drink of water. She told him to be a good boy and go to sleep for his little brother, Oliver, would be home soon and they'd be playing again there on the floor.\nBut he kept looking out the window.\nShe told Malachy and me we could sit on the floor and play but to be quiet because she was going to say her prayers. Malachy went to the bed and sat by Eugene and I sat on a chair at the table making out words on the newspaper that was our tablecloth. All you could hear in the room was Malachy whispering to make Eugene happy and Grandma mumbling to the click of her rosary beads. It was so quiet I put my head on the table and fell asleep.\nDad is touching my shoulder. Come on, Francis, you have to take care of your little brothers.\nMam is slumped on the edge of the bed, making small crying sounds like a bird. Grandma is pulling on her shawl. She says, I'll go down to\nThompson the undertaker about the coffin and the carriage. The St. Vincent de Paul Society will surely pay for that, God knows.\nShe goes out the door. Dad stands facing the wall over the fire, beating on his thighs with his fists, sighing, Och, och, och.\nDad frightens me with his och, och, och, and Mam frightens me with her small bird sounds and I don't know what to do though I wonder if anyone will light the fire in the grate so that we can have tea and bread because it's a long time since we had the porridge. If Dad would move away from the fireplace I could light the fire myself. All you need is paper, a few bits of coal or turf, and a match. He won't move so I try to go around his legs while he's beating on his thighs but he notices me and wants to know why I'm trying to light the fire. I tell him we're all hungry and he lets out a crazy laugh. Hungry? he says. Och, Francis, your wee brother Oliver is dead. Your wee sister is dead and your wee brother is dead.\nHe picks me up and hugs me so hard I cry out. Then Malachy cries, my mother cries, Dad cries, I cry, but Eugene stays quiet. Then Dad sniffles, We'll have a feast. Come on, Francis.\nHe tells my mother we'll be back in awhile but she has Malachy and Eugene on her lap in the bed and she doesn't look up. He carries me through the streets of Limerick and we go from shop to shop with him asking for food or anything they can give to a family that has two children dead in a year, one in America, one in Limerick, and in danger of losing three more for the want of food and drink. Most shopkeepers shake their heads. Sorry for your troubles but you could go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society or get the public assistance.\nDad says he's glad to see the spirit of Christ alive in Limerick and they tell him they don't need the likes of him with his northern accent to be telling them about Christ and he should be ashamed of himself dragging a child around like that like a common beggar, a tinker, a knacker.\nA few shopkeepers give bread, potatoes, tins of beans and Dad says, We'll go home now and you boys can eat something, but we meet Uncle Pa Keating and he tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and would Dad like to have a pint in this pub here?\nThere are men sitting in this pub with great glasses of black stuff before them. Uncle Pa Keating and Dad have the black stuff, too. They lift their glasses carefully and slowly drink. There is creamy white stuff on their lips, which they lick with little sighs. Uncle Pa gets me a bottle of lemonade and Dad gives me a piece of bread and I don't feel hungry anymore. Still, I wonder how long we'll sit here with Malachy and Eugene hungry at home, hours from the porridge, which Eugene didn't eat anyway.\nDad and Uncle Pa drink their glass of black stuff and have another. Uncle Pa says, Frankie, this is the pint. This is the staff of life. This is the best thing for nursing mothers and for those who are long weaned.\nHe laughs and Dad smiles and I laugh because I think that's what you're supposed to do when Uncle Pa says something. He doesn't laugh when he tells the other men about Oliver dying. The other men tip their hats to Dad. Sorry for your troubles, mister, and surely you'll have a pint.\nDad says yes to the pints and soon he's singing Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry and song after song I never heard before and crying over his lovely little girl, Margaret, that died in America and his little boy, Oliver, dead beyond in the City Home Hospital. It frightens me the way he\nyells and cries and sings and I wish I could be at home with my three brothers, no, my two brothers, and my mother.\nThe man behind the bar says to Dad, I think now, mister, you've had enough. We're sorry for your troubles but you have to take that child home to his mother that must be heartbroken by the fire.\nDad says, One, one more pint, just one, eh? and the man says no. Dad shakes his fist. I did me bit for Ireland, and when the man comes out and takes Dad's arm, Dad tries to push him away.\nUncle Pa says, Come on now, Malachy, stop the blaguarding. You have to go home to Angela. You have a funeral tomorrow and the lovely children waiting for you.\nBut Dad struggles till a few men push him out into the darkness. Uncle Pa stumbles out with the bag of food. Come on, he says. We'll go back to your room.\nDad wants to go to another place for a pint but Uncle Pa says he has no more money. Dad says he'll tell everyone his sorrows and they'll give him pints. Uncle Pa says that's a disgraceful thing to do and Dad cries on his shoulder. You're a good friend, he tells Uncle Pa. He cries again till Uncle Pa pats him on the back. It's terrible, terrible, says Uncle Pa, but you'll get over this in time.\nDad straightens up and looks at him. Never, he says. Never.\nNext day we rode to the hospital in a carriage with a horse. They put Oliver in a white box that came with us in the carriage and we took him to the graveyard. They put the white box into a hole in the ground and covered it with earth. My mother and Aunt Aggie cried, Grandma looked angry, Dad, Uncle Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat Sheehan looked sad but did not cry and I thought that if you're a man you can cry only when you have the black stuff that is called the pint.\nI did not like the jackdaws that perched on trees and gravestones and I did not want to leave Oliver with them. I threw a rock at a jackdaw that waddled over toward Oliver's grave. Dad said I shouldn't throw rocks at jackdaws, they might be somebody's soul. I didn't know what a soul was but I didn't ask him because I didn't care. Oliver was dead and I hated jackdaws. I'd be a man someday and I'd come back with a bag of rocks and I'd leave the graveyard littered with dead jackdaws.\nThe morning after Oliver's burial Dad went to the Labour Exchange to sign and collect the week's dole, nineteen shillings and sixpence. He said he'd be home by noon, that he'd get coal and make a fire, that we'd have rashers and eggs and tea in honor of Oliver, that we might even have a sweet or two.\nHe wasn't home by noon, or one, or two, and we boiled and ate the few potatoes the shopkeepers had given the day before. He wasn't home anytime before the sun went down that day in May. There was no sign of him till we heard him, long after the pubs closed, rolling along Windmill Street, singing, When all around a vigil keep, The West's asleep, the West's asleep- Alas, and well may Erin weep When Connacht lies in slumber deep.\nThere lake and plain smile fair and free, 'Mid rocks their guardian chivalry.\nSing, Oh, let man learn liberty\nFrom crashing wind and lashing sea.\nHe stumbled into the room, hanging on to the wall. A snot oozed from his nose and he wiped it away with the back of his hand. He tried to speak. Zeeze shildren should be in bed. Lishen to me. Shildren go to bed.\nMam faced him. These children are hungry. Where's the dole money? We'll get fish and chips so they'll have something in their bellies when they go to sleep.\nShe tried to stick her hands into his pockets but he pushed her away. Have respheck, he said. Reshpeck in front of shildren.\nShe struggled to get at his pockets. Where's the money? The children are hungry. You mad oul' bastard, did you drink all the money again? Just what you did in Brooklyn.\nHe blubbered, Och, poor Angela. And poor wee Margaret and poor wee Oliver.\nHe staggered to me and hugged me and I smelled the drink I used to smell in America. My face was wet from his tears and his spit and his snot and I was hungry and I didn't know what to say when he cried all over my head.\nThen he let me go and hugged Malachy, still going on about the wee sister and the wee brother cold in the ground, and how we all have to pray and be good, how we have to be obedient and do what our mother tells us. He said we have our troubles but it's time for Malachy and me to start school because there's nothing like an education, it will stand to you in the end, and you have to get ready to do your bit for Ireland.\n***\nMam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Windmill Street. She can't sleep with the memory of Oliver in that room, Oliver in the bed, Oliver playing on the floor, Oliver sitting on Dad's lap by the fire. She says it's not good for Eugene to be in that place, that a twin will suffer more over the loss of his brother than even a mother can understand. There's a room going on Hartstonge Street with two beds instead of the one we have here for the six of us, no, the five of us. We're getting that room and to make sure she's going to the Labour Exchange on Thursday to stand in the queue to take the dole money the minute it's handed to Dad. He says she can't do that, he'd be disgraced with the other men. The Labour Exchange is a place for men not for women taking the money from under their noses. She says, Pity about you. If you didn't squander the money in the pubs I wouldn't have to follow you the way I did in Brooklyn.\nHe tells her he'll be shamed forever. She says she doesn't care. She wants that room on Hartstonge Street, a nice warm comfortable room with a lavatory down the hall like the one in Brooklyn, a room without fleas and the dampness that kills. She wants that room because it's on the same street as Leamy's National School and Malachy and I can come home at the dinner hour, which is noon, for a cup of tea and a cut of fried bread.\nOn Thursday Mam follows Dad to the Labour Exchange. She marches in behind him and when the man pushes the money toward Dad she takes it. The other men on the dole nudge each other and grin and Dad is disgraced because a woman is never supposed to interfere with a man's dole money. He might want to put sixpence on a horse or have a pint and if all the women start acting like Mam the horses will stop running and Guinness will go broke. But she has the money now and we move to Hartstonge Street. Then she carries Eugene in her arms and we go up the street to Leamy's National School. The headmaster, Mr. Scallan, says we are to\nreturn on Monday with a composition book, a pencil, and a pen with a good nib on it. We are not to come to school with ringworm or lice and our noses are to be blown at all times, not on the floor, that spreads the consumption, or on our sleeves, but in a handkerchief or a clean rag. He asks us if we are good boys and when we say we are, he says, Good Lord, what's this? Are they Yanks or what?\nMam tells him about Margaret and Oliver and he says, Lord above, Lord above, there's great suffering in the world. Anyway, we'll put the little fellow, Malachy, in the infants' class and his brother in first class. They're in the same room with one master. Monday morning, then, nine o'clock prompt.\nThe boys in Leamy's want to know why we talk like that. Are ye Yanks or what? And when we tell them we came from America they want to know, Are ye gangsters or cowboys?\nA big boy sticks his face up to mine. I'm asking ye a question, he says. Are ye gangsters or cowboys?\nI tell him I don't know and when he pokes his finger into my chest Malachy says, I'm a gangster, Frank's a cowboy. The big boy says, Your little brother is smart and you're a stupid Yank.\nThe boys around him are excited. Fight, they yell, fight, and he pushes me so hard I fall. I want to cry but the blackness comes over me the way it did with Freddie Leibowitz and I rush at him, kicking and punching. I knock him down and try to grab his hair to bang his head on the ground but there's a sharp sting across the backs of my legs and I'm pulled away from him.\nMr. Benson, the master, has me by the ear and he's whacking me across the legs. You little hooligan, he says. Is that the kind of behavior you brought from America? Well, by God, you'll behave yourself before I'm done with you.\nHe tells me hold out one hand and then the other and hits me with his stick once on each hand. Go home now, he says, and tell your mother what a bad boy you were. You're a bad Yank. Say after me, I'm a bad boy.\nI'm a bad boy.\nNow say, I'm a bad Yank.\nI'm a bad Yank.\nMalachy says, He's not a bad boy. It's that big boy. He said we\nwere cowboys and gangsters.\nIs that what you did, Heffernan?\nI was only jokin', sir.\nNo more joking, Heffernan. It's not their fault that they're Yanks. 'Tisn't, sir.\nAnd you, Heffernan, should get down on your two knees every night\nand thank God you're not a Yank for if you were, Heffernan, you'd be the greatest gangster on two sides of the Atlantic. Al Capone would be coming to you for lessons. You're not to be bothering these two Yanks anymore, Heffernan.\nI won't, sir.\nAnd if you do, Heffernan, I'll hang your pelt on the wall. Now go home, all of ye.\nThere are seven masters in Leamy's National School and they all have leather straps, canes, blackthorn sticks. They hit you with the sticks on the shoulders, the back, the legs, and, especially, the hands. If they hit you on the hands it's called a slap. They hit you if you're\nlate, if you have a leaky nib on your pen, if you laugh, if you talk, and if you don't know things.\nThey hit you if you don't know why God made the world, if you don't know the patron saint of Limerick, if you can't recite the Apostles' Creed, if you can't add nineteen to forty-seven, if you can't subtract nineteen from forty-seven, if you don't know the chief towns and products of the thirty-two counties of Ireland, if you can't find Bulgaria on the wall map of the world that's blotted with spit, snot, and blobs of ink thrown by angry pupils expelled forever.\nThey hit you if you can't say your name in Irish, if you can't say the Hail Mary in Irish, if you can't ask for the lavatory pass in Irish. It helps to listen to the big boys ahead of you. They can tell you\nabout the master you have now, what he likes and what he hates.\nOne master will hit you if you don't know that Eamon De Valera is\nthe greatest man that ever lived. Another master will hit you if you don't know that Michael Collins was the greatest man that ever lived.\nMr. Benson hates America and you have to remember to hate America or he'll hit you.\nMr. O'Dea hates England and you have to remember to hate England or he'll hit you.\nIf you ever say anything good about Oliver Cromwell they'll all hit\nyou.\nEven if they slap you six times on each hand with the ash plant or\nthe blackthorn with the knobs you must not cry. You'll be a sissy. There are boys who might jeer at you and mock you on the street but even they have to be careful because the day will come when the master hits and slaps them and they have to keep the tears behind their eyes or be disgraced forever. Some boys say it is better to cry because that pleases the masters. If you don't cry the masters hate you because you've made them look weak before the class and they promise themselves the next time they have you up they'll draw tears or blood or both.\nBig boys in fifth class tell us Mr. O'Dea likes to get you in front of the class so that he can stand behind you, pinch your sideburns, which are called cossicks, pull up on them. Up, up, he says, till you're on tiptoe and the tears are filling your eyes. You don't want the boys in the class to see you cry but pulling on the cossicks makes the tears come whether you like it or not and the master likes that. Mr. O'Dea is the one master who can always bring the tears and the shame.\nIt is better not to cry because you have to stick with the boys in the school and you never want to give the masters any satisfaction.\nIf the master hits you there's no use complaining to your father or mother. They always say, You deserve it. Don't be a baby.\nI know Oliver is dead and Malachy knows Oliver is dead but Eugene is too small to know anything. When he wakes in the morning he says, Ollie, Ollie, and toddles around the room looking under the beds or he climbs up on the bed by the window and points to children on the street, especially children with fair hair like him and Oliver. Ollie, Ollie, he says, and Mam picks him up, sobs, hugs him. He struggles to get down because he doesn't want to be picked up and hugged. He wants to find Oliver.\nDad and Mam tell him Oliver is in heaven playing with angels and we'll all see him again someday but he doesn't understand because he's only two and doesn't have the words and that's the worst thing in the whole world.\nMalachy and I play with him. We try to make him laugh. We make funny faces. We put pots on our heads and pretend to let them fall off. We run across the room and pretend to fall down. We take him to the People's Park to see the lovely flowers, play with dogs, roll in the grass.\nHe sees small children with fair hair like Oliver. He doesn't say Ollie anymore. He only points.\nDad says Eugene is lucky to have brothers like Malachy and me because we help him forget and soon, with God's help, he'll have no memory of Oliver at all.\n***\nHe died anyway.\nSix months after Oliver went, we woke on a mean November morning\nand there was Eugene, cold in the bed beside us. Dr. Troy came and said that child died of pneumonia and why wasn't he in the hospital long ago? Dad said he didn't know and Mam said she didn't know and Dr. Troy said that's why children die. People don't know. He said if Malachy or I showed the slightest sign of a cough or the faintest rattle in the throat we were to be brought to him no matter what time of day or night. We were to be kept dry at all times because there seemed to be a bit of a weakness in the chest in this family. He told Mam he was very sorry for her troubles and he'd give her a prescription for something to ease the pain of the days to come. He said God was asking too much, too damn much.\nGrandma came over to our room with Aunt Aggie. She washed Eugene, and Aunt Aggie went to a shop for a little white gown and a set of rosary beads. They dressed him in a white gown and laid him on the bed by the window where he used to look out for Oliver. They placed his hands on his chest, one hand on top of the other, bound in the little white rosary beads. Grandma brushed the hair back from his eyes and forehead and she said, Doesn't he have lovely soft silky hair? Mam went to the bed and pulled a blanket over his legs to keep him warm. Grandma and Aunt Aggie looked at each other and said nothing. Dad stood at the end of the bed beating his fists against his thighs, talking to Eugene, telling him, Och, it was the River Shannon that harmed you, the dampness from that river that came and took you and Oliver. Grandma said, Will you stop that? You're making the whole house nervous. She took Dr. Troy's prescription and told me run over to O'Connor the chemist for the pills, that there would be no charge due to the kindness of Dr. Troy. Dad said he'd come with me, that we'd go to the Jesuit church and say a prayer for Margaret and Oliver and Eugene, all happy in heaven. The chemist gave us the pills, we stopped to say the prayers, and when we returned to the room, Grandma gave Dad money to bring a few bottles of stout from the pub. Mam said, No, no, but Grandma said, He doesn't have the pills to ease him, God help us, and a bottle of stout will be some small comfort. Then she told him he'd have to go to the undertaker tomorrow to bring the coffin back in a carriage. She told me to go with my father and make sure he didn't stay in the pub all night and drink all the money. Dad said, Och, Frankie shouldn't be in pubs, and she said, Then don't stay there. He put on his cap and we went to South's pub and he told me at the door I could go home now, that he'd be home after one pint. I said, No, and he said, Don't be disobedient. Go home to your poor mother. I said, No, and he said I was a bad boy and God would be displeased. I said I wasn't going home without him and he said, Och, what is the world coming to? He had one quick pint of porter in the pub and we went home with the bottles\nof stout. Pa Keating was in our room with a small bottle of whiskey and bottles of stout and Uncle Pat Sheehan brought two bottles of stout for himself. Uncle Pat sat on the floor with his arms around his bottles and he kept saying, They're mine, they're mine, for fear they'd be taken from him. People who were dropped on their heads always worry someone will steal their stout. Grandma said, All right, Pat, drink your stout yourself. No one will bother you. She and Aunt Aggie sat on the bed by Eugene. Pa Keating sat at the kitchen table drinking his stout and offering everyone a sip of his whiskey. Mam took her pills and sat by the fire with Malachy on her lap. She kept saying Malachy had hair like Eugene and Aunt Aggie said no he did not till Grandma drove her elbow into Aunt Aggie's chest and told her shut up. Dad stood against the wall drinking his stout between the fireplace and the bed with Eugene. Pa Keating told stories and the big people laughed even though they didn't want to laugh or they weren't supposed to laugh in the presence of a dead child. He said when he was in the English army in France the Germans sent gas over which made him so sick they had to take him to the hospital. They kept him in the hospital a while and then sent him back to the trenches. English soldiers were sent home but they didn't give a fiddler's fart about the Irish soldiers, whether they lived or died. Instead of dying Pa made a vast fortune. He said he solved one of the great problems of trench warfare. In the trenches it was so wet and muddy they had no way of boiling the water for the tea. He said to himself, Jasus, I have all this gas in my system and 'tis a great pity to waste it. So he shoved a pipe up his arse, lit a match to it, and there in a second he had a fine flame ready to boil water in any billycan. Tommies came running from trenches all around when they heard the news and they gave him any amount of money if he'd let them boil water. He made so much money he was able to bribe the generals to let him out of the army and off he went to Paris where he had a fine time drinking wine with artists and models. He had such a high time of it he spent all his money and when he came back to Limerick the only job he could get was in the gas works shoveling coal into the furnaces. He said there was so much gas in his system now he could supply light to a small town for a year. Aunt Aggie sniffed and said that was not a proper story to be telling in the presence of a dead child and Grandma said it was better to have a story like that than to be sitting around with the long face. Uncle Pat Sheehan, sitting on the floor with his stout, said he was going to sing a song. More power to you, said Pa Keating, and Uncle Pat sang \"The Road to Rasheen. \" He kept saying, Rasheen, Rasheen, mavourneen mean, and the song made no sense because his father dropped him on his head long ago and every time he sang that song he had different words. Grandma said that was a fine song and Pa Keating said Caruso better look over his shoulder. Dad went over to the bed in the corner where he slept with Mam. He sat on the edge, put his bottle on the floor, covered his face with his hands and cried. He said, Frank, Frank, come here, and I had to go to him so that he could hug me the way Mam was hugging Malachy. Grandma said, We better go now and sleep a bit before the funeral tomorrow. They each knelt by the bed and said a prayer and kissed Eugene's forehead. Dad put me down, stood up and nodded to them as they left. When they were gone he lifted each of the stout bottles to his mouth and drained it. He ran his finger inside the whiskey bottle and licked it. He turned down the flame in the paraffin oil lamp on the table and said it was time for Malachy and me to be in bed. We'd have to sleep with him and Mam that\nnight as little Eugene would be needing the bed for himself. It was dark in the room now except for the sliver of streetlight that fell on Eugene's lovely soft silky hair.\nDad lights the fire in the morning, makes the tea, toasts the bread in the fire. He brings Mam's toast and tea but she waves it away and turns to the wall. He brings Malachy and me to Eugene to kneel and say a prayer. He says the prayers of one child like us are worth more in heaven than the prayers of ten cardinals and forty bishops. He shows us how to bless ourselves, In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen, and he says, Dear God, this is what you want, isn't it? You want my son, Eugene. You took his brother, Oliver, You took his sister, Margaret. I'm not supposed to question that, am I? Dear God above, I don't know why children have to die but that is Your will. You told the river to kill and the Shannon killed. Could You at last be merciful? Could You leave us the children we have? That is all we ask. Amen.\nHe helps Malachy and me wash our heads and feet so that we'll be clean for Eugene's funeral. We have to be very quiet even when he hurts us cleaning our ears with the corner of the towel we brought from America. We have to be quiet because Eugene is there with his eyes closed and we don't want him to be waking up and looking out the window for Oliver.\nGrandma comes and tells Mam she has to get up. There are children dead, she says, but there are children alive and they need their mother. She brings Mam a little tea in a mug to wash down the pills that ease the pain. Dad tells Grandma it's Thursday and he has to go to the Labour Exchange for the dole and then down to the undertaker to bring the mourning carriage and the coffin. Grandma tells him to take me with him but he says it's better for me to stay with Malachy so that I can pray for my little brother dead in the bed. Grandma says, Is it coddin' me you are? Pray for a little child that's barely two and already playing with his little brother in heaven? You'll take your son with you and he'll remind you this is no day for the pubs. She looks at him and he looks at her and he puts on his cap.\nAt the Labour Exchange we stand at the end of the queue till a man comes from behind the counter and tells Dad he's very sorry for his troubles and he should go ahead of everyone else on this sorrowful day. Men touch their caps and say they're sorry for his troubles and some pat my head and give me pennies, twenty-four pennies, two shillings. Dad tells me I'm rich now and I should buy myself a sweet while he goes into this place for a minute. I know this place is a pub and I know he wants to get the black stuff that is called a pint but I don't say anything because I want to go to the shop next door for a piece of toffee. I chew my toffee till it melts and leaves my mouth all sweet and sticky. Dad is still in the pub and I wonder if I should get another piece of toffee as long as he's in there with the pint. I'm about to give the money to the woman in the shop when my hand is slapped down and there's Aunt Aggie, raging. Is this what you do, she says, on the day of your brother's funeral? Gorgin' yourself on sweets. And where's that father of yours?\nHe's, he's, in the pub.\nOf course he's in the pub. You out here stuffin' yourself with sweets and him in there gettin' himself into a staggerin' condition the day your poor little brother goes to the graveyard.\nShe tells the shop woman, Just like his father, the same odd manner, the same oul' northern jaw. She tells me get into that pub and tell my father to stop the drinking and get the coffin and the carriage. She will not set foot inside the pub for the drink is the curse of this poor godforsaken country.\nDad is sitting at the back of the pub with a man who has a dirty face and hair growing out of his nose. They're not talking but staring straight ahead and their black pints are resting on a small white coffin on the seat between them. I know that's Eugene's coffin because Oliver had one like it and I want to cry when I see the black pints on top of it. I'm sorry now I ever ate that toffee and I wish I could take it out of my stomach and give it back to the woman in the shop because it's not right to be eating toffee when Eugene is dead in the bed and I'm frightened by the two black pints on his white coffin. The man with Dad is saying, No, mister, you can't leave a child's coffin in a carriage no more. I did that once, went in for a pint and they robbed that little coffin out of the bloody carriage. Can you credit that? It was empty, thank God, but there you are. Desperate times we live in, desperate. The man with Dad lifts his pint and takes a long swallow and when he puts his glass down there's a hollow sound in the coffin. Dad nods at me. We'll be going in a minute, son, but when he goes to put his glass on the coffin after the long swallow I push it away.\nThat's Eugene's coffin. I'll tell Mam you put your glass on Eugene's coffin.\nNow, son. Now, son.\nDad, that's Eugene's coffin. The other man says, Will we have another pint, mister?\nDad says to me, Wait outside another few minutes, Francis. No.\nDon't be a bad boy.\nNo.\nThe other man says, By Jesus, if that was my son I'd kick his arse from here to the County Kerry. He have no right to be talkin' to his father in that manner on a sorrowful day. If a man can't have a pint the day of a funeral what's the use of livin' at all, at all.\nDad says, All right. We'll go.\nThey finish their pints and wipe the wet brown stains off the coffin with their sleeves. The man climbs up to the driver's seat of the carriage and Dad and I ride inside. He has the coffin on his lap and he presses it against his chest. At home our room is filled with big people, Mam, Grandma, Aunt Aggie, her husband, Pa Keating, Uncle Pat Sheehan, Uncle Tom Sheehan, who is Mam's oldest brother and who never came near us before because he hates people from the North of Ireland. Uncle Tom has his wife, Jane, with him. She's from Galway and people say she has the look of a Spaniard and that's why no one in the family talks to her.\nThe man takes the coffin from Dad and when he brings it into the room Mam moans, Oh, no, oh, God, no. The man tells Grandma he'll be back in awhile to take us to the graveyard. Grandma tells him he'd better not come back to this house in a drunken state because this child that's going to the graveyard suffered greatly and deserves a bit of dignity and she won't put up with a driver that's drunk and ready to fall out of the high seat.\nThe man says, Missus, I drove dozens o' children to the graveyard an' never once fell out of any seat, high or low.\nThe men are drinking stout from bottles again and the women are sipping sherry from jam jars. Uncle Pat Sheehan tells everyone, This is my stout, this is my stout, and Grandma says, 'Tis all right, Pat. No one will take your stout. Then he says he wants to sing \"The Road to Rasheen\" till Pa Keating says, No, Pat, you can't sing on the day of a funeral. You can sing the night before. But Uncle Pat keeps saying, This is my stout and I want to sing \"The Road to Rasheen, \" and everyone knows he talks like that because he was dropped on his head. He starts to sing his song but stops when Grandma takes the lid off the coffin and Mam sobs, Oh, Jesus, oh, Jesus, will it ever stop? Will I be left with one child?\nMam is sitting on a chair at the head of the bed. She's stroking Eugene's hair and face and hands. She tells him that of all the children in the world he was the sweetest and the most delicate and loving. She tells him 'tis a terrible thing to lose him but isn't he in heaven now with his brother and his sister and isn't that a comfort to us, knowing Oliver is no longer lonesome for his twin. Still, she puts her head down next to Eugene and cries so hard all the women in the room cry with her. She cries till Pa Keating tells her we have to go before the darkness falls, that we can't be in graveyards in the dark.\nGrandma whispers to Aunt Aggie, Who'll put the child in the coffin? and Aunt Aggie whispers, I won't. That's the job for the mother.\nUncle Pat hears them. I'll put the child in the coffin, he says. He limps to the bed and places his arms around Mam's shoulders. She looks up at him and her face is drenched. He says, I'll put the child in the coffin, Angela.\nOh, Pat, she says. Pat.\nI can do it, he says. Sure he's only a small child an' I never lifted a small child before in my life. I never had a small child in me arms. I won't drop him, Angela. I won't. Honest to God, I won't.\nI know you won't, Pat. I know you won't.\nI'll lift him an' I won't be singin'\"The Road to Rasheen.\"\nI know you won't, Pat, Mam says.\nPat pulls down the blanket Mam put there to keep Eugene warm.\nEugene's feet are white and bright with little blue veins. Pat bends over, picks up Eugene and holds him against his chest. He kisses Eugene's forehead and then everyone in the room kisses Eugene. He places Eugene in the coffin and steps back. We are all gathered around looking at Eugene for the last time.\nUncle Pat says, See, I didn't drop him, Angela, and she touches his\nface.\nAunt Aggie goes to the pub for the driver. He puts the lid on the\ncoffin and screws it down. He says, Who's comin' in the carriage? and takes the coffin to the carriage. There's room only for Mam and Dad, Malachy and me. Grandma says, Ye go ahead to the graveyard and we'll wait here.\nI don't know why we can't keep Eugene. I don't know why they have to send him away with that man who puts his pint on the white coffin. I don't know why they had to send Margaret away and Oliver. It is a bad thing to put my sister and my brothers in a box and I wish I could say something to someone.\nThe horse clop-clopped through the streets of Limerick. Malachy said, Are we going to see Oliver? and Dad said, No, Oliver is in heaven and don't ask me what heaven is because I don't know.\nMam said, Heaven is a place where Oliver and Eugene and Margaret are happy and warm and we'll see them there some day.\nMalachy said, The horse did his doodoo on the street and there was a smell, and Mam and Dad had to smile.\nAt the graveyard the driver climbs down and opens the door of the carriage. Gimme that coffin, he says, an' I'll carry it up to the grave. He yanks at the coffin and stumbles. Mam says, You're not carrying my child in the condition you're in. She turns to Dad. You carry him, she says. Do what you like, says the driver.\nDo what you bloody well like, and he climbs up to his seat.\nIt's getting dark now and the coffin seems whiter than ever in Dad's arms. Mam takes our hands and we follow Dad through the graves. The jackdaws are quiet in the trees because their day is nearly over and they have to rest so that they can get up early in the morning and feed their babies.\nTwo men with shovels are waiting by a small open grave. One man says, Ye are very late. Good thing this is a small job or we'd be gone. He climbs into the grave. Hand it to me, he says, and Dad hands him the coffin.\nThe man sprinkles some straw and grass on the coffin and as he climbs out the other man shovels in the earth. Mam lets out a long cry, Oh, Jesus, Jesus, and a jackdaw croaks in a tree. I wish I had a rock to hit that jackdaw. When the men finish shoveling in the earth they wipe their foreheads and wait. One says, Ah, well, now, there's usually a little something for the thirst that's in it.\nDad says, Oh, yes, yes, and gives them money. They say, Sorry for your troubles, and they leave.\nWe make our way back to the carriage at the graveyard gate but the carriage is gone. Dad looks around in the darkness and comes back shaking his head. Mam says, That driver is nothing but a dirty old drunkard, God forgive me.\nIt's a long walk from the graveyard to our room. Mam tells Dad, These children need some nourishment and you have money left from the dole this morning. If you're thinking of going to the pubs tonight you can forget it. We're taking them to Naughton's and they can have fish and chips and lemonade for 'tisn't every day they bury a brother.\nThe fish and chips are delicious with vinegar and salt and the lemonade is tart in our throats.\nWhen we get home the room is empty. There are empty stout bottles on the table and the fire is out. Dad lights the paraffin oil lamp and you can see the hollow left in the pillow by Eugene's head. You expect to hear him and see him toddling across the room, climbing up on the bed to look out the window for Oliver.\nDad tells Mam he's going out for a walk. She says no. She knows what he's up to, that he can't wait to spend his last few shillings in the pubs. All right, he says. He lights the fire and Mam makes tea and soon we're in bed.\nMalachy and I are back in the bed where Eugene died. I hope he's not cold in that white coffin in the graveyard though I know he's not there anymore because angels come to the graveyard and open the coffin and he's far from the Shannon dampness that kills, up in the sky in heaven with Oliver and Margaret where they have plenty of fish and chips and toffee and no aunts to bother you, where all the fathers bring home\nthe money from the Labour Exchange and you don't have to be running around to pubs to find them.\nIII\nMam says she can't spend another minute in that room on Hartstonge Street. She sees Eugene morning, noon and night. She sees him climbing the bed to look out at the street for Oliver and sometimes she sees Oliver outside and Eugene inside, the two of them chatting away. She's happy they're chatting like that but she doesn't want to be seeing and hearing them the rest of her life. It's a shame to move when we're so near Leamy's National School but if she doesn't move soon she'll go out of her mind and wind up in the lunatic asylum.\nWe move to Roden Lane on top of a place called Barrack Hill. There are six houses on one side of the lane, one on the opposite side. The houses are called two up, two down, two rooms on top, two on the bottom. Our house is at the end of the lane, the last of the six. Next to our door is a small shed, a lavatory, and next to that a stable.\nMam goes to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to see if there's any chance of getting furniture. The man says he'll give us a docket for a table, two chairs, and two beds. He says we'll have to go to a second- hand furniture shop down in the Irishtown and haul the furniture home ourselves. Mam says we can use the pram she had for the twins and when she says that she cries. She wipes her eyes on her sleeves and asks the man if the beds we're getting are secondhand. He says of course they are, and she says she's very worried about sleeping in beds someone might have died in, especially if they had the consumption. The man says, I'm very sorry, but beggars can't be choosers.\nIt takes us all day to haul the furniture on the pram from one end of Limerick to the other. There are four wheels on the pram but one is bockety, it wants to go in a different direction. We have two beds, one sideboard with a mirror, a table and two chairs. We're happy with the house. We can walk from room to room and up and down the stairs. You feel very rich when you can go up and down the stairs all day as much as you please. Dad lights the fire and Mam makes the tea. He sits at the table on one chair, she sits on the other and Malachy and I sit on the trunk we brought from America. While we're drinking our tea an old man passes our door with a bucket in his hand. He empties the bucket into the lavatory and flushes and there's a powerful stink in our kitchen. Mam goes to the door and says, Why are you emptying your bucket in our lavatory? He raises his cap to her. Your lavatory, missus? Ah, no. You're making a bit of a mistake there, ha, ha. This is not your lavatory. Sure, isn't this the lavatory for the whole lane. You'll see passing your door here the buckets of eleven families and I can tell you it gets very powerful here in the warm weather, very powerful altogether. 'Tis December now, thank God, with a chill in the air and Christmas around the corner and the lavatory isn't that bad, but the day will come when you'll be calling for a gas mask. So, good night to you, missus, and I hope you'll be happy in your house.\nMam says, Wait a minute, sir. Could you tell me who cleans this lavatory?\nCleans? Ah, Jasus, that's a good one. Cleans, she says. Is it joking you are? These houses were built in the time of Queen Victoria herself and if this lavatory was ever cleaned it must have been done by someone in the middle of the night when no one was lookin'.\nAnd he shuffles up the lane laughing away to himself.\nMam comes back to her chair and her tea. We can't stay here, she says. That lavatory will kill us with all diseases.\nDad says, We can't move again. Where will we get a house for six shillings a week? We'll keep the lavatory clean ourselves. We'll boil buckets of water and throw them in there.\nOh, will we? says Mam, and where will we get the coal or turf or blocks to be boiling water?\nDad says nothing. He finishes his tea and looks for a nail to hang our one picture. The man in the picture has a thin face. He wears a yellow skullcap and a black robe with a cross on his chest. Dad says he was a Pope, Leo the Thirteenth, a great friend of the workingman. He brought this picture all the way from America where he found it thrown out by someone who had no time for the workingman. Mam says he's talking a lot of bloody nonsense and he says she shouldn't say bloody in front of the children. Dad finds a nail but wonders how he's going to get it into the wall without a hammer. Mam says he could go borrow one from the people next door but he says you don't go around borrowing from people you don't know. He leans the picture against the wall and drives the nail with the bottom of a jam jar. The jam jar breaks and cuts his hand and a blob of blood falls on the Pope's head. He wraps his hand in the dish rag and tells Mam, Quick, quick, wipe the blood off the Pope before it dries. She tries to wipe the blood away with her sleeve but it's wool and spreads the blood till the whole side of the Pope's face is smeared. Dad says, Lord above, Angela, you've destroyed the Pope entirely, and she says, Arrah, stop your whining, we'll get some paint and go over his face some day, and Dad says, He's the only Pope that was ever a friend to the workingman and what are we to say if someone from the St. Vincent de Paul Society comes in and sees blood all over him? Mam says, I don't know. It's your blood and 'tis a sad thing when a man can't even drive a nail straight. It just goes to show how useless you are. You'd be better off digging fields and anyway I don't care. I have pain in my back and I'm going to bed.\nOch, what am I going to do? Dad says.\nTake down the Pope and hide him in the coal hole under the stairs where he won't be seen and he'll be out of harm's way.\nI can't, says Dad. It would be bad luck. Coal hole is no place for a Pope. When the Pope is up, he's up.\nSuit yourself, says Mam.\nI will, says Dad.\nThis is our first Christmas in Limerick and the girls are out in\nthe lane, skipping rope and singing, Christmas is coming And the goose is getting fat, Please put a penny In the old man's hat.\nIf you haven't a penny\nA ha'penny will do\nAnd if you haven't a ha'penny\nGod bless you.\nBoys tease the girls and call out,\nMay your mother have an accident\nAbroad in the loo.\nMam says she'd like to have a nice Christmas dinner but what can you do when the Labour Exchange reduces the dole to sixteen shillings after Oliver and Eugene died? You pay the rent of six shillings, you have ten shillings left, and what use is that to four people?\nDad can't get any work. He gets up early on weekdays, lights the fire, boils water for the tea and his shaving mug. He puts on a shirt and attaches a collar with studs. He puts on his tie and his cap and goes to the Labour Exchange to sign for the dole. He will never leave the house without collar and tie. A man without collar and tie is a man with no respect for himself. You never know when the clerk at the Labour Exchange might tell you there's a job going at Rank's Flour Mills or the Limerick Cement Company, and even if it's a laboring job what will they think if you appear without collar and tie?\nBosses and foremen always show him respect and say they're ready to hire him, but when he opens his mouth and they hear the North of Ireland accent, they take a Limerickman instead. That's what he tells Mam by the fire and when she says, Why don't you dress like a proper workingman? he says he'll never give an inch, never let them know, and when she says, Why can't you try to talk like a Limerickman? he says he'll never sink that low and the greatest sorrow of his life is that his sons are now afflicted with the Limerick accent. She says, Sorry for your troubles and I hope that's all you'll ever have, and he says that some day, with God's help, we'll get out of Limerick and far from the Shannon that kills.\nI ask Dad what afflicted means and he says, Sickness, son, and things that don't fit.\nWhen he's not looking for work Dad goes for long walks, miles into the country. He asks farmers if they need any help, that he grew up on a farm and can do anything. If they hire him he goes to work right away with his cap on and his collar and tie. He works so hard and long the farmers have to tell him to stop. They wonder how a man can work through a long hot day with no thought of food or drink. Dad smiles. He never brings home the money he earns on farms. That money seems to be different from the dole, which is supposed to be brought home. He takes the farm money to the pub and drinks it. If he's not home when the Angelus rings at six o'clock Mam knows he had a day of work. She hopes he might think of his family and pass the pub even once, but he never does. She hopes he might bring home something from the farm, potatoes, cabbage, turnips, carrots, but he'll never bring home anything because he'd never stoop so low as to ask a farmer for anything. Mam says 'tis all right for her to be begging at the St. Vincent de Paul Society for a docket for food but he can't stick a few spuds in his pocket. He says it's different for a man. You have to keep the dignity. Wear your collar and tie, keep up the appearance, and never ask for anything. Mam says, I hope it keeps fine for you.\nWhen the farm money is gone he rolls home singing and crying over Ireland and his dead children, mostly about Ireland. If he sings Roddy McCorley, it means he had only the price of a pint or two. If he sings Kevin Barry, it means he had a good day, that he is now falling down drunk and ready to get us out of bed, line us up and make us promise to die for Ireland, unless Mam tells him leave us alone or she'll brain him with the poker.\nYou wouldn't do that, Angela.\nI would and more. You better stop the nonsense and go to bed.\nBed, bed, bed. What's the use of going to bed? If I go to bed I'll\nonly have to get up again and I can't sleep in a place where there's a river sending poison to us in mist and fog.\nHe goes to bed, pounds the wall with his fist, sings a woeful song, falls asleep. He's up at daylight because no one should sleep beyond the dawn. He wakes Malachy and me and we're tired from being kept up the night before with his talking and singing. We complain and say we're sick, we're tired, but he pulls back the overcoats that cover us and forces us out on the floor. It's December and it's freezing and we can see our breath. We pee into the bucket by the bedroom door and run down stairs for the warmth of the fire Dad has already started. We wash our faces and hands in a basin that sits under the water tap by the door. The pipe that leads to the tap has to be held to the wall by a piece of twine looped around a nail. Everything around the tap is damp, the floor, the wall, the chair the basin sits on. The water from the tap is icy and our fingers turn numb. Dad says this is good for us, it will make men of us. He throws the icy water on his face and neck and chest to show there's nothing to fear. We hold our hands to the fire for the heat that's in it but we can't stay there long because we have to drink our tea and eat our bread and go to school. Dad makes us say grace before meals and grace after meals and he tells us be good boys at school because God is watching every move and the slightest disobedience will send us straight to hell where we'll never have to worry about the cold again.\nAnd he smiles.\nTwo weeks before Christmas Malachy and I come home from school in a heavy rain and when we push in the door we find the kitchen empty. The table and chairs and trunk are gone and the fire is dead in the grate. The Pope is still there and that means we haven't moved again. Dad would never move without the Pope. The kitchen floor is wet, little pools of water all around, and the walls are twinkling with the damp. There's a noise upstairs and when we go up we find Dad and Mam and the missing furniture. It's nice and warm there with a fire blazing in the grate, Mam sitting in the bed, and Dad reading The Irish Press and smoking a cigarette by the fire. Mam tells us there was a terrible flood, that the rain came down the lane and poured in under our door. They tried to stop it with rags but they only turned sopping wet and let the rain in. People emptying their buckets made it worse and there was a sickening stink in the kitchen. She thinks we should stay upstairs as long as there is rain. We'll be warm through the winter months and then we can go downstairs in the springtime if there is any sign of a dryness in the walls or the floor. Dad says it's like going away on our holidays to a warm foreign place like Italy. That's what we'll call the upstairs from now on, Italy. Malachy says the Pope is still on the wall downstairs and he's going to be all cold and couldn't we bring him up? but Mam says, No, he's going to stay where he is because I don't want him on the wall glaring at me in the bed. Isn't it enough that we dragged him all the way from Brooklyn to Belfast to Dublin to Limerick? All I want now is a little peace, ease and comfort....\nMam takes Malachy and me to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to stand in the queue and see if there's any chance of getting something for the Christmas dinner-a goose or a ham, but the man says everyone in\nLimerick is desperate this Christmas. He gives her a docket for groceries at McGrath's shop and another one for the butcher.\nNo goose, says the butcher, no ham. No fancy items when you bring the docket from the St. Vincent de Paul. What you can have now, missus, is black pudding and tripe or a sheep's head or a nice pig's head. No harm in a pig's head, missus, plenty of meat and children love it, slice that cheek, slather it with mustard and you're in heaven, though I suppose they wouldn't have the likes of that in America where they're mad for the steak and all classes of poultry, flying, walking or swimming itself.\nHe tells Mam, no, she can't have boiled bacon or sausages and if she has any sense she'll take the pig's head before they're all gone the way the poor people of Limerick are clamoring for them.\nMam says the pig's head isn't right for Christmas and he says 'tis more than the Holy Family had in that cold stable in Bethlehem long ago. You wouldn't find them complaining if someone offered them a nice fat pig's head.\nNo, they wouldn't complain, says Mam, but they'd never eat the pig's head. They were Jewish.\nAnd what does that have to do with it? A pig's head is a pig's head.\nAnd a Jew is a Jew and 'tis against their religion and I don't blame them.\nThe butcher says, Are you a bit of an expert, missus, on the Jews and the pig.\nI am not, says Mam, but there was a Jewish woman, Mrs. Leibowitz, in New York, and I don't know what we would have done without her.\nThe butcher takes the pig's head off a shelf and when Malachy says, Ooh, look at the dead dog, the butcher and Mam burst out laughing. He wraps the head in newspaper, hands it to Mam and says, Happy Christmas. Then he wraps up some sausages and tells her, Take these sausages for your breakfast on Christmas Day. Mam says, Oh, I can't afford sausages, and he says, Am I asking you for money? Am I? Take these sausages. They might help make up for the lack of a goose or a ham.\nSure, you don't have to do that, says Mam.\nI know that, missus. If I had to do it, I wouldn't.\nMam says she has a pain in her back, that I'll have to carry the\npig's head. I hold it against my chest but it's damp and when the newspaper begins to fall away everyone can see the head. Mam says, I'm ashamed of me life that the world should know we're having pig's head for Christmas. Boys from Leamy's National School see me and they point and laugh. Aw, Gawd, look at Frankie McCourt an'his pig's snout. Is that what the Yanks ate for Christmas dinner, Frankie?\nOne calls to another, Hey, Christy, do you know how to ate a pig's\nhead?\nNo, I don't, Paddy.\nGrab him by the ears an' chew the face offa him.\nAnd Christy says, Hey, Paddy, do you know the only part of the pig the McCourts don't ate?\nNo, I don't, Christy.\nThe only part they don't ate is the oink.\nAfter a few streets the newspaper is gone altogether and everyone\ncan see the pig's head. His nose is flat against my chest and pointing up at my chin and I feel sorry for him because he's dead and the world is\nlaughing at him. My sister and two brothers are dead, too, but if anyone laughed at them I'd hit them with a rock.\nI wish Dad would come and help us because Mam has to stop every few steps and lean against a wall. She's holding her back and telling us she'll never be able to climb Barrack Hill. Even if Dad came he wouldn't be much use because he never carries anything, parcels, bags, packages. If you carry such things you lose your dignity. That's what he says. He carried the twins when they were tired and he carried the Pope, but that was not the same as carrying ordinary things like a pig's head. He tells Malachy and me that when you grow up you have to wear a collar and tie and never let people see you carry things.\nHe's upstairs sitting by the fire, smoking a cigarette, reading The Irish Press, which he loves because it's De Valera's paper and he thinks De Valera is the greatest man in the world. He looks at me and the pig's head and tells Mam it's a disgraceful thing to let a boy carry an object like that through the streets of Limerick. She takes off her coat and eases herself into the bed and tells him that next Christmas he can go out and find the dinner. She's worn out and gasping for a cup of tea so would he drop his grand airs, boil the water for the tea and fry some bread before his two small sons starve to death.\nOn Christmas morning he lights the fire early so that we can have sausages and bread and tea. Mam sends me to Grandma to see if we can borrow a pot for the pig's head. Grandma says, What are ye having for yeer dinner? Pig's head! Jesus, Mary an' Joseph, that's goin' beyond the beyonds. Couldn't your father get out and find a ham or a goose at least? What kind of man is he at all, at all?\nMam puts the head in the pot, just covered with water, and while the pig is boiling away Dad takes Malachy and me to Mass at the Redemptorist church. It's warm in the church and sweet with flowers and incense and candles. He takes us to see the Baby Jesus in the crib. He's a big fat baby with fair curls like Malachy. Dad tells us that's Jesus' mother there, Mary, in the blue dress, and his father, St. Joseph, the old man with the beard. He says they're sad because they know Jesus will grow up and be killed so that we can all go to heaven. I ask why the Baby Jesus has to die and Dad says you can't ask questions like that. Malachy says, Why? and Dad tells him be quiet.\nMam is in a terrible state at home. There isn't enough coal to cook the dinner, the water isn't boiling anymore and she says she's demented with worry. We'll have to go down the Dock Road again to see if there's any coal or turf lying around from the lorries. Surely we'll find something on the road this day of all days. Even the poorest of the poor don't go out on Christmas Day picking coal off the road. There's no use asking Dad to go because he will never stoop that low and even if he did he won't carry things through the streets. It's a rule he has. Mam can't go because of the pain in her back.\nShe says, You'll have to go, Frank, and take Malachy with you.\nIt's a long way to the Dock Road but we don't mind because our bellies are filled with sausages and bread and it's not raining. We carry a canvas bag Mam borrowed from Mrs. Hannon next door and Mam is right, there is no one on the Dock Road. The poor are all at home having pig's head or maybe a goose and we have the Dock Road to ourselves. We find bits of coal and turf stuck in cracks on the road and in the walls of the coal yards. We find bits of paper and cardboard that will be useful in starting the fire again. We're wandering around trying to fill the bag\nwhen Pa Keating comes along. He must have washed himself for Christmas because he's not as black as he was when Eugene died. He wants to know what we're doing with that bag and when Malachy tells him he says, Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph! Christmas Day and ye don't have a fire for yeer pig's head. That's a bloody disgrace.\nHe takes us to South's pub, which is not supposed to be open, but he's a regular customer and there's a back door for men who want their pint to celebrate the birthday of the Baby Jesus above in the crib. He orders his pint and lemonade for us and asks the man if there's any chance of getting a few lumps of coal. The man says he's been serving drink for twenty-seven years and nobody ever asked him for coal before. Pa says it would be a favor and the man says if Pa asked for the moon he'd fly up and bring it back. The man leads us to the coal hole under the stairs and tells us take what we can carry. It's real coal and not bits from the Dock Road and if we can't carry it we can drag it along the ground.\nIt takes us a long time to go from South's pub to Barrack Hill because of a hole in the bag. I pull the bag and it's Malachy's job to pick up the lumps that fall through the hole and put them back again. Then it starts to rain and we can't stand in a doorway till it passes because we have that coal and it's leaving a black trail along the pavement and Malachy is turning black from picking up the lumps, pushing them into the bag and wiping the rain from his face with his wet black hands. I tell him he's black, he tells me I'm black, and a woman in a shop tells us get away from that door, 'tis Christmas Day and she doesn't want to be looking at Africa.\nWe have to keep dragging the bag or we'll never have our Christmas dinner. It will take ages to get a fire going and ages more to get our dinner because the water has to be boiling when Mam puts in the head of cabbage and the potatoes to keep the pig company in the pot. We drag the bag up O'Connell Avenue and we see people in their houses sitting around tables with all kinds of decorations and bright lights. At one house they push up the window and the children point and laugh and call to us, Look at the Zulus. Where are yeer spears?\nMalachy makes faces at them and wants to throw coal at them but I tell him if he throws coal there's less for the pig and we'll never get our dinner.\nThe downstairs in our house is a lake again from the rain pouring under the door but it doesn't matter because we're drenched anyway and we can wade through the water. Dad comes down and drags the bag upstairs to Italy. He says we're good boys for getting so much coal, that the Dock Road must have been covered with it. When Mam sees us she starts to laugh, and then she cries. She's laughing because we're so black and crying because we're sopping wet. She tells us take off all our clothes and she washes the coal off our hands and faces. She tells Dad the pig's head can wait a while so that we can have a jam jar of hot tea.\nIt's raining outside and there's a lake downstairs in our kitchen but up here in Italy the fire is going again and the room is so dry and warm that, after our tea, Malachy and I doze off in the bed and we don't wake till Dad tells us the dinner is ready. Our clothes are still wet, so Malachy sits on the trunk at the table wrapped in Mam's red American overcoat and I'm wrapped in an old coat that Mam's father left behind when he went to Australia.\nThere are delicious smells in the room, cabbage, potatoes, and the pig's head, but when Dad lifts the head from the pot to a plate Malachy says, Oh, the poor pig. I don't want to eat the poor pig.\nMam says, If you were hungry you'd eat it. Now stop the nonsense and eat your dinner.\nDad says, Wait a minute. He takes slices from the two cheeks, places them on our plates and smears them with mustard. He takes the plate that holds the pig's head and puts it on the floor under the table. Now, he says to Malachy, that's ham, and Malachy eats it because he's not looking at what it came from and it isn't pig's head anymore. The cabbage is soft and hot and there are plenty of potatoes with butter and salt. Mam peels our potatoes but Dad eats his skin and all. He says all the nourishment of a potato is in the skin and Mam says it's a good thing he's not eating eggs, he'd be chewing the shells and all.\nHe says he would, and it's a disgrace that the Irish throw out millions of potato skins every day and that's why thousands are dying of consumption and surely there's nourishment in the shell of an egg since waste is the eighth deadly sin. If he had his way, and Mam says, Never mind your way. Eat your dinner.\nHe eats half a potato with its skin on and puts the other half back in the pot. He eats a small slice of the pig's cheek and a leaf of cabbage and leaves the rest on his plate for Malachy and me. He makes more tea and we have that with bread and jam so that no one can say we didn't have a sweet on Christmas Day.\nIt's dark now and still raining outside and the coal is glowing in the grate where Mam and Dad sit and smoke their cigarettes. There's nothing to do when your clothes are wet but get back into bed where it's cozy and your father can tell you a story about how Cuchulain became a Catholic and you fall asleep and dream about the pig standing in the crib at the Redemptorist church crying because he and the Baby Jesus and Cuchulain all have to grow up and die.\nThe angel that brought Margaret and the twins comes again and brings us another brother, Michael. Dad says he found Michael on the seventh step of the stairs to Italy. He says that's what you have to watch for when you ask for a new baby, the Angel on the Seventh Step.\nMalachy wants to know how you can get a new brother from the Angel on the Seventh Step if you don't have any stairs in your house and Dad tells him that asking too many questions is an affliction.\nMalachy wants to know what an affliction is.\nAffliction. I'd like to know what that word means. Affliction, but Dad says, Och, child, the world is an affliction and everything in it, puts on his cap and goes to the Bedford Row Hospital to see Mam and Michael. She's in the hospital with the pain in her back and she has the baby with her to make sure he was healthy when he was left on the seventh step. I don't understand this because I'm sure angels would never leave a sick baby on the seventh step. There's no use asking Dad or Mam about this. They say, You're getting as bad as your brother for asking questions. Go play.\nI know that big people don't like questions from children. They can ask all the questions they like, How's school? Are you a good boy? Did you say your prayers? but if you ask them did they say their prayers you might be hit on the head.\nDad brings Mam home with the new baby and she has to stay in bed for a few days with the pain in her back. She says this baby is the\nspitting image of our sister who died, with his wavy black hair, his lovely blue eyes, and the gorgeous eyebrows. That's what Mam says.\nI want to know if the baby will be spitting. I also want to know which is the seventh step because there are nine steps on the stairs and I'd like to know if you count from the bottom or the top. Dad doesn't mind answering this question. Angels come down from above, he says, and not up from kitchens like ours which are lakes from October till April.\nSo I find the seventh step by counting from the top.\nThe baby Michael has a cold. His head is stuffed and he can barely breathe. Mam worries because it's Sunday and the Dispensary for the poor is closed. If you go to the doctor's house and the maid sees you're from the lower classes she tells you go to the Dispensary where you belong. If you tell her the child is dying in your arms she'll say the doctor is in the country riding his horse.\nMam cries because the baby is struggling to get air through his mouth. She tries to clear his nostrils with a bit of rolled up paper but she's afraid to push it too far up. Dad says, There's no need for that. You're not supposed to be pushing things inside a child's head. It looks like he's going to kiss the baby. Instead, he has his mouth on the little nose and he's sucking sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head. He spits it into the fire, Michael gives out a loud cry and you can see him drawing the air into his head and kicking his legs and laughing. Mam looks at Dad as if he just came down from heaven and Dad says, That's what we did in Antrim long before there were doctors riding their horses.\nMichael entitles us to a few extra shillings on the dole but Mam says it isn't enough and now she has to go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society for food. One night there is a knock on the door and Mam sends me down to see who it is. There are two men from the St. Vincent de Paul and they want to see my mother and father. I tell them my parents are upstairs in Italy and they say, What?\nUpstairs where 'tis dry. I'll tell them.\nThey want to know what that little shed is beside our front door. I tell them it's the lavatory. They want to know why it isn't in the back of the house and I tell them it's the lavatory for the whole lane and it's a good thing it's not in the back of our house or we'd have people traipsing through our kitchen with buckets that would make you sick.\nThey say, Are you sure there's one lavatory for the whole lane? I am.\nThey say, Mother of God.\nMam calls down from Italy. Who's down there?\nThe men.\nWhat men? From the St. Vincent de Paul.\nThey're careful the way they step into the lake in the kitchen and\nthey make tsk tsk and tut tut noises and they tell one another, Isn't this a disgrace? till they get upstairs to Italy. They tell Mam and Dad they're sorry to disturb them but the Society has to be sure they're helping deserving cases. Mam offers them a cup of tea but they look around and say, No, thank you. They want to know why we're living upstairs. They want to know about the lavatory. They ask questions because big people can ask all the questions they like and write in notebooks, especially when they're wearing collars and ties and suits. They ask how old Michael is, how much Dad gets at the Labour Exchange, when did he last have a job, why doesn't he have a job now and what class of an accent is that he has?\nDad tells them the lavatory could kill us with every class of disease, that the kitchen floods in the winter and we have to move upstairs to stay dry. He says the River Shannon is responsible for all the dampness in the world and killing us one by one.\nMalachy tells them we're living in Italy and they smile.\nMam asks if there's any chance of getting boots for Malachy and me and they say she'll have to come down to Ozanam House and apply. She says she hasn't been feeling well since the baby came and she wouldn't be able to stand long in a queue, but they say everyone has to be treated the same, even a woman down in the Irishtown that had triplets and, thank you, we'll make our report to the Society.\nWhen they're leaving Malachy wants to show them where the angel left Michael on the seventh step but Dad tells him, Not now, not now. Malachy cries and one of the men gives him a piece of toffee from his pocket and I wish I had something to cry about so that I'd get a piece, too.\nI have to go downstairs again and show the men where to step to keep their feet dry. They keep shaking their heads and saying, God Almighty and Mother of God, this is desperate. That's not Italy they have upstairs, that's Calcutta.\nDad is telling Mam up in Italy she should never beg like that. What do you mean, beg?\nDon't you have any pride, begging for boots like that?\nAnd what would you do, Mr. Grand Manner? Would you let them go\nbarefoot?\nI'd rather fix the shoes they have.\nThe shoes they have are falling to pieces.\nI can fix them, he says.\nYou can't fix anything. You're useless, she says.\nHe comes home the next day with an old bicycle tire. He sends me to\nMr. Hannon next door for the loan of a last and a hammer. He takes Mam's sharp knife and he hacks at the tire till he has pieces to fit on the soles and heels of our shoes. Mam tells him he's going to destroy the shoes altogether but he pounds away with the hammer, driving the nails through the rubber pieces and into the shoes. Mam says, God above, if you left the shoes alone they'd last till Easter, at least, and we might get the boots from the St. Vincent de Paul. But he won't stop till the soles and heels are covered with squares of rubber tire which stick out on each side of the shoe and flop before and behind. He makes us put on the shoes and tells us our feet will be good and warm but we don't want to wear them anymore because the tire pieces are so lumpy we stumble when we walk around Italy. He sends me back to Mr. Hannon with the last and hammer and Mrs. Hannon says, God above, what's up with your shoes? She laughs and Mr. Hannon shakes his head and I feel ashamed. I don't want to go to school next day and I pretend to be sick but Dad gets us up and gives us our fried bread and tea and tells us we should be grateful we have any shoes at all, that there are boys in Leamy's National School who go to school barefoot on bitter days. On our way to school Leamy's boys laugh at us because the tire pieces are so thick they add a few inches to our height and the boys say, How's the air up there? There are six or seven barefoot boys in my class and they don't say anything and I wonder if it's better to have shoes with rubber tires that make you trip and stumble or to go barefoot. If you have no shoes at all you'll have all the barefoot boys on your side. If you have rubber tires on your shoes\nyou're all alone with your brother and you have to fight your own battles. I sit on a bench in the schoolyard shed and take off my shoes and stockings but when I go into the class the master wants to know where my shoes are. He knows I'm not one of the barefoot boys and he makes me go back to the yard, bring in the shoes and put them on. Then he says to the class, There is sneering here. There is jeering at the misfortunes of others. Is there anyone in this class that thinks he's perfect? Raise your hands.\nThere are no hands. Is there anyone in this class that comes from a rich family with money galore to spend on shoes? Raise your hands.\nThere are no hands.\nHe says, There are boys here who have to mend their shoes whatever way they can. There are boys in this class with no shoes at all. It's not their fault and it's no shame. Our Lord had no shoes. He died shoeless. Do you see Him hanging on the cross sporting shoes? Do you, boys?\nNo, sir.\nWhat is it you don't see Our Lord doing?\nHanging on the cross and sporting shoes, sir.\nNow if I hear of one boy in this class jeering and sneering at\nMcCourt or his brother over their\nwill come out, boys?\nThe stick, sir.\nThe stick will sting, boys.\nair, it will land on the backside\nsneers. Where will it land, boys?\nshoes the stick will come out. What\nThe ash plant will whistle through the\nof the boy that jeers, the boy that\nOn the boy that jeers, sir.\nAnd?\nThe boy that sneers, sir.\nThe boys bother us no more and we wear our shoes with the rubber\ntires the few weeks to Easter when the St. Vincent de Paul Society gives us the gift of boots.\nIf I have to get up in the middle of the night to pee in the bucket I go to the top of the stairs and look down to see if the angel might be on the seventh step. Sometimes I'm sure there's a light there and if everyone's asleep I sit on the step in case the angel might be bringing another baby or just coming for a visit. I ask Mam if the angel just brings the babies and then forgets about them. She says, Of course not. The angel never forgets the babies and comes back to make sure the baby is happy.\nI could ask the angel all kinds of questions and I'm sure he'd answer, unless it's a girl angel. But I'm sure a girl angel would answer questions, too. I never heard anyone say they didn't.\nI sit on the seventh step a long time and I'm sure the angel is there. I tell him all the things you can't tell your mother or father for fear of being hit on the head or told go out and play. I tell him all about school and how I'm afraid of the master and his stick when he roars at us in Irish and I still don't know what he's talking about because I came from America and the other boys were learning Irish a year before me.\nI stay on the seventh step till it gets too cold or Dad gets up and tells me go back to bed. He's the one who told me the angel comes to the seventh step in the first place and you'd think he'd know why I'm sitting there. I told him one night that I was waiting for the angel, and he said, Och, now, Francis, you're a bit of a dreamer.\nI get back into bed but I can hear him whisper to my mother. The poor wee lad was sitting on the stairs talking away to an angel.\nHe laughs and my mother laughs and I think, Isn't it curious the way big people laugh over the angel who brought them a new child.\nBefore Easter we move back downstairs to Ireland. Easter is better than Christmas because the air is warmer, the walls are not dripping with the damp, and the kitchen isn't a lake anymore, and if we're up early we might catch the sun slanting for a minute through the kitchen window.\nIn fine weather men sit outside smoking their cigarettes if they have them, looking at the world and watching us play. Women stand with their arms folded, chatting. They don't sit because all they do is stay at home, take care of the children, clean the house and cook a bit and the men need the chairs. The men sit because they're worn out from walking to the Labour Exchange every morning to sign for the dole, discussing the world's problems and wondering what to do with the rest of the day. Some stop at the bookie to study the form and place a shilling or two on a sure thing. Some spend hours in the Carnegie Library reading English and Irish newspapers. A man on the dole needs to keep up with things because all the other men on the dole are experts on what's going on in the world. A man on the dole must be ready in case another man on the dole brings up Hitler or Mussolini or the terrible state of the Chinese millions. A man on the dole goes home after a day with the bookie or the newspaper and his wife will not begrudge him a few minutes with the ease and peace of his cigarette and his tea and time to sit in his chair and think of the world.\nEaster is better than Christmas because Dad takes us to the Redemptorist church where all the priests wear white and sing. They're happy because Our Lord is in heaven. I ask Dad if the baby in the crib is dead and he says, No, He was thirty-three when He died and there He is, hanging on the cross. I don't understand how He grew up so fast that He's hanging there with a hat made of thorns and blood everywhere, dripping from His head, His hands, His feet, and a big hole near His belly.\nDad says I'll understand when I grow up. He tells me that all the time now and I want to be big like him so that I can understand everything. It must be lovely to wake up in the morning and understand everything. I wish I could be like all the big people in the church, standing and kneeling and praying and understanding everything.\nAt the Mass people go up to the altar and the priest puts something into their mouths. They come back to their seats with their heads down, their mouths moving. Malachy says he's hungry and he wants some, too. Dad says, Shush, that's Holy Communion, the body and blood of Our Lord.\nBut, Dad.\nShush, it's a mystery.\nThere's no use asking more questions. If you ask a question they\ntell you it's a mystery, you'll understand when you grow up, be a good boy, ask your mother, ask your father, for the love o' Jesus leave me alone, go out and play.\nDad gets his first job in Limerick at the cement factory and Mam is happy. She won't have to stand in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society asking for clothes and boots for Malachy and me. She says it's not begging, it's charity, but Dad says it's begging and shameful. Mam says she can now pay off the few pounds she owes at Kathleen O'Connell's shop and she can pay back what she owes her own mother. She hates to be under obligation to anyone, especially her own mother.\nThe cement factory is miles outside Limerick and that means Dad has to be out of the house by six in the morning. He doesn't mind because he's used to the long walks. The night before Mam makes him a flask of tea, a sandwich, a hard-boiled egg. She feels sorry for him the way he has to walk three miles out and three miles back. A bicycle would be handy but you'd have to be working a year for the price of it.\nFriday is payday and Mam is out of the bed early, cleaning the house and singing.\nAnyone can see why I wanted your kiss, It had to be and the reason is this...\nThere isn't much to clean in the house. She sweeps the kitchen floor and the floor of Italy upstairs. She washes the four jam jars we use for mugs. She says if Dad's job lasts we'll get proper cups and maybe saucers and some day, with the help of God and His Blessed Mother, we'll have sheets on the bed and if we save a long time a blanket or two instead of those old coats which people must have left behind during the Great Famine. She boils water and washes the rags that keep Michael from shitting all over the pram and the house itself. Oh, she says, we'll have a lovely tea when your Pop brings home the wages tonight.\nPop. She's in a good mood.\nSirens and whistles go off all over the city when the men finish work at half-past five. Malachy and I are excited because we know that when your father works and brings home the wages you get the Friday Penny. We know this from other boys whose fathers work and we know that after your tea you can go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and buy sweets. If your mother is in a good mood she might even give you tuppence to go to the Lyric Cinema the next day to see a film with James Cagney.\nThe men who work in factories and shops in the city are coming into the lanes to have their supper, wash themselves and go to the pub. The women go to the films at the Coliseum or the Lyric Cinema. They buy sweets and Wild Woodbine cigarettes and if their husbands are working a long time they treat themselves to boxes of Black Magic chocolates. They love the romance films and they have a great time crying their eyes out when there's an unhappy ending or a handsome lover goes away to be shot by Hindus and other non-Catholics.\nWe have to wait a long time for Dad to walk the miles from the cement factory. We can't have our tea till he's home and that's very hard because you smell the cooking of other families in the lane. Mam says it's a good thing payday is Friday when you can't eat meat because the smell of bacon or sausages in other houses would drive her out of her mind. We can still have bread and cheese and a nice jam jar of tea with lashings of milk and sugar and what more do you want?\nThe women are gone to the cinemas, the men are in the pubs, and still Dad isn't home. Mam says it's a long way to the cement factory even if he's a fast walker. She says that but her eyes are watery and she's not singing anymore. She's sitting by the fire smoking a Wild Woodbine she got on credit from Kathleen O'Connell. The fag is the only luxury she has and she'll never forget Kathleen for her goodness. She doesn't know how long she can keep the water boiling in this kettle. There's no use making the tea till Dad gets home because it will be stewed, coddled, boiled and unfit to drink. Malachy says he's hungry and she gives him a piece of bread and cheese to keep him going. She says, This job could be\nthe saving of us. 'Tis hard enough for him to get a job with his northern accent and if he loses this one I don't know what we're going to do.\nThe darkness is in the lane and we have to light a candle. She has to give us our tea and bread and cheese because we're so hungry we can't wait another minute. She sits at the table, eats a bit of bread and cheese, smokes her Wild Woodbine. She goes to the door to see if Dad is coming down the lane and she talks about the paydays when we searched for him all over Brooklyn. She says, Some day we'll all go back to America and we'll have a nice warm place to live and a lavatory down the hall like the one in Classon Avenue and not this filthy thing outside our door.\nThe women are coming home from the cinemas, laughing, and the men, singing, from the pubs. Mam says there's no use waiting up any longer. If Dad stays in the pubs till closing time there will be nothing left from his wages and we might as well go to bed. She lies in her bed with Michael in her arms. It's quiet in the lane and I can hear her crying even though she pulls an old coat over her face and I can hear in the distance, my father.\nI know it's my father because he's the only one in Limerick who sings that song from the North, Roddy McCorley goes to die on the bridge of Toome today. He comes round the corner at the top of the lane and starts Kevin Barry. He sings a verse, stops, holds on to a wall, cries over Kevin Barry. People stick their heads out windows and doors and tell him, For Jasus' sake, put a sock in it. Some of us have to get up in the morning for work. Go home and sing your feckin' patriotic songs.\nHe stands in the middle of the lane and tells the world to step outside, he's ready to fight, ready to fight and die for Ireland, which is more than he can say for the men of Limerick, who are known the length and breadth of the world for collaborating with the perfidious Saxons.\nHe's pushing in our door and singing,\nAnd if, when all a vigil keep,\nThe West's asleep, the West's asleep! Alas! and well my Erin weep,\nThat Connacht lies in slumber deep,\nBut hark! a voice like thunder spake 'The West's awake! the West's awake! Sing, Oh, hurrah, let England quake, We'll watch till death for Erin's sake!'\nHe calls from the bottom of the stairs, Angela, Angela, is there a drop of tea in this house?\nShe doesn't answer and he calls again, Francis, Malachy, come down here, boys. I have the Friday Penny for you.\nI want to go down and get the Friday Penny but Mam is sobbing with the coat over her mouth and Malachy says, I don't want his old Friday Penny. He can keep it.\nDad is stumbling up the stairs, making a speech about how we all have to die for Ireland. He lights a match and touches it to the candle by Mam's bed. He holds the candle over his head and marches around the room, singing, See who comes over the red-blossomed heather, Their green banners kissing the pure mountain air, Heads erect, eyes to front,\nstepping proudly together, Sure freedom sits throned on each proud spirit there.\nMichael wakes and lets out a loud cry, the Hannons are banging on the wall next door, Mam is telling Dad he's a disgrace and why doesn't he get out of the house altogether.\nHe stands in the middle of the floor with the candle over his head. He pulls a penny from his pocket and waves it to Malachy and me. Your Friday Penny, boys, he says. I want you to jump out of that bed and line up here like two soldiers and promise to die for Ireland and I'll give the two of you the Friday Penny.\nMalachy sits up in the bed. I don't want it, he says.\nAnd I tell him I don't want it, either.\nDad stands for a minute, swaying, and puts the penny back in his\npocket. He turns toward Mam and she says, You're not sleeping in this bed tonight. He makes his way downstairs with the candle, sleeps on a chair, misses work in the morning, loses the job at the cement factory, and we're back on the dole again.\nIV\nThe master says it's time to prepare for First Confession and First Communion, to know and remember all the questions and answers in the catechism, to become good Catholics, to know the difference between right and wrong, to die for the Faith if called on.\nThe master says it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith and Dad says it's a glorious thing to die for Ireland and I wonder if there's anyone in the world who would like us to live. My brothers are dead and my sister is dead and I wonder if they died for Ireland or the Faith. Dad says they were too young to die for anything. Mam says it was disease and starvation and him never having a job. Dad says, Och, Angela, puts on his cap and goes for a long walk.\nThe master says we're each to bring threepence for the First Communion catechism with the green cover. The catechism has all the questions and answers we have to know by heart before we can receive First Communion. Older boys in the fifth class have the thick Confirmation catechism with the red cover and that costs sixpence. I'd love to be big and important and parade around with the red Confirmation catechism but I don't think I'll live that long the way I'm expected to die for this or that. I want to ask why there are so many big people who haven't died for Ireland or the Faith but I know if you ask a question like that you get you the thump on the head or you're told go out and play.\nIt's very handy to have Mikey Molloy living around the corner from me. He's eleven, he has fits and behind his back we call him Molloy the Fit. People in the lane say the fit is an affliction and now I know what affliction means. Mikey knows everything because he has visions in his fits and he reads books. He's the expert in the lane on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General and he promises, I'll tell you everything, Frankie, when you're eleven like me and you're not so thick and ignorant.\nIt's a good thing he says Frankie so I'll know he's talking to me because he has crossed eyes and you never know who he's looking at. If he's talking to Malachy and I think he's talking to me he might go into a\nrage and have a fit that will carry him off. He says it's a gift to have crossed eyes because you're like a god looking two ways at once and if you had crossed eyes in the ancient Roman times you had no problem getting a good job. If you look at pictures of Roman emperors you'll see there's always a great hint of crossed eyes. When he's not having the fit he sits on the ground at the top of the lane reading the books his father brings home from the Carnegie Library. His mother says books books books, he's ruining his eyes with the reading, he needs an operation to straighten them but who'll pay for it. She tells him if he keeps on straining his eyes they'll float together till he has one eye in the middle of his head. Ever after his father calls him Cyclops, who is in a Greek story.\nNora Molloy knows my mother from the queues at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. She tells Mam that Mikey has more sense than twelve men drinking pints in a pub. He knows the names of all the Popes from St. Peter to Pius the Eleventh. He's only eleven but he's a man, oh, a man indeed. Many a week he saves the family from pure starvation. He borrows a handcart from Aidan Farrell and knocks on doors all over Limerick to see if there are people who want coal or turf delivered, and down the Dock Road he'll go to haul back great bags a hundredweight or more. He'll run messages for old people who can't walk and if they don't have a penny to give him a prayer will do.\nIf he earns a little money he hands it over to his mother, who loves her Mikey. He is her world, her heart's blood, her pulse, and if anything ever happened to him they might as well stick her in the lunatic asylum and throw away the key.\nMikey's father, Peter, is a great champion. He wins bets in the pubs by drinking more pints than anyone. All he has to do is go out to the jakes, stick his finger down his throat and bring it all up so that he can start another round. Peter is such a champion he can stand in the jakes and throw up without using his finger. He's such a champion they could chop off his fingers and he'd carry on regardless. He wins all that money but doesn't bring it home. Sometimes he's like my father and drinks the dole itself and that's why Nora Molloy is often carted off to the lunatic asylum demented with worry over her hungry famishing family. She knows as long as you're in the asylum you're safe from the world and its torments, there's nothing you can do, you're protected, and what's the use of worrying. It's well known that all the lunatics in the asylum have to be dragged in but she's the only one that has to be dragged out, back to her five children and the champion of all pint drinkers.\nYou can tell when Nora Molloy is ready for the asylum when you see her children running around white with flour from poll to toe. That happens when Peter drinks the dole money and leaves her desperate and she knows the men will come to take her away. You know she's inside frantic with the baking. She wants to make sure the children won't starve while she's gone and she roams Limerick begging for flour. She goes to priests, nuns, Protestants, Quakers. She goes to Rank's Flour Mills and begs for the sweepings from the floor. She bakes day and night. Peter begs her to stop but she screams, This is what comes of drinking the dole. He tells her the bread will only go stale. There's no use talking to her. Bake bake bake. If she had the money she'd bake all the flour in Limerick and regions beyond. If the men didn't come from the lunatic asylum to take her away she'd bake till she fell to the floor.\nThe children stuff themselves with so much bread people in the lane say they're looking like loaves. Still the bread goes stale and Mikey is so bothered by the waste he talks to a rich woman with a cookbook and she tells him make bread pudding. He boils the hard bread in water and sour milk and throws in a cup of sugar and his brother loves it even if that's all they have the fortnight their mother is in the lunatic asylum.\nMy father says, Do they take her away because she's gone mad baking bread or does she go mad baking bread because they're taking her away?\nNora comes home calm as if she had been at the seaside. She always says, Where's Mikey? Is he alive? She worries over Mikey because he's not a proper Catholic and if he had a fit and died who knows where he might wind up in the next life. He's not a proper Catholic because he could never receive his First Communion for fear of getting anything on his tongue that might cause a fit and choke him. The master tried over and over with bits of the Limerick Leader but Mikey kept spitting them out till the master got into a state and sent him to the priest, who wrote to the bishop, who said, Don't bother me, handle it yourself. The master sent a note home saying Mikey was to practice receiving Communion with his father or mother but even they couldn't get him to swallow a piece of the Limerick Leader in the shape of a wafer. They even tried a piece of bread shaped like the wafer with bread and jam and it was no use. The priest tells Mrs. Molloy not to worry. God moves in mysterious ways His wonders to perform and surely He has a special purpose for Mikey, fits and all. She says, Isn't it remarkable he can swally all kinds of sweets and buns but if he has to swally the body of Our Lord he goes into a fit? Isn't that remarkable? She worries Mikey might have the fit and die and go to hell if he has any class of a sin on his soul though everyone knows he's an angel out of heaven. Mikey tells her God is not going to afflict you with the fit and then boot you into hell on top of it. What kind of a God would do a thing like that?\nAre you sure, Mikey?\nI am. I read it in a book.\nHe sits under the lamppost at the top of the lane and laughs over\nhis First Communion day, which was all a cod. He couldn't swallow the wafer but did that stop his mother from parading him around Limerick in his little black suit for The Collection? She said to Mikey, Well, I'm not lying so I'm not. I'm only saying to the neighbors, Here's Mikey in his First Communion suit. That's all I'm saying, mind you. Here's Mikey. If they think you swallied your First Communion who am I to contradict them and disappoint them? Mikey's father said, Don't worry, Cyclops. You have loads of time. Jesus didn't become a proper Catholic till he took the bread and wine at the Last Supper and He was thirty-three years of age. Nora Molloy said, Will you stop calling him Cyclops? He has two eyes in his head and he's not a Greek. But Mikey's father, champion of all pint drinkers, is like my uncle Pa Keating, he doesn't give a fiddler's fart what the world says and that's the way I'd like to be myself.\nMikey tells me the best thing about First Communion is The Collection. Your mother has to get you a new suit somehow so she can show you off to the neighbors and relations and they give you sweets and money and you can go to the Lyric Cinema to see Charlie Chaplin.\nWhat about James Cagney?\nNever mind James Cagney. Lots of blather. Charlie Chaplin is your only man. But you have to be with your mother on The Collection. The grown-up people of Limerick are not going to be handing out money to\nevery little Tom Dick and Mick with a First Communion suit that doesn't have his mother with him.\nMikey got over five shillings on his First Communion day and ate so many sweets and buns he threw up in the Lyric Cinema and Frank Goggin, the ticket man, kicked him out. He says he didn't care because he had money left over and went to the Savoy Cinema the same day for a pirate film and ate Cadbury chocolate and drank lemonade till his stomach stuck out a mile. He can't wait for Confirmation day because you're older, there's another collection and that brings more money than First Communion. He'll go to the cinema the rest of his life, sit next to girls from lanes and do dirty things like an expert. He loves his mother but he'll never get married for fear he might have a wife in and out of the lunatic asylum. What's the use of getting married when you can sit in cinemas and do dirty things with girls from lanes who don't care what they do because they already did it with their brothers. If you don't get married you won't have any children at home bawling for tea and bread and gasping with the fit and looking in every direction with their eyes. When he's older he'll go to the pub like his father, drink pints galore, stick the finger down the throat to bring it all up, drink more pints, win the bets and bring the money home to his mother to keep her from going demented.\nHe says he's not a proper Catholic which means he's doomed so he can do anything he bloody well likes. He says, I'll tell you more when you grow up, Frankie. You're too young now and you don't know your arse from your elbow.\nThe master, Mr. Benson, is very old. He roars and spits all over us every day. The boys in the front row hope he has no diseases for it's the spit that carries all the diseases and he might be spreading consumption right and left. He tells us we have to know the catechism backwards, forwards and sideways. We have to know the Ten Commandments, the Seven Virtues, Divine and Moral, the Seven Sacraments, the Seven Deadly Sins. We have to know by heart all the prayers, the Hail Mary, the Our Father, the Confiteor, the Apostles' Creed, the Act of Contrition, the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary. We have to know them in Irish and English and if we forget an Irish word and use English he goes into a rage and goes at us with the stick. If he had his way we'd be learning our religion in Latin, the language of the saints who communed intimately with God and His Holy Mother, the language of the early Christians, who huddled in the catacombs and went forth to die on rack and sword, who expired in the foaming jaws of the ravenous lion. Irish is fine for patriots, English for traitors and informers, but it's the Latin that gains us entrance to heaven itself. It's the Latin the martyrs prayed in when the barbarians pulled out their nails and cut their skin off inch by inch. He tells us we're a disgrace to Ireland and her long sad history, that we'd be better off in Africa praying to bush or tree. He tells us we're hopeless, the worst class he ever had for First Communion but as sure as God made little apples he'll make Catholics of us, he'll beat the idler out of us and the Sanctifying Grace into us.\nBrendan Quigley raises his hand. We call him Question Quigley because he's always asking questions. He can't help himself. Sir, he says, what's Sanctifying Grace?\nThe master rolls his eyes to heaven. He's going to kill Quigley. Instead he barks at him, Never mind what's Sanctifying Grace, Quigley. That's none of your business. You're here to learn the catechism and do\nwhat you're told. You're not here to be asking questions. There are too many people wandering the world asking questions and that's what has us in the state we're in and if I find any boy in this class asking questions I won't be responsible for what happens. Do you hear me, Quigley?\nI do.\nI do what?\nI do, sir.\nHe goes on with his speech, There are boys in this class who will\nnever know the Sanctifying Grace. And why? Because of the greed. I have heard them abroad in the schoolyard talking about First Communion day, the happiest day of your life. Are they talking about receiving the body and blood of Our Lord? Oh, no. Those greedy little blaguards are talking about the money they'll get, The Collection. They'll go from house to house in their little suits like beggars for The Collection. And will they take any of that money and send it to the little black babies in Africa? Will they think of those little pagans doomed forever for lack of baptism and knowledge of the True Faith? Little black babies denied knowledge of the Mystical Body of Christ? Limbo is packed with little black babies flying around and crying for their mothers because they'll never be admitted to the ineffable presence of Our Lord and the glorious company of saints, martyrs, virgins. Oh, no. It's off to the cinemas, our First Communion boys run to wallow in the filth spewed across the world by the devil's henchmen in Hollywood. Isn't that right, McCourt?\n'Tis, sir.\nQuestion Quigley raises his hand again. There are looks around the room and we wonder if it's suicide he's after.\nWhat's henchmen, sir?\nThe master's face goes white, then red. His mouth tightens and opens and spit flies everywhere. He walks to Question and drags him from his seat. He snorts and stutters and his spit flies around the room. He flogs Question across the shoulders, the bottom, the legs. He grabs him by the collar and drags him to the front of the room.\nLook at this specimen, he roars.\nQuestion is shaking and crying. I'm sorry, sir.\nThe master mocks him. I'm sorry, sir. What are you sorry for? I'm sorry I asked the question. I'll never ask a question again,\nsir.\nThe day you do, Quigley, will be the day you wish God would take\nyou to His bosom. What will you wish, Quigley?\nThat God will take me to His bosom, sir.\nGo back to your seat, you omadhaun, you poltroon, you thing from\nthe far dark corner of a bog.\nHe sits down with the stick before him on the desk. He tells\nQuestion to stop the whimpering and be a man. If he hears a single boy in this class asking foolish questions or talking about The Collection again he'll flog that boy till the blood spurts.\nwhat?\nWhat will I do, boys?\nFlog the boy, sir.\nTill?\nTill the blood spurts, sir.\nNow, Clohessy, what is the Sixth Commandment?\nThou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not commit adultery\nThou shalt not commit adultery, sir.\nAnd what is adultery, Clohessy?\nImpure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, sir.\nGood, Clohessy. You're a good boy. You may be slow and forgetful in\nthe sir department and you may not have a shoe to your foot but you're powerful with the Sixth Commandment and that will keep you pure.\nPaddy Clohessy has no shoe to his foot, his mother shaves his head to keep the lice away, his eyes are red, his nose always snotty. The sores on his kneecaps never heal because he picks at the scabs and puts them in his mouth. His clothes are rags he has to share with his six brothers and a sister and when he comes to school with a bloody nose or a black eye you know he had a fight over the clothes that morning. He hates school. He's seven going on eight, the biggest and oldest boy in the class, and he can't wait to grow up and be fourteen so that he can run away and pass for seventeen and join the English army and go to India where it's nice and warm and he'll live in a tent with a dark girl with the red dot on her forehead and he'll be lying there eating figs, that's what they eat in India, figs, and she'll cook the curry day and night and plonk on a ukulele and when he has enough money he'll send for the whole family and they'll all live in the tent especially his poor father who's at home coughing up great gobs of blood because of the consumption. When my mother sees Paddy on the street she says, Wisha, look at that poor child. He's a skeleton with rags and if they were making a film about the famine he'd surely be put in the middle of it.\nI think Paddy likes me because of the raisin and I feel a bit guilty because I wasn't that generous in the first place. The master, Mr. Benson, said the government was going to give us the free lunch so we wouldn't have to be going home in the freezing weather. He led us down to a cold room in the dungeons of Leamy's School where the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, was handing out the half pint of milk and the raisin bun. The milk was frozen in the bottles and we had to melt it between our thighs. The boys joked and said the bottles would freeze our things off and the master roared, Any more of that talk and I'll warm the bottles on the backs of yeer heads. We all searched our raisin buns for a raisin but Nellie said they must have forgotten to put them in and she'd inquire from the man who delivered. We searched again every day till at last I found a raisin in my bun and held it up. The boys started grousing and said they wanted a raisin and Nellie said it wasn't her fault. She'd ask the man again. Now the boys were begging me for the raisin and offering me everything, a slug of their milk, a pencil, a comic book. Toby Mackey said I could have his sister and Mr. Benson heard him and took him out to the hallway and knocked him around till he howled. I wanted the raisin for myself but I saw Paddy Clohessy standing in the corner with no shoes and the room was freezing and he was shivering like a dog that had been kicked and I always felt sad over kicked dogs so I walked over and gave Paddy the raisin because I didn't know what else to do and all the boys yelled that I was a fool and a feckin' eejit and I'd regret the day and after I handed the raisin to Paddy I longed for it but it was too late now because he pushed it right into his mouth and gulped it and looked at me and said nothing and I said in my head what kind of an eejit are you to be giving away your raisin.\nMr. Benson gave me a look and said nothing and Nellie Ahearn said, You're a great oul'Yankee, Frankie.\nThe priest will come soon to examine us on the catechism and everything else. The master himself has to show us how to receive Holy\nCommunion. He tells us gather round him. He fills his hat with the Limerick Leader torn into little bits. He gives Paddy Clohessy the hat, kneels on the floor, tells Paddy to take one bit of paper and place it on his tongue. He shows us how to stick out the tongue, receive the bit of paper, hold it a moment, draw in the tongue, fold your hands in prayer, look toward heaven, close your eyes in adoration, wait for the paper to melt in your mouth, swallow it, and thank God for the gift, the Sanctifying Grace wafting in on the odor of sanctity. When he sticks out his tongue we have to hold in the laugh because we never saw a big purple tongue before. He opens his eyes to catch the boys who are giggling but he can't say anything because he still has God on his tongue and it's a holy moment. He gets off his knees and tells us kneel around the classroom for the Holy Communion practice. He goes around the room placing bits of paper on our tongues and mumbling in Latin. Some boys giggle and he roars at them that if the giggling doesn't stop it's not Holy Communion they'll be getting but the Last Rites and what is that sacrament called, McCourt?\nExtreme Unction, sir.\nThat's right, McCourt. Not bad for a Yank from the sinful shores of Amerikay.\nHe tells us we have to be careful to stick out our tongues far enough so that the Communion wafer won't fall to the floor. He says, That's the worst thing that can happen to a priest. If the wafer slides off your tongue that poor priest has to get down on his two knees, pick it up with his own tongue and lick the floor around it in case it bounced from one spot to another. The priest could get a splinter that would make his tongue swell to the size of a turnip and that's enough to choke you and kill you entirely.\nHe tells us that next to a relic of the True Cross the Communion wafer is the holiest thing in the world and our First Communion is the holiest moment in our lives. Talking about First Communion makes the master all excited. He paces back and forth, waves his stick, tells us we must never forget that the moment the Holy Communion is placed on our tongues we become members of that most glorious congregation, the One, Holy, Roman, Catholic and Apostolic Church, that for two thousand years men, women and children have died for the Faith, that the Irish have nothing to be ashamed of in the martyr department. Haven't we provided martyrs galore? Haven't we bared our necks to the Protestant ax? Haven't we mounted the scaffold, singing, as if embarking on a picnic, haven't we, boys?\nWe have, sir.\nWhat have we done, boys?\nBared our necks to the Protestant ax, sir.\nAnd?\nMounted the scaffold singing, sir.\nAs if?\nEmbarking on a picnic, sir.\nHe says that, perhaps, in this class there is a future priest or a\nmartyr for the Faith, though he doubts it very much for we are the laziest gang of ignoramuses it has ever been his misfortune to teach.\nBut it takes all kinds, he says, and surely God had some purpose when He sent the likes of ye to infest this earth. Surely God had a purpose when among us He sent Clohessy with no shoes, Quigley with his damnable questions and McCourt heavy with sin from America. And remember\nthis, boys, God did not send His only begotten Son to hang on the cross so that ye can go around on yeer First Communion day with the paws clutching for The Collection. Our Lord died so that ye might be redeemed. It is enough to receive the gift of Faith. Are ye listening to me?\nWe are, sir.\nAnd what's enough?\nThe gift of Faith, sir.\nGood. Go home.\nAt night three of us sit under the light pole at the top of the\nlane reading, Mikey, Malachy and I. The Molloys are like us with their father drinking the dole money or the wages and leaving no money for candles or paraffin oil for the lamp. Mikey reads books and the rest of us read comic books. His father, Peter, brings books from the Carnegie Library so that he'll have something to do when he's not drinking pints or when he's looking after the family anytime Mrs. Molloy is in the lunatic asylum. He lets Mikey read any book he likes and now Mikey is reading this book about Cuchulain and talking as if he knows everything about him. I want to tell him I knew all about Cuchulain when I was three going on four, that I saw Cuchulain in Dublin, that Cuchulain thinks nothing of dropping into my dreams. I want to tell him stop talking about Cuchulain, he's mine, he was mine years ago when I was young, but I can't because Mikey reads us a story I never heard of before, a dirty story about Cuchulain which I can never tell my father or mother, the story of how Emer became Cuchulain's wife.\nCuchulain was getting to be an old man of twenty-one. He was lonely and wanted to get married, which made him weak, says Mikey, and got him killed in the end. All the women in Ireland were mad about Cuchulain and they wanted to marry him. He said that would be grand, he wouldn't mind marrying all the women of Ireland. If he could fight all the men of Ireland why couldn't he marry all the women? But the King, Conor MacNessa, said, That's all very well for you, Cu, but the men of Ireland don't want to be lonely in the far reaches of the night. The King decided there would have to be a contest to see who would marry Cuchulain and it would be a pissing contest. All the women of Ireland assembled on the plains of Muirthemne to see who could piss the longest and it was Emer. She was the champion woman pisser of Ireland and married Cuchulain and that's why to this day she is called Great Bladdered Emer.\nMikey and Malachy laugh over this story though I don't think Malachy understands it. He's young and far from his First Communion and he's only laughing over the piss word. Then Mikey tells me I've committed a sin by listening to a story that has that word in it and when I go to my First Confession I'll have to tell the priest. Malachy says, That's right. Piss is a bad word and you have to tell the priest because 'tis a sin word.\nI don't know what to do. How can I go to the priest and tell him this terrible thing in my First Confession? All the boys know what sins they're going to tell so that they'll get the First Communion and make The Collection and go to see James Cagney and eat sweets and cakes at the Lyric Cinema. The master helped us with our sins and everyone has the same sins. I hit my brother. I told a lie. I stole a penny from my mother's purse. I disobeyed my parents, I ate a sausage on Friday.\nBut now I have a sin no one else has and the priest is going to be shocked and drag me out of the confession box into the aisle and out into the street where everyone will know I listened to a story about\nCuchulain's wife being the champion woman pisser in all Ireland. I'll never be able to make my First Communion and mothers will hold their small children up and point at me and say, Look at him. He's like Mikey Molloy, never made his First Communion, wandering around in a state of sin, never made The Collection, never saw James Cagney.\nI'm sorry I ever heard of First Communion and The Collection. I'm sick and I don't want any tea or bread or anything. Mam tells Dad it's a strange thing when a child won't have his bread and tea and Dad says, Och, he's just nervous over the First Communion. I want to go over to him and sit on his lap and tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me but I'm too big to be sitting on laps and if I did Malachy would go out in the lane and tell everyone I was a big baby. I'd like to tell my troubles to the Angel on the Seventh Step but he's busy bringing babies to mothers all over the world. Still, I'll ask Dad.\nDad, does the Angel on the Seventh Step have other jobs besides bringing babies?\nHe does.\nWould the Angel on the Seventh Step tell you what to do if you didn't know what to do?\nOch, he would, son, he would. That's the job of an angel, even the one on the seventh step.\nDad goes for a long walk, Mam takes Michael and goes to see Grandma, Malachy plays in the lane, and I have the house to myself so that I can sit on the seventh step and talk to the angel. I know he's there because the seventh step feels warmer than the other steps and there's a light in my head. I tell him my troubles and I hear a voice. Fear not, says the voice.\nHe's talking backward and I tell him I don't know what he's talking about.\nDo not fear, says the voice. Tell the priest your sin and you'll be forgiven.\nNext morning I'm up early and drinking tea with Dad and telling him about the Angel on the Seventh Step. He places his hand on my forehead to see if I'm feeling all right. He asks if I'm sure I had a light in my head and heard a voice and what did the voice say?\nI tell him the voice said Fear not and that means Do not fear.\nDad tells me the angel is right, I shouldn't be afraid, and I tell him what Mikey Molloy did to me. I tell him all about Great Bladdered Emer and I even use the piss word because the angel said, Fear not. Dad puts down his jam jar of tea and pats the back of my hand. Och, och, och, he says, and I wonder if he's going demented like Mrs. Molloy, in and out of the lunatic asylum, but he says, Is that what you were worried about last night?\nI tell him it is and he says it's not a sin and I don't have to tell the priest.\nBut the Angel on the Seventh Step said I should.\nAll right. Tell the priest if you like but the Angel on the Seventh Step said that only because you didn't tell me first. Isn't it better to be able to tell your father your troubles rather than an angel who is a light and a voice in your head?\n'Tis, Dad.\nThe day before First Communion the master leads us to St. Joseph's Church for First Confession. We march in pairs and if we so much as move a lip on the streets of Limerick he'll kill us on the spot and send us to\nhell bloated with sin. That doesn't stop the bragging about the big sins. Willie Harold is whispering about his big sin, that he looked at his sister's naked body. Paddy Hartigan says he stole ten shillings from his aunt's purse and made himself sick with ice cream and chips. Question Quigley says he ran away from home and spent half the night in a ditch with four goats. I try to tell them about Cuchulain and Emer but the master catches me talking and gives me a thump on the head.\nWe kneel in the pews by the confession box and I wonder if my Emer sin is as bad as looking at your sister's naked body because I know now that some things in the world are worse than others. That's why they have different sins, the sacrilege, the mortal sin, the venial sin. Then the masters and grown-up people in general talk about the unforgivable sin, which is a great mystery. No one knows what it is and you wonder how you can know if you've committed it if you don't know what it is. If I tell a priest about Great Bladdered Emer and the pissing contest he might say that's the unforgivable sin and kick me out of the confession box and I'll be disgraced all over Limerick and doomed to hell tormented forever by devils who have nothing else to do but stab me with hot pitchforks till I'm worn out.\nI try to listen to Willie's confession when he goes in but all I can hear is a hissing from the priest and when Willie comes out he's crying.\nIt's my turn. The confession box is dark and there's a big crucifix hanging over my head. I can hear a boy mumbling his confession on the other side. I wonder if there's any use trying to talk to the Angel on the Seventh Step. I know he's not supposed to be hanging around confession boxes but I feel the light in my head and the voice is telling me, Fear not.\nThe panel slides back before my face and the priest says, Yes, my child?\nBless me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my First Confession. Yes, my child, and what sins have you committed?\nI told a lie. I hit my brother. I took a penny from my mother's\npurse. I said a curse.\nYes, my child. Anything else?\nI, I listened to a story about Cuchulain and Emer.\nSurely that's not a sin, my child. After all we are assured by\ncertain writers that Cuchulain turned Catholic in his last moments as did his King, Conor MacNessa.\n'Tis about Emer, Father, and how she married him.\nHow was that, my child?\nShe won him in a pissing contest.\nThere is heavy breathing. The priest has his hand over his mouth\nand he's making choking sounds and talking to himself, Mother o' God. Who, who told you that story, my child?\nMikey Molloy, Father.\nAnd where did he hear it?\nHe read it in a book, Father.\nAh, a book. Books can be dangerous for children, my child. Turn your mind from those silly stories and think of the lives of the saints. Think of St. Joseph, the Little Flower, the sweet and gentle St. Francis of Assisi, who loved the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. Will you do that, my child?\nI will, Father.\nAre there any other sins, my child?\nNo, Father.\nFor your penance say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, and say a\nspecial prayer for me.\nI will. Father, was that the worst sin?\nWhat do you mean?\nAm I the worst of all the boys, Father?\nNo, my child, you have a long way to go. Now say an Act of\nContrition and remember Our Lord watches you every minute. God bless you, my child.\nFirst Communion day is the happiest day of your life because of The Collection and James Cagney at the Lyric Cinema. The night before I was so excited I couldn't sleep till dawn. I'd still be sleeping if my grandmother hadn't come banging at the door.\nGet up! Get up! Get that child outa the bed. Happiest day of his life an' him snorin' above in the bed.\nI ran to the kitchen. Take off that shirt, she said. I took off the shirt and she pushed me into a tin tub of icy cold water. My mother scrubbed me, my grandmother scrubbed me. I was raw, I was red.\nThey dried me. They dressed me in my black velvet First Communion suit with the white frilly shirt, the short pants, the white stockings, the black patent leather shoes. Around my arm they tied a white satin bow and on my lapel they pinned the Sacred Heart of Jesus, a picture of the Sacred Heart, with blood dripping from it, flames erupting all around it and on top a nasty looking crown of thorns.\nCome here till I comb your hair, said Grandma. Look at that mop, it won't lie down. You didn't get that hair from my side of the family. That's that North of Ireland hair you got from your father. That's the kind of hair you see on Presbyterians. If your mother had married a proper decent Limerickman you wouldn't have this standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair.\nShe spat twice on my head.\nGrandma, will you please stop spitting on my head. If you have anything to say, shut up. A little spit won't kill you. Come on, we'll be late for the Mass.\nWe ran to the church. My mother panted along behind with Michael in her arms. We arrived at the church just in time to see the last of the boys leaving the altar rail where the priest stood with the chalice and the host, glaring at me. Then he placed on my tongue the wafer, the body and blood of Jesus. At last, at last.\nIt's on my tongue. I draw it back.\nIt stuck.\nI had God glued to the roof of my mouth. I could hear the master's\nvoice, Don't let that host touch your teeth for if you bite God in two you'll roast in hell for eternity.\nI tried to get God down with my tongue but the priest hissed at me, Stop that clucking and get back to your seat.\nGod was good. He melted and I swallowed Him and now, at last, I was a member of the True Church, an official sinner.\nWhen the Mass ended there they were at the door of the church, my mother with Michael in her arms, my grandmother. They each hugged me to their bosoms. They each told me it was the happiest day of my life. They each cried all over my head and after my grandmother's contribution that morning my head was a swamp.\nMam, can I go now and make The Collection?\nShe said, After you have a little breakfast.\nNo, said Grandma. You're not making no collection till you've had a\nproper First Communion breakfast at my house. Come on.\nWe followed her. She banged pots and rattled pans and complained\nthat the whole world expected her to be at their beck and call. I ate the egg, I ate the sausage, and when I reached for more sugar for my tea she slapped my hand away.\nGo aisy with that sugar. Is it a millionaire you think I am? An American? Is it bedecked in glitterin' jewelry you think I am? Smothered in fancy furs?\nThe food churned in my stomach. I gagged. I ran to her backyard and threw it all up. Out she came.\nLook at what he did. Thrun up his First Communion breakfast. Thrun up the body and blood of Jesus. I have God in me backyard. What am I goin' to do? I'll take him to the Jesuits for they know the sins of the Pope himself.\nShe dragged me through the streets of Limerick. She told the neighbors and passing strangers about God in her backyard. She pushed me into the confession box.\nIn the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's a day since my last confession.\nA day? And what sins have you committed in a day, my child?\nI overslept. I nearly missed my First Communion. My grandmother said I have standing up, North of Ireland, Presbyterian hair. I threw up my First Communion breakfast. Now Grandma says she has God in her backyard and what should she do.\nThe priest is like the First Confession priest. He has the heavy breathing and the choking sounds.\nAh... ah... tell your grandmother to wash God away with a little water and for your penance say one Hail Mary and one Our Father. Say a prayer for me and God bless you, my child.\nGrandma and Mam were waiting close to the confession box. Grandma said, Were you telling jokes to that priest in the confession box? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you were telling jokes to Jesuits I'll tear the bloody kidneys outa you. Now what did he say about God in me backyard?\nHe said wash Him away with a little water, Grandma. Holy water or ordinary water?\nHe didn't say, Grandma.\nWell, go back and ask him.\nBut, Grandma...\nShe pushed me back into the confessional.\nBless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a minute since my last\nconfession.\nA minute! Are you the boy that was just here?\nI am, Father.\nWhat is it now?\nMy grandma says, Holy water or ordinary water? Ordinary water, and\ntell your grandmother not to be bothering me again.\nI told her, Ordinary water, Grandma, and he said don't be bothering\nhim again.\nDon't be bothering him again. That bloody ignorant bogtrotter.\nI asked Mam, Can I go now and make The Collection? I want to see James Cagney.\nGrandma said, You can forget about The Collection and James Cagney because you're not a proper Catholic the way you left God on the ground. Come on, go home.\nMam said, Wait a minute. That's my son. That's my son on his First Communion day. He's going to see James Cagney.\nNo he's not.\nYes he is.\nGrandma said, Take him then to James Cagney and see if that will\nsave his Presbyterian North of Ireland American soul. Go ahead.\nShe pulled her shawl around her and walked away.\nMam said, God, it's getting very late for The Collection and you'll\nnever see James Cagney. We'll go to the Lyric Cinema and see if they'll let you in anyway in your First Communion suit.\nWe met Mikey Molloy on Barrington Street. He asked if I was going to the Lyric and I said I was trying. Trying? he said. You don't have money?\nI was ashamed to say no but I had to and he said, That's all right. I'll get you in. I'll create a diversion.\nWhat's a diversion?\nI have the money to go and when I get in I'll pretend to have the fit and the ticket man will be out of his mind and you can slip in when I let out the big scream. I'll be watching the door and when I see you in I'll have a miraculous recovery. That's a diversion. That's what I do to get my brothers in all the time.\nMam said, Oh, I don't know about that, Mikey. Wouldn't that be a sin and surely you wouldn't want Frank to commit a sin on his First Communion day.\nMikey said if there was a sin it would be on his soul and he wasn't a proper Catholic anyway so it didn't matter. He let out his scream and I slipped in and sat next to Question Quigley and the ticket man, Frank Goggin, was so worried over Mikey he never noticed. It was a thrilling film but sad in the end because James Cagney was a public enemy and when they shot him they wrapped him in bandages and threw him in the door, shocking his poor old Irish mother, and that was the end of my First Communion day.\nV\nGrandma won't talk to Mam anymore because of what I did with God in her backyard. Mam doesn't talk to her sister, Aunt Aggie, or her brother Uncle Tom. Dad doesn't talk to anyone in Mam's family and they don't talk to him because he's from the North and he has the odd manner. No one talks to Uncle Tom's wife, Jane, because she's from Galway and she has the look of a Spaniard. Everyone talks to Mam's brother Uncle Pat, because he was dropped on his head, he's simple, and he sells newspapers. Everyone calls him The Abbot or Ab Sheehan and no one knows why. Everyone talks to Uncle Pa Keating because he was gassed in the war and married Aunt Aggie and if they didn't talk to him he wouldn't give a fiddler's fart anyway and that's why the men in South's pub call him a gas man.\nThat's the way I'd like to be in the world, a gas man, not giving a fiddler's fart, and that's what I tell the Angel on the Seventh Step till I remember you're not supposed to say fart in the presence of an angel.\nUncle Tom and Galway Jane have children but we're not supposed to talk to them because our parents are not talking. They have a son and daughter, Gerry and Peggy, and Mam will yell at us for talking to them but we don't know how not to talk to our cousins.\nPeople in families in the lanes of Limerick have their ways of not talking to each other and it takes years of practice. There are people who don't talk to each other because their fathers were on opposite sides in the Civil War in 1922. If a man goes off and joins the English army his family might as well move to another part of Limerick where there are families with men in the English army. If anyone in your family was the least way friendly to the English in the last eight hundred years it will be brought up and thrown in your face and you might as well move to Dublin where no one cares. There are families that are ashamed of themselves because their forefathers gave up their religion for the sake of a bowl of Protestant soup during the Famine and those families are known ever after as soupers. It's a terrible thing to be a souper because you're doomed forever to the souper part of hell. It's even worse to be an informer. The master at school said that everytime the Irish were about to demolish the English in a fair fight a filthy informer betrayed them. A man who's discovered to be an informer deserves to be hanged or, even worse, to have no one talk to him for if no one talks to you you're better off hanging at the end of a rope.\nIn every lane there's always someone not talking to someone or everyone not talking to someone or someone not talking to everyone. You can always tell when people are not talking by the way they pass each other. The women hoist their noses, tighten their mouths and turn their faces away. If the woman is wearing a shawl she takes a corner and flings it over her shoulder as if to say, One word or look from you, you ma faced bitch, and I'll tear the countenance from the front of your head.\nIt's bad when Grandma won't talk to us because we can't run to her when we need to borrow sugar or tea or milk. There's no use going to Aunt Aggie. She'll only bite your head off. Go home, she'll say, and tell your father to get off his northern arse and get a job like the decent men of Limerick.\nThey say she's always angry because she has red hair or she has red hair because she's always angry.\nMam is friendly with Bridey Hannon, who lives next door with her mother and father. Mam and Bridey talk all the time. When my father goes for his long walk Bridey comes in and she and Mam sit by the fire drinking tea and smoking cigarettes. If Mam has nothing in the house Bridey brings tea, sugar and milk. Sometimes they use the same tea leaves over and over and Mam says the tea is stewed, coddled and boiled.\nMam and Bridey sit so close to the fire their shins turn red and purple and blue. They talk for hours and they whisper and laugh over secret things. We're not supposed to hear the secret things so we're told go out and play. I often sit on the seventh step listening and they have no notion I'm there. It might be lashing rain out but Mam says, Rain or no, out you go, and she'll tell us, If you see your father coming, run in and tell me. Mam says to Bridey, Did you ever hear that poem that someone must have made up about me and him?\nWhat poem, Angela?\n'Tis called \"The Man from the North. \" I got this poem from Minnie MacAdorey in America.\nI never heard that poem. Say it for me.\nMam says the poem but she laughs all through it and I don't know why, He came from the North so his words were few But his voice was kind and his heart was true.\nAnd I knew by his eyes that no guile had he, So I married my man from the North Country.\nOh, Garryowen may be more gay\nThan this quiet man from beside Lough Neagh And I know that the sun shines softly down\nOn the river that runs through my native town.\nBut there's not-and I say it with joy and with pride A better man in all Munster wide\nAnd Limerick town has no happier hearth\nThan mine has been with my man from the North.\nI wish that in Limerick they only knew The kind kind neighbors I came unto. Small hate or scorn would there ever be Between the South and the North Country.\nShe always repeats the third verse and laughs so hard she's crying and I don't know why. She goes into hysterics when she says, And Limerick town has no happier hearth Than mine has been with my man from the North.\nIf he comes back early and sees Bridey in the kitchen the man from the North says, Gossip, gossip, gossip, and stands there with his cap on till she leaves.\nBridey's mother and other people in our lane and lanes beyond will come to the door to ask Dad if he'll write a letter to the government or a relation in a distant place. He sits at the table with his pen and bottle of ink and when the people tell him what to write he says, Och, no, that's not what you want to say, and he writes what he feels like writing. The people tell him that's what they wanted to say in the first place, that he has a lovely way with the English language and a fine fist for the writing. They offer him sixpence for his trouble but he waves it away and they hand it to Mam because he's too grand to be taking sixpence. When the people leave he takes the sixpence and sends me to Kathleen O'Connell's shop for cigarettes.\nGrandma sleeps in a big bed upstairs with a picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus over her head and a statue of the Sacred Heart on the mantel piece. She wants to switch from gaslight to electric light someday so that she'll have a little red light under the statue forever. Her devotion to the Sacred Heart is known up and down the lane and in lanes beyond.\nUncle Pat sleeps in a small bed in a corner of the same room where Grandma can make sure he comes in at a proper hour and kneels by the bed to say his prayers. He might have been dropped on his head, he may not know how to read and write, he may drink one pint too many, but there's no excuse for not saying his prayers before he goes to sleep.\nUncle Pat tells Grandma he met a man who is looking for a place to stay that will let him wash himself morning and night and give him two\nmeals a day, dinner and tea. His name is Bill Galvin and he has a good job down at the lime kiln. He's covered all the time with white lime dust but surely that's better than coal dust.\nGrandma will have to give up her bed and move into the small room. She'll take the Sacred Heart picture and leave the statue to watch over the two men. Besides, she has no place for a statue in her little room.\nBill Galvin comes after work to see the place. He's small, all white, and he snuffles like a dog. He asks Grandma if she'd mind taking down that statue because he's a Protestant and he wouldn't be able to sleep. Grandma barks at Uncle Pat for not telling her he was dragging a Protestant into the house. Jesus, she says, there will be gossip up and down the lane and beyond.\nUncle Pat says he didn't know Bill Galvin was a Protestant. You could never tell by looking at him especially the way he's covered with lime. He looks like an ordinary Catholic and you'd never imagine a Protestant would be shoveling lime.\nBill Galvin says his poor wife that just died was a Catholic and she had the walls covered with pictures of the Sacred Heart and the Virgin Mary showing their hearts. He's not against the Sacred Heart himself, it's just that seeing the statue will remind him of his poor wife and give him the heartache.\nGrandma says, Ah, God help us, why didn't you tell me that in the first place? Sure I can put the statue on the windowsill in my room and your heart won't be tormented at the sight of it.\nEvery morning Grandma cooks Bill's dinner and takes it to him at the lime kiln. Mam wonders why he can't take it with him in the morning and Grandma says, Do you expect me to get up at dawn and boil cabbage and pig's toes for his lordship to take in his dinner can?\nMam tells her, In another week school will be over and if you give Frank sixpence a week he'll surely be glad to take Bill Galvin his dinner.\nI don't want to go to Grandma's every day. I don't want to take Bill Galvin his dinner all the way down the Dock Road, but Mam says that's sixpence we could use and if I don't do it I'm going nowhere else.\nYou're staying in the house, she says. You're not playing with your\npals.\nGrandma warns me to take the dinner can directly and not be\nmeandering, looking this way and that, kicking canisters and ruining the toes of my shoes. This dinner is hot and that's the way Bill Galvin wants\nit.\nThere's a lovely smell from the dinner can, boiled bacon and\ncabbage and two big floury white potatoes. Surely he won't notice if I try half a potato. He won't complain to Grandma because he hardly ever talks outside of a snuffle or two.\nIt's better if I eat the other half potato so that he won't be asking why he got a half. I might as well try the bacon and cabbage too and if I eat the other potato he'll surely think she didn't send one at all.\nThe second potato melts in my mouth and I'll have to try another bit of cabbage, another morsel of bacon. There isn't much left now and he'll be very suspicious so I might as well finish off the rest.\nWhat am I going to do now? Grandma will destroy me, Mam will keep me in for a year. Bill Galvin will bury me in lime. I'll tell him I was\nattacked by a dog on the Dock Road and he ate the whole dinner and I'm lucky I escaped without being eaten myself.\nOh, is that so? says Bill Galvin. And what's that bit of cabbage hanging on your gansey? Did the dog lick you wit his cabbagey gob? Go home and tell your grandmother you ate me whole dinner and I'm falling down with the hunger here in this lime kiln.\nShe'll kill me.\nTell her don't kill you till she sends me some class of a dinner and if you don't go to her now and get me a dinner I'll kill you and throw your body into the lime there and there won't be much left for your mother to moan over.\nGrandma says, What are you doin' back with that can? He could bring that back by himself.\nHe wants more dinner.\nWhat do you mean more dinner? Jesus above, is it a hole he has in his leg?\nHe's falling down with the hunger below in the lime kiln. Is it coddin' me you are?\nHe says send him any class of a dinner.\nI will not. I sent him his dinner.\nHe didn't get it.\nHe didn't? Why not?\nI ate it.\nWhat?\nI was hungry and I tasted it and I couldn't stop.\nJesus, Mary and holy St. Joseph.\nShe gives me a clout on the head that brings tears to my eyes. She\nscreams at me like a banshee and jumps around the kitchen and threatens to drag me to the priest, the bishop, the Pope himself if he lived around the corner. She cuts bread and waves the knife at me and makes sandwiches of brawn and cold potatoes.\nTake these sandwiches to Bill Galvin and if you even look cross- eyed at them I'll skin your hide.\nOf course she runs to Mam and they agree the only way I can make up for my terrible sin is to deliver Bill Galvin's dinner for a fortnight without pay. I'm to bring back the can every day and that means I have to sit watching him stuff the food into his gob and he's not one that would ever ask you if you had a mouth in your head.\nEvery day I take the can back Grandma makes me kneel to the statue of the Sacred Heart and tell Him I'm sorry and all this over Bill Galvin, a Protestant.\nMam says, I'm a martyr for the fags and so is your father.\nThere may be a lack of tea or bread in the house but Mam and Dad always manage to get the fags, the Wild Woodbines. They have to have the Woodbines in the morning and anytime they drink tea. They tell us every day we should never smoke, it's bad for your lungs, it's bad for your chest, it stunts your growth, and they sit by the fire puffing away. Mam says, If 'tis a thing I ever see you with a fag in your gob I'll break your face. They tell us the cigarettes rot your teeth and you can see they're not lying. The teeth turn brown and black in their heads and fall out one by one. Dad says he has holes in his teeth big enough for a sparrow to raise a family. He has a few left but he gets them pulled at the clinic and applies for a false set. When he comes home with the new teeth he shows his big new white smile that makes him look like an\nAmerican and whenever he tells us a ghost story by the fire he pushes the lower teeth up beyond his lip to his nose and frightens the life out of us. Mam's teeth are so bad she has to go to Barrington's Hospital to have them all pulled at the same time and when she comes home she's holding at her mouth a rag bright with blood. She has to sit up all night by the fire because you can't lie down when your gums are pumping blood or you'll choke in your sleep. She says she'll give up smoking entirely when this bleeding stops but she needs one puff of a fag this minute for the comfort that's in it. She tells Malachy go to Kathleen O'Connell's shop and ask her would she ever let her have five Woodbines till Dad collects the dole on Thursday. If anyone can get the fags out of Kathleen, Malachy can. Mam says he has the charm, and she tells me, There's no use sending you with your long puss and your father's odd manner.\nWhen the bleeding stops and Mam's gums heal she goes to the clinic for her false teeth. She says she'll give up the smoking when her new teeth are in but she never does. The new teeth rub on her gums and make them sore and the smoke of the Woodbines eases them. She and Dad sit by the fire when we have one and smoke their cigarettes and when they talk their teeth clack. They try to stop the clacking by moving their jaws back and forth but that only makes it worse and they curse the dentists and the people above in Dublin who made the teeth and while they curse they clack. Dad claims these teeth were made for rich people in Dublin and didn't fit so they were passed on to the poor of Limerick who don't care because you don't have much to chew when you're poor anyway and you're grateful you have any class of a tooth in your head. If they talk too long their gums get sore and the teeth have to come out. Then they sit talking by the fire with their faces collapsed. Every night they leave the teeth in the kitchen in jam jars filled with water. Malachy wants to know why and Dad tells him it cleans them. Mam says, No, you can't have teeth in your head while you're sleeping for they'll slip and choke you to death entirely.\nThe teeth are the cause of Malachy going to Barrington's Hospital and me having an operation. Malachy whispers to me in the middle of the night, Do you want to go downstairs and see if we can wear the teeth?\nThe teeth are so big we have trouble getting them into our mouths but Malachy won't give up. He forces Dad's upper teeth into his mouth and can't get them out again. His lips are drawn back and the teeth make a big grin. He looks like a monster in a film and it makes me laugh but he pulls at them and grunts, Uck, uck, and tears come to his eyes. The more he goes Uck, uck, the harder I laugh till Dad calls from upstairs, What are you boys doing? Malachy runs from me, up the stairs, and now I hear Dad and Mam laughing till they see he can choke on the teeth. They both stick their fingers in to pull out the teeth but Malachy gets frightened and makes desperate uck uck sounds. Mam says, We'll have to take him to the hospital, and Dad says he'll take him. He makes me go in case the doctor has questions because I'm older than Malachy and that means I must have started all the trouble. Dad rushes through the streets with Malachy in his arms and I try to keep up. I feel sorry for Malachy up there on Dad's shoulder, looking back at me, tears on his cheeks and Dad's teeth bulging in his mouth. The doctor at Barrington's Hospital says, No bother. He pours oil into Malachy's mouth and has the teeth out in a minute. Then he looks at me and says to Dad, Why is that child standing there with his mouth hanging open?\nDad says, That's a habit he has, standing with his mouth open.\nThe doctor says, Come here to me. He looks up my nose, in my ears, down my throat, and feels my neck.\nThe tonsils, he says. The adenoids. They have to come out. The sooner the better or he'll look like an idiot when he grows up with that gob wide as a boot.\nNext day Malachy gets a big piece of toffee as a reward for sticking in teeth he can't get out and I have to go to the hospital to have an operation that will close my mouth.\nOn a Saturday morning Mam finishes her tea and says, You're going to dance.\nDance? Why?\nYou're seven years old, you made your First Communion, and now 'tis time for the dancing. I'm taking you down to Catherine Street to Mrs. O'Connor's Irish dancing classes. You'll go there every Saturday morning and that'll keep you off the streets. That'll keep you from wandering around Limerick with hooligans.\nShe tells me wash my face not forgetting ears and neck, comb my hair, blow my nose, take the look off my face, what look? never mind, just take it off, put on my stockings and my First Communion shoes which, she says, are destroyed because I can't pass a canister or a rock without kicking it. She's worn out standing in the queue at the St. Vincent de Paul Society begging for boots for me and Malachy so that we can wear out the toes with the kicking. Your father says it's never too early to learn the songs and dances of your ancestors.\nWhat's ancestors?\nNever mind, she says, you're going to dance.\nI wonder how I can die for Ireland if I have to sing and dance for\nIreland, too. I wonder why they never say, You can eat sweets and stay home from school and go swimming for Ireland.\nMam says, Don't get smart or I'll warm your ear.\nCyril Benson dances. He has medals hanging from his shoulders to his kneecaps. He wins contests all over Ireland and he looks lovely in his saffron kilt. He's a credit to his mother and he gets his name in the paper all the time and you can be sure he brings home the odd few pounds. You don't see him roaming the streets kicking everything in sight till the toes hang out of his boots, oh, no, he's a good boy, dancing for his poor mother.\nMam wets an old towel and scrubs my face till it stings, she wraps the towel around her finger and sticks it in my ears and claims there's enough wax there to grow potatoes, she wets my hair to make it lie down, she tells me shut up and stop the whinging, that these dancing lessons will cost her sixpence every Saturday, which I could have earned bringing Bill Galvin his dinner and God knows she can barely afford it. I try to tell her, Ah, Mam, sure you don't have to send me to dancing school when you could be smoking a nice Woodbine and having a cup of tea, but she says, Oh, aren't you clever. You're going to dance if I have to give up the fags forever.\nIf my pals see my mother dragging me through the streets to an Irish dancing class I'll be disgraced entirely. They think it's all right to dance and pretend you're Fred Astaire because you can jump all over the screen with Ginger Rogers. There is no Ginger Rogers in Irish dancing and you can't jump all over. You stand straight up and down and keep your arms against yourself and kick your legs up and around and never smile.\nMy uncle Pa Keating said Irish dancers look like they have steel rods up their arses, but I can't say that to Mam, she'd kill me.\nThere's a gramophone in Mrs. O'Connor's playing an Irish jig or a reel and boys and girls are dancing around kicking their legs out and keeping their hands to their sides. Mrs. O'Connor is a great fat woman and when she stops the record to show the steps all the fat from her chin to her ankles jiggles and I wonder how she can teach the dancing. She comes over to my mother and says, So, this is little Frankie? I think we have the makings of a dancer here. Boys and girls, do we have the makings of a dancer here?\nWe do, Mrs. O'Connor.\nMam says, I have the sixpence, Mrs. O'Connor.\nAh, yes, Mrs. McCourt, hold on a minute.\nShe waddles to a table and brings back the head of a black boy with\nkinky hair, big eyes, huge red lips and an open mouth. She tells me put the sixpence in the mouth and take my hand out before the black boy bites me. All the boys and girls watch and they have little smiles. I drop in the sixpence and pull my hand back before the mouth snaps shut. Everyone laughs and I know they wanted to see my hand caught in the mouth. Mrs. O'Connor gasps and laughs and says to my mother, Isn't that a howl, now? Mam says it's a howl. She tells me behave myself and come home dancing. I don't want to stay in this place where Mrs. O'Connor can't take the sixpence herself instead of letting me nearly lose my hand in the black boy's mouth.\nI don't want to stay in this place where you have to stand in line with boys and girls, straighten your back, hands by your sides, look ahead, don't look down, move your feet, move your feet, look at Cyril, look at Cyril, and there goes Cyril, all dressed up in his saffron kilt and the medals jingling, medals for this and medals for that and the girls love Cyril and Mrs. O'Connor loves Cyril for didn't he bring her fame and didn't she teach him every step he knows, oh, dance, Cyril, dance, oh, Jesus, he floats around the room, he's an angel out of heaven and stop the frowning, Frankie McCourt, or you'll have a puss on you like a pound of tripe, dance, Frankie, dance, pick up your feet for the love o' Jesus, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree, Maura, will you help that Frankie McCourt before he ties his two feet around his poll entirely, help him, Maura.\nMaura is a big girl about ten. She dances up to me with her white teeth and her dancer's dress with all the gold and yellow and green figures that are supposed to come from olden times and she says, Give me your hand, little boy, and she wheels me around the room till I'm dizzy and making a pure eejit of myself and blushing and foolish till I want to cry but I'm saved when the record stops and the gramophone goes hoosh hoosh.\nMrs. O'Connor says, Oh, thank you, Maura, and next week, Cyril, you can show Frankie a few of the steps that made you famous. Next week, boys and girls, and don't forget the sixpence for the little black boy.\nBoys and girls leave together. I make my own way down the stairs and out the door hoping my pals won't see me with boys who wear kilts and girls with white teeth and fancy dresses from olden times.\nMam is having tea with Bridey Hannon, her friend from next door. Mam says, What did you learn? and makes me dance around the kitchen, onetwothreefourfivesixseven onetwothree and a onetwothree. She has a good\nlaugh with Bridey. That's not too bad for your first time. In a month you'll be like a regular Cyril Benson.\nI don't want to be Cyril Benson. I want to be Fred Astaire.\nThey turn hysterical, laughing and squirting tea out of their mouths, Jesus love him, says Bridey. Doesn't he have a great notion of himself. Fred Astaire how are you.\nMam says Fred Astaire went to his lessons every Saturday and didn't go around kicking the toes out of his boots and if I wanted to be like him I'd have to go to Mrs. O'Connor's every week.\nThe fourth Saturday morning Billy Campbell knocks at our door. Mrs. McCourt, can Frankie come out and play? Mam tells him, No, Billy. Frankie is going to his dancing lesson.\nHe waits for me at the bottom of Barrack Hill. He wants to know why I'm dancing, that everyone knows dancing is a sissy thing and I'll wind up like Cyril Benson wearing a kilt and medals and dancing all over with girls. He says next thing I'll be sitting in the kitchen knitting socks. He says dancing will destroy me and I won't be fit to play any kind of football, soccer, rugby or Gaelic football itself because the dancing teaches you to run like a sissy and everyone will laugh.\nI tell him I'm finished with the dancing, that I have sixpence in my pocket for Mrs. O'Connor that's supposed to go into the black boy's mouth, that I'm going to the Lyric Cinema instead. Sixpence will get the two of us in with tuppence left over for two squares of Cleeves' toffee, and we have a great time looking at Riders of the Purple Sage.\nDad is sitting by the fire with Mam and they want to know what steps I learned today and what they're called. I already did \"The Siege of Ennis\" and \"The Walls of Limerick, \" which are real dances. Now I have to make up names and dances. Mam says she never heard of a dance called \"The Siege of Dingle\"but if that's what I learned go ahead, dance it, and I dance around the kitchen with my hands down by my sides making my own music, diddley eye di eye di eye diddley eye do you do you, Dad and Mam clapping in time with my feet. Dad says, Och, that's a fine dance and you'll be a powerful Irish dancer and a credit to the men who died for their country. Mam says, That wasn't much for a sixpence.\nNext week it's a George Raft film and the week after that a cowboy film with George O'Brien. Then it's James Cagney and I can't take Billy because I want to get a bar of chocolate to go with my Cleeves' toffee and I'm having a great time till there's a terrible pain in my jaw and it's a tooth out of my gum stuck in my toffee and the pain is killing me. Still, I can't waste the toffee so I pull out the tooth and put it in my pocket and chew the toffee on the other side of my mouth blood and all. There's pain on one side and delicious toffee on the other and I remember what my uncle Pa Keating would say, There are times when you wouldn't know whether to shit or go blind.\nI have to go home now and worry because you can't go through the world short a tooth without your mother knowing. Mothers know everything and she's always looking into our mouths to see if there's any class of disease. She's there by the fire and Dad is there and they're asking me the same old questions, the dance and the name of the dance. I tell them I learned \"The Walls of Cork\" and I dance around the kitchen trying to hum a made up tune and dying with the pain of my tooth. Mam says, \"Walls o' Cork, \" my eye, there's no such dance, and Dad says, Come over here. Stand there before me. Tell us the truth, Did you go to your dancing classes today?\nI can't tell a lie anymore because my gum is killing me and there's blood in my mouth. Besides, I know they know everything and that's what they're telling me now. Some snake of a boy from the dancing school saw me going to the Lyric Cinema and told and Mrs. O'Connor sent a note to say she hadn't seen me in ages and was I all right because I had great promise and could follow in the footsteps of the great Cyril Benson.\nDad doesn't care about my tooth or anything. He says I'm going to confession and drags me over to the Redemptorist church because it's Saturday and confessions go on all day. He tells me I'm a bad boy, he's ashamed of me that I went to the pictures instead of learning Ireland's national dances, the jig, the reel, the dances that men and women fought and died for down those sad centuries. He says there's many a young man that was hanged and now moldering in a lime pit that would be glad to rise up and dance the Irish dance.\nThe priest is old and I have to yell my sins at him and he tells me I'm a hooligan for going to the pictures instead of my dancing lessons although he thinks himself that dancing is a dangerous thing almost as bad as the films, that it stirs up thoughts sinful in themselves, but even if dancing is an abomination I sinned by taking my mother's sixpence and lying and there's a hot place in hell for the likes of me, say a decade of the rosary and ask God's forgiveness for you're dancing at the gates of hell itself, child.\nI'm seven, eight, nine going on ten and still Dad has no work. He drinks his tea in the morning, signs for the dole at the Labour Exchange, reads the papers at the Carnegie Library, goes for his long walks far into the country. If he gets a job at the Limerick Cement Company or Rank's Flour Mills he loses it in the third week. He loses it because he goes to the pubs on the third Friday of the job, drinks all his wages and misses the half day of work on Saturday morning.\nMam says, Why can't he be like the other men from the lanes of Limerick? They're home before the Angelus rings at six o'clock, they hand over their wages, change their shirts, have their tea, get a few shillings from the wife and they're off to the pub for a pint or two.\nMam tells Bridey Hannon that Dad can't be like that and won't be like that. She says he's a right bloody fool the way he goes to pubs and stands pints to other men while his own children are home with their bellies stuck to their backbones for the want of a decent dinner. He'll brag to the world he did his bit for Ireland when it was neither popular nor profitable, that he'll gladly die for Ireland when the call comes, that he regrets he has only one life to give for his poor misfortunate country and if anyone disagrees they're invited to step outside and settle this for once and for all.\nOh, no, says Mam, they won't disagree and they won't step outside, that bunch of tinkers and knackers and begrudgers that hang around the pubs. They tell him he's a grand man, even if he's from the North, and 'twould be an honor to accept a pint from such a patriot.\nMam tells Bridey, I don't know under God what I'm going to do. The dole is nineteen shillings and sixpence a week, the rent is six and six, and that leaves thirteen shillings to feed and clothe five people and keep us warm in the winter.\nBridey drags on her Woodbine, drinks her tea and declares that God is good. Mam says she's sure God is good for someone somewhere but He hasn't been seen lately in the lanes of Limerick.\nBridey laughs. Oh, Angela, you could go to hell for that, and Mam says, Aren't I there already, Bridey?\nAnd they laugh and drink their tea and smoke their Woodbines and tell one another the fag is the only comfort they have.\n'Tis.\nQuestion Quigley tells me I have to go to the Redemptorist church on Friday and join the boys' division of the Arch Confraternity. You have to join. You can't say no. All the boys in the lanes and back streets that have fathers on the dole or working in laboring jobs have to join.\nQuestion says, Your father is a foreigner from the North and he don't matter but you still have to join.\nEveryone knows Limerick is the holiest city in Ireland because it has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family, the biggest sodality in the world. Any city can have a Confraternity, only Limerick has the Arch.\nOur Confraternity fills the Redemptorist church five nights a week, three for the men, one for the women, one for the boys. There is Benediction and hymn singing in English, Irish and Latin and best of all the big powerful sermon Redemptorist priests are famous for. It's the sermon that saves millions of Chinese and other heathens from winding up in hell with the Protestants.\nThe Question says you have to join the Confraternity so that your mother can tell the St. Vincent de Paul Society and they'll know you're a good Catholic. He says his father is a loyal member and that's how he got a good pensionable job cleaning lavatories at the railway station and when he grows up himself he'll get a good job too unless he runs away and joins the Royal Canadian Mounted Police so that he can sing \"I'll Be Calling You Ooo Ooo Ooo, \" like Nelson Eddy singing to Jeanette MacDonald expiring with consumption there on the sofa. If he brings me to the Confraternity the man in the office will write his name in a big book and some day he might be promoted to prefect of a section, which is all he wants in life next to wearing the Mountie uniform.\nThe prefect is head of a section which is thirty boys from the same lanes and streets. Every section has the name of a saint whose picture is painted on a shield stuck on top of a pole by the prefect's seat. The prefect and his assistant take the attendance and keep an eye on us so that they can give us a thump on the head in case we laugh during Benediction or commit any other sacrileges. If you miss one night the man in the office wants to know why, wants to know if you're slipping away from the Confraternity or he might say to the other man in the office, I think our little friend here has taken the soup. That's the worst thing you can say to any Catholic in Limerick or Ireland itself because of what happened in the Great Famine. If you're absent twice the man in the office sends you a yellow summons to appear and explain yourself and if you're absent three times he sends The Posse, which is five or six big boys from your section who search the streets to make sure you're not out enjoying yourself when you should be on your knees at the Confraternity praying for the Chinese and other lost souls. The Posse will go to your house and tell your mother your immortal soul is in danger. Some mothers worry but others will say, Get away from my door or I'll come out and give every one o' ye a good fong in the hole of yeer arse. These are not good Confraternity mothers and the director will say we should pray for them that they'll see the error of their ways.\nThe worst thing of all is a visit from the director of the Confraternity himself, Father Gorey. He'll stand at the top of the lane\nand roar in the voice that converted the Chinese millions, Where is the house of Frank McCourt? He roars even though he has your address in his pocket and knows very well where you live. He roars because he wants the world to know you're slipping away from the Confraternity and putting your immortal soul in danger. The mothers are terrified and the fathers will whisper, I'm not here, I'm not here, and they'll make sure you go to the Confraternity from this on out so they won't be disgraced and shamed entirely with the neighbors muttering behind their hands.\nThe Question takes me to the section St. Finbar's, and the prefect tells me sit over there and shut up. His name is Declan Collopy, he's fourteen and he has lumps on his forehead that look like horns. He has thick ginger eyebrows that meet in the middle and hang over his eyes and his arms hang down to his kneecaps. He tells me he's making this the best section in the Confraternity and if I'm ever absent he'll break my arse and send the bits to my mother. There's no excuse for absence because there was a boy in another section that was dying and still they brought him in on a stretcher. He says, If you're ever absent it better be a death, not a death in the family but your own death. Do you hear me?\nI do, Declan.\nBoys in my section tell me that prefects get rewards if there is perfect attendance. Declan wants to get out of school as soon as he can and get a job selling linoleum at Cannock's big shop on Patrick Street. His uncle, Foncey, sold linoleum there for years and made enough money to start his own shop in Dublin, where he has his three sons selling linoleum. Father Gorey, the director, can easily get Declan the reward of a job at Cannock's if he's a good prefect and has perfect attendance in his section and that's why Declan will destroy us if we're absent. He tells us, No one will stand between me and the linoleum.\nDeclan likes Question Quigley and lets him miss an occasional Friday night because the Question said, Declan, when I grow up and get married I'm going to cover my house in linoleum and I'll buy it all from you.\nOther boys in the section try this trick with Declan but he says, Bugger off, ye'll be lucky enough to have a pot to piss in never mind yards of linoleum.\nDad says when he was my age in Toome he served Mass for years and it's time for me to be an altar boy. Mam says, What's the use? The child doesn't have proper clothes for school never mind the altar. Dad says the altar boy robes will cover the clothes and she says we don't have the money for robes and the wash they need every week.\nHe says God will provide and makes me kneel on the kitchen floor. He takes the part of the priest for he has the whole Mass in his head and I have to know the responses. He says, Introibo ad altare Dei, and I have to say, Ad Deum qui laetificat juventutem meam.\nEvery evening after tea I kneel for the Latin and he won't let me move till I'm perfect. Mam says he could at least let me sit but he says Latin is sacred and it is to be learned and recited on the knees. You won't find the Pope sitting around drinking tea while he speaks the Latin.\nThe Latin is hard and my knees are sore and scabby and I'd like to be out in the lane playing though still I'd like to be an altar boy helping the priest vest in the sacristy, up there on the altar all decked out in my red and white robes like my pal Jimmy Clark, answering the priest in Latin, moving the big book from one side of the tabernacle to\nthe other, pouring water and wine into the chalice, pouring water over the priest's hands, ringing the bell at Consecration, kneeling, bowing, swinging the censer at Benediction, sitting off to the side with the palms of my hands on my knees all serious while he gives his sermon, everyone in St. Joseph's looking at me and admiring my ways.\nIn a fortnight I have the Mass in my head and it's time to go to St. Joseph's to see the sacristan, Stephen Carey, who is in charge of altar boys. Dad polishes my boots. Mam darns my socks and throws an extra coal on the fire to heat up the iron to press my shirt. She boils water to scrub my head, neck, hands and knees and any inch of skin that shows. She scrubs till my skin burns and tells Dad she wouldn't give it to the world to say her son went on the altar dirty. She wishes I didn't have scabby knees from running around kicking canisters and falling down pretending I was the greatest footballer in the world. She wishes we had a drop of hair oil in the house but water and spit will keep my hair from sticking up like black straw in a mattress. She warns me speak up when I go to St. Joseph's and don't be mumbling in English or Latin. She says, 'Tis a great pity you grew out of your First Communion suit but you have nothing to be ashamed of, you come from good blood, McCourts, Sheehans, or my mother's family the Guilfoyles that owned acre after acre in County Limerick before the English took it away and gave it to footpads from London.\nDad holds my hand going through the streets and people look at us because of the way we're saying Latin back and forth. He knocks at the sacristy door and tells Stephen Carey, This is my son, Frank, who knows the Latin and is ready to be an altar boy.\nStephen Carey looks at him, then me. He says, We don't have room for him, and closes the door.\nDad is still holding my hand and squeezes till it hurts and I want to cry out. He says nothing on the way home. He takes off his cap, sits by the fire and lights a Woodbine. Mam is smoking, too. Well, she says, is he going to be an altar boy?\nThere's no room for him.\nOh. She puffs on her Woodbine. I'll tell you what it is, she says. 'Tis class distinction. They don't want boys from lanes on the altar. They don't want the ones with scabby knees and hair sticking up. Oh, no, they want the nice boys with hair oil and new shoes that have fathers with suits and ties and steady jobs. That's what it is and 'tis hard to hold on to the Faith with the snobbery that's in it.\nOch, aye.\nOh, och aye my arse. That's all you ever say. You could go to the priest and tell him you have a son that has a head stuffed with Latin and why can't he be an altar boy and what is he going to do with all that Latin?\nOch, he might grow up to be a priest.\nI ask him if I can go out and play. Yes, he says, go out and play. Mam says, You might as well.\nVI\nMr. O'Neill is the master in the fourth class at school. We call him Dotty because he's small like a dot. He teaches in the one classroom with\na platform so that he can stand above us and threaten us with his ash plant and peel his apple for all to see. The first day of school in September he writes on the blackboard three words which are to stay there the rest of the year, Euclid, geometry, idiot. He says if he catches any boy interfering with these words that boy will go through the rest of his life with one hand. He says anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Now, repeat after me, Anyone who doesn't understand the theorems of Euclid is an idiot. Of course we all know what an idiot is because that's what the masters keep telling us we are.\nBrendan Quigley raises his hand. Sir, what's a theorem and what's a Euclid?\nWe expect Dotty to lash at Brendan the way all the masters do when you ask them a question but he looks at Brendan with a little smile. Ah, now, here's a boy with not one but two questions. What is your name, boy?\nBrendan Quigley, sir.\nThis is a boy who will go far. Where will he go, boys?\nFar, sir.\nIndeed and he will. The boy who wants to know something about the\ngrace, elegance and beauty of Euclid can go nowhere but up. In what direction and no other can this boy go, boys?\nUp, sir.\nWithout Euclid, boys, mathematics would be a poor doddering thing. Without Euclid we wouldn't be able to go from here to there. Without Euclid the bicycle would have no wheel. Without Euclid St. Joseph could not have been a carpenter for carpentry is geometry and geometry is carpentry. Without Euclid this very school could never have been built.\nPaddy Clohessy mutters behind me, Feckin' Euclid.\nDotty barks at him. You, boy, what is your name?\nClohessy, sir.\nAh, the boy flies on one wing. What is your Christian name? Paddy.\nPaddy what?\nPaddy, sir.\nAnd what, Paddy, were you saying to McCourt? I said we\ndown on our two knees and thank God for Euclid.\nI'm sure you did, Clohessy. I see the lie festering in\nWhat do I see, boys?\nThe lie, sir.\nAnd what is the lie doing, boys?\nFestering, sir.\nWhere, boys, where?\nIn his teeth, sir.\nEuclid, boys, was a Greek. What, Clohessy, is a Greek? Some class of a foreigner, sir.\nClohessy, you are a half-wit. Now, Brendan, surely you\nshould get\nyour teeth.\nknow what a\nGreek is?\nYes, sir. Euclid was a Greek.\nDotty gives him the little smile. He tells Clohessy he should model\nhimself on Quigley, who knows what a Greek is. He draws two lines side by side and tells us these are parallel lines and the magical and mysterious thing is that they never meet, not if they were to be extended to infinity, not if they were extended to God's shoulders and that, boys, is a long way though there is a German Jew who is upsetting the whole world with his ideas on parallel lines.\nWe listen to Dotty and wonder what all this has to do with the state of the world with the Germans marching everywhere and bombing everything that stands. We can't ask him ourselves but we can get Brendan Quigley to do it. Anyone can see Brendan is the master's pet and that means he can ask any question he likes. After school we tell Brendan he has to ask the question tomorrow, What use is Euclid and all those lines that go on forever when the Germans are bombing everything? Brendan says he doesn't want to be the master's pet, he didn't ask for it, and he doesn't want to ask the question. He's afraid if he asks that question Dotty will attack him. We tell him if he doesn't ask the question we'll attack him.\nNext day Brendan raises his hand. Dotty gives him the little smile. Sir, what use is Euclid and all the lines when the Germans are bombing everything that stands?\nThe little smile is gone. Ah, Brendan. Ah, Quigley. Oh, boys, oh, boys.\nHe lays his stick on the desk and stands on the platform with his eyes closed. What use is Euclid? he says. Use? Without Euclid the Messerschmitt could never have taken to the sky. Without Euclid the Spitfire could not dart from cloud to cloud. Euclid brings us grace and beauty and elegance. What does he bring us, boys?\nGrace, sir.\nAnd?\nBeauty, sir.\nAnd?\nElegance, sir.\nEuclid is complete in himself and divine in application. Do you\nunderstand that, boys?\nWe do, sir.\nI doubt it, boys, I doubt it. To love Euclid is to be alone in this world.\nHe opens his eyes and sighs and you can see the eyes are a little watery.\nPaddy Clohessy is leaving the school that day and he's stopped by Mr. O'Dea, who teaches the fifth class. Mr. O'Dea says, You, what's your\nname?\nClohessy, sir.\nWhat class are you in?\nFourth class, sir.\nNow tell me, Clohessy, is that master of yours talking to you about\nEuclid?\nHe is, sir.\nAnd what is he saying?\nHe's saying he's a Greek.\nOf course he is, you diddering omadhaun. What else is he saying? He's saying there would be no school without Euclid.\nAh. Now is he drawing anything on the board?\nHe's drawing lines side by side that will never meet even if they\nland on God's shoulders.\nMother o' God.\nNo, sir. God's shoulders.\nI know, you idiot. Go home.\nThe next day there's a great noise at our classroom door and Mr. O'Dea is yelling, Come out, O'Neill, you chancer, you poltroon. We can hear everything he's saying because of the broken glass over the door.\nThe new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, is saying, Now, now, Mr. O'Dea. Control yourself. No quarreling in front of our pupils.\nWell, then, Mr. O'Halloran, tell him stop teaching the geometry. The geometry is for the fifth form and not the fourth. The geometry is mine. Tell him to teach the long division and leave Euclid to me. Long division will stretch his intellect such as it is, God help us. I don't want the minds of these boys destroyed by that chancer up there on the platform, him handing out apple skins and causing diarrhea right and left. Tell him Euclid is mine, Mr. O'Halloran, or I'll put a stop to his gallop.\nMr. O'Halloran tells Mr. O'Dea to return to his classroom and asks Mr. O'Neill to step into the hall. Mr. O'Halloran says, Now, Mr. O'Neill, I have asked you before to stay away from Euclid.\nYou have, Mr. O'Halloran, but you might as well ask me to stop eating my daily apple.\nI'll have to insist, Mr. O'Neill. No more Euclid.\nMr. O'Neill comes back to the room and his eyes are watery again. He says little has changed since the time of the Greeks for the barbarians are within the gates and their names are legion. What has changed since the time of the Greeks, boys?\nIt is torture to watch Mr. O'Neill peel the apple every day, to see the length of it, red or green, and if you're up near him to catch the freshness of it in your nose. If you're the good boy for that day and you answer the questions he gives it to you and lets you eat it there at your desk so that you can eat it in peace with no one to bother you the way they would if you took it into the yard. Then they'd torment you, Gimme a piece, gimme a piece, and you'd be lucky to have an inch left for yourself.\nThere are days when the questions are too hard and he torments us by dropping the apple peel into the wastebasket. Then he borrows a boy from another class to take the wastebasket down to the furnace to burn papers and apple peel or he'll leave it for the charwoman, Nellie Ahearn, to take it all away in her big canvas sack. We'd like to ask Nellie to keep the peel for us before the rats get it but she's weary from cleaning the whole school by herself and she snaps at us, I have other things to be doin' with me life besides watchin' a scabby bunch rootin' around for the skin of an apple. Go 'way.\nHe peels the apple slowly. He looks around the room with the little smile. He teases us, Do you think, boys, I should give this to the pigeons on the windowsill? We say, No, sir, pigeons don't eat apples. Paddy Clohessy calls out, 'Twill give them the runs, sir, and we'll have it on our heads abroad in the yard.\nClohessy, you are an omadhaun. Do you know what an omadhaun is?\nI don't, sir.\nIt's the Irish, Clohessy, your native tongue, Clohessy. An omadhaun\nis a fool, Clohessy. You are an omadhaun. What is he, boys? An omadhaun, sir.\nClohessy says, That's what Mr. O'Dea called me, sir, a diddering omadhaun.\nHe pauses in his peeling to ask us questions about everything in the world and the boy with the best answers wins. Hands up, he says, who is the President of the United States of America?\nEvery hand in the class goes up and we're all disgusted when he asks a question that any omadhaun would know. We call out, Roosevelt.\nThen he says, You, Mulcahy, who stood at the foot of the cross when Our Lord was crucified?\nMulcahy is slow. The Twelve Apostles, sir. Mulcahy, what is the Irish word for fool? Omadhaun, sir.\nAnd what are you, Mulcahy?\nAn omadhaun, sir.\nFintan Slattery raises his hand. I know who stood at the foot of the cross, sir.\nOf course Fintan knows who stood at the foot of the cross. Why wouldn't he? He's always running off to Mass with his mother, who is known for her holiness. She's so holy her husband ran off to Canada to cut down trees, glad to be gone and never to be heard from again. She and Fintan say the rosary every night on their knees in the kitchen and read all kinds of religious magazines: The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart, The Lantern, The Far East, as well as every little book printed by the Catholic Truth Society. They go to Mass and Communion rain or shine and every Saturday they confess to the Jesuits who are known for their interest in intelligent sins not the usual sins you hear from people in lanes who are known for getting drunk and sometimes eating meat on Fridays before it goes bad and cursing on top of it. Fintan and his mother live on Catherine Street and Mrs. Slattery's neighbors call her Mrs. Offer-It-Up because no matter what happens, a broken leg, a spilled cup of tea, a disappeared husband, she says, Well, now, I'll offer that up and I'll have no end of Indulgences to get me into heaven. Fintan is just as bad. If you push him in the schoolyard or call him names he'll smile and tell you he'll pray for you and he'll offer it up for his soul and yours. The boys in Leamy's don't want Fintan praying for them and they threaten to give him a good fong in the arse if they catch him praying for them. He says he wants to be a saint when he grows up, which is ridiculous because you can't be a saint till you're dead. He says our grandchildren will be praying to his picture. One big boy says, My grandchildren will piss on your picture, and Fintan just smiles. His sister ran away to England when she was seventeen and everyone knows he wears her blouse at home and curls his hair with hot iron tongs every Saturday night so that he'll look gorgeous at Mass on Sunday. If he meets you going to Mass he'll say, Isn't my hair gorgeous, Frankie? He loves that word, gorgeous, and no other boy will ever use it.\nOf course he knows who stood at the foot of the cross. He probably knows what they were wearing and what they had for breakfast and now he's telling Dotty O'Neill it was the three Marys. Dotty says, Come up here, Fintan, and take your reward. He takes his time going to the platform and we can't believe our eyes when he takes out a pocketknife to cut the apple peel into little bits so that he can eat them one by one and not be stuffing the whole thing into his mouth like the rest of us when we win. He raises his hand, Sir, I'd like to give some of my apple away.\nThe apple, Fintan? No, indeed. You do not have the apple, Fintan. You have the peel, the mere skin. You have not nor will you ever achieve\nheights so dizzy you'll be feasting on the apple itself. Not my apple, Fintan. Now did I hear you say you want to give away your reward?\nYou did, sir. I'd like to give three pieces, to Quigley, Clohessy and McCourt.\nWhy, Fintan?\nThey're my friends, sir.\nThe boys around the room are sneering and nudging each other and I\nfeel ashamed because they'll say I curl my hair and I'll be tormented in the schoolyard and why does he think I'm his friend? If they say I wear my sister's blouse there's no use telling them I don't have a sister because they'll say, You'd wear it if you had a sister. There's no use saying anything in the schoolyard because there's always someone with an answer and there's nothing you can do but punch them in the nose and if you were to punch everyone who has an answer you'd be punching morning noon and night.\nQuigley takes the bit of peel from Fintan. Thanks, Fintan.\nThe whole class is looking at Clohessy because he's the biggest and the toughest and if he says thanks I'll say thanks. He says, Thanks very much, Fintan, and blushes and I say, Thanks very much, Fintan, and I try to stop myself from blushing but I can't and all the boys sneer again and I'd like to hit them.\nAfter school the boys call to Fintan, Hoi, Fintan, are you goin'home to curl your gorgeous hair? Fintan smiles and climbs the steps of the schoolyard. A big boy from seventh class says to Paddy Clohessy, I suppose you'd be curlin' your hair too if you wasn't a baldy with a shaved head.\nPaddy says, Shurrup, and the boy says, Oh, an' who's goin' to make me? Paddy tries a punch but the big boy hits his nose and knocks him down and there's blood. I try to hit the big boy but he grabs me by the throat and bangs my head against the wall till I see lights and black dots. Paddy walks away holding his nose and crying and the big boy pushes me after him. Fintan is outside on the street and he says, Oh, Francis, Francis, oh, Patrick, Patrick, what's up? Why are you crying, Patrick? and Paddy says, I'm hungry. I can't fight nobody because I'm starving with the hunger an' fallin' down an' I'm ashamed of meself.\nFintan says, Come with me, Patrick. My mother will give us something, and Paddy says, Ah, no, me nose is bleedin'.\nDon't worry. She'll put something on your nose or a key on the back of your neck. Francis, you must come, too. You always look hungry.\nAh, no, Fintan.\nAh, do, Francis.\nAll right, Fintan.\nFintan's flat is like a chapel. There are two pictures, the Sacred\nHeart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Jesus is showing His heart with the crown of thorns, the fire, the blood. His head is tilted to the left to show His great sorrow. The Virgin Mary is showing her heart and it would be a pleasant heart if it didn't have that crown of thorns. Her head is tilted to the right to show her sorrow because she knows her Son will come to a sad end.\nThere's a picture on another wall of a man with a brown robe and birds sitting all over him. Fintan says, Do you know who that is, Francis? No? That's your patron, St. Francis of Assisi, and do you know what today is?\nThe fourth of October.\nThat's right and it's his feast day and special for you because you can ask St. Francis for anything and he'll surely give it to you. That's why I wanted you to come here today. Sit down, Patrick, sit down, Francis.\nMrs. Slattery comes in with her rosary beads in her hand. She's happy to meet Fintan's new friends and would we like a cheese sandwich? And look at your poor nose, Patrick. She touches his nose with the cross on her rosary beads and says a little prayer. She tells us these rosary beads were blessed by the Pope himself and would stop the flow of a river if requested never mind Patrick's poor nose.\nFintan says he won't have a sandwich because he's fasting and praying for the boy who hit Paddy and me. Mrs. Slattery gives him a kiss on the head and tells him he's a saint out of heaven and asks if we'd like mustard on our sandwiches and I tell her I never heard of mustard on cheese and I'd love it. Paddy says, I dunno. I never had a sangwidge in me life, and we all laugh and I wonder how you could live ten years like Paddy and never have a sandwich. Paddy laughs, too, and you can see his teeth are white and black and green.\nWe eat the sandwich and drink tea and Paddy wants to know where the lavatory is. Fintan takes him through the bedroom to the backyard and when they come back Paddy says, I have to go home. Me mother'll kill me. I'll wait for you outside, Frankie.\nNow I have to go to the lavatory and Fintan leads me to the backyard. He says, I have to go, too, and when I unbutton my fly I can't pee because he's looking at me and he says, You were fooling. You don't have to go at all. I like to look at you, Francis. That's all. I wouldn't want to commit any class of a sin with our Confirmation coming next year.\nPaddy and I leave together. I'm bursting and run behind a garage to pee. Paddy is waiting for me and as we walk along Hartstonge Street he says, That was a powerful sangwidge, Frankie, an' him an' his mother is very holy but I wouldn't want to go to Fintan's flat anymore because he's very odd, isn't he, Frankie?\nHe is, Paddy.\nThe way he looks at it when you take it out, that's odd, isn't it, Frankie?\n'Tis, Paddy.\nA few days later Paddy whispers, Fintan Slattery said we could come to his flat at lunchtime. His mother won't be there and she leaves his lunch for him. He might give us some too and he has lovely milk. Will we go?\nFintan sits two rows from us. He knows what Paddy is saying to me and he moves his eyebrows up and down as if to say, Will you come? I whisper yes to Paddy and he nods to Fintan and the master barks at us to stop waggling our eyebrows and our lips or the ash plant will sing across our backsides.\nBoys in the schoolyard see the three of us walk out and they pass remarks. Oh, Gawd, look at Fintan and his ingles. Paddy says, Fintan, what's an ingle? and Fintan says it's just a boy from olden times who sits in a corner, that's all. He tells us sit at the table in his kitchen and we can read his comic books if we like, Film Fun, the Beano, the Dandy, or the religious magazines or his mother's romance magazines, the Miracle and the Oracle, which always have stories about factory girls who are poor but beautiful in love with sons of earls and vice versa and the factory girl ends up throwing herself into the Thames with the\nhopelessness only to be rescued by a passing carpenter who is poor but honest and will love the factory girl for her own humble self though it turns out the passing carpenter is really the son of a duke, which is much higher than an earl, so that now the poor factory girl is a duchess and can look down her nose at the earl who spurned her because she's happy tending her roses on her twelve-thousand-acre estate in Shropshire and being kind to her poor old mother, who refuses to leave her humble little cottage for all the money in the world.\nPaddy says, I don't want to read nothing, it's all a cod, all them stories. Fintan removes the cloth covering his sandwich and glass of milk. The milk looks creamy and cool and delicious and the sandwich bread is almost as white. Paddy says, Is that a ham sangwidge? and Fintan says, 'Tis. Paddy says, That's a lovely looking sangwidge and is there mustard on it? Fintan nods and slices the sandwich in two. Mustard seeps out. He licks it off his fingers and takes a nice mouthful of milk. He cuts the sandwich again into quarters, eighths, sixteenths, takes The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart from the pile of magazines and reads while he eats his sandwich bits and drinks his milk and Paddy and I look at him and I know Paddy is wondering what we're doing here at all, at all, because that's what I'm wondering myself hoping Fintan will pass over the plate to us but he doesn't, he finishes the milk, leaves bits of sandwich on the plate, covers it with the cloth and wipes his lips in his dainty way, lowers his head, blesses himself and says grace after meals and, God, we'll be late for school, and blesses himself again on the way out with holy water from the little china font hanging by the door with the little image of the Virgin Mary showing her heart and pointing at it with two fingers as if we couldn't make it out for ourselves.\nIt's too late for Paddy and me to run and get the bun and milk from Nellie Ahearn and I don't know how I'm going to last from now till I can run home after school and get a piece of bread. Paddy stops at the school gate. He says, I can't go in there starving with the hunger. I'd fall asleep and Dotty'd kill me.\nFintan is anxious. Come on, come on, we'll be late. Come on, Francis, hurry up.\nI'm not going in, Fintan. You had your lunch. We had nothing.\nPaddy explodes. You're a feckin' chancer, Fintan. That's what you are an' a feckin' begrudger too with your feckin' sangwidge an' your feckin' Sacred Heart of Jesus on the wall an' your feckin' holy water. You can kiss my arse, Fintan.\nOh, Patrick.\nOh, Patrick my feckin' arse, Fintan. Come on, Frankie.\nFintan runs into school and Paddy and I make our way to an orchard\nin Ballinacurra. We climb a wall and a fierce dog comes at us till Paddy talks to him and tells him he's a good dog and we're hungry and go home to your mother. The dog licks Paddy's face and trots away waving his tail and Paddy is delighted with himself. We stuff apples into our shirts till we can barely get back over the wall to run into a long field and sit under a hedge eating the apples till we can't swallow another bit and we stick our faces into a stream for the lovely cool water. Then we run to opposite ends of a ditch to shit and wipe ourselves with grass and thick leaves. Paddy is squatting and saying, There's nothing in the world like a good feed of apples, a drink of water and a good shit, better than any sangwidge of cheese and mustard and Dotty O'Neill can shove his apple up his arse.\nThere are three cows in a field with their heads over a stone wall and they say moo to us. Paddy says, Bejasus, 'tis milkin' time, and he's over the wall, stretched on his back under a cow with her big udder hanging into his face. He pulls on a teat and squirts milk into his mouth. He stops squirting and says, Come on, Frankie, fresh milk. 'Tis lovely. Get that other cow, they're all ready for the milkin'.\nI get under the cow and pull on a teat but she kicks and moves and I'm sure she's going to kill me. Paddy comes over and shows me how to do it, pull hard and straight and the milk comes out in a powerful stream. The two of us lie under the one cow and we're having a great time filling ourselves with milk when there's a roar and there's a man with a stick charging across the field. We're over the wall in a minute and he can't follow us because of his rubber boots. He stands at the wall and shakes his stick and shouts that if he ever catches us we'll have the length of his boot up our arses and we laugh because we're out of harm's way and I'm wondering why anyone should be hungry in a world full of milk and apples.\nIt's all right for Paddy to say Dotty can shove the apple up his arse but I don't want to rob orchards and milk cows forever and I'll always try to win Dotty's apple peel so that I can go home and tell Dad how I answered the hard questions.\nWe're walking back through Ballinacurra. There's rain and lightning and we run but it's hard for me with the sole of my shoe flapping and threatening to trip me. Paddy can run all he wants in his long bare feet and you hear them slapping on the pavement. My shoes and stockings are soaked and they make their own sound, squish, squish. Paddy notices that and we make a song from our two sounds, slap slap, squish, squish, slap squish, squish slap. We laugh so hard over our song we have to hold on to one another. The rain gets heavier and we know we can't stand under a tree or we'll be fried entirely so we stand by a door which is opened in a minute by a big fat maid in a little white hat and a black dress with a little white apron who tells us get away from this door we're a disgrace. We run from the door and Paddy calls back, Mullingar heifer, beef to the heels, and he laughs till he chokes and has to lean against a wall with the weakness. There's no sense in standing in from the rain anymore, we're soaked to the skin, so we take our time down O'Connell Avenue. Paddy says he learned that Mullingar heifer thing from his uncle Peter, the one that was in India in the English army and they have a photo of him standing with a group of soldiers with their helmets and guns and bandoliers around their chests and there are dark men in uniform who are Indians and loyal to the King. Uncle Peter had a great time for himself in a place called Kashmir, which is lovelier than Killarney that they're always bragging about and singing. Paddy goes on again about running away and winding up in India in a silken tent with the girl with the red dot and the curry and the figs and he's making me hungry even if I'm stuffed with apples and milk.\nThe rain is clearing and there are birds honking over our heads. Paddy says they're ducks or geese or something on their way to Africa where it's nice and warm. The birds have more sense than the Irish. They come to the Shannon for their holidays and then they go back to the warm places, maybe even India. He says he'll write me a letter when he's over there and I can come to India and have my own girl with a red dot.\nWhat's that dot for, Paddy?\nIt shows they're high class, the quality.\nBut, Paddy, would the quality in India talk to you if they knew you were from a lane in Limerick and had no shoes?\nCourse they would, but the English quality wouldn't. The English quality wouldn't give you the steam of their piss.\nSteam of their piss? God, Paddy, did you think of that yourself?\nNaw, naw, that's what my father says below in the bed when he's coughin' up the gobs and blamin' the English for everything.\nAnd I think, Steam of their piss. I'll keep that for myself. I'll go around Limerick saying it, Steam of their piss, Steam of their piss, and when I go to America some day I'll be the only one who knows it.\nQuestion Quigley is wobbling toward us on a big woman's bicycle and calls to me, Hoi, Frankie McCourt, you're going to be killed. Dotty O'Neill sent a note to your house and said you didn't come back to school after lunch, that you went on the mooch with Paddy Clohessy. Your mother is going to kill you. Your father is out looking for you and he's going to kill you, too.\nOh, God, I feel cold and empty and I wish I could be in India where it's nice and warm and there's no school and my father could never find me to kill me. Paddy tells the Question, He didn't go on the mooch and I didn't either. Fintan Slattery starved us to death and we were too late for the bun and the milk. Then Paddy says to me, Don't mind 'em, Frankie, 'tis all a cod. They're always sendin' notes to our house and we wipe our arses with them.\nMy mother and father would never wipe their arses with a note from the master and I'm afraid now to go home. The Question rides off on the bicycle, laughing, and I don't know why because he once ran away from home and slept in a ditch with four goats and that's worse than mooching from school half a day anytime.\nI could turn up the Barrack Road now and go home and tell my parents I'm sorry I went on the mooch and I did it because of the hunger but Paddy says, Come on, we'll go down the Dock Road and throw rocks in the Shannon.\nWe throw rocks in the river and we swing on the iron chains along the bank. It's getting dark and I don't know where I'm going to sleep. I might have to stay there by the Shannon or find a door or I might have to go back out the country and find a ditch like Brendan Quigley with four goats. Paddy says I can go home with him, I can sleep on the floor and I'll dry out.\nPaddy lives in one of the tall houses on Arthur's Quay looking at the river. Everyone in Limerick knows these houses are old and might fall down at any minute. Mam often says, I don't want any of ye going down to Arthur's Quay and if I find ye there I'll break yeer faces. The people down there are wild and ye could get robbed and killed.\nIt's raining again and small children are playing in the hallway and up the stairs. Paddy says, Mind yourself, because some of the steps are missing and there is shit on the ones that are still there. He says that's because there's only one privy and it's in the backyard and children don't get down the stairs in time to put their little arses on the bowl, God help us.\nThere's a woman with a shawl sitting on the fourth flight smoking a cigarette. She says, Is that you, Paddy?\n'Tis, Mammy.\nI'm fagged out, Paddy. Them steps is killin' me. Did you have your tea?\nI didn't.\nWell, I don't know if there's any bread left. Go up an' see. Paddy's family live in one big room with a high ceiling and a small\nfireplace. There are two tall windows and you can see out to the Shannon. His father is in a bed in the corner, groaning and spitting into a bucket. Paddy's brothers and sisters are on mattresses on the floor, sleeping, talking, looking at the ceiling. There's a baby with no clothes crawling over to Paddy's father's bucket and Paddy pulls him away. His mother comes in, gasping, from the stairs. Jesus, I'm dead, she says.\nShe finds some bread and makes weak tea for Paddy and me. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. They don't say anything. They don't say what are you doing here or go home or anything till Mr. Clohessy says, Who's that? and Paddy tells him, 'Tis Frankie McCourt.\nMr. Clohessy says, McCourt? What class of a name is that? My father is from the North, Mr. Clohessy.\nAnd what's your mother's name?\nAngela, Mr. Clohessy.\nAh, Jaysus, 'twouldn't be Angela Sheehan, would it?\n'Twould, Mr. Clohessy. Ah, Jaysus, he says, and he has a coughing fit which brings up all kinds of stuff from his insides and has him hanging over the bucket. When the cough passes he falls back on the pillow. Ah, Frankie, I knew your mother well. Danced with her, Mother o' Christ, I'm dying inside, danced with her I did below in the Wembley Hall and a champion dancer she was too.\nHe hangs over the bucket again. He gasps for air and reaches his arms out to get it. He suffers but he won't stop talking.\nChampion dancer she was, Frankie. Not skinny mind you but a feather in my arms and there was many a sorry man when she left Limerick. Can you dance, Frankie?\nAh, no, Mr. Clohessy.\nPaddy says, He can, Dada. He had the lessons from Mrs. O'Connor and Cyril Benson.\nWell, dance, Frankie. Round the house an' mind the dresser, Frankie. Lift the foot, lad.\nI can't, Mr. Clohessy. I'm no good.\nNo good? Angela's Sheehan's son? Dance, Frankie, or I'll get outa this bed an' wheel you round the house.\nMy shoe is broken, Mr. Clohessy.\nFrankie, Frankie, you're bringin' the cough on me. Will you dance for the love o' Jesus so I can remember me youth with your mother in the Wembley Hall. Take off the feckin' shoe, Frankie, an' dance.\nI have to make up dances and tunes to go with them the way I did a long time ago when I was young. I dance around the room with one shoe because I forgot to take it off. I try to make up words, Oh, The Walls of Limerick are falling down, falling down, falling down, The Walls of Limerick falling down and the River Shannon kills us.\nMr. Clohessy is laughing in the bed. Oh, Jaysus, I never heard likes o' that on land or sea. That's a great leg for the dancing you have there, Frankie. Oh, Jaysus. He coughs and brings up ropes of green and yellow stuff. It makes me sick to look at it and I wonder if I should go home from all this sickness and this bucket and let my parents kill me if they want to.\nPaddy lies down on a mattress by the window and I lie beside him. I keep my clothes on like everybody else and I even forget to take off my\nother shoe, which is wet and squishy and stinks. Paddy falls asleep right away and I look at his mother sitting by the bit of a fire smoking another cigarette. Paddy's father groans and coughs and spits into the bucket. He says, Feckin' blood, and she says, You'll have to go into the sanatorium sooner or later.\nI will not. The day they put you in there is the end of you.\nYou could be givin'the consumption to the children. I could get the guards to take you away you're that much of a danger to the children.\nIf they were to get it they'd have it be now.\nThe fire dies and Mrs. Clohessy climbs over him into the bed. In a minute she's snoring even if he's still coughing and laughing about the days of his youth when he danced with Angela Sheehan light as a feather in the Wembley Hall.\nIt's cold in the room and I'm shivering in my wet clothes. Paddy is shivering too but he's asleep and he doesn't know he's cold. I don't know if I should stay here or get up and go home but who wants to be wandering the streets when a guard might ask you what you're doing out. It's my first time away from my family and I know I'd rather be in my own house with the smelly lavatory and stable next door. It's bad when our kitchen is a lake and we have to go up to Italy but it's worse in the Clohessys' when you have to go down four flights to the lavatory and slip on shit all the way down. I'd be better off with four goats in a ditch.\nI drift in and out of sleep but I have to wake up for good when Mrs. Clohessy goes around pulling at her family to get them up. They all went to bed with their clothes on so they don't have to get dressed and there's no fighting. They grumble and run out the door to get downstairs to the backyard lavatory. I have to go too and I run down with Paddy but his sister Peggy is on the bowl and we have to piss against a wall. She says, I'll tell Ma what ye did, and Paddy says, Shurrup or I'll push you down into that feckin' lavatory. She jumps off the lavatory, pulls her drawers up and runs up the stairs crying, I'll tell, I'll tell, and when we get back to the room Mrs. Clohessy gives Paddy a belt on the head for what he did to his poor little sister. Paddy says nothing because Mrs. Clohessy is spooning porridge into mugs and jam jars and one bowl and telling us to eat up and go to school. She sits at the table eating her porridge. Her hair is gray black and dirty. It dangles in the bowl and picks up bits of porridge and drops of milk. The children slurp the porridge and complain they didn't get enough, they're starving with the hunger. They have snotty noses and sore eyes and scabby knees. Mr. Clohessy coughs and squirms on the bed and brings up the great gobs of blood and I run out of the room and puke on the stairs where there's a step missing and there's a shower of porridge and bits of apple to the floor below where people go back and forth to the lavatory in the yard. Paddy comes down and says, Sure that's all right. Everywan gets sick an' shits on them stairs an' the whole feckin' place is falling down anyway.\nI don't know what I'm supposed to do now. If I go back to school I'll be killed and why should I go back to school or go home to get killed when I can go out the road and live on milk and apples the rest of my life till I go to America. Paddy says, Come on. School is all a cod anyway an' the masters is all madmen.\nThere's a knock at the Clohessys' door and it's Mam holding my little brother, Michael, by the hand, and Guard Dennehy, who is in charge of school attendance. Mam sees me and says, What are you doing with one shoe on? and Guard Dennehy says, Ah, now, missus, I think a more\nimportant question would be, What are you doing with one shoe off, ha,\nha.\nMichael runs to me. Mammy was crying. Mammy was crying for you,\nFrankie.\nShe says, Where were you all night?\nI was here.\nYou had me demented. Your father walked every street in Limerick\nlooking for you.\nMr. Clohessy says, Who's at the door?\nIt's my mother, Mr. Clohessy.\nGod above, is that Angela?\n'Tis, Mr. Clohessy.\nHe struggles up on his elbows. Well, for the love of God, will you\ncome in, Angela. Don't you know me?\nMam looks puzzled. It's dark in the room and she tries to make out\nwho is in the bed. He says, 'Tis me, Dennis Clohessy, Angela. Ah, no.\n'Tis, Angela.\nAh, no.\nI know, Angela. I'm changed. The cough is killin' me. But I\nremember the nights at the Wembley Hall. Aw, Jaysus, you were a great dancer. Nights at the Wembley Hall, Angela, and the fish and chips after. Oh, boys, oh, boys, Angela.\nMy mother has tears running down her face. She says, You were a great dancer yourself, Dennis Clohessy.\nWe could have won competitions, Angela. Fred and Ginger would have been lookin' over their shoulders but you had to run off to America. Aw, Jaysus.\nHe has another coughing fit and we have to stand and watch him hang over the bucket again and bring up the bad stuff from his insides. Guard Dennehy says, I think, missus, we found the by an' I'll be going. He says to me, If you ever go on the mooch again, by, we'll have you in the jail above. Are you listenin' to me, by?\nI am, Guard.\nDon't be tormentin' your mother, by. That's wan thing the guards won't put up with, the tormentin' of mothers.\nI won't, Guard. I won't torment her.\nHe leaves and Mam goes to the bed to take Mr. Clohessy's hand. His face is caved in all around his eyes and his hair is shiny black with the sweat running from the top of his head. His children stand around the bed looking at him and looking at Mam. Mrs. Clohessy sits by the fire rattling the poker in the grate and pushing the baby away from the fire. She says, 'Tis his own bloody fault for not goin' into hospital, so 'tis.\nMr. Clohessy gasps, I'd be all right if I could live in a dry place. Angela, is America a dry place?\n'Tis, Dennis.\nThe doctor told me go to Arizona. A funny man that doctor. Arizona how are you. I don't have the money to go around the corner for a pint.\nMam says, You'll be all right, Dennis. I'll light a candle for you. Save your money, Angela. My dancin' days are done.\nI have to go now, Dennis. My son has to go to school.\nBefore you go, Angela, will you do one thing for me?\nI will, Dennis, if 'tis in my power.\nWould you ever give us a verse of that song you sang the night before you went to America?\nThat's a hard song, Dennis. I wouldn't have the wind for it.\nAh, come on, Angela. I never hear a song anymore. There isn't a song in this house. The wife there doesn't have a note in her head an' no step in her foot.\nMam says, All right. I'll try.\nOh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune, Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon.\nWhen the boys began to gather in the glen of a Summer night, And the Kerry piper's tuning made us long with wild delight.\nShe stops and presses her hand to her chest, Oh, God, my wind is gone. Help me, Frank, with the song, and I sing along, Oh, to think of it, Oh, to dream of it, fills my heart with tears.\nOh, the nights of the Kerry dancing, Oh, the ring of the piper's tune Oh, for one of those hours of gladness, gone, alas, like our youth too soon.\nMr. Clohessy tries to sing with us, gone, alas, like our youth too soon, but it brings on the cough. He shakes his head and cries, I wouldn't doubt you, Angela. It takes me back. God bless you.\nGod bless you, too, Dennis, and thanks, Mrs. Clohessy, for having Frankie here off the streets.\n'Twas no trouble, Mrs. McCourt. He's quiet enough.\nQuiet enough, says Mr. Clohessy, but he's not the dancer his mother\nwas.\nMam says, 'Tis hard to dance with one shoe, Dennis.\nI know, Angela, but you'd wonder why he didn't take it off. Is he a\nbit strange?\nAh, sometimes he has the odd manner like his father. Oh, yes. The\nfather is from the North, Angela, and that would account for it. They'd think nothing of dancing with one shoe in the North.\nWe walk up Patrick Street and O'Connell Street, Paddy Clohessy and Mam and Michael and myself, and Mam sobs all the way. Michael says, Don't cry, Mammy. Frankie won't run away.\nShe lifts him up and hugs him. Oh, no, Michael, 'tisn't Frankie I'm crying about. 'Tis Dennis Clohessy and the dancing nights at the Wembley Hall and the fish and chips after.\nShe comes into the school with us. Mr. O'Neill looks cross and tells us sit down he'll be with us in a minute. He talks a long time at the door with my mother and when she leaves he walks between the seats and pats Paddy Clohessy on the head.\nI'm very sorry for the Clohessys and all their troubles but I think they saved me from getting into trouble with my mother.\nVII\nThere are Thursdays when Dad gets his dole money at the Labour Exchange and a man might say, Will we go for a pint, Malachy? and Dad will say, One, only one, and the man will say, Oh, God, yes, one, and before the night is over all the money is gone and Dad comes home singing and getting us out of bed to line up and promise to die for Ireland when the\ncall comes. He even gets Michael up and he's only three but there he is singing and promising to die for Ireland at the first opportunity. That's what Dad calls it, the first opportunity. I'm nine and Malachy is eight and we know all the songs. We sing all the verses of Kevin Barry and Roddy McCorley, \"The West's Asleep, \"\n\"O'Donnell Abu, \"\n\"The Boys of Wexford. \" We sing and promise to die because you never know when Dad might have a penny or two left over from the drinking and if he gives it to us we can run to Kathleen O'Connell's next day for toffee. Some nights he says Michael is the best singer of all and he gives him the penny. Malachy and I wonder what's the use of being eight and nine and knowing all the songs and ready to die when Michael gets the penny so that he can go to the shop next day and stuff his gob with toffee galore. No one can ask him to die for Ireland at the age of three, not even Padraig Pearse, who was shot by the English in Dublin in 1916 and expected the whole world to die with him. Besides, Mikey Molloy's father said anyone who wants to die for Ireland is a donkey's arse. Men have been dying for Ireland since the beginning of time and look at the state of the country.\nIt's bad enough that Dad loses jobs in the third week but now he drinks all the dole money once a month. Mam gets desperate and in the morning she has the bitter face and she won't talk to him. He has his tea and leaves the house early for the long walk into the country. When he returns in the evening she still won't talk to him and she won't make his tea. If the fire is dead for the want of coal or turf and there's no way of boiling water for the tea, he says, Och, aye, and drinks water out of a jam jar and smacks his lips the way he would with a pint of porter. He says good water is all a man needs and Mam makes a snorting sound. When she's not talking to him the house is heavy and cold and we know we're not supposed to talk to him either for fear she'll give us the bitter look. We know Dad has done the bad thing and we know you can make anyone suffer by not talking to him. Even little Michael knows that when Dad does the bad thing you don't talk to him from Friday to Monday and when he tries to lift you to his lap you run to Mam.\nI'm nine years old and I have a pal, Mickey Spellacy, whose relations are dropping one by one of the galloping consumption. I envy Mickey because every time someone dies in his family he gets a week off from school and his mother stitches a black diamond patch on his sleeve so that he can wander from lane to lane and street to street and people will know he has the grief and pat his head and give him money and sweets for his sorrow.\nBut this summer Mickey is worried. His sister, Brenda, is wasting away with the consumption and it's only August and if she dies before September he won't get his week off from school because you can't get a week off from school when there's no school. He comes to Billy Campbell and me to ask if we'll go around the corner to St. Joseph's Church and pray for Brenda to hang on till September.\nWhat's in it for us, Mickey, if we go around the corner praying?\nWell, if Brenda hangs on and I get me week off ye can come to the wake and have ham and cheese and cake and sherry and lemonade and everything and ye can listen to the songs and stories all night.\nWho could say no to that? There's nothing like a wake for having a good time. We trot around to the church where they have statues of St. Joseph himself as well as the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and\nSt. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux, the Little Flower. I pray to the Little Flower because she died of the consumption herself and she'd understand.\nOne of our prayers must have been powerful because Brenda stays alive and doesn't die till the second day of school. We tell Mickey we're sorry for his troubles but he's delighted with his week off and he gets the black diamond patch which will bring the money and sweets.\nMy mouth is watering at the thought of the feast at Brenda's wake. Billy knocks on the door and there's Mickey's aunt. Well?\nWe came to say a prayer for Brenda and Mickey said we could come to the wake.\nShe yells, Mickey! What? Come here. Did you tell this gang they could come to your sister's wake?\nNo.\nBut, Mickey, you promised...\nShe slams the door in our faces. We don't know what to do till\nBilly Campbell says, We'll go back to St. Joseph's and pray that from now on everyone in Mickey Spellacy's family will die in the middle of the summer and he'll never get a day off from school for the rest of his life.\nOne of our prayers is surely powerful because next summer Mickey himself is carried off by the galloping consumption and he doesn't get a day off from school and that will surely teach him a lesson.\nProddy Woddy ring the bell,\nNot for heaven but for hell.\nOn Sunday mornings in Limerick I watch them go to church, the Protestants, and I feel sorry for them, especially the girls, who are so lovely, they have such beautiful white teeth. I feel sorry for the beautiful Protestant girls, they're doomed. That's what the priests tell us. Outside the Catholic Church there is no salvation. Outside the Catholic Church there is nothing but doom. And I want to save them. Protestant girl, come with me to the True Church. You'll be saved and you won't have the doom. After Mass on Sunday I go with my friend Billy Campbell to watch them play croquet on the lovely lawn beside their church on Barrington Street. Croquet is a Protestant game. They hit the ball with the mallet, pock and pock again, and laugh. I wonder how they can laugh or don't they even know they're doomed? I feel sorry for them and I say, Billy, what's the use of playing croquet when you're doomed?\nHe says, Frankie, what's the use of not playing croquet when you're doomed?\nGrandma says to Mam, Your brother Pat, bad leg an' all, was selling papers all over Limerick by the time he was eight and that Frank of yours is big and ugly enough to work.\nBut he's only nine and still in school.\nSchool. 'Tis school that has him the way he is talkin' back an' goin' around with the sour puss an' the odd manner like his father. He could get out an' help poor Pat of a Friday night when the Limerick Leader is a ton weight. He could run up the long garden paths of the quality an' save Pat's poor legs an' earn a few pennies into the bargain.\nHe has to go to the Confraternity on Friday nights.\nNever mind the Confraternity. There's nothin' in the catechism about confraternities.\nI meet Uncle Pat at the Limerick Leader on Friday evening at five. The man handing out the papers says my arms are that skinny I'd be lucky to carry two stamps but Uncle Pat sticks eight papers under each arm. He tells me, I'll kill you if you drop 'em for 'tis raining abroad, pelting out of the heavens. He tells me hug the walls going up O'Connell Street to keep the papers dry. I'm to run in where there's a delivery, climb the outside steps, in the door, up the stairs, yell Paper, get the money they owe him for the week, down the stairs, give him the money and on to the next stop. Customers give him tips for his troubles and he keeps them for himself.\nWe make our way up O'Connell Avenue, out Ballinacurra, in by the South Circular Road, down Henry Street and back to the office for more papers. Uncle Pat wears a cap and a thing like a cowboy poncho to keep his papers dry but he complains his feet are killing him and we stop in a pub for a pint for his poor feet. Uncle Pa Keating is there all black and having a pint and he says to Uncle Pat, Ab, are you going to let that boy stand there with his face hanging out for the want of a lemonade?\nUncle Pat says, Wha? and Uncle Pa Keating gets impatient. Christ, he's dragging your feckin' papers all over Limerick and you can't-Oh, never mind. Timmy, give the child a lemonade. Frankie, don't you have a raincoat at home?\nNo, Uncle Pa.\nYou're not supposed to be out in this weather. You're drenched entirely. Who sent you out in this muck?\nGrandma said I had to help Uncle Pat because of his bad leg. Course she did, the oul' bitch, but don't tell them I said that. Uncle Pat is struggling off the seat and gathering up his papers.\nCome on, 'tis gettin' dark.\nHe hobbles along the streets calling, Anna Lie Sweets Lie, which\ndoesn't sound a bit like Limerick Leader and it doesn't matter because everyone knows this is Ab Sheehan that was dropped on his head. Here, Ab, give us a Leader, how's your poor leg, keep the change an' get yourself a fag for 'tis an awful feckin' night to be out sellin' the feckin' papers.\nTanks, says Ab, my uncle. Tanks, tanks, tanks, and it's hard to keep up with him on the streets bad as his leg is. He says, How many Leaders have you under your oxter?\nOne, Uncle Pat.\nTake that Leader in to Mr. Timoney. He owes me for a fortnight now. Get that money an' there's a tip. He's a good man for the tip an' don't be shovin' it in your pocket like your cousin Gerry. Shoved it in his pocket, the little bugger.\nI bang on the door with the knocker and there's a great howl from a dog so big he makes the door shake. A man's voice says, Macushla, quit the bloody racket or I'll give you a good fong in the arse for yourself. The racket stops, the door opens and the man is there, white hair, thick glasses, white sweater, a stick in his hand. He says, Who is it? Who do we have?\nThe paper, Mr. Timoney.\nWe don't have Ab Sheehan here, do we?\nI'm his nephew, sir.\nIs it Gerry Sheehan we have here?\nNo, sir. I'm Frank McCourt.\nAnother nephew? Does he make them? Is there a little nephew factory\nin the backyard? Here's the money for the fortnight and give me the paper\nor keep it. What's the use? I can't read anymore and Mrs. Minihan that's supposed to read to me didn't come. Legless with the sherry, that's what she is. What's your name?\nFrank, sir.\nCan you read?\nI can, sir.\nDo you want to earn a sixpence?\nI do, sir.\nCome here tomorrow. Your name is Francis, isn't it? Frank, sir.\nYour name is Francis. There was never a St. Frank. That's a name for gangsters and politicians. Come here tomorrow at eleven and read to me.\nI will, sir.\nAre you sure you can read?\nI am, sir.\nYou can call me Mr. Timoney.\nI will, Mr. Timoney.\nUncle Pat is mumbling at the gate, rubbing his leg. Where's me\nmoney an' you're not supposed to be chattin' with the customers an' me here with the leg destroyed be the rain. He has to stop at the pub at Punch's Cross to have a pint for the destroyed leg. After the pint he says he can't walk another inch and we get on a bus. The conductor says, Fares, please, fares, but Uncle Pat says, Go 'way an' don't be botherin' me, can't you see the state o' me leg?\nOh, all right, Ab, all right.\nThe bus stops at the O'Connell Monument and Uncle Pat goes to the Monument Fish and Chip Caf\u00e9 where the smells are so delicious my stomach beats with the hunger. He gets a shilling's worth of fish and chips and my mouth is watering but when we get to Grandma's door he gives me a threepenny bit, tells me meet him again next Friday and go home now to my mother.\nThe dog Macushla is lying outside Mr. Timoney's door and when I open the little garden gate to go up the path she rushes at me and knocks me back out on the pavement and she'd eat my face if Mr. Timoney didn't come out and flail at her with his stick and yell, Come in out of it, ye hoor, ye overgrown man eatin' bitch. Didn't you have your breakfast, you hoor? Are you all right, Francis? Come in. That dog is a right Hindu, so she is, and that's where I found her mother wandering around Bangalore. If ever you're getting a dog, Francis, make sure it's a Buddhist. Good natured dogs, the Buddhists. Never, never get a Mahommedan. They'll eat you sleeping. Never a Catholic dog. They'll eat you every day including Fridays. Sit down and read to me.\nThe Limerick Leader, Mr. Timoney?\nNo, not the bloody Limerick Leader. I wouldn't wipe the hole of my arse with the Limerick Leader. There's a book over there on the table, Gulliver's Travels. That's not what I want you to read. Look in the back for another thing, A Modest Proposal. Read that to me. It begins, It is a melancholy object to those who walk... Do you have that? I have the whole bloody thing in my head but I still want you to read to me.\nHe stops me after two or three pages. You're a good reader. And what do you think of that, Francis, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled, eh? Macushla would love a dinner of a nice plump Irish infant, wouldn't you, you oul' hoor?\nHe gives me sixpence, and tells me return next Saturday.\nMam is delighted I earned sixpence for reading to Mr. Timoney and what was it he wanted read, the Limerick Leader? I tell her I had to read A Modest Proposal from the back of Gulliver's Travels and she says, That's all right, 'tis only a children's book. You'd expect him to want something strange for he's a little off in the head after years in the sun in the English army in India and they say he was married to one of them Indian women and she was accidentally shot by a soldier during some class of a disturbance. That's the kind of thing that would drive you to children's books. She knows this Mrs. Minihan who lives next door to Mr. Timoney and used to clean house but couldn't stand it anymore the way he laughed at the Catholic Church and said one man's sin was another man's romp. Mrs. Minihan didn't mind the odd drop of sherry of a Saturday morning but then he tried to turn her into a Buddhist, which he said he was himself and the Irish would be much better off in general if they sat under a tree and watched the Ten Commandments and the Seven Deadly Sins float down the Shannon and far out to sea.\nThe next Friday Declan Collopy from the Confraternity sees me on the street delivering the papers with my uncle Pat Sheehan. Hoi, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' with Ab Sheehan?\nHe's my uncle.\nYou're supposed to be at the Confraternity.\nI'm working, Declan.\nYou're not supposed to be working. You're not even ten and you're\ndestroyin' the perfect attendance in our section. If you're not there next Friday I'll give you a good thump in the gob, do you hear me?\nUncle Pat says, Go 'way, go 'way, or I'll walk on you.\nAh, shut up, Mr. Stupid that was dropped on your head. He pushes Uncle Pat on the shoulder and knocks him back against the wall. I drop the papers and run at him but he steps aside and punches me on the back of the neck and my forehead is rammed into the wall and it puts me in such a rage I can't see him anymore. I go at him with arms and legs and if I could tear his face off with my teeth I would but he has long arms like a gorilla and he just keeps pushing me away so that I can't touch him. He says, You mad feckin' eejit. I'll destroy you in the Confraternity, and he runs away.\nUncle Pat says, You shouldn't be fightin' like that an' you dropped all me papers an' some o' them is wet an' how am I supposed to sell wet papers, and I wanted to jump on him too and hit him for talking about papers after I stood up to Declan Collopy.\nAt the end of the night he gives me three chips from his bag and sixpence instead of threepence. He complains it's too much money and it's all my mother's fault for going on to Grandma about the low pay.\nMam is delighted I'm getting sixpence on Fridays from Uncle Pat and sixpence on Saturdays from Mr. Timoney. A shilling a week makes a big difference and she gives me tuppence to see the Dead End Kids at the Lyric after I'm finished the reading.\nNext morning Mr. Timoney says, Wait till we get to Gulliver, Francis. You'll know Jonathan Swift is the greatest Irish writer that ever lived, no, the greatest man to put pen to parchment. A giant of a man, Francis. He laughs all through A Modest Proposal and you'd wonder what he's laughing at when it's all about cooking Irish babies. He says, You'll laugh when you grow up, Francis.\nYou're not supposed to talk back to grown-ups but Mr. Timoney is different and he doesn't mind when I say, Mr. Timoney, big people are\nalways telling us that. Oh, you'll laugh when you grow up. You'll understand when you grow up. Everything will come when you grow up.\nHe lets out such a roar of a laugh I think he's going to collapse. Oh, Mother o' God, Francis. You're a treasure. What's up with you? Do you have a bee up your arse? Tell me what's up.\nNothing, Mr. Timoney.\nI think you have the long puss, Francis, and I wish I could Go over to the mirror on the wall, Snow White, and tell me if you the long puss. Never mind. Just tell me what's up.\nDeclan Collopy was at me last night and I got into a fight.\nHe makes me tell him about the Confraternity and Declan and\nuncle Pat Sheehan, who was dropped on his head, and then he tells\nknows my uncle Pa Keating, who was gassed in the war and works in\nworks. He says, Pa Keating is a jewel of a man. And I'll tell you\nI'll do, Francis. I'll talk to Pa Keating and we'll go to the crawthumpers at the Confraternity. I'm a Buddhist myself and I don't hold with fighting but I haven't lost it. They're not going to interfere with my little reader, oh, by Jesus, no.\nMr. Timoney is an old man but he talks like a friend and I can say what I feel. Dad would never talk to me like Mr. Timoney. He'd say, Och, aye, and go for a long walk.\nUncle Pat Sheehan tells Grandma he doesn't want me to help with the papers anymore, he can get another boy much cheaper and he thinks I should be giving him some of my Saturday morning sixpence anyway since I'd never have the reading job without him.\nA woman next door to Mr. Timoney tells me I'm wasting my time knocking on the door, Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun on the same day and Mr. Timoney couldn't stop laughing though he cried when the dog was taken away to be put down. You can bite postmen and milkmen all you like but the case of the passing nun goes all the way to the bishop and he takes steps especially if the owner of the dog is a known Buddhist and a danger to good Catholics around him. Mr. Timoney was told this and cried and laughed so hard the doctor came and said he was gone beyond recall so they carted him off to the City Home, where they keep old people who are helpless or demented.\nThat's the end of my Saturday sixpence but I'll read to Mr. Timoney money or no money. I wait down the street till the woman next door goes in, I climb in Mr. Timoney's window for Gulliver'sTravels and walk miles to the City Home so that he won't miss his reading. The man at the gate says, What? You want to come in an' read to an oul' man? Is it coddin' me you are? Get outa here before I call the guards.\nCould I leave the book for someone else to read to Mr. Timoney? Leave it. Leave it for Jaysus sake an' don't be botherin' me. I'll send it up to him.\nAnd he laughs.\nMam says, What's up with you? Why are you moping? And I tell her how Uncle Pat doesn't want me anymore and how they put Mr. Timoney in the City Home for laughing just because Macushla bit the postman, the milkman and a passing nun. She laughs too and I'm sure the world is gone mad. Then she says, Ah, I'm sorry and it's a pity you lost two jobs. You might as well start going to the Confraternity again to keep The Posse away and, worse, the director, Father Gorey.\nDeclan tells me sit in front of him and if there's any blaguarding he'll break my feckin' neck for he'll be watching me as long as he's\nsee it. have\nmy\nme he\nthe gas\nwhat\nprefect and no little shit like me is going to keep him from a life in linoleum.\nMam says she has trouble climbing the stairs and she's moving her bed to the kitchen. She laughs, I'll come back up to Sorrento when the walls are damp and the rain runs under the door. School is over and she can stay in bed in the kitchen as long as she likes because she doesn't have to get up for us. Dad lights the fire, makes the tea, cuts the bread, makes sure we wash our faces and tells us go out and play. He lets us stay in bed if we like but you never want to stay in bed when there's no school. We're ready to run out and play in the lane the minute we wake.\nThen one day in July he says we can't go downstairs. We have to stay up here and play.\nWhy, Dad?\nNever mind. Play here with Malachy and Michael and you can go down later when I tell you.\nHe stands at the door in case we might get a notion to wander down the stairs. We push our blanket up in the air with our feet and pretend we're in a tent, Robin Hood and his Merry Men. We hunt fleas and squash them between our thumbnails.\nThen there's a baby's cry and Malachy says, Dad, did Mam get a new\nbaby?\nOch, aye, son.\nI'm older so I tell Malachy the bed is in the kitchen so that the angel can fly down and leave the baby on the seventh step but Malachy doesn't understand because he's only eight going on nine and I'll be ten next month.\nMam is in the bed with the new baby. He has a big fat face and he's red all over. There's a woman in the kitchen in a nurse's uniform and we know she's there to wash new babies who are always dirty from the long journey with the angel. We want to tickle the baby but she says, No, no, ye can look at him but don't lay a finger.\nDon't lay a finger. That's the way nurses talk.\nWe sit at the table with our tea and bread looking at our new brother but he won't even open his eyes to look back at us so we go out and play.\nIn a few days Mam is out of the bed holding the baby on her lap by the fire. His eyes are open and when we tickle him he makes a gurgling sound, his belly shakes and that makes us laugh. Dad tickles him and sings a Scottish song, Oh, oh, stop your ticklin', Jock, Stop your ticklin', Jock.\nStop your ticklin',\nIckle ickle icklin\nStop your ticklin', Jock.\nDad has a job so Bridey Hannon is able to visit Mam and the baby any time she likes and for once Mam doesn't tell us go out and play so they can talk about secret things. They sit by the fire smoking and talking about names. Mam says she likes the names Kevin and Sean but Bridey says, Ah, no, there's too many of them in Limerick. Jesus, Angela, if you stuck your head out the door and called, Kevin or Sean, come in for your tea, you'd have half o' Limerick running to your door.\nBridey says if she had a son which please God she will some day she'll call him Ronald because she's mad about Ronald Colman that you see in the Coliseum Cinema. Or Errol, now that's another lovely name, Errol Flynn.\nMam says, Will you go way outa that, Bridey. I'd never be able to stick my head out the door and say, Errol, Errol, come in for your tea. Sure the poor child would be a laughingstock.\nRonald, says Bridey, Ronald. He's gorgeous.\nNo, says Mam, it has to be Irish. Isn't that what we fought for all these years? What's the use of fighting the English for centuries if we're going to call our children Ronald?\nJesus, Angela, you're starting to talk like himself with his Irish this and his English that.\nStill an' all, Bridey, he's right.\nSuddenly Bridey is gasping, Jesus, Angela, there's something wrong with that child. Mam is out of the chair, hugging the child, moaning. Oh, Jesus, Bridey, he's choking.\nBridey says, I'll run for my mother, and she's back in a minute with Mrs. Hannon. Castor oil, says Mrs. Hannon. Do you have it? Any oil. Cod liver oil? That'll do.\nShe pours the oil into the baby's mouth, turns him over, presses on his back, turns him back over, sticks a spoon down his throat and brings up a white ball. That's it now, she says. The milk. It collects and gets hard in their little throats so you have to ease it with any class of an oil.\nMam is crying, Jesus, I nearly lost him. Oh, I'd die so I would.\nShe's clutching the baby and crying and trying to thank Mrs. Hannon.\nYerra, don't mention it, missus. Take the child and get back into that bed for the two o' ye had a great shock.\nWhile Bridey and Mrs. Hannon are helping Mam to the bed I notice spots of blood on her chair. Is my mother bleeding to death? Is it all right to say, Look, there's blood on Mam's chair? No, you can't say anything because they always have secrets. I know if you say anything the grown-up people will tell you, Never mind, you're always gawking, none of your business, go out and play.\nI have to keep it inside or I can talk to the angel. Mrs. Hannon and Bridey leave and I sit on the seventh step. I try to tell the angel Mam is bleeding to death. I want him to tell me, Fear not, but the step is cold and there's no light, no voice. I'm sure he's gone forever and I wonder if that happens when you go from nine to ten.\nMam doesn't bleed to death. She's out of the bed next day getting the baby ready for baptism, telling Bridey she could never forgive herself if the baby died and went to Limbo, a place for unbaptized babies, where it may be nice and warm but, still, dark forever and no hope of escape even on the Judgment Day.\nGrandma is there to help and she says, That's right, no hope in heaven for the infant that's not baptized.\nBridey says it would be a hard God that would do the likes of that.\nHe has to be hard, says Grandma, otherwise you'd have all kinds of babies clamorin' to get into heaven, Protestants an' everything, an' why should they get in after what they did to us for eight hundred years?\nThe babies didn't do it, says Bridey. They're too small.\nThey would if they got the chance, says Grandma. They're trained for it.\nThey dress the baby in the Limerick lace dress we were all baptized in. Mam says we can all go to St. Joseph's and we're excited because there will be lemonade and buns after.\nMalachy says, Mam, what's the baby's name?\nAlphonsus Joseph.\nThe words fly out of my mouth, That's a stupid name. It's not even\nIrish.\nGrandma glares at me with her old red eyes. She says, That fella\nneeds a good clitther on the gob. Mam slaps me across the face and sends me flying across the kitchen. My heart is pounding and I want to cry but I can't because my father isn't there and I'm the man of the family. Mam says, You go upstairs with your big mouth and don't move from that room.\nI stop at the seventh step but it's still cold, no light, no voice.\nThe house is quiet with everyone gone to the chapel. I sit and wait upstairs, knocking the fleas off my arms and legs, wishing I had Dad here, thinking of my little brother and his foreign name, Alphonsus, an affliction of a name.\nIn awhile there are voices downstairs and there is talk of tea, sherry, lemonade, buns, and isn't that child the loveliest little fella in the world, little Alphie, foreign name but still an' all still an' all not a sound outa him the whole time he's that good-natured God bless him sure he'll live forever with the sweetness that's in him the little dote spittin' image of his mother his father his grandma his little brothers dead an' gone.\nMam calls from the bottom of the stairs, Frank, come down and have lemonade and a bun.\nI don't want it. You can keep it.\nI said come down this minute for if I have to climb these stairs I'll warm your behind and you'll rue the day.\nRue? What's rue?\nNever mind what's rue. Come down here at once.\nHer voice is sharp and rue sounds dangerous. I'll go down.\nIn the kitchen Grandma says, Look at the long puss on him. You'd\nthink he'd be happy for his little brother except that a boy that's going from nine to ten is always a right pain in the arse an' I know for didn't I have two of 'em.\nThe lemonade and bun are delicious and Alphie the new baby is chirping away enjoying his baptism day too innocent to know his name is an affliction.\nGrandpa in the North sends a telegram money order for five pounds for the baby Alphie. Mam wants to cash it but she can't go far from the bed. Dad says he'll cash it at the post office. She tells Malachy and me to go with him. He cashes it and tells us, All right, boys, go home and tell your mother I'll be home in a few minutes.\nMalachy says, Dad, you're not to go to the pub. Mam said you're to bring home the money. You're not to drink the pint.\nNow, now, son. Go home to your mother. Dad, give us the money. That money is for the baby.\nNow, Francis, don't be a bad boy. Do what your father tells you.\nHe walks away from us and into South's pub. Mam is sitting by the fireplace with Alphie in her arms. She shakes her head. He went to the pub, didn't he? He did. I want ye to go back down to that pub and read\nhim out of it. I want ye to stand in the middle of the pub and tell every man your father is drinking the money for the baby. Ye are to tell the world there isn't a scrap of food in this house, not a lump of coal to start the fire, not a drop of milk for the baby's bottle.\nWe walk through the streets and Malachy practices his speech at the top of his voice, Dad, Dad, that five pounds is for the new baby. That's not for the drink. The child is above in the bed bawling and roaring for his milk and you're drinking the pint.\nHe's gone from South's pub. Malachy still wants to stand and make his speech but I tell him we have to hurry and look in other pubs before Dad drinks the whole five pounds. We can't find him in other pubs either. He knows Mam would come for him or send us and there are so many pubs at this end of Limerick and beyond we could be looking for a month. We have to tell Mam there's no sign of him and she tells us we're pure useless. Oh, Jesus, I wish I had my strength and I'd search every pub in Limerick. I'd tear the mouth out of his head, so I would. Go on, go back down and try all the pubs around the railway station and try Naughton's fish and chip shop.\nI have to go by myself because Malachy has the runs and can't stray far from the bucket. I search all the pubs on Parnell Street and around. I look into the snugs where the women drink and in all the men's lavatories. I'm hungry but I'm afraid to go home till I find my father. He's not in Naughton's fish and chip shop but there's a drunken man asleep at a table in the corner and his fish and chips are on the floor in their Limerick Leader wrapping and if I don't get them the cat will so I shove them under my jersey and I'm out the door and up the street to sit on the steps at the railway station eat my fish and chips watch the drunken soldiers pass by with the girls that giggle thank the drunken man in my mind for drowning the fish and chips in vinegar and smothering them in salt and then remember that if I die tonight I'm in a state of sin for stealing and I could go straight to hell stuffed with fish and chips but it's Saturday and if the priests are still in the confession boxes I can clear my soul after my feed.\nThe Dominican church is just up Glentworth Street.\nBless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession. I tell him the usual sins and then, I stole fish and chips from a drunken man.\nWhy, my child?\nI was hungry, Father.\nAnd why were you hungry?\nThere was nothing in my belly, Father.\nHe says nothing and even though it's dark I know he's shaking his\nhead. My dear child, why can't you go home and ask your mother for something? Because she sent me out looking for my father in the pubs, Father, and I couldn't find him and she hasn't a scrap in the house because he's drinking the five pounds Grandpa sent from the North for the new baby and she's raging by the fire because I can't find my father.\nI wonder if this priest is asleep because he's very quiet till he says, My child, I sit here. I hear the sins of the poor. I assign the penance. I bestow absolution. I should be on my knees washing their feet. Do you understand me, my child?\nI tell him I do but I don't.\nGo home, child. Pray for me.\nNo penance, Father?\nNo, my child.\nI stole the fish and chips. I'm doomed.\nYou're forgiven. Go. Pray for me. He blesses me in Latin, talks to\nhimself in English and I wonder what I did to him. I wish I could find my father so I could say to Mam, Here he is and he has three pounds left in his pocket. I'm not hungry now so I can go up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and search pubs on the side streets and there he is in Gleeson's, how could I miss him with his singing, 'Tis alone my concern if the grandest surprise Would be shining at me out of somebody's eyes.\n'Tis my private affair what my feelings would be While the Green Glens of Antrim were welcoming me.\nMy heart is banging away in my chest and I don't know what to do because I know I'm raging inside like my mother by the fire and all I can think of doing is running in and giving him a good kick in the leg and running out again but I don't because we have the mornings by the fire when he tells me about Cuchulain and De Valera and Roosevelt and if he's there drunk and buying pints with the baby's money he has that look in his eyes Eugene had when he searched for Oliver and I might as well go home and tell my mother a lie that I never saw him couldn't find him.\nShe's in the bed with the baby. Malachy and Michael are up in Italy asleep. I know I don't have to tell Mam anything, that soon when the pubs close he'll be home singing and offering us a penny to die for Ireland and it will be different now because it's bad enough to drink the dole or the wages but a man that drinks the money for a new baby is gone beyond the beyonds as my mother would say.\nVIII\nI'm ten years old and ready to go to St. Joseph's Church for my Confirmation. In school the master, Mr. O'Dea, prepares us. We have to know all about Sanctifying Grace, a pearl of great price, bought for us by Jesus in His dying. Mr. O'Dea's eyes roll in his head when he tells us that with Confirmation we will become part of Divinity. We will have the Gifts of the Holy Ghost: Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Fortitude, Knowledge, Piety, the Fear of the Lord. Priests and masters tell us Confirmation means you're a true soldier of the Church and that entitles you to die and be a martyr in case we're invaded by Protestants or Mahommedans or any other class of a heathen. More dying. I want to tell them I won't be able to die for the Faith because I'm already booked to die for Ireland.\nMikey Molloy says, Is it jokin' you are? That thing about dying for the Faith is all a cod. 'Tis only a saying they made up to frighten you. Ireland too. No one dies for anything anymore. All the dying is done. I wouldn't die for Ireland or the Faith. I might die for my mother but that's all.\nMikey knows everything. He's going on fourteen. He gets the fits. He has visions.\nThe grown-ups tell us it's a glorious thing to die for the Faith, only we're not ready for that yet because Confirmation day is like First Communion day, you make the rounds of lanes and back streets and you get cakes and sweets and money, The Collection.\nThat's where poor Peter Dooley comes in. We call him Quasimodo because he has a hump on his back like the one on the hunchback of Notre Dame, whose real name we know is Charles Laughton.\nQuasimodo has nine sisters and it is said his mother never wanted him but that was what the angel brought her and it's a sin to question what's sent. Quasimodo is old, he's fifteen. His red hair sticks up in all directions. He has green eyes and one rolls around in his head so much he's constantly tapping his temple to keep it where it's supposed to be. His right leg is short and twisted and when he walks he does a little twirly dance and you never know when he'll fall. That's when you're surprised. He curses his leg, he curses the world, but he curses in a lovely English accent which he got from the radio, the BBC. Before he leaves his house he always sticks his head out the door and tells the lane, Here's me head, me arse is coming. When he was twelve Quasimodo decided that with the way he looked and the way the world looked at him the best thing would be to prepare for a job where he could be heard and not seen and what better than sitting behind a microphone at the BBC in London reading the news?\nBut you can't get to London without money and that's why he hobbles up to us that Friday, the day before Confirmation. He has an idea for Billy and me. He knows the next day we'll be getting Confirmation money and if we promise to pay him a shilling each he'll let us climb up the rainspout behind his house this very night to look in the window and see his sisters' naked bodies when they take their weekly wash. I sign right away. Billy says, I have my own sister. Why should I pay to see your naked sisters?\nQuasimodo says that looking at your own sister's naked body is the worst sin of all and he's not sure if there's a priest in the world can forgive you, that you might have to go to the bishop, who everyone knows is a holy terror.\nBilly signs.\nFriday night we climb the wall of Quasimodo's backyard. It's a lovely night with the June moon floating high over Limerick and you can feel a warm breeze off the Shannon River. Quasimodo is about to let Billy up the spout and who comes clambering over the wall but Mikey Molloy the Fit himself hissing at Quasimodo, Here's a shilling, Quasimodo. Let me up the spout. Mikey is fourteen now, bigger than any of us and strong from his job delivering coal. He's black from the coal like Uncle Pa Keating and all you can see are the whites of his eyes and the white froth on his lower lip, which means he could have the fit anytime.\nQuasimodo says, Wait, Mikey. They're first. Wait, my arse, says Mikey, and he's away up the spout. Billy complains but Quasimodo shakes his head, I can't help it. He comes every week with the shilling. I have to let him up the spout or he'll beat me up and tell my mother and the next thing she locks me in the coal hole all day with the rats. The Fit is up hanging on to the spout with one hand. The other hand is in his pocket moving, moving and when the spout itself starts to move and creak Quasimodo hisses, Molloy, there's to be no whankin' up the spout. He hops around the yard cackling. His BBC accent is gone and he's pure Limerick. Jaysus, Molloy, come down off that spout or I'll tell me mother. Mikey's hand goes faster in his pocket, so fast the spout gives a lurch and collapses and Mikey is rolling on the ground yelping, I'm dead. I'm destroyed. Oh, God. You can see the froth on his lips and the blood that comes from biting his tongue.\nQuasimodo's mother comes screaming through the door, What in the name of Jesus! and the kitchen light fills the yard. The sisters are squawking from the window above. Billy tries to escape and she drags him off the wall. She tells him run to O'Connor the chemist around the corner to ring up an ambulance or a doctor or something for Mikey. She screams at us to get into the kitchen. She kicks Quasimodo into the hall. He's on his hands and knees and she drags him to the coal hole under the stairs and locks him in. Stay there till you come to your senses.\nHe's crying and calling to her in a pure Limerick accent. Ah, Mamma, Mamma, let me out. The rats is here. I only want to go to the BBC, Mamma. Aw, Jasus, Mamma, Jasus. I'll never let anyone up the spout again. I'll send money from London, Mamma. Mamma!\nMikey is still on his back, jerking and twisting around the yard. The ambulance takes him off to the hospital with a broken shoulder and his tongue in ribbons.\nOur mothers are there in no time. Mrs. Dooley says, I'm disgraced, so I am, disgraced. My daughters can't wash theirselves of a Friday night without the whole world gawking in the window and them boys there are in a state of sin and should be taken to the priest for confession before their Confirmation tomorrow.\nBut Mam says, I don't know about the rest of the world but I saved a whole year for Frank's Confirmation suit and I'm not going to the priest to have him tell me my son is not fit for Confirmation so that I'll have to wait another year when he grows out of this suit and all because he climbed a spout for an innocent gawk at the scrawny arse of Mona Dooley.\nShe drags me home by the ear and makes me kneel before the Pope. Swear, she says, swear to that Pope that you didn't look at Mona Dooley in her pelt.\nI swear.\nIf you're lying you won't be in a state of grace for Confirmation tomorrow and that's the worst kind of sacrilege.\nI swear.\nOnly the bishop himself could forgive a sacrilege like that.\nI swear.\nAll right. Go to bed and from this day out stay far away from that\nmisfortunate Quasimodo Dooley.\nWe are all confirmed the next day. The bishop asks me a catechism\nquestion, What is the Fourth Commandment? and I tell him, Honor thy father and thy mother. He pats my cheek and that makes me a soldier of the True Church. I kneel in the pew and think of Quasimodo locked in the coal hole under the stairs and I wonder, Should I give him the shilling anyway for his career at the BBC?\nBut I forget all about Quasimodo because my nose starts bleeding and I feel dizzy. Confirmation boys and girls are outside St. Joseph's with their parents and there is hugging and kissing in the bright sun and I don't care. My father is working and I don't care. My mother kisses me and I don't care. The boys talk about The Collection and I don't care. My nose won't stop and Mam is worried I'll ruin my suit. She runs into the church to see if Stephen Carey, the sacristan, would spare her a rag and he gives her some kind of canvas cloth that makes my nose sore. She says, Do you want to make your collection? and I tell her I don't care. Malachy says, Do, do, Frankie, and he's sad because I promised I'd take him to the Lyric Cinema to see the film and stuff ourselves with sweets. I want\nto lie down. I could lie down there on the steps of St. Joseph's and sleep forever. Mam says, Grandma is making a nice breakfast, and the mention of food makes me so sick I run to the edge of the pavement to throw up and the whole world is looking at me and I don't care. Mam says she'd better take me home and put me to bed and my pals look surprised that anyone can go to bed when there's a collection to be made.\nShe helps me take off my Confirmation suit and puts me to bed. She wets a rag and places it under my neck and after awhile the bleeding stops. She brings tea but the look of it makes me sick and I have to throw up in the bucket. Mrs. Hannon comes in from next door and I can hear her say that's a very sick child and he should have a doctor. Mam says it's Saturday, the Dispensary is closed and where would you get a doctor?\nDad comes home from his job at Rank's Flour Mills and tells Mam I'm going through a stage, growing pains. Grandma comes up and says the same thing. She says when boys go from the one number year, which is nine, to the two number year, which is ten, they're changing and prone to the nosebleed. She says I might have too much blood in me anyway and a good cleaning out wouldn't do me one bit of harm.\nThe day passes and I'm in and out of sleep. Malachy and Michael come into the bed at night and I can hear Malachy say, Frankie is very hot. Michael says, He's bleeding on my leg. Mam puts the wet rag on my nose and a key on my neck but it won't stop the bleeding. On Sunday morning there's blood on my chest and all around me. Mam tells Dad I'm bleeding through my bottom and he says I might have a case of the runs, which is common with the growing pains.\nDr. Troy is our doctor but he's away on holiday and the man that comes to see me on Monday has a smell of whiskey on him. He examines me and tells my mother I have a bad cold and keep me in bed. Days pass and I sleep and bleed. Mam makes tea and beef tea and I don't want it. She even brings ice cream and the look of it makes me sick. Mrs. Hannon comes in again and says that doctor doesn't know what he's talking about, see if Dr. Troy is back.\nMam comes with Dr. Troy. He feels my forehead, rolls up my eyelids, turns me over to see my back, picks me up and runs to his motor car. Mam runs after him and he tells her I have typhoid fever. Mam cries, Oh, God, oh, God, am I to lose the whole family? Will it ever end? She gets into the car, holds me in her lap and moans all the way to the Fever Hospital at the City Home.\nThe bed has cool white sheets. The nurses have clean white uniforms and the nun, Sister Rita, is all in white. Dr. Humphrey and Dr. Campbell have white coats and things hanging from their necks which they stick against my chest and all over. I sleep and sleep but I'm awake when they bring in jars of bright red stuff that hang from tall poles above my bed and they stick tubes into my ankles and the back of my right hand. Sister Rita says, You're getting blood, Francis. Soldier's blood from the Sarsfield Barracks.\nMam is sitting by the bed and the nurse is saying, You know, missus, this is very unusual. No one is ever allowed into the Fever Hospital for fear they'd catch something but they made an exception for you with his crisis coming. If he gets over this he'll surely recover.\nI fall asleep. Mam is gone when I wake but there's movement in the room and it's the priest, Father Gorey, from the Confraternity saying Mass at a table in the corner. I drift off again and now they're waking\nme and pulling down the bedclothes. Father Gorey is touching me with oil and praying in Latin. I know it's Extreme Unction and that means I'm going to die and I don't care. They wake me again to receive Communion. I don't want it, I'm afraid I might get sick. I keep the wafer on my tongue and fall asleep and when I wake up again it's gone.\nIt's dark and Dr. Campbell is sitting by my bed. He's holding my wrist and looking at his watch. He has red hair and glasses and he always smiles when he talks to me. He sits now and hums and looks out the window. His eyes close and he snores a little. He tilts over on the chair and farts and smiles to himself and I know now I'm going to get better because a doctor would never fart in the presence of a dying boy.\nSister Rita's white habit is bright in the sun that comes in the window. She's holding my wrist, looking at her watch, smiling. Oh, she says, we're awake, are we? Well, Francis, I think we've come through the worst. Our prayers are answered and all the prayers of those hundreds of little boys at the Confraternity. Can you imagine that? Hundreds of boys saying the rosary for you and offering up their communion.\nMy ankles and the back of my hand are throbbing from the tubes bringing in the blood and I don't care about boys praying for me. I can hear the swish of Sister Rita's habit and the click of her rosary beads when she leaves the room. I fall asleep and when I wake it's dark and Dad is sitting by the bed with his hand on mine.\nSon, are you awake?\nI try to talk but I'm dry, nothing will come out and I point to my mouth. He holds a glass of water to my lips and it's sweet and cool. He presses my hand and says I'm a great old soldier and why wouldn't I? Don't I have the soldier's blood in me?\nThe tubes are not in me anymore and the glass jars are gone.\nSister Rita comes in and tells Dad he has to go. I don't want him to go because he looks sad. He's like Paddy Clohessy the day I gave him the raisin. When he looks sad it's the worst thing in the world and I start crying. Now what's this? says Sister Rita. Crying with all that soldier blood in you? There's a big surprise for you tomorrow, Francis. You'll never guess. Well, I'll tell you, we're bringing you a nice biscuit with your tea in the morning. Isn't that a treat? And your father will be back in a day or two, won't you, Mr. McCourt?\nDad nods and puts his hand on mine again. He looks at me, steps away, stops, comes back, kisses me on the forehead for the first time in my life and I'm so happy I feel like floating out of the bed.\nThe other two beds in my room are empty. The nurse says I'm the only typhoid patient and I'm a miracle for getting over the crisis.\nThe room next to me is empty till one morning a girl's voice says, Yoo hoo, who's there?\nI'm not sure if she's talking to me or someone in the room beyond. Yoo hoo, boy with the typhoid, are you awake?\nI am.\nAre you better?\nI am.\nWell, why are you here?\nI don't know. I'm still in the bed. They stick needles in me and\ngive me medicine.\nWhat do you look like?\nI wonder, What kind of a question is that? I don't know what to tell her.\nYoo hoo, are you there, typhoid boy?\nI am.\nWhat's your name?\nFrank.\nThat's a good name. My name is Patricia Madigan. How old are you? Ten. Oh. She sounds disappointed.\nBut I'll be eleven in August, next month.\nWell, that's better than ten. I'll be fourteen in September. Do you\nwant to know why I'm in the Fever Hospital? I do.\nI have diphtheria and something else.\nWhat's something else?\nThey don't know. They think I have a disease from foreign parts\nbecause my father used to be in Africa. I nearly died. Are you going to tell me what you look like?\nI have black hair.\nYou and millions.\nI have brown eyes with bits of green that's called hazel.\nYou and thousands.\nI have stitches on the back of my right hand and my two feet where\nthey put in the soldier's blood.\nOh, God, did they?\nThey did.\nYou won't be able to stop marching and saluting.\nThere's a swish of habit and click of beads and then Sister Rita's\nvoice. Now, now, what's this? There's to be no talking between two rooms especially when it's a boy and a girl. Do you hear me, Patricia?\nI do, Sister.\nDo you hear me, Francis?\nI do, Sister.\nYou could be giving thanks for your two remarkable recoveries. You\ncould be saying the rosary. You could be reading The Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart that's beside your beds. Don't let me come back and find you talking.\nShe comes into my room and wags her finger at me. Especially you, Francis, after thousands of boys prayed for you at the Confraternity. Give thanks, Francis, give thanks.\nShe leaves and there's silence for awhile. Then Patricia whispers, Give thanks, Francis, give thanks, and say your rosary, Francis, and I laugh so hard a nurse runs in to see if I'm all right. She's a very stern nurse from the County Kerry and she frightens me. What's this, Francis? Laughing? What is there to laugh about? Are you and that Madigan girl talking? I'll report you to Sister Rita. There's to be no laughing for you could be doing serious damage to your internal apparatus.\nShe plods out and Patricia whispers again in a heavy Kerry accent, No laughing, Francis, you could be doin' serious damage to your internal apparatus. Say your rosary, Francis, and pray for your internal apparatus.\nMam visits me on Thursdays. I'd like to see my father, too, but I'm out of danger, crisis time is over, and I'm allowed only one visitor. Besides, she says, he's back at work at Rank's Flour Mills and please God this job will last a while with the war on and the English desperate for flour. She brings me a chocolate bar and that proves Dad is working. She could never afford it on the dole. He sends me notes. He tells me my\nbrothers are all praying for me, that I should be a good boy, obey the doctors, the nuns, the nurses, and don't forget to say my prayers. He's sure St. Jude pulled me through the crisis because he's the patron saint of desperate cases and I was indeed a desperate case.\nPatricia says she has two books by her bed. One is a poetry book and that's the one she loves. The other is a short history of England and do I want it? She gives it to Seamus, the man who mops the floors every day, and he brings it to me. He says, I'm not supposed to be bringing anything from a dipteria room to a typhoid room with all the germs flying around and hiding between the pages and if you ever catch dipteria on top of the typhoid they'll know and I'll lose my good job and be out on the street singing patriotic songs with a tin cup in my hand, which I could easily do because there isn't a song ever written about Ireland's sufferings I don't know and a few songs about the joy of whiskey too.\nOh, yes, he knows Roddy McCorley. He'll sing it for me right enough but he's barely into the first verse when the Kerry nurse rushes in. What's this, Seamus? Singing? Of all the people in this hospital you should know the rules against singing. I have a good mind to report you to Sister Rita.\nAh, God, don't do that, nurse.\nVery well, Seamus. I'll let it go this one time. You know the singing could lead to a relapse in these patients.\nWhen she leaves he whispers he'll teach me a few songs because singing is good for passing the time when you're by yourself in a typhoid room. He says Patricia is a lovely girl the way she often gives him sweets from the parcel her mother sends every fortnight. He stops mopping the floor and calls to Patricia in the next room, I was telling Frankie you're a lovely girl, Patricia, and she says, You're a lovely man, Seamus. He smiles because he's an old man of forty and he never had children but the ones he can talk to here in the Fever Hospital. He says, Here's the book, Frankie. Isn't it a great pity you have to be reading all about England after all they did to us, that there isn't a history of Ireland to be had in this hospital.\nThe book tells me all about King Alfred and William the Conqueror and all the kings and queens down to Edward, who had to wait forever for his mother, Victoria, to die before he could be king. The book has the first bit of Shakespeare I ever read.\nI do believe, induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy.\nThe history writer says this is what Catherine, who is a wife of Henry the Eighth, says to Cardinal Wolsey, who is trying to have her head cut off. I don't know what it means and I don't care because it's Shakespeare and it's like having jewels in my mouth when I say the words. If I had a whole book of Shakespeare they could keep me in the hospital for a year.\nPatricia says she doesn't know what induced means or potent circumstances and she doesn't care about Shakespeare, she has her poetry book and she reads to me from beyond the wall a poem about an owl and a pussycat that went to sea in a green boat with honey and money and it makes no sense and when I say that Patricia gets huffy and says that's the last poem she'll ever read to me. She says I'm always reciting the lines from Shakespeare and they make no sense either. Seamus stops mopping again and tells us we shouldn't be fighting over poetry because we'll have enough to fight about when we grow up and get married.\nPatricia says she's sorry and I'm sorry too so she reads me part of another poem which I have to remember so I can say it back to her early in the morning or late at night when there are no nuns or nurses about, The wind was a torrent of darkness among the gusty trees, The moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor, And the highwayman came riding Riding riding The highwayman came riding, up to the old inn door.\nHe'd a French cocked hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin,\nA coat of the claret velvet,\nand breeches of brown doe skin,\nThey fitted with never a wrinkle,\nhis boots were up to the thigh.\nAnd he rode with a jewelled twinkle,\nHis pistol butts a-twinkle,\nHis rapier hilt a-twinkle,\nunder the jewelled sky.\nEvery day I can't wait for the doctors and nurses to leave me alone so I can learn a new verse from Patricia and find out what's happening to the highwayman and the landlord's red lipped daughter. I love the poem because it's exciting and almost as good as my two lines of Shakespeare. The redcoats are after the highwayman because they know he told her, I'll come to thee by moonlight, though hell should bar the way.\nI'd love to do that myself, come by moonlight for Patricia in the next room not giving a fiddler's fart though hell should bar the way. She's ready to read the last few verses when in comes the nurse from Kerry shouting at her, shouting at me, I told ye there was to be no talking between rooms. Dipthteria is never allowed to talk to typhoid and visa versa. I warned ye. And she calls out, Seamus, take this one. Take the by. Sister Rita said one more word out of him and upstairs with him. We gave ye a warning to stop the blathering but ye wouldn't. Take the by, Seamus, take him.\nAh, now, nurse, sure isn't he harmless. 'Tis only a bit o' poetry. Take that by, Seamus, take him at once.\nHe bends over me and whispers, Ah, God, I'm sorry, Frankie. Here's\nyour English history book. He slips the book under my shirt and lifts me from the bed. He whispers that I'm a feather. I try to see Patricia when we pass through her room but all I can make out is a blur of dark head on a pillow.\nSister Rita stops us in the hall to tell me I'm a great disappointment to her, that she expected me to be a good boy after what God had done for me, after all the prayers said by hundreds of boys at the Confraternity, after all the care from the nuns and nurses of the Fever Hospital, after the way they let my mother and father in to see me, a thing rarely allowed, and this is how I repaid them lying in the bed reciting silly poetry back and forth with Patricia Madigan knowing very well there was a ban on all talk between typhoid and diphtheria. She says I'll have plenty of time to reflect on my sins in the big ward upstairs and I should beg God's forgiveness for my disobedience reciting a pagan English poem about a thief on a horse and a maiden with red lips who commits a terrible sin when I could have been praying or reading the life\nof a saint. She made it her business to read that poem so she did and I'd be well advised to tell the priest in confession.\nThe Kerry nurse follows us upstairs gasping and holding on to the banister. She tells me I better not get the notion she'll be running up to this part of the world every time I have a little pain or a twinge.\nThere are twenty beds in the ward, all white, all empty. The nurse tells Seamus put me at the far end of the ward against the wall to make sure I don't talk to anyone who might be passing the door, which is very unlikely since there isn't another soul on this whole floor. She tells Seamus this was the fever ward during the Great Famine long ago and only God knows how many died here brought in too late for anything but a wash before they were buried and there are stories of cries and moans in the far reaches of the night. She says 'twould break your heart to think of what the English did to us, that if they didn't put the blight on the potato they didn't do much to take it off. No pity. No feeling at all for the people that died in this very ward, children suffering and dying here while the English feasted on roast beef and guzzled the best of wine in their big houses, little children with their mouths all green from trying to eat the grass in the fields beyond, God bless us and save us and guard us from future famines.\nSeamus says 'twas a terrible thing indeed and he wouldn't want to be walking these halls in the dark with all the little green mouths gaping at him. The nurse takes my temperature, 'Tis up a bit, have a good sleep for yourself now that you're away from the chatter with Patricia Madigan below who will never know a gray hair.\nShe shakes her head at Seamus and he gives her a sad shake back.\nNurses and nuns never think you know what they're talking about. If you're ten going on eleven you're supposed to be simple like my uncle Pat Sheehan who was dropped on his head. You can't ask questions. You can't show you understand what the nurse said about Patricia Madigan, that she's going to die, and you can't show you want to cry over this girl who taught you a lovely poem which the nun says is bad.\nThe nurse tells Seamus she has to go and he's to sweep the lint from under my bed and mop up a bit around the ward. Seamus tells me she's a right oul' bitch for running to Sister Rita and complaining about the poem going between the two rooms, that you can't catch a disease from a poem unless it's love ha ha and that's not bloody likely when you're what? ten going on eleven? He never heard the likes of it, a little fella shifted upstairs for saying a poem and he has a good mind to go to the Limerick Leader and tell them print the whole thing except he has this job and he'd lose it if ever Sister Rita found out. Anyway, Frankie, you'll be outa here one of these fine days and you can read all the poetry you want though I don't know about Patricia below, I don't know about Patricia, God help us.\nHe knows about Patricia in two days because she got out of the bed to go to the lavatory when she was supposed to use a bedpan and collapsed and died in the lavatory. Seamus is mopping the floor and there are tears on his cheeks and he's saying, 'Tis a dirty rotten thing to die in a lavatory when you're lovely in yourself. She told me she was sorry she had you reciting that poem and getting you shifted from the room, Frankie. She said 'twas all her fault.\nIt wasn't, Seamus.\nI know and didn't I tell her that.\nPatricia is gone and I'll never know what happened to the highwayman and Bess, the landlord's daughter. I ask Seamus but he doesn't know any poetry at all especially English poetry. He knew an Irish poem once but it was about fairies and had no sign of a highwayman in it. Still he'll ask the men in his local pub where there's always someone reciting something and he'll bring it back to me. Won't I be busy meanwhile reading my short history of England and finding out all\ntheir perfidy. That's what Seamus says, perfidy, and I don't know\nmeans and he doesn't know what it means but if it's something the\ndo it must be terrible.\nHe comes three times a week to mop the floor and the nurse is there every morning to take my temperature and pulse. The doctor listens to my chest with the thing hanging from his neck. They all say, And how's our little soldier today? A girl with a blue dress brings meals three times a day and never talks to me. Seamus says she's not right in the head so don't say a word to her.\nThe July days are long and I fear the dark. There are only two ceiling lights in the ward and they're switched off when the tea tray is taken away and the nurse gives me pills. The nurse tells me go to sleep but I can't because I see people in the nineteen beds in the ward all dying and green around their mouths where they tried to eat grass and moaning for soup Protestant soup any soup and I cover my face with the pillow hoping they won't come and stand around the bed clawing at me and howling for bits of the chocolate bar my mother brought last week.\nNo, she didn't bring it. She had to send it in because I can't have any more visitors. Sister Rita tells me a visit to the Fever Hospital is a privilege and after my bad behavior with Patricia Madigan and that poem I can't have the privilege anymore. She says I'll be going home in a few weeks and my job is to concentrate on getting better and learn to walk again after being in bed for six weeks and I can get out of bed tomorrow after breakfast. I don't know why she says I have to learn how to walk when I've been walking since I was a baby but when the nurse stands me by the side of the bed I fall to the floor and the nurse laughs, See, you're a baby again.\nI practice walking from bed to bed back and forth back and forth. I don't want to be a baby. I don't want to be in this empty ward with no Patricia and no highwayman and no red lipped landlord's daughter. I don't want the ghosts of children with green mouths pointing bony fingers at me and clamoring for bits of my chocolate bar.\nSeamus says a man in his pub knew all the verses of the highwayman poem and it has a very sad end. Would I like him to say it because he never learned how to read and he had to carry the poem in his head? He stands in the middle of the ward leaning on his mop and recites, Tlot- tlot, in the frosty silence! Tlot-tlot in the echoing night!\nNearer he came and nearer! Her face was like a light!\nHer eyes grew wide for a moment, she drew one last deep breath, Then her finger moved in the moonlight, Her musket shattered the moonlight, Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him-with her death.\nHe hears the shot and escapes but when he learns at dawn how Bess died he goes into a rage and returns for revenge only to be shot down by the redcoats.\nBlood red were his spurs in the golden noon; wine red was his velvet coat, When they shot him down on the highway, Down like a dog on\nabout\nwhat it\nEnglish\nthe highway, And he lay in his blood on the highway, with a bunch of lace at his throat.\nSeamus wipes his sleeve across his face and sniffles. He says, There was no call at all to shift you up here away from Patricia when you didn't even know what happened to the highwayman and Bess. 'Tis a very sad story and when I said it to my wife she wouldn't stop crying the whole night till we went to bed. She said there was no call for them redcoats to shoot that highwayman, they are responsible for half the troubles of the world and they never had any pity on the Irish, either. Now if you want to know any more poems, Frankie, tell me and I'll get them from the pub and bring 'em back in my head.\nThe girl with the blue dress who's not right in the head suddenly says one day, Would you like a book for to read? and she brings me The Amazing Quest of Mr. Ernest Bliss by E. Phillips Oppenheim, which is all about an Englishman who is fed up and doesn't know what to do with himself every day even though he's so rich he can't count his money. His manservant brings him the morning paper the tea the egg the toast and marmalade and he says, Take it away, life is empty. He can't read his paper, he can't eat his egg, and he pines away. His doctor tells him go and live among the poor in the East End of London and he'll learn to love life, which he does and falls in love with a girl who is poor but honest and very intelligent and they get married and move into his house in the West End which is the rich part because it's easier to help the poor and not be fed up when you're nice and comfortable.\nSeamus likes me to tell him what I'm reading. He says that story about Mr. Ernest Bliss is a made-up story because no one in his right mind would have to go to a doctor over having too much money and not eating his egg though you never know. It might be like that in England. You'd never find the likes of that in Ireland. If you didn't eat your egg here you'd be carted off to the lunatic asylum or reported to the bishop.\nI can't wait to go home and tell Malachy about this man who won't eat his egg. Malachy will fall down on the floor laughing because such a thing could never happen. He'll say I'm making it up but when I tell him this story is about an Englishman he'll understand.\nI can't tell the girl in the blue dress that this story was silly because she might have a fit. She says if you're finished with that book I'll bring you another one because there's a whole box of books left behind by patients from the old days. She brings me a book called Tom Brown's School-Days, which is hard to read, and no end of books by P. G. Wodehouse, who makes me laugh over Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and Jeeves and all the Mulliners. Bertie Wooster is rich but he eats his egg every morning for fear of what Jeeves might say. I wish I could talk to the girl in the blue dress or anyone about the books but I'm afraid the Kerry nurse or Sister Rita might find out and they'd move me to a bigger ward upstairs with fifty empty beds and Famine ghosts galore with green mouths and bony fingers pointing. At night I lie in bed thinking about Tom Brown and his adventures at Rugby School and all the characters in P. G. Wodehouse. I can dream about the red lipped landlord's daughter and the highwayman, and the nurses and nuns can do nothing about it. It's lovely to know the world can't interfere with the inside of your head.\nIt's August and I'm eleven. I've been in this hospital for two months and I wonder if they'll let me out for Christmas. The Kerry nurse tells me I should get down on my two knees and thank God I'm alive at all at all and not be complaining.\nI'm not complaining, nurse, I'm only wondering if I'll be home for Christmas.\nShe won't answer me. She tells me behave myself or she'll send Sister Rita up to me and then I'll behave myself.\nMam comes to the hospital on my birthday and sends up a package with two chocolate bars and a note with names of people in the lane telling me get better and come home and you're a great soldier, Frankie. The nurse lets me talk to her through the window and it's hard because the windows are high and I have to stand on Seamus's shoulders. I tell Mam I want to go home but she says I'm a bit too weak and surely I'll be out in no time. Seamus says, 'Tis a grand thing to be eleven because any day now you'll be a man shaving and all and ready to get out and get a job and drink your pint good as any man.\nAfter fourteen weeks Sister Rita tells me I can go home and aren't I a lucky boy that the day will be the feast of St. Francis of Assisi. She tells me I was a very good patient, except for that little problem with the poem and Patricia Madigan, God rest her, and I'm invited to come back and have a big Christmas dinner in the hospital. Mam comes for me and with my weak legs it takes us a long time to walk to the bus at Union Cross. She says, Take your time. After three and a half months we can spare an hour.\nPeople are at their doors on Barrack Road and Roden Lane telling me it's grand to see me back, that I'm a great soldier, a credit to my father and mother. Malachy and Michael run up to me in the lane and say, God, you're walking very slow. Can't you run anymore?\nIt's a bright day and I'm happy till I see Dad sitting in the kitchen with Alphie on his lap and there's an empty feeling in my heart because I know he's out of work again. All along I was sure he had a job, Mam told me he did, and I thought there would be no shortage of food and shoes. He smiles at me and tells Alphie, Och, there's your big brother home from the hospital.\nMam tells him what the doctor said, that I'm to have plenty of nourishing food and rest. The doctor said beef would be the right thing for building me up again. Dad nods. Mam makes beef tea from a cube and Malachy and Mike watch me drink it. They say they'd like some too but Mam says go away, ye didn't have the typhoid. She says the doctor wants me to go to bed early. She tried to get rid of the fleas but they're worse than ever with the warm weather we're having. Besides, she says, they won't get much out of you all bones and little skin.\nI lie in bed and think of the hospital where the white sheets were changed every day and there wasn't a sign of a flea. There was a lavatory where you could sit and read your book till someone asked if you were dead. There was a bath where you could sit in hot water as long as you liked and say, I do believe, Induced by potent circumstances That thou art mine enemy, And saying that helps me fall asleep.\nWhen Malachy and Michael get up for school in the morning Mam tells me I can stay in bed. Malachy is in fifth class now with Mr. O'Dea and he likes to tell everyone he's learning the big red catechism for Confirmation and Mr. O'Dea is telling them all about state of grace and Euclid and how the English tormented the Irish for eight hundred long years.\nI don't want to stay in bed anymore. The October days are lovely and I want to sit outside looking up the lane at the way the sun slants along the wall opposite our house. Mikey Moloney brings me P. G.\nWodehouse books his father gets from the library and I have great days with Ukridge and Bertie Wooster and all the Mulliners. Dad lets me read his favorite book, John Mitchel's Jail Journal, which is all about a great Irish rebel the English condemned to exile in Van Diemen's land in Australia. The English tell John Mitchel he's free to come and go as he pleases all over Van Diemen's land if he gives his word of honor as a gentleman he won't try to escape. He gives his word till a ship comes to help him escape and he goes to the office of the English magistrate and says, I'm escaping, jumps on his horse and winds up in New York. Dad says he doesn't mind if I read silly English books by P. G. Wodehouse as long as I don't forget the men who did their bit and gave their lives for Ireland.\nI can't stay at home forever and Mam takes me back to Leamy's School in November. The new headmaster, Mr. O'Halloran, says he's sorry, I've missed over two months of school and I have to be put back in fifth class. Mam says surely I'm ready for sixth class. After all, she says, he's missed only a few weeks. Mr. O'Halloran says he's sorry, take the boy next door to Mr. O'Dea.\nWe walk along the hallway and I tell Mam I don't want to be in fifth class. Malachy is in that class and I don't want to be in a class with my brother who is a year younger. I made my Confirmation last year. He didn't. I'm older. I'm not bigger anymore because of the typhoid but I'm older.\nMam says, It won't kill you.\nShe doesn't care and I'm put into that class with Malachy and I know all his friends are there sneering at me because I was put back. Mr. O'Dea makes me sit in the front and tells me get that sour look off my puss or I'll feel the end of his ash plant.\nThen a miracle happens and it's all because of St. Francis of Assisi, my favorite saint, and Our Lord Himself. I find a penny in the street that first day back at school and I want to run to Kathleen O'Connell's for a big square of Cleeves' toffee but I can't run because my legs are still weak from the typhoid and sometimes I have to hold on to a wall. I'm desperate for the Cleeves'toffee but I'm also desperate to get out of fifth class.\nI know I have to go to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi. He's the only one who will listen but he's at the other end of Limerick and it takes me an hour to walk there, sitting on steps, holding on to walls. It's a penny to light a candle and I wonder if I should just light the candle and keep the penny. No, St. Francis would know. He loves the bird in the air and the fish in the stream but he's not a fool. I light the candle, I kneel at his statue and beg him to get me out of fifth class where I'm stuck with my brother, who is probably going around the lane now bragging that his big brother was kept back. St. Francis doesn't say a word but I know he's listening and I know he'll get me out of that class. It's the least he could do after all my trouble coming to his statue, sitting on steps, holding on to walls, when I could have gone to St. Joseph's Church and lit a candle to the Little Flower or the Sacred Heart of Jesus Himself. What's the use of being named after him if he's going to desert me in my hour of need?\nI have to sit in Mr. O'Dea's class listening to the catechism and all the other stuff he taught last year. I'd like to raise my hand and give the answers but he says, Be quiet, let your brother answer. He gives them tests in arithmetic and makes me sit there and correct them. He\ndictates to them in Irish and makes me correct what they've written. Then he gives me special compositions to write and makes me read them to the class because of all I learned from him last year. He tells the class, Frank McCourt is going to show you how well he learned to write in this class last year. He's going to write a composition on Our Lord, aren't you, McCourt? He's going to tell us what it would be like if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick which has the Arch Confraternity of the Holy Family and is the holiest city in Ireland. We know that if Our Lord had grown up in Limerick He would never have been crucified because the people of Limerick were always good Catholics and not given to crucifixion. So, McCourt, you are to go home and write that composition and bring it in tomorrow.\nDad says Mr. O'Dea has a great imagination but didn't Our Lord suffer enough on the cross without sticking Him in Limerick on top of it with the damp from the River Shannon. He puts on his cap and goes for a long walk and I have to think about Our Lord by myself and wonder what I'm going to write tomorrow.\nThe next day Mr. O'Dea says, All right, McCourt, read your composition to the class.\nThe name of my composition is-\nThe title, McCourt, the title.\nThe title of my composition is, \"Jesus and the Weather. \"\nWhat?\n\"Jesus and the Weather. \"\nAll right, read it.\nThis is my composition. I don't think Jesus Who is Our Lord would\nhave liked the weather in Limerick because it's always raining and the Shannon keeps the whole city damp. My father says the Shannon is a killer river because it killed my two brothers. When you look at pictures of Jesus He's always wandering around ancient Israel in a sheet. It never rains there and you never hear of anyone coughing or getting consumption or anything like that and no one has a job there because all they do is stand around and eat manna and shake their fists and go to crucifixions.\nAnytime Jesus got hungry all He had to do was walk up the road to a fig tree or an orange tree and have His fill. If He wanted a pint He could wave His hand over a big glass and there was the pint. Or He could visit Mary Magdalene and her sister, Martha, and they'd give Him His dinner no questions asked and He'd get his feet washed and dried with Mary Magdalene's hair while Martha washed the dishes, which I don't think is fair. Why should she have to wash the dishes while her sister sits out there chatting away with Our Lord? It's a good thing Jesus decided to be born Jewish in that warm place because if he was born in Limerick he'd catch the consumption and be dead in a month and there wouldn't be any Catholic Church and there wouldn't be any Communion or Confirmation and we wouldn't have to learn the catechism and write compositions about Him. The End.\nMr. O'Dea is quiet and gives me a strange look and I'm worried because when he's quiet like that it means someone is going to suffer. He says, McCourt, who wrote that composition?\nI did, sir.\nDid your father write that composition? He didn't, sir.\nCome here, McCourt.\nI follow him out the door, along the hall to the headmaster's room. Mr. O'Dea shows him my composition and Mr. O'Halloran gives me the strange look, too. Did you write this composition?\nI did, sir.\nI'm taken out of the fifth class and put into Mr. O'Halloran's sixth class with all the boys I know, Paddy Clohessy, Fintan Slattery, The Question Quigley, and when school is over that day I have to go back down to the statue of St. Francis of Assisi to thank him even if my legs are still weak from the typhoid and I have to sit on steps and hold on to walls and I wonder was it something good I said in that composition or something bad.\nMr. Thomas L. O'Halloran teaches three classes in one room, sixth, seventh, eighth. He has a head like President Roosevelt and he wears gold glasses. He wears suits, navy blue or gray, and there's a gold watch chain that hangs across his belly from pocket to pocket in his waistcoat. We call him Hoppy because he has a short leg and hops when he walks. He knows what we call him and he says, Yes, I'm Hoppy and I'll hop on you. He carries a long stick, a pointer, and if you don't pay attention or give a stupid answer he gives you three slaps on each hand or whacks you across the backs of your legs. He makes you learn everything by heart, everything, and that makes him the hardest master in the school. He loves America and makes us know all the American states in alphabetical order. He makes charts of Irish grammar, Irish history and algebra at home, hangs them on an easel and we have to chant our way through the cases, conjugations and declensions of Irish, famous names and battles, proportions, ratios, equations. We have to know all the important dates in Irish history. He tells us what is important and why. No master ever told us why before. If you asked why you'd be hit on the head. Hoppy doesn't call us idiots and if you ask a question he doesn't go into a rage. He's the only master who stops and says, Do ye understand what I'm talking about? Do ye want to ask a question?\nIt's a shock to everyone when he says, the Battle of Kinsale in sixteen nought one was the saddest moment in Irish history, a close battle with cruelty and atrocities on both sides.\nCruelty on both sides? The Irish side? How could that be? All the other masters told us the Irish always fought nobly, they always fought the fair fight. He recites and makes us remember, They went forth to battle, but they always fell, Their eyes were fixed above the sullen shields.\nNobly they fought and bravely, but not well, And sank heart wounded by a subtle spell.\nIf they lost it was because of traitors and informers. But I want to know about these Irish atrocities.\nSir, did the Irish commit atrocities at the Battle of Kinsale?\nThey did, indeed. It is recorded that they killed prisoners but they were no better nor worse than the English.\nMr. O'Halloran can't lie. He's the headmaster. All these years we were told the Irish were always noble and they made brave speeches before the English hanged them. Now Hoppy O'Halloran is saying the Irish did bad things. Next thing he'll be saying the English did good things. He says, You have to study and learn so that you can make up your own mind about history and everything else but you can't make up an empty mind. Stock your mind, stock your mind. It is your house of treasure and no one in the world can interfere with it. If you won the Irish Sweepstakes and\nbought a house that needed furniture would you fill it with bits and pieces of rubbish? Your mind is your house and if you fill it with rubbish from the cinemas it will rot in your head. You might be poor, your shoes might be broken, but your mind is a palace.\nHe calls us one by one to the front of the room and looks at our shoes. He wants to know why they're broken or why we have no shoes at all. He tells us this is a disgrace and he's going to have a raffle to raise money so that we can have strong warm boots for the winter. He gives us books of tickets and we swarm all over Limerick for Leamy's School boot fund, first prize five pounds, five prizes of a pound each. Eleven boys with no boots get new boots. Malachy and I don't get any because we have shoes on our feet even if the soles are worn away and we wonder why we ran all over Limerick selling tickets so that other boys could get boots. Fintan Slattery says we gain plenary Indulgences for works of charity and Paddy Clohessy says, Fintan, would you ever go and have a good shit for yourself.\nI know when Dad does the bad thing. I know when he drinks the dole money and Mam is desperate and has to beg at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and ask for credit at Kathleen O'Connell's shop but I don't want to back away from him and run to Mam. How can I do that when I'm up with him early every morning with the whole world asleep? He lights the fire and makes the tea and sings to himself or reads the paper to me in a whisper that won't wake up the rest of the family. Mikey Molloy stole Cuchulain, the Angel on the Seventh Step is gone someplace else, but my father in the morning is still mine. He gets the Irish Press early and tells me about the world, Hitler, Mussolini, Franco. He says this war is none of our business because the English are up to their tricks again. He tells me about the great Roosevelt in Washington and the great De Valera in Dublin. In the morning we have the world to ourselves and he never tells me I should die for Ireland. He tells me about the old days in Ireland when the English wouldn't let the Catholics have schools because they wanted to keep the people ignorant, that the Catholic children met in hedge schools in the depths of the country and learned English, Irish, Latin and Greek. The people loved learning. They loved stories and poetry even if none of this was any good for getting a job. Men, women and children would gather in ditches to hear those great masters and everyone wondered at how much a man could carry in his head. The masters risked their lives going from ditch to ditch and hedge to hedge because if the English caught them teaching they might be transported to foreign parts or worse. He tells me school is easy now, you don't have to sit in a ditch learning your sums or the glorious history of Ireland. I should be good in school and some day I'll go back to America and get an inside job where I'll be sitting at a desk with two fountain pens in my pocket, one red and one blue, making decisions. I'll be in out of the rain and I'll have a suit and shoes and a warm place to live and what more could a man want? He says you can do anything in America, it's the land of opportunity. You can be a fisherman in Maine or a farmer in California. America is not like Limerick, a gray place with a river that kills.\nWhen you have your father to yourself by the fire in the morning you don't need Cuchulain or the Angel on the Seventh Step or anything.\nAt night he helps us with our exercises. Mam says they call it homework in America but here it's exercises, the sums, the English, the Irish, the history. He can't help us with Irish because he's from the North and lacking in the native tongue. Malachy offers to teach him all\nthe Irish words he knows but Dad says it's too late, you can't teach an old dog a new bark. Before bed we sit around the fire and if we say, Dad, tell us a story, he makes up one about someone in the lane and the story will take us all over the world, up in the air, under the sea and back to the lane. Everyone in the story is a different color and everything is upside down and backward. Motor cars and planes go under water and submarines fly through the air. Sharks sit in trees and giant salmon sport with kangaroos on the moon. Polar bears wrestle with elephants in Australia and penguins teach Zulus how to play bagpipes. After the story he takes us upstairs and kneels with us while we say our prayers. We say the Our Father, three Hail Marys, God bless the Pope. God bless Mam, God bless our dead sister and brothers, God bless Ireland, God bless De Valera, and God bless anyone who gives Dad a job. He says, Go to sleep, boys, because holy God is watching you and He always knows if you're not good.\nI think my father is like the Holy Trinity with three people in him, the one in the morning with the paper, the one at night with the stories and the prayers, and then the one who does the bad thing and comes home with the smell of whiskey and wants us to die for Ireland.\nI feel sad over the bad thing but I can't back away from him because the one in the morning is my real father and if I were in America I could say, I love you, Dad, the way they do in the films, but you can't say that in Limerick for fear you might be laughed at. You're allowed to say you love God and babies and horses that win but anything else is a softness in the head.\nDay and night we're tormented in that kitchen with people emptying their buckets. Mam says it's not the River Shannon that will kill us but the stink from that lavatory outside our door. It's bad enough in the winter when everything flows over and seeps under our door but worse in the warm weather when there are flies and bluebottles and rats.\nThere is a stable next to the lavatory where they keep the big horse from Gabbett's coal yard. His name is Finn the Horse and we all love him but the stable man from the coal yard doesn't take proper care of the stable and the stink travels to our house. The stink from the lavatory and the stable attracts rats and we have to chase them with our new dog, Lucky. He loves to corner the rats and then we smash them to bits with rocks or sticks or stab them with the hay fork in the stable. The horse himself is frightened by the rats and we have to be careful when he rears up. He knows we're not rats because we bring him apples when we rob an orchard out the country.\nSometimes the rats escape and run into our house and into the coal hole under the stairs where it's pitch dark and you can't see them. Even when we bring in a candle we can't find them because they dig holes everywhere and we don't know where to look. If we have a fire we can boil water and pour it slowly in from the kettle spot and that will drive them out of the hole between our legs and out the door again unless Lucky is there to catch them in his teeth and shake the life out of them. We expect him to eat the rats but he'll leave them in the lane with their guts hanging out and run to my father for a piece of bread dipped in tea. People in the lane say that's a peculiar way for a dog to behave but then what would you expect from a dog of the McCourts.\nThe minute there's a sign of a rat or a mention of one Mam is out the door and up the lane. She'd rather walk the streets of Limerick forever than stay one minute in a house that has a rat in it and she can\nnever rest because she knows that with the stable and the lavatory there's always a rat nearby with his family waiting for their dinner.\nWe fight the rats and we fight the stink from that lavatory. We'd like to keep our door open in the warm weather but you can't when people are trotting down the lane to empty their brimming buckets. Some families are worse than others and Dad hates all of them even though Mam tells him it's not their fault if the builders a hundred years ago put up houses with no lavatories but this one outside our door. Dad says the people should empty their buckets in the middle of the night when we are asleep so that we won't be disturbed by the stink.\nThe flies are nearly as bad as the rats. On warm days they swarm to the stable and when a bucket is emptied they swarm to the lavatory. If Mam cooks anything they swarm into the kitchen and Dad says it's disgusting to think the fly sitting there on the sugar bowl was on the toilet bowl, or what's left of it, a minute ago. If you have an open sore they find it and torment you. By day you have the flies, by night you have the fleas. Mam says there's one good thing about fleas, they're clean, but flies are filthy, you never know where they came from and they carry diseases galore. We can chase the rats and kill them.\nWe can slap at the flies and the fleas and kill them but there's nothing we can do about the neighbors and their buckets. If we're out in the lane playing and we see someone with a bucket we call to our own house, Bucket coming, close the door, close the door, and whoever is inside runs to the door. In warm weather we run to close the door all day because we know which families have the worst buckets. There are families whose fathers have jobs and if they get into the habit of cooking with curry we know their buckets will stink to the heavens and make us sick. Now with the war on and men sending money from England more and more families are cooking with curry and our house is filled with the stink day and night. We know the families with the curry, we know the ones with the cabbage. Mam is sick all the time, Dad takes longer and longer walks into the country, and we play outside as much as we can and far from the lavatory. Dad doesn't complain about the River Shannon anymore. He knows now the lavatory is worse and he takes me with him to the Town Hall to complain. The man there says, Mister, all I can tell you is you can move. Dad says we can't afford to move and the man says there's nothing he can do. Dad says, This is not India. This is a Christian country. The lane needs more lavatories. The man says, Do you expect Limerick to start building lavatories in houses that are falling down anyway, that will be demolished after the war? Dad says that lavatory could kill us all. The man says we live in dangerous times.\nMam says it's hard enough keeping a fire going to cook the Christmas dinner but if I'm going to Christmas dinner at the hospital I'll have to wash myself from top to bottom. She wouldn't give it to Sister Rita to say I was neglected or ripe for another disease. She boils a pot of water early in the morning before Mass and nearly scalds the scalp off me. She scours my ears and scrubs my skin so hard it tingles. She can afford tuppence for the bus out to the hospital but I'll have to walk back and that will be good for me because I'll be stuffed with food and now she has to get the fire going again for the pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes which she got once again through the kindness of the St. Vincent de Paul Society and she's determined this will be the last time we celebrate the birth of Our Lord with pig's head.\nNext year we'll have a goose or a nice ham and why wouldn't we, isn't Limerick famous the world over for the ham?\nSister Rita says, Now would you look at this, our little soldier looking so healthy. No meat on the bones but still. Now tell me, did you go to Mass this morning?\nI did, Sister.\nAnd did you receive?\nI did, Sister.\nShe takes me into an empty ward and tells me sit there on that\nchair it won't be long now till I get my dinner. She leaves and I wonder if I'll be eating with nuns and nurses or will I be in a ward with children having their Christmas dinner. In awhile my dinner is brought in by the girl in the blue dress who brought me the books. She places the tray on the side of a bed and I pull up a chair. She frowns at me and screws up her face. You, she says, that's your dinner an' I'm not bringin' you any books.\nThe dinner is delicious, turkey, mashed potatoes, peas, jelly and custard, and a pot of tea. The jelly and custard dish looks delicious and I can't resist it so I'll have it first there's no one there to notice but when I'm eating it the girl in the blue dress comes in with bread and says, What are you doin'?\nNothing.\nYes, you are. You're atin' the sweet before the dinner, and she runs out calling, Sister Rita, Sister Rita, come in quick, and the nun rushes in, Francis, are you all right?\nI am, Sister.\nHe's not all right, Sister. He do be atin' his jelly an custard before his dinner. That's a sin, Sister.\nAh, now, dear, you run along and I'll talk to Francis about that.\nDo, Sister, talk to him or all the childer in the hospital will be atin' their sweet before their dinner an' then where will we be?\nIndeed, indeed, where will we be? Run along now.\nThe girl leaves and Sister Rita smiles at me. God love her, she doesn't miss a thing even in her confusion. We have to be patient with her, Francis, the way she's touched.\nShe leaves and it's quiet in that empty ward and when I'm finished I don't know what to do because you're not supposed to do anything till they tell you. Hospitals and schools always tell you what to do. I wait a long time till the girl in the blue dress comes in for the tray. Are you finished? she says.\nand I tells\nI am.\nWell, that's all you're gettin' an' now you can go home.\nSurely girls who are not right in the head can't tell you go home\nwonder if I should wait for Sister Rita. A nurse in the hallway\nme Sister Rita is having her dinner and is not to be bothered. It's a long walk from Union Cross to Barrack Hill and when I get\nhome my family are up in Italy and well into their pig's head and cabbage and floury white potatoes. I tell them about my Christmas dinner. Mam wants to know if I had it with the nurses and nuns and she gets a bit angry when I tell her I ate alone in a ward and that's no way to treat a child. She tells me sit down and have some pig's head and I force it into my mouth and I'm so stuffed I have to lie on the bed with my belly sticking out a mile.\nIt's early in the morning and there's a motor car outside our door, the first one we've ever seen in the lane. There are men in suits looking in the door of the stable of Finn the Horse and there must be something wrong because you never see men with suits in the lane.\nIt's Finn the Horse. He's lying on the floor of the stable looking up the lane and there's white stuff like milk around his mouth. The stable man who takes care of Finn the Horse says he found him like that this morning and it's strange because he's always up and ready for his feed. The men are shaking their heads. My brother Michael says to one of the men, Mister, what's up with Finn?\nSick horse, son. Go home.\nThe stable man who takes care of Finn has the whiskey smell on him. He says to Michael, That horse is a goner. We have to shoot him.\nMichael pulls at my hand. Frank, they're not to shoot him. Tell them. You're big.\nThe stable man says, Go home, boy. Go home.\nMichael attacks him, kicks him, scrawbs the back of his hand, and the man sends Michael flying. Hould that brother of yours, he tells me, hould him.\nOne of the other men takes something yellow and brown from a bag, goes to Finn, puts it to his head and there's a sharp crack. Finn shivers. Michael screams at the man and attacks him too but the man says, The horse was sick, son. He's better off.\nThe men in suits drive away and the stable man says he has to wait for the lorry to take Finn away, he can't leave him alone or the rats will be at him. He wants to know if we'd keep an eye on the horse with our dog Lucky while he goes to the pub, he's blue mouldy for a pint.\nNo rat has a chance to get near Finn the Horse the way Michael is there with a stick small as he is. The man comes back smelling of porter and then there's the big lorry to take the horse away, a big lorry with three men and two great planks that slope from the back of the lorry to Finn's head. The three men and the stable man tie ropes around Finn and pull him up the planks and the people in the lane yell at the men because of the nails and broken wood in the planks that catch at Finn and tear out bits of his hide and streak the planks with bright pink horse blood.\nYe are destroyin' that horse.\nCan't ye have respect for the dead?\nGo easy with that poor horse.\nThe stable man says, For the love o' Jaysus what are ye squawkin'\nabout? 'Tis only a dead horse, and Michael runs at him again with his head down and his small fists flying till the stable man gives him a shove that sends him on his back and Mam goes at the stable man in such a rage he runs up the planks and over Finn's body to escape. He comes back drunk in the evening to sleep it off and after he leaves there's a smoldering in the hay and the stable burns down the rats running up the lane with every boy and dog chasing them till they escape into the streets of respectable people.\nIX\nMam says, Alphie is enough. I'm worn out. That's the end of it. No more children.\nDad says, The good Catholic woman must perform her wifely duties and submit to her husband or face eternal damnation.\nMam says, As long as there are no more children eternal damnation sounds attractive enough to me.\nWhat is Dad to do? There's a war on. English agents are recruiting Irishmen to work in their munitions factories, the pay is good, there are no jobs in Ireland, and if the wife turns her back to you there's no shortage of women in England where the able men are off fighting Hitler and Mussolini and you can do anything you like as long as you remember you're Irish and lower class and don't try to rise above your station.\nFamilies up and down the lane are getting telegram money orders from their fathers in England. They rush to the post office to cash the money orders so they can shop and show the world their good fortune on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The boys get their hair cut on Saturdays, the women curl their hair with iron tongs hot from the fire. They're very grand now the way they pay sixpence or even a shilling for seats at the Savoy Cinema where you'll meet a better class of people than the lower classes who fill the tuppenny seats in the gods at the Lyric Cinema and are never done shouting at the screen, the kind of people if you don't mind who are liable to cheer on the Africans when they throw spears at Tarzan or the Indians when they're scalping the United States Cavalry. The new rich people go home after Mass on Sundays all airs and stuff themselves with meat and potatoes, sweets and cakes galore, and they think nothing of drinking their tea from delicate little cups which stand in saucers to catch the tea that overflows and when they lift the cups they stick out their little fingers to show how refined they are. Some stop going to fish and chip shops altogether because you see nothing in those places but drunken soldiers and night girls and men that drank their dole and their wives screeching at them to come home. The brave new rich will be seen at the Savoy Restaurant or the Stella drinking tea, eating little buns, patting their lips with serviettes if you don't mind, coming home on the bus and complaining the service is not what it used to be. They have electricity now so they can see things they never saw before and when darkness falls they turn on the new wireless to hear how the war is going. They thank God for Hitler because if he hadn't marched all over Europe the men of Ireland would still be at home scratching their arses on the queue at the Labour Exchange.\nSome families sing,\nYip aye aidy aye ay aye oh\nYip aye aidy aye ay,\nWe don't care about England or France, All we want is the German advance.\nIf there's a chill in the air they'll turn on the electric fire for the comfort that's in it and sit in their kitchens listening to the news declaring how sorry they are for the English women and children dying under the German bombs but look what England did to us for eight hundred years.\nThe families with fathers in England are able to lord it over the families that don't. At dinnertime and teatime the new rich mothers stand at their doors and call to their children, Mikey, Kathleen, Paddy, come in for yeer dinner. Come in for the lovely leg o'lamb and the gorgeous green peas and the floury white potatoes.\nSean, Josie, Peggy, come in for yeer tea, come in at wanst for the fresh bread and butter and the gorgeous blue duck egg what no one else in the lane have.\nBrendan, Annie, Patsy, come in for the fried black puddin', the sizzlin' sausages and the lovely trifle soaked in the best of Spanish sherry.\nAt times like this Mam tells us to stay inside. We have nothing but bread and tea and she doesn't want the tormenting neighbors to see us with our tongues hanging out, suffering over the lovely smells floating up and down the lane. She says 'tis easy to see they're not used to having anything the way they brag about everything. 'Tis a real low-class mind that will call out the door and tell the world what they're having for the supper. She says 'tis their way of getting a rise out of us because Dad is a foreigner from the North and he won't have anything to do with any of them. Dad says all that food comes from English money and no luck will come to those who took it but what could you expect from Limerick anyway, people who profit from Hitler's war, people who will work and fight for the English. He says he'll never go over there and help England win a war. Mam says, No, you'll stay here where there's no work and hardly a lump of coal to boil water for the tea. No, you'll stay here and drink the dole when the humor is on you. You'll watch your sons going around with broken shoes and their arses hanging out of their trousers. Every house in the lane has electricity and we're lucky if we have a candle. God above, if I had the fare I'd be off to England myself for I'm sure they need women in the factories.\nDad says a factory is no place for a woman.\nMam says, Sitting on your arse by the fire is no place for a man. I say to him, Why can't you go to England, Dad, so we can have\nelectricity and a wireless and Mam can stand at the door and tell the world what we're having at dinnertime?\nHe says, Don't you want to have your father here at home with you?\nI do but you can come back at the end of the war and we can all go to America.\nHe sighs, Och, aye, och, aye. All right he'll go to England after Christmas because America is in the war now and the cause must be just. He'd never go if the Americans hadn't gone in. He tells me I'll have to be the man of the house, and he signs up with an agent to work in a factory in Coventry which, everyone says, is the most bombed city in England. The agent says, There's plenty of work for willing men. You can work overtime till you drop and if you save it up, mate, you'll be Rockefeller at the end of the war.\nWe're up early to see Dad off at the railway station. Kathleen O'Connell at the shop knows Dad is off to England and money will be flowing back so she's happy to let Mam have credit for tea, milk, sugar, bread, butter and an egg.\nAn egg.\nMam says, This egg is for your father. He needs the nourishment for the long journey before him.\nIt's a hard-boiled egg and Dad peels off the shell. He slices the egg five ways and gives each of us a bit to put on our bread. Mam says, Don't be such a fool. Dad says, What would a man be doing with a whole egg to himself? Mam has tears on her eyelashes. She pulls her chair over to the fireplace. We all eat our bread and egg and watch her cry till she says, What are ye gawkin' at? and turns away to look into the ashes. Her\nbread and egg are still on the table and I wonder if she has any plans for them. They look delicious and I'm still hungry but Dad gets up and brings them to her with the tea. She shakes her head but he presses them on her and she eats and drinks, snuffling and crying. He sits opposite her a while, silent, till she looks up at the clock and says, 'Tis time to go. He puts on his cap and picks up his bag. Mam wraps Alphie in an old blanket and we set off through the streets of Limerick.\nThere are other families in the streets. The going away fathers walk ahead, the mothers carry babies or push prams. A mother with a pram will say to other mothers, God above, missus, you must be fagged out carrying that child. Sure, why don't you stick him into the pram here and rest your poor arms.\nPrams might be packed with four or five babies squalling away because the prams are old and the wheels bockety and the babies are rocked till they get sick and throw up their goody.\nThe men call to each other. Grand day, Mick. Lovely day for the journey, Joe. 'Tis, indeed, Mick. Arrah, we might as well have a pint before we go, Joe. We might as well, Mick. Might as well be drunk as the way we are, Joe.\nThey laugh and the women behind them are teary eyed and red nosed.\nIn the pubs around the railway station the men are packed in drinking the money the agents gave them for travel food. They're having the last pint, the last drop of whiskey on Irish soil, For God knows it might be the last we'll ever have, Mick, the way the Jerries are bombing the bejesus outa England and not a minute too soon after what they did to us and isn't it a tragic thing entirely the way we have to go over there and save the arse of the ancient foe.\nThe women stay outside the pubs talking. Mam tells Mrs. Meehan, The first telegram money order I get I'll be in the shop buying a big breakfast so that we can all have our own egg of a Sunday morning.\nI look at my brother Malachy. Did you hear that? Our own egg of a Sunday morning. Oh, God, I already had plans for my egg. Tap it around the top, gently crack the shell, lift with a spoon, a dab of butter down into the yolk, salt, take my time, a dip of the spoon, scoop, more salt, more butter, into the mouth, oh, God above, if heaven has a taste it must be an egg with butter and salt, and after the egg is there anything in the world lovelier than fresh warm bread and a mug of sweet golden tea?\nSome men are already too drunk to walk and the English agents are paying sober men to drag them out of the pubs and throw them on a great horse drawn float to be hauled to the station and dumped into the train. The agents are desperate to get everyone out of the pubs. Come on, men. Miss this train and you'll miss a good job. Come on, men, we have the Guinness in England. We have the Jameson. Now, men, please, men. You're drinking your food money and you'll get no more.\nThe men tell the agents to kiss their Irish arses, that the agents are lucky they're alive, lucky they're not hanging from the nearest lamppost after what they did to Ireland. And the men sing, On Mountjoy one Monday morning High upon the gallows tree, Kevin Barry gave his young life For the cause of liberty.\nThe train wails in the station and the agents beg the women to get their men out of the pubs and the men stumble out singing and crying and hugging their wives and children and promising to send so much money Limerick will be turned into another New York. The men climb the station\nsteps and the women and children call after them, Kevin, love, mind yourself and don't be wearing damp shirts.\nDry your socks, Michael, or the bunions will destroy you entirely. Paddy, go easy on the drink, are you listenin', Paddy?\nDad, Dad, don't go, Dad.\nTommy, don't forget to send the money. The children are skin and\nbones.\nPeter, don't forget to be takin' the medicine for your weak chest,\nGod help us.\nLarry, mind them bloody bombs.\nChristy, don't be talkin' to them Englishwomen. They're full of\ndiseases.\nJackie, come back. Sure we'll manage somehow. Don't go, Jack-e-e,\nJack-e-e, oh, Jesus, don't go.\nDad pats our heads. He tells us remember our religious duties but,\nabove all, obey our mother. He stands before her. She has the baby Alphie in her arms. She says, Mind yourself. He drops the bag and puts his arms around her. They stay that way a moment till the baby yelps between them. He nods, picks up his bag, climbs the steps to the station, turns to wave and he's gone.\nBack at home Mam says, I don't care. I know it sounds extravagant but I'm going to light the fire and make more tea for it isn't every day your father goes to England.\nWe sit around the fire and drink our tea and cry because we have no father, till Mam says, Don't cry, don't cry. Now that your father is gone to England surely our troubles will be over.\nSurely.\nMam and Bridey Hannon sit by the fire upstairs in Italy smoking Woodbines, drinking tea, and I sit on the stairs listening. We have a father in England so that we can get all we want from Kathleen O'Connell's shop and pay when he starts sending the money in a fortnight. Mam tells Bridey she can't wait to get out of this bloody lane to a place with a decent lavatory that we don't have to share with half the world. We'll all have new boots and coats to keep off the rain so we won't be coming home from school famished. We'll have eggs and rashers on Sunday for breakfast and ham and cabbage and potatoes for dinner. We'll have electric light and why shouldn't we? Weren't Frank and Malachy born to it in America where everyone has it?\nAll we have to do now is wait for two weeks till the telegram boy knocks at the door. Dad will have to settle into his job in England, buy work clothes and get a place to stay, so the first money order won't be big, three pounds or three pounds ten, but soon we'll be like other families in the lane, five pounds a week, paying off debts, buying new clothes, putting something in the savings against the time we'll pack up and move to England entirely and save there to go to America. Mam herself could get a job in an English factory making bombs or something and God knows we wouldn't know ourselves with the money pouring in. She wouldn't be happy if we grew up with English accents but better an English accent than an empty belly.\nBridey says it doesn't matter what class of an accent an Irishman has for he'll never forget what the English did to us for eight hundred long years.\nWe know what Saturdays are in the lane. We know some families like the Downeses across from us get their telegram early because Mr. Downes\nis a steady man who knows how to have a pint or two on a Friday and go home to his bed. We know men like him run to the post office the minute they're paid so their families won't know a minute of waiting or worry. Men like Mr. Downes send their sons RAF wings to wear on their coats. That's what we want and that's what we told Dad before he left, Don't forget the RAF badges, Dad.\nWe see the telegram boys on their bicycles swing into the lane. They're happy telegram boys because the tips they get in the lanes are bigger than anything they get in the grand streets and avenues where rich people will begrudge you the steam of their piss.\nThe families that get the early telegrams have that contented look. They'll have all day Saturday to enjoy the money. They'll shop, they'll eat, they'll have all day to think about what they'll do that night and that's almost as good as the thing itself because Saturday night when you have a few shillings in your pocket is the most delicious night of the week.\nThere are families don't get the telegram every week and you know them by the anxious look. Mrs. Meagher has waited at her door every Saturday for two months. My mother says she'd be ashamed of her life to wait at the door like that. All the children play in the lane and keep an eye out for the telegram boy. Hoi, telegram boy, do you have anything for Meagher? and when he says no they say, Are you sure? and he'll say, Course I'm sure. I know what I have in my feckin' pouch.\nEveryone knows the telegram boys stop coming when the Angelus rings at six and darkness brings desperation to the women and children.\nTelegram boy, will you look in your pouch again? Please. Aw, God. I did. I have nothing for ye.\nAw, God, please look. Our name is Meagher. Will you look?\nI know bloody well yeer name is Meagher and I looked.\nThe children claw at him up on his bicycle and he kicks at them, Jesus, will ye get away from me.\nOnce the Angelus rings at six in the evening the day is over. The ones with the telegrams are having their supper with the electric light blazing away and the ones that didn't get the telegrams have to light candles and see if Kathleen O'Connell might let them have tea and bread till this time next week when surely with the help of God and His Blessed Mother the telegram will come.\nMr. Meehan at the top of the lane went to England with Dad and when the telegram boy stops at Meehan's we know we'll be next. Mam has her coat ready to go to the post office but she won't leave the chair by the fire in Italy till she has the telegram in her hand. The telegram boy rides down the lane and swings over to Downeses'. He hands them their telegram, takes the tip and turns his bicycle around to head back up the lane. Malachy calls, Telegram boy, do you have something for McCourt? Ours is coming today. The telegram boy shakes his head and rides away.\nMam puffs on her Woodbine. Well, we have all day though I'd like to do a bit of shopping early before the best hams are gone at Barry the butcher. She can't leave the fire and we can't leave the lane for fear the telegram boy might come and find no one at home. Then we'd have to wait till Monday to cash the money order and that would destroy the weekend entirely. We'd have to watch the Meehans and everyone else parading around in their new clothes and staggering home with eggs and potatoes and sausages for Sunday and sailing off to the films on Saturday night. No, we can't move an inch till that telegram boy comes. Mam says\ndon't be too worried between noon and two because so many telegram boys go for their dinner and there will surely be a big rush between two and the Angelus. We don't have a thing to worry about till six. We stop every telegram boy. We tell them our name is McCourt, that this is our first telegram, it should be three pounds or more, they might have forgotten to put our name on it or our address, is he sure? is he sure? One boy tells us he'll inquire at the post office. He says he knows what 'tis like to wait for the telegram because his own father is a drunken oul' shit over in England that never sent a penny. Mam hears him inside and tells us you should never talk about your father like that. The same telegram boy comes back just before the Angelus at six and tells us he asked Mrs. O'Connell at the post office if they had anything for McCourt all day and they didn't. Mam turns toward the dead ashes in the fire and sucks at the last bit of goodness in the Woodbine butt caught between the brown thumb and the burnt middle finger. Michael who is only five and won't understand anything till he's eleven like me wants to know if we're having fish and chips tonight because he's hungry. Mam says, Next week, love, and he goes back out to play in the lane.\nYou don't know what to do with yourself when the first telegram doesn't come. You can't stay out in the lane playing with your brothers all night because everyone else is gone in and you'd be ashamed to stay out in the lane to be tormented with smells of sausages and rashers and fried bread. You don't want to look at electric light coming through the windows after dark and you don't want to hear the news from the BBC or Radio Eireann from other people's wirelesses. Mrs. Meagher and her children are gone in and there's only the dim light of a candle from their kitchen. They're ashamed too. They stay inside on Saturday nights and they don't even go to Mass on Sunday mornings. Bridey Hannon told Mam that Mrs. Meagher is in a constant state of shame over the rags they wear and so desperate she goes down to the Dispensary for the public assistance. Mam says that's the worst thing that could happen to any family. It's worse than going on the dole, it's worse than going to the St. Vincent de Paul Society, it's worse than begging on the streets with the tinkers and the knackers. It's the last thing you'd do to keep yourself out of the poor house and the children from the orphanage.\nThere's a sore at the top of my nose between my eyebrows, gray and red and itching. Grandma says, Don't touch that sore and don't put water near it or it'll spread. If you broke your arm she'd say don't touch that with water it'll spread. The sore spreads into my eyes anyway and now they're red and yellow from the stuff that oozes and makes them stick in the morning. They stick so hard I have to force my eyelids open with my fingers and Mam has to scrub off that yellow stuff with a damp rag and boric powder. The eyelashes fall off and every bit of dust in Limerick blows into my eyes on windy days. Grandma tells me I have naked eyes and she says it's my own fault, all that eye trouble comes from sitting up there at the top of the lane under the light pole in all kinds of weather with my nose stuck in books and the same thing will happen to Malachy if he doesn't give over with the reading. You can see little Michael is getting just as bad sticking his nose in books when he should be out playing like a healthy child. Books, books, books, says Grandma, ye will ruin yeer eyes entirely.\nShe's having tea with Mam and I hear her whisper, The thing to do is give him St. Anthony's spit.\nWhat's that? says Mam.\nYour fasting spit in the morning. Go to him before he wakes and spit on his eyes for the spit of a fasting mother has powerful cures in\nit.\nBut I'm always awake before Mam. I force my eyes open long before\nshe stirs. I can hear her coming across the floor and when she stands over me for the spit I open my eyes. God, she says, your eyes are open.\nI think they're getting better.\nThat's good, and she goes back to bed.\nThe eyes don't heal and she takes me to the Dispensary where the\npoor people see doctors and get their medicines. It's the place to apply for public assistance when a father is dead or disappeared and there's no dole money, no wages.\nThere are benches along the walls by the doctors' offices. The benches are always packed with people talking about their ailments. Old men and women sit and groan and babies scream and mothers say hush, love, hush. There's a high platform in the middle of the Dispensary with a counter circling it chest high. When you want anything you stand in a queue before that platform to see Mr. Coffey or Mr. Kane. The women in the queue are like the women at the St. Vincent de Paul Society. They wear shawls and they're respectful to Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane because if they're not they might be told go away and come back next week when it's this minute you need the public assistance or a docket to see the doctor. Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane love to have a good laugh with the women. They'll decide if you're desperate enough for the public assistance or if you're sick enough to see a doctor. You have to tell them in front of everyone what's wrong with you and they often have a good laugh with that. They'll say, And what is it you want, Mrs. O'Shea? A docket for the doctor, is it? And what is your trouble, Mrs. O'Shea? A pain, is it? A touch of the wind, maybe. Or maybe too much cabbage. Oh, the cabbage will do it right enough. They laugh and Mrs. O'Shea laughs and all the women laugh and say Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane are funny men, they'd give Laurel and Hardy a run for their money.\nMr. Coffey says, Now, woman, what's your name? Angela McCourt, sir.\nAnd what's up with you?\n'Tis my son, sir. He has two bad eyes.\nOh, by God, he does, woman. They're desperate looking eyes altogether. They look like two rising suns. The Japs could use him on their flag, ha ha ha. Did he pour acid on his face or what?\n'Tis some class of infection, sir. He had the typhoid last year and then this came.\nAll right, all right, we don't need the life story. Here's your docket to Dr. Troy.\nTwo long benches are filled with patients for Dr. Troy. Mam sits next to a woman who has a big sore on her nose that won't go away. I tried everything, missus, every known cure on God's lovely earth. I'm eighty-three years of age and I'd like to go to my grave healthy. Is it too much to ask that I meet my Redeemer with a healthy nose? And what's up with yourself, missus?\nMy son. The eyes.\nAh, God bless us and save us, look at them eyes. They're the sorest two eyes I ever seen in me life. I never seen that color red before.\n'Tis an infection, missus.\nSure there's a cure for that. You need the caul.\nWhat's that now?\nBabies are born with this thing on their heads, a class of a hood, rare and magical. Get a caul and put that on his head any day that has a three in it, make him hold his breath for three minutes even if you have to clap your hand over his face, sprinkle him with holy water three times head to toenail and his two eyes will shine in the dawn.\nAnd where would I get a caul?\nDon't all the midwives have cauls, missus. What's a midwife without a caul? It cures all classes of disease and keeps off more.\nMam says she'll talk to Nurse O'Halloran and see if she has a spare caul.\nDr. Troy looks at my eyes. Into the hospital with this boy at once. Take him to the eye ward at the City Home. Here's the docket to get him\nin.\nWhat does he have, Doctor?\nThe worst case of conjunctivitis I've ever seen in my life and\nsomething else in there I can't make out. He needs the eye man.\nHow long will he be in, Doctor?\nOnly God knows that. I should have seen this child weeks ago. There are twenty beds in the ward and there are men and boys with\nbandages around their heads, black patches on their eyes, thick glasses. Some walk around tapping at beds with sticks. A man cries all the time that he'll never see again, he's too young, his children are babies, he'll never see them again. Jesus Christ, oh, Jesus Christ, and the nuns are shocked at the way he takes the name of the Lord in vain. Stop that, Maurice, stop the blasphemy. You have your health. You're alive. We all have our problems. Offer it up and think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the nails in His poor hands and feet, the wound in His side. Maurice says, Oh, Jesus, look down and have pity on me. Sister Bernadette warns him if he doesn't mind his language they'll put him in a ward alone and he says, Heavenly God, and that isn't as bad as Jesus Christ so she's satisfied.\nIn the morning I have to go downstairs for drops. The nurse says, Sit in this high chair and here's a nice sweet. The doctor has a bottle with brown stuff in it. He tells me put my head back, that's right, now open up, open your eyes and he pours the stuff into my right eye and it's a flame going through my skull. The nurse says, Open the other eye, come on be a good boy, and she has to force the eyelids open so the doctor can set fire to the other side of my skull. She wipes my cheeks and tells me run along upstairs but I can barely see and I want to stick my face into an icy stream. The doctor says, Run along, be a man, be a good trooper.\nThe whole world is brown and blurry on the stairs. The other patients are sitting by their beds with dinner trays and mine is there too but I don't want it with the way my skull is raging. I sit by my bed and a boy across the way says, Hoi, don't you want your dinner? I'll take it, and he comes for it.\nI try to lie on the bed but a nurse says, Now, now, no lying on the bed in the middle of the day. Your case isn't that serious.\nI have to sit with my eyes closed and everything going brown and black, black and brown and I'm sure I must be having a dream because Lord God above, is that the little fella with the typhoid, little Frankie, the moon was a ghostly galleon tossed upon cloudy seas, is that yourself, Frankie, for wasn't I promoted out of the Fever Hospital, thank God, where there's every class of disease and you never know what germs you\nmight be bringing home to the wife in your clothes and what's up with you, Frankie, and the two eyes in your head all gone brown?\nI have an infection, Seamus.\nYerra, you'll be over that before you're married, Frankie. The eyes need exercise. The blink is great value for the eyes. I had an uncle with bad eyes and the blink saved him. He sat an hour ever day and blinked and it stood to him in the end. Wound up with powerful eyes, so he did.\nI want to ask him more about the blink and the powerful eyes but he says, Now do you remember the poem, Frankie, the lovely poem of Patricia? He stands in the aisle between the beds with his mop and his bucket\nand says the highwayman poem and all the patients stop their moaning and the nuns and nurses stand and listen and on and on goes Seamus till he comes to the end and everyone goes mad clapping and cheering him and he tells the world he loves that poem he'll have it in his head forever no matter where he goes and if it wasn't for Frankie McCourt and his typhoid there and poor Patricia Madigan with the dipteria that's gone God rest her he'd never know the poem and there I am famous in the eye ward of the City Home Hospital and all because of Seamus.\nMam can't come to visit every day, it's a long way out, she doesn't always have the money for the bus and the walk is hard on her corns. She thinks my eyes look better though you can't tell with all that brown stuff, which looks and smells like iodine and if it's anything like iodine it must burn. Still, they say the bitterer the medicine the quicker the cure. She gets permission to take me for a walk around the grounds when the weather clears and there's a strange sight, Mr. Timoney standing against the wall where the old people are with his eyes raised to the sky. I want to talk to him and I have to ask Mam because you never know what's right or wrong in a hospital.\nMr. Timoney.\nWho is it? Who do we have?\nFrank McCourt, sir.\nFrancis, ah, Francis.\nMam says, I'm his mother, Mr. Timoney.\nWell, then, the two of ye are blessed. I have neither kith nor kin\nnor Macushla my dog. And what are you doing in this place, Francis?\nI have an infection in my eyes.\nAh, Jesus, Francis, not the eyes, not the eyes. Mother of Christ,\nyou're too young for that.\nMr. Timoney, would you like me to read to you?\nWith them eyes, Francis? Ah, no, son, Save the eyes. I'm beyond\nreading. In my head I have everything I need. I was smart enough to put things in my head in my youth and now I have a library in my head. The English shot my wife. The Irish put down my poor innocent Macushla. Isn't it a joke of a world?\nMam says, Terrible world but God is good.\nIndeed, missus. God made the world, it's a terrible world, but God is good. Good-bye, Francis. Rest your eyes and then read till they fall out of your head. We had good times with old Jonathan Swift, didn't we, Francis?\nWe did, Mr. Timoney.\nMam takes me back to the eye ward. She tells me, Don't be crying over Mr. Timoney, he's not even your father. Besides you'll be ruining your eyes.\nSeamus comes to the ward three times a week and brings new poems in his head. He says, You made Patricia sad, Frankie, when you didn't like the one about the owl and the pussycat.\nI'm sorry, Seamus.\nI have it in my head, Frankie, and I'll say it for you if you don't say 'tis foolish.\nI won't, Seamus.\nHe says the poem and everyone in the ward loves it. They want the words and he says it three more times till the whole ward is saying, The Owl and the Pussy cat went to sea In a beautiful pea-green boat.\nThey took some honey, and plenty of money Wrapped up in a five-pound note.\nThe Owl looked up to the stars above,\nAnd sang to a small guitar,\nO lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love,\nWhat a beautiful Pussy you are,\nYou are,\nYou are.\nWhat a beautiful Pussy you are.\nThey say it along with Seamus now and when it's finished they cheer and clap and Seamus laughs, delighted with himself. When he's gone with his mop and bucket you can hear them at all hours of the day and night O lovely Pussy, O Pussy, my love, What a beautiful Pussy you are, You are, You are.\nWhat a beautiful Pussy you are.\nThen Seamus comes with no mop and no bucket and I'm afraid he's sacked over the poetry but he's smiling and telling me he's off to England to work in a factory and earn decent wages for a change. He'll work for two months and bring the wife over and God might be pleased to send them children for he has to do something with all the poems in his head and what better than saying them to small ones in memory of that sweet Patricia Madigan dead of the dipteria.\nGood-bye, Francis. If I had the right fist I'd write to you but I'll get the wife to write when she comes over. I might even learn to read and write myself so that the child that comes won't have a fool for a father.\nI want to cry but you can't cry in the eye ward with brown stuff in your eyes and nurses saying, What's this what's this be a man, and nuns going on, Offer it up, think of the sufferings of Our Lord on the cross, the crown of thorns, the lance in the side, the hands and feet torn to bits with nails.\nI'm a month in the hospital and the doctor says I can go home even if there's still a bit of infection but if I keep the eyes clean with soap and clean towels and build up my health with nourishing food plenty of beef and eggs I'll have a pair of sparkling eyes in no time ha ha.\nMr. Downes across the way comes back from England for his mother's funeral. He tells Mrs. Downes about my father. She tells Bridey Hannon and Bridey tells my mother. Mr. Downes says that Malachy McCourt is gone pure mad with the drink, that he squanders his wages in pubs all over Coventry, that he sings Irish rebel songs which the English don't mind because they're used to the way the Irish carry on about the hundreds of years of suffering, but they won't put up with any man that stands up in\na pub and insults the King and Queen of England, their two lovely daughters and the Queen Mother herself. Insulting the Queen Mother is going beyond the beyonds. What did she ever do to anyone, that poor old lady? Time after time Malachy drinks away his rent money and winds up sleeping in parks when the landlord throws him out. He's a regular disgrace, so he is, and Mr. Downes is glad McCourt is not a Limerickman bringing shame to this ancient city. The magistrates in Coventry are losing their patience and if Malachy McCourt doesn't stop the bloody nonsense he'll be kicked out of the country entirely.\nMam tells Bridey she doesn't know what she's going to do with these stories from England, she never felt so desperate in her life. She can see Kathleen O'Connell doesn't want to give any more credit at the shop and her own mother barks at her if she asks for the loan of a shilling and the St. Vincent de Paul Society want to know when she'll stop asking for charity especially with a husband in England. She's ashamed of the way we look with the dirty old torn shirts, raggedy ganseys, broken shoes, holes in our stockings. She lies awake at night thinking the most merciful thing of all would be to put the four boys in an orphanage so that she could go to England herself and find some type of work where she could bring us all over in a year for the better life. There might be bombs but she'd prefer bombs anytime to the shame of begging from this one and that one.\nNo, no matter what she can't bear the thought of putting us in the orphanage. That might be all right if you had the likes of Boys' Town in America with a nice priest like Spencer Tracy but you could never trust the Christian Brothers out in Glin who get their exercise beating boys and starving the life out of them.\nMam says there's nothing left but the Dispensary and the public assistance, the relief, and she's ashamed of her life to go and ask for it. It means you're at the end of your rope and maybe one level above tinkers, knackers and street beggars in general. It means you have to crawl before Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane and thank God the Dispensary is at the other end of Limerick so that people in our lane won't know we're getting the relief.\nShe knows from other women it's wise to be there early in the morning when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane might be in a good mood. If you go late in the morning they're liable to be cranky after seeing hundreds of men women and children sick and asking for help. She will take us with her to prove she has four children to feed. She gets us up early and tells us for once in our lives don't wash our faces, don't comb our hair, dress in any old rag. She tells me give my sore eyes a good rub and make them as red as I can for the worse you look at the Dispensary the more pity you get and the better your chances of getting the public assistance. She complains that Malachy Michael and Alphie look too healthy and you'd wonder why on this day of days they couldn't have their usual scabby knees or the odd cut bruise or black eye. If we meet anyone in the lane or the streets of Limerick we are not to tell them where we're going. She feels ashamed enough without telling the whole world and wait till her own mother hears.\nThere is a queue already outside the Dispensary. There are women like Mam with children in their arms, babies like Alphie, and children playing on the pavement. The women comfort the babies against the cold and scream at the ones playing in case they run into the street and get hit by a motor car or a bicycle. There are old men and women huddled\nagainst the wall talking to themselves or not talking at all. Mam warns us not to wander from her and we wait half an hour for the big door to open. A man tells us move inside in proper order and queue up before the platform, that Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane will be there in a minute when they finish their tea in the room beyond. A woman complains her children are freezing with the cold and couldn't Coffey and Kane bloody well hurry up with their tea. The man says she's a troublemaker but he won't take her name this time with the cold that's in the morning but if there's another word she'll be a sorry woman.\nMr. Coffey and Mr. Kane get up on the platform and pay no attention to the people. Mr. Kane puts on his glasses, takes them off, polishes them, puts them on, looks at the ceiling. Mr. Coffey reads papers, writes something, passes papers to Mr. Kane. They whisper to each other. They take their time. They don't look at us.\nThen Mr. Kane calls the first old man to the platform. What's your\nname?\nTimothy Creagh, sir.\nCreagh, hah? A fine old Limerick name you have there.\nI do, sir. Indeed I do.\nAnd what do you want, Creagh?\nAh, sure, I do be havin' them pains in me stomach again an' I'd\nlike to see Dr. Feeley.\nWell, now, Creagh, are you sure it's not the pints of porter that\nare going against your stomach.\nAh, no, indeed, sir. Sure I hardly touch the pint at all with the\npains. My wife is home in the bed and I have to take care of her too. There's great laziness in the world, Creagh. And Mr. Kane says to\nthe people on the queue, Did ye hear that, ladies? Great laziness, isn't there?\nAnd the women say, Oh, there is, indeed, Mr. Kane, great laziness. Mr. Creagh gets his docket to see the doctor, the queue moves ahead\nand Mr. Kane is ready for Mam.\nThe public assistance, is\n'Tis, Mr. Kane.\nAnd where's your husband?\nOh, he's in England, but-\nEngland, is it? And where\nthat what you want, woman, the relief?\nis the weekly telegram, the big five\npounds?\nHe didn't send us a penny in months, Mr. Kane.\nIs that a fact? Well, we know why, don't we? We know what the men\nof Ireland are up to in England. We know there's the occasional Limerickman seen trotting around with a Piccadilly tart, don't we?\nHe looks out at the people on the queue and they know they're supposed to say, We do, Mr. Kane, and they know they're supposed to smile and laugh or things will go hard with them when they reach the platform. They know he might turn them over to Mr. Coffey and he's notorious for saying no to everything.\nMam tells Mr. Kane that Dad is in Coventry and nowhere near Piccadilly and Mr. Kane takes off his glasses and stares at her. What's this? Are we having a little contradiction here?\nOh, no, Mr. Kane, God no.\nI want you to know, woman, that it is the policy here to give no relief to women with husbands in England. I want you to know you're\ntaking the bread from the mouths of more deserving people who stayed in this country to do their bit.\nOh, yes, Mr. Kane.\nAnd what's your name?\nMcCourt, sir.\nThat's not a Limerick name. Where did you get a name like that? My husband, sir. He's from the North.\nHe's from the North and he leaves you here to get the relief from\nthe Irish Free State. Is this what we fought for, is it? I don't know, sir.\nWhy don't you go up to Belfast and see what the Orangemen will do for you, ah?\nI don't know, sir.\nYou don't know. Of course you don't know. There's great ignorance in the world.\nHe looks out at the people, I said there's great ignorance in the world, and the people nod their heads and agree there's great ignorance in the world.\nHe whispers to Mr. Coffey and they look at Mam, they look at us. He tells Mam at last that she can have the public assistance but if she gets a single penny from her husband she's to drop all claims and give the money back to the Dispensary. She promises she will and we leave.\nWe follow her to Kathleen O'Connell's shop to get tea and bread and a few sods of turf for the fire. We climb the stairs to Italy and get the fire going and it's cozy when we have our tea. We're all very quiet, even the baby Alphie, because we know what Mr. Kane did to our mother.\nX\nIt's cold and wet down in Ireland but we're up in Italy. Mam says we should bring the poor Pope up to hang on the wall opposite the window. After all he's a friend of the workingman, he's Italian, and they're a warm weather people. Mam sits by the fire, shivering, and we know something is wrong when she makes no move for a cigarette. She says she feels a cold coming and she'd love to have a tarty drink, a lemonade. But there's no money in the house, not even for bread in the morning. She drinks tea and goes to bed.\nThe bed creaks all night with her twistings and turnings and she keeps us awake with her moaning for water. In the morning, she stays in bed, still shivering, and we keep quiet. If she sleeps long enough Malachy and I will be too late for school. Hours pass and still she makes no move and when I know it's well past school time I start the fire for the kettle. She stirs and calls for lemonade but I give her a jam jar of water. I ask her if she'd like some tea and she acts like a woman gone deaf. She looks flushed and it's odd she doesn't even mention cigarettes.\nWe sit quietly by the fire, Malachy, Michael, Alphie, myself. We drink our tea while Alphie chews the last bit of bread covered with sugar. He makes us laugh the way he smears the sugar all over his face and grins at us with his fat sticky cheeks. But we can't laugh too much or Mam will jump out of the bed and order Malachy and me off to school where we'll be killed for being late. We don't laugh long, there is no more bread and we're hungry, the four of us. We can get no more credit at\nO'Connell's shop. We can't go near Grandma, either. She yells at us all the time because Dad is from the North and he never sends money home from England where he is working in a munitions factory. Grandma says we could starve to death for all he cares. That would teach Mam a lesson for marrying a man from the North with sallow skin, an odd manner and a look of the Presbyterian about him.\nStill, I'll have to try Kathleen O'Connell once more. I'll tell her my mother is sick above in the bed, my brothers are starving and we'll all be dead for the want of bread.\nI put on my shoes and run quickly through the streets of Limerick to keep myself warm against the February frost. You can look in people's windows and see how cozy it is in their kitchens with fires glowing or ranges black and hot everything bright in the electric light cups and saucers on the tables with plates of sliced bread pounds of butter jars of jam smells of fried eggs and rashers coming through the windows enough to make the water run in your mouth and families sitting there digging in all smiling the mother crisp and clean in her apron everyone washed and the Sacred Heart of Jesus looking down on them from the wall suffering and sad but still happy with all that food and light and good Catholics at their breakfast.\nI try to find music in my own head but all I can find is my mother moaning for lemonade.\nLemonade. There's a van pulling away from South's pub leaving crates of beer and lemonade outside and there isn't a soul on the street. In a second I have two bottles of lemonade up under my jersey and I saunter away trying to look innocent.\nThere's a bread van outside Kathleen O'Connell's shop. The back door is open on shelves of steaming newly baked bread. The van driver is inside the shop having tea and a bun with Kathleen and it's no trouble for me to help myself to a loaf of bread. It's wrong to steal from Kathleen with the way she's always good to us but if I go in and ask her for bread she'll be annoyed and tell me I'm ruining her morning cup of tea, which she'd like to have in peace ease and comfort thank you. It's easier to stick the bread up under my jersey with the lemonade and promise to tell everything in confession.\nMy brothers are back in bed playing games under the overcoats but they jump when they see the bread. We tear at the loaf because we're too hungry to slice it and we make tea from this morning's leaves. When my mother stirs Malachy holds the lemonade bottle to her lips and she gasps till she finishes it. If she likes it that much I'll have to find more lemonade.\nWe put the last of the coal on the fire and sit around telling stories which we make up the way Dad did. I tell my brothers about my adventures with the lemonade and bread and I make up stories about how I was chased by pub owners and shopkeepers and how I ran into St. Joseph's Church where no one can follow you if you're a criminal, not even if you killed your own mother. Malachy and Michael look shocked over the way I got the bread and lemonade but then Malachy says it was only what Robin Hood would have done, rob the rich and give to the poor. Michael says I'm an outlaw and if they catch me they'll hang me from the highest tree in the People's Park the way outlaws are hanged in films at the Lyric Cinema. Malachy says I should make sure I'm in a state of grace because it might be hard to find a priest to come to my hanging. I tell him a priest would have to come to the hanging. That's what priests are for.\nRoddy McCorley had a priest and so did Kevin Barry. Malachy says there were no priests at the hanging of Roddy McCorley and Kevin Barry because they're not mentioned in the songs and he starts singing the songs to prove it till my mother groans in the bed and says shut up.\nAlphie the baby is asleep on the floor by the fire. We put him into the bed with Mam so that he'll be warm though we don't want him to catch her disease and die. If she wakes up and finds him dead in the bed beside her there will be no end to the lamentations and she'll blame me on top of it.\nThe three of us get back into our own bed, huddling under the overcoats and trying not to roll into the hole in the mattress. It's pleasant there till Michael starts to worry over Alphie getting Mam's disease and me getting hanged for an outlaw. He says it isn't fair because that would leave him with only one brother and everyone in the world has brothers galore. He falls asleep from the worry and soon Malachy drifts off and I lie there thinking of jam. Wouldn't it be lovely to have another loaf of bread and a jar of strawberry jam or any kind of jam. I can't remember ever seeing a jam van making a delivery and I wouldn't want to be like Jesse James blasting my way into a shop demanding jam. That would surely lead to a hanging.\nThere's a cold sun coming through the window and I'm sure it must be warmer outside and wouldn't my brothers be surprised if they woke and found me there with more bread and jam. They'd gobble everything and then go on about my sins and the hanging.\nMam is still asleep though her face is red and there's a strangling sound when she snores.\nI have to be careful going through the street because it's a school day and if Guard Dennehy sees me he'll drag me off to school and Mr. O'Halloran will knock me all over the classroom. The guard is in charge of school attendance and he loves chasing you on his bicycle and dragging you off to school by the ear.\nThere's a box sitting outside the door of one of the big houses on Barrington Street. I pretend to knock on the door so that I can see what's in the box, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, cheese, tomatoes and, oh, God, a jar of marmalade. I can't shove all that under my jersey. Oh, God. Should I take the whole box? The people passing by pay me no attention. I might as well take the whole box. My mother would say you might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. I lift the box and try to look like a messenger boy making a delivery and no one says a word.\nMalachy and Michael are beside themselves when they see what's in the box and they're soon gobbling thick cuts of bread slathered with golden marmalade. Alphie has the marmalade all over his face and hair and a good bit on his legs and belly. We wash down the food with cold tea because we have no fire to heat it.\nMam mumbles again for lemonade and I give her half the second bottle to keep her quiet. She calls for more and I mix it with water to stretch it because I can't be spending my life running around lifting lemonade from pubs. We're having a fine time of it till Mam begins to rave in the bed about her lovely little daughter taken from her and her twin boys gone before they were three and why couldn't God take the rich for a change and is there any lemonade in the house? Michael wants to know if Mam will die and Malachy tells him you can't die till a priest comes. Then Michael wonders if we'll ever have a fire and hot tea again because he's freezing in the bed even with the overcoats left over from\nolden times. Malachy says we should go from house to house asking for turf and coal and wood and we could use Alphie's pram to carry the load. We should take Alphie with us because he's small and he smiles and people will see him and feel sorry for him and us. We try to wash all the dirt and lint and feathers and sticky marmalade but when we touch him with water he howls. Michael says he'll only get dirty again in the pram so what's the use of washing him. Michael is small but he's always saying remarkable things like that.\nWe push the pram out to the rich avenues and roads but when we knock on the doors the maids tell us go away or they'll call the proper authorities and it's a disgrace to be dragging a baby around in a wreck of a pram that smells to the heavens a filthy contraption that you wouldn't use to haul a pig to the slaughterhouse and this is a Catholic country where babies should be cherished and kept alive to hand down the faith from generation to generation. Malachy tells one maid to kiss his arse and she gives him such a clout the tears leap to his eyes and he says he'll never in his life ask the rich for anything again. He says there's no use asking anymore, that we should go around the backs of the houses and climb over the walls and take what we want. Michael can ring the front doorbells to keep the maids busy and Malachy and I can throw coal and turf over the walls and fill the pram all around Alphie.\nWe collect that way from three houses but then Malachy throws a piece of coal over a wall and hits Alphie and he starts screaming and we have to run forgetting Michael, still ringing doorbells and getting abuse from maids. Malachy says we should take the pram home first and then go back for Michael. We can't stop now with Alphie bawling and people giving us dirty looks and telling us we're a disgrace to our mother and Ireland in general.\nWhen we're back home it takes a while to dig Alphie out from under the load of coal and turf and he won't stop screaming till I give him bread and marmalade. I'm afraid Mam will leap from her bed but she only mumbles on about Dad and drink and babies dead.\nMalachy is back with Michael, with stories of his adventures ringing doorbells. One rich woman answered the door herself and invited him into the kitchen for cake and milk and bread and jam. She asked him all about his family and he told her his father had a big job in England but his mother is in the bed with a desperate disease and calling for lemonade morning noon and night. The rich woman wanted to know who was taking care of us and Michael bragged we were taking care of ourselves, that there was no shortage of bread and marmalade. The rich woman wrote down Michael's name and address and told him be a good boy and go home to his brothers and his mother in the bed.\nMalachy barks at Michael for being such a fool as to tell a rich woman anything. She'll go now and tell on us and before we know it we'll have the priests of the world banging on the door and disturbing us.\nThere's the banging on the door already. But it isn't a priest, it's Guard Dennehy. He calls up, Hello, hello, is anybody home? Are you there, Mrs. McCourt?\nMichael knocks on the window and waves at the guard. I give him a good kick for himself and Malachy thumps him on the head and he yells, I'll tell the guard. I'll tell the guard. They're killing me, guard. They're thumping and kicking.\nHe won't shut up and Guard Dennehy shouts at us to open the door. I call out the window and tell him I can't open the door because my mother is in bed with a terrible disease.\nWhere's your father?\nHe's in England.\nWell, I'm coming in to talk to your mother.\nYou can't. You can't. She has the disease. We all have the disease.\nIt might be the typhoid. It might be the galloping consumption. We're getting spots already. The baby has a lump. It could kill.\nHe pushes in the door and climbs the stairs to Italy just as Alphie crawls out from under the bed covered with marmalade and dirt. He looks at him and my mother and us, takes off his cap and scratches his head. He says, Jesus, Mary and Joseph, this is a desperate situation. How did your mother get sick like that?\nI tell him he shouldn't go near her and when Malachy says we might not be able to go to school for ages the guard says we'll go to school no matter what, that we're on the earth to go to school the way he's on the earth to make sure we go to school. He wants to know if we have any relations and he sends me off to tell Grandma and Aunt Aggie to come to our house.\nThey scream at me and tell me I'm filthy. I try to explain that Mam has the disease and I'm worn out trying to make ends meet, keeping the home fires burning, getting lemonade for Mam and bread for my brothers. There's no use telling them about the marmalade for they'll only scream again. There's no use telling them about the nastiness of rich people and their maids.\nThey push me all the way back to the lane, barking at me and disgracing me on the streets of Limerick. Guard Dennehy is still scratching his poll. He says, Look at this, a disgrace. You wouldn't see the likes of this in Bombay or the Bowery of New York itself.\nGrandma is wailing at my mother, Mother o' God, Angela, what's up with you in the bed? What did they do to you?\nMy mother runs her tongue over her dry lips and gasps for more lemonade.\nShe wants lemonade, says Michael, and we got it for her and bread and marmalade and we're all outlaws now. Frankie was the first outlaw till we went raiding for coal all over Limerick.\nGuard Dennehy looks interested and takes Michael downstairs by the hand and in a few minutes we hear him laughing. Aunt Aggie says that's a disgraceful way to behave with my mother sick in the bed. The guard comes back and tells her go for a doctor. He keeps covering his face with his cap whenever he looks at me or my brothers. Desperadoes, he says, desperadoes.\nThe doctor comes with Aunt Aggie in his motor car and he has to rush my mother to the hospital with her pneumonia. We'd all like to go riding in the doctor's car but Aunt Aggie says, No, ye are all coming to my house till yeer mother comes home from the hospital.\nI tell her not to bother. I'm eleven and I can easily look after my brothers. I'd be glad to stay at home from school and make sure everyone is fed and washed. But Grandma screams I will do no such a thing and Aunt Aggie gives me a thump for myself. Guard Dennehy says I'm too young yet to be an outlaw and a father but I have a promising future in both departments.\nGet your clothes, says Aunt Aggie, ye are coming to my house till yeer mother is out of the hospital. Jesus above, that baby is a disgrace.\nShe finds a rag and ties it around Alphie's bottom for fear he might shit all over the pram. Then she looks at us and wants to know why we're standing there with our faces hanging out after she told us get our clothes. I'm afraid she'll hit me or yell at me when I tell her it's all right, we have our clothes, they're on us. She stares at me and shakes her head. Here, she says, put some sugar and water in the child's bottle. She tells me I have to push Alphie through the streets, she can't manage the pram with that bockety wheel that makes it rock back and forth and besides 'tis a disgraceful looking object she'd be ashamed to put a mangy dog in. She takes the three old coats from our bed and piles them on the pram till you can hardly see Alphie at all.\nGrandma comes with us and barks at me all the way from Roden Lane to Aunt Aggie's flat in Windmill Street. Can't you push that pram properly? Jesus, you're going to kill that child. Stop goin' from side to side or I'll give you a good clitther on the gob. She won't come into Aunt Aggie's flat. She can't stand the sight of us one more minute. She's fed up with the whole McCourt clan from the days when she had to send six fares to bring us all back from America, dishing out more money for funerals for dead children, giving us food every time our father drank the dole or the wages, helping Angela carry on while that blaguard from the North drinks his wages all over England. Oh, she's fed up, so she is, and off she goes across Henry Street with her black shawl pulled up around her white head, limping along in her black high laced boots.\nWhen you're eleven and your brothers are ten, five and one, you don't know what to do when you go to someone's house even if she's your mother's sister. You're told to leave the pram in the hall and bring the baby into the kitchen but if it's not your house you don't know what to do once you get into the kitchen for fear the aunt will yell at you or hit you on the skull. She takes off her coat and takes it to the bedroom and you stand with the baby in your arms waiting to be told. If you take one step forward or one step to the side she might come out and say where are you going and you don't know what to answer because you don't know yourself. If you say anything to your brothers she might say who do you think you're talking to in my kitchen? We have to stand and be quiet and that's hard when there's a tinkling sound from the bedroom and we know she's on the chamber pot peeing away. I don't want to look at Malachy. If I do I'll smile and he'll smile and Michael will smile and there's danger we'll start laughing and if we do we won't be able to stop for days at the picture in our heads of Aunt Aggie's big white bum perched on a flowery little chamber pot. I'm able to control myself. I won't laugh. Malachy and Michael won't laugh and it's easy to see we're all proud of ourselves for not laughing and getting into trouble with Aunt Aggie till Alphie in my arms smiles and says Goo goo and that sets us off. The three of us burst out laughing and Alphie grins with his dirty face and says Goo goo again till we're helpless and Aunt Aggie roars out of the room pulling her dress down and gives me a thump on the head that sends me against the wall baby and all. She hits Malachy too and she tries to hit Michael but he runs to the other side of her round table and she can't get at him. Come over here, she says, and I'll wipe that grin off your puss, but Michael keeps running around the table and she's too fat to catch him. I'll get you later, she says, I'll warm your arse, and you, Lord Muck, she says to me, put that child down on the floor over there by\nthe range. She puts the old coats from the pram on the floor and Alphie lies there with his sugary water and says Goo goo and smiles. She tells us take off every scrap of our clothes, get out to the tap in the backyard and scrub every inch of our bodies. We are not to come back into this house till we're spotless. I want to tell her it's the middle of February, it's freezing outside, we could all die, but I know if I open my mouth I might die right here on the kitchen floor.\nWe're out in the yard naked dousing ourselves with icy water from the tap. She opens the kitchen window and throws out a scrub brush and a big bar of brown soap like the one they used on Finn the Horse. She orders us to scrub each other's backs and don't stop till she tells us. Michael says his hands and feet are falling off with the cold but she doesn't care. She keeps telling us we're still dirty and if she has to come out to scrub us we'll rue the day. Another rue. I scrub myself harder. We all scrub till we're pink and our jaws chatter. It's not enough for Aunt Aggie. She comes out with a bucket and sloshes cold water all over us. Now, she says, get inside and dry yeerselves. We stand in the little shed next to her kitchen drying ourselves with one towel. We stand and shiver and wait because you can't go marching into her kitchen till she tells you. We hear her inside starting the fire, rattling the poker in the range, then yelling at us, Are ye goin' to stand in there all day? Come in here and put on yeer clothes.\nShe gives us mugs of tea and cuts of fried bread and we sit at the table eating quietly because you're not supposed to say a word unless she tells you. Michael asks her for a second cut of fried bread and we expect her to knock him off the chair for his cheek but she just grumbles, 'Tis far from two cuts of fried bread ye were brought up, and gives each of us another cut. She tries to feed Alphie bread soaked in tea but he won't eat it till she sprinkles it with sugar and when he's finished he smiles and pees all over her lap and we're delighted. She runs out to the shed to dab at herself with a towel and we're able to grin at each other at the table and tell Alphie he's the champion baby in the world. Uncle Pa Keating comes in the door all black from his job at the gas works. Oh, bejay, he says, what's this?\nMichael says, My mother is in the hospital, Uncle Pa. Is that so? What's up with her?\nPneumonia, says Malachy.\nWell, now, that's better than oldmonia.\nWe don't know what he's laughing at and Aunt Aggie comes in from the shed and tells him how Mam is in the hospital and we're to stay with them till she gets out. He says, Grand, grand, and goes to the shed to wash himself though when he comes back you'd never know he touched himself with water at all he's that black.\nHe sits at the table and Aunt Aggie gives him his supper, which is fried bread and ham and sliced tomatoes. She tells us get away from the table and stop gawking at him having his tea and tells him to stop giving us bits of ham and tomato. He says, Arrah, for Jaysus sake, Aggie, the children are hungry, and she says, 'Tis none of your business. They're not yours. She tells us go out and play and be home for bed by half-past eight. We know it's freezing outside and we'd like to stay in by that warm range but it's easier to be in the streets playing than inside with Aunt Aggie and her nagging.\nShe calls me in later and sends me upstairs to borrow a rubber sheet from a woman who had a child that died. The woman says tell your\naunt I'd like that rubber sheet back for the next child. Aunt Aggie says, Twelve years ago that child died and she still keeps the rubber sheet. Forty-five she is now and if there's another child we'll have to look for a star in the East. Malachy says, What's that? and she tells him mind his own business, he's too young.\nAunt Aggie places the rubber sheet on her bed and puts Alphie on it between herself and Uncle Pa. She sleeps inside against the wall and Uncle Pa outside because he has to get up in the morning for work. We are to sleep on the floor against the opposite wall with one coat under us and two over. She says if she hears a word out of us during the night she'll warm our arses and we're to be up early in the morning because it's Ash Wednesday and it wouldn't do us any harm to go to Mass and pray for our poor mother and her pneumonia.\nThe alarm clock shocks us out of our sleep. Aunt Aggie calls from her bed, The three of ye are to get up and go to Mass. Do ye hear me? Up. Wash yeer faces and go to the Jesuits.\nHer backyard is all frost and ice and our hands sting from the tap water. We throw a little on our faces and dry with the towel that's still damp from yesterday. Malachy whispers our wash was a lick and a promise, that's what Mam would say.\nThe streets are frosty and icy, too, but the Jesuit church is warm. It must be grand to be a Jesuit, sleeping in a bed with sheets blankets pillows and getting up to a nice warm house and a warm church with nothing to do but say Mass hear confessions and yell at people for their sins have your meals served up to you and read your Latin office before you go to sleep. I'd like to be a Jesuit some day but there's no hope of that when you grow up in a lane. Jesuits are very particular. They don't like poor people. They like people with motor cars who stick out their little fingers when they pick up their teacups.\nThe church is crowded with people at seven o'clock Mass getting the ashes on their foreheads. Malachy whispers that Michael shouldn't get the ashes because he won't be making his First Communion till May and it would be a sin. Michael starts to cry, I want the ashes, I want the ashes. An old woman behind us says, What are ye doin' to that lovely child? Malachy explains the lovely child never made his First Communion and he's not in a state of grace. Malachy is getting ready for Confirmation himself, always showing off his knowledge of the catechism, always going on about state of grace. He won't admit I knew all about the state of grace a year ago, so long ago I'm starting to forget it. The old woman says you don't have to be in a state of grace to get a few ashes on your forehead and tells Malachy stop tormenting his poor little brother. She pats Michael on the head and tells him he's a lovely child and go up there and get your ashes. He runs to the altar and when he comes back the woman gives him a penny to go with his ashes.\nAunt Aggie is still in the bed with Alphie. She tells Malachy to fill Alphie's bottle with milk and bring it to him. She tells me to start the fire in the range, that there's paper and wood in a box and coal in the coal scuttle. If the fire won't start sprinkle it with a little paraffin oil. The fire is slow and smoky and I sprinkle it with the paraffin oil, it flares up, whoosh, and nearly takes my eyebrows off. There is smoke everywhere and Aunt Aggie rushes into the kitchen. She shoves me away from the range. Jesus above, can't you do anything right? You're supposed to open the damper, you eejit.\nI don't know anything about dampers. In our house we have a fireplace in Ireland downstairs and a fireplace in Italy upstairs and no sign of a damper. Then you go to your aunt's house and you're supposed to know all about dampers. There's no use telling her this is the first time you ever lit a fire in a range. She'll just give you another thump on the skull and send you flying. It's hard to know why grown people get so angry over little things like dampers. When I'm a man I won't go around thumping small children over dampers or anything else. Now she yells at me, Look at Lord Muck standing there. Would you ever think of opening the window and letting out the smoke? Of course you wouldn't. You have a puss on you like your father from the North. Do you think now you can boil the water for the tea without burning the house down?\nShe cuts three slices from a loaf, smears them with margarine for us and goes back to bed. We have the tea and bread and it's one morning we're glad to go to school where it's warm and there are no yelling aunts.\nAfter school she tells me sit at the table and write my father a letter about Mam in the hospital and how we're all at Aunt Aggie's till Mam comes home. I'm to tell him we're all happy and in the best of health, send money, food is very dear, growing boys eat a lot, ha ha, Alphie the baby needs clothes and nappies.\nI don't know why she's always angry. Her flat is warm and dry. She has electric light in the house and her own lavatory in the backyard. Uncle Pa has a steady job and he brings home his wages every Friday. He drinks his pints at South's pub but never comes home singing songs of Ireland's long woeful history. He says, A pox on all their houses, and he says the funniest thing in the world is that we all have arses that have to be wiped and no man escapes that. The minute a politician or a Pope starts his blather Uncle Pa thinks of him wiping his arse. Hitler and Roosevelt and Churchill all wipe their arses. De Valera, too. He says the only people you can trust in that department are the Mahommedans for they eat with one hand and wipe with the other. The human hand itself is a sneaky bugger and you never know what it's been up to.\nThere are good times with Uncle Pa when Aunt Aggie goes to the Mechanics' Institute to play cards, forty-five. He says, To hell with the begrudgers. He gets himself two bottles of stout from South's, six buns and a half pound of ham from the shop on the corner. He makes tea and we sit by the range drinking it, eating our ham sandwiches and buns and laughing over Uncle Pa and the way he goes on about the world. He says, I swallowed the gas, I drink the pint, I don't give a fiddler's fart about the world and its cousin. If little Alphie gets tired and cranky and cries Uncle Pa pulls his shirt back from his chest and tells him, Here, have a suck of diddy momma. The sight of that flat chest and the nipple shocks Alphie and makes him good again.\nBefore Aunt Aggie comes home we have to wash the mugs and clean up so she won't know we were stuffing ourselves with buns and ham sandwiches. She'd nag Uncle Pa for a month if she ever found out and that's what I don't understand. Why does he let her nag him like that? He went to the Great War, he was gassed, he's big, he has a job, he makes the world laugh. It's a mystery. That's what the priests and the masters tell you, everything is a mystery and you have to believe what you're told.\nI could easily have Uncle Pa for a father. We'd have great times sitting by the fire in the range drinking tea and laughing over the way he farts and says, Light a match. That's a present from the Germans.\nAunt Aggie torments me all the time. She calls me scabby eyes. She says I'm the spitting image of my father, I have the odd manner, I have the sneaky air of a northern Presbyterian, I'll probably grow up and build an altar to Oliver Cromwell himself, I'll run off and marry an English tart and cover my house with pictures of the royal family.\nI want to get away from her and I can think of only one way, to make myself sick and go to the hospital. I get up in the middle of the night and go to her backyard. I can pretend I'm going to the lavatory. I stand out in the open in the freezing weather and hope I'll catch pneumonia or the galloping consumption so that I'll go to the hospital with the nice clean sheets and the meals in the bed and books brought by the girl in the blue dress. I might meet another Patricia Madigan and learn a long poem. I stand in the backyard for ages in my shirt and bare feet looking up at the moon which is a ghostly galleon riding upon cloudy seas and go back to bed shivering hoping I'll wake up in the morning with a terrible cough and flushed cheeks. But I don't. I feel fresh and lively and I'd be in great form if I could be at home with my mother and brothers.\nThere are days when Aunt Aggie tells us she can't stand the sight of us another minute, Get away from me. Here, scabby eyes, take Alphie out in his pram, take your brothers, go to the park and play, do anything ye like and don't come back till teatime when the Angelus is ringing, not a minute later, do ye hear me, not a minute later. It's cold but we don't care. We push the pram up O'Connell Avenue out to Ballinacurra or the Rosbrien Road. We let Alphie crawl around in fields to look at cows and sheep and we laugh when the cows nuzzle him. I get under the cows and squirt the milk into Alphie's mouth till he's full and throws it up. Farmers chase us till they see how small Michael and Alphie are. Malachy laughs at the farmers. He says, Hit me now with the child in me arms. Then he has a great notion, Why can't we go to our own house and play a while? We find twigs and bits of wood in the fields and rush to Roden Lane. There are matches by the fireplace in Italy and we have a good fire going in no time. Alphie falls asleep and soon the rest of us drift off till the Angelus booms out of the Redemptorist church and we know we're in trouble with Aunt Aggie for being late.\nWe don't care. She can yell at us all she wants but we had a grand time out the country with the cows and the sheep and then the lovely fire above in Italy.\nYou can tell she never has grand times like that. Electric light and a lavatory but no grand times.\nGrandma comes for her on Thursdays and Sundays and they take the bus to the hospital to see Mam. We can't go because children are not allowed and if we say, How's Mam? they look cranky and tell us she's all right, she'll live. We'd like to know when she's getting out of hospital so that we can all go back home but we're afraid to open our mouths.\nMalachy tells Aunt Aggie one day he's hungry and could he have a piece of bread. She hits him with a rolled up Little Messenger of the Sacred Heart and there are tears on his eyelashes. He doesn't come home from school the next day and he's still gone at bedtime. Aunt Aggie says, Well, I suppose he ran away. Good riddance. If he was hungry he'd be here. Let him find comfort in a ditch.\nNext day Michael runs in from the street, Dad's here, Dad's here, and runs back out and there's Dad sitting on the hall floor hugging Michael, crying, Your poor mother, your poor mother, and there's a smell of drink on him. Aunt Aggie is smiling, Oh, you're here, and she makes tea and eggs and sausages. She sends me out for a bottle of stout for Dad and I wonder why she's so pleasant and generous all of a sudden. Michael says, Are we going to our own house, Dad?\nWe are, son.\nAlphie is back in the pram with the three old coats and coal and wood for the fire. Aunt Aggie stands at her door and tells us be good boys, come back for tea anytime, and there's a bad word for her in my head, Oul' bitch. It's in my head and I can't help it and I'll have to tell the priest in confession.\nMalachy isn't in a ditch, he's there in our own house eating fish and chips a drunken soldier dropped at the gate of the Sarsfield Barracks.\nMam comes home in two days. She's weak and white and walks slowly. She says, The doctor told me keep warm, have plenty of rest and nourishing food, meat and eggs three times a week. God help us, those poor doctors don't have a notion of not having. Dad makes tea and toasts bread for her on the fire. He fries bread for the rest of us and we have a lovely night up in Italy where it's warm. He says he can't stay forever, he has to go back to work in Coventry. Mam wonders how he'll get to Coventry without a penny in his pocket. He's up early on Holy Saturday and I have tea with him by the fire. He fries four cuts of bread and wraps them in pages of the Limerick Chronicle, two cuts in each coat pocket. Mam is still in bed and he calls to her from the bottom of the stairs, I'm going now. She says, All right. Write when you land. My father is going to England and she won't even get out of the bed. I ask if I can go with him to the railway station. No, he's not going there. He's going to the Dublin road to see if he can get a lift. He pats my head, tells me take care of my mother and brothers and goes out the door. I watch him go up the lane till he turns the corner. I run up the lane to see him go down Barrack Hill and down St. Joseph's Street. I run down the hill and follow him as far as I can. He must know I'm following him because he turns and calls to me, Go home, Francis. Go home to your mother.\nIn a week there's a letter to say he arrived safely, that we are to be good boys, attend to our religious duties and above all obey our mother. In another week there's a telegram money order for three pounds and we're in heaven. We'll be rich, there will be fish and chips, jelly and custard, films every Saturday at the Lyric, the Coliseum, the Carlton, the Atheneum, the Central and the fanciest of all, the Savoy. We might even wind up having tea and cakes at the Savoy Caf\u00e9 with the nobs and toffs of Limerick. We'll be sure to hold our teacups with our little fingers sticking out.\nThe next Saturday there's no telegram nor the Saturday after nor any Saturday forever. Mam begs again at the St. Vincent de Paul Society and smiles at the Dispensary when Mr. Coffey and Mr. Kane have their bit of a joke about Dad having a tart in Piccadilly. Michael wants to know what a tart is and she tells him it's something you have with tea. She spends most of the day by the fire with Bridey Hannon puffing on her Woodlbines, drinking weak tea. The bread crumbs from the morning are always on the table when we come home from school. She never washes the\njam jars or mugs and there are flies in the sugar and wherever there is sweetness.\nShe says Malachy and I have to take turns looking after Alphie, taking him out in the pram for a bit of fresh air. The child can't be kept in Italy from October to April. If we tell her we want to play with our pals she might let fly with a right cross to the head that stings the ears.\nWe play games with Alphie and the pram. I stand at the top of Barrack Hill and Malachy is at the bottom. When I give the pram a push down the hill Malachy is supposed to stop it but he's looking at a pal on roller skates and it speeds by him across the street and through the doors of Leniston's pub where men are having a peaceful pint and not expecting a pram with a dirty faced child saying Goo goo goo goo. The barman shouts this is a disgrace, there must be a law against this class of behavior, babies roaring through the door in bockety prams, he'll call the guards on us, and Alphie waves at him and smiles and he says, all right, all right, the child can have a sweet and a lemonade, the brothers can have lemonade too, that raggedy pair, and God above, 'tis a hard world, the minute you think you're getting ahead a pram comes crashing through the door and you're dishing out sweets and lemonade right and left, the two of ye take that child and go home to yeer mother.\nMalachy has another powerful idea, that we could go around Limerick like tinkers pushing Alphie in his pram into pubs for the sweets and lemonade, but I don't want Mam finding out and hitting me with her right cross. Malachy says I'm not a sport and runs off. I push the pram over to Henry Street and up by the Redemptorist church. It's a gray day, the church is gray and the small crowd of people outside the door of the priests' house is gray. They're waiting to beg for any food left over from the priests' dinner.\nThere in the middle of the crowd in her dirty gray coat is my mother.\nThis is my own mother, begging. This is worse than the dole, the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the Dispensary. It's the worst kind of shame, almost as bad as begging on the streets where the tinkers hold up their scabby children, Give us a penny for the poor child, mister, the poor child is hungry, missus.\nMy mother is a beggar now and if anyone from the lane or my school sees her the family will be disgraced entirely. My pals will make up new names and torment me in the schoolyard and I know what they'll say, Frankie McCourt beggar woman's boy scabby-eyed dancing blubber-gob Jap.\nThe door of the priests' house swings open and the people rush with their hands out. I can hear them, Brother, brother, here, brother, ah, for the love o' God, brother. Five children at home, brother. I can see my own mother pushed along. I can see the tightness of her mouth when she snatches at a bag and turns from the door and I push the pram up the street before she can see me.\nI don't want to go home anymore. I push the pram down to the Dock Road, out to Corkanree where all the dust and garbage of Limerick is dumped and burned. I stand a while and look at boys chase rats. I don't know why they have to torture rats that are not in their houses. I'd keep going on into the country forever if I didn't have Alphie bawling with the hunger, kicking his chubby legs, waving his empty bottle.\nMam has the fire going and something boiling in a pot. Malachy smiles and says she brought home corned beef and a few spuds from\nKathleen O'Connell's shop. He wouldn't be so happy if he knew he was the son of a beggar. She calls us in from the lane and when we sit at the table it's hard for me to look at my mother the beggar. She lifts the pot to the table, spoons out the potatoes one each and uses a fork to lift out the corned beef.\nIt isn't corned beef at all. It's a great lump of quivering gray fat and the only sign of corned beef is a little nipple of red meat on top. We stare at that bit of meat and wonder who will get it. Mam says, That's for Alphie. He's a baby, he's growing fast, he needs it. She puts it on a saucer in front of him. He pushes it away with his finger, then pulls it back. He lifts it to his mouth, looks around the kitchen, sees Lucky the dog and throws it to him.\nThere's no use saying anything. The meat is gone. We eat our potatoes with plenty of salt and I eat my fat and pretend it's that nipple of red meat.\nXI\nMam warns us, Ye are to keep yeer paws out of that trunk for there's nothing in there that's of the slightest interest or any of yeer business.\nAll she has in that trunk is a lot of papers, certificates of birth and baptism, her Irish passport, Dad's English passport from Belfast, our American passports and her bright red flapper dress with spangles and black frills she brought all the way from America. She wants to keep that dress forever to remind herself she was young and dancing.\nI don't care what she has in the trunk till I start a football team with Billy Campbell and Malachy. We can't afford uniforms or boots and Billy says, How will the world know who we are? We don't even have a name.\nI remember the red dress and a name comes to me, The Red Hearts of Limerick. Mam never opens the trunk so what does it matter if I cut off a piece of the dress to make seven red hearts we can stick on our chests? What you don't know won't bother you, she always says herself.\nThe dress is buried under the papers. I look at my passport picture when I was small and I can see why they call me Jap. There's a paper that says Marriage Certificate, that Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan were joined in Holy Matrimony on the twenty-eighth of March, 1930. How could that be? I was born on the nineteenth of August and Billy Campbell told me the father and mother have to be married nine months before there's a sign of a child. Here I am born into the world in half the time. That means I must be a miracle and I might grow up to be a saint with people celebrating the feast of St. Francis of Limerick.\nI'll have to ask Mikey Molloy, still the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General.\nBilly says if we're to be great soccer players we have to practice and we're to meet over in the park. The boys complain when I hand out the hearts and I tell them if they don't like it they can go home and cut up their own mother's dresses and blouses.\nWe have no money for a proper ball so one of the boys brings a sheep's bladder stuffed with rags. We kick the bladder up and down the meadow till there are holes and rags start falling out and we get fed up\nkicking a bladder that's hardly there anymore. Billy says we're to meet tomorrow morning which is Saturday and go out Ballinacurra to see if we can challenge rich Crescent College boys to a proper game, seven a side. He says we're to pin our red hearts to our shirts even if they're red rags.\nMalachy is going home for tea but I can't go because I have to see Mikey Molloy and find out why I was born in half the time. Mikey is coming out of his house with his father, Peter. It's Mikey's sixteenth birthday and his father is taking him to Bowles's pub for his first pint. Nora Molloy is inside screeching after Peter that if they go they can stay gone, she's done baking bread, she's never going to the lunatic asylum again, if he brings that child home drunk she'll go to Scotland and disappear from the face of the earth.\nPeter tells Mikey, Pay no attention to her, Cyclops. The mothers of Ireland are always enemies of the first pint. My own mother tried to kill my father with a frying pan when he took me for the first pint.\nMikey asks Peter if I can come with them and have a lemonade.\nPeter tells everyone in the pub that Mikey is there for his first pint and when all the men want to stand Mikey a pint Peter says, Ah, no, 'twould be a terrible thing if he had too much and turned against it entirely.\nThe pints are drawn and we sit against the wall, the Molloys with their pints and I with my lemonade. The men wish Mikey all the best in the life to come and wasn't it a gift from God that he fell off that spout years ago and never had the fit since and wasn't it a great pity about that poor little bugger, Quasimodo Dooley, carried off with the consumption after all his trouble talking for years like an Englishman so he could be on the BBC which is no fit place for an Irishman anyway.\nPeter is talking to the men and Mikey, sipping his first pint, whispers to me, I don't think I like it, but don't tell my father. Then he tells me how he practices the English accent in secret so that he can be a BBC announcer, Quasimodo's dream. He tells me I can have Cuchulain back, that he's no use to you when you're reading the news on the BBC. Now that he's sixteen he wants to go to England and if ever I get a wireless that will be him on the BBC Home Service.\nI tell him about the marriage certificate, how Billy Campbell said it has to be nine months but I was born in half the time and would he know if I was some class of a miracle.\nNaw, he says, naw. You're a bastard. You're doomed.\nYou don't have to be cursing me, Mikey.\nI'm not. That's what they call people who aren't born inside the\nnine months of the marriage, people conceived beyond the blanket. What's that?\nWhat's what?\nConceived.\nThat's when the sperm hits the egg and it grows and there you are\nnine months later.\nI don't know what you're talking about.\nHe whispers, The thing between your legs is the excitement. I don't\nlike the other names, the dong, the prick, the dick, the langer. So your father shoves his excitement into your mother and there's a spurt and these little germs go up into your mother where there's an egg and that grows into you.\nI'm not an egg.\nYou are an egg. Everyone was an egg once.\nWhy am I doomed? 'Tisn't my fault I'm a bastard.\nAll bastards are doomed. They're like babies that weren't baptized.\nThey're sent to Limbo for eternity and there's no way out and it's not their fault. It makes you wonder about God up there on His throne with no mercy for the little unbaptized babies. That's why I don't go near the chapel anymore. Anyway, you're doomed. Your father and mother had the excitement and they weren't married so you're not in a state of grace.\nWhat am I going to do?\nNothing. You're doomed.\nCan't I light a candle or something.\nYou could try the Blessed Virgin. She's in charge of the doom.\nBut I don't have a penny for the candle.\nAll right, all right, here's a penny. You can give it back when you\nget a job a million years from now. 'Tis costing me a fortune to be the expert on Girls' Bodies and Dirty Things in General.\nThe barman is doing a crossword puzzle and he says to Peter, What's the opposite of advance?\nRetreat, says Peter.\nThat's it, says the barman. Everything has an opposite. Mother o' God, says Peter.\nWhat's up with you, Peter? says the barman.\nWhat was that you said before, Tommy?\nEverything has an opposite.\nMother o' God.\nAre you all right, Peter? Is the pint all right?\nThe pint is grand, Tommy, and I'm the champion of all pint\ndrinkers, amn't I?\nBegod an' you are, Peter. No denyin' that to you.\nThat means I could be the champion in the opposite department. What are you talking about, Peter?\nI could be the champion of no pints at all.\nAh, now, Peter, I think you're going a bit far. Is the wife all\nright at home?\nTommy, take this pint away from me. I'm the champion of no pints at\nall.\nPeter turns and takes the glass from Mikey. We're going home to\nyour mother, Mikey.\nYou didn't call me Cyclops, Dad.\nYou're Mikey. You're Michael. We're going to England. No more pints\nfor me, no pints for you, no more bread baking for your mother. Come on. We're leaving the pub and Tommy the barman calls after us, You know\nwhat 'tis, Peter. 'Tis all them bloody books you're reading. They have your head destroyed.\nPeter and Mikey turn to go home. I have to go to St. Joseph's to light the candle that will save me from the doom but I look in the window of Counihan's shop and there in the middle is a great slab of Cleeves' toffee and a sign, TWO PIECES FOR A PENNY. I know I'm doomed but the water is running along the sides of my tongue and when I put my penny on the counter for Miss Counihan I promise the Virgin Mary the next penny I get I'll be lighting a candle and would she please talk to her Son and delay the doom for awhile.\nA penn'orth of Cleeves' toffee doesn't last forever and when it's gone I have to think of going home to a mother who let my father push his\nexcitement into her so that I could be born in half the time and grow up to be a bastard. If she ever says a word about the red dress or anything I'll tell her I know all about the excitement and she'll be shocked.\nSaturday morning I meet The Red Hearts of Limerick and we wander out the road looking for a football challenge. The boys are still grousing that the bits of red dress don't look like hearts till Billy tells them if they don't want to play football go home and play with their sisters' dolls.\nThere are boys playing football in a field in Ballinacurra and Billy challenges them. They have eight players and we have only seven but we don't mind because one of them has one eye and Billy tells us stay on his blind side. Besides, he says, Frankie McCourt is nearly blind with his two bad eyes and that's worse. They're all togged out in blue and white jerseys and white shorts and proper football boots. One of them says we look like something the cat brought in and Malachy has to be held back from fighting them. We agree to play half an hour because the Ballinacurra boys say they have to go to lunch. Lunch. The whole world has dinner in the middle of the day but they have lunch. If no one scores in half an hour it's a draw. We play back and forth till Billy gets the ball and goes speeding and dancing up the sideline so fast no one can catch him and in goes the ball for a goal. The half hour is nearly up but the Ballinacurra boys want another half hour and they manage to score well into the second half hour. Then the ball goes over the line for touch. It's our ball. Billy stands on the touch line with the ball over his head. He pretends to look at Malachy but throws the ball to me. It comes to me as if it's the only thing that exists in the whole world. It comes straight to my foot and all I have to do is swivel to the left and swing that ball straight into the goal. There's a whiteness in my head and I feel like a boy in heaven. I'm floating over the whole field till The Red Hearts of Limerick clap me on the back and tell me that was a great goal, Frankie, you too, Billy.\nWe walk back along O'Connell Avenue and I keep thinking of the way the ball came to my foot and surely it was sent by God or the Blessed Virgin Mary who would never send such a blessing to one doomed for being born in half the time and I know as long as I live I'll never forget that ball coming from Billy Campbell, that goal.\nMam meets Bridey Hannon and her mother going up the lane and they tell her about Mr. Hannon's poor legs. Poor John, it's a trial for him to cycle home every night after delivering coal and turf all day on the great float for the coal merchants on the Dock Road. He's paid from eight in the morning till half five in the evening though he has to get the horse ready well before eight and settle him for the night well after half five. He's up and down on that float all day hoisting bags of coal and turf, desperate to keep the bandages in place on his legs so the dirt won't get into the open sores. The bandages are forever sticking and have to be ripped away and when he comes home she washes the sores with warm water and soap, covers them with ointment and wraps them in clean bandages. They can't afford new bandages every day so she keeps washing the old ones over and over till they're gray.\nMam says Mr. Hannon should see the doctor and Mrs. Hannon says, Sure, he seen the doctor a dozen times and the doctor says he has to stay off them legs. That's all. Stay off them legs. Sure how can he stay off them legs? He has to work. What would we live on if he didn't work?\nMam says maybe Bridey could get some kind of a job herself and Bridey is offended. Don't you know I have a weak chest, Angela? Don't you know I had rheumatic fever an' I could go at any time? I have to be careful.\nMam often talks about Bridey and her rheumatic fever and weak chest. She says, That one is able to sit here by the hour and complain about her ailments but it doesn't stop her from puffing away on the Woodbines.\nMam tells Bridey she's very sorry over the weak chest and it's terrible the way her father suffers. Mrs. Hannon tells my mother that John is getting worse every day, And what would you think, Mrs. McCourt, if your boy Frankie went on the float with him a few hours a week and helped him with the bags? We can barely afford it but Frankie could earn a shilling or two and John could rest his poor legs.\nMam says, I don't know, he's only eleven and he had that typhoid and the coal dust wouldn't be good for his eyes.\nBridey says, He'd be out in the air and there's nothing like fresh air for someone with bad eyes or getting over the typhoid, isn't that right, Frankie?\n'Tis, Bridey.\nI'm dying to go around with Mr. Hannon on the great float like a real workingman. If I'm good at it they might let me stay at home from school forever but Mam says, He can do it as long as it doesn't interfere with school and he can start on a Saturday morning.\nI'm a man now so I light the fire early on Saturday morning and make my own tea and fried bread. I wait next door for Mr. Hannon to come out with his bicycle and there's a lovely smell of rashers and eggs coming through the window. Mam says Mr. Hannon gets the best of food because Mrs. Hannon is as mad about him as she was the day she married him. They're like two lovers out of an American film the way they go on. Here he is pushing the bicycle and puffing away on the pipe in his mouth. He tells me climb up on the bar of his bike and off we go to my first job as a man. His head is over mine on the bike and the smell of the pipe is lovely. There's a coal smell on his clothes and that makes me sneeze.\nMen are walking or cycling toward the coal yards and Rank's Flour Mills and the Limerick Steamship Company on the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon takes his pipe from his mouth and tells me this is the best morning of all, Saturday, half day. We'll start at eight and be finished by the time the Angelus rings at twelve.\nFirst we get the horse ready, give him a bit of a rub, fill the wooden tub with oats and the bucket with water. Mr. Hannon shows me how to put on the harness and lets me back the horse into the shafts of the float. He says, Jaysus, Frankie, you have the knack of it.\nThat makes me so happy I want to jump up and down and drive a float the rest of my life.\nThere are two men filling bags with coal and turf and weighing them on the great iron scale, a hundredweight in each bag. It's their job to stack the bags on the float while Mr. Hannon goes to the office for the delivery dockets. The bag men are fast and we're ready for our rounds. Mr. Hannon sits up on the left side of the float and flicks the whip to show where I'm to sit on the right side. It's hard to climb up the way the float is so high and packed with bags and I try to get up by climbing the wheel. Mr. Hannon says I should never do the likes of that again. Never put your leg or hand near a wheel when the horse is harnessed in\nthe shafts. A horse might take a notion to go for a walk for himself and there you are with the leg or the arm caught in the wheel and twisted off your body and you looking at it. He says to the horse, G'up ower that, and the horse shakes his head and rattles the harness and Mr. Hannon laughs. That fool of a horse loves to work, he says. He won't be rattling his harness in a few hours.\nWhen the rain starts we cover ourselves with old coal bags and Mr. Hannon turns his pipe upside down in his mouth to keep the tobacco dry. He says the rain makes everything heavier but what's the use of complaining. You might as well complain about the sun in Africa.\nWe cross the Sarsfield Bridge for deliveries to the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road. Rich people, says Mr. Hannon, and very slow to put their hands in their pockets for a tip.\nWe have sixteen bags to deliver. Mr. Hannon says we're lucky today because some houses get more than one and he doesn't have to be climbing on and off that float destroying his legs. When we stop he gets down and I pull the bag to the edge and lay it on his shoulders. Some houses have areas outside where you pull up a trap door and tip the bag till it empties and that's easy. There are other houses with long backyards and you can see Mr. Hannon suffering with his legs when he has to carry the bags from the float to the sheds near the back doors. Ah, Jaysus, Frankie, ah, Jaysus, is the only complaint out of him and he asks me to give him a hand to climb back on the float. He says if he had a handcart he could wheel the bags from float to house and that would be a blessing but a handcart would cost two weeks' wages and who could afford that?\nThe bags are delivered and the sun is out, the float is empty, and the horse knows his workday is over. It's lovely to sit on the float looking along the length of the horse from his tail to his head rocking along the Ennis Road over the Shannon and up the Dock Road. Mr. Hannon says the man who delivered sixteen hundredweights of coal and turf deserves a pint and the boy who helped him deserves a lemonade. He tells me I should go to school and not be like him working away with the two legs rotting under him. Go to school, Frankie, and get out of Limerick and Ireland itself. This war will be over some day and you can go to America or Australia or any big open country where you can look up and see no end to the land. The world is wide and you can have great adventures. If I didn't have these two legs I'd be over in England making a fortune in the factories like the rest of the Irishmen, like your father. No, not like your father. I hear he left you high and dry, eh? I don't know how a man in his right mind can go off and leave a wife and family to starve and shiver in a Limerick winter. School, Frankie, school. The books, the books, the books. Get out of Limerick before your legs rot and your mind collapses entirely.\nThe horse clops along and when we get to the coal yard we feed and water him and give him a rubdown. Mr. Hannon talks to him all the time and calls him Me oul' segosha, and the horse snuffles and pushes his nose against Mr. Hannon's chest. I'd love to bring this horse home and let him stay downstairs when we're up in Italy but even if I could get him in the door my mother would yell at me that the last thing we need in this house is a horse.\nThe streets going up from the Dock Road are too hilly for Mr. Hannon to ride the bicycle and carry me, so we walk. His legs are sore from the day and it takes a long time to get up to Henry Street. He leans\non the bicycle or sits on the steps outside houses, grinding down on the pipe in his mouth.\nI'm wondering when I'll get the money for the day's work because Mam might let me go to the Lyric Cinema if I get home in time with my shilling or whatever Mr. Hannon gives me. Now we're at the door of South's pub and he tells me come in, didn't he promise me a lemonade?\nUncle Pa Keating is sitting in the pub. He's all black as usual and he's sitting next to Bill Galvin, all white as usual, snuffling and taking great slugs out of his black pint. Mr. Hannon says, How're you? and sits on the other side of Bill Galvin and everyone in the pub laughs. Jaysus, says the barman, look at that, two lumps of coal and a snowball. Men come in from other parts of the pub to see the two coal black men with the lime white man in the middle and they want to send down to the Limerick Leader for a man with a camera.\nUncle Pa says, What are you doing all black yourself, Frankie? Did you fall down a coal mine?\nI was helping Mr. Hannon on the float.\nYour eyes look atrocious, Frankie. Piss holes in the snow. 'Tis the coal dust, Uncle Pa.\nWash them when you go home.\nI will, Uncle Pa.\nMr. Hannon buys me a lemonade, gives me the shilling for my\nmorning's work and tells me I can go home now, I'm a great worker and I can help him again next week after school.\nOn the way home I see myself in the glass of a shop window all black from the coal, and I feel like a man, a man with a shilling in his pocket, a man who had a lemonade in a pub with two coal men and a lime man. I'm not a child anymore and I could easily leave Leamy's School forever. I could work with Mr. Hannon every day and when his legs got too bad I could take over the float and deliver coal to the rich people the rest of my life and my mother wouldn't have to be a beggar at the Redemptorist priests' house.\nPeople on the streets and lanes give me curious looks. Boys and girls laugh and call out, Here's the chimney sweep. How much do you want for cleaning our chimney? Did you fall into a coal hole? Were you burned by the darkness?\nThey're ignorant. They don't know I spent the day delivering hundredweights of coal and turf. They don't know I'm a man.\nMam is sleeping up in Italy with Alphie and there's a coat over the window to keep the room dark. I tell her I earned a shilling and she says I can go to the Lyric, I deserve it. Take tuppence and leave the rest of the shilling on the mantelpiece downstairs so that she can send out for a loaf of bread for the tea. The coat suddenly drops from the window and the room is bright. Mam looks at me, God above, look at your eyes. Go downstairs and I'll be down in a minute to wash them.\nShe heats water in the kettle and dabs at my eyes with boric acid powder and tells me I can't go to the Lyric Cinema today or any day till my eyes clear up though God knows when that will be. She says, You can't be delivering coal with the state of your eyes. The dust will surely destroy them.\nI want the job. I want to bring home the shilling. I want to be a man.\nYou can be a man without bringing home a shilling. Go upstairs and lie down and rest your two eyes or it's a blind man you'll be.\nI want that job. I wash my eyes three times a day with the boric acid powder. I remember Seamus in the hospital and how his uncle's eyes were cured with the blink exercise and I make sure to sit and blink for an hour every day. You can't beat the blink for the strong eye, he said. And now I blink and blink till Malachy runs to my mother, talking out in the lane with Mrs. Hannon, Mam, something is up with Frankie, he's upstairs blinking and blinking.\nShe comes running up. What's wrong with you? I'm making my eyes strong with the exercise. What exercise?\nThe blinking.\nBlinking is not exercise.\nSeamus in the hospital says you can't beat the blink for the strong eye. His uncle had powerful eyes from the blinking. She says I'm getting odd and goes back to the lane and her chat with Mrs. Hannon and I blink and bathe my eyes with the boric acid powder in warm water. I can hear Mrs. Hannon through the window, Your little Frankie is a godsend to John for 'tis the climbing up and down on that float that was ruining his legs entirely.\nMam doesn't say anything and that means she feels so sorry for Mr. Hannon she'll let me help him again on his heavy delivery day, Thursday. I wash my eyes three times a day and I blink till I get a pain in my eyebrows. I blink in school when the master isn't looking and all the boys in my class are calling me Blinky and adding that to the list of names.\nBlinky McCourt beggar woman's son scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing\nJap.\nI don't care what they call me anymore as long as my eyes are\nclearing up and I have a regular job lifting hundredweights of coal on a float. I wish they could see me on Thursday after school when I'm on the float and Mr. Hannon hands me the reins so that he can smoke his pipe in comfort. Here you are, Frankie, nice and gentle for this is a good horse and he doesn't need to be pulled at.\nHe hands me the whip too but you never need the whip with this horse. It's all for show and I just flick it at the air like Mr. Hannon or I might knock a fly off the horse's great golden rump swinging between the shafts.\nSurely the world is looking at me and admiring the way I rock with the float, the cool way I have with the reins and the whip. I wish I had a pipe like Mr. Hannon and a tweed cap. I wish I could be a real coal man with black skin like Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa Keating so that people would say, There goes Frankie McCourt that delivers all the coal in Limerick and drinks his pint in South's pub. I'd never wash my face. I'd be black every day of the year even Christmas when you're supposed to give yourself a good wash for the coming of the Infant Jesus. I know He wouldn't mind because I saw the Three Wise Men in the Christmas crib at the Redemptorist church and one of them was blacker than Uncle Pa Keating, the blackest man in Limerick, and if a Wise Man is black it means that everywhere you go in the world someone is delivering coal.\nThe horse lifts his tail and great lumps of steaming yellow shit drop from his behind. I start to pull on the reins so that he can stop and have a bit of comfort for himself but Mr. Hannon says, No, Frankie, let him trot. They always shit on the trot. That's one of the blessings horses have, they shit on the trot, and they're not dirty and stinking\nlike the human race, not at all, Frankie. The worst thing in the world is to go into a lavatory after a man that had a feed of pig's feet and a night of pints. The stink from that could twist the nostrils of a strong man. Horses are different. All they have is oats and hay and what they drop is clean and natural.\nI work with Mr. Hannon after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the half day on Saturday morning and that means three shillings for my mother though she worries all the time over my eyes. The minute I get home she washes them and makes me rest them for half an hour.\nMr. Hannon says he'll wait near Leamy's School for me on Thursdays after his deliveries on Barrington Street. Now the boys will see me. Now they'll know I'm a workingman and more than a scabby-eyed blubber gob dancing Jap. Mr. Hannon says, Up you get, and I climb up on the float like any workingman. I look at the boys gawking at me. Gawking. I tell Mr. Hannon if he wants to smoke his pipe in comfort I'll take the reins and when he hands them over I'm sure I hear the boys gasping. I tell the horse, G'up ower that, like Mr. Hannon. We trot away and I know dozens of Leamy's boys are committing the deadly sin of envy. I tell the horse again, G'up ower that, to make sure everyone heard, to make sure they know I'm driving that float and no one else, to make sure they'll never forget it was me they saw on that float with the reins and the whip. It's the best day of my life, better than my First Communion day, which Grandma ruined, better than my Confirmation day when I had the typhoid.\nThey don't call me names anymore. They don't laugh at my scabby eyes. They want to know how I got such a good job at eleven years of age and what I'm paid and if I'll have that job forever. They want to know if there are any other good jobs going in the coal yards and would I put in a good word for them.\nThen there are big boys of thirteen who stick their faces in mine and say they should have that job because they're bigger and I'm nothing but a scrawny little runt with no shoulders. They can talk as much as they like. I have the job and Mr. Hannon tells me I'm powerful.\nThere are days his legs are so bad he can hardly walk at all and you can see Mrs. Hannon worries. She gives me a mug of tea and I watch her roll up his trouser legs and peel away the dirty bandages. The sores are red and yellow and clogged with coal dust. She washes them with soapy water and smears them with a yellow ointment. She props the legs up on a chair and that's where he stays the rest of the night reading the paper or a book from the shelf above his head.\nThe legs are getting so bad he has to get up an hour earlier in the morning to get the stiffness out, to put on another dressing. It's still dark one Saturday morning when Mrs. Hannon knocks at our door and asks me if I'd go to a neighbor and borrow their handcart to take on the float for Mr. Hannon will never be able to carry the bags today and maybe I'd just roll them on the handcart for him. He won't be able to carry me on his bicycle so I can meet him at the yard with the handcart.\nThe neighbor says, Anything for Mr. Hannon, God bless him.\nI wait at the gate of the coal yard and watch him cycle toward me, slower than ever. He's so stiff he can hardly get off the bike and he says, You're a great man, Frankie. He lets me get the horse ready though I still have trouble getting on the harness. He lets me handle the float out of the yard and into the frosty streets and I wish I could drive forever and never go home. Mr. Hannon shows me how to pull the bags to the edge of the float and drop them on the ground so that I can pull them\non to the handcart and push them to the houses. He tells me how to lift and push the bags without straining myself and we have the sixteen bags delivered by noon.\nI wish the boys at Leamy's could see me now, the way I drive the horse and handle the bags, the way I do everything while Mr. Hannon rests his legs. I wish they could see me pushing the handcart to South's pub and having my lemonade with Mr. Hannon and Uncle Pa and me all black and Bill Galvin all white. I'd like to show the world the tips Mr. Hannon lets me keep, four shillings, and the shilling he gives me for the morning's work, five shillings altogether.\nMam is sitting by the fire and when I hand her the money she looks at me, drops it in her lap and cries. I'm puzzled because money is supposed to make you happy. Look at your eyes, she says. Go to that glass and look at your eyes.\nMy face is black and the eyes are worse than ever. The whites and the eyelids are red, and the yellow stuff oozes to the corners and out over the lower lids. If the ooze sits a while it forms a crust that has to be picked off or washed away.\nMam says that's the end of it. No more Mr. Hannon. I try to explain that Mr. Hannon needs me. He can barely walk anymore. I had to do everything this morning, drive the float, wheel the handcart with the bags, sit in the pub, drink lemonade, listen to the men discussing who is the best, Rommel or Montgomery.\nShe says she's sorry for Mr. Hannon's troubles but we have troubles of our own and the last thing she needs now is a blind son stumbling through the streets of Limerick. Bad enough you nearly died of typhoid, now you want to go blind on top of it.\nAnd I can't stop crying now because this was my one chance to be a man and bring home the money the telegram boy never brought from my father. I can't stop crying because I don't know what Mr. Hannon is going to do on Monday morning when he has no one to help him pull the bags to the edge of the float, to push the bags into the houses. I can't stop crying because of the way he is with that horse he calls sweet because he's so gentle himself and what will the horse do if Mr. Hannon isn't there to take him out, if I'm not there to take him out? Will that horse fall down hungry for the want of oats and hay and the odd apple?\nMam says I shouldn't be crying, it's bad for the eyes. She says, We'll see. That's all I can tell you now. We'll see.\nShe washes my eyes and gives me sixpence to take Malachy to the Lyric to see Boris Karloff in The Man They Could Not Hang and have two pieces of Cleeves' toffee. It's hard to see the screen with the yellow stuff oozing from my eyes and Malachy has to tell me what's happening. People around us tell him shut up, they'd like to hear what Boris Karloff is saying, and when Malachy talks back to them and tells them he's only helping his blind brother they call the man in charge, Frank Goggin, and he says if he hears another word out of Malachy he'll throw the two of us out.\nI don't mind. I have a way of squeezing the stuff out of one eye and clearing it so that I can see the screen while the other eye fills up and I go back and forth, squeeze, look, squeeze, look, and everything I see is yellow.\nMonday morning Mrs. Hannon is knocking on our door again. She asks Mam if Frank would ever go down to the coal yard and tell the man in the office that Mr. Hannon can't come in today, that he has to see a doctor\nabout his legs, that he'll surely be in tomorrow and what he can't deliver today he will tomorrow. Mrs. Hannon always calls me Frank now. Anyone that delivers hundredweights of coal is not a Frankie.\nThe man in the office says, Humph. I think we're very tolerant with Hannon. You, what's your name?\nMcCourt, sir.\nTell Hannon we'll need a note from the doctor. Do you understand\nthat?\nI do, sir.\nThe doctor tells Mr. Hannon he has to go to the hospital or it's a case of gangrene he'll have and the doctor won't be responsible. The ambulance takes Mr. Hannon away and my big job is gone. Now I'll be white like everyone else in Leamy's, no float, no horse, no shillings to bring home to my mother.\nIn a few days Bridey Hannon comes to our door. She says her mother would like me to come and see her, have a cup of tea with her. Mrs. Hannon is sitting by the fire with her hand on the seat of Mr. Hannon's chair. Sit down, Frank, she says, and when I go to sit on one of the ordinary kitchen chairs she says, No, sit here. Sit here on the chair of himself. Do you know how old he is, Frank?\nOh, he must be very old, Mrs. Hannon. He must be thirty-five.\nShe smiles. She has lovely teeth. He's forty-nine, Frank, and a man that age shouldn't have legs like that.\nHe shouldn't, Mrs. Hannon.\nDid you know you were a joy to him going around on that float?\nI didn't, Mrs. Hannon.\nYou were. We had two daughters, Bridey that you know, and Kathleen,\nthe nurse above in Dublin. But no son and he said you gave him the feeling of a son.\nI feel my eyes burning and I don't want her to see me crying especially when I don't know why I'm crying. That's all I do lately. Is it the job? Is it Mr. Hannon? My mother says, Oh, your bladder is near your eye.\nI think I'm crying because of the quiet way Mrs. Hannon is talking and she's talking like that because of Mr. Hannon.\nLike a son, she says, and I'm glad he had that feeling. His working days are over, you know. He has to stay at home from this out. There might be a cure and if there is sure he might be able to get a job as a watchman where he doesn't have to be lifting and hauling.\nI won't have a job anymore, Mrs. Hannon.\nYou have a job, Frank. School. That's your job.\nThat's not a job, Mrs. Hannon.\nYou'll never have another job like it, Frank. It breaks Mr.\nHannon's heart to think of you dragging bags of coal off a float and it breaks your mother's heart and 'twill destroy your eyes. God knows I'm sorry I ever got you into this for it had your poor mother caught between your eyes and Mr. Hannon's legs.\nCan I go to the hospital to see Mr. Hannon?\nThey might not let you in but surely you can come here to see him. God knows he won't be doing much but reading and looking out the window.\nMam tells me at home, You shouldn't cry but then again tears are salty and they'll wash the bad stuff from your eyes.\nXII\nThere's a letter from Dad. He's coming home two days before Christmas. He says everything will be different, he's a new man, he hopes we're good boys, obeying our mother, attending to our religious duties, and he's bringing us all something for Christmas.\nMam takes me to the railway station to meet him. The station is always exciting with all the coming and going, people leaning from carriages, crying, smiling, waving good-bye, the train hooting and calling, chugging away in clouds of steam, people sniffling on the platform, the railway tracks silvering into the distance, on to Dublin and the world beyond.\nNow it's near midnight and cold on the empty platform. A man in a railway cap asks us if we'd like to wait in a warm place. Mam says, Thank you very much, and laughs when he leads us to the end of the platform where we have to climb a ladder to the signal tower. It takes her a while because she's heavy and she keeps saying, Oh, God, oh, God.\nWe're above the world and it's dark in the signal tower except for the lights that blink red and green and yellow when the man bends over the board. He says, I'm just having a bit of supper and you're welcome.\nMam says, Ah, no, thanks, we couldn't take your supper from you.\nHe says, The wife always makes too much for me and if I was up in this tower for a week I wouldn't be able to eat it. Sure it's not hard work looking at lights and pulling on the odd lever.\nHe takes the top off a flask and pours cocoa into a mug. Here, he says to me, put yourself outside that cocoa.\nHe hands Mam half a sandwich. Ah, no, she says, surely you could take that home to your children.\nI have two sons, missus, and they're off there fighting in the forces of His Majesty, the King of England. One did his bit with Montgomery in Africa and the other is over in Burma or some other bloody place, excuse the language. We get our freedom from England and then we fight her wars. So here, missus, take the bit of sandwich.\nLights on the board are clicking and the man says, Your train is coming, missus.\nThank you very much and Happy Christmas.\nHappy Christmas to yourself, missus, and a Happy New Year, too. Mind yourself on that ladder, young fella. Help your mother.\nThank you very much, sir.\nWe wait again on the platform while the train rumbles into the station. Carriage doors open and a few men with suitcases step to the platform and hurry toward the gate. There is a clanking of milk cans dropped to the platform. A man and two boys are unloading newspapers and magazines.\nThere is no sign of my father. Mam says he might be asleep in one of the carriages but we know he hardly sleeps even in his own bed. She says the boat from Holyhead might have been late and that would make him miss the train. The Irish Sea is desperate at this time of the year.\nHe's not coming, Mam. He doesn't care about us. He's just drunk over there in England.\nDon't talk about your father like that.\nI say no more to her. I don't tell her I wish I had a father like the man in the signal tower who gives you sandwiches and cocoa.\nNext day Dad walks in the door. His top teeth are missing and there's a bruise under his left eye. He says the Irish Sea was rough and when he leaned over the side his teeth dropped out. Mam says, It wouldn't be the drink, would it? It wouldn't be a fight?\nOch, no, Angela.\nMichael says, You said you'd have something for us, Dad.\nOh, I do.\nHe takes a box of chocolates from his suitcase and hands it to Mam.\nShe opens the box and shows us the inside where half the chocolates are\ngone.\nCould you spare it? she says.\nShe shuts the box and puts it on the mantelpiece. We'll have\nchocolates after our Christmas dinner tomorrow.\nMam asks him if he brought any money. He tells her times are hard,\njobs are scarce, and she says, Is it coddin' me you are? There's a war on and there's nothing but jobs in England. You drank the money, didn't you?\nYou drank the money, Dad.\nYou drank the money, Dad.\nYou drank the money, Dad.\nWe're shouting so loud Alphie begins to cry. Dad says, Och, boys,\nnow boys. Respect for your father.\nHe puts on his cap. He has to see a man. Mam says, Go see your man\nbut don't come drunk to this house tonight singing Roddy McCorley or anything else.\nHe comes home drunk but he's quiet and passes out on the floor next to Mam's bed.\nWe have a Christmas dinner next day because of the food voucher Mam got from the St. Vincent de Paul Society. We have sheep's head, cabbage, floury white potatoes, and a bottle of cider because it's Christmas.\nDad says he's not hungry, he'll have tea, borrows a cigarette from Mam. She says, Eat something. It's Christmas.\nHe tells her again he's not hungry but if no one else wants them he'll eat the sheep's eyes. He says there's great nourishment in the eye and we all make sounds of disgust. He washes them down with his tea and smokes the rest of his Woodbine. He puts on his cap and goes upstairs for his suitcase.\nMam says, Where are you going?\nLondon.\nOn this day of Our Lord? Christmas Day?\nIt's the best day for travel. People in motor cars will always give\nthe workingman a lift to Dublin. They think of the hard times of the Holy Family.\nAnd how will you get on the boat to Holyhead without a penny in your pocket?\nThe way I came. There's always a time when they're not looking.\nHe kisses each of us on the forehead, tells us be good boys, obey Mam, say our prayers. He tells Mam he'll write and she says, Oh, yes, the way you always did. He stands before her with his suitcase. She gets up, takes down the box of chocolates and hands them around. She puts a chocolate in her mouth and takes it out again because it's too hard and she can't chew it. I have a soft one and I offer it for the hard one, which will last longer. It's creamy and rich and there's a nut in the middle. Malachy and Michael complain they didn't get a nut and why is it\nFrank always gets the nut? Mam says, What do you mean, always? This is the first time we ever had a box of chocolates.\nMalachy says, He got the raisin in the bun at school and all the boys said he gave it to Paddy Clohessy, so why couldn't he give us the nut?\nMam says, Because 'tis Christmas and he has sore eyes and the nut is good for the sore eyes.\nMichael says, Will the nut make his eyes better?\n'Twill.\nWill it make one eye better or will it make two eyes better?\nThe two eyes, I think.\nMalachy says, If I had another nut I'd give it to him for his eyes. Mam says, I know you would.\nDad watches us a moment eating our chocolates. He lifts the latch,\ngoes out the door and pulls it shut.\nMam tells Bridey Hannon, Days are bad but nights are worse and will\nthis rain ever stop? She tries to ease the bad days by staying in bed and letting Malachy and me light the fire in the morning while she sits up in the bed passing Alphie bits of bread and holding the mug to his mouth for the tea that's in it. We have to go downstairs to Ireland to wash our faces in the basin under the tap and try to dry ourselves in the old damp shirt that hangs over the back of a chair. She makes us stand by the bed to see if we left rings of dirt around our necks and if we did it's back down to the tap and the damp shirt. When there's a hole in a pair of pants she sits up and patches it with any rag she can find. We wear short pants till we're thirteen or fourteen and our long stockings always have holes to be darned. If she has no wool for the darning and the stockings are dark we can blacken our ankles with shoe polish for the respectability that's in it. It's a terrible thing to walk the world with skin showing through the holes of our stockings. When we wear them week after week the holes grow so big we have to pull the stocking forward under the toes so that the hole in the back is hidden in the shoe. On rainy days the stockings are soggy and we have to hang them before the fire at night and hope they'll dry by morning. Then they're hard with dirt cake and we're afraid to pull them on our feet for fear they'll fall on the floor in bits before our eyes. We might be lucky enough to get our stockings on but then we have to block the holes in our shoes and I fight with my brother, Malachy, over any scrap of cardboard or paper in the house. Michael is only six and he has to wait for anything left over unless Mam threatens us from the bed that we're to help our small brother. She says, If ye don't fix yeer brother's shoes an' I have to get out of this bed there will be wigs on the green. You'd have to feel sorry for Michael because he's too old to play with Alphie and too young to play with us and he can't fight with anyone for the same reasons.\nThe rest of the dressing is easy, the shirt I wore to bed is the shirt I wear to school. I wear it day in day out. It's the shirt for football, for climbing walls, for robbings orchards. I go to Mass and the Confraternity in that shirt and people sniff the air and move away. If Mam gets a docket for a new one at the St. Vincent de Paul the old shirt is promoted to towel and hangs damp on the chair for months or Mam might use bits of it to patch other shirts. She might even cut it up and let Alphie wear it a while before it winds up on the floor pushed against the bottom of the door to block the rain from the lane.\nWe go to school through lanes and back streets so that we won't meet the respectable boys who go to the Christian Brothers'School or the rich ones who go to the Jesuit school, Crescent College. The Christian Brothers' boys wear tweed jackets, warm woolen sweaters, shirts, ties and shiny new boots. We know they're the ones who will get jobs in the civil service and help the people who run the world. The Crescent College boys wear blazers and school scarves tossed around their necks and over their shoulders to show they're cock o' the walk. They have long hair which falls across their foreheads and over their eyes so that they can toss their quiffs like Englishmen. We know they're the ones who will go to university, take over the family business, run the government, run the world. We'll be the messenger boys on bicycles who deliver their groceries or we'll go to England to work on the building sites. Our sisters will mind their children and scrub their floors unless they go off to England, too. We know that. We're ashamed of the way we look and if boys from the rich schools pass remarks we'll get into a fight and wind up with bloody noses or torn clothes. Our masters will have no patience with us and our fights because their sons go to the rich schools and, Ye have no right to raise your hands to a better class of people so ye don't.\nYou never know when you might come home and find Mam sitting by the fire chatting with a woman and a child, strangers. Always a woman and child. Mam finds them wandering the streets and if they ask, Could you spare a few pennies, miss? her heart breaks. She never has money so she invites them home for tea and a bit of fried bread and if it's a bad night she'll let them sleep by the fire on a pile of rags in the corner. The bread she gives them always means less for us and if we complain she says there are always people worse off and we can surely spare a little from what we have.\nMichael is just as bad. He brings home stray dogs and old men. You never know when you'll find a dog in the bed with him. There are dogs with sores, dogs with no ears, no tails. There's a blind greyhound he found in the park tormented by children. Michael fought off the children, picked up the greyhound that was bigger than himself and told Mam the dog could have his supper. Mam says, What supper? We're lucky if there's a cut of bread in the house. Michael tells her the dog can have his bread. Mam says that dog has to go tomorrow and Michael cries all night and cries worse in the morning when he finds the dog dead in the bed beside him. He won't go to school because he has to dig a grave outside where the stable was and he wants all of us to dig with him and say the rosary. Malachy says it's useless saying prayers for a dog, how do you know he was even a Catholic? Michael says, Of course he was a Catholic dog. Didn't I have him in my arms? He cries so hard over the dog Mam lets us all stay at home from school. We're so delighted we don't mind helping Michael with the grave and we say three Hail Marys. We're not going to stand there wasting a good day off from school saying the rosary for a dead greyhound. Michael is only six but when he brings old men home he manages to get the fire going and give them tea. Mam says it's driving her crazy to come home and find these old men drinking out of her favorite mug and mumbling and scratching by the fire. She tells Bridey Hannon that Michael has a habit of bringing home old men all a bit gone in the head and if he doesn't have a bit of bread for them he knocks on neighbors' doors and has no shame begging for it. In the end she tells\nMichael, No more old men. One of them left us with lice and we're plagued.\nThe lice are disgusting, worse than rats. They're in our heads and ears and they sit in the hollows of our collarbones. They dig into our skin. They get into the seams of our clothes and they're everywhere in the coats we use as blankets. We have to search every inch of Alphie's body because he's a baby and helpless.\nThe lice are worse than the fleas. Lice squat and suck and we can see our blood through their skins. Fleas jump and bite and they're clean and we prefer them. Things that jump are cleaner than things that squat.\nWe all agree there will be no more stray women and children, dogs and old men. We don't want any more diseases and infections.\nMichael cries.\nGrandma's next-door neighbor, Mrs. Purcell, has the only wireless in her lane. The government gave it to her because she's old and blind. I want a radio. My grandmother is old but she's not blind and what's the use of having a grandmother who won't go blind and get a government radio?\nSunday nights I sit outside on the pavement under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to plays on the BBC and Radio Eireann, the Irish station. You can hear plays by O'Casey, Shaw, Ibsen and Shakespeare himself, the best of all, even if he is English. Shakespeare is like mashed potatoes, you can never get enough of him. And you can hear strange plays about Greeks plucking out their eyes because they married their mothers by mistake.\nOne night I'm sitting under Mrs. Purcell's window listening to Macbeth. Her daughter, Kathleen, sticks her head out the door. Come in, Frankie. My mother says you'll catch the consumption sitting on the ground in this weather.\nAh, no, Kathleen. It's all right.\nNo. Come in.\nThey give me tea and a grand cut of bread slathered with blackberry\njam. Mrs. Purcell says, Do you like the Shakespeare, Frankie?\nI love the Shakespeare, Mrs. Purcell.\nOh, he's music, Frankie, and he has the best stories in the world.\nI don't know what I'd do with meself of a Sunday night if I didn't have the Shakespeare.\nWhen the play finishes she lets me fiddle with the knob on the radio and I roam the dial for distant sounds on the shortwave band, strange whispering and hissing, the whoosh of the ocean coming and going and the Morse Code dit dit dit dot. I hear mandolins, guitars, Spanish bagpipes, the drums of Africa, boatmen wailing on the Nile. I see sailors on watch sipping mugs of hot cocoa. I see cathedrals, skyscrapers, cottages. I see Bedouins in the Sahara and the French Foreign Legion, cowboys on the American prairie. I see goats skipping along the rocky coast of Greece where the shepherds are blind because they married their mothers by mistake. I see people chatting in caf\u00e9s, sipping wine, strolling on boulevards and avenues. I see night women in doorways, monks chanting vespers, and here is the great boom of Big Ben, This is the BBC Overseas Service and here is the news.\nMrs. Purcell says, Leave that on, Frankie, so we'll know the state of the world.\nAfter the news there is the American Armed Forces Network and it's lovely to hear the American voices easy and cool and here is the music,\noh, man, the music of Duke Ellington himself telling me take the A train to where Billie Holiday sings only to me, I can't give you anything but love, baby.\nThat's the only thing I've plenty of, baby.\nOh, Billie, Billie, I want to be in America with you and all that music, where no one has bad teeth, people leave food on their plates, every family has a lavatory, and everyone lives happily ever after.\nAnd Mrs. Purcell says, Do you know what, Frankie?\nWhat, Mrs. Purcell?\nThat Shakespeare is that good he must have been an Irishman. The rent man is losing his patience. He tells Mam, Four weeks\nbehind you are, missus. That's one pound two shillings. This has to stop for I have to go back to the office and report to Sir Vincent Nash that the McCourts are a month behind. Where am I then, missus? Out on my arse jobless and a mother to support that's ninety-two and a daily communicant in the Franciscan church. The rent man collects the rents, missus, or he loses the job. I'll be back next week and if you don't have the money, one pound eight shillings and sixpence total, 'tis out on the pavement you'll be with the skies dripping on your furniture.\nMam comes back up to Italy and sits by the fire wondering where in God's name she'll get the money for a week's rent never mind the arrears. She'd love a cup of tea but there's no way of boiling the water till Malachy pulls a loose board off the wall between the two upstairs rooms. Mam says, Well, 'tis off now and we might as well chop it up for the fire. We boil the water and use the rest of the wood for the morning tea but what about tonight and tomorrow and ever after? Mam says, One more board from that wall, one more and not another one. She says that for two weeks till there's nothing left but the beam frame. She warns us we are not to touch the beams for they hold up the ceiling and the house itself.\nOh, we'd never touch the beams.\nShe goes to see Grandma and it's so cold in the house I take the hatchet to one of the beams. Malachy cheers me on and Michael claps his hands with excitement. I pull on the beam, the ceiling groans and down on Mam's bed there's a shower of plaster, slates, rain. Malachy says, Oh, God, we'll all be killed, and Michael dances around singing, Frankie broke the house, Frankie broke the house.\nWe run through the rain to tell Mam the news. She looks puzzled with Michael chanting, Frankie broke the house, till I explain there's a hole in the house and it's falling down. She says, Jesus, and runs through the streets with Grandma trying to keep up.\nMam sees her bed buried under plaster and slates and pulls at her hair, What'll we do at all, at all? and screams at me for interfering with the beams. Grandma says, I'll go to the landlord's office and tell them fix this before ye are all drowned entirely.\nShe's back in no time with the rent man. He says, Great God in heaven, where's the other room?\nGrandma says, What room?\nI rented ye two rooms up here and one is gone. Where is that room? Mam says, What room?\nThere were two rooms up here and now there's one. And what happened\nto the wall? There was a wall. Now there's no wall. I distinctly remember a wall because I distinctly remember a room. Now where is that wall? Where is that room?\nGrandma says, I don't remember a wall and if I don't remember a wall how can I remember a room?\nYe don't remember? Well, I remember. Forty years a landlord's agent and I never seen the likes of this. By God, 'tis a desperate situation altogether when you can't turn your back but tenants are not paying their rent and making walls and rooms disappear on top of it. I want to know where that wall is and what ye did with the room, so I do.\nMam turns to us. Do any of ye remember a wall?\nMichael pulls at her hand. Is that the wall we burned in the fire? The rent man says, Dear God in heaven, this beats Banagher, this\ntakes the bloody biscuit, this is goin' beyond the beyonds. No rent and what am I to tell Sir Vincent below in the office? Out, missus, I'm puttin' ye out. One week from today I'll knock on this door and I want to find nobody at home, everybody out never to return. Do you have me, missus?\nMam's face is tight. 'Tis a pity you weren't alive in the times when the English were evicting us and leaving us on the side of the road.\nNo lip, missus, or I'll send the men to put ye out tomorrow.\nHe goes out the door and leaves it open to show what he thinks of us. Mam says, I don't know in God's name what I'm going to do. Grandma says, Well, I don't have room for ye but your cousin, Gerard Griffin, is living out the Rosbrien Road in that little house of his mother's and he'd surely be able to take ye in till better times come. 'Tis all hours of the night but I'll go up and see what he says and Frank can come with me.\nShe tells me put on a coat but I don't have one and she says, I suppose there's no use in asking if ye have an umbrella either. Come on.\nShe pulls the shawl over her head and I follow her out the door, up the lane, through the rain to Rosbrien Road nearly two miles away. She knocks on the door of a little cottage in a long row of little cottages. Are you there, Laman? I know you're in there. Open the door.\nGrandma, why are you calling him Laman? Isn't his name Gerard?\nHow would I know? Do I know why the world calls your uncle Pat Ab? Everyone calls this fella Laman. Open the door. We'll go in. He might be working overtime.\nShe pushes the door. It's dark and there's a damp sweet smell in the room. This room looks like the kitchen and there's a smaller room next to it. There's a little loft above the bedroom with a skylight where the rain is beating. There are boxes everywhere, newspapers, magazines, bits of food, mugs, empty tins. We can see two beds taking up all the space in the bedroom, a great acre of a bed and a smaller one near the window. Grandma pokes at a lump in the big bed. Laman, is that you? Get up, will you, get up.\nWhat? What? What? What?\nThere's trouble. Angela is gettin' evicted with the children an' 'tis delvin'out of the heavens. They need a bit of shelter till\nthey get on their feet an' I have no room for them. You can put them up in the loft if you like but that wouldn't do because the small ones wouldn't be able to climb and they'd fall down an' get killed so you go up there an' they can move in here.\nAll right, all right, all right, all right.\nHe hoists himself from the bed and there's a whiskey smell. He goes to the kitchen and pulls the table to the wall for his climb to the loft.\nGrandma says, That's fine now. Ye can move up here tonight an' ye won't have the eviction men coming after ye.\nGrandma tells Mam she's going home. She's tired and drenched and she's not twenty-five anymore. She says there's no need to be taking beds or furniture with all the stuff that's up in Laman Griffin's. We put Alphie in the pram and pile around him the pot, the pan, the kettle, the jam jars and mugs, the Pope, two bolsters and the coats from the beds. We drape the coats over our heads and push the pram through the streets. Mam tells us be quiet going up the lane or the neighbors will know we got the eviction and there will be shame. The pram has a bockety wheel which tilts it and makes it go in different directions. We try to keep it straight and we're having a great time because it must be after midnight and surely Mam won't make us go to school tomorrow. We're moving so far from Leamy's School now maybe we'll never have to go again. Once we get away from the lane Alphie bangs on the pot with the spoon and Michael sings a song he heard in a film with Al Jolson, Swanee, how I love ya, how I love ya, my dear ol'Swanee. He makes us laugh the way he tries to sing in a deep voice like Al Jolson.\nMam says she's glad it's late and there's no one on the streets to see our shame.\nOnce we get to the house we take Alphie and everything else from the pram so that Malachy and I can run back down to Roden Lane for the trunk. Mam says she'd die if she lost that trunk and everything in it.\nMalachy and I sleep at opposite ends of the small bed. Mam takes the big bed with Alphie beside her and Michael at the bottom. Everything is damp and musty and Laman Griffin snores over our heads. There are no stairs in this house and that means no angel ever on the seventh step.\nBut I'm twelve going on thirteen and I might be too old for angels.\nIt's still dark when the alarm goes off in the morning and Laman Griffin snorts and blows his nose and hawks the stuff from his chest. The floor creaks under him and when he pisses for ages into the chamber pot we have to stuff our mouths with coats to stop the laughing and Mam hisses at us to be quiet. He grumbles away above us before he climbs down to get his bicycle and bang his way out the door. Mam whispers, The coast is clear, go back to sleep. Ye can stay at home today.\nWe can't sleep. We're in a new house, we have to pee and we want to explore. The lavatory is outside, about ten steps from the back door, our own lavatory, with a door you can close and a proper seat where you can sit and read squares of the Limerick Leader Laman Griffin left behind for wiping himself. There is a long backyard, a garden with tall grass and weeds, an old bicycle that must have belonged to a giant, tin cans galore, old papers and magazines rotting into the earth, a rusted sewing machine, a dead cat with a rope around his neck that somebody must have thrown over the fence.\nMichael gets a notion in his head that this is Africa and keeps asking, Where's Tarzan? Where's Tarzan? He runs up and down the backyard with no pants on trying to imitate Tarzan yodeling from tree to tree. Malachy looks over the fences into the other yards and tells us, They have gardens. They're growing things. We can grow things. We can have our own spuds and everything.\nMam calls from the back door, See if ye can find anything to start the fire in here.\nThere's a wooden shed built against the back of the house. It's collapsing and surely we could use some of the wood for the fire. Mam is\ndisgusted with the wood we bring in. She says it's rotten and full of white maggots but beggars can't be choosers. The wood sizzles above the burning paper and we watch the white maggots try to escape. Michael says he feels sorry for the white maggots but we know he's sorry for everything in the world.\nMam tells us this house used to be a shop, that Laman Griffin's mother sold groceries through the little window and that's how she was able to send Laman away to Rockwell College so that he could wind up as an officer in the Royal Navy. Oh, he was, indeed. An officer in the Royal Navy, and here's a picture of him with other officers all having dinner with a famous American film star Jean Harlow. He was never the same after he met Jean Harlow. He fell madly in love with her but what was the use? She was Jean Harlow and he was nothing but an officer in the Royal Navy and it drove him to drink and they threw him out of the Navy. Now look at him, a common laborer for the Electricity Supply Board and a house that's a disgrace. You'd look at this house and never know there was a human being living in it. You can see Laman never moved a thing since his mother died and now we have to clean up so that we can live in this place.\nThere are boxes packed with bottles of purple hair oil. While Mam is out in the lavatory we open a bottle and smear it on our heads. Malachy says the smell is gorgeous but when Mam comes back she says, What's that horrible stink? and wants to know why our heads are suddenly greasy. She makes us stick our heads under the tap outside and dry ourselves with an old towel pulled out from under a pile of magazines called The Illustrated London News so old they have pictures of Queen Victoria and Prince Edward waving. There are bars of Pear's soap and a thick book called Pear's Encyclopedia, which keeps me up day and night because it tells you everything about everything and that's all I want to know.\nThere are bottles of Sloan's Liniment, which Mam says will come in handy when we get cramps and pains from the damp. The bottles say, Here's the pain, Where's the Sloan's? There are boxes of safety pins and bags packed with women's hats that crumble when you touch them. There are bags with corsets, garters, women's high button shoes and different laxatives that promise glowing cheeks, bright eyes and a curl in your hair. There are letters from General Eoin O'Duffy to Gerard Griffin, Esq., saying welcome to the ranks of the National Front, the Irish Blueshirts, that it is a privilege to know a man like Gerard Griffin is interested in the movement with his excellent education, his Royal Navy training, his reputation as a great rugby player on the Young Munster team that won the national championship, the Bateman Cup. General O'Duffy is forming an Irish Brigade that will soon sail off to Spain to fight with that great Catholic Generalissimo Franco himself, and Mr. Griffin would be a powerful addition to the Brigade.\nMam says Laman's mother wouldn't let him go. She didn't spend all those years slaving away in a little shop to send him to college so that he could go gallivanting off to Spain for Franco so he stayed at home and got that job digging holes for the poles of the Electricity Supply Board along country roads and his mother was happy to have him home to herself every night but Friday when he drank his pint and moaned over Jean Harlow.\nMam is happy we'll have loads of paper for lighting the fire though the wood we burn from that collapsing shed leaves a sickening smell and she worries the white maggots will escape and breed.\nWe work all day moving boxes and bags to the shed outside. Mam opens all the windows to air the house and let out the smell of the hair oil and the years of no air. She says it's a relief to be able to see the floor again and now we can sit down and have a nice cup of tea in peace, ease and comfort, and won't it be lovely when the warm weather comes and we might be able to have a garden and sit outside with our tea the way the English do.\nLaman Griffin comes home at six every night but Friday, has his tea and goes to bed till next morning. Saturdays he goes to bed at one in the afternoon and stays there till Monday morning. He pulls the kitchen table over to the wall under the loft, climbs up on a chair, pulls the chair up to the table, climbs up on the chair again, catches a leg of the bed, pulls himself up. If he's too drunk on Fridays he makes me climb up for his pillow and blankets and sleeps on the kitchen floor by the fire or falls into bed with me and my brothers and snores and farts all night.\nWhen we first moved in he complained over how he gave up his room downstairs for the loft and he's worn out climbing up and down to go to the lavatory in the backyard. He calls down, Bring the table, the chair, I'm coming down, and we have to clear off the table and pull it to the wall. He's fed up, he's finished with the climbing, he's going to use his mother's lovely chamber pot. He lies in bed all day reading books from the library, smoking Gold Flake cigarettes and throwing Mam a few shillings to send one of us to the shop so that he can have scones with his tea or a nice bit of ham and sliced tomato. Then he calls to Mam, Angela, this chamber pot is full, and she drags chair and table to climb for the chamber pot, empty it in the lavatory outside, rinse it and climb back to the loft. Her face gets tight and she says, Is there anything else your lordship would like this day? and he laughs, Woman's work, Angela, woman's work and free rent.\nLaman throws down his library card from the loft and tells me get him two books, one on angling, one on gardening. He writes a note to the librarian to say his legs are killing him from digging holes for the Electricity Supply Board and from now on Frank McCourt will be getting his books. He knows the boy is only thirteen going on fourteen and he knows the rules are strict about allowing children into the adult part of the library but the boy will wash his hands and behave himself and do what he's told, thank you.\nThe librarian reads the note and says 'tis an awful pity about Mr. Griffin, he's a true gentleman and a man of great learning, you wouldn't believe the books he reads, sometimes four a week, that one day he took home a book in French, French, if you don't mind, on the history of the rudder, the rudder, if you don't mind, she'd give anything for a look inside his head for it must be packed with all sorts of learning, packed, if you don't mind.\nShe picks out a gorgeous book with colored pictures about English gardens. She says, I know what he likes in the fishing department, and chooses a book called In Search of the Irish Salmon by Brigadier General Hugh Colton. Oh, says the librarian, he reads hundreds of books about English officers fishing in Ireland. I've read some myself out of pure curiosity and you can see why those officers are glad to be in Ireland after all they put up with in India and Africa and other desperate\nplaces. At least the people here are polite. We're known for that, the politeness, not running around throwing spears at people.\nLaman lies in the bed, reads his books, talks down from the loft about the day his legs will heal and he'll be out there in the back planting a garden which will be famous far and wide for color and beauty and when he's not gardening he'll be roaming the rivers around Limerick and bringing home salmon that will make your mouth water. His mother left a recipe for salmon that's a family secret and if he had the time and his legs weren't killing him he'd find it someplace in this house. He says now that I'm reliable I can get a book for myself every week but don't be bringing home filth. I want to know what the filth is but he won't tell me so I'll have to find out for myself.\nMam says she wants to join the library too but it's a long walk from Laman's house, two miles, and would I mind getting her a book every week, a romance by Charlotte M. Brame or any other nice writer. She doesn't want any books about English officers looking for salmon or books about people shooting each other. There's enough trouble in the world without reading about people bothering fish and each other.\nGrandma caught a chill the night we had the trouble in the house in Roden Lane and the chill turned into pneumonia. They shifted her to the City Home Hospital and now she's dead.\nHer oldest son, my uncle Tom, thought he'd go to England to work like other men in the lanes of Limerick but his consumption got worse and he came back to Limerick and now he's dead.\nHis wife, Galway Jane, followed him, and four of their six children had to be put into orphanages. The oldest boy, Gerry, ran away and joined the Irish army, deserted and crossed to the English army. The oldest girl, Peggy, went to Aunt Aggie and lives in misery.\nThe Irish army is looking for boys who are musical and would like to train in the Army School of Music. They accept my brother, Malachy, and he goes off to Dublin to be a soldier and play the trumpet.\nNow I have only two brothers at home and Mam says her family is disappearing before her very eyes.\nXIII\nBoys from my class at Leamy's School are going on a weekend cycling trip to Killaloe. They tell me I should borrow a bicycle and come. All I need is a blanket, a few spoons of tea and sugar and a few cuts of bread to keep me going. I'll learn to cycle on Laman Griffin's bicycle every night after he goes to bed and he'll surely let me borrow it for the two days in Killaloe.\nThe best time to ask him for anything is Friday night when he's in a good mood after his night of drinking and his dinner. He brings home the same dinner in his overcoat pockets, a big steak dripping blood, four potatoes, an onion, a bottle of stout. Mam boils the potatoes and fries the steak with sliced onion. He keeps his overcoat on, sits at the table and eats the steak out of his hands. The grease and blood roll down his chin and on to the overcoat where he wipes his hands. He drinks his stout and laughs that there's nothing like a great bloody steak of a Friday night and if that's the worst sin he ever commits he'll float to heaven body and soul, ha ha ha.\nOf course you can have my bike, he says. Boy should be able to get out and see the countryside. Of course. But you have to earn it. You can't be getting something for nothing, isn't that right?\n'Tis.\nAnd I have a job for you. You don't mind doing a bit of a job, do\nyou?\nI don't.\nAnd you'd like to help your mother?\nI would.\nWell, now, that very chamber pot is full since this morning. I want\nyou to climb up and get it and take it to the lavatory and rinse it under the tap abroad and climb back up with it.\nI don't want to empty his chamber pot but I dream of cycling miles on the road to Killaloe, fields and sky far from this house, a swim in the Shannon, a night sleeping in a barn. I pull the table and chair to the wall. I climb up and under the bed there's the plain white chamber pot streaked brown and yellow, brimming with piss and shit. I lay it gently at the edge of the loft so that it won't spill, climb down to the chair, reach for the chamber pot, bring it down, turn my face away, hold it while I step down to the table, place it on the chair, step to the floor, take the chamber pot to the lavatory, empty it, and get sick behind the lavatory till I get used to this job.\nLaman says I'm a good boy and the bike is mine anytime I want it as long as the chamber pot is empty and I'm there to run to the shop for his cigarettes, go to the library for books and do whatever else he wants. He says, You have a great way with a chamber pot. He laughs and Mam stares into the dead ashes in the fireplace.\nIt's raining so hard one day, Miss O'Riordan the librarian says, Don't go out in that or you'll ruin the books you're carrying. Sit down over there and behave yourself. You can read all about the saints while you're waiting.\nThere are four big books, Butler's Lives of the Saints. I don't want to spend my life reading about saints but when I start I wish the rain would last forever. Whenever you see pictures of saints, men or women, they're always looking up to heaven where there are clouds filled with little fat angels carrying flowers or harps giving praise. Uncle Pa Keating says he can't think of a single saint in heaven he'd want to sit down and have a pint with. The saints in these books are different. There are stories about virgins, martyrs, virgin martyrs and they're worse than any horror film at the Lyric Cinema.\nI have to look in the dictionary to find out what a virgin is. I know the Mother of God is the Virgin Mary and they call her that because she didn't have a proper husband, only poor old St. Joseph. In the Lives of the Saints the virgins are always getting into trouble and I don't know why. The dictionary says, Virgin, woman (usually a young woman) who is and remains in a state of inviolate chastity.\nNow I have to look up inviolate and chastity and all I can find here is that inviolate means not violated and chastity means chaste and that means pure from unlawful sexual intercourse. Now I have to look up intercourse and that leads to intromission, which leads to intromittent, the copulatory organ of any male animal. Copulatory leads to copulation, the union of the sexes in the art of generation and I don't know what that means and I'm too weary going from one word to another in this heavy dictionary which leads me on a wild goose chase from this word to that\nword and all because the people who wrote the dictionary don't want the likes of me to know anything.\nAll I want to know is where I came from but if you ask anyone they tell you ask someone else or send you from word to word.\nAll these virgin martyrs are told by Roman judges they have to give up their faith and accept the Roman gods but they say, Nay, and the judges have them tortured and killed. My favorite is St. Christina the Astonishing who takes ages to die. The judge says, Cut off her breast, and when they do she throws it at him and he goes deaf dumb and blind. Another judge is brought on the case and he says, Cut off the other breast, and the same thing happens. They try to kill her with arrows but they just bounce off her and kill the soldiers who shot them. They try to boil her in oil but she rocks in the vat and takes a nap for herself. Then the judges get fed up and have her head cut off and that does the job. The feast of St. Christina the Astonishing is the twenty-fourth of July and I think I'll keep that for myself along with the feast of St. Francis of Assisi on the fourth of October. The librarian says, You have to go home now, the rain is stopped, and when I'm going out the door she calls me back. She wants to write a note to my mother and she doesn't mind one bit if I read it. The note says, Dear Mrs. McCourt, Just when you think Ireland is gone to the dogs altogether you find a boy sitting in the library so absorbed in the Lives of the Saints he doesn't realize the rain has stopped and you have to drag him away from the aforesaid Lives. I think, Mrs. McCourt, you might have a future priest on your hands and I will light a candle in hopes it comes true. I remain, Yours truly, Catherine O'Riordan, Asst. Librarian.\nHoppy O'Halloran is the only master in Leamy's National School who ever sits. That's because he's the headmaster or because he has to rest himself from the twisting walk that comes from the short leg. The other masters walk back and forth in the front of the room or up and down the aisles and you never know when you'll get a whack of a cane or a slap of a strap for giving the wrong answer or writing something sloppy. If Hoppy wants to do anything to you he calls you to the front of the room to punish you before three classes.\nThere are good days when he sits at the desk and talks about America. He says, My boys, from the frozen wastes of North Dakota to the fragrant orange groves of Florida, Americans enjoy all climates. He talks about American history, If the American farmer, with flintlock and musket, could wrest from the English a continent, surely we, warriors ever, can recover our island.\nIf we don't want him tormenting us with algebra or Irish grammar all we have to do is ask him a question about America and that gets him so excited he might go on for the whole day.\nHe sits at his desk and recites the tribes and chiefs he loves. Arapaho, Cheyenne, Chippewa, Sioux, Apache, Iroquois. Poetry, my boys, poetry. And listen to the chiefs, Kicking Bear, Rain-in-the-Face, Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and the genius, Geronimo.\nIn seventh class he hands out a small book, a poem that goes on for pages and pages, The Deserted Village, by Oliver Goldsmith. He says that this seems to be a poem about England but it is a lament for the poet's native land, our own native land, Ireland. We are to get this poem by heart, twenty lines a night to be recited every morning. Six boys are called to the front of the room for reciting and if you miss a line you are slapped twice on each hand. He tells us put the books under the desks\nand the whole class chants the passage on the schoolmaster in the village.\nBeside yon straggling fence that skirts the way, With blossomed furze unprofitably gay,\nThere, in his noisy mansion, skilled to rule\nThe village master taught his little school.\nA man severe he was and stern to view, I knew him well, and every truant knew.\nFull well the boding tremblers learned to trace The day's disaster in his morning face.\nFull well they laughed with counterfeited glee At all his jokes for many a joke had he.\nFull well the busy whisper circling round Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned.\nHe always closes his eyes and smiles when we reach the last lines of the passage, Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught, The love he bore to learning was in fault.\nThe village all declared how much he knew.\n'Twas certain he could write, and cipher too. Lands he could measure, terms and tides presage, And even the story ran that he could gauge.\nIn arguing, too, the parson owned his skill, For, even though vanquished, he could argue still, While words of learned length and thundering sound Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around.\nAnd still they gazed, and still the wonder grew, That one small head could carry all he knew.\nWe know he loves these lines because they're about a schoolmaster, about him, and he's right because we wonder how one small head could carry all he knows and we will remember him in these lines. He says, Ah, boys, boys, You can make up your own minds but first stock them. Are you listening to me? Stock your minds and you can move through the world resplendent. Clarke, define resplendent.\nI think it's shining, sir.\nPithy, Clarke, but adequate. McCourt, give us a sentence with pithy.\nClarke is pithy but adequate, sir.\nAdroit, McCourt. You have a mind for the priesthood, my boy, or politics. Think of that.\nI will, sir.\nTell your mother come and see me.\nI will, sir.\nMam says, No, I could never go near Mr. O'Halloran. I don't have a\ndecent dress or a proper coat. What does he want to see me for? I don't know.\nWell, ask him.\nI can't. He'll kill me. If he says bring your mother you have to bring your mother or out comes the stick.\nShe comes to see him and he talks to her in the hallway. He tells her that her son Frank must continue school. He must not fall into the\nmessenger boy trap. That leads nowhere. Take him up to the Christian Brothers, tell them I sent you, tell them he is a bright boy and ought to be going to secondary school and beyond that, university.\nHe tells her he did not become headmaster of Leamy's National School to preside over an academy of messenger boys.\nMam says, Thank you, Mr. O'Halloran.\nI wish Mr. O'Halloran would mind his own business. I don't want to go to the Christian Brothers. I want to quit school forever and get a job, get my wages every Friday, go to the pictures on Saturday nights like everyone.\nA few days later Mam tells me give my face and hands a good wash, we're going to the Christian Brothers. I tell her I don't want to go, I want to work, I want to be a man. She tells me stop the whining, I'm going to secondary school and we'll all manage somehow. I'm going to school if she has to scrub floors and she'll practice on my face.\nShe knocks on the door at the Christian Brothers and says she wants to see the superior, Brother Murray. He comes to the door, looks at my mother and me and says, What?\nMam says, This is my son, Frank. Mr. O'Halloran at Leamy's says he's bright and would there be any chance of getting him in here for secondary school?\nWe don't have room for him, says Brother Murray and closes the door in our faces.\nMam turns away from the door and it's a long silent walk home. She takes off her coat, makes tea, sits by the fire. Listen to me, she says. Are you listening?\nI am.\nThat's the second time a door was slammed in your face by the Church.\nIs it? I don't remember.\nStephen Carey told you and your father you couldn't and closed the door in your face. Do you remember that?\nI do.\nAnd now Brother Murray slams the door in your face. I don't mind. I want to get a job.\nHer face tightens and she's angry. You are never to\nbe an altar boy\nlet anybody\nslam the door in your face again. Do you hear me?\nShe starts to cry by the fire, Oh, God, I didn't bring ye into the\nworld to be a family of messenger boys.\nI don't know what to do or say, I'm so relieved I don't have to\nstay in school for five or six more years. I'm free.\nI'm thirteen going on fourteen and it's June, the last month of school forever. Mam takes me to see the priest, Dr. Cowpar, about getting a job as telegram boy. The supervisor in the post office, Mrs. O'Connell, says, Do you know how to cycle, and I lie that I do. She says I can't start till I'm fourteen so come back in August.\nMr. O'Halloran tells the class it's a disgrace that boys like McCourt, Clarke, Kennedy, have to hew wood and draw water. He is disgusted by this free and independent Ireland that keeps a class system foisted on us by the English, that we are throwing our talented children on the dungheap.\nYou must get out of this country, boys. Go to America, McCourt. Do you hear me?\nI do, sir.\nPriests come to the school to recruit us for the foreign missions, Redemptorists, Franciscans, Holy Ghost Fathers, all converting the distant heathen. I ignore them. I'm going to America till one priest catches my attention. He says he comes from the order of the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic Bedouin tribes and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion.\nI ask for the application.\nI will need a letter from the parish priest and a physical examination by my family doctor. The parish priest writes the letter on the spot. He would have been glad to see me go last year. The doctor says, What's this?\nThat's an application to join the White Fathers, missionaries to the nomadic tribes of the Sahara and chaplains to the French Foreign Legion.\nOh, yeh? French Foreign Legion, is it? Do you know the preferred form of transportation in the Sahara Desert?\nTrains?\nNo. It's the camel. Do you know what a camel is?\nIt has a hump. It has more than a hump. It has a nasty, mean\ndisposition and its teeth are green with gangrene and it bites. Do you know where it bites?\nIn the Sahara?\nNo, you omadhaun. It bites your shoulder, rips it right off. Leaves you standing there tilted in the Sahara. How would you like that, eh? And what class of a spectacle you'd be strolling down the street, lopsided in Limerick. What girl in her right mind will look at an ex-White Father with one miserable scrawny shoulder? And look at your eyes. They're bad enough here in Limerick. In the Sahara they'll fester and rot and fall out of your head. How old are you?\nThirteen.\nGo home to your mother.\nIt's not our house and we don't feel free in it the way we did in\nRoden Lane, up in Italy or down in Ireland. When Laman comes home he wants to read in his bed or sleep and we have to be quiet. We stay in the streets till after dark and when we come inside there's nothing to do but go to bed and read a book if we have a candle or paraffin oil for the lamp.\nMam tells us go to bed, she'll be after us in a minute as soon as she climbs to the loft with Laman's last mug of tea. We often fall asleep before she goes up but there are nights we hear them talking, grunting, moaning. There are nights when she never comes down and Michael and Alphie have the big bed to themselves. Malachy says she stays up there because it's too hard for her to climb down in the dark.\nHe's only twelve and he doesn't understand.\nI'm thirteen and I think they're at the excitement up there.\nI know about the excitement and I know it's a sin but how can it be\na sin if it comes to me in a dream where American girls pose in swimming suits on the screen at the Lyric Cinema and I wake up pushing and pumping? It's a sin when you're wide awake and going at yourself the way the boys talked about it in Leamy's schoolyard after Mr. O'Dea roared the Sixth Commandment at us, Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery, which means impure thoughts, impure words, impure deeds, and that's what adultery is, Dirty Things in General.\nOne Redemptorist priest barks at us all the time about the Sixth Commandment. He says impurity is so grave a sin the Virgin Mary turns her face away and weeps.\nAnd why does she weep, boys? She weeps because of you and what you are doing to her Beloved Son. She weeps when she looks down the long dreary vista of time and beholds in horror the spectacle of Limerick boys defiling themselves, polluting themselves, interfering with themselves, abusing themselves, soiling their young bodies, which are the temples of the Holy Ghost. Our Lady weeps over these abominations knowing that every time you interfere with yourself you nail to the cross her Beloved Son, that once more you hammer into His dear head the crown of thorns, that you reopen those ghastly wounds. In an agony of thirst He hangs on the cross and what is He offered by those perfidious Romans? A lavatory sponge plunged into vinegar and gall and thrust into His poor mouth, a mouth that moves rarely except to pray, to pray even for you, boys, even for you who nailed Him to that cross. Consider Our Lord's suffering. Consider the crown of thorns. Consider a small pin driven into your skull, the agony of the piercing. Consider then twenty thorns driven into your head. Reflect, meditate on the nails tearing His hands, His feet. Could you endure a fraction of that agony? Take that pin again, that mere pin. Force it into your side. Enlarge that sensation a hundredfold and you are penetrated by that awful lance. Oh, boys, the devil wants your souls. He wants you with him in hell and know this, that every time you interfere with yourself, every time you succumb to the vile sin of self- abuse you not only nail Christ to the cross you take another step closer to hell itself. Retreat from the abyss, boys. Resist the devil and keep your hands to yourself.\nI can't stop interfering with myself. I pray to the Virgin Mary and tell her I'm sorry I put her Son back on the cross and I'll never do it again but I can't help myself and swear I'll go to confession and after that, surely after that, I'll never never do it again. I don't want to go to hell with devils chasing me for eternity jabbing me with hot pitchforks.\nThe priests of Limerick have no patience with the likes of me. I go to confession and they hiss that I'm not in a proper spirit of repentance, that if I were I'd give up this hideous sin. I go from church to church looking for an easy priest till Paddy Clohessy tells me there's one in the Dominican church who's ninety years old and deaf as a turnip. Every few weeks the old priest hears my confession and mumbles that I should pray for him. Sometimes he falls asleep and I don't have the heart to wake him up so I go to Communion the next day without penance or absolution. It's not my fault if priests fall asleep on me and surely I'm in a state of grace just for going to confession. Then one day the little panel in the confession box slides back and it's not my man at all, it's a young priest with a big ear like a seashell. He'll surely hear everything.\nBless me, Father, for I have sinned, it's a fortnight since my last confession.\nAnd what have you done since then, my child?\nI hit my brother, I went on the mooch from school, I lied to my mother.\nYes, my child, and what else?\nI \u2013 I - I did dirty things, Father.\nAh, my child, was that with yourself or with another or with some class of beast?\nSome class of beast. I never heard of a sin like that before. This priest must be from the country and if he is he's opening up new worlds to me.\nThe night before I'm to go to Killaloe Laman Griffin comes home drunk and eats a great bag of fish and chips at the table. He tells Mam boil water for tea and when she says she has no coal or turf he yells at her and calls her a great lump living free under his roof with her pack of brats. He throws money at me to go to the shop for a few sods of turf and wood for kindling. I don't want to go. I want to hit him for the way he treats my mother but if I say anything he won't let me have the bicycle tomorrow after I've waited three weeks.\nWhen Mam gets the fire going and boils the water I remind him of his promise to loan me the bike.\nDid you empty the chamber pot today?\nOh, I forgot. I'll do it this minute.\nHe shouts, You didn't empty my damn chamber pot. I promise you the\nbike. I give you tuppence a week to run messages for me and empty the chamber pot and you stand there with your thick gob hanging out and tell me you didn't do it.\nI'm sorry. I forgot. I'll do it now.\nYou will, will you? And how do you think you'll get up to the loft? Are you going to pull the table out from under my fish and chips?\nMam says, Sure, he was at school all day and he had to go to the doctor for his eyes.\nWell, you can bloody well forget about the bicycle. You didn't live up to the bargain.\nBut he couldn't do it, says Mam.\nHe tells her shut up and mind her own business and she goes quiet by the fire. He goes back to his fish and chips but I tell him again, You promised me. I emptied that chamber pot and did your messages for three weeks.\nShut up and go to bed.\nYou can't tell me go to bed. You're not my father, and you promised\nme.\nI'm telling you, as sure as God made little apples, that if I get\nup from this table you'll be calling for your patron saint. You promised me.\nHe pushes the chair back from the table. He stumbles toward me and sticks his finger between my eyes. I'm telling you shut your gob, scabby\neyes.\nI won't. You promised me.\nHe punches my shoulders and when I won't stop moves to my head. My\nmother jumps up, crying, and tries to pull him away. He punches and kicks me into the bedroom but I keep saying, You promised me. He knocks me to my mother's bed and punches till I cover my face and head with my arms.\nI'll kill you, you little shit.\nMam is screaming and pulling at him till he falls backward into the kitchen. She says, Come on, oh, come on. Eat your fish and chips. He's only a child. He'll get over it. I hear him go back to his chair and pull it to the table.\nI hear him snuffle and slurp when he eats and drinks. Hand me the matches, he says. By Jesus, I need a fag after that. There's a put-put sound when he puffs on the cigarette and a whimper from my mother.\nHe says, I'm going to bed, and with the drink in him it takes him a while to climb the chair to the table, pull up the chair, climb to the loft. The bed squeaks under him and he grunts when he pulls off his boots and drops them to the floor.\nI can hear Mam crying when she blows into the globe of the paraffin oil lamp and everything goes dark. After what happened she'll surely want to get into her own bed and I'm ready to go to the small one against the wall. Instead, there's the sound of her climbing the chair, the table, the chair, crying up into the loft and telling Laman Griffin, He's only a boy, tormented with his eyes, and when Laman says, He's a little shit and I want him out of the house, she cries and begs till there's whispering and grunting and moaning and nothing.\nIn awhile they're snoring in the loft and my brothers are asleep around me. I can't stay in this house for if Laman Griffin comes at me again I'll take a knife to his neck. I don't know what to do or where to go.\nI leave the house and follow the streets from the Sarsfield Barracks to the Monument Caf\u00e9. I dream of how I'll get back at Laman some day. I'll go to America and see Joe Louis. I'll tell him my troubles and he'll understand because he comes from a poor family. He'll show me how to build up my muscles, how to hold my hands and use my feet. He'll show me how to dig my chin into my shoulder the way he does and how to let go with a right uppercut that will send Laman flying. I'll drag Laman to the graveyard at Mungret where his family and Mam's family are buried and I'll cover him with earth all the way to his chin so that he won't be able to move and he'll beg for his life and I'll say, End of the road, Laman, you're going to meet your Maker, and he'll beg and beg while I trickle dirt on his face till it's covered completely and he's gasping and asking God for forgiveness for not giving me the bike and punching me all over the house and doing the excitement with my mother and I'll be laughing away because he's not in a state of grace after the excitement and he's going to hell as sure as God made little apples as he used to say himself.\nThe streets are dark and I have to keep an eye out in case I might be lucky like Malachy long ago and find fish and chips dropped by drunken soldiers. There's nothing on the ground. If I find my uncle, Ab Sheehan, he might give me some of his Friday night fish and chips, but they tell me in the caf\u00e9 he came and went already. I'm thirteen now so I don't call him Uncle Pat anymore. I call him Ab or The Abbot like everybody else. Surely if I go to Grandma's house he'll give me a piece of bread or something and maybe he'll let me stay the night. I can tell him I'll be working in a few weeks delivering telegrams and getting big tips at the post office and ready to pay my own way.\nHe's sitting up in bed finishing his fish and chips, dropping to the floor the Limerick Leader they were wrapped in, wiping his mouth and hands with the blanket. He looks at me, That face is all swole. Did you fall on that face?\nI tell him I did because there's no use telling him anything else. He wouldn't understand. He says, You can stay in me mother's bed tonight. You can't walk the streets with that face and them two red eyes in your head.\nHe says there's no food in the house, not a scrap of bread, and when he falls asleep I take the greasy newspaper from the floor. I lick the front page, which is all advertisements for films and dances in the city. I lick the headlines. I lick the great attacks of Patton and Montgomery in France and Germany. I lick the war in the Pacific. I lick the obituaries and the sad memorial poems, the sports pages, the market prices of eggs butter and bacon. I suck the paper till there isn't a smidgen of grease.\nI wonder what I'll do tomorrow.\nXIV\nIn the morning The Abbot gives me the money to go to Kathleen O'Connell's for bread, margarine, tea, milk. He boils water on the gas ring and tells me I can have a mug of tea and, Go aisy with the sugar, I'm not a millionaire. You can have a cut o' bread but don't make it too thick.\nIt's July and school is over forever. In a few weeks I'll be delivering telegrams at the post office, working like a man. In the weeks I'm idle I can do anything I like, get up in the morning, stay in bed, take long walks out the country like my father, wander around Limerick. If I had the money I'd go over to the Lyric Cinema, eat sweets, see Errol Flynn conquering everyone in sight. I can read the English and Irish papers The Abbot brings home or I can use the library cards of Laman Griffin and my mother till I'm found out.\nMam sends Michael with a milk bottle of warm tea, a few cuts of bread smeared with dripping, a note to say Laman Griffin isn't angry anymore and I can come back. Michael says, Are you coming home, Frankie?\nNo.\nAh, do, Frankie. Come on.\nI live here now. I'm never going back.\nBut Malachy is gone to the army and you're here and I have no big\nbrother. All the boys have big brothers and I only have Alphie. He's not even four and can't talk right.\nI can't go back. I'm never going back. You can come here any time you like.\nHis eyes glint with tears and that gives me such a pain in my heart I want to say, All right, I'll come with you. I'm only saying that. I know I'll never be able to face Laman Griffin again and I don't know if I can look at my mother. I watch Michael go up the lane with the sole of his shoe broken and clacking along the pavement. When I start that job at the post office I'll buy him shoes so I will. I'll give him an egg and take him to the Lyric Cinema for the film and the sweets and then we'll go to Naughton's and eat fish and chips till our bellies are sticking out a mile. I'll get money some day for a house or a flat with electric light and a lavatory and beds with sheets blankets pillows like the rest of the world. We'll have breakfast in a bright kitchen with flowers dancing in a garden beyond, delicate cups and saucers, eggcups, eggs soft in the yolk and ready to melt the rich creamery butter, a teapot with a cozy on it, toast with butter and marmalade galore. We'll take our time and listen to music from the BBC or the American Armed Forces Network. I'll buy proper clothes for the whole family so our arses won't be hanging out of our pants and we won't have the shame. The thought of the shame brings a pain\nin my heart and starts me sniffling. The Abbot says, What's up with you? Didn't you have your bread? Didn't you have your tay? What more do you want? 'Tis an egg you'll be lookin' for next.\nThere's no use talking to someone who was dropped on his head and sells papers for a living.\nHe complains he can't be feeding me forever and I'll have to get my own bread and tea. He doesn't want to come home and find me reading in the kitchen with the electric lightbulb blazing away. He can read numbers so he can and when he goes out to sell papers he reads the electric meter so he'll know how much I used and if I don't stop turning on that light he'll take the fuse out and carry it in his pocket and if I put another fuse in he'll have the electricity pulled out altogether and go back to gas, which was good enough for his poor dead mother and will surely suit him for all he does is sit up in the bed to eat his fish and chips and count his money before he goes to sleep.\nI get up early like Dad and go on long walks into the country. I walk around the graveyard in the old abbey at Mungret where my mother's relations are buried and I go up the boreen to the Norman castle at Carrigogunnell where Dad brought me twice. I climb to the top and Ireland is spread out before me, the Shannon shining its way to the Atlantic. Dad told me this castle was built hundreds of years ago and if you wait for the larks to stop their singing over there you can hear the Normans below hammering and talking and getting ready for battle. Once he brought me here in the dark so that we could hear Norman and Irish voices down through the centuries and I heard them. I did.\nSometimes I'm up there alone on the heights of Carrigogunnell and there are voices of Norman girls from olden times laughing and singing in French and when I see them in my mind I'm tempted and I climb to the very top of the castle where once there was a tower and there in full view of Ireland I interfere with myself and spurt all over Carrigogunnell and fields beyond.\nThat's a sin I could never tell a priest. Climbing to great heights and going at yourself before all of Ireland is surely worse than doing it in a private place with yourself or with another or with some class of a beast. Somewhere down there in the fields or along the banks of the Shannon a boy or a milkmaid might have looked up and seen me in my sin and if they did I'm doomed because the priests are always saying that anyone who exposes a child to sin will have a millstone tied around his neck and be cast into the sea.\nStill, the thought of someone watching me brings on the excitement again. I wouldn't want a small boy to be watching me. No, no, that would surely lead to the millstone, but if there was a milkmaid gawking up she'd surely get excited and go at herself though I don't know if girls can go at themselves when they don't have anything to go at. No equipment, as Mikey Molloy used to say.\nI wish that old deaf Dominican priest would come back so that I could tell him my troubles with the excitement but he's dead now and I'll have to face a priest who'll go on about the millstone and the doom.\nDoom. That's the favorite word of every priest in Limerick.\nI walk back along O'Connell Avenue and Ballinacurra where people have their bread and milk delivered early to their doorsteps and surely there's no harm if I borrow a loaf or a bottle with every intention of giving it back when I get my job at the post office. I'm not stealing, I'm borrowing, and that's not a mortal sin. Besides, I stood on top of a\ncastle this morning and committed a sin far worse than stealing bread and milk and if you commit one sin you might as well commit a few more because you get the same sentence in hell. One sin, eternity. A dozen sins, eternity.\nMight as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, as my mother would say. I drink the odd pint of milk and leave the bottle so that the milkman won't be blamed for not delivering. I like milkmen because one of them gave me two broken eggs which I swallowed raw with bits of shells and all. He said I'd grow up powerful if I had nothing else but two eggs in a pint of porter every day. Everything you need is in the egg and everything you want is in the pint.\nSome houses get better bread than others. It costs more and that's what I take. I feel sorry for the rich people who will get up in the morning and go to the door and find their bread missing but I can't let myself starve to death. If I starve I'll never have the strength for my telegram boy job at the post office, which means I'll have no money to put back all that bread and milk and no way of saving to go to America and if I can't go to America I might as well jump into the River Shannon. It's only a few weeks till I get my first wages in the post office and surely these rich people won't collapse with the hunger till then. They can always send the maid out for more. That's the difference between the poor and the rich. The poor can't send out for more because there's no money to send out for more and if there was they wouldn't have a maid to send. It's the maids I have to worry about. I have to be careful when I borrow the milk and the bread and they're at the front doors polishing knobs, knockers and letter boxes. If they see me they'll be running to the woman of the house, Oh, madam, madam, there's an urchin beyant that's makin' off with all the milk and bread.\nBeyant. Maids talk like that because they're all from the country, Mullingar heifers, says Paddy Clohessy's uncle, beef to the heels, and they wouldn't give you the steam of their piss.\nI bring home the bread and even if The Abbot is surprised he doesn't say, Where did you get it? because he was dropped on his head and that knocks the curiosity out of you. He just looks at me with his big eyes that are blue in the middle and yellow all around and slurps his tea from the great cracked mug his mother left behind. He tells me, That's me mug and don't be drinkin' your tay oush of ish.\nOush of ish. That's the Limerick slum talk that always worried Dad. He said, I don't want my sons growing up in a Limerick lane saying, Oush of ish. It's common and low-class. Say out of it properly.\nAnd Mam said, I hope it keeps fine for you but you're not doing much to get us oush of ish.\nOut beyond Ballinacurra I climb orchard walls for apples. If there's a dog I move on because I don't have Paddy Clohessy's way of talking to them. Farmers come at me but they're always slow in their rubber boots and even if they jump on a bicycle to chase me I jump over walls where they can't take a bike.\nThe Abbot knows where I got the apples. If you grow up in the lanes of Limerick you're bound to rob the odd orchard sooner or later. Even if you hate apples you have to rob orchards or your pals will say you're a sissy.\nI always offer The Abbot an apple but he won't eat it because of the scarcity of teeth in his head. He has five left and he won't risk leaving them in an apple. If I cut the apple into slices he still won't\neat it because that's not the proper way to eat an apple. That's what he says and if I say, You slice bread before you eat it, don't you? he says, Apples is apples and bread is bread.\nThat's how you talk when you're dropped on your head.\nMichael comes again with warm tea in a milk bottle and two cuts of fried bread. I tell him I don't need it anymore. Tell Mam I'm taking care of myself and I don't need her tea and fried bread, thank you very much. Michael is delighted when I give him an apple and I tell him come every second day and he can have more. That stops him from asking me to go back to Laman Griffin's and I'm glad it stops his tears.\nThere's a market down in Irishtown where the farmers come on Saturdays with their vegetables, hens, eggs, butter. If I'm there early they'll give me a few pennies for helping unload their carts or motor cars. At the end of the day they'll give me vegetables they can't sell, anything crushed, bruised or rotten in parts. One farmer's wife always gives me cracked eggs and tells me, Fry them eggs tomorrow when you come back from Mass in a state of grace for if you ate them eggs with a sin on your sowl they'll stick in your gullet, so they will.\nShe's a farmer's wife and that's how they talk.\nI'm not much better than a beggar now myself the way I stand at the doors of fish and chip shops when they're closing in hopes they might have burnt chips left over or bits of fish floating around in the grease. If they're in a hurry the shop owners will give me the chips and a sheet of paper for wrapping.\nThe paper I like is the News of the World. It's banned in Ireland but people sneak it in from England for the shocking pictures of girls in swimming suits that are almost not there. Then there are stories of people committing all kinds of sins you wouldn't find in Limerick, getting divorces, committing adultery.\nAdultery. I still have to find out what that word means, look it up in the library. I'm sure it's worse than what the masters taught us, bad thoughts, bad words, bad deeds. I take my chips home and get into bed like The Abbot. If he has a few pints taken he sits up eating his chips from the Limerick Leader and singing \"The Road to Rasheen. \" I eat my chips. I lick the News of the World. I lick the stories about people doing shocking things. I lick the girls in their bathing suits and when there's nothing left to lick I look at the girls till The Abbot blows out the light and I'm committing a mortal sin under the blanket.\nI can go to the library any time with Mam's card or Laman Griffin's. I'll never be caught because Laman is too lazy to get out of bed on a Saturday and Mam will never go near a library with the shame of her clothes.\nMiss O'Riordan smiles. The Lives of the Saints are waiting for you, Frank. Volumes and volumes. Butler, O'Hanlon, Baring Gould. I've told the head librarian all about you and she's so pleased she's ready to give you your own grown-up card. Isn't that wonderful?\nThanks, Miss O'Riordan.\nI'm reading all about St. Brigid, virgin, February first. She was so beautiful that men from all over Ireland panted to marry her and her father wanted her to marry someone important. She didn't want to marry anyone so she prayed to God for help and He caused her eye to melt in her head so that it dribbled down her cheek and left such a great welt the men of Ireland lost interest.\nThen there's St. Wilgefortis, virgin martyr, July twentieth. Her mother had nine children, all at the same time, four sets of twins and Wilgefortis the odd one, all winding up martyrs for the faith. Wilgefortis was beautiful and her father wanted to marry her off to the King of Sicily. Wilgefortis was desperate and God helped her by allowing a beard and a mustache to grow on her face, which made the King of Sicily think twice but sent her father into such a rage he had her crucified beard and all.\nSt. Wilgefortis is the one you pray to if you're an Englishwoman with a troublesome husband.\nThe priests never tell us about virgin martyrs like St. Agatha, February fifth. February is a powerful month for virgin martyrs. Sicilian pagans ordered Agatha to give up her faith in Jesus and like all the virgin martyrs she said, Nay. They tortured her, stretched her on the rack, tore her sides with iron hooks, burned her with blazing torches, and she said, Nay, I will not deny Our Lord. They crushed her breasts and cut them off but when they rolled her over hot coals it was more than she could bear so she expired, giving praise.\nVirgin martyrs always died singing hymns and giving praise not minding one bit if lions tore big chunks from their sides and gobbled them on the spot.\nHow is it the priests never told us about St. Ursula and her eleven thousand maiden martyrs, October twenty-first? Her father wanted her to marry a pagan king but she said, I'll go away for awhile, three years, and think about it. So off she goes with her thousand noble ladies-in- waiting and their companions, ten thousand. They sailed around for awhile and traipsed through various countries till they stopped in Cologne where the chief of the Huns asked Ursula to marry him. Nay, she said, and the Huns killed her and the maidens with her. Why couldn't she say yes and save the lives of eleven thousand virgins? Why did virgin martyrs have to be so stubborn?\nI like St. Moling, an Irish bishop. He didn't live in a palace like the bishop of Limerick. He lived in a tree and when other saints visited him for dinner they would sit around on branches like birds having a grand time with their water and dry bread. He was walking along one day and a leper said, Hoy, St. Moling, where are you going? I'm going to Mass, says St. Moling. Well, I'd like to go to Mass too, so why don't you hoist me up on your back and carry me? St. Moling did but he no sooner had the leper up on his back than the leper started to complain. Your hair shirt, he said, is hard on my sores, take it off. St. Moling took off the shirt and off they went again. Then the leper says, I need to blow my nose. St. Moling says, I don't have any class of a handkerchief, use your hand. The leper says, I can't hold on to you and blow my nose at the same time. All right, says St. Moling, you can blow into my hand. That won't do, says the leper, I barely have a hand left with the leprosy and I can't hold on and blow into your hand. If you were a proper saint you'd twist around here and suck the stuff out of my head. St. Moling didn't want to suck the leper's snot but he did and offered it up and praised God for the privilege.\nI could understand my father sucking the bad stuff out of Michael's head when he was a baby and desperate but I don't understand why God wanted St. Moling to go around sucking the snot out of lepers' heads. I don't understand God at all and even if I'd like to be a saint and have\neveryone adore me I'd never suck the snot of a leper. I'd like to be a saint but if that's what you have to do I think I'll stay the way I am.\nStill, I'm ready to spend my life in this library reading about virgins and virgin martyrs till I get into trouble with Miss O'Riordan over a book someone left on the table. The author is Lin Y\u00fctang. Anyone can tell this is a Chinese name and I'm curious to know what the Chinese talk about. It's a book of essays about love and the body and one of his words sends me to the dictionary. Turgid. He says, The male organ of copulation becomes turgid and is inserted into the receptive female orifice.\nTurgid. The dictionary says swollen and that's what I am, standing there looking at the dictionary because I know now what Mikey Molloy was talking about all along, that we're no different from the dogs that get stuck in each other in the streets and it's shocking to think of all the mothers and fathers doing the likes of this.\nMy father lied to me for years about the Angel on the Seventh Step.\nMiss O'Riordan wants to know what word I'm looking for. She always looks worried when I'm at the dictionary so I tell her I'm looking for canonize or beatific or any class of a religious word.\nAnd what's this? she says. This is not the Lives of the Saints.\nShe picks up Lin Y\u00fctang and starts reading the page where I left the book face down on the table.\nMother o' God. Is this what you were reading? I saw this in your hand.\nWell, I-I-only wanted to see if the Chinese, if the Chinese, ah, had any saints.\nOh, indeed, you did. This is disgraceful. Filth. No wonder the Chinese are the way they are. But what could you expect of slanty eyes and yellow skin and you, now that I look at you, have a bit of the slanty eye yourself. You are to leave this library at once.\nBut I'm reading the Lives of the Saints.\nOut or I'll call the head librarian and she'll have the guards on you. Out. You should be running to the priest and confessing your sins. Out, and before you go hand me the library cards of your poor mother and Mr. Griffin. I have a good mind to write to your poor mother and I would if I thought it wouldn't destroy her entirely. Lin Y\u00fctang, indeed. Out.\nThere's no use trying to talk to librarians when they're in that state. You could stand there for an hour telling them all you've read about Brigid and Wilgefortis and Agatha and Ursula and the maiden martyrs but all they think about is one word on one page of Lin Y\u00fctang.\nThe People's Park is behind the library. It's a sunny day, the grass is dry, and I'm worn out begging for chips and putting up with librarians who get into a state over turgid and I'm looking at the clouds drifting above the monument and drifting off myself all turgid till I'm having a dream about virgin martyrs in bathing suits in the News of the World pelting Chinese writers with sheeps' bladders and I wake up in a state of excitement with something hot and sticky pumping out of me oh God my male organ of copulation sticking out a mile people in the park giving me curious looks and mothers telling their children come over here love come away from that fella someone should call the guards on him.\nThe day before my fourteenth birthday I see myself in the glass in Grandma's sideboard. The way I look how can I ever start my job at the post office. Everything is torn, shirt, gansey, short pants, stockings, and my shoes are ready to fall off my feet entirely. Relics of oul'\ndecency, my mother would call them. If my clothes are bad I'm worse. No matter how I drench my hair under the tap it sticks out in all directions. The best cure for standing up hair is spit, only it's hard to spit on your own head. You have to let go with a good one up in the air and duck to catch it on your poll. My eyes are red and oozing yellow, there are matching red and yellow pimples all over my face and my front teeth are so black with rot I'll never be able to smile in my life.\nI have no shoulders and I know the whole world admires shoulders. When a man dies in Limerick the women always say, Grand man he was, shoulders that big and wide he wouldn't come in the door for you, had to come in sideways. When I die they'll say, Poor little divil, died without a sign of a shoulder. I wish I had some sign of a shoulder so that people would know I was at least fourteen years of age. All the boys in Leamy's had shoulders except for Fintan Slattery and I don't want to be like him with no shoulders and knees worn away from prayer. If I had any money left I'd light a candle to St. Francis and ask him if there's any chance God could be persuaded to perform a miracle on my shoulders. Or if I had a stamp I could write to Joe Louis and say, Dear Joe, Is there any chance you could tell me where you got your powerful shoulders even though you were poor?\nI have to look decent for my job so I take off all my clothes and stand naked in the backyard washing them under the tap with a bar of carbolic soap. I hang them on Grandma's clothesline, shirt, gansey, pants, stockings, and pray to God it won't rain, pray they'll be dry for tomorrow, which is the start of my life.\nI can't go anywhere in my pelt so I stay in bed all day reading old newspapers, getting excited with the girls in the News of the World and thanking God for the drying sun. The Abbot comes home at five and makes tea downstairs and even though I'm hungry I know he'll grumble if I ask him for anything. He knows the one thing that worries me is he might go to Aunt Aggie and complain I'm staying in Grandma's house and sleeping in her bed and if Aunt Aggie hears that she'll come over and throw me into the street.\nHe hides the bread when he's finished and I can never find it. You would think that one who was never dropped on his head would be able to find the hidden bread of one who was dropped on his head. Then I realize if the bread is not in the house he must take it with him in the pocket of the overcoat he wears winter and summer. The minute I hear him clumping from the kitchen to the backyard lavatory I run downstairs, pull the loaf from the pocket, cut off a thick slice, back into the pocket, up the stairs and into bed. He can never say a word, never accuse me. You'd have to be a thief of the worst class to steal one slice of bread and no one would ever believe him, not even Aunt Aggie. Besides, she'd bark at him and say, What are you doing anyway going around with a loaf of bread in your pocket? That's no place for a loaf of bread.\nI chew the bread slowly. One mouthful every fifteen minutes will make it last and if I wash it down with water the bread will swell in my belly and give me the full feeling.\nI look out the back window to make sure the evening sun is drying my clothes. Other backyards have lines with clothes that are bright and colorful and dance in the wind. Mine hang from the line like dead dogs.\nThe sun is bright but it's cold and damp in the house and I wish I had something to wear in the bed. I have no other clothes and if I touch anything of The Abbot's he'll surely run to Aunt Aggie. All I can find in\nthe wardrobe is Grandma's old black woolen dress. You're not supposed to wear your Grandmother's old dress when she's dead and you're a boy but what does it matter if it keeps you warm and you're in bed under the blankets where no one will ever know. The dress has the smell of old dead grandmother and I worry she might rise from the grave and curse me before the whole family and all assembled. I pray to St. Francis, ask him to keep her in the grave where she belongs, promise him a candle when I start my job, remind him the robe he wore himself wasn't too far from a dress and no one ever tormented him over it and fall asleep with the image of his face in my dream.\nThe worst thing in the world is to be sleeping in your dead grandmother's bed wearing her black dress when your uncle The Abbot falls on his arse outside South's pub after a night of drinking pints and people who can't mind their own business rush to Aunt Aggie's house to tell her so that she gets Uncle Pa Keating to help her carry The Abbot home and upstairs to where you're sleeping and she barks at you, What are you doin' in this house, in that bed? Get up and put on the kettle for tea for your poor uncle Pat that fell down, and when you don't move she pulls the blankets and falls backward like one seeing a ghost and yelling Mother o' God what are you doin' in me dead mother's dress?\nThat's the worst thing of all because it's hard to explain that you're getting ready for the big job in your life, that you washed your clothes, they're drying abroad on the line, and it was so cold you had to wear the only thing you could find in the house, and it's even harder to talk to Aunt Aggie when The Abbot is groaning in the bed, Me feet is like a fire, put water on me feet, and Uncle Pa Keating is covering his mouth with his hand and collapsing against the wall laughing and telling you that you look gorgeous and black suits you and would you ever straighten your hem. You don't know what to do when Aunt Aggie tells you, Get out of that bed and put the kettle on downstairs for tea for your poor uncle. Should you take off the dress and put on a blanket or should you go as you are? One minute she's screaming, What are you doin' in me poor mother's dress? the next she's telling you put on that bloody kettle. I tell her I washed my clothes for the big job.\nWhat big job?\nTelegram boy at the post office.\nShe says if the post office is hiring the likes of you they must be\nin a desperate way altogether, go down and put on that kettle.\nThe next worse thing is to be out in the backyard filling the\nkettle from the tap with the moon beaming away and Kathleen Purcell from next door perched up on the wall looking for her cat. God, Frankie McCourt, what are you doin' in your grandmother's dress? and you have to stand there in the dress with the kettle in your hand and explain how you washed your clothes which are hanging there on the line for all to see and you were so cold in the bed you put on your grandmother's dress and your uncle Pat, The Abbot, fell down and was brought home by Aunt Aggie and her husband, Pa Keating, and she drove you into the backyard to fill this kettle and you'll take off this dress as soon as ever your clothes are dry because you never had any desire to go through life in your dead grandmother's dress.\nNow Kathleen Purcell lets out a scream, falls off the wall, forgets the cat, and you can hear her giggling into her blind mother, Mammy, Mammy, wait till I tell you about Frankie McCourt abroad in the backyard in his dead grandmother's dress. You know that once Kathleen Purcell gets\na bit of scandal the whole lane will know it before morning and you might as well stick your head out the window and make a general announcement about yourself and the dress problem.\nBy the time the kettle boils The Abbot is asleep from the drink and Aunt Aggie says she and Uncle Pa will have a drop of tea themselves and she doesn't mind if I have a drop myself. Uncle Pa says on second thought the black dress could be the cassock of a Dominican priest and he goes down on his knees and says, Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Aunt Aggie says, Get up, you oul' eejit, and stop makin' a feck of religion. Then she says, And you what are you doin' in this house?\nI can't tell her about Mam and Laman Griffin and the excitement in the loft. I tell her I was thinking of staying here a while because of the great distance from Laman Griffin's house to the post office and as soon as I get on my feet we'll surely find a decent place and we'll all move on, my mother and brothers and all.\nWell, she says, that's more than your father would do.\nXV\nIt's hard to sleep when you know the next day you're fourteen and starting your first job as a man. The Abbot wakes at dawn moaning. Would I ever make him some tay and if I do I can have a big cut of bread from the half loaf in his pocket which he was keeping there out of the way of the odd rat and if I look in Grandma's gramophone where she used to keep the records I'll find a jar of jam.\nHe can't read, he can't write, but he knows where to hide the jam.\nI bring The Abbot his tea and bread and make some for myself. I put on my damp clothes and get into the bed hoping that if I stay there the clothes will dry from my own heat before I go to work. Mam always says it's the damp clothes that give you the consumption and an early grave. The Abbot is sitting up telling me he has a terrible pain in his head from a dream where I was wearing his poor mother's black dress and she flying around screaming, Sin, sin, 'tis a sin. He finishes his tea and falls into a snore sleep and I wait for his clock to say half-past eight, time to get up and be at the post office at nine even if the clothes are still damp on my skin.\nOn my way out I wonder why Aunt Aggie is coming down the lane. She must be coming to see if The Abbot is dead or needing a doctor. She says, What time do you have to be at that job?\nNine.\nAll right.\nShe turns and walks with me to the post office on Henry Street. She\ndoesn't say a word and I wonder if she's going to the post office to denounce me for sleeping in my grandmother's bed and wearing her black dress. She says, Go up and tell them your aunt is down here waiting for you and you'll be an hour late. If they want to argue I'll go up and argue.\nWhy do I have to be an hour late?\nDo what you're bloody well told.\nThere are telegram boys sitting on a bench along a wall. There are\ntwo women at a desk, one fat, one thin. The thin one says, Yes? My name is Frank McCourt, miss, and I'm here to start work.\nWhat kind of work would that be now?\nTelegram boy, miss.\nThe thin one cackles, Oh, God, I thought you were here to clean the\nlavatories.\nNo, miss. My mother brought a note from the priest, Dr. Cowpar, and\nthere's supposed to be a job.\nOh, there is, is there? And do you know what day this is?\nI do, miss. 'Tis my birthday. I'm fourteen.\nIsn't that grand, says the fat woman. Today is Thursday, says the\nthin woman.\nYour job starts on Monday. Go away and wash yourself and come back then.\nThe telegram boys along the wall are laughing. I don't know why but I feel my face turning hot. I tell the women, Thank you, and on the way out I hear the thin one, Jesus above, Maureen, who dragged in that specimen? and they laugh along with the telegram boys.\nAunt Aggie says, Well? and I tell her I don't start till Monday. She says my clothes are a disgrace and what did I wash them in.\nCarbolic soap.\nThey smell like dead pigeons and you're making a laughingstock of the whole family.\nShe takes me to Roche's Stores and buys me a shirt, a gansey, a pair of short pants, two pairs of stockings and a pair of summer shoes on sale. She gives me two shillings to have tea and a bun for my birthday. She gets on the bus to go back up O'Connell Street too fat and lazy to walk. Fat and lazy, no son of her own, and still she buys me the clothes for my new job.\nI turn toward Arthur's Quay with the package of new clothes under my arm and I have to stand at the edge of the River Shannon so that the whole world won't see the tears of a man the day he's fourteen.\nMonday morning I'm up early to wash my face and flatten my hair with water and spit. The Abbot sees me in my new clothes. Jaysus, he says, is it gettin' married you are? and goes back to sleep.\nMrs. O'Connell, the fat woman, says, Well, well, aren't we the height of fashion, and the thin one, Miss Barry, says, Did you rob a bank on the weekend? and there's a great laugh from the telegram boys sitting on the bench along the wall.\nI'm told to sit at the end of the bench and wait for my turn to go out with telegrams. Some telegram boys in uniforms are the permanent ones who took the exam. They can stay in the post office forever if they like, take the next exam for postman and then the one for clerk that lets them work inside selling stamps and money orders behind the counter downstairs. The post office gives permanent boys big waterproof capes for the bad weather and they get two weeks holiday every year. Everyone says these are good jobs, steady and pensionable and respectable, and if you get a job like this you never have to worry again in your whole life, so you don't.\nTemporary telegram boys are not allowed to stay in the job beyond the age of sixteen. There are no uniforms, no holidays, the pay is less, and if you stay out sick a day you can be fired. No excuses. There are no waterproof capes. Bring your own raincoat or dodge the raindrops.\nMrs. O'Connell calls me to her desk to give me a black leather belt and pouch. She says there's a great shortage of bicycles so I'll have to walk my first batch of telegrams. I'm to go to the farthest address\nfirst, work my way back, and don't take all day. She's long enough in the post office to know how long it takes to deliver six telegrams even by foot. I'm not to be stopping in pubs or bookies or even home for a cup of tea and if I do I'll be found out. I'm not to be stopping in chapels to say a prayer. If I have to pray do it on the hoof or on the bicycle. If it rains pay no attention. Deliver the telegrams and don't be a sissy.\nOne telegram is addressed to Mrs. Clohessy of Arthur's Quay and that couldn't be anyone but Paddy's mother.\nIs that you, Frankie McCourt? she says. God, I wouldn't know you you're that big. Come in, will you.\nShe's wearing a bright frock with flowers all over and shiny new shoes. There are two children on the floor playing with a toy train. On the table there is a teapot, cups with saucers, a bottle of milk, a loaf of bread, butter, jam. There are two beds over by the window where there were none before. The big bed in the corner is empty and she must know what I'm wondering. He's gone, she says, but he's not dead. Gone t' England with Paddy. Have a cup o' tay an' a bit o' bread. You need it, God help us. You look like one left over from the Famine itself. Ate that bread an' jam an' build yourself up. Paddy always talked about you and Dennis, my poor husband that was in the bed, never got over the day your mother came an' sang the song about the Kerry dancing. He's over in England now making sandwiches in a canteen and sending me a few bob every week. You'd wonder what the English are thinking about when they take a man that has the consumption and give him a job making sandwiches. Paddy has a grand job in a pub in Cricklewood, which is in England. Dennis would still be here if it wasn't for Paddy climbin' the wall for the tongue.\nTongue?\nDennis had the craving, so he did, for a nice sheep's head with a bit of cabbage and a spud so up with me to Barry the butcher with the last few shillings I had. I boiled that head an' sick an' all as he was Dennis couldn't wait for it to be done. He was a demon there in the bed callin' for the head an' when I gave it to him on the plate he was delighted with himself suckin' the marrow outa every inch of that head. Then he finishes an' he says, Mary, where is the tongue?\nWhat tongue? says I.\nThe tongue of this sheep. Every sheep is born with a tongue that lets him go ba ba ba and there's a great lack of tongue in this head. Go up to Barry the butcher and demand it.\nSo up with me to Barry the butcher and he said, That bloody sheep came in here bleatin'an'cryin'so much we cut the tongue from her and thrun it to the dog who gobbled it up and ever since ba bas like a sheep and if he doesn't quit I'll cut his tongue and throw it to the cat.\nBack I go to Dennis and he gets frantic in the bed. I want that tongue, he says. All the nourishment is in the tongue. And what do you think happens next but my Paddy, that was your friend, goes up to Barry the butcher after dark, climbs the wall, cuts the tongue of a sheep's head that's on a hook on the wall and brings it back to his poor father in the bed. Of course I have to boil that tongue with salt galore and Dennis, God love him, ates it, lies back in the bed a minute, throws back the blanket and stands out on his two feet announcing to the world that consumption or no consumption, he's not going to die in that bed, if he's going to die at all it might as well be under a German bomb with him\nmaking a few pounds for his family instead of whining in the bed there beyond.\nShe shows me a letter from Paddy. He's working in his uncle Anthony's pub twelve hours a day, twenty-five shillings a week and every day soup and a sandwich. He's delighted when the Germans come over with the bombs so that he can sleep while the pub is closed. At night he sleeps on the floor of the hallway upstairs. He will send his mother two pounds every month and he's saving the rest to bring her and the family to England where they'll be much better off in one room in Cricklewood than ten rooms in Arthur's Quay. She'll be able to get a job no bother. You'd have to be a sad case not to be able to get a job in a country that's at war especially with Yanks pouring in and spending money right and left. Paddy himself is planning to get a job in the middle of London where Yanks leave tips big enough to feed an Irish family of six for a week.\nMrs. Clohessy says, We have enough money for food and shoes at last, thanks be to God and His Blessed Mother. You'll never guess who Paddy met over there in England fourteen years of age an' workin' like a man. Brendan Kiely, the one ye used to call Question. Workin' he is an' savin' so he can go an' join the Mounties an' ride all over Canada like Nelson Eddy singin' I'll be callin' you ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh. If it wasn't for Hitler we'd all be dead an' isn't that a terrible thing to say. And how's your poor mother, Frankie?\nShe's grand, Mrs. Clohessy.\nNo, she's not. I seen her in the Dispensary and she looks worse than my Dennis did in the bed. You have to mind your poor mother. You look desperate too, Frankie, with them two red eyes starin' outa your head. Here's a little tip for you. Thruppence. Buy yourself a sweet.\nI will, Mrs. Clohessy.\nDo.\n***\nAt the end of the week Mrs. O'Connell hands me the first wages of\nmy life, a pound, my first pound. I run down the stairs and up to O'Connell Street, the main street, where the lights are on and people are going home from work, people like me with wages in their pockets. I want them to know I'm like them, I'm a man, I have a pound. I walk up one side of O'Connell Street and down the other and hope they'll notice me. They don't. I want to wave my pound note at the world so they'll say, There he goes, Frankie McCourt the workingman, with a pound in his pocket.\nIt's Friday night and I can do anything I like. I can have fish and chips and go to the Lyric Cinema. No, no more Lyric. I don't have to sit up in the gods anymore with people all around me cheering on the Indians killing General Custer and the Africans chasing Tarzan all over the jungle. I can go to the Savoy Cinema now, pay sixpence for a seat down front where there's a better class of people eating boxes of chocolates and covering their mouths when they laugh. After the film I can have tea and buns in the restaurant upstairs.\nMichael is across the street calling me. He's hungry and wonders if there's any chance he could go to The Abbot's for a bit of bread and stay there for the night instead of going all the way to Laman Griffin's. I tell him he doesn't have to worry about a bit of bread. We'll go to the Coliseum Caf\u00e9 and have fish and chips, all he wants, lemonade galore, and then we'll go to see Yankee Doodle Dandy with James Cagney and eat two big bars of chocolate. After the film we have tea and buns and we sing\nand dance like Cagney all the way to The Abbot's. Michael says it must be great to be in America where people have nothing else to do but sing and dance. He's half asleep but he says he's going there some day to sing and dance and would I help him go and when he's asleep I start thinking about America and how I have to save money for my fare instead of squandering it on fish and chips and tea and buns. I'll have to save a few shillings from my pound because if I don't I'll be in Limerick forever. I'm fourteen now and if I save something every week surely I should be able to go to America by the time I'm twenty. There are telegrams for offices, shops, factories where there's no hope of a tip. Clerks take the telegrams without a look at you or a thank you. There are telegrams for the respectable people with maids along the Ennis Road and the North Circular Road where there's no hope of a tip. Maids are like clerks, they don't look at you or say thank you. There are telegrams for the houses of priests and nuns and they have maids, too, even if they say poverty is noble. If you waited for tips from priests or nuns you'd die on their doorstep.\nThere are telegrams for people miles outside the city, farmers with muddy yards and dogs who want to eat your legs. There are telegrams for rich people in big houses with gate lodges and miles of land surrounded by walls. The gatekeeper waves you in and you have to cycle for miles up long drives past lawns, flower beds, fountains to reach the big house. If the weather is fine people are playing croquet, the Protestant game, or strolling around, talking and laughing, all decked out in flowery dresses and blazers with crests and golden buttons and you'd never know there was a war on. There are Bentleys and Rolls-Royces parked outside the great front door where a maid tells you go around to the servants' entrance don't you know any better.\nPeople in the big houses have English accents and they don't tip telegram boys.\nThe best people for tips are widows, Protestant ministers' wives and the poor in general. Widows know when the telegram money order is due from the English government and they wait by the window. You have to be careful if they ask you in for a cup of tea because one of the temporary boys, Scrawby Luby, said an old widow of thirty-five had him in for tea and tried to take down his pants and he had to run out of the house though he was really tempted and had to go to confession the next Saturday. He said it was very awkward hopping up on the bike with his thing sticking out but if you cycle very fast and think of the sufferings of the Virgin Mary you'll go soft in no time.\nProtestant ministers' wives would never carry on like Scrawby Luby's old widow unless they're widows themselves. Christy Wallace, who is a permanent telegram boy and ready to be a postman any day, says Protestants don't care what they do even if they're ministers' wives. They're doomed anyway, so what does it matter if they have a bit of a romp with a telegram boy. All the telegram boys like Protestant ministers' wives. They might have maids but they answer doors themselves and say, One moment, please, and give you sixpence. I'd like to talk to them and ask them how it feels to be doomed but they might get offended and take back the sixpence.\nThe Irishmen working in England send their telegram money orders on Friday nights and all day Saturday and that's when we get the good tips. The minute we deliver one batch we're out with another.\nThe worst lanes are in the Irishtown, off High Street or Mungret Street, worse than Roden Lane or O'Keeffe's Lane or any lane I lived in. There are lanes with channels running down the middle. Mothers stand at doors and yell gardyloo when they empty their slop buckets. Children make paper boats or float matchboxes with little sails on the greasy water.\nWhen you ride into a lane the children call out, Here's the telegram boy, here's the telegram boy. They run to you and the women wait at the door. If you give a small child a telegram for his mother he's the hero of the family. Little girls know they're supposed to wait till the boys get their chance though they can get the telegram if they have no brothers. Women at the door will call to you that they have no money now but if you're in this lane tomorrow knock on the door for your tip, God bless you an' all belongin' to you.\nMrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry at the post office tell us every day our job is to deliver telegrams and nothing else. We are not to be doing things for people, going to the shop for groceries or any other kind of message. They don't care if people are dying in the bed. They don't care if people are legless, lunatic or crawling on the floor. We are to deliver the telegram and that's all. Mrs. O'Connell says, I know everything ye do, everything, for the people of Limerick have their eye on ye and there are reports which I have here in my drawers.\nA fine place to keep reports, says Toby Mackey under his breath.\nBut Mrs. O'Connell and Miss Barry don't know what it's like in the lane when you knock on a door and someone says come in and you go in and there's no light and there's a pile of rags on a bed in a corner the pile saying who is it and you say telegram and the pile of rags tells you would you ever go to the shop for me I'm starving with the hunger and I'd give me two eyes for a cup of tea and what are you going to do say I'm busy and ride off on your bike and leave the pile of rags there with a telegram money order that's pure useless because the pile of rags is helpless to get out of the bed to go to the post office to cash the bloody money order.\nWhat are you supposed to do?\nYou're told never never go to the post office to cash one of those money orders for anyone or you'll lose your job forever. But what are you supposed to do when an old man that was in the Boer War hundreds of years ago says his legs are gone and he'd be forever grateful if you'd go to Paddy Considine in the post office and tell him the situation and Paddy will surely cash the money order and keep two shillings for yourself grand boy that you are. Paddy Considine says no bother but don't tell anyone or I'd be out on my arse and so would you, son. The old man from the Boer War says he knows you have telegrams to deliver now but would you ever come back tonight and maybe go to the shop for him for he doesn't have a thing in the house and he's freezing on top of it. He sits in an old armchair in the corner covered with bits of blankets and a bucket behind the chair that stinks enough to make you sick and when you look at that old man in the dark corner you want to get a hose with hot water and strip him and wash him down and give him a big feed of rashers and eggs and mashed potatoes with loads of butter salt and onions.\nI want to take the man from the Boer War and the pile of rags in the bed and put them in a big sunny house in the country with birds chirping away outside the window and a stream gurgling.\nMrs. Spillane in Pump Lane off Carey's Road has two crippled twin children with big blond heads, small bodies, and bits of legs that dangle\nover the edges of the chairs. They look into the fire all day and say, Where's Daddy? They speak English like everybody else but they babble away to one another in a language they made up, Hung sup tea tea sup hung. Mrs. Spillane says that means, When are we getting our supper? She tells me she's lucky if her husband sends four pounds a month and she's beside herself with the abuse she gets from the Dispensary over him being in England. The children are only four and they're very bright even if they can't walk or take care of themselves. If they could walk, if they were any way normal, she'd pack up and move to England out of this godforsaken country that fought so long for freedom and look at the state of us, De Valera in his mansion above in Dublin the dirty oul' bastard and the rest of the politicians that can all go to hell, God forgive me. The priests can go to hell too and I won't ask God to forgive me for saying the likes of that. There they are, the priests and the nuns telling us Jesus was poor and 'tis no shame, lorries driving up to their houses with crates and barrels of whiskey and wine, eggs galore and legs of ham and they telling us what we should give up for Lent. Lent, my arse. What are we to give up when we have Lent all year long?\nI want to take Mrs. Spillane and her two blond crippled children and put them in that house in the country with the pile of rags and the man from the Boer War and wash everyone and let them all sit in the sun with the birds singing and the streams gurgling.\nI can't leave the pile of rags alone with a useless money order because the pile is an old woman, Mrs. Gertrude Daly, all twisted with every class of disease you can get in a Limerick lane, arthritis, rheumatism, falling hair, a nostril half gone from her jabbing at it with her finger, and you wonder what kind of a world is it when this old woman sits up from the rags and smiles at you with teeth that gleam white in the dark, her own teeth and perfect.\nThat's right, she says, me own teeth, and when I rot in the grave they'll find me teeth a hundred years from now all white an' shiny an' I'll be declared a saint.\nThe telegram money order, three pounds, is from her son. It has a message, Happy Birthday, Mammy, Your fond son, Teddy. She says, A wonder he can spare it, the little shit, trottin' around with every tart in Piccadilly. She asks if I'd ever do her a favor and cash the money order and get her a little Baby Powers whiskey at the pub, a loaf of bread, a pound of lard, seven potatoes, one for each day of the week. Would I boil\na potato for\nbread, bring\nO'Connor the\nsome soap so\ngrateful and\nmy troubles.\nher, mash it up with a lump of lard, give her a cut of\nher a drop of water to go with the whiskey? Would I go to chemist for ointment for her sores and while I'm at it bring she can give her body a good scrub and she'll be forever\nsay a prayer for me and here's a couple of shillings for all\nAh, no thanks, ma'am.\nTake the money. Little tip. You did me great favors.\nI couldn't, ma'am, the way you are.\nTake the money or I'll tell the post office you're not to deliver\nmy telegram anymore.\nOh, all right, ma'am. Thanks very much.\nGood night, son. Be good to your mother.\nGood night, Mrs. Daly.\nSchool starts in September and some days Michael stops at The\nAbbot's before the walk home to Laman Griffin's. On rainy days he says,\nCan I stay here tonight? and soon he doesn't want to go back to Laman Griffin's at all. He's worn out and hungry with two miles out and two miles back.\nWhen Mam comes looking for him I don't know what to say to her. I don't know how to look at her and I keep my eyes off to one side. She says, How's the job? as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's and I say, Grand, as if nothing ever happened in Laman Griffin's. If the rain is too heavy for her to go home she stays in the small room upstairs with Alphie. She goes back to Laman's the next day but Michael stays and soon she's moving in herself bit by bit till she stops going to Laman's altogether.\nThe Abbot pays the rent every week. Mam gets the relief and the food dockets till someone informs on her and she's cut off from the Dispensary. She's told that if her son is bringing in a pound a week that's more than some families get on the dole and she should be grateful he has a job. Now I have to hand over my wages. Mam says, A pound? Is that all you get for riding around in all kinds of weather? This would be four dollars in America. Four dollars. And you couldn't feed a cat for four dollars in New York. If you were delivering telegrams for Western Union in New York you'd be earning twenty-five dollars a week and living in luxury. She always translates Irish money into American so that she won't forget and tries to convince everyone times were better over there. Some weeks she lets me keep two shillings but if I go to a film or buy a secondhand book there's nothing left, I won't be able to save for my fare, and I'll be stuck in Limerick till I'm an old man of twenty-five.\nMalachy writes from Dublin to say he's fed up and doesn't want to spend the rest of his life blowing a trumpet in the army band. He's home in a week and complains when he has to share the big bed with Michael, Alphie and me. He had his own army cot up there in Dublin with sheets and blankets and a pillow. Now he's back to overcoats and a bolster that sends up a cloud of feathers when you touch it. Mam says, Pity about you. I'm sorry for your troubles. The Abbot has his own bed, and my mother has the small room. We're all together again, no Laman tormenting us. We make tea and fried bread and sit on the kitchen floor. The Abbot says you're not supposed to be sitting on kitchen floors, what are tables and chairs for? He tells Mam that Frankie is not right in the head and Mam says we'll all catch our death from the damp of the floor. We sit on the floor and sing and Mam and The Abbot sit on chairs. She sings \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" and the Abbot sings \"The Road to Rasheen\" and we still don't know what his song is about. We sit on the floor and tell stories about things that happened, things that never happened and things that will happen when we all go to America.\nThere are slow days at the post office and we sit on the bench and talk. We can talk but we are not to laugh. Miss Barry says we should be grateful we're getting paid to sit there, bunch of idlers and streetboys that we are, and that there is to be no laughing. Getting paid for sitting and chatting is no laughing matter and the first titter out of any of us and out we go till we come to our senses and if the tittering continues we'll be reported to the proper authorities.\nThe boys talk about her under their breath. Toby Mackey says, What that oul' bitch needs is a good rub o' the relic, a good rub o' the brush. Her mother was a streetwalking flaghopper and her father escaped from a lunatic asylum with bunions on his balls and warts on his wank.\nThere is laughing along the bench and Miss Barry calls to us, I warned ye against the laughing. Mackey, what is it you're prattling about over there?\nI said we'd all be better off out in the fresh air on this fine day delivering telegrams, Miss Barry.\nI'm sure you did, Mackey. Your mouth is a lavatory. Did you hear\nme?\nI did, Miss Barry.\nYou have been heard on the stairs, Mackey. Yes, Miss Barry.\nShut up, Mackey.\nI will, Miss Barry.\nNot another word, Mackey.\nNo, Miss Barry.\nI said shut up, Mackey.\nAll right, Miss Barry.\nThat's the end of it, Mackey. Don't try me. I won't, Miss Barry.\nMother o' God give me patience.\nYes, Miss Barry.\nTake the last word, Mackey. Take it, take it, take it.\nI will, Miss Barry.\nToby Mackey is a temporary telegram boy like me. He saw a film\ncalled The Front Page and now he wants to go to America some day and be a tough newspaper reporter with a hat and a cigarette. He keeps a notebook in his pocket because a good reporter has to write down what happens. Facts. He has to write down facts not a lot of bloody poetry, which is all you hear in Limerick with men in pubs going on about our great sufferings under the English. Facts, Frankie. He writes down the number of telegrams he delivers and how far he travels. We sit on the bench making sure we don't laugh and he tells me that if we deliver forty telegrams a day that's two hundred a week and that's ten thousand a year and twenty thousand in our two years at the job. If we cycle one hundred and twenty-five miles in a week that's thirteen thousand miles in two years and that's halfway around the world, Frankie, and no wonder there isn't a scrap of flesh on our arses.\nToby says nobody knows Limerick like the telegram boy. We know every avenue, road, street, terrace, mews, place, close, lane. Jasus, says Toby, there isn't a door in Limerick we don't know. We knock on all kinds of doors, iron, oak, plywood. Twenty thousand doors, Frankie. We rap, kick, push. We ring and buzz bells. We shout and whistle, Telegram boy, telegram boy. We drop telegrams in letter boxes, shove them under doors, throw them over the transom. We climb in windows where people are bedridden. We fight off every dog who wants to turn us into dinner. You never know what's going to happen when you hand people their telegrams. They laugh and sing and dance and cry and scream and fall down in a weakness and you wonder if they'll wake up at all and give you the tip. It's not a bit like delivering telegrams in America where Mickey Rooney rides around in a film called The Human Comedy and people are pleasant and falling over themselves to give you a tip, inviting you in, giving you a cup of tea and a bun.\nToby Mackey says he has facts galore in his notebook and he doesn't give a fiddler's fart about anything and that's the way I'd like to be myself.\nMrs. O'Connell knows I like the country telegrams and if a day is sunny she gives me a batch of ten that will keep me away all morning and I don't have to return till after the dinner hour at noon. There are fine autumn days when the Shannon sparkles and the fields are green and glinting with silver morning dew. Smoke blows across fields and there's the sweet smell of turf fires. Cows and sheep graze in the fields and I wonder if these are the beasts the priest was talking about. I wouldn't be surprised because there's no end to the bulls climbing on cows, rams on sheep, stallions on mares, and they all have such big things it makes me break out in a sweat to look at them and I feel sorry for all the female creatures in the world who have to suffer like that though I wouldn't mind being a bull myself because they can do what they like and it's never a sin for an animal. I wouldn't mind going at myself here but you never know when a farmer might come along the road driving cows and sheep to a fair or to another field raising his stick and bidding you, Good day, young fella, grand morning, thank God and His Blessed Mother. A farmer that religious might be offended if he saw you breaking the Sixth Commandment forninst his field. Horses like to stick their heads over fences and hedges to see what's passing by and I stop and talk to them because they have big eyes and long noses that show how intelligent they are. Sometimes two birds will be singing to each other across a field and I have to stop and listen to them and if I stay long enough more birds will join till every tree and bush is alive with birdsong. If there's a stream gurgling under a bridge on the road, birds singing and cows mooing and lambs baaing, that's better than any band in a film. The smell of dinner bacon and cabbage wafting from a farmhouse makes me so weak with the hunger I climb into a field and stuff myself with blackberries for half an hour. I stick my face into the stream and drink icy water that's better than the lemonade in any fish and chip shop.\nWhen I'm finished delivering the telegrams there's enough time to go to the ancient monastery graveyard where my mother's relations are buried, the Guilfoyles and the Sheehans, where my mother wants to be buried. I can see from here the high ruins of Carrigogunnell Castle and there's plenty of time to cycle there, sit up on the highest wall, look at the Shannon flowing out to the Atlantic on its way to America and dream of the day I'll be sailing off myself.\nThe boys at the post office tell me I'm lucky to get the Carmody family telegram, a shilling tip, one of the biggest tips you'll ever get in Limerick. So why am I getting it? I'm the junior boy. They say, Well, sometimes Theresa Carmody answers the door. She has the consumption and they're afraid of catching it from her. She's seventeen, in and out of the sanatorium, and she'll never see eighteen. The boys at the post office say sick people like Theresa know there's little time left and that makes them mad for love and romance and everything. Everything. That's what the consumption does to you, say the boys at the post office.\nI cycle through wet November streets thinking of that shilling tip, and as I turn into the Carmody street the bicycle slides out from under me and I skid along the ground scraping my face and tearing open the back of my hand. Theresa Carmody opens the door. She has red hair. She had green eyes like the fields beyond Limerick. Her cheeks are bright pink and her skin is a fierce white. She says, Oh, you're all wet and bleeding.\nI skidded on my bike.\nCome in and I'll put something on your cuts.\nI wonder, Should I go in? I might get the consumption and that will be the end of me. I want to be alive when I'm fifteen and I want the shilling tip. Come in. You'll perish standing there.\nShe puts on the kettle for the tea. Then she dabs iodine on my cuts and I try to be a man and not whimper. She says, Oh, you're a great bit of a man. Go into the parlor and dry yourself before the fire. Look, why don't you take off your pants and dry them on the screen of the fire?\nAh, no.\nAh, do.\nI will.\nI drape my pants over the screen. I sit there watching the steam\nrise and I watch myself rise and I worry she might come in and see me in my excitement.\nThere she is with a plate of bread and jam and two cups of tea. Lord, she says, you might be a scrawny bit of a fellow but that's a fine boyo you have there.\nShe puts the plate and the cups on a table by the fire and there they stay. With her thumb and forefinger she takes the tip of my excitement and leads me across the room to a green sofa against the wall and all the time my head is filled with sin and iodine and fear of consumption and the shilling tip and her green eyes and she's on the sofa don't stop or I'll die and she's crying and I'm crying for I don't know what's happening to me if I'm killing myself catching consumption from her mouth I'm riding to heaven I'm falling off a cliff and if this is a sin I don't give a fiddler's fart.\nWe take our ease on the sofa a while till she says, Don't you have more telegrams to deliver? and when we sit up she gives a little cry, Oh, I'm bleeding.\nWhat's up with you?\nI think it's because it's the first time.\nI tell her, Wait a minute. I bring the bottle from the kitchen and\nsplash the iodine on her injury. She leaps from the sofa, dances around the parlor like a wild one and runs into the kitchen to douse herself with water. After she dries herself she says, Lord, you're very innocent. You're not supposed to be pouring iodine on girls like that.\nI thought you were cut.\nFor weeks after that I deliver the telegram. Sometimes we have the excitement on the sofa but there are other days she has the cough and you can see the weakness on her. She never tells me she has the weakness. She never tells me she has the consumption. The boys at the post office say I must have been having a great time with the shilling tip and Theresa Carmody. I never tell them I stopped taking the shilling tip. I never tell them about the green sofa and the excitement. I never tell them of the pain that comes when she opens the door and I can see the weakness on her and all I want to do then is make tea for her and sit with my arms around her on the green sofa.\nOne Saturday I'm told to deliver the telegram to Theresa's mother at her job in Woolworth's. I try to be casual. Mrs. Carmody, I always deliver the telegram to your, I think your daughter, Theresa?\nYes, she's in the hospital.\nIs she in the sanatorium?\nI said she's in the hospital.\nShe's like everyone else in Limerick, ashamed of the TB, and she\ndoesn't give me a shilling or any kind of tip. I cycle out to the\nsanatorium to see Theresa. They say you have to be a relation and you have to be adult. I tell them I'm her cousin and I'll be fifteen in August. They tell me go away. I cycle to the Franciscan church to pray for Theresa. St. Francis, would you please talk to God. Tell Him it wasn't Theresa's fault. I could have refused that telegram Saturday after Saturday. Tell God Theresa was not responsible for the excitement on the sofa because that's what the consumption does to you. It doesn't matter anyway, St. Francis, because I love Theresa. I love her as much as you love any bird or beast or fish and will you tell God take the consumption away and I promise I'll never go near her again.\nThe next Saturday they give me the Carmody telegram. From halfway up the street I can see the blinds are drawn. I can see the black crepe wreath on the door. I can see the white purple-lined mourning card. I can see beyond the door and walls where Theresa and I tumbled naked and wild on the green sofa and I know now she is in hell and all because of me.\nI slip the telegram under the door and cycle back down to the Franciscan church to beg for the repose of Theresa's soul. I pray to every statue, to the stained glass windows, the Stations of the Cross. I swear I'll lead a life of faith, hope and charity, poverty, chastity and obedience.\nNext day, Sunday, I go to four Masses. I do the Stations of the Cross three times. I say rosaries all day. I go without food and drink and wherever I find a quiet place I cry and beg God and the Virgin Mary to have mercy on the soul of Theresa Carmody.\nOn Monday I follow the funeral to the graveyard on my post office bicycle. I stand behind a tree a distance from the grave. Mrs. Carmody weeps and moans. Mr. Carmody snuffles and looks puzzled. The priest recites the Latin prayers and sprinkles the coffin with holy water.\nI want to go to the priest, to Mr. and Mrs. Carmody. I want to tell them how I'm the one who sent Theresa to hell. They can do whatever they like with me. Abuse me. Revile me. Throw grave dirt at me. But I stay behind the tree till the mourners leave and the grave diggers fill in the grave.\nFrost is already whitening the fresh earth on the grave and I think of Theresa cold in the coffin, the red hair, the green eyes. I can't understand the feelings going through me but I know that with all the people who died in my family and all the people who died in the lanes around me and all the people who left I never had a pain like this in my heart and I hope I never will again.\nIt's getting dark. I walk my bicycle out of the graveyard. I have telegrams to deliver.\nXVI\nMrs. O'Connell gives me telegrams to deliver to Mr. Harrington, the Englishman with the dead wife that was born and bred in Limerick. The boys at the post office say sympathy telegrams are a waste of time. People just cry and moan with the grief and they think they're excused from the tip. They'll ask you if you'd like to come in for a look at the departed and a prayer by the bed. That wouldn't be so bad if they offered you a drop of sherry and a ham sandwich. Oh, no, they're happy to get your prayer but you're only a telegram boy and you're lucky if you get a\ndry biscuit. Older boys at the post office say you have to play your cards right to get the grief tip. If you're asked in to say a prayer you have to kneel by the corpse, give a powerful sigh, bless yourself, drop your forehead to the bedclothes so they won't see your face, let your shoulders shake like one collapsing with sorrow, hold on to the bed with your two hands as if they're going to have to tear you away to deliver the rest of your telegrams, make sure your cheeks are glinting with tears or the spit you dabbed on, and if you don't get a tip after all that push the next batch of telegrams under the door or fire them over the transom and leave them to their grief.\nThis isn't my first time delivering telegrams to the Harrington house. Mr. Harrington is always away on business for the insurance company and Mrs. Harrington is generous with the tip. But she's gone and Mr. Harrington answers the doorbell. His eyes are red and he sniffles. He says, Are you Irish?\nIrish? What else would I be standing there on his doorstep in Limerick with a batch of telegrams in my hand? I am, sir. He says, Come in. Put the telegrams on the hall stand. He shuts the hall door, locks it, puts the key in his pocket and I think, Aren't Englishmen very peculiar.\nYou'll want to see her, of course. You'll want to see what you people have done to her with your damn tuberculosis. Race of ghouls. Follow me.\nHe leads me first to the kitchen where he picks up a plate of ham sandwiches and two bottles, and then upstairs. Mrs. Harrington looks lovely in the bed, blond, pink, peaceful.\nThis is my wife. She may be Irish but she doesn't look it, thank God. Like you. Irish. You'll need a drink, of course. You Irish quaff at every turn. Barely weaned before you clamor for the whiskey bottle, the pint of stout. You'll have what, whiskey, sherry?\nAh, a lemonade will be lovely.\nI am mourning my wife not celebrating the bloody citrus. You'll have a sherry. Swill from bloody Catholic fascist Spain.\nI gulp the sherry. He refills my glass and goes to refill his own with whiskey. Damn. Whiskey all gone. Stay here. Do you hear me? I'm going to the pub for another bottle of whiskey. Stay till I come back. Don't move.\nI'm confused, dizzy from the sherry. I don't know what you're supposed to do with grieving Englishmen. Mrs. Harrington, you look lovely in the bed. But you're a Protestant, already doomed, in hell, like Theresa. Priest said, Outside the Church there is no salvation. Wait, I might be able to save your soul. Baptize you Catholic. Make up for what I did to Theresa. I'll get some water. Oh, God, the door is locked. Why? Maybe you're not dead at all? Watching me. Are you dead, Mrs. Harrington? I'm not afraid. Your face is icy. Oh, you're dead all right. I'll baptize you with sherry from bloody Catholic fascist Spain. I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Son, the- What the bloody hell are you doing? Get off my wife, you wretched Papist twit. What primitive Paddy ritual is this? Did you touch her? Did you? I'll wring your scrawny neck.\nI - I, -\nOi, Oi, speak English, you scrap.\nI was just, a little sherry to get her into heaven.\nHeaven? We had heaven, Ann, I, our daughter, Emily. You'll never lay your pink piggy eyes on her. Oh, Christ, I can't stand it. Here, more sherry.\nAh, no, thanks.\nAh, no thanks. That puny Celtic whine. You people love your alcohol. Helps you crawl and whine better. Of course you want food. You have the collapsed look of a starving Paddy. Here. Ham. Eat.\nAh, no thanks.\nAh, no thanks. Say that again and I'll ram the ham up your arse. He waves a ham sandwich at me, with the heel of his hand pushes it\ninto my mouth.\nHe collapses into a chair. Oh, God, God, what am I to do? Must rest\na moment.\nMy stomach heaves. I rush to the window, stick my head out and\nthrow up. He leaps from the chair and charges me.\nYou, you, God blast you to hell, you vomited on my wife's rosebush. He lunges at me, misses, falls to the floor. I climb out the\nwindow, hang on to the ledge. He's at the window, grabbing at my hands. I let go, drop to the rosebush, into the ham sandwich and sherry I've just thrown up. I'm pricked by rose thorns, stung, my ankle is twisted. He's at the window, barking, Come back here, you Irish runt. He'll report me to the post office. He hits me in the back with the whiskey bottle, pleads, Will you not watch one hour with me?\nHe pelts me with sherry glasses, whiskey glasses, assorted ham sandwiches, items from his wife's dressing table, powders, creams, brushes.\nI climb on my bike and wobble through the streets of Limerick, dizzy with sherry and pain. Mrs. O'Connell attacks me, Seven telegrams, one address, and you're gone all day.\nI was, I was,\nYou was. You was. Drunk is what you was. Drunk is what you are. Reeking. Oh, we heard. That nice man rang, Mr. Harrington, lovely Englishman that sounds like James Mason. Lets you in to say a prayer for his poor wife and next thing you're out the window with the sherry and the ham. Your poor mother. What she brought into the world.\nHe made me eat the ham, drink the sherry.\nMade you? Jesus, that's a good one. Made you. Mr. Harrington is a refined Englishman and there is no reason for him to lie and we don't want your kind in this post office, people that can't keep their hands off the ham and sherry, so hand in your telegram pouch and bicycle for your days are done in this post office.\nBut I need the job. I have to save and go to America.\nAmerica. Sad day when America lets in the likes of you.\nI hobble through the streets of Limerick. I'd like to go back and\nthrow a brick through Mr. Harrington's window. No. Respect for the dead. I'll go across the Sarsfield Bridge and out the riverbank where I can lie down somewhere in the bushes. I don't know how I can go home and tell my mother I lost my job. Have to go home. Have to tell her. Can't stay out the riverbank all night. She'd be frantic.\nMam begs the post office to take me back. They say no. They never heard the likes. Telegram boy mauling corpse. Telegram boy fleeing scene with ham and sherry. He will never set foot in the post office again. No.\nShe gets a letter from the parish priest. Take the boy back, says the parish priest. Oh, yes, Father, indeed, says the post office. They'll\nlet me stay till my sixteenth birthday, not a minute longer. Besides, says Mrs. O'Connell, when you think of what the English did to us for eight hundred years that man had no right to complain over a little ham and sherry. Compare a little ham and sherry to the Great Famine and where are you? If my poor husband was alive and I told him what you did he'd say you struck a blow, Frank McCourt, struck a blow.\nEvery Saturday morning I swear I'll go to confession and tell the priest of my impure acts at home, on lonely boreens around Limerick with cows and sheep gawking, on the heights of Carrigogunnell with the world looking up.\nI'll tell him about Theresa Carmody and how I sent her to hell, and that will be the end of me, driven from the Church.\nTheresa is a torment to me. Every time I deliver a telegram to her street, every time I pass the graveyard I feel the sin growing in me like an abscess and if I don't go to confession soon I'll be nothing but an abscess riding around on a bicycle with people pointing and telling each other, There he is, there's Frankie McCourt, the dirty thing that sent Theresa Carmody to hell.\nI look at people going to Communion on Sundays, everyone in a state of grace, returning to their seats with God in their mouths, peaceful, easy, ready to die at any moment and go straight to heaven or go home to their rashers and eggs without a worry in the world.\nI'm worn out from being the worst sinner in Limerick. I want to get rid of this sin and have rashers and eggs and no guilt, no torment. I want to be ordinary.\nThe priests tell us all the time that God's mercy is infinite but how can any priest give absolution to someone like me who delivers telegrams and winds up in a state of excitement on a green sofa with a girl dying of the galloping consumption.\nI cycle all around Limerick with telegrams and stop at every church. I ride from Redemptorists to Jesuits to Augustinians to Dominicans to Franciscans. I kneel before the statue of St. Francis of Assisi and beg him to help me but I think he's too disgusted with me. I kneel with people in the pews next to confessionals but when my turn comes I can't breathe, my heart pounds, my forehead turns cold and clammy and I run from the church.\nI swear I'll go to confession at Christmas. I can't. Easter. I can't. Weeks and months pass and it's a year since Theresa died. I'll go on her anniversary but I can't. I'm fifteen now and I pass churches without stopping. I'll have to wait till I go to America where there are priests like Bing Crosby in Going My Way who won't kick me out of the confessional like Limerick priests.\nI still have the sin in me, the abscess, and I hope it doesn't kill me entirely before I see the American priest.\nThere's a telegram for an old woman, Mrs. Brigid Finucane. She says, How old are you, by?\nFifteen and a half, Mrs. Finucane.\nYoung enough to make a fool of yourself and ould enough to know better. Are you shmart, by? Are you anyway intelligent?\nI can read and write, Mrs. Finucane.\nArrah, there are people above in the lunatic asylum can read and write. Can you write a letter?\nI can.\nShe wants me to write letters to her customers. If you need a suit or dress for your child you can go to her. She gives you a ticket to a shop and they give you the clothes. She gets a discount and charges you the full price and interest on top. You pay her back weekly. Some of her customers fall behind in their payments and they need threatening letters. She says, I'll give you threepence for every letter you write and another threepence if it brings a payment. If you want the job come here on Thursday and Friday nights, and bring your own paper and envelopes.\nI'm desperate for that job. I want to go to America. But I have no money for paper and envelopes. Next day I'm delivering a telegram to Woolworth's and there is the answer, a whole section packed with paper and envelopes. I have no money so I have to help myself. But how? Two dogs save the day for me, two dogs at the door of Woolworth's stuck together after the excitement. They yelp and run in circles. Customers and sales clerks giggle and pretend to be looking someplace else and while they're busy pretending I slip paper and envelopes under my sweater, out the door and off on my bike far from stuck dogs.\nMrs. Finucane looks suspicious. That's very fancy stationery you have there, by. Is that your mother's? You'll give that back when you get the money, won't you, by?\nOh, I will.\nFrom now on I'm never to come to her front door. There's a lane behind her house and I'm to come in the back door for fear someone might see me.\nIn a large ledger she gives me the names and addresses of six customers behind in their payments. Threaten 'em, by. Frighten the life out of 'em.\nMy first letter,\nDear Mrs. O'Brien,\nInasmuch as you have not seen fit to pay me what you owe me I may be forced to resort to legal action. There's your son, Michael, parading around the world in his new suit which I paid for while I myself have barely a crust to keep body and soul together. I am sure you don't want to languish in the dungeons of Limerick jail far from friends and family.\nI remain, yours in litigious anticipation, Mrs. Brigid Finucane She tells me, That's a powerful letter, by, better than anything you'd read in the Limerick Leader. That word, inasmuch, that's a holy terror of a word. What does it mean?\nI think it means this is your last chance.\nI write five more letters and she gives me money for stamps. On my way to the post office I think, Why should I squander money on stamps when I have two legs to deliver the letters myself in the dead of night? When you're poor a threatening letter is a threatening letter no matter how it comes in the door.\nI run through the lanes of Limerick shoving letters under doors, praying no one will see me.\nThe next week Mrs. Finucane is squealing with joy. Four of 'em paid. Oh, sit down now and write more, by. Put the fear of God in 'em.\nWeek after week my threatening letters grow sharper and sharper. I begin to throw in words I hardly understand myself.\nDear Mrs. O'Brien,\nInasmuch as you have not succumbed to the imminence of litigation in our previous epistle be advised that we are in consultation with our barrister above in Dublin.\nNext week Mrs. O'Brien pays. She came in tremblin' with tears in her eyes, by, and she promised she'd never miss another payment.\nOn Friday nights Mrs. Finucane sends me to a pub for a bottle of sherry. You're too young for sherry, by. You can make yourself a nice cup of tea but you have to use the tea leaves left over from this morning. No, you can't have a piece of bread with the prices they're charging. Bread is it? Next thing you'll be asking for an egg.\nShe rocks by the fire, sipping her sherry, counting the money in the purse on her lap, entering payments in her ledger before she locks everything in the trunk under her bed upstairs. After a few sherries she tells me what a lovely thing it is to have a little money so you can leave it to the Church for Masses to be said for the repose of your soul. It makes her so happy to think of priests saying Masses for her years and years after she's dead and buried.\nSometimes she falls asleep and if the purse drops to the floor I help myself to an extra few shillings for the overtime and the use of all the big new words. There will be less money for the priests and their Masses but how many Masses does a soul need and surely I'm entitled to a few pounds after the way the Church slammed doors in my face? They wouldn't let me be an altar boy, a secondary school pupil, a missionary with the White Fathers. I don't care. I have a post office savings account and if I keep writing successful threatening letters, helping myself to the odd few shillings from her purse and keeping the stamp money, I'll have my escape money to America. If my whole family dropped from the hunger I wouldn't touch this money in the post office.\nOften I have to write threatening letters to neighbors and friends of my mother and I worry they might discover me. They complain to Mam, That oul' bitch, Finucane, below in Irishtown, sent me a threatening letter. What kind of a demon outa hell would torment her own kind with a class of a letter that I can't make head nor tail of anyway with words never heard on land or sea. The person that would write that letter is worse than Judas or any informer for the English.\nMy mother says anyone that writes such letters should be boiled in oil and have his fingernails pulled out by blind people.\nI'm sorry for their troubles but there's no other way for me to save the money for America. I know that someday I'll be a rich Yank and send home hundreds of dollars and my family will never have to worry about threatening letters again.\n***\nSome of the temporary telegram boys are taking the permanent exam in August. Mrs. O'Connell says, You should take that exam, Frank McCourt. You have a bit of a brain in your head and you'd pass it no bother. You'd be a postman in no time and a great help to your poor mother.\nMam says I should take it, too, become a postman, save up, go to America and be a postman over there and wouldn't that be a lovely life.\nI'm delivering a telegram to South's pub on a Saturday and Uncle Pa Keating is sitting there, all black as usual. He says, Have a lemonade there, Frankie, or is it a pint you want now that you're near sixteen?\nLemonade, Uncle Pa, thanks.\nYou'll want your first pint the day you're sixteen, won't you? I will but my father won't be here to get it for me.\nDon't worry about that. I know 'tis not the same without your\nfather but I'll get you the first pint. 'Tis what I'd do if I had a son. Come here the night before you're sixteen.\nI will, Uncle Pa.\nI hear you're taking that exam for the post office?\nI am.\nWhy would you do a thing like that? 'Tis a good job and I'd be a\npostman in no time and it has the pension.\nAh, pension my arse. Sixteen years of age an' talking about the\npension. Is it coddin' me you are? Do you hear what I said, Frankie? Pension my arse. If you pass the exam you'll stay in the post office nice and secure the rest of your life. You'll marry a Brigid and have five little Catholics and grow little roses in your garden. You'll be dead in your head before you're thirty and dried in your ballocks the year before. Make up your own bloody mind and to hell with the safeshots and the begrudgers. Do you hear me, Frankie McCourt?\nI do, Uncle Pa. That's what Mr. O'Halloran said.\nWhat did he say?\nMake up your own mind.\nTrue for Mr. O'Halloran. 'Tis your life, make your own decisions\nand to hell with the begrudgers, Frankie. In the heel o' the hunt you'll be going to America anyway, won't you?\nI will, Uncle Pa.\nThe day of the exam I'm excused from work. There's a sign in an office window on O'Connell Street, SMART BOY WANTED, NEAT HANDWRITING, GOOD AT SUMS, APPLY HERE TO MANAGER, MR. MCCAFFREY, EASONS LTD.\nI stand outside the place of the exam, the house of the Limerick Protestant Young Men's Association. There are boys from all over Limerick climbing the steps to take the exam and a man at the door is handing them sheets of paper and pencils and barking at them to hurry up, hurry up. I look at the man at the door, I think of Uncle Pa Keating and what he said, I think of the sign in Easons' office, SMART BOY WANTED. I don't want to go in that door and pass that exam for if I do I'll be a permanent telegram boy with a uniform, then a postman, then a clerk selling stamps for the rest of my life. I'll be in Limerick forever, growing roses with my head dead and my ballocks all dried up.\nThe man at the door says, You, are you coming in here or are you goin' to stand there with your face hanging out?\nI want to say to the man, Kiss my arse, but I still have a few weeks left in the post office and he might report me. I shake my head and walk up the street where a smart boy is wanted.\nThe manager, Mr. McCaffrey, says, I would like to see a specimen of your handwriting, to see, in short, if you have a decent fist. Sit down there at that table. Write your name and address and write me a paragraph explaining why you came here for this job and how you propose to rise in the ranks of Eason and Son, Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assiduity where there is great opportunity in this company for a boy that will keep his eye on the guidon ahead and guard his flanks from the siren call of sin.\nI write,\nFrank McCourt,\n4 Little Barrington Street,\nLimerick City,\nCounty Limerick,\nIreland\nI am applying for this job so that I can rise to the highest ranks of Easons Ltd., by dint of perseverance and assadooty knowing that if I keep my eyes ahead and protect my flanks I'll be safe from all temptation and a credit to Easons and Ireland in general.\nWhat's this? says Mr. McCaffrey. Do we have here a twisting of the truth?\nI don't know, Mr. McCaffrey.\nLittle Barrington Street. That's a lane. Why are you calling it a street? You live in a lane, not a street.\nThey call it a street, Mr. McCaffrey.\nDon't be getting above yourself, boy.\nOh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey.\nYou live in a lane and that means you have nowhere to go but up. Do\nyou understand that, McCourt?\nI do, sir.\nYou have to work your way out of the lane, McCourt. I do, Mr. McCaffrey.\nYou have the cut and jib of a lane boy, McCourt. Yes, Mr. McCaffrey.\nYou have the look of the lane all over you. All over you from poll to toe cap. Don't try to fool the populace, McCourt. You'd have to rise early in the morning to fool the likes of me.\nOh, I wouldn't, Mr. McCaffrey.\nThen there's the eyes. Very sore eyes you have there. Can you see? I can, Mr. McCaffrey.\nYou can read and write but can you do addition and subtraction?\nI can, Mr. McCaffrey.\nWell, I don't know what the policy is on sore eyes. I would have to\nring Dublin and see where they stand on sore eyes. But your writing is clear, McCourt. A good fist. We'll take you on pending the decision on the sore eyes. Monday morning. Half six at the railway station.\nIn the morning? In the morning. We don't give out the bloody morning papers at night, do we?\nNo, Mr. McCaffrey.\nAnother thing. We distribute The Irish Times, a Protestant paper, run by the freemasons in Dublin. We pick it up at the railway station. We count it. We take it to the newsagents. But we don't read it. I don't want to see you reading it. You could lose the Faith and by the look of those eyes you could lose your sight. Do you hear me, McCourt?\nI do, Mr. McCaffrey.\nNo IrishTimes, and when you come in next week I'll tell you about all the English filth you're not to read in this office. Do you hear me?\nI do, Mr. McCaffrey.\nMrs. O'Connell has the tight mouth and she won't look at me. She says to Miss Barry, I hear a certain upstart from the lanes walked away from the post office exam. Too good for it, I suppose.\nTrue for you, says Miss Barry.\nToo good for us, I suppose.\nTrue for you.\nDo you think he'd ever tell us why he didn't take the exam?\nOh, he might, says Miss Barry, if we went down on our two knees. I tell her, I want to go to America, Mrs. O'Connell.\nDid you hear that, Miss Barry?\nI did, indeed, Mrs. O'Connell.\nHe spoke.\nHe did, indeed.\nHe will rue the day, Miss Barry.\nRue he will, Mrs. O'Connell.\nMrs. O'Connell talks past me to the boys waiting on the bench for\ntheir telegrams, This is Frankie McCourt who thinks he's too good for the post office.\nI don't think that, Mrs. O'Connell.\nAnd who asked you to open your gob, Mr. High and Mighty? Too grand for us, isn't he, boys?\nHe is, Mrs. O'Connell.\nAnd after all we did for him, giving him the telegrams with the good tips, sending him to the country on fine days, taking him back after his disgraceful behavior with Mr. Harrington, the Englishman, disrespecting the body of poor Mrs. Harrington, stuffing himself with ham sandwiches, getting fluthered drunk on sherry, jumping out the window and destroying every rosebush in sight, coming in here three sheets to the wind, and who knows what else he did delivering telegrams for two years, who knows indeed, though we have a good idea, don't we, Miss Barry?\nWe do, Mrs. O'Connell, though 'twouldn't be a fit subject to be talking about.\nShe whispers to Miss Barry and they look at me and shake their heads.\nA disgrace he is to Ireland and his poor mother. I hope she never finds out. But what would you expect of one born in America and his father from the North. We put up with all that and still took him back.\nShe keeps talking past me again to the boys on the bench.\nGoing to work for Easons he is, working for that pack of freemasons and Protestants above in Dublin. Too good for the post office but ready and willing to deliver all kinds of filthy English magazines all over Limerick. Every magazine he touches will be a mortal sin. But he's leaving now, so he is, and a sorry day it is for his poor mother that prayed for a son with a pension to take care of her in her latter days. So here, take your wages and go from the sight of us.\nMiss Barry says, He's a bad boy, isn't he, boys?\nHe is, Miss Barry.\nI don't know what to say. I don't know what I did wrong. Should I\nsay I'm sorry? Good-bye?\nI lay my belt and pouch on Mrs. O'Connell's desk. She glares at me,\nGo on. Go to your job at Easons. Go from us. Next boy, come up for your telegrams.\nThey're back at work and I'm down the stairs to the next part of my life.\nXVII\nI don't know why Mrs. O'Connell had to shame me before the whole world, and I don't think I'm too good for the post office or anything else. How could I with my hair sticking up, pimples dotting my face, my eyes red and oozing yellow, my teeth crumbling with the rot, no shoulders, no flesh on my arse after cycling thirteen thousand miles to deliver twenty thousand telegrams to every door in Limerick and regions beyond?\nMrs. O'Connell said a long time ago she knew everything about every telegram boy. She must know about the times I went at myself on top of Carrigogunnell, milkmaids gawking, little boys looking up.\nShe must know about Theresa Carmody and the green sofa, how I got her into a state of sin and sent her to hell, the worst sin of all, worse than Carrigogunnell a thousand times. She must know I never went to confession after Theresa, that I'm doomed to hell myself.\nA person that commits a sin like that is never too good for the post office or anything else.\nThe barman at South's remembers me from the time I sat with Mr. Hannon, Bill Galvin, Uncle Pa Keating, black white black. He remembers my father, how he spent his wages and his dole while singing patriotic songs and making speeches from the dock like a condemned rebel.\nAnd what is it you'd like? says the barman.\nI'm here to meet Uncle Pa Keating and have my first pint.\nOh, begod, is that a fact? He'll be here in a minute and sure\nthere's no reason why I shouldn't draw his pint and maybe draw your first pint, is there now?\nThere isn't, sir.\nUncle Pa comes in and tells me sit next to him against the wall. The barman brings the pints, Uncle Pa pays, lifts his glass, tells the men in the pub, This is my nephew, Frankie McCourt, son of Angela Sheehan, the sister of my wife, having his first pint, here's to your health and long life, Frankie, may you live to enjoy the pint but not too much.\nThe men lift their pints, nod, drink, and there are creamy lines on their lips and mustaches. I take a great gulp of my pint and Uncle Pa tells me, Slow down for the love o' Jasus, don't drink it all, there's more where that came from as long as the Guinness family stays strong and healthy.\nI tell him I want to stand him a pint with my last wages from the post office but he says, No, take the money home to your mother and you can stand me a pint when you come home from America flushed with success and the heat from a blonde hanging on your arm.\nThe men in the pub are talking about the terrible state of the world and how in God's name Hermann Goering escaped the hangman an hour before the hanging. The Yanks are over there in Nuremberg declaring they don't know how the Nazi bastard hid that pill. Was it in his ear? Up his nostril? Up his arse? Surely the Yanks looked in every hole and cranny of every Nazi they captured and still Hermann wiped their eye. There you are. It shows you can sail across the Atlantic, land in Normandy, bomb Germany off the face of the earth, but when all's said and done they can't find a little pill planted in the far reaches of Goering's fat arse.\nUncle Pa buys me another pint. It's harder to drink because it fills me and makes my belly bulge. The men are talking about\nconcentration camps and the poor Jews that never harmed a soul, men, women, children crammed into ovens, children, mind you, what harm could they do, little shoes scattered everywhere, crammed in, and the pub is misty and the voices fading in and out. Uncle Pa says, Are you all right? You're as white as a sheet. He takes me to the lavatory and the two of us have a good long piss against the wall which keeps moving back and forth. I can't go into the pub again, cigarette smoke, stale Guinness, Goering's fat arse, small shoes scattered, can't go in again, good night, Uncle Pa, thanks, and he tells me go straight home to my mother, straight home, oh, he doesn't know about the excitement in the loft or the excitement on the green sofa or me in such a state of doom that if I died now I'd be in hell in a wink.\nUncle Pa goes back to his pint. I'm out on O'Connell Street and why shouldn't I take the few steps to the Jesuits and tell all my sins this last night I'll be fifteen. I ring the bell at the priests'house and a big man answers, Yes? I tell him, I want to go to confession, Father. He says, I'm not a priest. Don't call me father. I'm a brother.\nAll right, Brother. I want to go to confession before I'm sixteen tomorrow. State o' grace on my birthday.\nHe says, Go away. You're drunk. Child like you drunk as a lord ringing for a priest at this hour. Go away or I'll call the guards.\nAh, don't. Ah, don't. I only want to go to confession. I'm doomed. You're drunk and you're not in a proper spirit of repentance.\nHe closes the door in my face. Another door closed in the face, but\nI'm sixteen tomorrow and I ring again. The brother opens the door, swings me around, kicks my arse and sends me tripping down the steps.\nHe says, Ring this bell again and I'll break your hand.\nJesuit brothers are not supposed to talk like that. They're supposed to be like Our Lord, not walking the world threatening people's hands.\nI'm dizzy. I'll go home to bed. I hold on to railings along Barrington Street and keep to the wall going down the lane. Mam is by the fire smoking a Woodbine, my brothers upstairs in the bed. She says, That's a nice state to come home in.\nIt's hard to talk but I tell her I had my first pint with Uncle Pa. No father to get me the first pint.\nYour Uncle Pa should know better.\nI stagger to a chair and she says, Just like your father. I try to control the way my tongue moves in my mouth. I'd rather be, I'd rather, rather be like my father than Laman Griffin.\nShe turns away from me and looks into the ashes in the range but I won't leave her alone because I had my pint, two pints, and I'm sixteen tomorrow, a man.\nDid you hear me? I'd rather be like my father than Laman Griffin. She stands up and faces me. Mind your tongue, she says.\nMind your own bloody tongue.\nDon't talk to me like that. I'm your mother.\nI'll talk to you any bloody way I like.\nYou have a mouth like a messenger boy.\nDo I? Do I? Well, I'd rather be a messenger boy than the likes of\nLaman Griffin oul' drunkard with the snotty nose and his loft and people climbing up there with him.\nShe walks away from me and I follow her upstairs to the small room. She turns, Leave me alone, leave me alone, and I keep barking at her,\nLaman Griffin, Laman Griffin, till she pushes me, Get out of this room, and I slap her on the cheek so that tears jump in her eyes and there's a small whimpering sound from her, You'll never have the chance to do that again, and I back away from her because there's another sin on my long list and I'm ashamed of myself.\nI fall into my bed, clothes and all, and wake up in the middle of the night puking on my pillow, my brothers complaining of the stink, telling me clean up, I'm a disgrace. I hear my mother crying and I want to tell her I'm sorry but why should I after what she did with Laman Griffin.\nIn the morning my small brothers are gone to school, Malachy is out looking for a job, Mam is at the fire drinking tea. I place my wages on the table by her elbow and turn to go. She says, Do you want a cup of tea?\nNo.\n'Tis your birthday.\nI don't care.\nShe calls up the lane after me, You should have something in your\nstomach, but I give her my back and turn the corner without answering. I still want to tell her I'm sorry but if I do I'll want to tell her she's the cause of it all, that she should not have climbed to the loft that night and I don't give a fiddler's fart anyway because I'm still writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane and saving to go to America.\nI have the whole day before I go to Mrs. Finucane to write the threatening letters and I wander down Henry Street till the rain drives me into the Franciscan church where St. Francis stands with his birds and lambs. I look at him and wonder why I ever prayed to him. No, I didn't pray, I begged.\nI begged him to intercede for Theresa Carmody but he never did a thing, stood up there on his pedestal with the little smile, the birds, the lambs, and didn't give a fiddler's fart about Theresa or me.\nI'm finished with you, St. Francis. Moving on. Francis. I don't know why they ever gave me that name. I'd be better off if they called me Malachy, one a king, the other a great saint. Why didn't you heal Theresa? Why did you let her go to hell? You let my mother climb to the loft. You let me get into a state of doom. Little children's shoes scattered in concentration camps. I have the abscess again. It's in my chest and I'm hungry.\nSt. Francis is no help, he won't stop the tears bursting out of my two eyes, the sniffling and choking and the God oh Gods that have me on my knees with my head on the back of the pew before me and I'm so weak with the hunger and the crying I could fall on the floor and would you please help me God or St. Francis because I'm sixteen today and I hit my mother and sent Theresa to hell and wanked all over Limerick and the county beyond and I dread the millstone around my neck.\nThere is an arm around my shoulders, a brown robe, click of black rosary beads, a Franciscan priest.\nMy child, my child, my child.\nI'm a child and I lean against him, little Frankie on his father's lap, tell me all about Cuchulain, Dad, my story that Malachy can't have or Freddie Leibowitz on the swings.\nMy child, sit here with me. Tell me what troubles you. Only if you want to. I am Father Gregory.\nI'm sixteen today, Father.\nOh, lovely, lovely, and why should that be a trouble to you?\nI drank my first pint last night.\nYes? I hit my mother.\nGod help us, my child. But He will forgive you. Is there anything\nelse?\nI can't tell you, Father.\nWould you like to go to confession?\nI can't, Father. I did terrible things.\nGod forgives all who repent. He sent His only Beloved Son to die\nfor us.\nI can't tell, Father. I can't.\nBut you could tell St. Francis, couldn't you?\nHe doesn't help me anymore.\nBut you love him, don't you?\nI do. My name is Francis.\nThen tell him. We'll sit here and you'll tell him the things that\ntrouble you. If I sit and listen it will only be a pair of ears for St. Francis and Our Lord. Won't that help?\nI talk to St. Francis and tell him about Margaret, Oliver, Eugene, my father singing Roddy McCorley and bringing home no money, my father sending no money from England, Theresa and the green sofa, my terrible sins on Carrigogunnell, why couldn't they hang Hermann Goering for what he did to the little children with shoes scattered around concentration camps, the Christian Brother who closed the door in my face, the time they wouldn't let me be an altar boy, my small brother Michael walking up the lane with the broken shoe clacking, my bad eyes that I'm ashamed of, the Jesuit brother who closed the door in my face, the tears in Mam's eyes when I slapped her.\nFather Gregory says, Would you like to sit and be silent, perhaps pray a few minutes?\nHis brown robe is rough against my cheek and there's a smell of soap. He looks at St. Francis and the tabernacle and nods and I suppose he's talking to God. Then he tells me kneel, gives me absolution, tells me say three Hail Marys, three Our Fathers, three Glory Bes. He tells me God forgives me and I must forgive myself, that God loves me and I must love myself for only when you love God in yourself can you love all God's creatures.\nBut I want to know about Theresa Carmody in hell, Father.\nNo, my child. She is surely in heaven. She suffered like the martyrs in olden times and God knows that's penance enough. You can be sure the sisters in the hospital didn't let her die without a priest.\nAre you sure, Father?\nI am, my child.\nHe blesses me again, asks me to pray for him, and I'm happy\ntrotting through the rainy streets of Limerick knowing Theresa is in heaven with the cough gone.\nMonday morning and it's dawn in the railway station. Newspapers and magazines are piled in bundles along the platform wall. Mr. McCaffrey is there with another boy, Willie Harold, cutting the twine on the bundles, counting, entering the count in a ledger. English newspapers and The Irish Times have to be delivered early, magazines later in the morning. We count out the papers and label them for delivery to shops around the city.\nMr. McCaffrey drives the van and stays at the wheel while Willie and I run into shops with bundles and take orders for the next day, add or drop in the ledger. After the papers are delivered we unload the magazines at the office and go home to breakfast for fifty minutes.\nWhen I return to the office there are two other boys, Eamon and Peter, already sorting magazines, counting and stuffing them into news agents' boxes along the wall. Small orders are delivered by Gerry Halvey on his messenger bicycle, big orders in the van. Mr. McCaffrey tells me stay in the office so that I can learn to count magazines and enter them in the ledger. The minute Mr. McCaffrey leaves Eamon and Peter pull out a drawer where they hide cigarette butts and light up. They can't believe I don't smoke. They want to know if there's something wrong with me, the bad eyes or the consumption maybe. How can you go out with a girl if you don't smoke? Peter says, Wouldn't you be a right eejit if you were going out the road with the girl and she asked you for a fag and you said you didn't smoke, wouldn't you be a right eejit then? How would you ever get her into a field for a bit of a feel? Eamon says, 'Tis what my father says about men who don't drink, they're not to be trusted. Peter says if you find a man that won't drink or smoke that's a man that's not even interested in girls and you'd want to keep your hand over the hole of your arse, that's what you'd want to be doing.\nThey laugh and that brings on the cough and the more they laugh the more they cough till they're holding on to one another banging one another between the shoulder blades and wiping tears from their cheeks. When the fit passes we pick out English and American magazines and look at the advertisements for women's underwear, brassieres and panties and long nylon stockings. Eamon is looking at an American magazine called See with pictures of Japanese girls who keep the soldiers happy so far away from home and Eamon says he has to go to the lavatory and when he does Peter gives me a wink, You know what he's up to in there, don't you? and sometimes Mr. McCaffrey gets into a state when boys linger in the lavatory interfering with themselves and wasting the valuable time for which Easons is paying them and on top of it putting their immortal souls in danger. Mr. McCaffrey won't come right out and say, Stop that wanking, because you can't accuse someone of a mortal sin unless you have proof. Sometimes he goes snooping in the lavatory when a boy comes out. He comes back himself with the threatening look and tells the boys, Ye are not to be looking at those dirty magazines from foreign parts. Ye are to count them and put them in the boxes and that's all.\nEamon comes back from the lavatory and Peter goes in with an American magazine, Collier's, that has pictures of girls in a beauty contest. Eamon says, Do you know what he's doing in there? At himself. Five times a day he goes in. Every time a new American magazine comes in with the women's underwear he goes in. Never done going at himself. Borrows magazines to take home unbeknownst to Mr. McCaffrey and God knows what he does with himself and the magazines all night. If he fell dead in there the jaws of hell would open wide.\nI'd like to get into the lavatory myself when Peter comes out but I don't want them saying, There he goes, new boy, first day on the job, already at himself. Won't light up a fag oh no but wanks away like an oul' billygoat.\nMr. McCaffrey returns from van delivery and wants to know why all the magazines aren't counted out, bundled and ready to go. Peter tells him, We were busy teaching the new boy, McCourt. God help us, he was a\nbit slow with the bad eyes you know but we kept at him and now he's getting faster.\nGerry Halvey, the messenger boy, won't be in for a week because he's entitled to his holidays and he wants to spend the time with his girlfriend, Rose, who's coming back from England. I'm the new boy and I have to be messenger boy while he's gone, cycling around Limerick on the bicycle with the big metal basket in front. He shows me how to balance papers and magazines so that the bicycle won't tip over with me in the saddle and a lorry passing by that will run over me and leave me like a piece of salmon in the road. He saw a soldier once that was run over by an army lorry and that's what he looked like, salmon.\nGerry is making a last delivery at Easons kiosk at the railway station at noon on Saturday and that's handy because I can meet him there to get the bicycle and he can meet Rose off the train. We stand at the gate waiting and he tells me he hasn't seen Rose in a year. She's over there working in a pub in Bristol and he doesn't like that one bit because the English are forever pawing the Irish girls, hands up under the skirts and worse, and the Irish girls are afraid to say anything for fear of losing their jobs. Everyone knows Irish girls keep themselves pure especially Limerick girls known the world over for their purity who have a man to come back to like Gerry Halvey himself. He'll be able to tell if she was true to him by her walk. If a girl comes back after a year with a certain class of a walk that's different from the one she went away with then you know she was up to no good with the Englishmen dirty horny bastards that they are.\nThe train hoots into the station and Gerry waves and points to Rose coming toward us from the far end of the train, Rose smiling away with her white teeth and lovely in a green dress. Gerry stops waving and mutters under his breath, Look at the walk on her, bitch, hoor, street walker, flaghopper, trollop, and runs from the station. Rose walks up to me, Was that Gerry Halvey you were standing with?\n'Twas.\nWhere is he?\nOh, he went out.\nI know he went out. Where did he go?\nI don't know. He didn't tell me. He just ran out.\nDidn't say anything?\nI didn't hear him say anything.\nDo you work with him?\nI do. I'm taking over the bike.\nWhat bike?\nThe messenger bike.\nIs he on a messenger bike?\nHe is.\nHe told me he worked in Easons office, clerk, inside job?\nI feel desperate. I don't want to make a liar of Gerry Halvey, to\nget him into trouble with the lovely Rose. Oh, we all take turns on the messenger bike. An hour in the office, an hour on the bike. The manager says 'tis good to get out in the fresh air.\nWell, I'll just go home and put my suitcase down and go to his house. I thought he'd carry this for me.\nI have the bike here and you can stick the case in the basket and I'll walk you home.\nWe walk up to her house in Carey's Road and she tells me she's so excited about Gerry. She saved her money in England and now she wants to go back with him and get married even if he's only nineteen and she's only seventeen. What matter when you're in love. I lived like a nun in England and dreamt of him every night and thank you very much for carrying my case.\nI turn away to jump on the bike and cycle back to Easons when Gerry comes at me from behind. His face is red and he's snorting like a bull. What were you doing with my girl, you little shite? Eh? What? If 'tis a thing I ever find out you did anything with my girl I'll kill you.\nI didn't do anything. Carried her case because 'twas heavy. Don't look at her again or you're dead.\nI won't, Gerry. I don't want to look at her.\nOh, is that a fact? Is she ugly or what?\nNo, no, Gerry, she's yours and she loves you. How do you know?\nShe told me.\nShe did?\nShe did, honest to God.\nJasus.\nHe bangs on her door, Rose, Rose, are you there? and she comes out,\nOf course, I'm here, and I ride away on the messenger bicycle with the sign on the basket that says Easons wondering about the way he's kissing her now and the terrible things he said about her in the station and wondering how Peter in the office could tell Mr. McCaffrey a barefaced lie about me and my eyes when all the time he and Eamon were looking at girls in their underwear and then going at themselves in the lavatory.\nMr. McCaffrey is in a terrible state in the office. Where were you? Great God above in heaven, does it take you all day to cycle from the railway station? We have an emergency here and we should have Halvey but he's gone off on his friggin' holidays, God forgive the language, and you'll have to cycle around as fast as you can, good thing you were a telegram boy that knows every inch of Limerick, and go to every bloody shop that's a customer and walk right in grab whatever copies you see of John O'London's Weekly tear out page sixteen and if anyone bothers you tell them 'tis government orders and they're not to interfere in government business and if they lay a finger on you they're liable to arrest, imprisonment and a large fine now go for God's sake and bring back every page sixteen you tear out so that we can burn them here in the fire.\nEvery shop, Mr. McCaffrey?\nI'll do the big ones, you do the small ones all the way to Ballinacurra and out the Ennis Road and beyond, God help us. Go on, go.\nI'm jumping on the bike and Eamon runs down the steps. Hey, McCourt, wait. Listen. Don't give him all the page sixteens when you come back.\nWhy?\nWe can sell 'em, me an' Peter.\nWhy?\n'Tis all about birth control and that's banned in Ireland.\nWhat's birth control?\nAw, Christ above, don't you know anything? 'Tis condoms, you know,\nrubbers, French letters, things like that to stop the girls from getting up the pole.\nUp the pole?\nPregnant. Sixteen years of age an' you're pure ignorant. Hurry up an' get the pages before everybody starts runnin' to the shop for John O'London's Weekly.\nI'm about to push away on the bike when Mr. McCaffrey runs down the steps. Hold on, McCourt, we'll go in the van. Eamon, you come with us.\nWhat about Peter?\nLeave him. He'll wind up with a magazine in the lavatory anyway. Mr. McCaffrey talks to himself in the van. Nice bloody how do you\ndo ringing down here from Dublin on a fine Saturday to send us tearing around Limerick ripping pages out of an English magazine when I could be at home with a cup of tea and a nice bun and a read of The Irish Press with my feet up on a box under the picture of the Sacred Heart nice bloody how do you do entirely.\nMr. McCaffrey runs into every shop with us behind him. He grabs the magazines, hands each of us a pile and tells us start tearing. Shop owners scream at him, What are ye doing? Jesus, Mary and Holy St. Joseph, is it pure mad ye are? Put back them magazines or I'll call the guards.\nMr. McCaffrey tells them, Government orders, ma'am. There is filth in John O'London this week that's not fit for any Irish eyes and we are here to do God's work. What filth?\nWhat filth? Show me the filth before ye go mutilatin' the magazines. I won't pay Easons for these magazines, so I won't.\nMa'am, we don't care at Easons. We'd rather lose large amounts than have the people of Limerick and Ireland corrupted by this filth.\nWhat filth?\nCan't tell you. Come on, boys.\nWe throw the pages on the floor of the van and when Mr. McCaffrey\nis in a shop arguing we stuff some into our shirts. There are old magazines in the van and we tear and scatter them so that Mr. McCaffrey will think they're all page sixteen from John O'London.\nThe biggest customer for the magazine, Mr. Hutchinson, tells Mr. McCaffrey get to hell out of his shop or he'll brain him, get away from them magazines, and when Mr. McCaffrey keeps on tearing out pages Mr. Hutchinson throws him into the street, Mr. McCaffrey yelling that this is a Catholic country and just because Hutchinson is a Protestant that doesn't give him the right to sell filth in the holiest city in Ireland. Mr. Hutchinson says, Ah, kiss my arse, and Mr. McCaffrey says, See, boys? See what happens when you're not a member of the True Church?\nSome shops says they've already sold all their copies of John O'London and Mr. McCaffrey says, Oh, Mother o'God, what's going to become of us all? Who did ye sell them to?\nHe demands the names and address of the customers who are in danger of losing their immortal souls from reading articles on birth control. He will go to their houses and rip out that filthy page but the shopkeepers say, 'Tis Saturday night, McCaffrey, and getting dark and would you ever take a good running jump for yourself.\nOn the way back to the office Eamon whispers to me in the back of the van, I have twenty-one pages. How many do you have? I tell him fourteen but I have over forty and I'm not telling him because you never have to tell the truth to people who lie about your bad eyes. Mr. McCaffrey tells us bring in the pages from the van. We scoop up everything on the floor and he's happy sitting at his desk at the other end of the office ringing Dublin to tell them how he stormed through\nshops like God's avenger and saved Limerick from the horrors of birth control while he watches a dancing fire of pages that have nothing to do with John O'London's Weekly.\nMonday morning I cycle through the streets delivering magazines and people see the Easons sign on the bike and stop me to see if there's any chance they could get their hands on a copy of John O'London's Weekly. They're all rich looking people, some in motor cars, men with hats, collars and ties, and two fountain pens in their pockets, women with hats and little bits of fur dangling from their shoulders, people who have tea at the Savoy or the Stella and stick out their little fingers to show how well bred they are and now want to read this page about birth control.\nEamon told me early in the day, Don't sell the bloody page for less than five shillings. I asked him if he was joking. No, he wasn't. Everyone in Limerick is talking about this page and they're dying to get their hands on it.\nFive shillings or nothing, Frankie. If they're rich charge more but that's what I'm charging so don't be going around on your bicycle and puttin' me out of business with low prices. We have to give Peter something or he'll be running to McCaffrey and spilling the beans.\nSome people are willing to pay seven shillings and sixpence and I'm rich in two days with over ten pounds in my pocket minus one for Peter the snake, who would betray us to McCaffrey. I put eight pounds in the post office for my fare to America and that night we have a big supper of ham, tomatoes, bread, butter, jam. Mam wants to know if I won the sweepstakes and I tell her people give me tips. She's not happy I'm a messenger boy because that's the lowest you can drop in Limerick but if it brings in ham like this we should light a candle in gratitude. She doesn't know the money for my fare is growing in the post office and she'd die if she knew what I was earning from writing threatening letters.\nMalachy has a new job in the stockroom of a garage handing out parts to mechanics and Mam herself is taking care of an old man, Mr. Sliney, out in the South Circular Road while his two daughters go off to work every day. She tells me if I'm delivering papers out there to come to the house for tea and a sandwich. The daughters will never know and the old man won't mind because he's only half conscious most of the time worn out from all his years in the English army in India.\nShe looks peaceful in the kitchen of this house in her spotless apron, everything clean and polished around her, flowers bobbing in the garden beyond, birds chirping away, music from Radio Eireann on the wireless. She sits at the table with a pot of tea, cups and saucers, plenty of bread, butter, cold meats of all kinds. I can have any class of a sandwich but all I know is ham and brawn. She doesn't have any brawn because that's the kind of thing you'd find people eating in lanes not in a house on the South Circular Road. She says the rich won't eat brawn because it's what they scoop off floors and counters in bacon factories and you never know what you're getting. The rich are very particular about what they stick between two slices of bread. Over in America brawn is called head cheese and she doesn't know why.\nShe gives me a ham sandwich with juicy slices of tomato and tea in a cup with little pink angels flying around shooting arrows at other little flying angels who are blue and I wonder why they can't make teacups and chamber pots without all kinds of angels and maidens cavorting in the glen. Mam says that's the way the rich are, they love\nthe bit of decoration and wouldn't we if we had the money. She'd give her two eyes to have a house like this with flowers and birds abroad in the garden and the wireless playing that lovely Warsaw Concerto or the Dream of Olwyn and no end of cups and saucers with angels shooting arrows.\nShe says she has to look in on Mr. Sliney he's so old and feeble he forgets to call for the chamber pot.\nChamber pot? You have to empty his chamber pot?\nOf course I do. There's a silence here because I think we're remembering the cause of all our troubles, Laman Griffin's chamber pot. But that was a long time ago and now it's Mr. Sliney's chamber pot, which is no harm because she's paid for this and he's harmless. When she comes back she tells me Mr. Sliney would like to see me, so come in while he's awake.\nHe's lying in a bed in the front parlor, the window blocked with a black sheet, no sign of light. He tells my mother, Lift me up a bit, missus, and pull back that bloody thing off the window so I can see the boy. He has long white hair down to his shoulders. Mam whispers he won't let anyone cut it. He says, I have me own teeth, son. Would you credit that? Do you have your own teeth, son?\nI do, Mr. Sliney.\nAh. I was in India you know. Me and Timoney up the road. Bunch of Limerick men in India. Do you know Timoney, son?\nI did, Mr. Sliney.\nHe's dead, you know. Poor bugger went blind. I have me sight. I have me teeth. Keep your teeth, son.\nI will, Mr. Sliney.\nI'm getting tired, son, but there's one thing I want to tell you. Are you listening to me?\nI am, Mr. Sliney.\nIs he listening to me, missus?\nOh, he is, Mr. Sliney.\nGood. Now here's what I want to tell you. Lean over here so I can\nwhisper in your ear. What I want to tell you is, Never smoke another man's pipe.\n***\nHalvey goes off to England with Rose and I have to stay on the messenger bike all through the winter. It's a bitter winter, ice everywhere, and I never know when the bike will go out from under me and send me flying into the street or onto the pavement, magazines and papers scattered. Shops complain to Mr. McCaffrey that The Irish Times is coming in decorated with bits of ice and dog shit and he mutters to us that's the way that paper should be delivered, Protestant rag that it is.\nEvery day after my deliveries I take The Irish Times home and read it to see where the danger is. Mam says it's a good thing Dad isn't here. He'd say, Is this what the men of Ireland fought and died for that my own son is sitting there at the kitchen table reading the freemason paper?\nThere are letters to the editor from people all over Ireland claiming they heard the first cuckoo of the year and you can read between the lines that people are calling each other liars. There are reports about Protestant weddings and pictures and the women always look lovelier than the ones we know in the lanes. You can see Protestant women have perfect teeth although Halvey's Rose had lovely teeth.\nI keep reading The Irish Times and wondering if it's an occasion of sin though I don't care. As long as Theresa Carmody is in heaven not\ncoughing I don't go to confession anymore. I read The Irish Times and TheTimes of London because that tells me what the King is up to every day and what Elizabeth and Margaret are doing.\nI read English women's magazines for all the food articles and the answers to women's questions. Peter and Eamon put on English accents and pretend they're reading from English women's magazines.\nPeter says, Dear Miss Hope, I'm going out with a fellow from Ireland named McCaffrey and he has his hands all over me and his thing pushing against my belly button and I'm demented not knowing what to do. I remain, yours anxiously, Miss Lulu Smith, Yorkshire.\nEamon says, Dear Lulu, If this McCaffrey is that tall that he's pushing his yoke against your belly button I suggest you find a smaller man who will slip it between your thighs. Surely you can find a decent short man in Yorkshire.\nDear Miss Hope, I am thirteen years old with black hair and something terrible is happening and I can't tell anyone not even my mother. I'm bleeding every few weeks you know where and I'm afraid I'll be found out. Miss Agnes Tripple, Little Biddle-on-the-Twiddle, Devon.\nDear Agnes, You are to be congratulated. You are now a woman and you can get your hair permed because you are having your monthlies. Do not fear your monthlies for all Englishwomen have them. They are a gift of God to purify us so that we can have stronger children for the empire, soldiers to keep the Irish in their place. In some parts of the world a woman with a monthly is unclean but we British cherish our women with the monthlies, oh we do indeed.\nIn the springtime there's a new messenger boy and I'm back in the office. Peter and Eamon drift off to England. Peter is fed up with Limerick, no girls, and you're driven to yourself, wank wank wank, that's all we ever do in Limerick. There are new boys. I'm senior boy and the job is easier because I'm fast and when Mr. McCaffrey is out in the van and my work is done I read the English, Irish, American magazines and papers. Day and night I dream of America.\nMalachy goes to England to work in a rich Catholic boys' boarding school and he walks around cheerful and smiling as if he's the equal of any boy in the school and everyone knows when you work in an English boarding school you're supposed to hang your head and shuffle like a proper Irish servant. They fire him for his ways and Malachy tells them they can kiss his royal Irish arse and they say that's the kind of foul language and behavior you'd expect. He gets a job in the gas works in Coventry shoveling coal into the furnaces like Uncle Pa Keating, shoveling coal and waiting for the day he can go to America after me.\nXVIII\nI'm seventeen, eighteen, going on nineteen, working away at Easons, writing threatening letters for Mrs. Finucane, who says she's not long for this world and the more Masses said for her soul the better she'll feel. She puts money in envelopes and sends me to churches around the city to knock on priests' doors, hand in the envelopes with the request for Masses. She wants prayers from all the priests but the Jesuits. She says, They're useless, all head and no heart. That's what they should\nhave over their door in Latin and I won't give them a penny because every penny you give a Jesuit goes to a fancy book or a bottle of wine.\nShe sends the money, she hopes the Masses are said, but she's never sure and if she's not sure why should I be handing out all that money to priests when I need the money to go to America and if I keep back a few pounds for myself and put it in the post office who will ever know the difference and if I say a prayer for Mrs. Finucane and light candles for her soul when she dies won't God listen even if I'm a sinner long past my last confession.\nI'll be nineteen in a month. All I need is a few pounds to make up the fare and a few pounds in my pocket when I land in America.\nThe Friday night before my nineteenth birthday Mrs. Finucane sends me for the sherry. When I return she is dead in the chair, her eyes wide open, and her purse on the floor wide open. I can't look at her but I help myself to a roll of money. Seventeen pounds. I take the key to the trunk upstairs. I take forty of the hundred pounds in the trunk and the ledger. I'll add this to what I have in the post office and I have enough to go to America. On my way out I take the sherry bottle to save it from being wasted.\nI sit by the River Shannon near the dry docks sipping Mrs. Finucane's sherry. Aunt Aggie's name is in the ledger. She owes nine pounds. It might have been the money she spent on my clothes a long time ago but now she'll never have to pay it because I heave the ledger into the river. I'm sorry I'll never be able to tell Aunt Aggie I saved her nine pounds. I'm sorry I wrote threatening letters to the poor people in the lanes of Limerick, my own people, but the ledger is gone, no one will ever know what they owe and they won't have to pay their balances. I wish I could tell them, I'm your Robin Hood.\nAnother sip of the sherry. I'll spare a pound or two for a Mass for Mrs. Finucane's soul. Her ledger is well on its way down the Shannon and out to the Atlantic and I know I'll follow it someday soon.\nThe man at O'Riordan's Travel Agency says he can't get me to America by air unless I travel to London first, which would cost a fortune. He can put me on a ship called the Irish Oak, which will be leaving Cork in a few weeks. He says, Nine days at sea, September October, best time of the year, your own cabin, thirteen passengers, best of food, bit of a holiday for yourself and that will cost fifty-five pounds, do you have it?\nI do.\nI tell Mam I'm going in a few weeks and she cries. Michael says, Will we all go some day?\nWe will.\nAlphie says, Will you send me a cowboy hat and a thing you throw that comes back to you?\nMichael tells him that's a boomerang and you'd have to go all the way to Australia to get the likes of that, you can't get it in America.\nAlphie says you can get it in America yes you can and they argue about America and Australia and boomerangs till Mam says, For the love o' Jesus, yeer brother is leaving us and the two of ye are there squabbling over boomerangs. Will ye give over?\nMam says we'll have to have a bit of party the night before I go. They used to have parties in the old days when anyone would go to America, which was so far away the parties were called American wakes because the family never expected to see the departing one again in this\nlife. She says 'tis a great pity Malachy can't come back from England but we'll be together in America someday with the help of God and His Blessed Mother.\nOn my days off from work I walk around Limerick and look at all the places we lived, the Windmill Street, Hartstonge Street, Roden Lane, Rosbrien Road, Little Barrington Street, which is really a lane. I stand looking at Theresa Carmody's house till her mother comes out and says, What do you want? I sit at the graves of Oliver and Eugene in the old St. Patrick's Burying Ground and cross the road to St. Lawrence's Cemetery where Theresa is buried. Wherever I go I hear voices of the dead and I wonder if they can follow you across the Atlantic Ocean.\nI want to get pictures of Limerick stuck in my head in case I never come back. I sit in St. Joseph's Church and the Redemptorist church and tell myself take a good look because I might never see this again. I walk down Henry Street to say good-bye to St. Francis though I'm sure I'll be able to talk to him in America.\nNow there are days I don't want to go to America. I'd like to go to O'Riordan's Travel Agency and get back my fifty-five pounds. I could wait till I'm twenty-one and Malachy can go with me so that I'll know at least one person in New York. I have strange feelings and sometimes when I'm sitting by the fire with Mam and my brothers I feel tears coming and I'm ashamed of myself for being weak. At first Mam laughs and tells me, Your bladder must be near your eye, but then Michael says, We'll all go to America, Dad will be there, Malachy will be there and we'll all be together, and she gets the tears herself and we sit there, the four of us, like weeping eejits.\nMam says this is the first time we ever had a party and isn't it a sad thing altogether that you have it when your children are slipping away one by one, Malachy to England, Frank to America. She saves a few shillings from her wages taking care of Mr. Sliney to buy bread, ham, brawn, cheese, lemonade and a few bottles of stout. Uncle Pa Keating brings stout, whiskey and a little sherry for Aunt Aggie's delicate stomach and she brings a cake loaded with currants and raisins she baked herself. The Abbot brings six bottles of stout and says, That's all right, Frankie, ye can all drink it as long as I have a bottle or two for meself to help me sing me song.\nHe sings \"The Road to Rasheen. \" He holds his stout, closes his eyes, and song comes out in a high whine. The words make no sense and everyone wonders why tears are seeping from his shut eyes. Alphie whispers to me, Why is he crying over a song that makes no sense?\nI don't know.\nThe Abbot ends his song, opens his eyes, wipes his cheeks and tells us that was a sad song about an Irish boy that went to America and got shot by gangsters and died before a priest could reach his side and he tells me don't be gettin' shot if you're not near a priest.\nUncle Pa says that's the saddest song he ever heard and is there any chance we could have something lively. He calls on Mam and she says, Ah, no, Pa, sure I don't have the wind.\nCome on, Angela, come on. One voice now, one voice and one voice\nonly.\nAll right. I'll try.\nWe all join in the chorus of her sad song,\nA mother's love is a blessing No matter where you roam. Keep her while you have her,\nYou'll miss her when she's gone.\nUncle Pa says one song is worse than the one before and are we turning this night into a wake altogether, is there any chance someone would sing a song to liven up the proceedings or will he be driven to drink with the sadness.\nOh, God, says Aunt Aggie, I forgot. The moon is having an eclipse abroad this minute.\nWe stand out in the lane watching the moon disappear behind a round black shadow. Uncle Pa says, That's a very good sign for you going to America, Frankie.\nNo, says Aunt Aggie, 'tis a bad sign. I read in the paper that the moon is practicing for the end of the world.\nOh, end of the world my arse, says Uncle Pa. 'Tis the beginning for Frankie McCourt. He'll come back in a few years with a new suit and fat on his bones like any Yank and a lovely girl with white teeth hangin' from his arm.\nMam says, Ah, no, Pa, ah, no, and they take her inside and comfort her with a drop of sherry from Spain.\nIt's late in the day when the Irish Oak sails from Cork, past Kinsale and Cape Clear, and dark when lights twinkle on Mizen Head, the last of Ireland I'll see for God knows how long.\nSurely I should have stayed, taken the post office examination, climbed in the world. I could have brought in enough money for Michael and Alphie to go to school with proper shoes and bellies well filled. We could have moved from the lane to a street or even an avenue where houses have gardens. I should have taken that examination and Mam would never again have to empty the chamber pots of Mr. Sliney or anyone else.\nIt's too late now. I'm on the ship and there goes Ireland into the night and it's foolish to be standing on this deck looking back and thinking of my family and Limerick and Malachy and my father in England and even more foolish that songs are going through my head Roddy McCorley goes to die and Mam gasping Oh the days of the Kerry dancing with poor Mr. Clohessy hacking away in the bed and now I want Ireland back at least I had Mam and my brothers and Aunt Aggie bad as she was and Uncle Pa, standing me my first pint, and my bladder is near my eye and here's a priest standing by me on the deck and you can see he's curious.\nHe's a Limerickman but he has an American accent from his years in Los Angeles. He knows how it is to leave Ireland, did it himself and never got over it. You live in Los Angeles with sun and palm trees day in day out and you ask God if there's any chance He could give you one soft rainy Limerick day.\nThe priest sits beside me at the table of the First Officer, who tells us ship's orders have been changed and instead of sailing to New York we're bound for Montreal.\nThree days out and orders are changed again. We are going to New York after all.\nThree American passengers complain, Goddam Irish. Can't they get it straight?\nThe day before we sail into New York orders are changed again. We are going to a place up the Hudson River called Albany.\nThe Americans say, Albany? Goddam Albany? Why the hell did we have to sail on a goddam Irish tub? Goddam.\nThe priest tells me pay no attention. All Americans are not like that.\nI'm on deck the dawn we sail into New York. I'm sure I'm in a film, that it will end and lights will come up in the Lyric Cinema. The priest wants to point out things but he doesn't have to. I can pick out the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the Brooklyn Bridge. There are thousands of cars speeding along the roads and the sun turns everything to gold. Rich Americans in top hats white ties and tails must be going home to bed with the gorgeous women with white teeth. The rest are going to work in warm comfortable offices and no one has a care in the world.\nThe Americans are arguing with the captain and a man who climbed aboard from a tugboat. Why can't we get off here? Why do we have to sail all the goddam way to goddam Albany?\nThe man says, Because you're passengers on the vessel and the captain is the captain and we have no procedures for taking you ashore.\nOh, yeah. Well, this is a free country and we're American citizens.\nIs that a fact? Well, you're on an Irish ship with an Irish captain and you'll do what he goddam tells you or swim ashore.\nHe climbs down the ladder, tugboat chugs away, and we sail up the Hudson past Manhattan, under the George Washington Bridge, past hundreds of Liberty ships that did their bit in the war, moored now and ready to rot.\nThe captain announces the tide will force us to drop anchor overnight opposite a place called, the priest spells it for me, Poughkeepsie. The priest says that's an Indian name and the Americans say goddam Poughkeepsie.\nAfter dark a small boat put-puts to the ship and an Irish voice calls up, Hello, there. Bejasus, I saw the Irish flag, so I did. Couldn't believe me two eyes. Hello, there.\nHe invites the First Officer to go ashore for a drink and bring a friend and, You, too, Father. Bring a friend.\nThe priest invites me and we climb down a ladder to the small boat with the First Officer and the Wireless Officer. The man in the boat says his name is Tim Boyle from Mayo God help us and we docked there at the right time because there's a bit of a party and we're all invited. He takes us to a house with a lawn, a fountain and three pink birds standing on one leg. There are five women in a room called a living room. The women have stiff hair, spotless frocks. They have glasses in their hands and they're friendly and smile with perfect teeth. One says, Come right in. Just in time for the pawty.\nPawty. That's the way they talk and I suppose I'll be talking like that in a few years.\nTim Boyle tells us the girls are having a bit of a time while their husbands are away overnight hunting deer, and one woman, Betty, says, Yeah. Buddies from the war. That war is over nearly five years and they can't get over it so they shoot animals every weekend and drink Rheingold till they can't see. Goddam war, excuse the language, Fawder.\nThe priest whispers to me, These are bad women. We won't stay here long.\nThe bad women say, Whatcha like to drink? We got everything. What's your name, honey?\nFrank McCourt.\nNice name. So you take a little drink. All the Irish take a little drink. You like a beer?\nYes, please. Gee, so polite. I like the Irish. My grandmother was half Irish so that makes me half, quarter? I dunno. My name is Frieda. So here's your beer, honey.\nThe priest sits at the end of a sofa which they call a couch and two women talk to him. Betty asks the First Officer if he'd like to see the house and he says, Oh, I would, because we don't have houses like this in Ireland. Another woman tells the Wireless Officer he should see what they have growing in the garden, you wouldn't believe the flowers. Frieda asks me if I'm okay and I tell her yes but would she mind telling me where the lavatory is.\nThe what?\nLavatory.\nOh, you mean the bathroom. Right this way, honey, down the hall. Thanks.\nShe pushes in the door, turns on the light, kisses my cheek and\nwhispers she'll be right outside if I need anything.\nI stand at the toilet bowl firing away and wonder what I'd need at\na time like this and if this is a common thing in America, women waiting outside while you take a splash.\nI finish, flush and go outside. She takes my hand and leads me into a bedroom, puts down her glass, locks the door, pushes me down on the bed. She's fumbling at my fly. Damn buttons. Don't you have zippers in Ireland? She pulls out my excitement climbs up on me slides up and down up and down Jesus I'm in heaven and there's a knock on the door the priest Frank are you in there Frieda putting her finger to her lips and her eyes rolling to heaven Frank are you in there Father would you ever take a good running jump for yourself and oh God oh Theresa do you see what's happening to me at long last I don't give a fiddler's fart if the Pope himself knocked on this door and the College of Cardinals gathered gawking at the windows oh God the whole inside of me is gone into her and she collapses on me and tells me I'm wonderful and would I ever consider settling in Poughkeepsie.\nFrieda tells the priest I had a bit of a dizziness after going to the bathroom, that's what happens when you travel and you're drinking a strange beer like Rheingold, which she believes they don't have in Ireland. I can see the priest doesn't believe her and I can't stop the way the heat is coming and going in my face. He already wrote down my mother's name and address and now I'm afraid he'll write and say your fine son spent his first night in America in a bedroom in Poughkeepsie romping with a woman whose husband was away shooting deer for a bit of relaxation after doing his bit for America in the war and isn't this a fine way to treat the men who fought for their country.\nThe First Officer and the Wireless Officer return from their tours of the house and the garden and they don't look at the priest. The women tell us we must be starving and they go into the kitchen. We sit in the living room saying nothing to each other and listening to the women whispering and laughing in the kitchen. The priest whispers to me again, Bad women, bad women, occasion of sin, and I don't know what to say to him.\nThe bad women bring out sandwiches and pour more beer and when we finish eating they put on Frank Sinatra records and ask if anyone would like to dance. No one says yes because you'd never get up and dance with bad women in the presence of a priest, so the women dance with each other and laugh as if they all had little secrets. Tim Boyle drinks whiskey and\nfalls asleep in a corner till Frieda wakes him and tells him take us back to the ship. When we're leaving Frieda leans toward me as if she might kiss my cheek but the priest says good night in a very sharp way and no one shakes hands. As we walk down the street to the river we hear the women laughing, tinkling and bright in the night air.\nWe climb the ladder and Tim calls to us from his little boat, Mind yourselves going up that ladder. Oh, boys, oh, boys, wasn't that a grand night? Good night, boys, and good night, Father.\nWe watch his little boat till it disappears into the dark of the Pough- keepsie riverbank. The priest says good night and goes below and the First Officer follows him.\nI stand on the deck with the Wireless Officer looking at the lights of America twinkling. He says, My God, that was a lovely night, Frank. Isn't this a great country altogether?\nXIX 'Tis.3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/6998156", "artist_names": "Genius", "full_title": "April 2022 Singles Release Calendar by\u00a0Genius", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.999x999x1.png", "id": 6998156, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 8723889, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1659262627, "path": "/Genius-april-2022-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Genius-april-2022-singles-release-calendar-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2022, "month": 4, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "April 2022", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Apr. 2022", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5c650f43c87bbc0b7c7956246c30ceaf.999x999x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 31608}, "title": "April 2022 Singles Release Calendar", "title_with_featured": "April 2022 Singles Release Calendar", "updated_by_human_at": 1659262627, "url": "https://genius.com/Genius-april-2022-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/204611", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/822a5f872a1fcfe377695dc0046c6bc6.900x176x1.jpg", "id": 204611, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0ca83e3130e1303a7f78ba351e3091cd.1000x1000x1.png", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Genius", "slug": "Genius", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Genius", "iq": 77869}, "artist": "Genius", "lyrics": "April 2022 Singles Release Calendar Lyrics**ATTENTION: Please DO NOT edit this page on the NEW song page**4/1\n5 Seconds of Summer - \"Take My Hand\"\n71 Digits & Flo Rida - \"Low\"\nA Boogie wit da Hoodie - \"Playa\" ft.

UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING\n\nEight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a\nbreakfast cafe.  They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE,\nMR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,\nand the big boss, JOE CABOT.  Most are finished eating and\nare enjoying coffee and conversation.  Joe flips through a\nsmall address book.  Mr. Pink is telling a long and\ninvolved story about Madonna.\n\nMR. PINK\n\"Like a Virgin\" is all about a\ngirl who digs a guy with a big\ndick.  The whole song is a\nmetaphor for big dicks.\n\nMR. BLUE\nNo it's not.  It's about a girl\nwho is very vulnerable and she's\nbeen fucked over a few times.\nThen she meets some guy who's\nreally sensitive--\nMR. PINK\n--Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay.\nTell that bullshit to the\ntourists.\n\nJOE\n(looking through his\naddress book)\nToby...who the fuck is Toby?\nToby...Toby...think...think...\nthink...\n\nMR. PINK\nIt's not about a nice girl who\nmeets a sensitive boy.  Now\ngranted that's what \"True Blue\" is\nabout, no argument about that.\n\nMR. ORANGE\nWhich one is \"True Blue?\"\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nYou don't remember \"True Blue?\"\nThat was a big ass hit for\nMadonna.  Shit, I don't even\nfollow this Tops In Pops shit, and\nI've at least heard of \"True\nBlue.\"\n\nMR. ORANGE\nLook, asshole, I didn't say I\nain't heard of it.  All I asked\nwas how does it go?  Excuse me\nfor not being the world's biggest\nMadonna fan.\n\nMR. BROWN\nI hate Madonna.\n\nMR. BLUE\nI like her early stuff.  You know,\n\"Lucky Star,\" \"Borderline\" - but\nonce she got into her \"Papa Don't\nPreach\" phase, I don't know, I\ntuned out.\n\nMR. PINK\nHey, fuck all that, I'm\nmaking a point here.  You're gonna\nmake me lose my train\nof thought.\n\nJOE\nOh fuck, Toby's that little china\ngirl.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat's that?\n\nJOE\nI found this old address book in a\njacket I ain't worn in a coon's\nage.  Toby what?  What the fuck\nwas her last name?\n\nMR. PINK\nWhere was I?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nYou said \"True Blue\" was about a\nnice girl who finds a sensitive\nfella.  But \"Like a Virgin\" was a\nmetaphor for big dicks.\n\nMR. PINK\nLet me tell ya what \"Like a\nVirgin\"'s about.  It's about some\ncooze who's a regular fuck\nmachine.\nI mean all the time, morning, day,\nnight, afternoon, dick, dick,\ndick, dick, dick,\ndick, dick, dick, dick, dick,\ndick.\n\nMR. BLUE\nHow many dicks was that?\n\nMR. WHITE\nA lot.\n\nMR. PINK\nThen one day she meets a John\nHolmes motherfucker, and it's\nlike, whoa baby.  This mother\nfucker's like Charles Bronson in\n\"The Great Escape.\"  He's diggin\ntunnels.  Now she's gettin this\nserious dick action, she's feelin\nsomething she ain't felt since\nforever.  Pain.\n\nJOE\nChew?  Toby Chew?  No.\n\nMR. PINK\nIt hurts.  It hurts her.  It\nshouldn't hurt.  Her pussy should\nbe Bubble-Yum by now.  But when\nthis cat fucks her, it hurts.  It\nhurts like the first time.  The\npain is reminding a fuck machine\nwhat is was like to be a virgin.\nHence, \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\nThe fellas crack up.\n\nJOE\nWong?\n\nMR. PINK\nFuck you, wrong.  I'm right!  What\nthe fuck do you know about it\nanyway?  You're still listening to\nJerry-fucking-Vale.\n\nJOE\nNot wrong, dumb ass, Wong!  You\nknow, like the Chinese name?\n\nMr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand.  They\nfight, but they're not really mad at each other.\n\nMR. WHITE\nGive me this fucking thing.\n\nJOE\nWhat the fuck do you think you're\ndoin?  Give me my book back!\n\nMR. WHITE\nI'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe,\nI'll give it back when we leave.\n\nJOE\nWhaddaya mean, give it to me when\nwe leave, give it back now.\n\nMR. WHITE\nFor the past fifteen minutes now,\nyou've just been droning on with\nnames.  \"Toby...Toby...Toby...\nToby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby\nChung...fuckin Charlie Chan.\"  I\ngot Madonna's big dick outta my\nright ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-\nknow-what, outta my left.\n\nJOE\nWhat do you care?\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhen you're annoying as hell, I\ncare a lot.\n\nJOE\nGive me my book.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou gonna put it away?\n\nJOE\nI'm gonna do whatever I wanna do\nwith it.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWell, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna\nhave to keep it.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nJoe, you want me to shoot him for\nyou?\n\nMR. WHITE\nShit, you shoot me in a dream, you\nbetter wake up and apologize.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nHave you guys been listening to K-\nBILLY's super sounds of the\nseventies weekend?\n\nMR. PINK\nYeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nCan you believe the songs they\nbeen playin?\n\nMR. PINK\nNo, I can't.  You know what I\nheard the other day?  \"Heartbeat -\nIt's Lovebeat,\" by little Tony\nDeFranco and the DeFranco Family.\nI haven't heard that since I was\nin fifth fuckin grade.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nWhen I was coming down here, I was\nplayin it.  And \"The Night the\nLights Went Out in Georgia\" came\non.  Now I ain't heard that song\nsince it was big, but when it was\nbig, I heard it a million-\ntrillion times.  I'm listening to\nit this morning, and this was the\nfirst time I ever realized that\nthe lady singing the song, was the\none who killed Andy.\n\nMR. BLUE\nYou didn't know Vicki Lawrence\nkilled the guy?\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nI thought the cheatin wife shot\nAndy.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nThey say it in the song.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nI know, I heard it.  I musta zoned\nout whenever that part came on\nbefore.  I thought when she said\nthat little sister stuff, she was\ntalkin about her sister- in-law,\nthe cheatin wife.\n\nJOE\nNo, she did it.  She killed the\ncheatin wife, too.\n\nMR. PINK\nYou know the part in \"Gypsies,\nTramps and Theives,\" when she says\n\"Poppa woulda shot his if he knew\nwhat he'd done?\"  I could never\nfigure out what he did.\n\nThe table laughs.  The WAITRESS comes over to the table.\nShe has the check, and a pot of coffee.\n\nWAITRESS\nCan I get anybody more\ncoffee.\n\nJOE\nNo, we're gonna be hittin it.\nI'll take care of the check.\n\nShe hands the bill to him.\n\nWAITRESS\nHere ya go.  Please pay at the\nregister, if you wouldn't mind.\n\nJOE\nSure thing.\n\nWAITRESS\nYou guys have a wonderful day.\n\nThey all mutter equivalents.  She exits and Joe stands up.\n\nJOE\nI'll take care of this, you guys\nleave the tip.\n(to Mr. White)\nAnd when I come back, I want my\nbook back.\n\nMR. WHITE\nSorry, it's my book now.\n\nJOE\nBlonde, shoot this piece of shit,\nwill ya?\n\nMr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger.  Mr White\nacts shot.  Joe exits.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nOkay, everybody cough up green for\nthe little lady.\n\nEverybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table.\nEverybody, that is, except Mr. White.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nC'mon, throw in a buck.\n\nMR. WHITE\nUh-uh.  I don't tip.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nWhaddaya mean you don't tip?\n\nMR. WHITE\nI don't believe in it.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nYou don't believe in tipping?\n\nMR. PINK\n(laughing)\nI love this kid, he's a madman,\nthis guy.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nDo you have any idea what these\nladies make?  They make shit.\n\nMR. WHITE\nDon't give me that.  She don't\nmake enough money, she can quit.\n\nEverybody laughs.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nI don't even know a Jew who'd have\nthe balls to say that.  So let's\nget this straight. You never ever\ntip?\n\nMR. WHITE\nI don't tip because society says I\ngotta.  I tip when somebody\ndeserves a tip.  When somebody\nreally puts forth an effort, they\ndeserve a little something extra.\nBut this tipping automatically,\nthat shit's for the birds.  As far\nas I'm concerned, they're just\ndoin their job.\n\nMR. BLUE\nOur girl was nice.\n\nMR. WHITE\nOur girl was okay.  She didn't do\nanything special.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nWhat's something special, take ya\nin the kitchen and suck your dick?\n\nThey all laugh.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nI'd go over twelve percent for\nthat.\n\nMR. WRITE\nLook, I ordered coffee.  Now we've\nbeen here a long fuckin time, and\nshe's only filled my cup three\ntimes.  When I order coffee,  I\nwant it filled six times.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nWhat if she's too busy?\n\nMR. WHITE\nThe words \"too busy\" shouldn't be\nin a waitress's vocabulary.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nExcuse me, Mr. White, but the last\nthing you need is another cup of\ncoffee.\n\nThey all laugh.\n\nMR. WHITE\nThese ladies aren't starvin to\ndeath.  They make minimum wage.\nWhen I worked for minimum wage, I\nwasn't lucky enough to have a job\nthat society deemed tipworthy.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\nAhh, now we're getting down to it.\nIt's not just that he's a cheap\nbastard--\n\nMR. ORANGE\n--It is that too--\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE\n--It is that too.  But it's also\nhe couldn't get a waiter job.  You\ntalk like a pissed off dishwasher:\n\"Fuck those cunts and their\nfucking tips.\"\n\nMR. BLONDE\nSo you don't care that they're\ncounting on your tip to live?\n\nMr. White rubs two of his fingers together.\n\nMR. WHITE\nDo you know what this is?  It's\nthe world's smallest violin,\nplaying just for the waitresses.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nYou don't have any idea what\nyou're talking about.  These\npeople bust their ass. This\nis a hard job.\n\nMR. WHITE\nSo's working at McDonald's, but\nyou don't feel the need to tip\nthem.  They're servin ya food, you\nshould tip em.  But no, society\nsays tip these guys over here, but\nnot those guys over there.  That's\nbullshit.\n\nMR. ORANGE\nThey work harder than the kids at\nMcDonald's.\n\nMR. WHITE\nOh yeah, I don't see them cleaning\nfryers.\n\nMR. BROWN\nThese people are taxed on the tips\nthey make.  When you stiff 'em,\nyou cost them money.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nWaitressing is the number one\noccupation for female non-college\ngraduates in this country.  It's\nthe one jab basically any woman\ncan get, and make a living on.\nThe reason is because of tips.\n\nMR. WHITE\nFuck all that.\n\nThey all laugh.\n\nMR. WHITE\nHey, I'm very sorry that the\ngovernment taxes their tips.\nThat's fucked up.  But that ain't\nmy fault.  it would appear that\nwaitresses are just one of the\nmany groups the government fucks\nin the ass on a regular basis.\nYou show me a paper says the\ngovernment shouldn't do that, I'll\nsign it.  Put it to a vote, I'll\nvote for it.  But what I won't do\nis play ball.  And this non-\ncollege bullshit you're telling\nme, I got two words for that:\n\"Learn to fuckin type.\"  Cause if\nyou're expecting me to help out\nwith the rent, you're in for a big\nfuckin surprise.\n\nMR. ORANGE\nHe's convinced me.  Give me my\ndollar back.\n\nEverybody laughs.  Joe's comes back to the table.\n\nJOE\nOkay ramblers, let's get to\nrambling.  Wait a minute, who\ndidn't throw in?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nMr. White.\n\nJOE\n(to Mr. Orange)\nMr. White?\n(to Mr. White)\nWhy?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nHe don't tip.\n\nJOE\n(to Mr. Orange)\nHe don't tip?\n(to Mr. White)\nYou don't tip?  Why?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nHe don't believe in it.\n\nJOE\n(to Mr. Orange)\nHe don't believe in it?\n(to Mr. White)\nYou don't believe in it?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nNope.\n\nJOE\n(to Mr. Orange)\nShut up!\n(to Mr. White)\nCough up the buck, ya cheap\nbastard, I paid for your goddamn\nbreakfast.\n\nMR. WHITE\nBecause you paid for the\nbreakfast, I'm gonna tip.\nNormally I wouldn't.\n\nJOE\nWhatever.  Just throw in your\ndollar, and let's move.\n(to Mr. Blonde)\nSee what I'm dealing with here.\nInfants.  I'm fuckin dealin with\ninfants.\n\nThe eight men get up to leave.  Mr. White's waist is in\nthe F.G.  As he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's\ncarrying a gun.  They exit Uncle Bob's Pancake House,\ntalking amongst themselves.\n\n\n2      EXT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - DAY\n\nCREDIT SEQUENCE:\n\nWhen the credit sequence is finished, we    FADE TO BLACK:\n\nOver the BLACK we hear the sound of SOMEONE SCREAMING in\nagony.\n\nUnder the screaming, we hear the sound of a car HAULING\nASS, through traffic.\n\nOver the screams and the traffic noise, we hear SOMEBODY\nELSE SAY:\n\nSOMEBODY ELSE (OS)\nJust hold on buddy boy.\n\nSomebody stops screaming long enough to say:\n\nSOMEBODY (OS)\nI'm sorry.  I can't believe\nshe killed me.  Who would've\nfuckin thought that?\n\nCUT TO:\n\n3      INT. GETAWAY GAR (MOVING) - DAY\n\nThe Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange.  He lies in the\nbackseat.  He's been SHOT in the stomach.  BLOOD covers\nboth him and the backseat.\n\nMr. White is the Somebody Else.  He's behind the wheel of\nthe getaway car.  He's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and\nout of traffic.  Though he's driving for his life, he\nkeeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat.\n\nThey are the only two in the car.\n\nMR. WHITE\nHey, just cancel that shit right\nnow!  You're hurt.  You're hurt\nreally fucking bad, but you ain't\ndying.\n\nMR. ORANGE\n(crying)\nAll this blood is scaring the shit\noutta me.  I'm gonna die, I know\nit.\n\nMR. WHITE\nOh excuse me, I didn't realize you\nhad a degree in medicine.  Are you\na doctor?  Are you a doctor?\nAnswer me please, are you a\ndoctor?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nNo, I'm not!\n\nMR. WRITE\nAhhhh, so you admit you don't know\nwhat you're talking about.  So if\nyou're through giving me your\namateur opinion, lie back and\nlisten to the news.  I'm taking\nyou back to the rendezvous, Joe's\ngonna get you a doctor, the\ndoctor's gonna fix you up, and\nyou're gonna be okay.  Now say it:\nyou're gonna be okay.  Say it:\nyou're gonna be okay!\n\nMr. Orange doesn't respond.  Mr. White starts pounding on\nthe steering wheel.\n\nMR. WHITE\nSay-the-goddamn-words: you're\ngonna be okay!\n\nMR. ORANGE\nI'm okay.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(softly)\nCorrect.\n\n4      INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\nThe CAMERA does a 360 around an empty warehouse.  Then the\ndoor swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of\nMr. Orange inside.\n\nMr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit.\n\nMr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor.\n\nMR. WHITE\nJust hold on buddy boy.  Hold on,\nand wait for Joe.  I can't do\nanything for you, but when Joe\ngets here, which should be anytime\nnow, he'll be able to help you.\nWe're just gonna sit here, and\nwait for Joe.  Who are\nwe waiting for?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nJoe.\n\nMR. WHITE\nBet your sweet ass we are.\n\nMr. White gets up from over Mr. Orange and starts to prowl\naround the warehouse.\n\nMR. ORANGE\n(yelling)\nDon't leave me!\n\nMr White bends back over him and takes his hand.\n\nMR. WHITE\nI ain't going anywhere.  I'm right\nhere.  I'm not gonna leave ya.\n\nMR. ORANGE\nLarry, I'm so scared, would you\nplease hold me.\n\nMr. White very gently embraces the bloody Mr. Orange.\nCradling the young man, Mr. White whispers to him.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(whispering)\nGo ahead and be scared, you've\nbeen brave enough for one day.  I\nwant you to just relax now.\nYou're not gonna die, you're gonna\nbe fine.  When Joe gets here,\nhe'll make ya a hundred percent\nagain.\n\nMr. White lays Mr. Orange back down on the mattress.  He's\nstill holding his hand.  Mr. Orange looks up at his\nfriend.\n\nMR. ORANGE\nLook, I don't wanna be a fly in\nthe ointment, but if help doesn't\ncome soon, I gotta see a doctor.\nI don't give a fuck about jail, I\njust don't wanna die.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou're not gonna fucking die, all\nright?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nI wasn't born yesterday.  I'm\nhurt, and I'm hurt bad.\n\nMR. WHITE\nIt's not good...\n\nMR. ORANGE\nHey, bless your heart for what\nyou're trying to do.  I was\npanicking for a moment, but I've\ngot my senses back now.  The\nsituation is, I'm shot in the\nbelly.  And without medical\nattention, I'm gonna die.\n\nMR. WHITE\nI can' take you to a hospital.\n\nMR. ORANGE\nFuck jail!  I don't give a shit\nabout jail.  But I can't die.  You\ndon't have to take me in.  Just\ndrive me up to the front, drop me\non the sidewalk.  I'll take care\nof myself.  I won't tell them\nanything.  I swear to fucking god,\nI won't tell 'em anything.  Look\nin my eyes, look right in my eyes.\n(Mr. White does)\nI-won't-tell-them-anything.\nYou'll be safe.\n\nMR. WHITE\nLie back down, and try to--\n\nMR. ORANGE\nI'm going to die!   I need a\ndoctor!  I'm begging you,\ntake me to a doctor.\n\nMr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress.  Spent from\nhis outburst, he quietly mutters to himself:\n\nMR. ORANGE\nTake me to a doctor, take me to a\ndoctor, please.\n\nSuddenly, the warehouse door BURSTS open and Mr.\nPink steps inside.\n\nMR. PINK\nWas that a fucking set-up or what?\n\nMr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody.\n\nMR. PINK\nOh fuck, Orange got tagged.\n\nThroughout this scene, we hear Mr. Orange moaning.\n\nMR. WHITE\nGun shot.\n\nMR. PINK\nOh that's just fucking great!\nWhere's Brown?\n\nMR. WHITE\nDead.\n\nMR. PINK\nGoddamn, goddamn!  How did he die?\n\nMR. WHITE\nHow the fuck do you think?  The\ncops shot him.\n\nMR. PINK\nOh this is bad, this is so bad.\n(referring to Mr.\nOrange)\nIs it bad?\n\nMR. WHITE\nAs opposed to good?\n\nMR. PINK\nThis is so fucked up.  Somebody\nfucked us big time.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou really think we were set up?\n\nMR. PINK\nYou even doubt it?  I don't think\nwe got set up, I know we got set\nup!  I mean really, seriously,\nwhere did all those cops come\nfrom, huh?  One minute they're not\nthere, the next minute\nthey're there.  I didn't hear any\nsirens.  The alarm went off, okay.\nOkay, when an alarm goes off, you\ngot an average of four minutes\nresponse time.  Unless a patrol\ncar is cruising that street, at\nthat particular moment, you got\nfour minutes before they can\nrealistically respond.  In one\nminute there were seventeen blue\nboys out there.  All loaded for\nbear, all knowing exactly what the\nfuck they were doing, and they\nwere all just there!  Remember\nthat second wave that showed up in\nthe cars? Those were the ones\nresponding to the alarm.  but\nthose other motherfuckers were\nalready there, they were waiting\nfor us.\n(pause)\nYou haven't thought about this?\n\nMR. WHITE\nI haven't had a chance to think.\nFirst I was just trying to get the\nfuck outta there.  And after we\ngot away, I've just been dealin\nwith him.\n\nMR. PINK\nWell, you better start thinking\nabout it.  Cause I, sure as fuck,\nam thinking about it.  In fact,\nthat's all I'm thinking about.  I\ncame this close to just driving\noff.  Whoever set us up, knows\nabout this place.  There could've\nbeen cops sitting here waiting for\nme.  For all we know, there's\ncops, driving fast, on their way\nhere now.\n\nMR. WHITE\nLet's go in the other room...\n\nThe camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner.  We\nmove past it, and see down a hall.\n\n5      INT. BATHROOM HALLWAY - DAY\n\nAt the end of the hall is a bathroom.  The bathroom door\nis partially closed, restricting our view.  Mr. Pink is\nobscured, but Mr. White is in view.\n\nMR. PINK (OS)\nWhat the fuck am I doing here?  I\nfelt funny about this job right\noff.  As soon as I felt it I\nshould said \"No thank you\", and\nwalked.  But I never fucking\nlisten.  Every time I ever got\nburned buying weed, I always knew\nthe guy wasn't right.  I just felt\nit.  But I wanted to believe him.\nIf he's not lyin to me, and it\nreally is Thai stick, then whoa\nbaby.  But it's never Thai stick.\nand I always said if I felt that\nway about a job, I'd walk.  And I\ndid, and I didn't, because of\nfuckin money!\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat's done is done, I need you\ncool.  Are you cool?\n\nMR. PINK\nI'm cool.\n\nMR. WHITE\nSplash some water on your face.\nTake a breather.\n\nWe hear the sink running, and Mr. Pink splashing water on\nhis face.\n\nMR. WHITE\nI'm gonna get me my smokes.\n\nMr White opens the bathroom door, walks down the hall, and\nOUT OF FRAME.  We see Mr. Pink, his back turned towards\nus, bent over the sink.  Then he grabs a towels, and dries\nhis face.  Mr White ENTERS FRAME with a pack of\nChesterfields in his hand.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWant a smoke?\n\nMR. PINK\nWhy not?\n\nThe two men light up.\n\nMR. WHITE\nOkay, let's go through what\nhappened.  We're in the place,\neverything's going fine.  Then the\nalarm gets tripped.  I turn around\nand all these cops are outside.\nYou're right, it was like, bam!  I\nblink my eyes are they're there.\nEverybody starts going apeshit.\nThen Mr. Blonde starts shootin all\nthe--\n\nMR. PINK\n--That's not correct.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat's wrong with it?\n\nMR. PINK\nThe cops didn't show up after the\nalarm went off.  They didn't show\ntill after Mr. Blonde started\nshooting everyone.\n\nMR. WHITE\nAs soon as I heard the alarm, I\nsaw the cops.\n\nMR. PINK\nI'm telling ya, it wasn't that\nsoon.  They didn't let their\npresence be known until after Mr.\nBlonde went off.  I'm not sayin\nthey weren't there, I'm sayin they\nwere there.  But they didn't move\nin till Mr. Blonde became a\nmadman.  That's how I know we were\nset up.  You can see that,\ncan't you, Mr. White?\n\nMR. WHITE\nLook, enough of this \"Mr White\"\nshit--\n\nMR. PINK\n--Don't tell me your name, I don't\nwant to know!  I sure as hell\nain't gonna tell ya\nmine.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou're right, this is bad.\n(pause)\nHow did you get out?\n\nMR. PINK\nShot my way out.  Everybody was\nshooting, so I just blasted my way\noutta there.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n6      EXT. CROWDED CITY STREET - DAY\n\nMr. Pink is hauling ass down a busy city sidewalk.  He has\na canvas bag with a shoulder strap in one hand, and a .357\nMAGNUM in the other.  If any BYSTANDERS get in his way, he\njust knocks them down.  We DOLLY at the same speed, right\nalong side of him.\n\nFOUR POLICEMEN are running after Mr. Pink.  We DOLLY with\nthem.\n\nWe DOLLY with a young woman on roller skates.  ROLLERGIRL\nis plugged into a walkman.  We hear the song she's\nlistening to LOUD over the SOUNDTRACK.  She's twirling and\nskating backwards to the beat of the song.\n\nRollergirl turns a corner and COLLIDES with Mr. Pink.  The\nman and woman CRASH to the ground.\n\nMr. Pink rolls into the street, in front of a moving car\nthat SCREECHES to a stop, narrowly avoiding running over\nhim.\n\n\n7      INT. CAR (STOPPED) - DAY\n\nThe CAMERA is in the backseat. A SHOCKED WOMAN is the\ncar's driver.  Mr. Pink pulls himself up from the hood,\nshakes it off, and points his magnum at the driver.\n\nMR. PINK\nGet outta the car!  Get the fuck\noutta the car!\n\nThe Shocked Woman starts screaming.\n\nMr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's\nlocked.\n\nMR. PINK\nOpen the fucking door!\n\nEXTREME C.U. DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW\n\nMr. Pink SMASHES it in our face.\n\n\n8      EXT. STREET - DAY\n\nDOLLY with Cops coming up fast.\n\nMr. Pink DRAGS the Shocked Woman out of the car.\n\nThe Cops reach the corner, guns aimed.\n\nUsing the car as a shield, Mr. Pink FIRES three shots at\nthe Cops.\n\nEverybody HITS the ground, or scatters.\n\nMr. Pink HOPS in the car.\n\nCops FIRE.\n\n\n9      INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY\n\nCAMERA in the backseat, Mr. Pink FLOORS it.  SPEEDING down\nthe street, with the Cops FIRING after him.\n\nBACK TO:\n\n\n10     INT. BATHROOM - DAY\n\nMr. Pink and Mr. White still talking in the bathroom.\n\nMR. PINK\nTagged a couple of cops.  Did you\nkill anybody?\n\nMR. WHITE\nA few cops.\n\nMR. PINK\nNo real people?\n\nMR. WHITE\nUh-uh, just cops.\n\nMR. PINK\nCould you believe Mr. Blonde?\n\nMR. WHITE\nThat was one of the most insane\nfucking things I've ever seen.\nWhy the fuck would Joe hire\nsomebody like that?\n\nMR. PINK\nI don't wanna kill anybody.  But\nif I gotta get out that door, and\nyou're standing in my way, one way\nof the other, you're gettin outta\nmy way.\n\nMR. WHITE\nThat's the way I look at it.  A\nchoice between doin ten years, and\ntakin out some stupid\nmotherfucker, ain't no choice at\nall.  But I ain't no madman\neither.  What the fuck was Joe\nthinkin?  You can't work with a\nguy like that.  That mother-\nfucker's unstable.  What do you\nthink?  Do you think he panicked,\nor ya think he's just trigger-\nhappy?\n\nMR. PINK\nI think he's a sick fuckin maniac!\nWe're awful goddamn lucky he\ndidn't tag us, when\nhe shot up the place.  I came this\nfucking close--\n(hold up two fingers\nand makes a tiny\nspace between them)\n--to taking his ass out myself.\nEverybody panics.  When things get\ntense, everybody panics.\nEverybody.  I don't care what your\nname is, you can't help it.  It's\nhuman nature.  But ya panic on the\ninside.\nYa panic in your head.  Ya give\nyourself a couple a seconds of\npanic, then you get a grip and\ndeal with the situation.  What you\ndon't do, is shoot up the place\nand kill everybody.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat you're supposed to do is act\nlike a fuckin professional.  A\npsychopath is not a professional.\nYou can't work with a psychopath,\n'cause ya don't know what those\nsick assholes are gonna do next.\nI mean, Jesus Christ, how old do\nyou think that black girl was?\nTwenty, maybe twenty-one?\n\nMR. PINK\nDid ya see what happened to\nanybody else?\n\nMR. WHITE\nMe and Mr. Orange jumped in the\ncar and Mr. Brown floored it.\nAfter that, I don't know what went\ndown.\n\nMR. PINK\nAt that point it became every man\nfor himself.  As far as Mr. Blonde\nor Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't\ngot the foggiest.  Once\nI got out, I never looked back.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat do you think?\n\nMR. PINK\nWhat do I think?  I think the cops\ncaught them, or killed 'em.\n\nMR. WHITE\nNot even a chance they punched\nthrough?  You found a hole.\n\nMR. PINK\nYeah, and that was a fucking\nmiracle.  But if they did get\naway, where the fuck are they?\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou don't think it's possible, one\nof them got ahold of the diamonds\nand pulled a--\n\nMR. PINK\nNope.\n\nMR. WHITE\nHow can you be so sure?\n\nMR. PINK\nI got the diamonds.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhere?\n\nMR. PINK\nI got 'em, all right?\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhere?  Are they out in the car?\n\nMR. PINK\nNo, they're not in the car.  No, I\ndon't have them on me.  Ya wanna\ngo with me and get 'em?  Yes, we\ncan go right now.  But first\nlisten to what I'm telling you.\nWe were fuckin set up!  Somebody\nis in league with the cops.  We\ngot a Judas in our midst.  And I'm\nthinkin we should have our fuckin\nheads examined for waiting around\nhere.\n\nMR. WHITE\nThat was the plan, we meet here.\n\nMR. PINK\nThen where is everybody?  I say\nthe plan became null and void once\nwe found out we got a rat in the\nhouse.  We ain't got the slightest\nfuckin idea what happened to Mr.\nBlonde or Mr. Blue.  They could\nboth be dead\nor arrested.  They could be\nsweatin 'em, down at the station\nhouse right now.  Yeah they don't\nknow the names, but they can sing\nabout this place.\nI mean, that could be happening\nright now.  As we speak, the cops\ncould be in their cars, drivin\nhere this minute.\n\nMR. WHITE\nI swear to god I'm fuckin jinxed.\n\nMR. PINK\nWhat?\n\nMR. WHITE\nTwo jobs back, it was a four man\njob, we discovered one of the team\nwas an undercover cop.\n\nMR. PINK\nNo shit?\n\nMR. WHITE\nThank god, we discovered in time.\nWe hadda forget the whole fuckin\nthing.  Just walked away from it.\n\nMR. PINK\nSo who's the rat this time?  Mr.\nBlue?  Mr. Blonde?  Joe?  It's\nJoe's show, he set this whole\nthing up.  Maybe he set it up to\nset it up.\n\nMR. WHITE\nI don't buy it.  Me and Joe go\nback a long time.  I can tell ya\nstraight up, Joe definitely didn't\nhave anything to do with this\nbullshit.\n\nMR. PINK\nOh, you and Joe go back a long\ntime.  I known Joe since I was a\nkid.  But me saying Joe definitely\ncouldn't have done it is\nridiculous.  I can say I\ndefinitely didn't do it, cause I\nknow what I did or didn't do.  But\nI can't definitely say that about\nanybody else, 'cause I don't\ndefinitely know.  For all I know,\nyou're the rat.\n\nMR. WHITE\nFor all I know, you're the rat.\n\nMR. PINK\nNow you're using your head. For\nall we know, he's the rat.\n\nMr. Pink points OFFSCREEN to Mr. Orange.  Mr. White's\nexpression changes.\n\nMR. WHITE\nJesus Christ!\n\n\n11     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\nThey run over to Mr. Orange, who's unconscious.  The\nCAMERA hovers over the action.  Mr. Pink reaches him\nfirst.\n\nMR. PINK\nIs he dead?\n\nMr. White pushes him out of the way.  He feels the pulse\non Mr. Orange's neck.\n\nMR. PINK\nSo, is he dead or what?\n\nMR. WHITE\nHe ain't dead.\n\nMR. PINK\nSo what is it?\n\nMR. WHITE\nI think he's just passed out.\n\nMR. PINK\nHe scared the fuckin shit outta\nme.  I thought he was dead fer\nsure.\n\nMr. White stands up and walks over to a table.\n\nMR. WHITE\nHe will be dead fer sure, if we\ndon't get him to a hospital.\n\nMR. PINK\nWe can't take him to a hospital.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWithout medical attention, this\nman won't live through the night.\nThat bullet in his belly is my\nfault.  Now while that might not\nmean jack shit to you, it means a\nhelluva lot to me.  And I'm not\ngonna just sit around and watch\nhim die.\n\nMR. PINK\nWell, first things first, staying\nhere's goofy.  We gotta book up.\n\nMR. WHITE\nSo what do you suggest, we go to a\nhotel?  We got a guy who's shot in\nthe belly, he can't walk, he\nbleeds like a stuck pig, and when\nhe's awake, he screams in pain.\n\nMR. PINK\nYou gotta idea, spit it out.\n\nMR. WHITE\nJoe could help him.  If we can get\nin touch with Joe, Joe could get\nhim to a doctor, Joe could get a\ndoctor to come and see him.\n\nDuring Mr. Pink's dialog, we slowly ZOOM in to a\nC.U. of Mr. White.\n\nMR. PINK (OS)\nAssuming we can trust Joe, how we\ngonna get in touch with him?  He's\nsupposed to be here, but he ain't,\nwhich is making me nervous about\nbeing here.  Even if Joe is\non the up and up, he's probably\nnot gonna be that happy with us.\nJoe planned a robbery, but he's\ngot a blood bath on his hands now.\nDead cops, dead robbers, dead\ncivilians...Jesus Christ!  I tend\nto doubt he's gonna have a lot of\nsympathy for our plight.  If I was\nhim, I'd try and put as much\ndistance between me and this mess\nan humanly possible.\n\nMR. WHITE\nBefore you got here, Mr. Orange\nwas askin me to take him to a\nhospital.  Now I don't like\nturning him over to the cops, but\nif we don't, he's dead.  He begged\nme to do it.  I told him to hold\noff till Joe got here.\n\nMR. PINK (OS)\nWell Joe ain't gettin here.  We're\non our own.  Now, I don't know a\ngoddamn body who can help him, so\nif you know somebody, call 'em.\n\nMR. WHITE\nI don't know anybody.\n\nMR. PINK (OS)\nWell, I guess we drop him off at\nthe hospital.  Since he don't know\nnothin about us, I say it's his\ndecision.\n\n\nMR. WHITE'S POV:\n\nC.U. OF MR. PINK.\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nWell, he knows a little about me.\n\nMR. PINK\nYou didn't tell him your name, did\nya?\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nI told him my first name, and\nwhere I'm from.\n\nThere is a long silence and a blank look from Mr. Pink,\nthen he SCREAMS:\n\nMR. PINK\nWhy!\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nI told him where I was from a few\ndays ago.  It was just a casual\nconversation.\n\nMR. PINK\nAnd what was tellin him your name\nwhen you weren't supposed to?\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nHe asked.\n\nMr. Pink looks at Mr. White like he's retarded.\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nWe had just gotten away from the\ncops.  He just got shot.  It was\nmy fuckin fault he got shot.  He's\na fuckin bloody mess - he's\nscreaming.  I swear to god, I\nthought we was gonna die right\nthen and there.  I'm tryin to\ncomfort him, telling him not to\nworry, he's gonna be okay, I'm\ngonna take care of him.  And he\nasked me what my name was.  I\nmean, the man was dyin in my arms.\nWhat the fuck was I supposed to\ntell him, \"Sorry, I can't give out\nthat information, it's against the\nrules.  I don't trust you\nenough.\"?  Maybe I shoulda, but I\ncouldn't.\n\nMR. PINK\nOh, I don't doubt is was quite\nbeautiful--\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nDon't fuckin patronize me.\n\nMR. PINK\nOne question: Do they have a sheet\non you, where you told him you're\nfrom?\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nOf course.\n\nMR. PINK\nWell that's that, then.  I mean, I\nwas worried about mug shot\npossibilities already.  But now he\nknows: (a) what you look like, (b)\nwhat your first name is,\n(i) where you're from and (d) what\nyour specialty is.\nThey ain't gonna hafta show him a\nhelluva lot of pictures for him to\npick you out.  That's it right,\nyou didn't tell him anything else\nthat could narrow down the\nselection?\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nIf I have to tell you again to\nback off, me an you are gonna go\nround and round.\n\nMr. Pink walks out of the C.U. and turns his back on Mr.\nWhite.  Mr. White's POV PANS over to him.\n\nMR. PINK\nWe ain't taking him to a hospital.\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nIf we don't, he'll die.\n\nMR. PINK\nAnd I'm very sad about that.  But\nsome fellas are lucky, and some\nain't.\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nThat fuckin did it!\n\nMr. White's POV CHARGES toward Mr. Pink.\n\nMr. Pink turns toward him in time to get PUNCHED hard in\nthe mouth.\n\nEND OF POV\n\nMr. White and Mr. Pink have a very ungraceful and\nrealistic fight.  They go at each other like a couple of\nalley cats.\n\nAs Mr. White SWINGS and PUNCHES, he SCREAMS:\n\nMR. WHITE\n\nYou little motherfucker!\n\nMr. Pink YELLS as he HITS:\n\nMR. PINK\nYa wanna fuck with me?!  You wanna\nfuck with me?!  I'll show you who\nyou're fuckin with!\n\nThe two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING.\n\nMr. White gets Mr. Pink in a HEADLOCK.\n\nMr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it\nout.\n\nMr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink,\nand goes for his own weapon.\n\nThe two men are on the floor, on their knees, with their\nguns outstretched, aiming at one another.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou wanna shoot me, you little\npiece of shit?  Take a shot!\n\nMR. PINK\nFuck you, White!  I didn't create\nthis situation,  I'm just dealin\nwith it.  You're acting like a\nfirst-year fuckin thief.  I'm\nactin like a professional.  They\nget him, they can get you, they\nget you, they get closer to me,\nand that can't happen.  And you,\nyou motherfucker, are looking at\nme like it's my fault.  I didn't\ntell him my name.  I didn't tell\nhim where I was from.  I didn't\ntell him what I knew better than\nto tell him.  Fuck, fifteen\nminutes ago, you almost told me\nyour name.  You, buddy, are stuck\nin a situation you created.  So if\nyou wanna throw bad looks\nsomewhere, throw 'em at a mirror.\n\nMr. Pink lowers his gun and walks towards White.\n\nMR. PINK\nSo if you wanna shoot somebody,\nput that gun in your mouth and\nshoot yourself.\n\nThen from OFF SCREEN we hear:\n\nVOICE (OS)\nYou kids don't play so rough.\nSomebody's gonna start crying.\n\n\n12     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MEDIUM C.U. ON MR. BLONDE\n\nThe Voice belongs to the infamous Mr. Blonde.\n\nMr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke\nand eating a hot dog.\n\nMR. PINK\nMr. Blonde!  You okay?  We thought\nyou might've gotten caught.  What\nhappened?\n\nMr. Blonde doesn't answer, he just hops off the counter\nand starts walking around the warehouse, checking the\nplace out.\n\nHe doesn't look at either Mr. Pink or Mr. White, he\njust eats his hot dog and sips his coke.\n\nThis is making Pink and White nervous as hell.  But Mr.\nPink tries to talk through it.\n\nWe HANDHOLD follow Mr. Blonde around the warehouse.\n\nMR. PINK\nReally, how did you get away?\n\nMr. Blonde walks the loft.  Silent.\n\nMR. PINK\nYou saw what happened to me,\nI found a hole and booked.\n\nSilence.\n\nMR. PINK\nWhere's Mr. Blue?\n\nBlonde looks in the bathroom.\n\nMR. PINK\nWe were hopin you two would be\ntogether.\n\nBlonde looks out the window.\n\nMR. PINK\nThat was the big question we had,\nwhat happened to Mr.\nBlue and you?\n\nBlonde walks away from the window.\n\nMR. PINK\nWe were worried the cops got ya.\n\nBlonde bends down over Mr. Orange.\n\nMR. PINK\nHe got it in the belly.  He's\nstill alive, but won't be for\nlong.\n\nMR. WHITE\nEnough!  You better start talkin\nto us, asshole, cause we got shit\nwe need to talk about.  We're\nalready freaked out, we need you\nactin freaky like we need a fuckin\nbag on our hip.\n\nMr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime, then moves\ntowards them.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nSo, talk.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWe think we got a rat in the\nhouse.\n\nMR. PINK\nI guarantee we got a rat in the\nhouse.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nWhat would ever make you think\nthat?\n\nMR. WHITE\nIs that supposed to be funny?\n\nMR. PINK\nWe don't think this place is safe.\n\nMR. WHITE\nThis place just ain't secure\nanymore.  We're leaving, and you\nshould go with us.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nNobody's going anywhere.\n\nSilence takes over the room.  Mr. Blonde stops moving.\n\nAfter a few beats the silence is broken.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(to Mr. Pink)\nPiss on this turd, we're outta\nhere.\n\nMr. White turns to leave.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nDon't take another step, Mr.\nWhite.\n\nMr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards\nMr. Blonde.\n\nMR. WHITE\nFuck you, maniac!  It's your\nfuckin fault we're in so much\ntrouble.\n\nMr. Blonde calmly sits down.  He looks to Mr. Pink.\n\nMR. BLONDE\n(referring to Mr.\nWhite)\nWhat's this guy's problem?\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat's my problem?  Yeah, I gotta\nproblem.  I gotta big problem with\nany trigger-happy madman who\nalmost gets me shot!\n\nMR. BLONDE\nWhat're you talkin about?\n\nMR. WHITE\nThat fuckin shooting spree in the\nstore.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nFuck 'em, they set off the alarm,\nthey deserve what they got.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou almost killed me, asshole!  If\nI had any idea what type of guy\nyou were, I never would've agreed\nto work with you.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nYou gonna back all day, little\ndoggie, or are you gonna bite?\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat was that?  I'm sorry, I\ndidn't catch it.  Would you repeat\nit?\n\nMR. BLONDE\n(slowly)\nI said: \"Are you gonna bark all\nday, dog, or are you gonna bite.\"\n\nMR. PINK\nBoth of you two assholes knock it\nthe fuck off and calm down!\n\nMR. WHITE\n(to Mr. Blonde)\nSo you wanna git bit, huh?\n\nMR. PINK\nCut the bullshit, we ain't on a\nfuckin playground!\n(pause)\nI don't believe this shit, both of\nyou got ten years on me, and I'm\nthe only one actin like a\nprofessional.  You guys act like a\nbunch of fuckin niggers.  You ever\nwork a job with a bunch of\nniggers?  They're just like you\ntwo, always fightin, always sayin\nthey're gonna kill one another.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(to Mr. Pink)\nYou said yourself, you\nthought about takin him out.\n\nMR. PINK\nThen.  That time has passed.\nRight now, Mr. Blonde is the only\none I completely trust.  He's too\nfuckin homicidal to be workin with\nthe cops.\n\nMR. WHITE\nYou takin his side?\n\nMR. PINK\nFuck sides!  What we need is a\nlittle solidarity here.\nSomebody's stickin a red hot poker\nup our asses and we gotta find out\nwhose hand's on the handle.

So let's figure out\nwho's the bad guy.\n\nMr. White calms down and puts his gun away.\n\nMr. Blonde returns to the persona we saw at the beginning,\ntalking about Madonna.\n\nMR. BLONDE\nWell, that was sure exciting.\n(to Mr. White)\nYou're a big Lee Marvin fan,\naren't you?  Me too.  I don't know\nabout the rest of you fellas, but\nmy heart's\nbeatin fast.\n(pause for a beat)\nOkay you guys, follow me.\n\nMr. Blonde hops out of his chair and heads for the door.\n\nThe other two men just follow him with their eyes.\n\nMR.

He won't\nlet me leave the halfway house\ntill I get some piece of shit job.\nMy plans have always been to be\npart of the team again.\n\nThere's a KNOCK at the door.\n\nJOE\nCome in.\n\nThe door opens and in walks Joe's son, Nice Guy Eddie.\nVic turns around in his seat and sees him.\n\nEDDIE\n(to Vic)\nI see ya sittin here, but I don't\nbelieve it.\n\nVic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie.\n\nEDDIE\nHow ya doin, Toothpick?\n\nVIC\nFine, now.\n\nEDDIE\nI'm sorry man, I shoulda picked\nyou up personally at the pen.\nThis whole week's just been crazy.\nI've had my head up my ass the\nentire time.\n\nVIC\nFunny you should mention it.\nThat's what your father and I been\ntalkin about.\n\nEDDIE\nThat I should've picked you up?\n\nVIC\nNo.  That your head's been up your\nass.

My son,\nI love him, but he's taking my\nbusiness and flushing it down the\nfuckin toilet!\"\n(to Joe)\nI'm not tellin tales out of\nschool.  You tell 'im Joe.\nTell 'im yourself.\n\nJOE\nEddie, I hate like hell for you to\nhear it this way.  But when Vic\nasked me how's business, well, you\ndon't lie to a man who's just done\nfour years in the slammer for ya.\n\nEddie bobs his head up and down.\n\nEDDIE\nOh really, is that a fact?\n\nEddie JUMPS Vic and they fall to the floor.\n\nThe two friends, laughing and cussing at each other,\nwrestle on the floor of Joe's office.\n\nJoe's on his feet yelling at them.\n\nJOE\n(yelling)\nOkay, okay, enough, enough!\nPlaytime's over!  You wanna roll\naround on the floor, do it in\nEddie's office, not mine!\n\nThe two men break it up.  They are completely disheveled,\nhair a mess, shirttails out.  As they get themselves\ntogether, they continue to taunt one another.\n\nEDDIE\nDaddy, did ya see that?\n\nJOE\nWhat?\n\nEDDIE\nGuy got me on the ground, tried to\nfuck me.\n\nVIC\nYou fuckin wish.\n\nEDDIE\nYou tried to fuck me in my\nfather's office, you sick bastard.\nLook, Vic, whatever you wanna do\nin the privacy of your own home,\ngo do it.  But don't try to fuck\nme.  I don't think of you that\nway.  I mean, I like you a lot--\n\nVIC\nEddie, if I was a pirate, I\nwouldn't throw you to the crew.\n\nEDDIE\nNo, you'd keep me for yourself.\nFour years fuckin punks in the ass\nmade you appreciate prime rib when\nyou get it.\n\nVIC\nI might break you, Nice Guy, but\nI'd make you my dog's bitch.\nYou'd be suckin the dick and going\ndown on a mangy T-bone hound.\n\nEDDIE\nNow ain't that a sad sight, daddy,\nwalks into jail a white man, walks\nout talkin like a nigger.  It's\nall that black semen been shootin\nup his butt.  It's backed up into\nhis brain and comes out of his\nmouth.\n\nJOE\nAre you two finished?  We were\ntalkin about some serious shit\nwhen you came in Eddie.  We got a\nbig problem we're tryin to solve.\nNow Eddie, would you like to sit\ndown and help us solve it, or do\nyou two wanna piss fart around?\n\nPlaytime is over and Vic and Eddie know it.  So they both\ntake seats in front of Joe's desk.\n\nJOE\nNow Vic was tellin me, he's got a\nparole problem.\n\nEDDIE\nReally?  Who's your P.O.?\n\nVIC\nCraig Koons.\n\nEDDIE\nKoons?  Oh shit, I hear he's a\nmotherfucker.\n\nVIC\nHe is a motherfucker.  He won't\nlet me leave the halfway house\ntill I get some piece of shit job.\n\nEDDIE\nYou're coming back to work for us,\nright?\n\nVIC\nI wanna.  But I gotta show this\nasshole I got an honest-to-\ngoodness job before he'll let me\nmove out on my own.  I can't work\nfor you guys and be worried about\ngettin back before ten o'clock\ncurfew.\n\nJOE\n(to Eddie)\nWe can work this out, can't we?\n\nEDDIE\nThis isn't all that bad.  We can\ngive you a lot of legitimate jobs.\nPut you on the rotation at Long\nBeach as a dock worker.\n\nVIC\nI don't wanna lift crates.\n\nEDDIE\nYou don't hafta lift shit.  You\ndon't really work there.  But as\nfar as the records are concerned,\nyou do.  I call up Matthews, the\nforeman, tell him he's got a new\nguy.  You're on the schedule.  You\ngot a timecard, it's clocked in\nand out for you everyday, and you\nget a pay check at the end of the\nweek.  And ya know dock workers\ndon't do too bad.  So you can move\ninto a halfway decent place\nwithout Koons thinkin \"what the\nfuck.\"  And if Koons ever wants to\nmake a surprise visit, you're gone\nthat day.  That day we sent you to\nTustin.  We gotta bunch of shit\nyou needed to unload there.\nYou're at the Taft airstrip pickin\nup a bunch of shit and bringing it\nback.  Part of your jab is goin\ndifferent places - and we got\nplaces all over the place.\n\nJOE\n(to Vic)\nDidn't I tell ya not to worry?\n(to Eddie)\nVic was worried.\n\nEDDIE\nMe and you'll drive down to Long\nBeach tomorrow.  I'll introduce\nyou to Matthews, tell him what's\ngoing on.\n\nVIC\nThat's great, guy, thanks a bunch.\n(pause)\nWhen do you think you'll need me\nfor real work?\n\nJOE\nWell, it's kinda a strange time\nright now.  Things are kinda--\n\nEDDIE\n--Nuts.  We got a big meeting in\nVegas coming up.  And we're kinda\njust gettin ready for that right\nnow.\n\nJOE\nLet Nice Guy set you up at Long\nBeach.  Give ya some cash, get\nthat Koons fuck off your back, and\nwe'll be talking to ya.\n\nEDDIE\nDaddy, I got an idea.  Now just\nhear it out.  I know you don't\nlike to use any of the boys on\nthese jobs, but technically, Vic\nain't one of the boys.  He's been\ngone for four years.  He ain't on\nno one's list.  Ya know he can\nhandle himself, ya know you can\ntrust him.\n\nJoe looks at Vic.\n\nVic has no idea what they're talking about.\n\nJOE\nHow would you feel about pullin a\nheist with about five other guys?\n\nVIC\nWhat's the exposure like?\n\nJOE\nTwo minutes, tops.  It's a tough\ntwo minutes.  It's a hold up,\ndaylight, during business hours,\ndealing with a crowd.  But you\nhave the fellas to deal with the\ncrowd.  It's a jewelry store.\nThey're getting a big shipment of\nSouth African diamonds on a\ncertain day.  They're like a way\nstation.  It's gonna get picked up\nthe next day and sent to Hamburg.\nWhen you walk through the door,\nyou'll know right where to go for\nthe rich stones.\nThe fellas are good, me and Nice\nGuy picked em.  Nobody knows\nanybody else.  Nobody's connected.\nI don't use connected guys for\nthis shit.\n\nVIC\nWhat's the cut?\n\nJOE\nJuicy, man, real juicy.\n\nToothpick Vic smiles.\n\nSo does Nice Guy Eddie.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n15     INT.

If you\nain't a great actor you're a bad\nactor, and bad acting is bull shit\nin this job.\n\nFREDDY\n(referring to the\npapers)\nBut what is this?\n\nHOLDAWAY\nIt's a amusing anecdote about a\ndrug deal.\n\nFREDDY\nWhat?\n\nHOLDAWAY\nSomething funny that happened to\nyou while you were doing a job.\n\nFREDDY\nI gotta memorize all this shit?\n\nHOLDAWAY\nIt's like a joke.  You remember\nwhat's important, and the rest you\nmake your own.  The only way to\nmake it your own is to keep sayin\nit, and sayin it, and sayin it,\nand sayin it, and sayin it.\n\nFREDDY\nI can do that.\n\nHOLDAWAY\nThe things you gotta remember are\nthe details.  It's the details\nthat sell your story.  Now this\nstory takes place in this men's\nroom.  So you gotta know the\ndetails about this men's room.\nYou gotta know they got a blower\ninstead of a towel to dry your\nhands.  You gotta know the stalls\nain't got no doors.  You gotta\nknow whether they got liquid or\npowdered soap, whether they got\nhot water or not, 'cause if you do\nyour job when you tell your story,\neverybody should believe it.  And\nif you tell your story to somebody\nwho's actually taken a piss in\nthis men's room, and you get one\ndetail they remember right,\nthey'll swear by you.\n\n\n29     INT.  FREDDY'S APARTMENT - DAY\n\nFreddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame,\nrehearsing the anecdote.  He's reading it pretty good, but\nhe's still reading it from the page, and every once in a\nwhile he stumbles over his words.\n\nFREDDY\n...this was during the Los Angeles\nmarijuana drought of '86.  I still\nhad a connection.  Which was\ninsane, 'cause you couldn't get\nweed anyfuckinwhere then.  Anyway,\nI had a connection with this\nhippie chick up in Santa Cruz.\nAll and my friends knew it.  And\nthey'd give me a call and say,\n\"Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you\nthink you could buy me some too?\"\nThey knew I smoked, so they'd ask\nme to buy a little for them when I\nwas buyin.  But it got to be\neverytime I bought some weed, I\nwas buyin for four or five\ndifferent people.  Finally I said,\n\"Fuck this shit.\"  I'm makin this\nbitch rich.  She didn't have to do\njack shit, she never even had to\nmeet these people.  I was fuckin\ndoin all the work.  So I got\ntogether with her and told her,\n\"Hey, I'm sick of this shit.  I'm\ncomin through for everybody, and\nnobody's comin through for me.\nSo, either I'm gonna tell all my\nfriends to find their own source,\nor you give me a bunch of weed,\nI'll sell it to them, give you the\nmoney, minus ten percent, and I\nget my pot for free.\"  So, I did\nif for awhile...\n\nFreddy exits frame\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n30     EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY\n\nAnother empty frame, except obviously outside.  Freddy\nenters frame from the same direction he exited in the\nprevious scene, finishing his sentence.  When we move to a\nwider shot we see Freddy performing his monolog to\nHoldaway in a parking lot.  Holdaway sits on the hood of\nhis beat-up car.  Freddy paces back and forth as he\nperforms his story.\n\nFREDDY\n...but then that got to be a pain\nin the ass.  People called me on\nthe phone all the fuckin time.  I\ncouldn't rent a fuckin tape\nwithout six phone calls\ninterrupting me.  \"Hey, Freddy,\nwhen's the next time you're gettin\nsome?\"  \"Motherfucker, I'm tryin\nto watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have\nsome, I'll let you know.\"  And\nthen these rinky-dink pot heads\ncome by--there's my friends and\neverything, but still.  I got all\nmy shit laid out in sixty dollar\nbags.  Well, they don't want sixty\ndollars worth.  They want ten\ndollars worth.  Breaking it up is\na major fuckin pain in the ass.  I\ndon't even know how much ten\ndollars worth is.  \"Well, fuck,\nman, I don't want that much\naround.  If I have that much\naround I'll smoke it.\"  \"Hey, if\nyou guys can't control your\nsmokin, that's not my problem.\nYou motherfuckers been smokin for\nfive years, be a adult about it.\"\nFinally I just told my connection,\ncount me out.  But as it turns\nout, I'm the best guy she had, and\nshe depended alot on my business.\nBut I was still sick to death of\nit.  And she's trying to talk me\ninto not quitin.\nNow this was a very weird\nsituation, 'cause I don't know if\nyou remember back in '86, there\nwas a major fuckin drought.\nNobody and anything.  People were\nlivin on resin and smokin the wood\nin their pipes for months.  And\nthis chick had a bunch, and was\nbeggin me to sell it.  So I told\nher I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot\nMan anymore.  But I would take a\nlittle bit and sell it to my\nclose, close, close friends.  She\nagreed to that, and said we'd keep\nthe same arrangement as before,\nten percent and free pot for me,\nas long as I helped her out that\nweekend.  She had a brick of weed\nshe was sellin, and she didn't\nwant to go to the buy alone...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n31     INT.  BOOTS AND SOCKS BAR - NIGHT\n\nFreddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a\ntable in a red-lighted smokey bar.  Freddy continues his\nstory.  The crooks are enjoying the hell out of it.\n\nFREDDY\n...Her brother usually goes with\nher, but he's in county\nunexpectedly.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat for?\n\nFREDDY\nTraffic tickets gone to warrant.\nThey stopped him for something,\nfound the warrants on 'im, took\n'im to jail.  She doesn't want to\nwalk around alone with all that\nweed.  Well, I don't wanna do\nthis, I have a bad feeling about\nit, but she keeps askin me, keeps\naskin me, finally I said okay\n'cause I'm sick of listening to\nit.  Well, we're picking this guy\nup at the train station.\n\nJOE\nYou're picking the buyer up at the\ntrain station?  You're carrying\nthe weed on you?\n\nFREDDY\nYeah, the guy needed it right\naway.  Don't ask me why.  So we\nget to the train station, and\nwe're waitin for the guy.  Now I'm\ncarrying the weed in one of those\ncarry-on bags, and I gotta take a\npiss.  So I tell the connection\nI'll be right back, I'm goin' to\nthe little boys room...\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n32     INT.  MEN'S ROOM - TRAIN STATION - DAY\n\nMEDIUM ON FREDDY\n\nHe walks through the door with a carry-on bag over his\nshoulder.  Once he's inside, he stops in his tracks.  We\nmove into a CU.\n\nFREDDY (V.O.)\n...So I walk into the men's room,\nand who's standing there?\n\nFREEZE FRAME\n\non Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles County\nSheriffs and one German Shepherd.  All of their eyes are\non Freddy.  Everyone is frozen.\n\nFREDDY (V.O.)\n...six Los Angeles County Sheriffs\nand a German Shepherd.\n\nNICE GUY EDDIE (V.O.)\nThey were waiting for you?\n\nFREDDY (V.O.)\nNo.  They were just a bunch of\ncops hangin out in the men's room,\ntalkin.  When I walked through the\ndoor they all stopped what they\nwere talking about and looked at\nme.\n\n\n33     BACK TO BAR\n\nECU MR. WHITE\n\nMR. WHITE\nThat's hard, man.  That's a fuckin\nhard situation.\n\n\n34     BACK TO MEN'S ROOM\n\nECU GERMAN SHEPHERD\n\nbarking his head off.\n\nFREDDY (V.O.)\nThe German Shepherd starts\nbarkin'.  He's barkin' at me.  I\nmean it's obvious he's barkin' at\nme.\n\nWe do a slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room.  We can\nhear the dog barking.\n\nFREDDY (V.O.)\nEvery nerve ending, all of my\nsenses, the blood in my veins,\neverything I has was screaming,\n\"Take off, man, just take off, get\nthe fuck outta there!\"  Panic hit\nme like a bucket of water.  First\nthere was the shock of it--BAM,\nright in the face!  Then I'm just\nstandin there drenched in panic.\n\nSLOW MOTION\n\nCAMERA does a PAN from face to face of the sheriffs.\n\nFREDDY (V.O.)\nAnd all those sheriffs are lookin\nat me and they know. They can\nsmell it.  As sure as that fuckin\ndog cam, they can smell it on me.\n\nFREEZE FRAME\n\nBack to the same freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in\nfront of the sheriffs.  It suddenly jerks to life, and\nmoves to speed.  The dog is barking.  Freddy moves to his\nright, out of frame.  We stay on the sheriffs.  One\nsheriff yells at the dog.\n\nSHERIFF #1\nShut up!\n\nThe dog quiets down.  Sheriff #2 continues with his story.\nA couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen,\nbut as Sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him.\n\nSHERIFF #2\nSo my gun's drawn, right?  I got\nit aimed right at him.  I tell\n'em, \"Freeze, don't fuckin move.\"\nAnd the little idiot's lookin at\nme, nodding his head \"Yes,\" sayin\n\"I know...I know...I know.\"\nMeanwhile his right hand is\ncreepin towards his glove box.  So\nI scream at him, \"Asshole, you\nbetter fuckin freeze right now!\"\nAnd he's still lookin right at me,\nsaying\n\"I know...I know...I know.\"  And\nhis right hand's still going for\nthe glove box.\n\nThe CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up\nagainst the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss.\n\nSHERIFF #2 (O.S.)\nI tell 'im, \"Buddy, I'm gonna\nshoot you in the face right now if\nyou don't put your hands on the\nfuckin dash.\"  And the guy's\ngirlfriend, a real sexy Oriental\nbitch, starts screamin at him,\n\"Chuck, are you out of your mind?\nPut your hands on the dash like\nthe officer said.\"  And then like\nnothing, the guy snaps out of it\nand casually puts his hands on the\ndash.\n\nFreddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past\nthe sheriffs over to the sink.  The CAMERA PANS with him.\nA sheriff is sitting on a sink.  He looks down and watches\nFreddy wash his hands.\n\nSHERIFF #1\nWhat was he goin for?\n\nSHERIFF #2\nHis registration.  Stupid fuckin\ncitizen, doesn't have the\nslightest idea how close he came\nto gettin shot.\n\nFreddy finishes washing his hands.  He goes to dry them,\nbut there's only those hand drying machines.  Freddy turns\non the drying machine.  He can't hear anything the\nsheriffs say now.  The sound of the machine dominates the\nsound track.\n\nThese following shots are SLOW MOTION.\n\nCU OF FREDDY\n\nCU of his HANDS, rubbing each other getting blown dry\n\nSHOT OF SHERIFFS talking.  We can't hear them because of\nthe machine.\n\nCU OF MACHINE\n\nMEDIUM OF SHERIFF ON SINK, smoking a cigarette, glancing\nover at Freddy.\n\nCU OF GERMAN SHEPHERD\n\nMachine turns off.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n35     INT.

HOLDAWAY'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nHoldaway sits behind his desk.  Freddy sits on the edge of\nthe desk eating a Double-Double with cheese.  They look\ninto the CAMERA.\n\nWe hear Jodie's voice OFFSCREEN.\n\nJODIE (OS)\nLawrence \"Larry\" Dimick.  Also\nknown as Lawrence Jacobs and Alvin\n\"Al\" Jacobs.  This guy is Mr. Joe-\nArmed-Robbery.  He's\na pro and he makes it a habit not\nto get caught.\n\n\nMEDIUM SHOT OF JODIE\n\nDOLLY slowly into C.U.\n\nJODIE\nHe's only been convicted twice,\nwhich is pretty good for somebody\nliving a life of crime.  Once for\narmed robbery, when he was twenty-\none, in Milwaukee.\n\n\nC.U. FREDDY\n\nFREDDY\nWhat was it?\n\n\nJODIE\n\nJODIE\nPayroll office at a lumber yard.\nFirst offense - he got eighteen\nmonths.  He didn't get busted\nagain until he was thirty-two.\nAnd then it was a backdoor bust.\nA routine vice squad roust.  They\nroust this bar, out buddy Lawrence\nis in there knocking down a few.\nHe gets picked up.  He's wearing\non his person an outlaw .45\nautomatic, apparently his weapon\nof choice.  Also, on his finger is\na diamond ring from a jewelry\nstore robbery a year earlier.  He\ngot two years back inside for\nthat.\n\n\nTWO SHOT OF HOLDAWAY AND FREDDY\n\nFreddy winces.\n\nFREDDY\nGoddamn, that's hard time.\n\n\nJODIE\n\nJODIE\nSo far, it's the only time he's\never done.\n\n\nCU HOLDAWAY\n\nHOLDAWAY\nWas this vice squad bullshit in\nMilwaukee?\n\n\nJODIE\n\nJODIE\nNo.  The vice squad roust was in\nL.A.  He's been in Los Angeles\nsince '77.\n\n\nDOLLY BEHIND HOLDAWAY'S DESK\n\nfrom left to right.\n\nFREDDY\nWhen did he do this time?\n\nJODIE\nBack in '83, got out late '86.  I\nfound something else out I think\nyou two should be aware of.\nAbout a year and a half ago, up in\nSacramento, an undercover cop,\nJohn Dolenz, worked his way into a\nbank job.  Apparently before the\njob they found out he was a cop.\nNow picture this:  It's Dolenz's\nbirthday, a bunch of cops are\nwaiting in his apartment for a\nsurprise party.  The door opens,\neveryone yells \"Surprise!\", and\nstanding in the doorway is Dolenz\nand this other guy sticking a gun\nin Dolenz's ribs.  Before anybody\nknows what's going on, this\nstranger shoots Dolenz dead and\nstarts firing two .45 automatics\ninto the crowd.\n\nHOLDAWAY\nWhat happened?\n\nThe DOLLY moves behind Jodie.\n\nJODIE\nIt was a mess.  Cops got hit,\nwives got hit, girlfriends got\nhit, his dog got hit.  People got\nglass in their faces.  Three were\nkilled, six were wounded.\n\nFREDDY\nThey couldn't pin the killing on\none of the bank robbers?\n\nJODIE\nThey tried, but they didn't have a\npositive I.D. and all those guys\nhad alibis.  Besides, we really\ndidn't have anything on them.  We\nhad the testimony of a dead man\nthat they were talking\nabout committing a robbery.  They\nnever went ahead with the bank\njob.\n\nThe DOLLY completes its circle.\n\nFREDDY\nAnd Larry Dimick was one of the\nboys?\n\nJODIE\nHe was probably the one.\n\n\nON HOLDAWAY\n\nHOLDAWAY\nJust how sure are you with your\ncover?\n\nPAN to C.U. on Freddy.\n\nFREDDY\nToday they may know something,\ntomorrow they may know something\nelse.  But yesterday they didn't\nknow anything.\n\n\nC.U. OF MR. WHITE'S MUG SHOT\n\nFREDDY (OS)\nWhat's the next step?\n\nHOLDAWAY (OS)\nDo what they told ya.

We MOVE\nUP to his face.\n\nFear.\n\nFREDDY\n(to himself)\nDon't pussy out on me now.  They\ndon't know.  They don't know shit.\n(pause)\nYou're not gonna get hurt.

PINK\nGo ahead and laugh, you know what\nI mean.  What a while bitch will\nput up with, a black bitch won't\nput up with for a minute.  They\ngot a line, and if you cross it,\nthey fuck you up.\n\nEDDIE\nI gotta go along with Mr. Pink on\nthis.  I've seen it happen.\n\nMR. WHITE\nOkay, Mr. Expert. If this is such\na truism, how come every nigger I\nknow treats his woman like a piece\nof shit?\n\nMR. PINK\nI'll make you a bet that those\nsame damn niggers who were showin\ntheir ass in public, when their\nbitches get 'em home, they chill\nthe fuck out.\n\nMR. WHITE\nNot these guys.\n\nMR. PINK\nYeah, those guys too.\n\nEDDIE\nLet me tell you guys a story.  In\none of daddy's clubs there was\nthis black cocktail waitress named\nElois.\n\nMR. WHITE\nElois?\n\nEDDIE\nYeah, Elois. E and Lois.  We\ncalled her Lady E.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhere was she from, Compton?\n\nEDDIE\nNo.  She was from Ladora Heights.\n\nMR. PINK\nThe black Beverly Hills.  I knew\nthis lady from Ladora Heights\nonce.\n(in a stuck up black\nfemale voice)\n\"Hi, I'm from Ladora Heights, it's\nthe black Beverly Hills.\"\nEDDIE\nIt's not the black Beverly Hills,\nit's the black Palos Verdes.\nAnyway, this chick, Elois, was a\nman-eater-upper.  I bet every guy\nwho's ever met her has jacked off\nto her at least once.  You know\nwho she looked like?  Christie\nLove.  'Member that TV show \"Get\nChristie Love\"?  She was a black\nfemale cop.  She always used to\nsay \"You're under arrest, sugar.\"\n\nMR. PINK\nI was in the sixth grade when that\nshow was on.  I totally dug it.\nWhat the fuck was the name of the\nchick who played Christie\nLove?\n\nEDDIE\nPam Grier.\n\nMR. PINK\nNo, it wasn't Pan Grier, Pan Grier\nwas the other one.  Pan Grier made\nthe movies.  Christie Love was\nlike a Pam Grier TV show, without\nPam Grier.\n\nMR. PINK\nWhat the fuck was that chick's\nname?  Oh this is just great, I'm\ntotally fuckin tortured now.\n\nEDDIE\nWell, whoever she was, Elois\nlooked like her.  So one night I\nwalk into the club, and no Elois.\nNow the bartender was a wetback,\nhe was a friend of mine, his name\nwas Carlos.\nSo I asked him \"Hey, Carlos,\nwhere's Lady E tonight?\"  Well\napparently Lady E was married to\nthis real piece of dog shit.  I\nmean a real animal.  And\napparently he would so things to\nher.\n\nFREDDY\n\nDo things?  What would he do?  You\nmean like beat her up?\n\nEDDIE\nNobody knows for sure what he did.\nWe just know he did something.\nAnyway, Elois plays it real cool.\nAnd waits for the next time this\nbag of shit gets drunk.  So one\nnight the guy gets drunk and\npasses out on the couch.  So while\nthe guy's\ninebriated, she strips him naked.\nThen she takes some crazy glue and\nglues his dick to his belly.\n\nThe car reacts to how horrible that would be.\n\nEDDIE\nI'm dead fuckin serious.  She put\nsome on his dick and some on his\nbelly, then stuck 'em together.\nThe paramedics had to come and cut\nit loose.\n\nThe car reacts badly.\n\nMR. WHITE\nJesus Christ!\n\nFREDDY\nYou can do some crazy things with\nit.\n\nEDDIE\nI don't know what he did to her,\nbut she got even.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWas he all pissed off?\n\nMR. PINK\nHow would you feel if you had to\ndo a handstand every time you took\na piss.\n\nThe car laughs.\n\n\n42     EXT.

WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\nThe four men enter the building.\n\nAt the other end of the warehouse, sitting in chairs, are\nMr. Blonde, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue and Joe Cabot.\n\nWe shoot this from OVERHEAD, looking down on the men.\n\nJOE\n(to everybody)\n...So they're talkin about how\nthey get their wives off, and the\nFrench guys says:\n(in a bad French\naccent)\n\"All I gotta do is take my pinky\nand tickle my Fifi's little oo la\nla  and she rises a foot off the\nbed.\"\n\nBack to Joe.\n\nSo the dago says:\n\n\nCU ON JOE\n\nJOE\n(in a good Brooklyn\naccent)\n\"That's nothin.  When I take the\ntip of my tongue and wiggle it\nagainst my Mary Louise's little\nfun pimple, she rises two feet off\nda bed.\"  Then our friend from\nPoland says:\n(in dumb voice)\n\"You guys ain't no cocksmen. When\nI get through fuckin my Sophie, I\nwipe my dick on the curtains and\nyou know what?  She hits the\nroof!\"\n\nJoe laughs like a crazy man.\n\nJOE\nHa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!\n\nWe hear a lot of laughing OFF SCREEN.\n\nJOE\nAin't that a masterpiece?  Stupid\nfuckin Polack, wipes his dick on\nthe drapes.\n\nJoe's eyes greet the new arrivals.\n\nJOE\nYou're here, great!\n\nJoe EXITS C.U.\n\nWe now have everybody from the Uncle Bob's Pancake House\nscene together again.  Some sit on folding chairs, some\nstand.  Joe sits in front of them on the edge of a table.\nA blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store is off to\nthe right.\n\nWe do a 360 around the men.\n\nEDDIE\nWe woulda gotten here sooner, but\nwe got backed up around La Brea\nand Pico.\n\nJOE\nNo hurry.\n(to the boys)\nAll right, let's get to know one\nanother.  With the exception of\nEddie and myself, who you already\nknow, you'll be using aliases.\nUnder no circumstances are you to\ntell one another your real name or\nanything else about yourself.\nThat includes where you're from,\nyour wife's name, where you\nmight've done time, about a bank\nin St. Petersburg you might've\nrobbed.  You guys don't say shit\nabout who you are, where you been\nor what you've done.  Only thing\nyou guys can talk about is what\nyou're going to do.  This way the\nonly ones who know who the members\nof the team are are Eddie and\nmyself.  And that's the way I like\nit.  Because in the unlikely event\nof one of you getting apprehended\nby the cops, not that I expect\nthat to happen - it most\ndefinitely should not happen - it\nhasn't happened, you don't have\nanything to deal with.  You don't\nknow any names.  You know my name,\nyou know Eddie's name.  That I\ndon't care about.  You gotta prove\nit.  I ain't worried.  Besides,\nthis way you gotta trust me.  I\nlike that.  I set this up and\npicked the men I wanted for it.\nNone of you came to me, I\napproached all of you.  I know\nyou.  I know your work, I know\nyour reputation.  I know you as\nmen.  Except for this guy.\n\nJoe points a finger at Freddy.\n\nFreddy shits a brick.\n\nJOE\nBut he's OK.  If he wasn't OK, he\nwouldn't be here.  Okay, let me\nintroduce everybody to everybody.\nBut once again, at the risk of\nbeing redundant, if I even think I\nhear somebody telling or referring\nto somebody by their Christian\nname...\n(Joe searches for the\nright words)\n...you won't want to be you.\nOkay, quickly.\n(pointing at the men\nas he gives them a\nname)\nMr. Brown, Mr. White, Mr. Blonde,\nMr. Blue, Mr. Orange, and Mr.\nPink.\n\nMR. PINK\nWhy am I Mr. Pink?\n\nJOE\nCause you're a faggot.\n\nEverybody laughs.\n\nMR. PINK\nWhy can't we pick out our own\ncolors?\n\nJOE\nI tried that once, it don't work.\nYou get four guys fighting over\nwho's gonna be Mr. Black.  Since\nnobody knows anybody else, nobody\nwants to back down.  So forget it,\nI pick.  Be thankful you're not\nMr. Yellow.\n\nMR. BROWN\nYeah, but Mr. Brown?  That's too\nclose to Mr. Shit.\n\nEverybody laughs.\n\nMR. PINK\nYeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr.\nPussy.  Tell you what, let me be\nMr. Purple.  That sounds good to\nme, I'm Mr. Purple.\n\nJOE\nYou're not Mr. Purple, somebody\nfrom another job's Mr. Purple.\nYou're Mr. Pink.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWho cares what your name is?  Who\ncares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr.\nPurple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...\n\nMR. PINK\nOh that's really easy for you to\nsay, you're Mr. White.  You gotta\ncool-sounding name.  So tell me,\nMr. White, if you think \"Mr. Pink\"\nis no big deal, you wanna trade?\n\nJOE\nNobody's trading with anybody!\nLook, this ain't a goddamn fuckin\ncity counsel meeting!  Listen up\nMr. Pink.  We got two ways here,\nmy way or the highway.  And you\ncan go down either of 'em.  So\nwhat's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?\n\nMR. PINK\nJesus Christ, Joe.  Fuckin forget\nit.  This is beneath me.  I'm Mr.\nPink, let's move on.\n\nCAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard\nwith the layout of the jewelry store on it.\n\nJOE (OS)\nOkay fellas, let's get into this.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n44     EXT. BLEACHERS - DAY\n\nFreddy and Holdaway sit on some bleachers in an empty\nlittle league baseball field.\n\nHOLDAWAY\nOkay, we're gonna station men\nacross the street from Karina's\nFine Jewelry.  But their orders\nwill be not to move in unless the\nrobbery gets out of control.  You\ngotta make sure they don't have to\nmove in.  You're inside to make\nsure that everything goes\naccording to Hoyle.  We have men\nset up a block away from the\nwarehouse rendezvous.  They got\ncomplete visibility of the\nexterior.  So as soon as Joe Cabot\nshows up, we'll see it.\n\nFREDDY\nWhat's your visibility of the\ninterior?\n\nHOLDAWAY\nWe can't see shit on the inside.\nAnd we can't risk gettin any\ncloser for fear they'll spot us.\n\nFREDDY\nThis is bullshit, Jim.  I get all\nthe fuckin danger of having you\nguys in my back pocket but none of\nthe safety.\n\nHOLDAWAY\nWhat's the matter, Newendyke?  Job\ntoo tough for ya?  No one lied to\nyou.  You always knew we'd hang\nback until Joe Cabot showed up.\n\nFREDDY\nOh this is great.  You ain't\ngiving me no fuckin protection\nwhatsoever.  But you are giving me\nan attitude.\n\nHOLDAWAY\nSince when does an undercover cop\nhave protection?  Freddy, you came\ninto this thing with your eyes\nwide open, so don't start screamin\nblind man now.  I understand\nyou're nervous.  I wish the\nwarehouse had more visible\nwindows, but it doesn't.  We have\nto make do with the cards we're\ndealt.\n\nFREDDY\nI didn't say I wasn't gonna do it.\nI'm just remarking on how shitty\nthe situation is!\n\nHOLDAWAY\nI don't mean to be harsh with ya,\nbut I've found tough love works\nbest in these situations.  We have\nto get Joe Cabot in the company of\nthe thieves and in the same\nvicinity as the loot.\nWe don't care about these other\nbastards.  We're willing to offer\nthem good deals to testify against\nCabot.\n\nFREDDY\nIsn't this risk unorthodox?\n\nHOLDAWAY\nWhat?\n\nFREDDY\nLetting them go ahead with the\nrobbery?\n\nHOLDAWAY\nThe whole idea behind this\noperation is to catch Joe Cabot\nred-handed.  We bust these hired\nhands, we ain't accomplished shit.\nLetting them go through with the\nheist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs\nare very clean.  We got people\nsurrounding the perimeter.  We got\na guy and a gal on the inside\nposing as a couple shopping for\nrings.  We could replace the\nemployees with cops, but we'd run\nthe risk of tipping 'em off.\n\nFREDDY\nThat's out.  They know the faces\nof who works what shift.\n\nHOLDAWAY\nThese guys are professionals.\nWe're professionals.  It's a risk,\nbut I think it's a calculated\nrisk.\n\n\n45     EXT. KARINA'S FINE JEWELRY - DAY\n\nWe see MOS SHOTS of the outside of the jewelry store.\n\nCUSTOMERS coming and going.  STORE CLERKS waiting on\ncustomers through the windows.\n\nWhile we look at this we HEAR over the soundtrack Mr.\nWhite and Freddy talking OFF SCREEN.\n\nMR. WHITE (VO)\nLet's go over it.  Where are you?\n\nFREDDY (VO)\nI stand outside and guard the\ndoor.  I don't let anybody come in\nor go out.\n\nMR. WHITE (VO)\nMr. Brown?\n\nFREDDY (VO)\nMr. Brown stays in the car.  He's\nparked across the street till I\ngive him the signal, then he pulls\nup in front of the store.\n\nMR. WHITE (VO)\nMr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?\n\nFREDDY (VO)\nCrowd control.  They handle\ncustomers and employees in the\ndisplay area.\n\n\n46     INT. MR. WHITE'S CAR (PARKED) - DAY\n\nMr. White and Freddy sit in a car parked across the street\nfrom the jewelry store, staking it out.\n\nMR. WHITE\nMyself and Mr. Pink?\n\nFREDDY\nYou two take the manager in the\nback and make him give you the\ndiamonds.  We're there for those\nstones, period.  Since no display\ncases are being fucked with, no\nalarms should go off.  We're out\nof there in two minutes, not one\nsecond longer.  What if the\nmanager won't give up the\ndiamonds?\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhen you're dealing with a store\nlike this, they're insured up the\nass.  They're not supposed to give\nyou and resistance\nwhatsoever.  If you get a customer\nor an employee who thinks he's\nCharles Bronson, take the butt of\nyour gun and smash their nose in.\nDrops 'em right to the floor.\nEveryone jumps, he falls down,\nscreaming, blood squirts out his\nnose.  Freaks everybody out.\nNobody says fuckin shit after\nthat.  You might get some bitch\ntalk shit to ya.  But give her a\nlook, like you're gonna smash her\nin the face next.  Watch her shut\nthe fuck up.  Now if it's a\nmanager, that's a different story.\nThe managers know better than to\nfuck around.  So if one's givin\nyou static, he probably thinks\nhe's a real cowboy.  So what you\ngotta do is break that son-of-a-\nbitch in two.  If you wanna know\nsomething and he won't tell you,\ncut off one of his fingers.  The\nlittle one.  Then you tell 'im his\nthumb's next.  After that he'll\ntell ya if he wears ladies\nunderwear.  I'm hungry, let's get\na taco.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n\n47     EXT. ALLEY - DAY\n\nIt's the moment of the robbery.  The alley is empty.\n\nIn the distance we hear all hell breaking loose.  Guns\nFIRING, people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING,\nglass BREAKING...\n\nA car whips around the corner, into the alley.\n\nThe doors BURST open, Freddy and Mr. White hop out.\n\nFreddy opens the driver's side door.  A bloody SCREAMING\nMr. Brown FALLS out.\n\nMR. BROWN\n(screaming)\nMy eyes!  My eyes!  I'm blind, I'm\nfucking blind!\n\nFREDDY\nYou're not blind, there's just\nblood in your eyes.\n\nMr. White loads his two .45 automatics.  He RUNS to the\nend of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT.\n\nFIRING both .45's, Mr. White massacres everyone in the\npatrol car.\n\nFreddy, holding the dying Mr. Brown, looks on at Mr.\nWhite's ambush in shock.\n\nMr. Brown lifts his head up, blood in his eyes.\n\nMR. BROWN\nMr. Orange?  You're Mr. Orange,\naren't you?\n\nBy the time Freddy turns his head back to him, Mr. Brown\nis dead.\n\nMr. White RUNS up to Freddy.\n\nMR. WHITE\nIs he dead?\n\nFreddy doesn't answer, he can't.\n\nMR. WHITE\nDid he did or not?\n\nFreddy, scared.\n\nFREDDY\nI'm sorry.\n\nMR. WHITE\nWhat?  Snap out of it!\n\nMr. White GRABS Freddy by the coat and YANKS him along as\nhe RUNS.\n\nThey EXIT the alley and FLEE down a street.\n\nA car with a FEMALE DRIVER comes up on the two men.\n\nMr. White JUMPS in her path, stopping the car.  He points\nhis jun at her.\n\nMR. WHITE\nGet us outta here!\n\nMr. White climbs into the backseat.\n\nFreddy starts to climb in.\n\nThe Female driver comes up with a gun from under her seat.\n\nMR. WHITE\nThe bitch's got a gun!\n\nShe SHOOTS Freddy in the stomach.\n\nOn instinct Freddy brings up his gun and SHOOTS her in the\nface.\n\n\nC.U. ON FREDDY\n\nas he FALLS to the ground he realizes what's happened\nto him and what he's done.  SLOW MOTION.\n\nMr White DRAGS the dead female driver out of the car.  He\nSHOVES Freddy in the backseat and DRIVES away.\n\n\n48     INT. GETAWAY CAR (MOVING) - DAY\n\nFreddy holding his stomach and doubled over in pain is\nCRYING.\n\nWe replay the scene between Freddy and Mr. White in the\ngetaway car.  Except this time, we never leave Freddy.\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nJust hold on buddy boy.\n\nFREDDY\nI'm sorry.  I can't believe she\nkilled me...\n\n\nCUT FROM FREDDY IN THE BACKSEAT TO:\n\n\n49     INT. NICE GUY EDDIE'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY\n\nMr. Pink is behind the wheel, Nice Guy Eddie is in the\npassenger seat going through the satchel with the\ndiamonds.  Mr. White is in the backseat.  The car is\nSPEEDING back to the garage.\n\nEDDIE\n(looking through the\ncase)\nYou know, all things considered,\nthis was pretty successful.\n\nMR. WHITE\nI don't believe you just said\nthat.\n\nEDDIE\nNo, it was messy as hell, but do\nyou realize how much you got away\nwith?  There's over two million\ndollars worth of diamonds here.\n\nMR. PINK\nI love this guy.\n\nEDDIE\nHey, what's done is done.  We can\nall sit around and have a big cry\nabout it or we can deal with the\nsituation at hand.\n\nMR. WHITE\nThe situation as hand isn't that\nfuckin satchel.  You and Joe have\na responsibility to your men.\n\nEDDIE\nHey, it's the best I could do.\n\nMR. WHITE\nThe man is fucking dying.\n\nEDDIE\nAnd I'm telling you, Bonnie'll\ntake care of him.\n\nMR. WHITE\nHe needs a doctor, not a fuckin\nnurse.\n\nEDDIE\nAsk me how many doctors I called.\nYou wanna embarrass yourself, ask\nme how many doctors I called.\n\nMR. WHITE\nObviously not enough.\n\nEDDIE\nFuck you! You gotta little black\nbook, then whip is out.  If not,\nlisten how it is.  I called three\ndoctors and couldn't get through\nto shit.  Now, time being a\nfactor, I called Bonnie.  Sweet\nbroad, helluva broad, and a\nregistered nurse.  Told her a\nbullshit story, upside:  she said\nbring him to her apartment.\n\nMR. WHITE\nIf he dies I'm holding you\npersonally responsible.\n\nEDDIE\nFuck you buddy boy!  Okay, you\nwanna play that way.  I am\npersonally leaving myself\nvulnerable with this Bonnie\nsituation.  I don't think she'll\ncall the cops, but I don't know\nfor sure.  But me being too nice-\na-fuckin-guy was willin to risk\nit.  But no fuckin more.\n(he grabs his\nportable phone)\nI'm callin Bonnie back and tellin\nher to forget it.  You take care\nof your friend, you know so much\nabout it.\n\nMR. PINK\nGoddamnit, will you guys grow up!\n\nEDDIE\nI don't need to grow up, my\nfriend.  I am a grown up.  I'm\nbeing responsible, I'm taking care\nof business.\n\nMR. WHITE\nCut the shit!  I don't think you\ncalled anybody except some cooze\nyou once fucked, who happens to\nwear orthopedic shoes.  And I\ndon't think that's good enough\ncare for a gut-shot man.\n\nEDDIE\nYeah, well I don't give a flying\nfuck what you think!\n\nMR. PINK\n(to Mr. White)\nLook, he's not sayin this bitch is\ngonna operate on him.  She's gonna\ngive him better attention than we\ncan until we can get a doctor.\nNobody's forgotten about doctors.\nJoe'll get one in a snap.  This is\nsomething we're doing in the\nmeantime.  I think both of you are\nactin like a couple of assholes.\n\nEDDIE\nYeah, right.  I arrange a nurse, I\nleave myself wide open, and I'm an\nasshole.\n\n\n50     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY\n\nMEDIUM SHOT on the door.  Nice Guy Eddie, Mr. White and\nMr. Pink walk through it.  They stop in their tracks.\n\nWe see what they see.  Mr. Blonde, lying on the ground,\nshot full of holes.  The cop slumped over in his chair, a\nbloody mess, Mr. Orange lying at the cop's feet, holding\nhis wound.  Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk into the\nshot.\n\nEDDIE\nWhat the fuck happened here?\n\nEddie runs over to his friend Mr. Blonde/Toothpick Vic.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(to Mr. Orange)\nWhat happened?\n\nMR. ORANGE\n(very weakly)\nBlonde went crazy.  He slashed the\ncop's face, cut off his ear and\nwas gonna burn him alive.\n\nEDDIE\n(yelling)\nWho cares what he was gonna do to\nthis fuckin pig?\n\nEddie whips out his gun and SHOOTS the cop.  The cop and\nthe chair tip over.  Eddie stands over him and SHOOTS him\nonce more.\n\nEDDIE\n(to Mr. Orange)\nYou were saying he went crazy?\nSomething like that?  Worse or\nbetter?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nLook, Eddie, he was pullin a burn.\nHe was gonna kill the cop and me.\nAnd when you guys walked through\nthe door, he was gonna blow you to\nhell and make off with the\ndiamonds.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(to Eddie)\nUhuh, uhuh, what's I tell ya?\nThat sick piece of shit was a\nstone cold psycho.\n\nMR. ORANGE\n(to Eddie)\nYou could've asked the cop, if you\ndidn't just kill him.  He talked\nabout what he was going to do when\nhe was slicing him up.\n\nEDDIE\nI don't buy it.  It doesn't make\nsense.\n\nMR. WHITE\nIt makes perfect fuckin sense to\nme.  Eddie, you didn't see how he\nacted during the job, we did.\n\nMr. Pink walks over to the cop's body.\n\nMR. PINK\nHe's right about the ear, it's\nhacked off.\n\nEDDIE\n(to Mr. Orange)\nLet me say this out loud, just to\nget it straight in my mind.\nAccording to you, Mr. Blonde was\ngonna kill you.  Then when we came\nback, kill us, grab the diamonds,\nand scram.  That's your story?\nI'm correct about that, right?\n\nMR. ORANGE\nEddie, you can believe me or not\nbelieve me, but it's the truth.  I\nswear on my mother's eternal soul\nthat's what happened.\n\nThe CAMERA mover into a C.U. of Nice Guy Eddie.\n\nThere's a long pause while he rolls over what Mr. Orange\nhas said.  Finally:\n\nEDDIE\nYou're a fuckin liar.  Now why\ndon't you drop the fuckin fairy\ntale and tell me what really\nhappened?\n\nMR. WHITE (OS)\nHe told you what really happened.\nYou just can't deal with it.\n\nMR. ORANGE (OS)\nOkay, you're right, I'm lying.\nEven though I'm fuckin dyin I'm\nnot above pullin a fast one.  Get\nrid of Blonde, we share his split\n- no, scratch that, I shot him\n'cause I didn't like his hair\nstyle.  I didn't like his shoes\neither.  If it has just been his\nhair, I'd've maybe, maybe I said,\nlet him live.  But hair and\nfootwear together, he's a goner.\n\nEDDIE\nThe man you killed was just\nreleased from prison.  He got\ncaught at a company warehouse full\nof hot items.  He could've walked\naway.  All he had to do was say my\ndad's name.  But instead he shut\nhis mouth and did his time.  He\ndid four years for us, and he did\n'em like a man.  And we were very\ngrateful.  So, Mr. Orange, you're\ntellin me this very good friend of\nmine, who did four years for my\nfather, who in four years never\nmade a deal, no matter what they\ndangled in front of him, you're\ntelling me that now, that now this\nman is free, and we're making good\non our commitment to him, he's\njust gonna decide, right out of\nthe fuckin blue, to rip us off?\n\nSilence.\n\nEDDIE\nMr. Orange, why don't you tell me\nwhat really happened?\n\nVOICE (OS)\nWhy?  It'll just be more bullshit.\n\nEddie steps out of his C.U. and we see Joe Cabot standing\nin the warehouse doorway.  He walks into the room.\n\nJOE\n(pointing to Mr.\nOrange)\nThis man set us up.\n\nCAMERA does a 360 around the men.\n\nEDDIE\nDaddy, I'm sorry, I don't know\nwhat's happening.\n\nJOE\nThat's okay, Eddie, I do.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(to Joe)\nWhat the fuck are you talking\nabout?\n\nJOE\n(pointing to Mr.\nOrange)\nThat piece of shit.  Workin with\nthe cops.\n\nMR. WHITE   MR. PINK   EDDIE\nWhat?\n\nJOE\nI said this lump of shit is workin\nwith the LAPD.\n\n\nMR. ORANGE'S POV\n\nLooking up from the floor at everybody.\n\nJoe looks down at Mr. Orange.\n\nJOE\nAren't you?\n\nMR. ORANGE (OS)\nI don't have the slightest fuckin\nidea what you're talkin about.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(very calmly to Joe)\nJoe, I don't know what you think\nyou know, but you're wrong.\n\nJOE\nLike hell I am.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(very calmly)\nJoe, trust me on this, you've made\na mistake.  He's a good kid. I\nunderstand you're hot, you're\nsuper-fuckin pissed.  We're all\nreal emotional.  But you're\nbarking up the wrong tree.  I know\nthis man, and he wouldn't do that.\n\nJOE\nYou don't know jack shit.  I do.\nThis rotten bastard tipped off the\ncops and got Mr. Brown and Mr.\nBlue killed.\n\nMR. PINK\nMr. Blue's dead?\n\nJOE\nDead as Dillinger.\n\nEDDIE\nThe motherfucker killed Vic.\n\nMR. WHITE\nHow do you know all this?\n\nJOE\nHe was the only one I wasn't a\nhundred percent on.  I should have\nmy fucking head examined for goin\nforward when I wasn't a hundred\npercent.  But he seemed like a\ngood kid, and I was impatient and\ngreedy and all the things that\nfuck you up.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(screaming)\nThat's your proof?\n\nJOE\nYou don't need proof when you got\ninstinct.  I ignored it before,\nbut not no more.\n\nHe WHIPS out a revolver and aims it at Mr. Orange.\n\nMr. White brings his .45 up at Joe.\n\nEddie and Mr. Pink are shook awake by the flash of\nfirearms.\n\nEddie raises his gun, pointing it at Mr. White.\n\nEDDIE\nHave you lost your fucking mind?\nPut your gun down!\n\nMr. Pink fades into the B.G., wanting no part of this.\n\nMR. WHITE\nJoe, you're making a terrible\nmistake I can't let you make.\n\nEDDIE\nStop pointing your fuckin gun at\ndaddy!\n\nJoe, never taking his eyes off Mr. Orange.\n\nJOE\nDon't worry, Eddie.  Me and Larry\nhave been friends a long time, he\nain't gonna shoot.  We like each\nother too much.\n\nMR. WHITE\nJoe, if you kill that man, you die\nnext.  Repeat, if you kill that\nman, you die next!\n\nWe get many different angles of the Mexican standoff.\n\n\nMEDIUMS ON EVERYBODY\n\nMr. Orange holding his belly, looking from left to right.\n\nJoe pointing down on Mr. Orange.  Not taking his eyes off\nhim.\n\nMr. White pointing at Joe, looking like he's ready to\nstart firing any minute.\n\nEddie scared shitless for his father, gun locked on Mr.\nWhite.\n\nMr. Pink walking backwards away from the action.\n\nNobody says nothing.\n\n\nFOUR SHOT\n\nof guys ready for violence.  Mr. Pink in the B.G.\n\nMR. PINK\nC'mon, guys, nobody wants this.\nWe're supposed to me fuckin\nprofessionals!\n\nJoe raises his head to Mr. White.\n\nJOE\nLarry, I'm gonna kill him.\n\nMR. WHITE\nGoddamn you, Joe, don't make me do\nthis!\n\nJOE\nLarry, I'm askin you to trust me\non this.\n\nMR. WHITE\nDon't ask me that.\n\nJOE\nI'm not askin, I'm betting.\n\nJoe's eyes go back to Mr. Orange.\n\nEDDIE\nDaddy, don't!\n\nJoe FIRES three times, HITTING Mr. Orange with every one.\n\nMr. White SHOOTS Joe twice in the face.  Joe brings his\nhands up to his face, screaming, and falls to the ground.\n\nEddie FIRES at Mr. White, HITTING him three times in the\nchest.\n\nMr. White brings his gun around on Eddie and SHOOTS him.\n\nThe two men FALL to their knees, FIRING at each other.\n\nEddie COLLAPSES, dead.\n\nJoe's dead.\n\nMr. Orange lies perfectly still, except for his chest\nheaving.  The only SOUND we hear is his loud breathing.\n\nMr. White is SHOT full of holes, but still on his knees,\nnot moving.\n\nMr. Pink is standing motionless.  Finally he grabs the\nsatchel of diamonds and RUNS out the door.\n\nWe hear outside a CAR START.  Then the SOUND of a BULLHORN\nyells out:\n\nPOLICE FORCE (OS)\nFreeze! Get out of the car and lie\nface down on the ground!\n\nMR. PINK (OS)\nDon't shoot!\n\nWe now hear SIRENS, the SOUNDS of more CARS DRIVING UP,\nMEN RUNNING to the warehouse.\n\nWhile all this noise is going on, Mr. White tries to stand\nbut FALLS DOWN.  He somehow makes it to where Mr. Orange\nlies.\n\nHe lifts Mr. Orange's head, cradling it in his lap and\nstroking his brow.\n\nMR. WHITE\n(with much effort)\nSorry, kid.  Looks like we're\ngonna do a little time.\n\nMr. Orange looks up at him and, with even more of an\neffort:\n\nMR. ORANGE\nI'm a cop.\n\nMr. White doesn't say anything, he keeps stroking Orange's\nbrow.\n\nMR. ORANGE\nI'm sorry, I'm so sorry.\n\nMr. White lifts his .45 and places the barrel between Mr.\nOrange's eyes.\n\nThe CAMERA MOVES into an EXTREME C.U. of Mr White.\n\nThe SOUNDS of outside STORM inside.  We don't see\nanything, but we HEAR a bunch of shotguns COCKING.\n\nPOLICE FORCE (OS)\nFreeze, motherfucker!  Drop your\nfucking gun!\n\nMr White looks up at them, smiles, PULLS the trigger.\n\nBANG\n\nWe hear a BURST of SHOTGUN FIRE.\n\nMr. White is BLOWN out of frame, leaving it empty.1Embed"}, {"_type":

You sussed it out, huh? [Sam closes the door.] Let me tell you something Sam, you're a smart guy. But if you can figure it out, and I can figure it out, what makes you think that no one in my Press Room can figure it out?\n\nSAM\nThere's nothing to figure out.\n\nC.J.\nYou can't spend time with a call girl, you're gonna get caught.\n\nSAM\nCaught doing what?\n\nC.J.\nDon't get cute with me.\n\nSAM\nYou are aware that I didn't know she was a call girl when I went home with her, right?\n\nC.J.\nBut you called her again and went back to see her.\n\nSAM\nI went back to see her, I didn't go back to solicit her.\n\nC.J.\nIt doesn't make a difference.\n\nSAM\nIt does make a difference.\n\nC.J.\nYou work in the White House, you work fifty feet from the Oval Office. And you're consorting with a...\n\nSAM\nConsorting? I'm friendly with a woman, I like this woman. This woman poses no threat to the President. And it's very likely that owing to my friendship, this woman may start living her life in bound, insuring for herself a greater future and\nisn't that exactly what we're supposed to be doing here?\n\nC.J.\nOh.\n\nSAM\nC.J.\n\nC.J.\nYou're there to make her see the error of her ways.\n\nSAM\nThis is ridiculous. I'm there because I like her. I'm there because it's there that I'd be if this were alcohol or drugs. I'm not sleeping with her, this isn't tawdry.\n\nC.J.\nI don't care what it is, I care what it looks like.\n\nSAM\nAnd I care what it is! And I think it's high time we all spend a little less time looking good, and a little more time...\n\nC.J.\nBeing good?\n\nSAM\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nYeah, I've heard that one before. And one other thing.\n\nSAM\nAre we done?\n\nC.J.\nNo, Sam, when I say there's 'one other thing' that means we're not done, that there's one other thing.\n\nSAM\nI'm resenting the hell out of this conversation.\n\nC.J.\nIt was tough to tell from your tone of voice.\n\nSAM\nWhat do you want?\n\nC.J.\nI beg your pardon?\n\nSAM\nWhat's the one other thing?\n\nC.J.\nI'm your first phone call.\n\nSAM\nWhen?\n\nC.J.\nBefore, now, in the future, anytime you're into something and you don't know what. And you can't tell me that you thought there was nothing to it, because you sat down with Josh and you sat down with Toby. Anytime you're into something and you don't know what, you don't keep it from me. I'm your first phone call. I'm your first line of defense. You have to let me protect you and you have to let me protect the President.\n\nSAM\nIs that what this is about?\n\nC.J.\n[stands] What this is about Sam is you're a high profile, very visible, much noticed member...\n\nSAM\nYou just said three things that all mean the same thing.\n\nC.J.\nYou're not going to let this out of your teeth.\n\nSAM\nCan I go now C.J.? Because what I think this is about is you. Once again letting the character cops win in a forfeit because you don't have the guts or the strength or the courage to say 'we know what's right from wrong and this none of your damn\nbusiness!'\n\nC.J.\n[taken aback] Really?\n\nSAM\nYes!\n\nC.J.\nStrength, guts or courage?\n\nSAM\nYes.\n\nC.J.\nYou just said three things that all mean the same thing. [sits]\n\nSAM\nC.J.\n\nC.J.\nWe're done talking now. You can go. [beat]\n\nSAM\n\nSAM\n[opens the door and starts to leave. C.J. starts typing on her laptop]\nAbout the retaliatory strike, do you think we're going to target--?\n\nC.J.\nI really don't know what we're going to target Sam. The commandant of the 2nd division doesn't tend to include me in his thinking.\n\nSAM\nI'll see you later.\n\nC.J.\nCount on it.\n\nSam exits into JOSH'S BULLPEN AREA. Sam walks down the hall and smashes his fist against a wall.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY\nThe National Security team and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral PERCY FITZWALLACE, sit around a table.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nYou know what I was thinking?\n\nOFFICER\nWhat's that, Admiral?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThis is different coffee than we usually have.\n\nThe doors open, Bartlet and Leo enter. Everyone stands.\n\nBARTLET\nKeep your seats. [Everyone sits back down.]\n\nFITZWALLACE\nGood morning Mr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat have we got?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThree retaliatory strike scenarios.\n\nLEO\nWhen are they operational?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nAt the President's command.\n\nLEO\nNo prep time?\n\nGENERAL\nWe're there.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nAll three scenarios are comprehensive, meet the obligations of proportional response and pose minimal threat to U.S. personal and assets. To turn our attention to scenario one, or Pericles One, to use its code name...\n\nBARTLET\nWhat is the virtue of a proportional response?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nI'm sorry.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's the virtue of a proportional response? Why's it good? [beat] They hit an airplane, so we hit a transmitter, right? That's a proportional response.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nSir, in the case of Pericles...\n\nBARTLET\nThey hit a barracks, so we hit two transmitters?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThat's roughly it, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nIt's what we do. I mean this is what we do.\n\nLEO\nYes sir, it's what we do, it's what we've always done.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, if it's what we do, if it's what we've always done, don't they know we're going to do it?\n\nLEO\nSir, if you would turn your attention to Pericles One.\n\nBARTLET\nI have turned my attention to Pericles One, it's two ammo dumps, an abandoned railroad bridge and a Syrian intelligence agency.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nThose are four high rated military targets, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nBut they know we're going to do that, they know we're going to do that. Those areas have been abandoned for four days. We know that from the satellites. We have the intelligence.\n\nLEO\nSir.\n\nBARTLET\nThey did that, so we did this, it's the cost of doing business, it's been factored in, right?\n\nLEO\nMr. President...\n\nBARTLET\nAm I right or am I missing something here?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nNo sir, you're right sir.\n\nBARTLET\nThen I ask again, what is the virtue of a proportional response?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nIt isn't virtuous Mr. President. It's all there is sir.\n\nBARTLET\nIt is not all there is.\n\nLEO\nSir, Admiral Fitzwallace...\n\nFITZWALLACE\nExcuse me Leo, but pardon me Mr. President, just what else is there?\n\nBARTLET\nA disproportional response. Let the word ring forth from this time and this place, you kill an American, any American, we don't come back with a proportional response, we come back [bangs fist on table] with total disaster!\n\nGENERAL\nAre you suggesting we carpet-bomb Damascus?\n\nBARTLET\nGeneral, I am suggesting that you and Admiral Fitzwallace and Secretary Hutchinson and the rest of the national security team take the next sixty minutes and put together a U.S. response scenario that doesn't make me think we are just docking somebody's damn allowance!

Donna and Josh are outside walking towards the room, you can hear faint echoes of banter.\n\nJOSH [OS]\nI haven't eaten lunch yet, if anyone's going to the thing.\n\nDONNA [OS]\nWhat do you want? [They appear in the doorway and walk in.]\n\nJOSH\nI would like a salad. I would like a soup of some kind and if you were to run across a sandwich, then hang the expense.\n\nDONNA\nRight.\n\nJOSH\nAnd I would like a bottle of water.\n\nDONNA\nThis is Charles Young. [hands him Charlie's file and leaves.]\n\nJOSH\nI'm supposed to vet you.\n\nCHARLIE\nI beg your pardon?\n\nJOSH\nI'm supposed to vet you, vet you; investigate to discover... if there are problems. I'm Josh Lyman, deputy chief of staff.\n\nCHARLIE\nHow are you?\n\nJOSH\nIs it Charles?\n\nCHARLIE\nCharlie.\n\nJOSH\nCharlie, you can have a seat if you like.\n\nCHARLIE\nI don't mind standing.\n\nDonna walks down the hall.\n\nJOSH\nUh, Donna!\n\nDONNA\n[appears in the doorway] What?\n\nJOSH\nNever mind the salad, I'm not going to eat it anyway.\n\nDONNA\nFine.\n\nJOSH\nBut I would like a bottle of water as soon as humanly possible.\n\nDONNA\nFine. [leaves]\n\nJOSH\nSo... have a seat. [Charlie does.] I'm sure you understand why we have to go through this. It's a very sensitive job. It's also a very hard job. Twenty-hour days aren't uncommon, long trips at the last minute, a lot of wait and hurry up. Moreover there will be times when you'll have to make yourself invisible in plain sight, as well as an undeniable force in front of those who want more time than we're willing to give. Sometimes the people I'm talking about will be kings and prime ministers, you understand so far?\n\nCHARLIE\nUh, sir, I'm sorry but I think there's been some sort of mistake.\n\nJOSH\nReally?\n\nCHARLIE\nSee, I came here, I filled out an application form...\n\nJOSH\nYeah, I have your paperwork.\n\nCHARLIE\nRight, see, I came here, I was looking for a job as a messenger and I had an interview with Miss DiLaguardia and she told me to wait.\n\nJOSH\nYes.\n\nCHARLIE\nAnd then she told me to come here.\n\nJOSH\nYes, that's because we asked Miss DiLaguardia to keep an eye out. She's recommending you for a different job.\n\nCHARLIE\nSir, if you don't mind me asking--\n\nJOSH\nPersonal aide to the President, and you don't have to call me 'Sir'.\n\nCHARLIE\nI don't understand.\n\nJOSH\nPersonal aide to the President, traditionally a young guy, 20 to 25 years old, excels academically, strong in personal responsibility and discretion, presentable appearance.\n\nCHARLIE\nSir--\n\nJOSH\nWe obviously get a lot of candidates that meet those qualifications, the rest is just gut instinct. [beat] Or you could bribe me.\n\nCHARLIE\nUh, um, sir...\n\nJOSH\nSeriously Charlie, we call the President 'Sir' everyone else is 'hey, when am I gonna get that thing I asked for?'\n\nDONNA\n[enters and hands Josh a bottle of water] Water.\n\nCHARLIE\nSee, that's not... see, there's been some kind of mistake.\n\nJOSH\n[reading a report] I'll say. Donna! [She stops at the door.]\n\nCHARLIE\nI should go. [stands]\n\nJOSH\n'Insuccessful'?\n\nDONNA\nWhat's the problem?\n\nJOSH\nI don't think we're allowed to make up our own words.\n\nDONNA\nOh, and like there's no chance it's a typo.\n\nJOSH\nChange it, would you? Serious people are going to read that. [Donna takes the report and exits.]\n\nJOSH\nCharlie, you're standing again.\n\nCHARLIE\nWell, see, I came here for a messenger job.\n\nJOSH\nWhy aren't you in college?\n\nCHARLIE\nWell, uh...\n\nJOSH\nThese transcripts. Your grades are better than mine.\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. Lyman.\n\nJOSH\nWell, no, not really, but they're close.\n\nCHARLIE\nIt was an easy school.\n\nJOSH\nNo, come one, I'm looking at recommendations from guidance counselors, I'm looking at ACT scores. You didn't want to go to college?\n\nCHARLIE\nWell, I have a little sister at home.\n\nJOSH\nYou take care of her?\n\nCHARLIE\nYes sir.\n\nJOSH\nYour parents are gone?\n\nCHARLIE\nMy mom, she's a police officer.

THE SITUATION ROOM - DAY\nBartlet walks in and sits down.\n\nBARTLET\nKeep your seats. There's a delegation of cardiologists having their pictures taken in the Blue Room. You wouldn't think you could find a group of people more arrogant than the fifteen of us, but there they are right upstairs in the Blue Room. You called me?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nYes, sir. Mr. President we put together a scenario by which we attack Hassan airport. Its three main terminals and two runway. In addition to the civilian causalities, which could register in the thousands, the strike would temporally cripple the region's ability to receive medical supplies and bottled water. I think Mr. Cashmen and Secretary Hutchinson would each tell you what I'm sure you already know sir. That this strike would be seen at home and abroad as a staggering overreaction by a first time Commander in Chief. That without the support of our allies, without a Western Coalition, without Great Britain and Japan and without Congress, you'll have doled out a five thousand dollar punishment for a fifty buck crime sir. Mr. President, the proportional response doesn't empty the options box for the future, the way an all out assault--\n\nBARTLET\n[waves him off] Thank you. [beat] Does anyone have a cigarette?\n\nAn officer pulls out a pack and a lighter and slides it towards the President. Bartlet pulls out a cigarette and lights it.\n\nBARTLET [cont.]\nThis other plan...\n\nFITZWALLACE\nPericles One.\n\nBARTLET\nPericles One. No civilian causalities?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nWe can't promise that.\n\nBARTLET\nBut you're as certain as you can be?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nYes sir.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd what are the military implications?\n\nOFFICER 2\nWe'll cripple both their intelligence network and their surface to air strike capabilities.\n\nBARTLET\nVery well. [pause, to Leo] How does this work?\n\nFITZWALLACE\nYou give me the go order sir.\n\nAn officer moves over to the phone. Bartlet sighs. Pause.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nMr. President? [Bartlet nods.] This is Fitzwallace, I have a go order from the President. Start the clock on Pericles One. Stand by for confirmation code.\n\nOFFICER\nWe're underway.\n\nBartlet throws his cigarette in a glass of water. He gets up and is standing in the doorway.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nWell done.\n\nBARTLET\nFifty buck crime. [to Leo] I honestly don't know what the hell we're doing here.\n[leaves]\n\nCUT TO: INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY\nCharlie and Josh are sitting at the table. Josh has a bunch of paperwork in front of him.\n\nJOSH\nCharlie, I've got some questions here for you from the Council's office, as well as the Department of the Treasury and the Office of Internal Security. These questions are all routine, there's no cause for concern. Ready?\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. Lyman--\n\nJOSH\n'Have you ever tried to overthrow the government?'\n\nCHARLIE\nIs it because the messenger job is not available anymore? Because maybe if I came back at a different time.\n\nJOSH\nCharlie, this job's actually better than the messenger job. It pays more, you don't have to ride around town on a bicycle and instead of being a messenger, you get to be personal aide to the President.\n\nCHARLIE\nI see. So, maybe if I come--\n\nSam knocks on the door and walks in.\n\nJOSH\nHey, Sam. This is Sam Seaborn, he's deputy communications director. This is Charlie Young. He's here for Ted's job.\n\nSAM\nIt's nice to meet you, don't get up.\n\nCHARLIE\nUm, I was here for the messenger job.\n\nSAM\nDebbie's got an eye for personnel.\n\nCHARLIE\nI've got a driver's license and my own bike so...\n\nJOSH\nI gotta ask you some more questions...\n\nSAM\nHave you ever tried to overthrow the government?\n\nCHARLIE\nNo sir.\n\nSAM\nWhat the hell's been stopping you? [Josh and Sam laugh.]\n\nJOSH\nSeriously Charlie, I have to ask you about your personal life.\n\nSAM\nNo, you don't.\n\nJOSH\nYes, I do.\n\nSAM\nWhy?\n\nJOSH\nBecause I do.\n\nSAM\nCharlie, are you gonna come to work early, stay late, do your job efficiently and discretely?\n\nCHARLIE\nAs I was saying to Mr. Lyman--\n\nSAM\nThank you. What more do you need to know?\n\nJOSH\nCharlie, I wonder if you could tell me about your social life, your friends, what you like to do?\n\nSAM\nJosh, I cannot believe you.\n\nCHARLIE\nWell, uh, there's my sister Deena and uh, I'm not sure what you're asking.\n\nSAM\nHe's asking if you're gay, Charlie, and I wouldn't answer the damn question.\n\nJOSH\nAll right, that's it Sam, let's take a walk.

Two munitions dumps in Northern Rishan, Southian bridge and an IHQ.\n\nC.J.\nWhat's the estimated time?\n\nLEO\nAbout 6:30 Eastern, you can come to the Sit Room in twenty minutes for a weapons briefing.

[beat] Margaret!\n\nJOSH\nHey Leo, can I ask you a question?\n\nLEO\nWhat?\n\nJOSH\nI'm interviewing this kid for Ted Miller's job, and he's a real special kid. He's applied himself in school, I'm sure he'd be articulate if he wasn't terrified. He's postponing college until his sister gets out of high school.\n\nLEO\nWhere are the parents?\n\nJOSH\nFather's long gone. His mother was a uniformed cop here in D.C.\n\nLEO\nWas?\n\nJOSH\nShe was shot and killed in the line five months ago. [beat] I really like him Leo.

A young black man holding his overnight bag?\n\nLEO\nJosh, I hold the door open for the President, it's an honor. This is serious business Josh. This isn't casting.

Tell him he's doing fine.\n\nLEO\nHe's not doing fine.\n\nFITZWALLACE\nYeah, he is. Presidents don't make new friends, that's why they gotta keep their old ones. You'll know what to say.

Josh looks around, whistles a little bit, and generally looks bored.\n\nJOSH\nI've got nothing to do.\n\nDONNA\nI can see that.\n\nA staffers runs up, grabs something from near where Josh is standing and runs off.\n\nJOSH\nWoo! Excuse me. Everyone's running around like the future of the world depends on it, which I suppose it does, everyone running around, working. Me, I've got nothing to do.\n\nDONNA\nYes.\n\nJOSH\nI'm like a writer on a movie set.\n\nDONNA\nHave you ever been on a movie set?\n\nJOSH\nNo, but I hear stories.\n\nDONNA\nYou wanna do mail?\n\nJOSH\n[sitting down] I suppose there's some comfort in knowing that whatever's going to happen today has already happened.\n\nMANDY [walks out of Josh's office]\nJosh, your office sucks.\n\nJOSH\nI don't understand it. Why can't you tell me when there's someone in my office?\n\nDONNA\nThe first time I didn't know, the second time I didn't care that much. [gets up and leaves]\n\nMANDY\nI mean it, it's a hole.\n\nJOSH\n[gets up and walks toward her and his office] Why are you here?\n\nMANDY\nI start work next week, I came to get psyched.\n\nJOSH'S OFFICE. They both enter.\n\nJOSH\nYou picked a really bad time to get psyched.\n\nMANDY\nBecause the President gave the attack order and you're getting ready to go on the air?\n\nJOSH\nNo, it's because--\n\nMANDY\nPlease Josh, everyone's running around looking casual, Toby and Sam are locked in with the speechwriters and you've got nothing to do. What is it? An IHQ and a couple of armories?\n\nJOSH\nYou wanna say it a bit louder Mandy, I don't Syrian Air Defense Command heard you.\n\nMANDY\nI brought you a present.\n\nJOSH\nWhy are you being nice to me? [sits behind his desk]\n\nMANDY\nCause I'm really psyched to get started at work.\n\nJOSH\nIt's been pretty bad around here since it happened.\n\nMANDY\nI had a hunch.\n\nJOSH\nThe combination of American lives and Morris, the idea of using any force at all.\n\nMANDY\nWe always said he'd be in his head.\n\nJOSH\nHe wasn't ready for it.\n\nMANDY\nHow do you get ready for it?\n\nJOSH\nWhat did you bring me?\n\nMANDY\nWhat?\n\nJOSH\nI want my present.\n\nMANDY\nYeah. [grabs something out of her bag and gives it to Josh] It's a picture I found.\n\nJOSH\nIt's a picture of you and me and someone's drawn all over my face with magic marker.\n\nMANDY\nThat was me.\n\nJOSH\nAh.\n\nMANDY\nDuring my period of hating you.\n\nJOSH\nWell, that could have been pretty much any time, couldn't it?\n\nMANDY\nSure. [starts walking around Josh's desk, towards him] This was taken the night we met. At that seafood place by the Democratic Leadership Conference.\n\nJOSH\nLook at that.\n\nMANDY\nYou couldn't stop staring at me.\n\nJOSH\nWell, you were wearing quite the ensemble that night Madeline.\n\nMANDY\n[sits on the edge of his desk] I don't think it was the wardrobe you were staring at there, Lucky. [Josh laughs.] You guys are doing okay, Josh.\n\nThe phone rings. Josh picks it up.\n\nJOSH\nYeah... yeah. [hangs up] They found a job for me.\n\nMANDY\nI'll see you next week.\n\nJOSH\nListen, you're not gonna be this nice to me when we're working together, right?\n\nMANDY\nNot a chance. [leaves]\n\nJOSH\nThat's what I thought. [puts the picture on his desk. Donna walks in.] Hey. What's up?\n\nDonna and Josh exit.\n\nCUT TO: INT. C.J.'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nDanny and C.J. are sitting across from each other at her desk.\n\nDANNY\nI obviously don't have enough for a story, but as a courtesy to you C.J. I just wanted to let you know I'm gonna be asking around.\n\nC.J.\nDanny, it's gonna be much ado about nothing.\n\nDANNY\nIt doesn't look that way.\n\nC.J.\nBut it is that way and I just got through telling you it's that way.\n\nDANNY\nC.J.\n\nC.J.\nSam knows the difference between right and wrong and so do you. Would it make my life easier if he wasn't friends with this woman? Absolutely. But Sam is a grown up and I don't get to choose his friends and your readers don't get to judge them. And I'll tell you what else, there's something commendable about Sam's behavior here, don't ask me what but there is, and I'm stickin' by him until the President orders me otherwise and I'm going to look very unfavorably on those who seek only to make us look like fools.\n\nDANNY\nWhoa. Down girl. I'll drop it.\n\nC.J.\nGood.\n\nDANNY\nI'll drop it.\n\nC.J.\nThank you.\n\nDANNY\nBut C.J. you better get D'ed up here. Because not everyone's a good guy and you're gonna start to get traction on something that not everyone's a fan of and they're gonna put a tail on Seaborn, if they haven't already. Remember, I found out about this somehow and I wasn't there.\n\nC.J.\nI don't supposed you'd tell me...\n\nDANNY\nNo way. My point is, they'll keep it in their pocket until the eve of something big. Bill signing, State of the Union, maybe the convention.\n\nThe phone rings. C.J. answers.\n\nC.J.\nYeah. I'll wait for him. [to Danny] Hang on, I'm gonna give you a ten minute head start on something.\n\nDANNY\nWhat for?\n\nC.J.\nFor being a good guy.\n\nDANNY\nWhat's the tip?\n\nC.J.\n[into phone] Yeah, thank you. [hangs up] We're out of Syrian air space.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\nJosh is giving Charlie the tour. They're walking towards the Oval Office.\n\nJOSH\nThis used to be the White House Council's office 'til Toby and the Communications staff conquered and pillaged. The Map Room. Roosevelt Room. Oval Office. Chief of Staff. I guess the only thing left to do is to say hello to the President.\n\nCharlie stops walking.\n\nJOSH\nWe're going on the air in a few minutes with a national address so I don't know how much... where the hell'd he go? [beat] Charlie.\n\nJosh motions for Charlie to come into the Oval Office.\n\nCUT TO: INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT\nBartlet, Toby and Sam all walk in the room towards the desk. Staffers are still walking around frantically, they are joined by a crew of cameramen, gaffers, and stage managers. There are television monitors in the room and extra lights.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat happened to paragraph nine?\n\nSAM\nIn the red line sir.\n\nBARTLET\nI'm sorry, paragraph eight.\n\nSAM\nWe cut that half an hour ago.\n\nTOBY\nYou have to read between the lines.\n\nBARTLET\nWell, I want to see it again.\n\nTOBY\nYou should look at the new paragraph.\n\nBARTLET\nI can't look at anything fellas. Mrs. Landingham! I need my glasses!\n\nNANCY\nSir, she's talking to the porters right now.\n\nTOBY\nMr. President.\n\nBARTLET\nWhen do we get the BDA?\n\nTOBY\nUh.\n\nSAM\nThere's a problem with that sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy!?\n\nTOBY\nOrdinarily we get help from inside the Syrian Intelligence.\n\nJosh and Charlie enter.\n\nBARTLET\nSo what's the problem?\n\nTOBY\nWe just blew up the Syrian Intelligence.\n\nBARTLET\nOh, for crying out loud, will somebody get on the phone to CNN and find out if we hit anything!\n\nSTAFFER\nMr. President, it's the BDA sir. [hands Bartlet a report]\n\nBARTLET\nThank you! Now if I had my glasses.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\n[enters with Nancy] The porters have searched your bedroom from top to bottom.\n\nBARTLET\nThis has been since this morning, we could have brought in an optometrist by now.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\nAn optometrist can't fold his equipment into a briefcase.\n\nNANCY\nThey have those machines with the lenses.\n\nBARTLET\nI don't need an optometrist now, thank you Nancy. I just need to glasses he prescribed.\n\nC.J.\n[enters] Mr. President, if you'll take a minute or two to familiarize yourself with the phoenix.\n\nBARTLET\nI got the briefing on the phoenix.\n\nC.J.\nYou understand that I'm not talking about the sidewinder.\n\nBARTLET\nThe phoenix. I got the briefing on the phoenix last night, I studied the report, Hutchinson was there, in my private study.\n\nCharlie whispers something to Josh, who are farther away from all the action.\n\nBARTLET [cont.]\nThe phoenix, the A61, the sparrow, and the sidewinder. Are we covered?\n\nC.J.\nYes, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nVery well.\n\nDIRECTOR\nTen minutes to air Mr. President.\n\nJOSH\nTell him.\n\nBARTLET\nFor want of a pair of glasses.\n\nC.J.\nTry mine sir.\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\n[outside] We're looking.\n\nNANCY\n[also outside] She's looking.\n\nBARTLET\nThank you. [tries on C.J.'s glasses]\n\nTOBY\nWhile they're looking sir, in the meantime can you take a look at the new paragraph?\n\nBARTLET\nAw, crap. I can't see anything with those.\n\nJOSH\nCharlie, tell him.\n\nCHARLIE\nMr. President... [Everyone stops to look.] You said you read the phoenix report...\n\nBARTLET\nWhat!?\n\nCHARLIE\nYou said you read the phoenix report in your private study last night, sir.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat of it? Who is this?\n\nMRS. LANDINGHAM\n[to Nancy] Have a steward go the President's study. Have him look under the papers on the coffee table. [Nancy nods and exits.]\n\nJOSH\nMr. President, this is Charles Young...\n\nBARTLET\nI don't have anytime for new people now!\n\nLEO\nAlright, that's it. [beat] Excuse me, Mr. President, a minute please.\n\nCharlie walks out of the room. Bartlet and Leo head towards Leo's office. Toby flashes Leo a ten-minute sign with his hands. Leo nods.\n\nCUT TO: INT. LEO's OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nLeo walks around and closes all the doors while he's talking.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat do you need, Leo?\n\nLEO\nWell, you've gone through everyone who works for you and everyone who's married to you. I didn't know who else you could get mad at, so I was afraid the American people might be next. Oh, by the way, when we're done here you're sending\nAbby some flowers.\n\nBARTLET\n[pause] Did you know that two thousand years ago a Roman citizen could walk across the face of the known world free of the fear of molestation? He could walk across the earth unharmed, cloaked only in the words 'Civis Romanis' I am a Roman citizen. So great was the retribution of Rome, universally understood as certain, should any harm befall even one of its citizens. Where was Morris' protection, or anyone else on that plane? Where is the retribution for the families and where is the warning to the rest of the world that Americans shall walk this earth unharmed, lest the\nclenched fist of the most mighty military force in the history of mankind comes crashing down on your house!? In other words, Leo, what the hell are we doing here?\n\nLEO\nWe are behaving the way a superpower ought to behave.\n\nBARTLET\nWell our behavior has produced some pretty crappy results. In fact, I'm not a hundred percent sure it hasn't induced them.\n\nLEO\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nBARTLET\nI'm talking about two hundred and eight-six American marines in Beirut, I'm talking about Somalia, I'm talking about Nairobi.\n\nLEO\nAnd you think ratching up the body count's gonna act as a deterrent?\n\nBARTLET\nYou're damn right.\n\nLEO\nThen you are just as dumb as these guys who think that capital punishment is going to be a deterrent for drug kingpins. As if drug kingpins didn't live their day to day lives under the possibility of execution. And their executions are a lot less dainty than ours and tend to take place without the bother and expense of due process. So my friend, if you want to start using American military strength as the arm of the Lord, you can do that, we're the only superpower left. You can conquer the world, like Charlemange, but you better be prepared to kill everyone and you better start with me cause I will raise up an army against you and I will beat you!\n\nBARTLET\nHe had a ten-day-old baby at home.\n\nLEO\nI know.\n\nBARTLET\nWe are doing nothing. They dest...\n\nLEO\nWe are not doing nothing. Four high rated military targets.\n\nBARTLET\nAnd this is good?\n\nLEO\nOf course it's not good, there is no good. It's what there is. It's how you behave if you're the most powerful nation in the world. It's proportional, it's reasonable, it's responsible, it's merciful. It's not nothing, four high rated military targets.\n\nBARTLET\nWhich they'll rebuild again in six months.\n\nLEO\nSo we'll blow 'em up again in six months! We're getting really good at it. [beat]\nIt's what our fathers taught us.\n\nBARTLET\nWhy didn't you say so? [beat] Oh man Leo. When I think of all the work you put in to get me to run. [both sit] When I think of all the work you did to get me elected. I could pommel your ass with a baseball bat.\n\nThey laugh.\n\nLEO\nOh, here's one you'll like. Bertram Coles--\n\nBARTLET\nOh, I like anything that starts with 'Bertram Coles'. Let's have it.\n\nLEO\nColes goes on the radio yesterday and he says people in his district love America and you better not come down there cause you might not get out alive. [laughs]\n\nBARTLET\nBert's calling me out?\n\nLEO\nApparently, the people in Bert's district are so patriotic that if the President of the United States himself were to show up, they'd kill him.\n\nThey both laugh.\n\nBARTLET\nZiegler must be ballistic.\n\nLEO\nToby is on it.\n\nBARTLET\nOh, by the way, who was that kid before? The one who figured out where my glasses are?\n\nLEO\nWell, if you want him, that's your new body man.\n\nBARTLET\nWhat's his story?\n\nCUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT\nOutside the Oval Office, Charlie stands in the hall. Josh walks out to meet him.\n\nJOSH\nThis was just, I think, a bad day. I have to tell you, he's ordinarily an extremely kind man placing a very high premium on civility. Today, it's just been a difficult few days for him.\n\nCHARLIE\nI think I should probably go.\n\nBARTLET\n[appears in the doorway] Excuse me Charlie. Can I see you inside please? Come on, it's okay.\n\nCharlie, Bartlet and Josh all enter THE OVAL OFFICE.\n\nBARTLET [CONT]\nI'm Jed Bartlet.\n\nCHARLIE\nI'm Charles Young.\n\nBARTLET\nBut you prefer Charlie, right? Listen, Leo McGarry filled me in on the situation with your mother, I'm so very sorry. I hope you don't mind but I took the liberty of calling Tom Connolly, the FBI Director. We had the computer spit out some quick information, you're mother was killed by a Western .38 Revolver firing K.T.W.s, or what are known as 'Cop Killer bullets', now we have not had a whole lot of success banning that weapon and those bullets off the streets, but we're planning on taking a big whack at it when Congress gets back from recess. So, what do you say, you wanna come help us out?\n\nCHARLIE\nYes sir, I do.\n\nBARTLET\nThanks.\n\nBartlet and Charlie shake hands.\n\nDIRECTOR\nThirty seconds please!\n\nLEO\nAll set?\n\nBartlet is standing in front of his desk, Leo in front of it. Everyone else is behind the camera and monitors.\n\nBARTLET\nYou tell me.\n\nLEO\nThat's a pretty ugly tie.\n\nBARTLET\nMy granddaughter gave me this tie.\n\nLEO\nSo, my nephew gave me an ashtray he made at summer camp.\n\nBARTLET\nGet away from me. Somebody throw this guy out of the building!\n\nDIRECTOR\nStand by.\n\nBartlet sits. Leo moves back with the rest. Charlie and the senior staff are standing around one monitor.\n\nCHARLIE\nI've never felt like this before.\n\nJOSH\nIt doesn't go away.\n\nNEWSCASTER\n[on monitor] Here now, the President.\n\nBARTLET\nMy fellow Americans, good evening. A short while ago I ordered our Armed Forces to attack and destroy four military targets in Northern Syria, this in response to the unwarranted, unprovoked...\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\nEND TITLES.\n\nBARTLET [cont.]\n...and cold-blooded downing three days ago of an unarmed Air Force jet carrying 58 passengers and the flag of the United States.\n\nFADE TO BLACK.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1361258", "artist_names": "Nat \"King\" Cole", "full_title": "I Must Be Dreaming by\u00a0Nat\u00a0\"King\" Cole", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e118c4ea8eee279444bbf73c8d301501.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e118c4ea8eee279444bbf73c8d301501.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 1361258, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429781238, "path": "/Nat-king-cole-i-must-be-dreaming-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Nat-king-cole-i-must-be-dreaming-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e118c4ea8eee279444bbf73c8d301501.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e118c4ea8eee279444bbf73c8d301501.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "I Must Be Dreaming", "title_with_featured": "I Must Be Dreaming", "updated_by_human_at": 1655960943, "url": "https://genius.com/Nat-king-cole-i-must-be-dreaming-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/32622", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e605b4bd368059b58b3f1b7e34cfcc51.904x944x1.jpg", "id": 32622, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e605b4bd368059b58b3f1b7e34cfcc51.904x944x1.jpg", "index_character": "n", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole", "slug": "Nat-king-cole", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Nat-king-cole"}, "artist": "Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole", "lyrics": "I Must Be Dreaming LyricsI must be dreaming\nI must be dreaming\nI must be dreaming\nI must be because\n\nYou say you love me\nYou say you want me\nYou say you need me\nAnd I can't believe that\n\nSomeone as wonderful as you\nCould change my luck\nAnd make my dreams come true\nI must be dreaming\nBut if I'm dreaming\nI'll go on dreaming\nThe rest of my life\nDreaming of you\n\nI must be dreaming\nBut if I'm dreaming\nI'll go on dreaming\nThe rest of my life\nDreaming of youYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/8176969", "artist_names": "SiriusXM", "full_title": "Top 1000 Country Songs of All Time (2022) by\u00a0SiriusXM", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.512x512x1.jpg", "id": 8176969, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 16851497, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1658536633, "path": "/Siriusxm-top-1000-country-songs-of-all-time-2022-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Siriusxm-top-1000-country-songs-of-all-time-2022-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2022, "month": 7, "day": 8}, "release_date_for_display": "July 8, 2022", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jul. 8, 2022", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.512x512x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 6888}, "title": "Top 1000 Country Songs of All Time (2022)", "title_with_featured": "Top 1000 Country Songs of All Time (2022)", "updated_by_human_at": 1658687357, "url": "https://genius.com/Siriusxm-top-1000-country-songs-of-all-time-2022-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/200944", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.512x512x1.jpg", "id": 200944, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d238c1f9d7c4608628dd6b0db837c615.512x512x1.jpg", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "SiriusXM", "slug": "Siriusxm", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Siriusxm"}, "artist": "SiriusXM", "lyrics": "Top 1000 Country Songs of All Time (2022) Lyrics1000.

Rowling", "lyrics": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone: (Ch. 7) The Sorting Hat LyricsThe door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone to cross.\n\"The firs' years, Professor McGonagall,\" said Hagrid.\n\"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.\"\nShe pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys' house in it. The stone walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floors.\nThey followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right -the rest of the school must already be here -- but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.\n\"Welcome to Hogwarts,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.\n\"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.\n\"The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting.\"\nHer eyes lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried to flatten his hair.\n\"I shall return when we are ready for you,\" said Professor McGonagall. \"Please wait quietly.\"\nShe left the chamber. Harry swallowed.\n\"How exactly do they sort us into houses?\" he asked Ron.\n\"Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.\"\nHarry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn't know any magic yet -- what on earth would he have to do? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.\nThen something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air -- several people behind him screamed.\n\"What the --?\"\nHe gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little monk was saying: \"Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance --\"\n\"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost -- I say, what are you all doing here?\"\nA ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.\nNobody answered.\n\"New students!\" said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. \"About to be Sorted, I suppose?\"\nA few people nodded mutely.\n\"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!\" said the Friar. \"My old house, you know.\"\n\"Move along now,\" said a sharp voice. \"The Sorting Ceremony's about to start.\"\nProfessor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.\n\"Now, form a line,\" Professor McGonagall told the first years, \"and follow me.\"\nFeeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.\nHarry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard\nHermione whisper, \"Its bewitched to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.\"\nIt was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn't simply open on to the heavens.\nHarry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it in the house.\nMaybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing -- noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth -- and the hat began to sing:\n\"Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,\nBut don't judge on what you see,\nI'll eat myself if you can find\nA smarter hat than me.\nYou can keep your bowlers black,\nYour top hats sleek and tall,\nFor I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat\nAnd I can cap them all.\nThere's nothing hidden in your head\nThe Sorting Hat can't see,\nSo try me on and I will tell you\nWhere you ought to be.\nYou might belong in Gryffindor,\nWhere dwell the brave at heart,\nTheir daring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart;\nYou might belong in Hufflepuff,\nWhere they are just and loyal,\nThose patient Hufflepuffis are true And unafraid of toil;\nOr yet in wise old Ravenclaw,\nif you've a ready mind,\nWhere those of wit and learning,\nWill always find their kind;\nOr perhaps in Slytherin\nYou'll make your real friends,\nThose cunning folk use any means\nTo achieve their ends.\nSo put me on! Don't be afraid!\nAnd don't get in a flap!\nYou're in safe hands (though I have none)\nFor I'm a Thinking Cap!\"\nThe whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.\n\"So we've just got to try on the hat!\" Ron whispered to Harry. \"I'll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.\"\nHarry. smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather alot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy, that would have been the one for him.\nProfessor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.\n\"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,\" she said. \"Abbott, Hannah!\"\nA pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moments pause --\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat.\nThe table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.\n\"Bones, Susan!\"\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\" shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.\n\"Boot, Terry!\"\n\"RAVENCLAW!\"\nThe table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.\n\" Brocklehurst, Mandy\" went to Ravenclaw too, but \"Brown, Lavender\" became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.\n\"Bulstrode, Millicent\" then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.\n\"Finch-Fletchley, Justin!\"\n\"HUFFLEPUFF!\"\nSometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the house at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. \"Finnigan, Seamus,\" the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.\n\"Granger, Hermione!\"\nHermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.\n\"GRYFFINDOR!\" shouted the hat. Ron groaned.\nA horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he'd better get back on the train?\nWhen Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR,\" Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to \"MacDougal, Morag.\"\nMalfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, \"SLYTHERIN!\"\nMalfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.\nThere weren't many people left now. \"Moon\" \"Nott\" \"Parkinson\" then a pair of twin girls, \"Patil\" and \"Patil\" then \"Perks, Sally-Anne\" and then, at last -- \"Potter, Harry!\"\nAs Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.\n\"Potter, did she say?\"\nThe Harry Potter?\"\nThe last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.\nHmm,\" said a small voice in his ear. \"Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, A my goodness, yes -- and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that's interesting.... So where shall I put you?\"\nHarry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.\n\"Not Slytherin, eh?\" said the small voice. \"Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, if you're sure -- better be GRYFFINDOR!\"\nHarry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, \"We got Potter! We got Potter!\" Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he'd seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.\nHe could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he'd gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore's silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.\nAnd now there were only three people left to be sorted. \"Thomas, Dean,\" a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. \"Turpin, Lisa,\" became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, \"GRYFFINDOR!\"\nHarry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.\n\"Well done, Ron, excellent,\" said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry as \"Zabini, Blaise,\" was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.\nHarry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.\nAlbus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.\n\"Welcome,\" he said. \"Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!\n\"Thank you!\"\nHe sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether to laugh or not.\n\"Is he -- a bit mad?\" he asked Percy uncertainly.\n\"Mad?\" said Percy airily. \"He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?\"\nHarry's mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.\nThe Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.\n\"That does look good,\" said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak,\n\"Can't you --?\"\nI haven't eaten for nearly four hundred years,\" said the ghost. \"I don't need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've in troduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.\"\n\"I know who you are!\" said Ron suddenly. \"My brothers told me about you -- you're Nearly Headless Nick!\"\n\"I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy --\" the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.\n\"Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?\"\nSir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn't going at all the way he wanted.\n\"Like this,\" he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, \"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope you're going to help us win the house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghost.\"\nHarry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn't look too pleased with the seating arrangements.\n\"How did he get covered in blood?\" asked Seamus with great interest.\n\"I've never asked,\" said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.\nWhen everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding -- \"\nAs Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.\n\"I'm half-and-half,\" said Seamus. \"Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was a witch 'til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.\"\nThe others laughed.\n\"What about you, Neville?\" said Ron.\n\"Well, my gran brought me up and she's a witch,\" said Neville, \"but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.\"\nOn Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (\"I do hope they start right away, there's so much to learn, I'm particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it's supposed to be very difficult-\"; \"You'll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- \").\nHarry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at\nthe High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.\nIt happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight into Harry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry's forehead.\n\"Ouch!\" Harry clapped a hand to his head.\n\"What is it?\" asked Percy.\n\"N-nothing.\"\nThe pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teacher's look -- a feeling that he didn't like Harry at all.\n\"Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?\" he asked Percy.\n\"Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to -- everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.\"\nHarry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn't look at him again.\nAt last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.\n\"Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.\n\"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.\"\nDumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.\n\"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.\n\"Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.\n\"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.\"\nHarry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.\n\"He's not serious?\" he muttered to Percy.\n\"Must be,\" said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. \"It's odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we're not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest's full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.\"\n\"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!\" cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.\nDumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.\n\"Everyone pick their favorite tune,\" said Dumbledore, \"and off we go!\" And the school bellowed:\n\"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,\nTeach us something please,\nWhether we be old and bald\nOr young with scabby knees,\nOur heads could do with filling\nWith some interesting stuff,\nFor now they're bare and full of air,\nDead flies and bits of fluff,\nSo teach us things worth knowing,\nBring back what we've forgot,\njust do your best, we'll do the rest,\nAnd learn until our brains all rot.\nEverybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.\n\"Ah, music,\" he said, wiping his eyes. \"A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!\"\nThe Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.\nA bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.\n\"Peeves,\" Percy whispered to the first years. \"A poltergeist.\" He raised his voice, \"Peeves -- show yourself\"\nA loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.\n\"Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?\"\nThere was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross- legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.\n\"Oooooooh!\" he said, with an evil cackle. \"Ickle Firsties! What fun!\"\nHe swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.\n\"Go away, Peeves, or the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it!\" barked Percy.\nPeeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.\n\"You want to watch out for Peeves,\" said Percy, as they set off again. \"The Bloody Baron's the only one who can control him, he won't even listen to us prefects. Here we are.\"\nAt the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.\n\"Password?\" she said. \"Caput Draconis,\" said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it -- Neville needed a leg up -- and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.\nPercy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase -- they were obviously in one of the towers -- they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.\n\" Great food, isn't it?\" Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. \"Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets.\"\nHarry was going to ask Ron if he'd had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.\nPerhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn't want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully -- and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it -then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold -- there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.\nHe rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember the dream at all.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/5667927", "artist_names": "JKGenius75", "full_title": "Pro Wrestling Nicknames by\u00a0JKGenius75", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/0425a152b8a24420a4732cbc55766eaa.100x100x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0425a152b8a24420a4732cbc55766eaa.100x100x1.jpg", "id": 5667927, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 3807492, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1594610527, "path": "/Jkgenius75-pro-wrestling-nicknames-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Jkgenius75-pro-wrestling-nicknames-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2020, "month": 6, "day": 13}, "release_date_for_display": "June 13, 2020", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jun. 13, 2020", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/0425a152b8a24420a4732cbc55766eaa.100x100x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0425a152b8a24420a4732cbc55766eaa.100x100x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Pro Wrestling Nicknames", "title_with_featured": "Pro Wrestling Nicknames", "updated_by_human_at": 1667024140, "url": "https://genius.com/Jkgenius75-pro-wrestling-nicknames-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/1753679", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/10ea2ab0c8abbd3f034504bc76cffbac.100x100x1.jpg", "id": 1753679, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/10ea2ab0c8abbd3f034504bc76cffbac.100x100x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "JKGenius75", "slug": "Jkgenius75", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Jkgenius75", "iq": 344817}, "artist": "JKGenius75", "lyrics": "Pro Wrestling Nicknames LyricsThe 8-Bit Luchador (Player Uno)\n\nThe 8th Wonder of the World (Andre the Giant)\n\nThe 9th Wonder\u2005of\u2005the World (Chyna)\n\nA-List\u2005(David Otunga)\n\nAbove Average (Mike Sanders)\n\nThe Ace\u2005in the Hole (Sonny Siaki)\nAce of Hearts (Shane Valentine)\n\nAddicted to Love (Rhett Titus)\n\nThe AK-47 (Allysin Kay)\n\nThe Alaskan Assassin (Ice)\n\nThe All-American (Ron Simmons, Doug Basham, Jeff Peterson, Steve Rivers)\n\nThe All-American American (Jack Swagger)\n\nThe All-American Boy (Bob Backlund)\n\nThe Alpha Male (Monty Brown)\n\nAlushe the one made of felt, The Mayan Goblin (Alushe)\n\nThe Ambling Alp (Primo Carnera)\n\nAmerica's Hardcore Icon (G.I.

in my knees\nWhen she looked at me and sweetly smiled\nThere she is again\nStanding over by the record machine\nLookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine\nShe's too cute to be a minute over seventeen\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMeanwhile I was thinking...\nWell if she's in the mood\nNo need to break it\nI got the chance, and I oughta take it\nIf she'll dance, then we can make it\nCome on queenie, let's shake it\n[Chorus]\nGo, go, go, little queenie\nGo, go, go, little queenie\nGo, go, go, little queenie\n\n[Verse 2]\nTell me, who's the queen\nStanding over by the record machine\nLookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine\nShe's too cute to be a minute over seventeen\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMeanwhile, I was still thinkin ...\nIf it's a slow song, we'll omit it\nIf it's a rocker, that'll get it\nAnd if it's good, she'll admit it\nC'mon queenie, let's get with it\n\n[Chorus]\nGo, go, go, little queenie\nGo, go, go, little queenie\nGo, go, go, little queenie\n\n[Electric Guitar Outro]You

Your Murray refers it all to the latest of these;\u2014I forget when, and do not care;\u2014in which the largest flanking columns, and the entire effective mass of the walls, with their riband mosaics and high pediment, were built in front of, and above, what the barbarian renaissance designer chose to leave of the pure old Dominican church. You may see his ungainly jointings at the pedestals of the great columns, running through the pretty, parti-coloured base, which, with the 'Strait' Gothic doors, and the entire lines of the fronting and flanking tombs (where not restored by the Devil-begotten brood of modern Florence), is of pure, and exquisitely severe and refined, fourteenth century Gothic, with superbly carved bearings on its shields. The small detached line of tombs on the left, untouched in its sweet colour and living weed ornament, I would fain have painted, stone by stone: but one can never draw in front of a church in these republican days; for all the blackguard children of the neighbourhood come to howl, and throw stones, on the steps, and the ball or stone play against these sculptured tombs, as a dead wall adapted for that purpose only, is incessant in the fine days when I could have worked.\n\nIf you enter by the door most to the left, or north, and turn immediately to the right, on the interior of the wall of the fa\u00e7ade is an Annunciation, visible enough because well preserved, though in the dark, and extremely pretty in its way,\u2014of the decorated and ornamental school following Giotto:\u2014I can't guess by whom, nor does it much matter; but it is well To look at it by way of contrast with the delicate, intense, slightly decorated design of Memmi,\u2014in which, when you return into the Spanish chapel, you will feel the dependence for its effect on broad masses of white and pale amber, where the decorative school would have had mosaic of red, blue, and gold.\n\nOur first business this morning must be to read and understand the writing on the book held open by St. Thomas Aquinas, for that informs us of the meaning of the whole picture.\n\nIt is this text from the Book of Wisdom VII. 6.\n \"Optavi, et datus est mihi sensus.\nInvocavi, et venit in me Spiritus Sapientiae,\nEt preposui illam regnis et sedibus.\"\n\"I willed, and Sense was given me.\nI prayed, and the Spirit of Wisdom came upon me.\nAnd I set her before, (preferred her to,) kingdoms\nand thrones.\"\n\nThe common translation in our English Apocrypha loses the entire meaning of this passage, which\u2014not only as the statement of the experience of Florence in her own education, but as universally descriptive of the process of all noble education whatever\u2014we had better take pains to understand.\n\nFirst, says Florence \"I willed, (in sense of resolutely desiring,) and Sense was given me.\" You must begin your education with the distinct resolution to know what is true, and choice of the strait and rough road to such knowledge. This choice is offered to every youth and maid at some moment of their life;\u2014choice between the easy downward road, so broad that we can dance down it in companies, and the steep narrow way, which we must enter alone. Then, and for many a day afterwards, they need that form of persistent Option, and Will: but day by day, the 'Sense' of the rightness of what they have done, deepens on them, not in consequence of the effort, but by gift granted in reward of it. And the Sense of difference between right and wrong, and between beautiful and unbeautiful things, is confirmed in the heroic, and fulfilled in the industrious, soul.\n\nThat is the process of education in the earthly sciences, and the morality connected with them. Reward given to faithful Volition.\nNext, when Moral and Physical senses are perfect, comes the desire for education in the higher world, where the senses are no more our Teachers; but the Maker of the senses. And that teaching, we cannot get by labour, but only by petition.\n\n\"Invocavi, et venit in me Spiritus Sapientiae\"\u2014\"I prayed, and the Spirit of Wisdom,\"  (not, you observe, was given, [Footnote: I in careless error, wrote \"was given\" in 'Fors Clavigera.] but,) \"came upon me.\" The personal power of Wisdom: the \"[Greek: sophia]\"  or Santa Sophia, to whom the first great Christian temple was dedicated. This higher wisdom, governing by her presence, all earthly conduct, and by her teaching, all earthly art, Florence tells you, she obtained only by prayer.\n\nAnd these two Earthly and Divine sciences are expressed beneath in the symbols of their divided powers;\u2014Seven terrestrial, Seven celestial, whose names have been already indicated to you:\u2014in which figures I must point out one or two technical matters, before touching their interpretation. They are all by Simon Memmi originally; but repainted, many of them all over, some hundred years later,\u2014(certainly after the discovery of America, as you will see)\u2014by an artist of considerable power, and some feeling for the general action of the figures; but of no refinement or carelessness. He dashes massive paint in huge spaces over the subtle old work, puts in his own chiaro-oscuro where all had been shadeless, and his own violent colour where all had been pale, and repaints the faces so as to make them, to his notion, prettier and more human: some of this upper work has, however, come away since, and the original outline, at least, is traceable; while in the face of the Logic, the Music, and one or two others, the original work is very pure. Being most interested myself in the earthly sciences, I had a scaffolding put up, made on a level with them, and examined them inch by inch, and the following report will be found accurate until next repainting.\n\nFor interpretation of them, you must always take the central figure of the Science, with the little medallion above it, and the figure below, all together. Which I proceed to do, reading first from left to right for the earthly sciences, and then from right to left the heavenly ones, to the centre, where their two highest powers sit, side by side.\n\nWe begin, then, with the first in the list given above, (Vaulted Book, page 75):\u2014Grammar, in the corner farthest from the window.\n\n1. GRAMMAR: more properly Grammatic\u00eb, \"Grammatic Act\" the Art of Letters or \"Literature,\" or using the word which to some English ears will carry most weight with it,\u2014\"Scripture,\"  and its use. The Art of faithfully reading what has been written for our learning; and of clearly writing what we would make immortal of our thoughts. Power which consists first in recognizing letters; secondly, in forming them; thirdly, in the understanding and choice of words which errorless shall express our thought. Severe exercises all, reaching\u2014very few living persons know, how far: beginning properly in childhood, then only to be truly acquired. It is wholly impossible\u2014this I say from too sorrowful experience\u2014to conquer by any effort or time, habits of the hand (much more of head and soul) with which the vase of flesh has been formed and filled in youth,\u2014the law of God being that parents shall compel the child in the day of its obedience into habits of hand, and eye, and soul, which, when it is old, shall not, by any strength, or any weakness, be departed from.\n\"Enter ye in,\"  therefore, says Grammatic\u00eb, \"at the Strait Gate.\" She points through it with her rod, holding a fruit(?) for reward, in her left hand. The gate is very strait indeed\u2014her own waist no less so, her hair fastened close. She had once a white veil binding it, which is lost. Not a gushing form of literature, this,\u2014or in any wise disposed to subscribe to Mudie's, my English friends\u2014or even patronize Tauchnitz editions of\u2014what is the last new novel you see ticketed up today in Mr. Goodban's window? She looks kindly down, nevertheless, to the three children whom she is teaching\u2014two boys and a girl: (Qy. Does this mean that one girl out of every two should not be able to read or write? I am quite willing to accept that inference, for my own part,\u2014should perhaps even say, two girls out of three). This girl is of the highest classes, crowned, her golden hair falling behind her the Florentine girdle round her hips\u2014(not waist, the object being to leave the lungs full play; but to keep the dress always well down in dancing or running). The boys are of good birth also, the nearest one with luxuriant curly hair\u2014only the profile of the farther one seen. All reverent and eager. Above, the medallion is of a figure looking at a fountain. Underneath, Lord Lindsay says, Priscian, and is, I doubt not, right.\n\nTechnical Points.\u2014The figure is said by Crowe to be entirely repainted. The dress is so throughout\u2014both the hands also, and the fruit, and rod. But the eyes, mouth, hair above the forehead, and outline of the rest, with the faded veil, and happily, the traces left of the children, are genuine; the strait gate perfectly so, in the colour underneath, though reinforced; and the action of the entire figure is well preserved: but there is a curious question about both the rod and fruit. Seen close, the former perfectly assumes the shape of folds of dress gathered up over the raised right arm, and I am not absolutely sure that the restorer has not mistaken the folds\u2014at the same time changing a pen or style into a rod. The fruit also I have doubts of, as fruit is not so rare at Florence that it should be made a reward. It is entirely and roughly repainted, and is oval in shape. In Giotto's Charity, luckily not restored, at Assisi, the guide-books have always mistaken the heart she holds for an apple:\u2014and my own belief is that originally, the Grammatic\u00eb of Simon Memmi made with her right hand the sign which said, \"Enter ye in at the Strait Gate,\" and with her left, the sign which said, \"My son, give me thine Heart.\"\n\nII. RHETORIC. Next to learning how to read and write, you are to learn to speak; and, young ladies and gentlemen, observe,\u2014to speak as little as possible, it is farther implied, till you have learned.\n\nIn the streets of Florence at this day you may hear much of what some people call \"rhetoric\"\u2014very passionate speaking indeed, and quite \"from the heart\"\u2014such hearts as the people have got. That is to say, you never hear a word uttered but in a rage, either just ready to burst, or for the most part, explosive instantly: everybody\u2014man, woman, or child\u2014roaring out their incontinent, foolish, infinitely contemptible opinions and wills, on every smallest occasion, with flashing eyes, hoarsely shrieking and wasted voices,\u2014insane hope to drag by vociferation whatever they would have, out of man and God.\n\nNow consider Simon Memmi's Rhetoric. The Science of Speaking, primarily; of making oneself heard therefore: which is not to be done by shouting. She alone, of all the sciences, carries a scroll: and being a speaker gives you something to read. It is not thrust forward at you at all, but held quietly down with her beautiful depressed right hand; her left hand set coolly and strongly on her side.\n\nAnd you will find that, thus, she alone of all the sciences needs no use of her hands. All the others have some important business for them. She none. She can do all with her lips, holding scroll, or bridle, or what you will, with her right hand, her left on her side.\n\nAgain, look at the talkers in the streets of Florence, and see how, being essentially unable to talk, they try to make lips of their fingers! How they poke, wave, flourish, point, jerk, shake finger and fist at their antagonists\u2014dumb essentially, all the while, if they knew it; unpersuasive and ineffectual, as the shaking of tree branches in the wind.\n\nYou will at first think her figure ungainly and stiff. It is so, partly, the dress being more coarsely repainted than in any other of the series. But she is meant to be both stout and strong. What she has to say is indeed to persuade you, if possible; but assuredly to overpower you. And she has not the Florentine girdle, for she does not want to move. She has her girdle broad at the waist\u2014of all the sciences, you would at first have thought, the one that most needed breath! No, says Simon Memmi. You want breath to run, or dance, or fight with. But to speak!\u2014If you know how, you can do your work with few words; very little of this pure Florentine air will be enough, if you shape it rightly.\nNote, also, that calm setting of her hand against her side. You think Rhetoric should be glowing, fervid, impetuous? No, says Simon Memmi. Above all things,\u2014cool.\n\nAnd now let us read what is written on her scroll:\u2014Mulceo, dum loquor, varios induta colores.\n\nHer chief function, to melt; make soft, thaw the hearts of men with kind fire; to overpower with peace; and bring rest, with rainbow colours. The chief mission of all words that they should be of comfort.\n\nYou think the function of words is to excite? Why, a red rag will do that, or a blast through a brass pipe. But to give calm and gentle heat; to be as the south wind, and the iridescent rain, to all bitterness of frost; and bring at once strength, and healing. This is the work of human lips, taught of God.\n\nOne farther and final lesson is given in the medallion above. Aristotle, and too many modern rhetoricians of his school, thought there could be good speaking in a false cause. But above Simon Memmi's Rhetoric is Truth, with her mirror.\n\nThere is a curious feeling, almost innate in men, that though they are bound to speak truth, in speaking to a single person, they may lie as much as they please, provided they lie to two or more people at once. There is the same feeling about killing: most people would shrink from shooting one innocent man; but will fire a mitrailleuse contentedly into an innocent regiment.\nWhen you look down from the figure of the Science, to that of Cicero, beneath, you will at first think it entirely overthrows my conclusion that Rhetoric has no need of her hands. For Cicero, it appears, has three instead of two.\n\nThe uppermost, at his chin, is the only genuine one. That raised, with the finger up, is entirely false. That on the book, is repainted so as to defy conjecture of its original action.\n\nBut observe how the gesture of the true one confirms instead of overthrowing what I have said above. Cicero is not speaking at all, but profoundly thinking before he speaks. It is the most abstractedly thoughtful face to be found among all the philosophers; and very beautiful. The whole is under Solomon, in the line of Prophets.\n\nTechnical Points.\u2014These two figures have suffered from restoration more than any others, but the right hand of Rhetoric is still entirely genuine, and the left, except the ends of the fingers. The ear, and hair just above it, are quite safe, the head well set on its original line, but the crown of leaves rudely retouched, and then faded. All the lower part of the figure of Cicero has been not only repainted but changed; the face is genuine\u2014I believe retouched, but so cautiously and skilfully, that it is probably now more beautiful than at first.\nIII. LOGIC. The science of reasoning, or more accurately Reason herself, or pure intelligence.\n\nScience to be gained after that of Expression, says Simon Memmi; so, young people, it appears, that though you must not speak before you have been taught how to speak, you may yet properly speak before you have been taught how to think.\n\nFor indeed, it is only by frank speaking that you can learn how to think. And it is no matter how wrong the first thoughts you have may be, provided you express them clearly;\u2014and are willing to have them put right.\n\nFortunately, nearly all of this beautiful figure is practically safe, the outlines pure everywhere, and the face perfect: the prettiest, as far as I know, which exists in Italian art of this early date. It is subtle to the extreme in gradations of colour: the eyebrows drawn, not with a sweep of the brush, but with separate cross touches in the line of their growth\u2014exquisitely pure in arch; the nose straight and fine; the lips\u2014playful slightly, proud, unerringly cut; the hair flowing in sequent waves, ordered as if in musical time; head perfectly upright on the shoulders; the height of the brow completed by a crimson frontlet set with pearls, surmounted by a fleur-de-lys.\n\nHer shoulders were exquisitely drawn, her white jacket fitting close to soft, yet scarcely rising breasts; her arms singularly strong, at perfect rest; her hands, exquisitely delicate. In her right, she holds a branching and leaf-bearing rod, (the syllogism); in her left, a scorpion with double sting, (the dilemma)\u2014more generally, the powers of rational construction and dissolution.\n\nBeneath her, Aristotle,\u2014intense keenness of search in his half-closed eyes.\n\nMedallion above, (less expressive than usual) a man writing, with his head stooped.\n\nThe whole under Isaiah, in the line of Prophets.\n\nTechnical Points.\u2014The only parts of this figure which have suffered seriously in repainting are the leaves of the rod, and the scorpion. I have no idea, as I said above, what the background once was; it is now a mere mess of scrabbled grey, carried over the vestiges, still with care much redeemable, of the richly ornamental extremity of the rod, which was a cluster of green leaves on a black ground. But the scorpion is indecipherably injured, most of it confused repainting, mixed with the white of the dress, the double sting emphatic enough still, but not on the first lines.\n\nThe Aristotle is very genuine throughout, except his hat, and I think that must be pretty nearly on the old lines, through I cannot trace them. They are good lines, new or old.\n\nIV. MUSIC. After you have learned to reason, young people, of course you will be very grave, if not dull, you think. No, says Simon Memmi. By no means anything of the kind. After learning to reason, you will learn to sing; for you will want to. There is so much reason for singing in the sweet world, when one thinks rightly of it. None for grumbling, provided always you have entered in at the strait gate. You will sing all along the road then, in a little while, in a manner pleasant for other people to hear.\n\nThis figure has been one of the loveliest in the series, an extreme refinement and tender severity being aimed at throughout. She is crowned, not with laurel, but with small leaves,\u2014I am not sure what they are, being too much injured: the face thin, abstracted, wistful; the lips not far open in their low singing; the hair rippling softly on the shoulders. She plays on a small organ, richly ornamented with Gothic tracery, the down slope of it set with crockets like those of Santa Maria del Fiore. Simon Memmi means that all music must be \"sacred.\" Not that you are never to sing anything but hymns, but that whatever is rightly called music, or work of the Muses, is divine in help and healing.\nThe actions of both hands are singularly sweet. The right is one of the loveliest things I ever saw done in painting. She is keeping down one note only, with her third finger, seen under the raised fourth: the thumb, just passing under; all the curves of the fingers exquisite, and the pale light and shade of the rosy flesh relieved against the ivory white and brown of the notes. Only the thumb and end of the forefinger are seen of the left hand, but they indicate enough its light pressure on the bellows. Fortunately, all these portions of the fresco are absolutely intact.\n\nUnderneath, Tubal-Cain. Not Jubal, as you would expect. Jubal is the inventor of musical instruments. Tubal-Cain, thought the old Florentines, invented harmony. They, the best smiths in the world, knew the differences in tones of hammer strokes on anvil. Curiously enough, the only piece of true part-singing, done beautifully and joyfully, which I have heard this year in Italy, (being south of Alps exactly six months, and ranging from Genoa to Palermo) was out of a busy smithy at Perugia. Of bestial howling, and entirely frantic vomiting up of hopelessly damned souls through their still carnal throats, I have heard more than, please God, I will ever endure the hearing of again in one of His summers.\nYou think Tubal-Cain very ugly? Yes. Much like a shaggy baboon: not accidentally, but with most scientific understanding of baboon character. Men must have looked like that, before they had invented harmony, or felt that one note differed from another, says, and knows Simon Memmi. Darwinism, like all widely popular and widely mischievous fallacies, has many a curious gleam and grain of truth in its tissue.\nUnder Moses.\n\nMedallion, a youth drinking. Otherwise, you might have thought only church music meant, and not feast music also.\n\nTechnical Points.\u2014The Tubal-Cain, one of the most entirely pure and precious remnants of the old painting, nothing lost: nothing but the redder ends of his beard retouched. Green dress of Music, in the body and over limbs entirely repainted: it was once beautifully embroidered; sleeves, partly genuine, hands perfect, face and hair nearly so. Leaf crown faded and broken away, but not retouched.\n\nV. ASTRONOMY. Properly Astro-logy, as (Theology) the knowledge of so much of the stars as we can know wisely; not the attempt to define their laws for them. Not that it is unbecoming of us to find out, if we can, that they move in ellipses, and so on; but it is no business of ours. What effects their rising and setting have on man, and beast, and leaf; what their times and changes are, seen and felt in this world, it is our business to know, passing our nights, if wakefully, by that divine candlelight, and no other.\n\nShe wears a dark purple robe; holds in her left hand the hollow globe with golden zodiac and meridians: lifts her right hand in noble awe.\n\"When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained.\"\n\nCrowned with gold, her dark hair in elliptic waves, bound with glittering chains of pearl. Her eyes dark, lifted.\n\nBeneath her, Zoroaster,[Footnote: Atlas! according to poor Vasari, and sundry modern guides. I find Vasari's mistakes usually of this brightly blundering kind. In matters needing research, after a while, I find he is right, usually.] entirely noble and beautiful, the delicate Persian head made softer still by the elaborately wreathed silken hair, twisted into the pointed beard, and into tapering plaits, falling on his shoulders. The head entirely thrown back, he looks up with no distortion of the delicately arched brow: writing, as he gazes.\nFor the association of the religion of the Magi with their own in the mind of the Florentines of this time, see \"Before the Soldan.\"\nThe dress must always have been white, because of its beautiful opposition to the purple above and that of Tubal-Cain beside it. But it has been too much repainted to be trusted anywhere, nothing left but a fold or two in the sleeves. The cast of it from the knees down is entirely beautiful, and I suppose on the old lines; but the restorer could throw a fold well when he chose. The warm light which relieves the purple of Zoroaster above, is laid in by him. I don't know if I should have liked it better, flat, as it was, against the dark purple; it seems to me quite beautiful now. The full red flush on the face of the Astronomy is the restorer's doing also. She was much paler, if not quite pale.\nUnder St. Luke.\n\nMedallion, a stern man, with sickle and spade. For the flowers, and for us, when stars have risen and set such and such times;\u2014remember.\nTechnical Points.\u2014Left hand globe, most of the important folds of the purple dress, eyes, mouth, hair in great part, and crown, genuine. Golden tracery on border of dress lost; extremity of falling folds from left sleeve altered and confused, but the confusion prettily got out of. Right hand and much of face and body of dress repainted.\n\nZoroaster's head quite pure. Dress repainted, but carefully, leaving the hair untouched. Right hand and pen, now a common feathered quill, entirely repainted, but dexterously and with feeling. The hand was once slightly different in position, and held, most probably, a reed.\nVI. GEOMETRY. You have now learned, young ladies and gentlemen, to read, to speak, to think, to sing, and to see. You are getting old, and will have soon to think of being married; you must learn to build your house, therefore. Here is your carpenter's square for you, and you may safely and wisely contemplate the ground a little, and the measures and laws relating to that, seeing you have got to abide upon it:\u2014and that you have properly looked at the stars; not before then, lest, had you studied the ground first, you might perchance never have raised your heads from it. This is properly the science of all laws of practical labour, issuing in beauty.\n\nShe looks down, a little puzzled, greatly interested, holding her carpenter's square in her left hand, not wanting that but for practical work; following a diagram with her right.\n\nHer beauty, altogether soft and in curves, I commend to your notice, as the exact opposite of what a vulgar designer would have imagined for her. Note the wreath of hair at the back of her head, which though fastened by a spiral fillet, escapes at last, and flies off loose in a sweeping curve. Contemplative Theology is the only other of the sciences who has such wavy hair.\n\nBeneath her, Euclid, in white turban. Very fine and original work throughout; but nothing of special interest in him.\n\nUnder St. Matthew.\n\nMedallion, a soldier with a straight sword (best for science of defence), octagon shield, helmet like the beehive of Canton Vaud. As the secondary use of music in feasting, so the secondary use of geometry in war\u2014her noble art being all in sweetest peace\u2014is shown in the medallion.\n\nTechnical Points.\u2014It is more than fortunate that in nearly every figure, the original outline of the hair is safe. Geometry's has scarcely been retouched at all, except at the ends, once in single knots, now in confused double ones. The hands, girdle, most of her dress, and her black carpenter's square are original. Face and breast repainted.\n\nVII. ARITHMETIC. Having built your house, young people, and understanding the light of heaven, and the measures of earth, you may marry\u2014and can't do better. And here is now your conclusive science, which you will have to apply, all your days, to all your affairs.\nThe Science of Number. Infinite in solemnity of use in Italy at this time; including, of course, whatever was known of the higher abstract mathematics and mysteries of numbers, but reverenced especially in its vital necessity to the prosperity of families and kingdoms, and first fully so understood here in commercial Florence.\n\nHer hand lifted, with two fingers bent, two straight, solemnly enforcing on your attention her primal law\u2014Two and two are\u2014four, you observe,\u2014not five, as those accursed usurers think.\n\nUnder her, Pythagoras.\n\nAbove, medallion of king, with sceptre and globe, counting money. Have you ever chanced to read carefully Carlyle's account of the foundation of the existing Prussian empire, in economy?\n\nYou can, at all events, consider with yourself a little, what empire this queen of the terrestrial sciences must hold over the rest, if they are to be put to good use; or what depth and breadth of application there is in the brief parables of the counted cost of Power, and number of Armies.\n\nTo give a very minor, but characteristic, instance. I have always felt that with my intense love of the Alps, I ought to have been able to make a drawing of Chamouni, or the vale of Cluse, which should give people more pleasure than a photograph; but I always wanted to do it as I saw it, and engrave pine for pine, and crag for crag, like Albert D\u00fcrer. I broke my strength down for many a year, always tiring of my work, or finding the leaves drop off, or the snow come on, before I had well begun what I meant to do. If I had only counted my pines first, and calculated the number of hours necessary to do them in the manner of D\u00fcrer, I should have saved the available drawing time of some five years, spent in vain effort.\n\nBut Turner counted his pines, and did all that could be done for them, and rested content with that.\n\nSo in all the affairs of life, the arithmetical part of the business is the dominant one. How many and how much have we? How many and how much do we want? How constantly does noble Arithmetic of the finite lose itself in base Avarice of the Infinite, and in blind imagination of it! In counting of minutes, is our arithmetic ever solicitous enough? In counting our days, is she ever severe enough? How we shrink from putting, in their decades, the diminished store of them! And if we ever pray the solemn prayer that we may be taught to number them, do we even try to do it after praying?\n\nTechnical Points.\u2014The Pythagoras almost entirely genuine. The upper figures, from this inclusive to the outer wall, I have not been able to examine thoroughly, my scaffolding not extending beyond the Geometry.\n\nHere then we have the sum of sciences,\u2014seven, according to the Florentine mind\u2014necessary to the secular education of man and woman. Of these the modern average respectable English gentleman and gentlewoman know usually only a little of the last, and entirely hate the prudent applications of that: being unacquainted, except as they chance here and there to pick up a broken piece of information, with either grammar, rhetoric, music, [Footnote: Being able to play the piano and admire Mendelssohn is not knowing music.] astronomy, or geometry; and are not only unacquainted with logic, or the use of reason, themselves, but instinctively antagonistic to its use by anybody else.\n\nWe are now to read the series of the Divine sciences, beginning at the opposite side, next the window.\n\nVIII. CIVIL LAW. Civil, or 'of citizens,' not only as distinguished from Ecclesiastical, but from Local law. She is the universal Justice of the peaceful relations of men throughout the world, therefore holds the globe, with its three quarters, white, as being justly governed, in her left hand.\n\nShe is also the law of eternal equity, not erring statute; therefore holds her sword level across her breast. She is the foundation of all other divine science. To know anything whatever about God, you must begin by being Just.\n\nDressed in red, which in these frescoes is always a sign of power, or zeal; but her face very calm, gentle and beautiful. Her hair bound close, and crowned by the royal circlet of gold, with pure thirteenth century strawberry leaf ornament.\n\nUnder her, the Emperor Justinian, in blue, with conical mitre of white and gold; the face in profile, very beautiful. The imperial staff in his right hand, the Institutes in his left.\n\nMedallion, a figure, apparently in distress, appealing for justice. (Trajan's suppliant widow?)\n\nTechnical Points.\u2014The three divisions of the globe in her hand were originally inscribed ASIA, AFRICA, EUROPE. The restorer has ingeniously changed AF into AME\u2014RICA. Faces, both of the science and emperor, little retouched, nor any of the rest altered.\n\nIX. CHRISTIAN LAW. After the justice which rules men, comes that which rules the Church of Christ. The distinction is not between secular law, and ecclesiastical authority, but between the equity of humanity, and the law of Christian discipline.\n\nIn full, straight-falling, golden robe, with white mantle over it; a church in her left hand; her right raised, with the forefinger lifted; (indicating heavenly source of all Christian law? or warning?)\n\nHead-dress, a white veil floating into folds in the air. You will find nothing in these frescoes without significance; and as the escaping hair of Geometry indicates the infinite conditions of lines of the higher orders, so the floating veil here indicates that the higher relations of Christian justice are indefinable. So her golden mantle indicates that it is a glorious and excellent justice beyond that which unchristian men conceive; while the severely falling lines of the folds, which form a kind of gabled niche for the head of the Pope beneath, correspond with the strictness of true Church discipline firmer as well as more luminous statute.\n\nBeneath, Pope Clement V., in red, lifting his hand, not in the position of benediction, but, I suppose, of injunction,\u2014only the forefinger straight, the second a little bent, the two last quite. Note the strict level of the book; and the vertical directness of the key.\nThe medallion puzzles me. It looks like a figure counting money.\n\nTechnical Points.\u2014Fairly well preserved; but the face of the science retouched: the grotesquely false perspective of the Pope's tiara, one of the most curiously na\u00efve examples of the entirely ignorant feeling after merely scientific truth of form which still characterized Italian art.\n\nType of church interesting in its extreme simplicity; no idea of transept, campanile, or dome.\n\nX. PRACTICAL THEOLOGY. The beginning of the knowledge of God being Human Justice, and its elements defined by Christian Law, the application of the law so defined follows, first with respect to man, then with respect to God.\n\n\"Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's\u2014and to God the things that are God's.\"\n\nWe have therefore now two sciences, one of our duty\u2014to men, the other to their Maker.\n\nThis is the first: duty to men. She holds a circular medallion, representing Christ preaching on the Mount, and points with her right hand to the earth.\n\nThe sermon on the Mount is perfectly expressed by the craggy pinnacle in front of Christ, and the high dark horizon. There is curious evidence throughout all these frescos of Simon Memmi's having read the Gospels with a quite clear understanding of their innermost meaning.\nI have called this science Practical Theology:\u2014the instructive knowledge, that is to say, of what God would have us do, personally, in any given human relation: and the speaking His Gospel therefore by act. \"Let your light so shine before men.\"\n\nShe wears a green dress, like Music her hair in the Arabian arch, with jewelled diadem.\n\nUnder David. Medallion, Almsgiving. Beneath her, Peter Lombard,\n\nTechnical Points.\u2014It is curious that while the instinct of perspective was not strong enough to enable any painter at this time to foreshorten a foot, it yet suggested to them the expression of elevation by raising the horizon.\n\nI have not examined the retouching. The hair and diadem at least are genuine, the face is dignified and compassionate, and much on the old lines.\n\nXI. DEVOTIONAL THEOLOGY.\u2014Giving glory to God, or, more accurately, whatever feelings He desires us to have towards Him, whether of affection or awe.\n\nThis is the science or method of devotion for Christians universally, just as the Practical Theology is their science or method of action.\nIn blue and red: a narrow black rod still traceable in the left hand; I am not sure of its meaning. (\"Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me?\") The other hand open in admiration, like Astronomy's; but Devotion's is held at her breast. Her head very characteristic of Memmi, with upturned eyes, and Arab arch in hair. Under her, Dionysius the Areopagite\u2014mending his pen! But I am doubtful of Lord Lindsay's identification of this figure, and the action is curiously common and meaningless. It may have meant that meditative theology is essentially a writer, not a preacher.\n\nThe medallion, on the other hand, is as ingenious. A mother lifting her hands in delight at her child's beginning to take notice.\nUnder St. Paul.\n\nTechnical Points.\u2014Both figures very genuine, the lower one almost entirely so. The painting of the red book is quite exemplary in fresco style.\n\nXII. DOGMATIC THEOLOGY.\u2014After action and worship, thought becoming too wide and difficult, the need of dogma becomes felt; the assertion, that is, within limited range, of the things that are to be believed.\n\nSince whatever pride and folly pollute Christian scholarship naturally delight in dogma, the science itself cannot but be in a kind of disgrace among sensible men: nevertheless it would be difficult to overvalue the peace and security which have been given to humble persons by forms of creed; and it is evident that either there is no such thing as theology, or some of its knowledge must be thus, if not expressible, at least reducible within certain limits of expression, so as to be protected from misinterpretation.\n\nIn red,\u2014again the sign of power,\u2014crowned with a black (once golden?) triple crown, emblematic of the Trinity. The left hand holding a scoop for winnowing corn; the other points upwards.  \"Prove all things\u2014hold fast that which is good, or of God.\"\n\nBeneath her, Boethius. Under St. Mark. Medallion, female figure, laying hands on breast.\n\nTechnical Points.\u2014The Boethius entirely genuine, and the painting of his black book, as of the red one beside it, again worth notice, showing how pleasant and interesting the commonest things become, when well painted.\n\nI have not examined the upper figure.\n\nXIII. MYSTIC THEOLOGY. [Footnote: Blunderingly in the guide-books called 'Faith!'] Monastic science, above dogma, and attaining to new revelation by reaching higher spiritual states.\n\nIn white robes, her left hand gloved (I don't know why)\u2014holding chalice. She wears a nun's veil fastened under her chin, her hair fastened close, like Grammar's, showing her necessary monastic life; all states of mystic spiritual life involving retreat from much that is allowable in the material and practical world.\n\nThere is no possibility of denying this fact, infinite as the evils are which have arisen from misuse of it. They have been chiefly induced by persons who falsely pretended to lead monastic life, and led it without having natural faculty for it. But many more lamentable errors have arisen from the pride of really noble persons, who have thought it would be a more pleasing thing to God to be a sibyl or a witch, than a useful housewife. Pride is always somewhat involved even in the true effort: the scarlet head-dress in the form of a horn on the forehead in the fresco indicates this, both here, and in the Contemplative Theology.\n\nUnder St. John.\nMedallion unintelligible, to me. A woman laying hands on the shoulders of two small figures.\n\nTechnical Points.\u2014More of the minute folds of the white dress left than in any other of the repainted draperies. It is curious that minute division has always in drapery, more or less, been understood as an expression of spiritual life, from the delicate folds of Athena's peplus down to the rippled edges of modern priests' white robes; Titian's breadth of fold, on the other hand, meaning for the most part bodily power. The relation of the two modes of composition was lost by Michael Angelo, who thought to express spirit by making flesh colossal.\n\nFor the rest, the figure is not of any interest, Memmi's own mind being intellectual rather than mystic.\n\nXIV. POLEMIC THEOLOGY.[Footnote: Blunderingly called 'Charity' in the guide-books.]\n\n\"Who goes forth, conquering and to conquer?\" \"For we war, not with flesh and blood,\" etc.\n\nIn red, as sign of power, but not in armour, because she is herself invulnerable. A close red cap, with cross for crest, instead of helmet. Bow in left hand; long arrow in right.\n\nShe partly means Aggressive Logic: compare the set of her shoulders and arms with Logic's.\n\nShe is placed the last of the Divine sciences, not as their culminating power, but as the last which can be rightly learned. You must know all the others, before you go out to battle. Whereas the general principle of modern Christendom is to go out to battle without knowing any one of the others; one of the reasons for this error, the prince of errors, being the vulgar notion that truth may be ascertained by debate! Truth is never learned, in any department of industry, by arguing, but by working, and observing. And when you have got good hold of one truth, for certain, two others will grow out of it, in a beautifully dicotyledonous fashion, (which, as before noticed, is the meaning of the branch in Logic's right hand). Then, when you have got so much true knowledge as is worth fighting for, you are bound to fight for it. But not to debate about it, any more.\n\nThere is, however, one further reason for Polemic Theology being put beside Mystic. It is only in some approach to mystic science that any man becomes aware of what St. Paul means by \"spiritual wickedness in heavenly [Footnote: With cowardly intentional fallacy, translated 'high' in the English Bible.] places;\"  or, in any true sense, knows the enemies of God and of man.\n\nBeneath St. Augustine. Showing you the proper method of controversy;\u2014perfectly firm; perfectly gentle.\n\nYou are to distinguish, of course, controversy from rebuke. The assertion of truth is to be always gentle: the chastisement of wilful falsehood may be\u2014very much the contrary indeed. Christ's sermon on the Mount is full of polemic theology, yet perfectly gentle:\u2014 \"Ye have heard that it hath been said\u2014but I say unto you\";\u2014\"And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others?\" and the like. But His \"Ye fools and blind, for whether is greater,\" is not merely the exposure of error, but rebuke of the avarice which made that error possible.\nUnder the throne of St. Thomas; and next to Arithmetic, of the terrestrial sciences.\n\nMedallion, a soldier, but not interesting.\n\nTechnical Points.\u2014Very genuine and beautiful throughout. Note the use of St. Augustine's red bands, to connect him with the full red of the upper figures; and compare the niche formed by the dress of Canon Law, above the Pope, for different artistic methods of attaining the same object,\u2014unity of composition.\n\nBut lunch time is near, my friends, and you have that shopping to do, you know.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path":

of Green-head Gill,\nYou will suppose that with an upright path\nYour feet must struggle; in such bold ascent\nThe pastoral Mountains front you, face to face.\nBut, courage! for beside that boisterous Brook\nThe mountains have all open'd out themselves,\nAnd made a hidden valley of their own.\n\nNo habitation there is seen; but such\nAs journey thither find themselves alone\nWith a few sheep, with rocks and stones, and kites\nThat overhead are sailing in the sky.\nIt is in truth an utter solitude,\nNor should I have made mention of this Dell\nBut for one object which you might pass by,\nMight see and notice not. Beside the brook\nThere is a straggling heap of unhewn stones!\nAnd to that place a story appertains,\nWhich, though it be ungarnish'd with events,\nIs not unfit, I deem, for the fire-side,\nOr for the summer shade. It was the first,\nThe earliest of those tales that spake to me\nOf Shepherds, dwellers in the vallies, men\nWhom I already lov'd, not verily\nFor their own sakes, but for the fields and hills\nWhere was their occupation and abode.\nAnd hence this Tale, while I was yet a boy\nCareless of books, yet having felt the power\nOf Nature, by the gentle agency\nOf natural objects led me on to feel\nFor passions that were not my own, and think\nAt random and imperfectly indeed\nOn man; the heart of man and human life.\nTherefore, although it be a history\nHomely and rude, I will relate the same\nFor the delight of a few natural hearts,\nAnd with yet fonder feeling, for the sake\nOf youthful Poets, who among these Hills\nWill be my second self when I am gone.\n\n\nUpon the Forest-side in Grasmere Vale\nThere dwelt a Shepherd, Michael was his name.\nAn old man, stout of heart, and strong of limb.\nHis bodily frame had been from youth to age\nOf an unusual strength: his mind was keen\nIntense and frugal, apt for all affairs,\nAnd in his Shepherd's calling he was prompt\nAnd watchful more than ordinary men.\n\nHence he had learn'd the meaning of all winds,\nOf blasts of every tone, and often-times\nWhen others heeded not, He heard the South\nMake subterraneous music, like the noise\nOf Bagpipers on distant Highland hills;\nThe Shepherd, at such warning, of his flock\nBethought him, and he to himself would say\nThe winds are now devising work for me!\nAnd truly at all times the storm, that drives\nThe Traveller to a shelter, summon'd him\nUp to the mountains: he had been alone\nAmid the heart of many thousand mists\nThat came to him and left him on the heights.\nSo liv'd he till his eightieth year was pass'd.\n\nAnd grossly that man errs, who should suppose\nThat the green Valleys, and the Streams and Rocks\nWere things indifferent to the Shepherd's thoughts.\nFields, where with chearful spirits he had breath'd\nThe common air; the hills, which he so oft\nHad climb'd with vigorous steps; which had impress'd\nSo many incidents upon his mind\nOf hardship, skill or courage, joy or fear;\nWhich like a book preserv'd the memory\nOf the dumb animals, whom he had sav'd,\nHad fed or shelter'd, linking to such acts,\nSo grateful in themselves, the certainty\nOf honorable gains; these fields, these hills\nWhich were his living Being, even more\nThan his own Blood--what could they less? had laid\nStrong hold on his affections, were to him\nA pleasurable feeling of blind love,\nThe pleasure which there is in life itself.\nHe had not passed his days in singleness.\nHe had a Wife, a comely Matron, old\nThough younger than himself full twenty years.\nShe was a woman of a stirring life\nWhose heart was in her house: two wheels she had\nOf antique form, this large for spinning wool,\nThat small for flax, and if one wheel had rest,\nIt was because the other was at work.\nThe Pair had but one Inmate in their house,\nAn only Child, who had been born to them\nWhen Michael telling o'er his years began\nTo deem that he was old, in Shepherd's phrase,\nWith one foot in the grave. This only son,\nWith two brave sheep dogs tried in many a storm.\n\nThe one of an inestimable worth,\nMade all their Household. I may truly say,\nThat they were as a proverb in the vale\nFor endless industry. When day was gone,\nAnd from their occupations out of doors\nThe Son and Father were come home, even then,\nTheir labour did not cease, unless when all\nTurn'd to their cleanly supper-board, and there\nEach with a mess of pottage and skimm'd milk,\nSate round their basket pil'd with oaten cakes,\nAnd their plain home-made cheese. Yet when their meal\nWas ended, LUKE (for so the Son was nam'd)\nAnd his old Father, both betook themselves\nTo such convenient work, as might employ\nTheir hands by the fire-side; perhaps to card\nWool for the House-wife's spindle, or repair\nSome injury done to sickle, flail, or scythe,\nOr other implement of house or field.\n\nDown from the cicling by the chimney's edge,\nWhich in our ancient uncouth country style\nDid with a huge projection overbrow\nLarge space beneath, as duly as the light\nOf day grew dim, the House-wife hung a lamp;\nAn aged utensil, which had perform'd\nService beyond all others of its kind.\n\nEarly at evening did it burn and late,\nSurviving Comrade of uncounted Hours\nWhich going by from year to year had found\nAnd left the Couple neither gay perhaps\nNor chearful, yet with objects and with hopes\nLiving a life of eager industry.\n\nAnd now, when LUKE was in his eighteenth year,\nThere by the light of this old lamp they sate,\nFather and Son, while late into the night\nThe House-wife plied her own peculiar work,\nMaking the cottage thro' the silent hours\nMurmur as with the sound of summer flies.\n\nNot with a waste of words, but for the sake\nOf pleasure, which I know that I shall give\nTo many living now, I of this Lamp\nSpeak thus minutely: for there are no few\nWhose memories will bear witness to my tale,\nThe Light was famous in its neighbourhood,\nAnd was a public Symbol of the life,\nThe thrifty Pair had liv'd. For, as it chanc'd,\nTheir Cottage on a plot of rising ground\nStood single, with large prospect North and South,\nHigh into Easedale, up to Dunmal-Raise,\nAnd Westward to the village near the Lake.\nAnd from this constant light so regular\nAnd so far seen, the House itself by all\nWho dwelt within the limits of the vale,\nBoth old and young, was nam'd The Evening Star.\n\nThus living on through such a length of years,\nThe Shepherd, if he lov'd himself, must needs\nHave lov'd his Help-mate; but to Michael's heart\nThis Son of his old age was yet more dear--\nEffect which might perhaps have been produc'd\nBy that instinctive tenderness, the same\nBlind Spirit, which is in the blood of all,\nOr that a child, more than all other gifts,\nBrings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts,\nAnd stirrings of inquietude, when they\nBy tendency of nature needs must fail.\n\nFrom such, and other causes, to the thoughts\nOf the old Man his only Son was now\nThe dearest object that he knew on earth.\nExceeding was the love he bare to him,\nHis Heart and his Heart's joy! For oftentimes\nOld Michael, while he was a babe in arms,\nHad done him female service, not alone\nFor dalliance and delight, as is the use\nOf Fathers, but with patient mind enforc'd\nTo acts of tenderness; and he had rock'd\nHis cradle with a woman's gentle hand.\n\nAnd in a later time, ere yet the Boy\nHad put on Boy's attire, did Michael love,\nAlbeit of a stern unbending mind,\nTo have the young one in his sight, when he\nHad work by his own door, or when he sate\nWith sheep before him on his Shepherd's stool,\nBeneath that large old Oak, which near their door\nStood, and from it's enormous breadth of shade\nChosen for the Shearer's covert from the sun,\nThence in our rustic dialect was call'd\nThe CLIPPING TREE, *[1] a name which yet it bears.\n\nThere, while they two were sitting in the shade,\nWith others round them, earnest all and blithe,\nWould Michael exercise his heart with looks\nOf fond correction and reproof bestow'd\nUpon the child, if he dislurb'd the sheep\nBy catching at their legs, or with his shouts\nScar'd them, while they lay still beneath the shears.\n\nAnd when by Heaven's good grace the Boy grew up\nA healthy Lad, and carried in his cheek\nTwo steady roses that were five years old,\nThen Michael from a winter coppice cut\nWith his own hand a sapling, which he hoop'd\nWith iron, making it throughout in all\nDue requisites a perfect Shepherd's Staff,\nAnd gave it to the Boy; wherewith equipp'd\nHe as a Watchman oftentimes was plac'd\nAt gate or gap, to stem or turn the flock,\nAnd to his office prematurely call'd\nThere stood the urchin, as you will divine,\nSomething between a hindrance and a help,\nAnd for this cause not always, I believe,\nReceiving from his Father hire of praise.\n\nWhile this good household thus were living on\nFrom day to day, to Michael's ear there came\nDistressful tidings. Long before, the time\nOf which I speak, the Shepherd had been bound\nIn surety for his Brother's Son, a man\nOf an industrious life, and ample means,\nBut unforeseen misfortunes suddenly\nHad press'd upon him, and old Michael now\nWas summon'd to discharge the forfeiture,\nA grievous penalty, but little less\nThan half his substance. This un-look'd-for claim\nAt the first hearing, for a moment took\nMore hope out of his life than he supposed\nThat any old man ever could have lost.\n\nAs soon as he had gather'd so much strength\nThat he could look his trouble in the face,\nIt seem'd that his sole refuge was to sell\nA portion of his patrimonial fields.\nSuch was his first resolve; he thought again,\nAnd his heart fail'd him. \"Isabel,\" said he,\nTwo evenings after he had heard the news,\n\"I have been toiling more than seventy years,\nAnd in the open sun-shine of God's love\nHave we all liv'd, yet if these fields of ours\nShould pass into a Stranger's hand, I think\nThat I could not lie quiet in my grave.\"\n\n\"Our lot is a hard lot; the Sun itself\nHas scarcely been more diligent than I,\nAnd I have liv'd to be a fool at last\nTo my own family. An evil Man\nThat was, and made an evil choice, if he\nWere false to us; and if he were not false,\nThere are ten thousand to whom loss like this\nHad been no sorrow. I forgive him--but\n'Twere better to be dumb than to talk thus.\nWhen I began, my purpose was to speak\nOf remedies and of a chearful hope.\"\n\n\"Our Luke shall leave us, Isabel; the land\nShall not go from us, and it shall be free,\nHe shall possess it, free as is the wind\nThat passes over it. We have, thou knowest,\nAnother Kinsman, he will be our friend\nIn this distress. He is a prosperous man,\nThriving in trade, and Luke to him shall go,\nAnd with his Kinsman's help and his own thrift,\nHe quickly will repair this loss, and then\nMay come again to us. If here he stay,\nWhat can be done? Where every one is poor\nWhat can be gain'd?\" At this, the old man paus'd,\nAnd Isabel sate silent, for her mind\nWas busy, looking back into past times.\n\nThere's Richard Bateman, thought she to herself,\nHe was a parish-boy--at the church-door\nThey made a gathering for him, shillings, pence,\nAnd halfpennies, wherewith the Neighbours bought\nA Basket, which they fill'd with Pedlar's wares,\nAnd with this Basket on his arm, the Lad\nWent up to London, found a Master there,\nWho out of many chose the trusty Boy\nTo go and overlook his merchandise\nBeyond the seas, where he grew wond'rous rich,\nAnd left estates and monies to the poor,\nAnd at his birth-place built a Chapel, floor'd\nWith Marble, which he sent from foreign lands.\nThese thoughts, and many others of like sort,\nPass'd quickly thro' the mind of Isabel,\nAnd her face brighten'd. The Old Man was glad.\n\nAnd thus resum'd. \"Well I Isabel, this scheme\nThese two days has been meat and drink to me.\nFar more than we have lost is left us yet.\n--We have enough--I wish indeed that I\nWere younger, but this hope is a good hope.\n--Make ready Luke's best garments, of the best\nBuy for him more, and let us send him forth\nTo-morrow, or the next day, or to-night:\n--If he could go, the Boy should go to-night.\"\nHere Michael ceas'd, and to the fields went forth\nWith a light heart. The House-wife for five days\nWas restless morn and night, and all day long\nWrought on with her best fingers to prepare\nThings needful for the journey of her Son.\n\nBut Isabel was glad when Sunday came\nTo stop her in her work; for, when she lay\nBy Michael's side, she for the two last nights\nHeard him, how he was troubled in his sleep:\nAnd when they rose at morning she could see\nThat all his hopes were gone. That day at noon\nShe said to Luke, while they two by themselves\nWere sitting at the door, \"Thou must not go,\nWe have no other Child but thee to lose,\nNone to remember--do not go away,\nFor if thou leave thy Father he will die.\"\nThe Lad made answer with a jocund voice,\nAnd Isabel, when she had told her fears,\nRecover'd heart. That evening her best fare\nDid she bring forth, and all together sate\nLike happy people round a Christmas fire.\n\nNext morning Isabel resum'd her work,\nAnd all the ensuing week the house appear'd\nAs cheerful as a grove in Spring: at length\nThe expected letter from their Kinsman came,\nWith kind assurances that he would do\nHis utmost for the welfare of the Boy,\nTo which requests were added that forthwith\nHe might be sent to him. Ten times or more\nThe letter was read over; Isabel\nWent forth to shew it to the neighbours round:\nNor was there at that time on English Land\nA prouder heart than Luke's. When Isabel\nHad to her house return'd, the Old Man said,\n\"He shall depart to-morrow.\" To this word\nThe House--wife answered, talking much of things\nWhich, if at such, short notice he should go,\nWould surely be forgotten. But at length\nShe gave consent, and Michael was at ease.\n\nNear the tumultuous brook of Green-head Gill,\nIn that deep Valley, Michael had design'd\nTo build a Sheep-fold, and, before he heard\nThe tidings of his melancholy loss,\nFor this same purpose he had gathered up\nA heap of stones, which close to the brook side\nLay thrown together, ready for the work.\nWith Luke that evening thitherward he walk'd;\nAnd soon as they had reach'd the place he stopp'd,\nAnd thus the Old Man spake to him. \"My Son,\nTo-morrow thou wilt leave me; with full heart\nI look upon thee, for thou art the same\nThat wert a promise to me ere thy birth,\nAnd all thy life hast been my daily joy.\nI will relate to thee some little part\nOf our two histories; 'twill do thee good\nWhen thou art from me, even if I should speak\nOf things thou caust not know of.--After thou\nFirst cam'st into the world, as it befalls\nTo new-born infants, thou didst sleep away\nTwo days, and blessings from thy Father's tongue\nThen fell upon thee. Day by day pass'd on,\nAnd still I lov'd thee with encreasing love.\"\nNever to living ear came sweeter sounds\nThan when I heard thee by our own fire-side\nFirst uttering without words a natural tune,\nWhen thou, a feeding babe, didst in thy joy\nSing at thy Mother's breast. Month follow'd month,\nAnd in the open fields my life was pass'd\nAnd in the mountains, else I think that thou\nHadst been brought up upon thy father's knees.\n--But we were playmates, Luke; among these hills,\nAs well thou know'st, in us the old and young\nHave play'd together, nor with me didst thou\nLack any pleasure which a boy can know.\nLuke had a manly heart; but at these words\nHe sobb'd aloud; the Old Man grasp'd his hand,\nAnd said, \"Nay do not take it so--I see\nThat these are things of which I need not speak.\n--Even to the utmost I have been to thee\nA kind and a good Father: and herein\nI but repay a gift which I myself\nReceiv'd at others' hands, for, though now old\nBeyond the common life of man, I still\nRemember them who lov'd me in my youth.\"\n\nBoth of them sleep together: here they liv'd\nAs all their Forefathers had done, and when\nAt length their time was come, they were not loth\nTo give their bodies to the family mold.\nI wish'd that thou should'st live the life they liv'd.\nBut 'tis a long time to look back, my Son,\nAnd see so little gain from sixty years.\nThese fields were burthen'd when they came to me;\n'Till I was forty years of age, not more\nThan half of my inheritance was mine.\n\n\"I toil'd and toil'd; God bless'd me in my work,\nAnd 'till these three weeks past the land was free.\n--It looks as if it never could endure\nAnother Master. Heaven forgive me, Luke,\nIf I judge ill for thee, but it seems good\nThat thou should'st go.\" At this the Old Man paus'd,\nThen, pointing to the Stones near which they stood,\nThus, after a short silence, he resum'd:\n\"This was a work for us, and now, my Son,\nIt is a work for me. But, lay one Stone--\nHere, lay it for me, Luke, with thine own hands.\nI for the purpose brought thee to this place.\"\n\nNay, Boy, be of good hope:--we both may live\nTo see a better day. At eighty-four\nI still am strong and stout;--do thou thy part,\nI will do mine.--I will begin again\nWith many tasks that were resign'd to thee;\nUp to the heights, and in among the storms,\nWill I without thee go again, and do\nAll works which I was wont to do alone,\nBefore I knew thy face.--Heaven bless thee, Boy!\nThy heart these two weeks has been beating fast\nWith many hopes--it should be so--yes--yes--\nI knew that thou could'st never have a wish\nTo leave me, Luke, thou hast been bound to me\nOnly by links of love, when thou art gone\nWhat will be left to us!--But, I forget\nMy purposes. Lay now the corner-stone,\nAs I requested, and hereafter, Luke,\nWhen thou art gone away, should evil men\nBe thy companions, let this Sheep-fold be\nThy anchor and thy shield; amid all fear\nAnd all temptation, let it be to thee\nAn emblem of the life thy Fathers liv'd,\nWho, being innocent, did for that cause\nBestir them in good deeds. Now, fare thee well--\nWhen thou return'st, thou in this place wilt see\nA work which is not here, a covenant\n'Twill be between us--but whatever fate\nBefall thee, I shall love thee to the last,\nAnd bear thy memory with me to the grave.\n\nThe Shepherd ended here; and Luke stoop'd down,\nAnd as his Father had requested, laid\nThe first stone of the Sheep-fold; at the sight\nThe Old Man's grief broke from him, to his heart\nHe press'd his Son, he kissed him and wept;\nAnd to the House together they return'd.\n\nNext morning, as had been resolv'd, the Boy\nBegan his journey, and when he had reach'd\nThe public Way, he put on a bold face;\nAnd all the Neighbours as he pass'd their doors\nCame forth, with wishes and with farewell pray'rs,\nThat follow'd him 'till he was out of sight.\n\nA good report did from their Kinsman come,\nOf Luke and his well-doing; and the Boy\nWrote loving letters, full of wond'rous news,\nWhich, as the House-wife phrased it, were throughout\nThe prettiest letters that were ever seen.\n\nBoth parents read them with rejoicing hearts.\nSo, many months pass'd on: and once again\nThe Shepherd went about his daily work\nWith confident and cheerful thoughts; and now\nSometimes when he could find a leisure hour\nHe to that valley took his way, and there\nWrought at the Sheep-fold. Meantime Luke began\nTo slacken in his duty, and at length\nHe in the dissolute city gave himself\nTo evil courses: ignominy and shame\nFell on him, so that he was driven at last\nTo seek a hiding-place beyond the seas.\nThere is a comfort in the strength of love;\n'Twill make a thing endurable, which else\nWould break the heart:--Old Michael found it so.\nI have convers'd with more than one who well\nRemember the Old Man, and what he was\nYears after he had heard this heavy news.\nHis bodily frame had been from youth to age\nOf an unusual strength. Among the rocks\nHe went, and still look'd up upon the sun.\nAnd listen'd to the wind; and as before\nPerform'd all kinds of labour for his Sheep,\nAnd for the land his small inheritance.\n\nAnd to that hollow Dell from time to time\nDid he repair, to build the Fold of which\nHis flock had need. 'Tis not forgotten yet\nThe pity which was then in every heart\nFor the Old Man--ands 'tis believ'd by all\nThat many and many a day he thither went,\nAnd never lifted up a single stone.\nThere, by the Sheep-fold, sometimes was he seen\nSitting alone, with that his faithful Dog,\nThen old, beside him, lying at his feet.\nThe length of full seven years from time to time\nHe at the building of this Sheep-fold wrought,\nAnd left the work unfinished when he died.\n\nThree years, or little more, did Isabel,\nSurvive her Husband: at her death the estate\nWas sold, and went into a Stranger's hand.\nThe Cottage which was nam'd The Evening Star\nIs gone, the ploughshare has been through the ground\nOn which it stood; great changes have been wrought\nIn all the neighbourhood, yet the Oak is left\nThat grew beside their Door; and the remains\nOf the unfinished Sheep-fold may be seen\nBeside the boisterous brook of Green-head Gill.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 502, "api_path": "/songs/141146", "artist_names": "James Joyce", "full_title": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe) by\u00a0James\u00a0Joyce", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "id": 141146, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 149810, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1654772452, "path": "/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-15-circe-annotated", "pyongs_count": 10, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-15-circe-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1922, "month": 2, "day": 2}, "release_date_for_display": "February 2, 1922", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 2, 1922", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 361, "hot": false, "pageviews": 50072}, "title": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe)", "title_with_featured": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe)", "updated_by_human_at": 1654772453, "url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-15-circe-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/22971", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/98f10611fc0aa6a525b9fbcab2ffa297.1000x600x1.jpg", "id": 22971, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9997f2e769ef85b9f941405cac99d1af.570x570x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "James Joyce", "slug": "James-joyce", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/James-joyce"}, "artist": "James Joyce", "lyrics": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe) LyricsThe Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals.

The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?\n\nTHE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)\n\n(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)\n\nLONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me.

Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral.

You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape.

Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening.

You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury.

Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.)

God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father!

(He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!\n\n\nTHE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!\n\n\n(The rams' horns sound for silence.

I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S.

Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined.

She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps.

Ahhkkk!\n\nELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.\n\nZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.\n\nFLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.\n\nSTEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.\n\n(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)\n\nTHE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.\n\nLYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.\n\n(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!\n\n(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)\n\nZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?\n\nLYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way.

Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth?

Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.)

And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!\n\nBLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!\n\nBELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.\n\nBELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.\n\nLYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.\n\nZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering.

Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter.

R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands.

They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place.

He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand!

(His features grow drawn and grey and old.)\n\n\nBLOOM (At the window.) What?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on!

After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter.

Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour!

Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them!

You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl.

Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.)

I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 15, "api_path": "/songs/2823530", "artist_names": "Paramount Pictures", "full_title": "Forrest Gump by\u00a0Paramount\u00a0Pictures", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5795338093963dfd87634766824c8778.300x400x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5795338093963dfd87634766824c8778.300x400x1.jpg", "id": 2823530, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1470805, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1545270149, "path": "/Paramount-pictures-forrest-gump-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Paramount-pictures-forrest-gump-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5795338093963dfd87634766824c8778.300x400x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/5795338093963dfd87634766824c8778.300x400x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 15, "hot": false}, "title": "Forrest Gump", "title_with_featured": "Forrest Gump", "updated_by_human_at": 1545270149, "url": "https://genius.com/Paramount-pictures-forrest-gump-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/187502", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/6ce4c5d67dc93668624b4d7bc1c7fbc9.1000x562x1.jpg", "id": 187502, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5117a00898b5f7ed57c403033aa8a234.1000x1000x1.png", "index_character": "p", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Paramount Pictures", "slug": "Paramount-pictures", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Paramount-pictures"}, "artist": "Paramount Pictures", "lyrics": "Forrest Gump LyricsEXT.

So many pounds of\nshrimp to pay off the boat, so many\npounds for gas, we can just live\nright on the boat. We ain't got to\npay no rent. I'll be the captain; we\ncan just work it together.

The question is, how badly do you want it?\n\nMISTY: You work for the department? You a shrink?\n\nKRASNER: I was on the job for 15 years. I left to become a psychologist. I'm with the peer assistance program. I'm a volunteer.\n\nMISTY: Well, how about I volunteer my way out of this chair, tell you to kiss my ass, and talk to my union rep?\nKRASNER: Well, you could do that, sure. But your inspector would guarantee that you'll be at your desk, and the only time you'll see the street is in the parking lot, or if you go to get coffee, or look out the window.\n\nMISTY: This is voluntary, right?\n\nKRASNER: Mmm-hmm.\n\nMISTY: And off the record?\n\nKRASNER: Absolutely.\n\nMISTY: So why are we doing this in an interrogation room?\n\nKRASNER: You'd be more candid at a Starbucks?\n\nMISTY: Really? Mmm Maybe at M&G's, after a shift. Still can't believe that place went out of business.\n\nKRASNER: I miss Copeland's.\n\nMISTY: Who doesn't? Whatever. Let's do this. Detective Mercedes Kelly Knight, badge 3-0-9-3-5.\n\nKRASNER: You know, you're not being recorded.\n\nMISTY: Of course I am. (to the one-way mirror) You know this is bullshit, right? Things got rough with a hostile witness. You think that's the first time this has ever happened?\n\nKrasner writes something down, which makes Misty uncomfortable.\nKRASNER: You lost control. And it's all about control with you, isn't it? I mean, that's why you were a point guard. You wanted to be the one to distribute the ball, right?\n\nMISTY: It's 'cause I was short, and it was the only way I could get on the court, so...\n\nKRASNER: 'Cause you had to play the game.\n\nMISTY: It's not a game for me.\n\nKRASNER: Then why get benched for something as stupid as getting physical with Claire Temple?\n\nKrasner shows Misty a photo of Stryker holding her at gunpoint. Misty instantly flashes back to that moment. The memory is hazy and surreal, unlike her \"Misty-vision\" crime scene recreations.\n\nSTRYKER (echoing): Do you love? Do you love? Hmm? Oh, come on. You're not gonna beg? Oh, come on. Not even a little bit?\n\nMISTY: If you gonna kill me, then just do it.\nMisty blinks and returns to the present. Her lip is trembling.\n\nKRASNER: What shook you? Was it losing your gun to one suspect while trying to arrest another without backup? Was it the extra eyes because of Scarfe? Was it this Luke Cage guy? What pushed you towards career suicide?\n\nMISTY (laughing): You know how many times I've been in this same goddamn box on the other side of the table? You think you are gonna break me? Bring it.\n\nKRASNER: Like I said, this is not an interrogation. I'm not here to break you. You've already done that yourself. The question is, how broken are you? And can you be fixed?\n\nA GARBAGE TRUCK\nLuke wakes up in the back of his garbage truck. He prods gently around his wounds and they make squishing sounds. He climbs out of the truck when it pauses and takes a whiff of himself.\n\nLUKE: Ugh! Sweet Christmas.\n\nOPENING THEME\n\nHARLEM'S PARADISE\nThe Delfonics are rehearsing.\n\nLEAD SINGER: Hold up, hold up. Somebody ain't playing that thing right. Tighten up over here. Tighten up over here, all right? Let's do this, man. We rehearsed it. Let's get this done.\n\nThey go into \"Stop and Look (And You Have Found Love\"\n\nIn the office above the club Shades is looking down through the newly replaced window.\n\nSHADES: So we've checked every truck, every landfill in every borough. And for all of that, we've got...\n\nZIP: Nothing yet.\n\nSHADES: Nothing yet. Nothing yet...\n\nSTRYKER: Y'all can't find Luke Cage? What, he just dissipated? Like smoke? See, that's the thing. Where there's smoke, there's fire.\n\nStryker pulls a finger gun out of his inside pocket. He points it around and pulls the imaginary trigger. A real gunshot rings out. He'd taken out his gun at hip level and shot Darnell while people were distracted by his finger gun.\n\nDownstairs the rehearsing magicians scatter.\n\nSTRYKER: There's nothing magical about it. Follow the smoke. Or the damn garbage truck.\n\nZip, Sugar, and Darnell leave.\n\nSHADES: Well you ain't Houdini.\n\nSTRYKER: And you ain't Rick from Casablanca, neither. What? You thought you could whisper in Mariah's ear have her do your dirty work then you're the new king with the big desk? Hmm Biggie photo...Delfonics crooning downstairs...You killed my friend, Shades. He was my number one seller. Who do you think gave him that Barron Claiborne there?\n\nSHADES: You don't have any friends.\n\nSTRYKER: \"A man of too many friends comes to ruin, but there is a friend who comes closer than a brother.\" Proverbs 18:24. Cornell Stokes was that friend for me. And I could trust him like I could my own brother.\n\nSHADES: Cornell was losing it. You trusted me to take care of him.\n\nSTRYKER: I trusted you to take care of it, not him. What? Did you think I was just gonna give it all to you? Give me one reason why I shouldn't splatter this pristine desk with your brain matter.\n\nZIP: Because it won't help you find Luke Cage any faster?\n\nSHADES: You're smarter than your name implies, Zip. Two rule books got me through the darkness.\nThe Bible and The 48 Laws of Power. Do you want to know what the 49th is? \"Luke Cage ain't dead until you find his goddamn body.\"\n\nTHE STREETS OF HARLEM\nLuke is limping through the streets. He comes across a laundromat and stumbles into it. He takes some clothes at random out of a dryer and puts them on.\n\nMEGAN MCLAREN (on TV): And today's top news, the shootout that occurred in Harlem last night. After an ambulance was forced off the street, it appears a chase led to a women's clinic where gunfire was exchanged. The fight continued to this historic theater where severe damage was wrought. Witnesses described two men at the center of this fight.\n\nAt this point Luke notices the news.\n\nMEGAN: Although police still have not detained any suspects, this man, Luke Cage, is wanted for questioning in connection with the recent murder of noted nightlife mogul Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes.\n\nLuke pulls on a hoodie and hurries out of the laundromat.\nTHE INTERROGATION ROOM\n\nKRASNER: You had it rough recently.\n\nMISTY: Where do you want to start?\n\nKRASNER: Who do you talk to when things get bad?\n\nMISTY: I...I used to talk to Scarfe.\n\nKRASNER: No husband. A boyfriend?\n\nMISTY: The last time somebody set me up, I ended up arresting the guy at the table.\n\nKRASNER: No.\n\nMISTY: Yeah. I did a background check, and he was wanted for robbery in three different states. They gave the dude a nickname at my precinct.\n\nKRASNER: Yeah?\n\nMISTY: Called him the \"Love Bandit.\" I still get shit about it. I see everything and I forget nothin'. Every investigation, every suspect, every murder, every crying mother It is all in my head.\n\nKRASNER: So who's the last person you dated?\n\nMISTY: That's personal.\n\nKRASNER: That's why we're here.\n\nMISTY: I met a guy at a bar. I wasn't nice to him, at all...But he didn't care. He was funny. He wasn't wearing a ring. And the first time he spoke to me, even in a low cut dress, he looked at my eyes not my breasts.\n\nKRASNER: So?\n\nMISTY: So, we talked. I could be myself. He thought I was pretty and he told me so. We had coffee.\n\nQuick cut to Misty and Luke having sex.\n\nKRASNER: I feel a \"but\" coming on.\n\nMISTY: But he wasn't who I thought he was.\n\nKRASNER: Just like Scarfe? How does that make you feel?\n\nMISTY: How do you think it makes me feel?\n\nFLASHBACK\nCottonmouth crashes through his office window. Mariah attacks him with the mic stand.\n\nMARIAH: I didn't want it!\n\nQuick cut to\nSPURLOCK'S MORTUARY\nwhere Mariah is standing over Cottonmouth's body.\n\nMARIAH: You don't remember Jazmine. How could you? She was fly. So damn fast. She used to drive Mama Mabel crazy with all her boyfriends. Malik was special, though. He was talented. Played drums on a lot of those Sugar Hill Records. The old ones. I really liked him. I thought they were good together. Mama Mabel couldn't stand him. She knew he was dabbling. Coke, smack. Malik wanted you, Cornell. He did. But he OD'd. And then Jazzy ran off. She told me, \"I'm not ready to be nobody's mama.\" And she just left. She left you, and there you were, wrapped in a blanket in a basket. Mama Mabel put you in my hands that very day. You always thought I called you \"Mo\" for \"Cottonmouth.\" Mo was for \"Moses.\"\n\nShades slowly opens the door. Mariah doesn't notice him.\n\nMARIAH: I wasn't ready to be nobody's mama, neither. I did try to protect you from...all the shit. I tried I tried to protect you from yourself but I didn't. I'm...\n\nThe door creaks and Mariah quickly tries to gather herself.\n\nSHADES: You did what you had to do.\n\nMARIAH: I don't know how this happened.\n\nSHADES: You made a choice...and now we have to pay the price. Diamondback is here to collect.\n\nMARIAH: Diamond-what?\n\nSHADES: He's not happy that Cornell is dead, and Luke Cage is still alive. Cage is in the wind right now, and I need your help to find him. Our frame doesn't work if he's not there to take the blame.\n\nMARIAH: What, you want me to call the police?\n\nSHADES: If it comes to that, sure. But right now we have more pressing concerns.\n\nMARIAH: You keep saying \"we.\"\n\nSHADES: Well, you. Like it or not the business is yours now.\n\nMARIAH: I have nothing to do with all of that.\n\nSHADES: You are the face now. And nature abhors a vacuum. You have to ensure a smooth transition for all of Cornell's clients, or it is going to be straight up chaos for you.\n\nTHE STREETS OF HARLEM\nDash cam view from a police car of Luke stumbling in the street.\n\nOFFICER: Dispatch, car 77-0-5. Sighting possible drunk. Should we engage?\n\nDISPATCHER: Is it our suspect?\n\nOFFICER: We've a black male, but need verification.\n\nThey sound their sirens to get Luke's attention. He reluctantly stops walking as they get out of their car.\nLUKE: Good morning. Is there a problem?\n\nOFFICER: No. You tell me.\nWhat's your name, son?\n\nLUKE: I'm just taking a walk. Minding my business.\n\nOFFICER: I need to see some ID.\n\nLUKE: To walk?\n\nOFFICER: Turn around, take down your hoodie.\n\nLUKE: May I ask why?\n\nOFFICER: Because I said so.\n\nOne of the officers pulls up a photo of Luke on his phone. They both draw their guns.\n\nOFFICER: Oh, shit. It is him!\n\nOFFICER: On the ground, now! Hands behind your back. Get on the ground, now!\n\nLUKE: I'm really sorry, guys.\n\nOFFICER: You're under arrest!\n\nLuke slaps the officer trying to cuff him, then turns around to protect him from his partner's gunfire. Luke then turns on shooter while he's trying to reload and pushes him so hard he flies through the air and crashes into the hood of his car. The dash cam caught it all. Luke pulls the officers to the sidewalk and steals their car.\nTHE INTERROGATION ROOM\nMisty is falling asleep on the table. Krasner comes back in with two cans of lemonade.\n\nKRASNER: Lemonade? Popular drink.\n\nMISTY: And it still is. That story in my file, too?\n\nKRASNER: What story? You know, I don't believe everything I read? I wanna hear you tell it.\n\nMISTY: Summer of '95, and every other car was playing either \"Shook Ones\" or \"Ice Cream.\" I was hanging out with my cousin, Cassandra. My mother told us never to walk around the neighborhood by ourselves but it was hot, and I was thirsty. And she was taking way too long talking to some cute boy. So I went to Ruiz Bodega by myself and got a lemonade. When I got back, she was gone. It took the cops two weeks to find her body. Disfigured, beaten. The boy, Mike Jones, ran a train on her with his crew. Nobody snitched. Cops didn't push. They didn't really give a shit. She was just another poor, worthless bitch from the Polo Grounds.\n\nKRASNER: So that's why you became a cop?\n\nMISTY: I apply foot to ass, and match lead for lead. I put murderers in handcuffs. I don't just seek justice, I stalk it. And that much should go in my record.\n\nKRASNER: With your resume, you could've been downtown years ago. Hell, you could've been a fed, but you chose to stay in Harlem.\n\nMISTY: I know this place, I know the players and I can make a difference here.\n\nKRASNER: Or use some of those old school connections to make a little money on the side, like your partner.\n\nMISTY: I didn't know anything about Scarfe. Or anything he was doing. He didn't buy new clothes, no new watch, no new girlfriend, no loose talk, nothing.\n\nKRASNER: But he'd been working for Cottonmouth for years.\n\nMISTY: And I trusted him so I didn't see it. And neither did anybody else in this damn department. So why do I get singled out for it?\n\nKRASNER: Because you were the closest to him. It's written all over your face. Not seeing it bothered you, didn't it?\n\nMISTY (sarcastically): 'Cause seeing is my thing, right? That's what made me such a good point guard. 'Cause I could see everything in my head. I knew exactly where people were gonna be, so I put the ball right where it needed to go.\n\nKRASNER: But you couldn't see Scarfe for what he was. Or were you blinded by your emotions?\n\nMISTY: You wouldn't say that if I was a man.\n\nKRASNER: Oh, that is not true.\n\nMISTY: Bullshit! Male cops can screw cop groupies in the back of their unmarked or their RMP, and you guys cheer. They get drunk and fight each other in the parking lot, and it's called blowing off steam. There's always a double standard.\n\nKRASNER: And you never screwed anyone that you shouldn't have while you were on the job?\n\nMISTY: No.\n\nKRASNER: But you choked out a witness. Own your shit. You went renegade when you went after Luke Cage alone. And it got way deeper than it should have. And this guy took the control away from you when he took your gun.\n\nAnother quick, shaky flashback to Stryker holding the gun to Misty's head.\n\nKRASNER: Then you're in a room alone with Miss Temple, and she insults you, and you lost control and you know it.\n\nMISTY: I need a break.\n\nShe gets up and leaves the room, tries to catch her breath in the hallway.\nCOLON'S GYM\nRepairs are underway to get the place back up after Luke's visit. Mariah picks her way through the chaos.\n\nMARIAH: What happened in here? You know what happened here.\n\nDOMINGO: Same as you. Sorry to hear about Cornell. Hope they get that bastard. He's bad for business.\n\nMARIAH: Well, yeah, I'm not here to talk about Luke Cage.\n\nDOMINGO: Well, it took a lot for you to walk through those doors without your people.\n\nMARIAH: Chico, please. I was from around here long before you even knew what that was. Besides, we all contribute to this city, one way or another.\n\nDOMINGO: \"Contribute?\" I never trusted your cousin and I trust you even less. Pretending to rise to the right side of the law. Girl, I know where you're from. That stank don't come off too easy.\n\nMARIAH: The thing my cousin built needs to continue.\n\nDOMINGO: And you're gonna be the one to run it?\n\nMARIAH: No. I need help.\n\nDOMINGO: Me?\n\nMARIAH: Not just you. Cornell had steady customers.\n\nDOMINGO: Not everybody liked your cousin. I mean, God respect the dead.\n\nMARIAH: Yeah, he got it done without a lot of needless violence. I want everybody to come to the table so I can discuss a transition. Maybe even a buyout.\n\nDOMINGO: There was something dangerous behind your eyes and this is it, huh?\n\nMARIAH: Cornell was who he was. I want something different. I don't want to have to look over my shoulder, Domingo. Gather all the bosses. I have a proposition that will benefit us all. So who gets an invitation?\n\nDOMINGO: Jacques Alef with the Macoute, Neville Barnwell with the Yardies. Juan Carlos Castro with the Cubanos. And the Chinese, they got their own thing going on downtown, but Peter Hong with the Koreans he might wanna holla.\n\nMARIAH: When?\n\nDOMINGO: Oh, that's gonna take me a few days.\n\nMARIAH: Tonight.\n\nSOLEDAD'S DINER\nClaire is researching in a booth. She searches \"elastic skin cells\" then emphasizes \"abalone shells\" in her notes.\n\nCLAIRE: Abalone shells...\n\nShe plugs in the flash drive Luke gave her. It's all encrypted so she can't read it, but she searches \"Seagate Burstein\" based on file titles.\n\nLuke comes in to sit next to her. Blood is seeping through to stain his hoodie.\n\nLUKE: Claire. Claire.\n\nCLAIRE: Everybody's looking for you. How did you not get caught?...He shot you again?\n\nShe quickly checks his new bullet wound.\n\nCLAIRE: Ugh! Why in the hell is this guy trying to kill you so bad? He's even going through the trouble of using bullets that could actually do it.\n\nLUKE: Willis was my, uh, my best friend. He's...He's delusional. Delusional and pissed.\n\nCLAIRE: Let me see...Ugh, your wound is getting infected, this looks bad. Who are you?\n\nLUKE: What do you mean?\n\nCLAIRE: I should say, \"What are you?\" I'm looking at your cells and I've never seen anything like it. I've been looking up sea shells to better understand the structure of your skin. Like I said you're amazing.\n\nLUKE: Only one man knows the science. And I am not going back to prison.\n\nCLAIRE: Is his name Dr. Noah Burstein? You gave me Reva's hard drive, remember? Do you talk to him?\n\nLUKE: No. Reva kept tabs just in case someone got cute. But I am not ready to reopen that door.\n\nCLAIRE: I don't think that you have very much choice. We need to get you out of here. My mom has a car. And we haven't totaled that one yet.\n\nMARIAH'S BROWNSTONE\nMariah is zoning out, looking at family photos.\n\nALEX: Excuse me. Excuse me? Madam Councilwoman?\n\nMARIAH: Not anymore.\n\nALEX: Have you seen the emails? The interview requests? Even Thembi Wallace wants another sit-down.\n\nMARIAH: Never.\n\nALEX: Can I show you something? Hit the news about 20 minutes ago. He attacked two cops and stole their cars.\n\nMARIAH: Cage?\n\nALEX: The cops are alive. They GPS'd the car, but someone leaked the footage. It was too hot to hold back.\n\nAlex shows Mariah the dash cam footage on a tablet.\n\nMARIAH: Huh. It's amazing.\n\nALEX: I know it's tough seeing the man that killed your cousin.\n\nMARIAH: They'll get him, Alex. Justice will prevail. You know, Cornell taught me to be strong, so I will be strong.\n\nALEX: People understand the threat...the kind of person you're up against. They're not talking about the money, or where it came from. I think if you play this right, you could have supporters with even deeper pockets behind you, who see this as a political issue, and see your cousin as a brave man who stood up to a freak.\n\nMARIAH: You would use my personal tragedy for strategic political advantage?\n\nALEX: Madam Councilwoman, I...\n\nMARIAH: I taught you well. Go home, Alex. I'm letting you off early.Thank you.\n\nTHE INTERROGATION ROOM\nMisty reenters the room, ready to start again.\n\nKRASNER: What happened out there that bothers you the most?\n\nMISTY: I lost my gun. Other than that, I wouldn't say it bothered me.\n\nKRASNER: I saw your hand shake the first time you looked at this photo. Why?\n\nMISTY: Because I remembered seeing myself see myself wondering what I would look like in a casket. I mean, how the hell did I get there? He got the drop on me. How in the hell did he do that? I could have disarmed him, like, ten different ways. Why didn't I do any of that? I couldn't help anybody, not even my damn self. He shoved my gun in my face and I froze. And you know what I thought about? I thought about Pop's funeral. I thought about my own funeral. I thought about my father, and what people would think about me. And this guy this guy was smiling...while he was toying with my life. It was fun for him. I didn't have control, and maybe I never did. And when Claire was talking sideways about me, all I wanted to do was take my control back....Oh, my God. What have I done?\n\nKRASNER: It's like anything else you've learned on the job. It's ugly but you can't move your gaze. You have to look and learn.\nThat's how you get answers. That's how you win.\n\nWe see Ridley watching this exchange through the one way mirror.\nON THE ROAD TO GEORGIA\nClaire is driving; Luke is in the passenger seat. He's grunting and suffering, so Claire holds his hand.\n\nLUKE: It's getting harder to breathe...These wounds are kicking my ass.\n\nCLAIRE: Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know, it passed before, it's gonna pass again, okay? I promise.\n\nLUKE: Can I get that with the money-back guarantee?\n\nCLAIRE: Breathe. See? You got this.\n\nLUKE:What if this is a one-way trip?\n\nCLAIRE: Hey, hey, you are gonna make it. You hear me? You're gonna make it just fine. We're gonna fix this. Don't even. You're not dying in my mom's car, okay?\n\nLUKE: It's the part you can't fix that's bothering me.\n\nCLAIRE: What do you mean?\n\nLUKE: Willis. Willis Stryker. He thinks he's my brother. Diamondback. He's...he's gotta be lying about my father. He...he can't be my brother.\n\nBURSTEIN'S FARMHOUSE\nClaire leaves Luke in the front seat and goes up to ring Burstein's doorbell. Burstein only opens the door a crack.\n\nCLAIRE: Hi. Sorry to ring so late. My name is Sandra Lopez. I'm currently majoring in prison studies at Boston University, and, uh, I was just wondering if I could ask you a few questions about your time at Seagate. My friend said that you worked there?\n\nBURSTEIN: Your friend was mistaken....what friend?\n\nCLAIRE: Carl Lucas.\n\nBURSTEIN: I don't know anybody by that name.\n\nHe tries to close the door. Claire catches it and shoves it open.\n\nCLAIRE: He's alive, Doc.\n\nBURSTEIN: That's impossible.\n\nCLAIRE: Your experiment worked. It changed him.\n\nBURSTEIN: Changed how?\n\nCLAIRE: You should see for yourself.\n\nBURSTEIN: He's here?\n\nCLAIRE: Yes.\n\nBURSTEIN: Where is he?\n\nClaire leads him over to her car.\n\nLUKE: What's up, Doc? I've always wanted to say that.\n\nBURSTEIN: Let's get him out of here\n\nThe two struggle to help him inside.\n\nBURSTEIN: Put him on the couch.\n\nCLAIRE: Come on, just a few more steps...easy, easy. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy. Breathe. Breathe. Okay.\n\nBURSTEIN: You've got no scars. Nothing. That lab was totally destroyed. You mean it worked?\n\nLUKE: Yes and no. Until last night...I was bulletproof.\n\nBURSTEIN: Jesus Christ, kid. What did this to you?\n\nLUKE: They shot me with some crazy bullets.\n\nCLAIRE: They exploded inside of him.\n\nBURSTEIN: He should be dead.\n\nLUKE: My skin is now tough like armor.\n\nCLAIRE: I think maybe what makes him stronger is also pushing the shrapnel deeper into his organs. Trust me, it is impossible to cut into his skin.\n\nBURSTEIN: Look, I don't know what it is that you think I can do for you. My lab is not my lab anymore. I wouldn't know where to begin.\n\nCLAIRE: What if we can help you with that? Reva took this.\n\nShe holds up the flash drive.\n\nBURSTEIN: She shouldn't have done that.\n\nLUKE: Can you unlock it?\n\nBurstein takes it over to his laptop and enters a password. It works.\n\nBURSTEIN: Oh, my God. It's all here. Everything.\n\nCLAIRE: Everything you need?\n\nBURSTEIN: Everything I lost. So much more. Reva died for this, didn't she?\n\nCLAIRE: Luke refuses to talk about it...You okay?\n\nLuke coughs up blood.\n\nLUKE: They're killing me. Doc, you figure this shit out.\n\nThey help him out of the house and into\nBURSTEIN'S BARN\nThe barn is full of jerry-rigged machinery.\n\nLUKE: What is all this stuff?\n\nBURSTEIN: During the cover-up, I stole whatever I could.\n\nLUKE: What cover-up?\n\nBURSTEIN: They couldn't advertise Rackham's death, or the explosion that supposedly killed you, or Reva's data dump, so they they killed the whole thing...Here, let's set him down...I was so close to a breakthrough. That all ended when they thought you were dead. I started again from scratch, but never came close to replicating the Seagate incident.\n\nBurstein goes to unzip Luke's hoodie. Claire takes over for him.\n\nCLAIRE: I'm a nurse. I know the drill. I can help.\n\nLUKE: Why me? Why did you pick me? Because you were strong. Stronger than most.\n\nLUKE: That's not what Reva said. She said she begged you to do it.\n\nBURSTEIN: There's more to it than that, and you know it. She begged me, but you were already tabbed for the program.  Didn't Reva tell you about this?\n\nLUKE: No.\n\nBurstein approaches Luke with a scalpel.\n\nCLAIRE: That's not gonna do anything.\n\nBurstein breaks the scalpel against Luke's skin. Claire rolls her eyes.\n\nBURSTEIN: Oh, my God...Look, I gotta get a blood sample to cross check with Reva's data. Your DNA may be the X factor that made this whole thing work.\n\nCLAIRE: You mean, it could only work for Luke?\n\nBURSTEIN: Yeah, maybe. This wound is too septic to get a decent sample.\n\nCLAIRE: Are you saying you can't recreate what you did?\n\nBURSTEIN: It's not as straightforward as that. You know, penicillin, the X-ray machine [groans] [Burstein] the smallpox vaccine, pacemaker, even even even Viagra. Those were accidents. It's the same with Carl.\nClaire starts rifling through Burstein's equipment while he stands around.\n\nCLAIRE: This could work. If you go down his throat...\n\nBURSTEIN: We can puncture his mucus membrane.\n\nCLAIRE: Exactly.\n\nBURSTEIN: I like the way you think.\n\nLUKE: I don't.\n\nCLAIRE: Sorry.\n\nBURSTEIN: All right. Put your head back. Just open your mouth. I'll try to make this quick.\n\nCLAIRE: Breathe through your nose.\n\nBurstein pushes the needle into Luke's mouth and down his throat. He groans as blood starts to flow through the tube as Claire draws out the plunger of a large syringe.\n\nBURSTEIN: Easy, easy. Oh, here we go. It's working.\n\nTHE INTERROGATION ROOM\nRidley places Misty's shield on the table between them.\n\nRIDLEY: You see that?\n\nMISTY: That's my shield.\n\nRIDLEY: No, no, no. That's not your shield. That shield belongs to the city of New York and its people. And when you lose control, go upside somebody's head because you had a bad day or you feel powerless... r you screw the wrong person...\n\nMISTY: I didn't screw anybody!\n\nRIDLEY: Come on, now. You don't deserve to represent the people of New York, let alone protect them.\n\nMISTY: That's not true and you know it.\n\nRIDLEY: I do.\n\nMISTY: Look, we're wired differently. We run towards gunfire. We drink when we're sad. We screw when we're mad. And people hate us until they need us. And I hate that. But I love it, too.\n\nRIDLEY: We walk a higher path. It's not simple. It's very hard. And that is why people will always need us.\nShe pulls out a tablet and plays the dash cam video.\n\nRIDLEY: Hero of Harlem, my ass.\n\nMISTY: Look, if we're talking about a right path, it's not just about Luke Cage. You haven't even acknowledged the guy that held a gun to my head last night.\n\nRIDLEY: We will find out who that is.\n\nMISTY: And we still need to talk about Mariah Dillard. She is not innocent in all this.\n\nRIDLEY: Look, Mariah's not on the run for murder, assaulting two police officers. I need you to focus on bringing in Luke Cage.\n\nMISTY: Bullets bounce right off of him. Reason is the only thing that's gonna work. And it has to come from somebody he trusts.\n\nRidley laughs for a moment, then pushes Misty's shield and gun towards her.\n\nRIDLEY: Go get him.\n\nCOLON'S GYM\nShades stops Mariah just inside the door.\n\nSHADES: You ready for this?\n\nMARIAH: Like I said, ready as ever.\n\nSHADES: You need to understand where you are here. If they sense any weakness, any hesitation you're not just done politically you're done permanently.\n\nDOMINGO: You're late.\n\nMARIAH: I'm not. Looks like I'm right on time.\n\nJAMAICAN BOSS: Wagwan?\n\nMARIAH: Now that my cousin is gone, I'm making a few changes. I loved my cousin, but I didn't like what he did.\n\nCUBAN BOSS: Until he stopped serving you.\n\nKOREAN BOSS: Cut the crap, lady. What do you want to tell us?\n\nMARIAH: I'm out. My family is no longer to be associated with what you all do. I need to move in a more legitimate direction.\n\nHAITIAN BOSS: Need? That's a weak hand you're playing.\n\nMARIAH: My cousin has valuable assets and connections. I'll give them to you for a price.\n\nHAITIAN BOSS: And you walk away?\n\nMARIAH: I walk away.\n\nKOREAN BOSS: Why do I find that hard to believe?\n\nSTRYKER (emerging from the shadows): Because you're smart and stupid at the same time.\n\nHAITIAN BOSS: Diamondback, what are you doing here?\n\nSTRYKER: You invited me by not inviting me.\n\nKOREAN BOSS:  Excuse me?\n\nSTRYKER: Now, Peter when you don't buy my wares, or Jacques when you get them at a cheaper price from my competitors, you're messing with my money. And that pisses me off.\n\nStryker shoots the Korean boss in the head, then throws a knife between the Haitian boss's eyes.\n\nSTRYKER: Anybody else not made it to confessional this week? Your men outside are dead. Your greed superseded your common sense. So now, I have the pulpit. Rich men, camel and needles.\n\nDOMINGO: What do you want?\n\nSTRYKER: Hey, Neville, if you wanna test me...\n\nJAMAICAN BOSS: Ease up, man. I got no hackle with you now.\n\nCUBAN BOSS: We'll listen what you have to say.\n\nSTRYKER: Don't bother. Just by being here, you're already dead.\n\nStryker shoots the Jamaican boss through the throat. The bullet keeps going and kills the Cuban boss.\n\nSTRYKER: Two for the price of one.\n\nDOMINGO: What are you doing, man? You're gonna start a war.\n\nSTRYKER: \"And then many will fall away, and they will betray each other and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. But the one who endures to the end he will be saved.\"\n\nDOMINGO: You're crazy.\n\nSTRYKER: Crazy would be leaving you alive to run a very profitable drug business. But I got no beef with your cousins down south of the border so today is your lucky day.\n\nStryker turns on Mariah\n\nSTRYKER: But you? You! you're full of crazy. I just killed four people, and you didn't even flinch.\n\nMARIAH: You don't scare me.\n\nSTRYKER: No, I don't think I do. Tell me why we should be friends.\n\nMARIAH: Luke Cage. Clearly, we both have issues with him.\n\nSTRYKER: I heard he killed your cousin. Allegedly. Rest assured, I will end him when the time is right.\n\nMARIAH: But the time is not right. Have you even seen the dashboard footage that's all over the news? You don't you see the opportunity? You see a man you want dead who won't die. I see a marketer's dream. Why spend all your time killing and intimidating your criminal customers in the dark when you should be selling guns to police departments in the light? Guns that can handle these new threats.\n\nSTRYKER: Go on.\n\nMARIAH: Word is you have a weapon that can take him down. Kill Luke Cage. But if you do, and you go big, everyone else will come to you to help take down the rest of these super-freaks that are upsetting the natural order of things. You gotta go big pharma on this shit. You invent the disease, then you sell the cure.\n\nSTRYKER: Oh, Shades, now I see you were right. I like how she thinks. And who better to broker the deals, hmm?\n\nMARIAH: No. No, I'm out of this.\n\nSTRYKER: No. You're in way into this until I decide otherwise. Domingo. Sorry about the mess, hermano. But I have no doubt you have people that can clean up.\n\nDOMINGO: Why am I still alive, man?\n\nSTRYKER: 'Cause no one's coming at me. They'll ask around, so tell 'em I'll murderize everything in sight. 'Cause I don't care and I won't quit. You can't bargain with me. You buy or you die...You think Peter Luger's is still open?\nShades follows Diamondback out. Mariah sits down.\nHARLEM'S PARADISE\nThe Delfonics are performing again, this time in front of a big crowd.\n\nStryker is in the VIP area watching the performance.\n\nSHADES: That footage of Cage and the cops? It went viral. What do you want to do about it?\n\nSTRYKER: That's great...That's great. He's got nowhere to run now. We'll find him. It's all coming together.\n\nSHADES: But there's gonna be a...\n\nSTRYKER: Shh! I like this song.\n\nMisty is back at her desk. She clears her entire photo wall, replacing it with a few pictures of Luke, Cottonmouth, and Stryker.\nBURSTEIN'S FARMHOUSE\nLuke is sleeping, or unconscious. Claire strokes his head when Burstein isn't looking.\n\nBURSTEIN: We were working on creating this artificial skin for burn victims. We used a process called CRISPR to fuse the subject's DNA with another DNA to gain its attributes.\n\nCLAIRE: The foreign DNA was abalone shell, wasn't it?\n\nBURSTEIN: Uh, yeah. Where did you do your residency?\n\nCLAIRE: 145th Street. Um, and my fellowship in Hell's Kitchen.\n\nBURSTEIN: Well, you're correct. We already used abalone to build better combat equipment for soldiers. And to genetically enhance the durability, pliability, and healing properties of human epidermis.\n\nCLAIRE: Okay, so why are these bullets penetrating his skin then? Are they dipped in something?\n\nBURSTEIN: Well, perhaps. But more likely because of what they were made from. You see, uh, abalone is nearly impenetrable, but\nits stacked plates can be pushed apart under the right circumstances.\n\nLuke wakes and sits up. Claire immediately goes to his side.\n\nLUKE: Like what?\n\nCLAIRE: Hey.\n\nBURSTEIN: During the experiment, your skin cells were bonded with hydrogen covalent bonds at the exact point of acidity, temperature and saline concentration...\n\nLUKE: English, please.\n\nBURSTEIN: Well, see, I can replicate exactly the acidity and the saline portions of the experiment with the information that's on the Reva drive that you brought. But the the wild card is the temperature. Because of what Albert Rackham did, turning up the heat on the bath, I have no gauge as to the temperature that catalyzed the experiment.\n\nLUKE: How are you going to get this stuff out of me?\n\nBURSTEIN: Right. Uh...Imagine that your skin works like a form of Velcro, uh, under a sort of lock and key.\n\nCLAIRE: And in order to cut through it, he's got to weaken the lock and key, so we can remove the shrapnel.\n\nLUKE: How do you plan to do that?\n\nBURSTEIN: Uh, I'm going to dip your skin in boiling acid, and then, uh, remove the shrapnel. What? I've tried it with animals.\n\nLUKE:: He's putting me in a rotisserie spit?\n\nCLAIRE: Um...I think he wants to deep fry you. Like a turkey.\n\nBurstein flips some taps to start filling the bath.\n\nBURSTEIN: Now, look, we're only gonna have a short window to do this, uh, before your skin closes up again.\n\nLUKE: Just so we're clear, what could go wrong?\n\nBURSTEIN: Well, your your skin could peel off like wax paper, and, uh, after about ten seconds, you'd beg me to put a bullet in your head because the pain would be so bad. But your your head looks fine, so I I guess the bullet would ricochet off your skull.\n\nCut to a little while later. They're getting ready to submerge Luke.\n\nLUKE: Sweet Christmas.\n\nCLAIRE: If the procedure gets too painful, just raise your hand in a fist and I'll shut it down, okay?\n\nLUKE: Like this?\n\nCLAIRE: Right on.\n\nThey check that Burstein isn't listening.\n\nLUKE: You trust this dude?\n\nCLAIRE: Hell no.\n\nLUKE: If anything happens to me, if anything goes wrong, make sure he doesn't keep Reva's data. It cannot fall into the wrong hands. I don't care if you have to kill him.\n\nCLAIRE: I got you. But let's not go there, okay?\n\nLUKE: I'm serious. It's too dangerous. We can't have guys like me running around on every corner.\n\nCLAIRE: What are you talking about? There's nobody like you.\n\nBURSTEIN: All right, let's go.\n\nCLAIRE: Okay, okay.\n\nThey put a breathing apparatus over Luke's face.\n\nCLAIRE: Good? Okay.\n\nBURSTEIN: Good.\n\nThey lift the bed-thing holding Luke and start lowering it into the boiling acid.\n\nBURSTEIN: Keep your hands clear.\n\nCLAIRE: Yeah.\n\nBURSTEIN: All right. Down. Hang in there. It's going to be okay.\n\nLuke starts to scream as soon as it touches his skin.\n\nCLAIRE: How long do we keep him down?\n\nBURSTEIN: I don't know. Just have to let the acid do its work.\n\nCLAIRE: Now?\n\nBURSTEIN: Not yet.\n\nThe machine monitoring his vitals flashes a warning for cardiac distress. Claire starts to raise Luke out.\n\nBURSTEIN: What are you doing? He's not ready yet. All right. Hold on.\n\nThey try a scalpel on his skin but it breaks.\n\nBURSTEIN: Damn it. Dip him again.\n\nCLAIRE: What?\n\nBURSTEIN: Again! Again!\n\nCLAIRE: One more.\n\nThe monitor sounds another warning.\n\nCLAIRE: We're losing him.\n\nBURSTEIN: It's not working. Why isn't it working?\n\nCLAIRE: We're losing him!\n\nBURSTEIN: It's not working!\n\nCLAIRE:  What do we do?\n\nBURSTEIN: I don't know.\n\nThe monitor makes the \"flatlining\" sound. Luke's hand lifts out of the acid and makes a fist.\n\nCLAIRE: Shit!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1729946", "artist_names": "The Big Bopper", "full_title": "Little Red Riding Hood by\u00a0The\u00a0Big Bopper", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/a7deaec0ace2de8214fe123587437744.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a7deaec0ace2de8214fe123587437744.999x999x1.jpg", "id": 1729946, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429906300, "path": "/The-big-bopper-little-red-riding-hood-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/The-big-bopper-little-red-riding-hood-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1959, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1959", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1959", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/a7deaec0ace2de8214fe123587437744.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a7deaec0ace2de8214fe123587437744.999x999x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Little Red Riding Hood", "title_with_featured": "Little Red Riding Hood", "updated_by_human_at": 1565696017, "url": "https://genius.com/The-big-bopper-little-red-riding-hood-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/359554", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/df6cd96cebcac7b15e6db1f05aae8ee1.1000x313x1.jpg", "id": 359554, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9161d6ede86aa846af7a2d063a67a6c2.695x695x1.jpg", "index_character": "b", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "The Big Bopper", "slug": "The-big-bopper", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-big-bopper"}, "artist": "The Big Bopper", "lyrics": "Little Red Riding Hood LyricsWho's that I see walkin' in these woods?\nWhy it's Little Red Ridin' Hood\nHey there Little Red Riding Hood\nYou sure are lookin' good\nYou're everything a big bad wolf could want\nListen to me, Little Red Ridin' Hood\nI don't think little big girls should\nGo walkin' in these spooky old woods alone\n\nWhat big eyes you have\nThe kind of eyes that drive wolves mad\nSo, just to see that you don't get chased\nI think I ought, to walk, with you for a ways\nWhat full lips you have\nThey're sure to lure, someone bad\nSo, untill you get to grandma's place\nI think you ought, to walk, with me and be safe\n\nI'm gonna keep my sheep suit on\nTill I'm sure that you've been shown\nThat I can be trusted walkin' with you alone\n\nLittle Red Ridin' Hood\nI'd like to hold you if I could\nBut you might think I'm a big bad wolf, so I won't\n\nWhat a big heart I have\nThe better to love you with\nLittle Red Ridin' Hood\nEven bad wolves can be good\nI'll try to keep satisfied\nJust to walk close by your side\nMaybe you'll see things my way\nBefore we get to grandma's place\n\nLittle Red Ridin' Hood\nYou sure are lookin' good\nYou're everything a big bad wolf could want\nYou might also likeI mean...

p.3 LyricsCumberland Plateau, Tennessee Valley and\nUnaka Mountains Region -\nBluegrass and String Band Music\n\nBluegrass and string band music has one of the most fiercely loyal audiences in American music.  Followers don't look at it so much as entertainment as they do a way of life.  You'll frequently see the makeup of these bands are family members, and many make it their life's work.  That kind of devotion says a lot about the values they see in the music. Whether it's history and tradition they hear, or that they hear it as a true expression of Americana, the performers and their audiences are passionate. You'll find a great presentation of this in a thesis by Leslie Blake Price entitled Bluegrass Nation: A Historical and Cultural Analysis of America's Truest Music.\n\nAny discussion of country or bluegrass music must acknow-ledge the contributions of the Carter Family.  They were one of the most influential groups in country music history, and they moved the emphasis from hillbilly instrumentals to \"folk stories in song\".  The original group consisted of A.P., his wife Sara, and her sister Maybelle.  They influenced all that followed in country and folk music, from Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Doc Watson all the way up to Bob Dylan, Emmylou Harris and Ketch Secor.\n\nIt's unlikely that bluegrass music would exist today without the Carter Family's contributions. A.P. collected hundreds of Appalachian folk songs and rearranged them into the classics we have today.  They recorded hundreds of songs. but \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\", \"Wildwood Flower\", and \"Keep on the Sunny Side\" will give you a good sense of what their music did to build the folk tradition in country music.\n\nThat foundation work was built-up by those who followed.  In bluegrass, there are no better examples of where we are today today than Earl Skruggs' \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\", the Foggy Mountain Boys' \"Rollin' in My Sweet Baby's Arms\" or the Osborne Brothers' \"Rocky Top\", but here is a short list of more recent (and also great) examples of bluegrass and string music:Old Crow Medicine Show's \"Sweet Amarillo\"The SteelDrivers' \"Wearin' a Hole\"The Grascals' \"Old Friend of Mine\"Dailey & Vincent's \"Take Me Back (And Leave Me There)\"Aly Bain, Jerry Douglas and Russ Barenberg's\n\"St. Anne's Reel\"Wilson Banjo Company's \"95 Years\"Yonder Mountain String Band's \"Alison\"Top Ten Music Shrines in Tennessee\nIf you're into music and history, here are some great places to visit when you're in Tennessee:In the Coastal Plains region:Graceland - Memphis\nElvis promised his parents he'd build them the finest house in town, and put an end to years of struggle. Graceland was the fulfillment of that dream.Sun Studios - Memphis\nJohhny Cash, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis recorded here - all at the same time.Stax American Soul Music Museum - Memphis\nStax made hit soul music in the 50s and 60s, and this is one of only a few museums dedicated to soul.In the Nashville Basin region:Country Music Hall of Fame - Nashville\nThe museum\u2019s core exhibition is \"Sing Me Back Home: A Journey Through Country Music\". It's a full-immersion experience.Ryman Auditorium - Nashville\nThe first Grand Ole Opry started here in 1925. It's almost like being in a cathedral.Johnny Cash Museum - Nashville\nIt's captivating, real and raw - just like Cash himself.Jack Daniel's Distillery - Lynchburg\nWhat, you ask, does Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 have to do with Tennessee music?In the Cumberland/TN Valley/Unaka Mtns region:Cumberland Caverns - McMinnville\nBluegrass concerts are presented every month in the Volcano Room of Cumberland Caverns. They've been featured on NBC and PBS.Dollywood - Pigeon Forge\nThink of it as Disneyland with a bluegrass soundtrack.Birthplace of Country Music Museum - Bristol\nTells the story of the 1927 Bristol Sessions recordings that included the Carter Family and Jimmie RodgersTennessee Artists:Here's a list of some of the most famous musicians that were born in Tennessee or made the state their home. Each artist is listed with one - three songs to give you a sampler of their music. The list is long, but not comprehensive. Think of it as a primer.

"lyrics": "The Trial LyricsHaving told the tale of Lucy Morris to the end, the chronicler must now go back to the more important persons of this history. It was still early in April when Lizzie Eustace was taken down to Scotland by her cousin, and the trial of Mr. Benjamin and Mr. Smiler was fixed to take place at the Central Criminal Court about the middle of May. Early in May the attorneys for the prosecution applied to Greystock, asking him whether he would make arrangements for his cousin's appearance on the occasion, informing him that she had already been formally summon\u0435d. Whereupon he wrot\u0435 to Lizzie, telling her what she had better do, in the kindest manner,\u2014as though there had been no cessation of their friendly intercourse, offering to go with her into court,\u2014and naming an hotel at which he would advise her to stay during the very short time that she need remain in London. She answered this letter at once. She was sorry to say that she was much too ill to travel, or even to think of travelling. Such was her present condition that she doubted greatly whether she would ever again be able to leave the two rooms to which she was at present confined. All that remained to her in life was to watch her own blue waves from the casement of her dear husband's castle,\u2014that casement at which he had loved to sit, and to make herself happy in the smiles of her child. A few months would see the last of it all, and then, perhaps, they who had trampled her to death would feel some pangs of remorse as they thought of her early fate. She had given her evidence once and had told all the truth,\u2014though she was now aware that she need not have done so, as she had been defrauded of a vast amount of property through the gross negligence of the police. She was advised now by persons who seemed really to understand the law, that she could recover the value of the diamonds which her dear, dear husband had given her, from the freeholders of the parish in which the robbery had taken place. She feared that her health did not admit of the necessary exertion. Were it otherwise she would leave no stone unturned to recover the value of her property,\u2014not on account of its value, but because she had been so ill-treated by Mr. Camperdown and the police. Then she added a postscript to say that it was quite out of the question that she should take any journey for the next six months.\n\nThe reader need hardly be told that Greystock did not believe a word of what she said. He felt sure that she was not ill. There was an energy in the letter hardly compatible with illness. But he could not make her come. He certainly did not intend to go down again to Scotland to fetch her,\u2014and even had he done so he could not have forced her to accompany him. He could only go to the attorneys concerned, and read to them so much of the letter as he thought fit to communicate to them. \"That won't do at all,\" said an old gentleman at the head of the firm. \"She has been very leniently treated, and she must come.\"\n\n\"You must manage it, then,\" said Frank.\n\n\"I hope she won't give us trouble, because if she does we must expose her,\" said the second member.\n\n\"She has not even sent a medical certificate,\" said the tyro of the firm, who was not quite so sharp as he will probably become when he has been a member of it for ten or twelve years. You should never ask the ostler whether he greases his oats. In this case Frank Greystock was not exactly in the position of the ostler; but he did inform his cousin by letter that she would lay herself open to all manner of pains and penalties if she disobeyed such a summons as she had received, unless she did so by a very strong medical advice, backed by a medical certificate.\n\nLizzie, when she received this, had two strings to her bow. A writer from Ayr had told her that the summons sent to her was not worth the paper on which it was printed in regard to a resident in Scotland;\u2014and she had also got a doctor from the neighbourhood who was satisfied that she was far too ill to travel up to London. Pulmonary debilitation was the complaint from which she was suffering, which, with depressed vitality in all the organs, and undue languor in all the bodily functions, would be enough to bring her to a speedy end if she so much as thought of making a journey up to London. A certificate to this effect was got in triplicate. One copy she sent to the attorneys, one to Frank, and one she kept herself.\nThe matter was very pressing indeed. It was considered that the trial could not be postponed till the next sitting at the Criminal Court, because certain witnesses in respect to the diamonds had been procured from Hamburg and Vienna, at a very great cost; they were actually on their way to London when Lizzie's second letter was received. Mr. Camperdown had resolved to have the diamonds, still with a hope that they might be restored to the keeping of Messrs. Garnett, there to lie hidden and unused at any rate for the next twenty years. The diamonds had been traced first to Hamburg, and then to Vienna;\u2014and it was to be proved that they were now adorning the bosom of a certain enormously rich Russian princess. From the grasp of the Russian princess it was found impossible to rescue them; but the witnesses who, as it was hoped, might have aided Mr. Camperdown in his efforts, were to be examined at the trial.\n\nA confidential clerk was sent down to Portray, but the confidential clerk altogether failed in making his way into Lizzie's presence. Word was brought to him that nothing but force could take Lady Eustace from her bed-chamber; and that force used to that effect might take her out dead, but certainly not alive. He made inquiry, however, about the doctor, and found that he certainly was a doctor. If a doctor will certify that a lady is dying, what can any judge do, or any jury? There are certain statements which, though they are false as hell, must be treated as though they were true as gospel. The clerk reported, when he got back to London, that, to his belief, Lady Eustace was enjoying an excellent state of health;\u2014but that he was perfectly certain that she would not appear as a witness at the trial.\n\nThe anger felt by many persons as to Lizzie's fraudulent obstinacy was intense. Mr. Camperdown thought that she ought to be dragged up to London by cart ropes. The attorneys engaged for the prosecution were almost beside themselves. They did send down a doctor of their own, but Lizzie would not see the doctor,\u2014would not see the doctor though threats of most frightful consequences were conveyed to her. She would be exposed, fined thousands of pounds, committed to gaol for contempt of court, and prosecuted for perjury into the bargain. But she was firm. She wrote one scrap of a note to the doctor who came from London, \"I shall not live to satisfy their rabid vengeance.\" Even Frank Greystock felt almost more annoyed than gratified that she should be able thus to escape. People who had heard of the inquiry before the magistrate, had postponed their excitement and interest on the occasion, because they knew that the day of the trial would be the great day; and when they heard that they were to be robbed of the pleasure of Lady Eustace's cross-examination, there arose almost a public feeling of wrath that justice should be thus outraged. The doctor who had given the certificate was vilified in the newspapers, and long articles were written as to the impotence of the law. But Lizzie was successful, and the trial went on without her.\n\nIt appeared that though her evidence was very desirable it was not absolutely essential, as, in consequence of her certified illness, the statement which she had made at the police-court could be brought up and used against the prisoners. All the facts of the robbery were, moreover, proved by Patience Crabstick and Billy Cann; and the transfer of the diamonds by Mr. Benjamin to the man who recut them at Hamburg was also proved. Many other morsels of collateral evidence had also been picked up by the police,\u2014so that there was no possible doubt as to any detail of the affair in Hertford Street. There was a rumour that Mr. Benjamin intended to plead guilty. He might, perhaps, have done so had it not been for the absence of Lady Eustace; but as that was thought to give him a possible chance of escape, he stood his ground.\n\nLizzie's absence was a great disappointment to the sight-seers of London, but nevertheless the court was crowded. It was understood that the learned serjeant who was retained on this occasion to defend Mr. Benjamin, and who was assisted by the acute gentleman who had appeared before the magistrate, would be rather severe upon Lady Eustace, even in her absence; and that he would ground his demand for an acquittal on the combined facts of her retention of the diamonds, her perjury, and of her obstinate refusal to come forward on the present occasion. As it was known that he could be very severe, many came to hear him,\u2014and they were not disappointed. The reader shall see a portion of his address to the jury,\u2014which we hope may have had some salutary effect on Lizzie, as she read it in her retreat at Portray, looking out upon her own blue waves.\n\n\"And now, gentlemen of the jury, let me recapitulate to you the history of this lady as far as it relates to the diamonds as to which my client is now in jeopardy. You have heard on the testimony of Mr. Camperdown that they were not hers at all,\u2014that, at any rate, they were not supposed to be hers by those in whose hands was left the administration of her husband's estate, and that when they were first supposed to have been stolen at the inn at Carlisle, he had already commenced legal steps for the recovery of them from her clutches. A bill in Chancery had been filed because she had obstinately refused to allow them to pass out of her hands. It has been proved to you by Lord Fawn that though he was engaged to marry her, he broke his engagement because he supposed her possession of these diamonds to be fraudulent and dishonest.\" This examination had been terrible to the unfortunate Under-Secretary;\u2014and had absolutely driven him away from the India Board and from Parliament for a month. \"It has been proved to you that when the diamonds were supposed to have vanished at Carlisle, she there committed perjury. That she did so she herself stated on oath in that evidence which she gave before the magistrate when my client was committed, and which has, as I maintain, improperly and illegally been used against my client at this trial.\" Here the judge looked over his spectacles and admonished the learned serjeant, that his argument on that subject had already been heard, and the matter decided. \"True, my lord; but my conviction of my duty to my client compels me to revert to it. Lady Eustace committed perjury at Carlisle, having the diamonds in her pocket at the very moment in which she swore that they had been stolen from her. And if justice had really been done in this case, gentlemen, it is Lady Eustace who should now be on her trial before you, and not my unfortunate client. Well,\u2014what is the next that we hear of it? It seems that she brought the diamonds up to London; but how long she kept them there, nobody knows. It was, however, necessary to account for them. A robbery is got up between a young woman who seems to have been the confidential friend rather than the maid of Lady Eustace, and that other witness whom you have heard testifying against himself, and who is, of all the informers that ever came into my hands, the most flippant, the most hardened, the least conscientious, and the least credible. That they two were engaged in a conspiracy I cannot doubt. That Lady Eustace was engaged with them, I will not say. But I will ask you to consider whether such may not probably have been the case. At any rate, she then perjures herself again. She gives a list of the articles stolen from her, and omits the diamonds. She either perjures herself a second time,\u2014or else the diamonds, in regard to which my client is in jeopardy, were not in the house at all, and could not then have been stolen. It may very probably have been so. Nothing more probable. Mr. Camperdown and the managers of the Eustace estate had gradually come to a belief that the Carlisle robbery was a hoax,\u2014and, therefore, another robbery is necessary to account for the diamonds. Another robbery is arranged, and this young and beautiful widow, as bold as brass, again goes before the magistrate and swears. Either the diamonds were not stolen, or else again she commits a second perjury.\n\n\"And now, gentlemen, she is not here. She is sick forsooth at her own castle in Scotland, and sends to us a medical certificate. But the gentlemen who are carrying on the prosecution know their witness, and don't believe a word of her sickness. Had she the feelings of woman in her bosom she ought indeed to be sick unto death. But they know her better, and send down a doctor of their own. You have heard his evidence,\u2014and yet this wonderful lady is not before us. I say again that she ought to be here in that dock,\u2014in that dock in spite of her fortune, in that dock in spite of her title, in that dock in spite of her castle, her riches, her beauty, and her great relatives. A most wonderful woman, indeed, is the widow Eustace. It is she whom public opinion will convict as the guilty one in this marvellous mass of conspiracy and intrigue. In her absence, and after what she has done herself, can you convict any man either of stealing or of disposing of these diamonds?\" The vigour, the attitude, and the indignant tone of the man were more even than his words;\u2014but, nevertheless, the jury did find both Benjamin and Smiler guilty, and the judge did sentence them to penal servitude for fifteen years.\n\nAnd this was the end of the Eustace diamonds as far as anything was ever known of them in England. Mr. Camperdown altogether failed, even in his attempt to buy them back at something less than their value, and was ashamed himself to look at the figures when he found how much money he had wasted for his clients in their pursuit. In discussing the matter afterwards with Mr. Dove, he excused himself by asserting his inability to see so gross a robbery perpetrated by a little minx under his very eyes without interfering with the plunder. \"I knew what she was,\" he said, \"from the moment of Sir Florian's unfortunate marriage. He had brought a little harpy into the family, and I was obliged to declare war against her.\" Mr. Dove seemed to be of opinion that the ultimate loss of the diamonds was upon the whole desirable, as regarded the whole community. \"I should like to have had the case settled as to right of possession,\" he said, \"because there were in it one or two points of interest. We none of us know, for instance, what a man can, or what a man cannot, give away by a mere word.\"\n\n\"No such word was ever spoken,\" said Mr. Camperdown in wrath.\n\n\"Such evidence as there is would have gone to show that it had been spoken. But the very existence of such property so to be disposed of, or so not to be disposed of, is in itself an evil. Thus, we have had to fight for six months about a lot of stones hardly so useful as the flags in the street, and then they vanish from us, leaving us nothing to repay us for our labour.\" All which Mr. Camperdown did not quite understand. Mr. Dove would be paid for his labour,\u2014as to which, however, Mr. Camperdown knew well that no human being was more indifferent than Mr. Dove.\n\nThere was much sorrow, too, among the police. They had no doubt succeeded in sending two scoundrels out of the social world, probably for life, and had succeeded in avoiding the reproach which a great robbery, unaccounted for, always entails upon them. But it was sad to them that the property should altogether have been lost, and sad also that they should have been constrained to allow Billy Cann to escape out of their hands. Perhaps the sadness may have been lessened to a certain degree in the breast of the great Mr. Gager by the charms and graces of Patience Crabstick, to whom he kept his word by making her his wife. This fact,\u2014or rather the prospect of this fact, as it then was,\u2014had also come to the knowledge of the learned serjeant, and, in his hands, had served to add another interest to the trial. Mr. Gager, when examined on the subject, did not attempt to deny the impeachment, and expressed a strong opinion that, though Miss Crabstick had given way to temptation under the wiles of the Jew, she would make an honest and an excellent wife. In which expectation let us trust that he may not be deceived.\n\nAmusement had, indeed, been expected from other sources which failed. Mrs. Carbuncle had been summoned, and Lord George; but both of them had left town before the summons could reach them. It was rumoured that Mrs. Carbuncle, with her niece, had gone to join her husband at New York. At any rate, she disappeared altogether from London, leaving behind her an amount of debts which showed how extremely liberal in their dealings the great tradesmen of London will occasionally be. There were milliners' bills which had been running for three years, and horse-dealers had given her credit year after year, though they had scarcely ever seen the colour of her money. One account, however, she had honestly settled. The hotel-keeper in Albemarle Street had been paid, and all the tribute had been packed and carried off from the scene of the proposed wedding banquet. What became of Lord George for the next six months, nobody ever knew; but he appeared at Melton in the following November, and I do not know that any one dared to ask him questions about the Eustace diamonds.\n\nOf Lizzie, and her future career, something further must be said in the concluding chapters of this work. She has been our heroine, and we must see her through her immediate troubles before we can leave her; but it may be as well to mention here, that although many threats had been uttered against her, not only by Mr. Camperdown and the other attorneys, but even by the judge himself, no punishment at all was inflicted upon her in regard to her recusancy, nor was any attempt made to punish her. The affair was over, and men were glad to avoid the necessity of troubling themselves further with the business. It was said that a case would be got up with the view of proving that she had not been ill at all, and that the Scotch doctor would be subjected to the loss of his degree, or whatever privileges in the healing art belonged to him;\u2014but nothing was done, and Lizzie triumphed in her success.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/777302", "artist_names": "Paul Anka", "full_title": "Midnight by\u00a0Paul\u00a0Anka", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/500a58d2ed7da6dbfb16d7e9ee5a3682.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/500a58d2ed7da6dbfb16d7e9ee5a3682.600x600x1.jpg", "id": 777302, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429193027, "path": "/Paul-anka-midnight-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Paul-anka-midnight-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1958, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1958", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1958", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/500a58d2ed7da6dbfb16d7e9ee5a3682.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/500a58d2ed7da6dbfb16d7e9ee5a3682.600x600x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Midnight", "title_with_featured": "Midnight", "updated_by_human_at": 1644877485, "url": "https://genius.com/Paul-anka-midnight-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/42458", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/7deb5c7c8bca1630de4d1e5eb1d09b54.480x360x1.jpg", "id": 42458, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c1830688225545aefb615c28999dfcb0.727x727x1.jpg", "index_character": "p", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Paul Anka", "slug": "Paul-anka", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Paul-anka"}, "artist": "Paul Anka", "lyrics": "Midnight LyricsMidnight\nIs for lovers\n\nSo let's Ispoon\nBeneath the moon\n\nThe silv'ry moon\nA up a high\n\nMidnight\nWe'll be together\nAt lover's lane\nWe'll kiss again\nAnd then again\nA at midnight\nYou hold my hand\nAnd you drive me in sane\n\nYou're burning up my heart\nAnd you tickle my brain\n\nYour eyes are blue\nYour lips are red\nThe old hootie owl way\nUp in a tree\n\nIs taking a peek at\nYou and me\n\nI don't care what it can seeSee Paul Anka LiveGet tickets as low as $60You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/299161", "artist_names": "Sheb Wooley", "full_title": "The Purple People Eater by\u00a0Sheb\u00a0Wooley", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5f043ecc7855fee88474f9a0f58e3ce1.300x302x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5f043ecc7855fee88474f9a0f58e3ce1.599x602x1.jpg", "id": 299161, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 351366, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1544934277, "path": "/Sheb-wooley-the-purple-people-eater-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Sheb-wooley-the-purple-people-eater-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1958, "month": 6, "day": 1}, "release_date_for_display": "June 1, 1958", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jun. 1, 1958", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5f043ecc7855fee88474f9a0f58e3ce1.300x302x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5f043ecc7855fee88474f9a0f58e3ce1.599x602x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 50252}, "title": "The Purple People Eater", "title_with_featured": "The Purple People Eater", "updated_by_human_at": 1639298471, "url": "https://genius.com/Sheb-wooley-the-purple-people-eater-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/109721", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/dcf6f30e1fb7bdc060037cb9aae9e408.480x360x1.jpg", "id": 109721, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/05bc4ed42bbcce67d234e2e01d8db89f.247x247x1.jpg", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Sheb Wooley", "slug": "Sheb-wooley", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Sheb-wooley"}, "artist": "Sheb Wooley", "lyrics": "The Purple People Eater LyricsAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!!!!\n\nWell, I saw the thing comin' out of the sky\nIt had a-one long horn and one big eye.
