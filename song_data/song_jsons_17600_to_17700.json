AFGHAN VILLAGE - DAY 7 INTERCUT AFGHAN VILLAGE. Intro Afghan warlord. AHMAD SHAH.\n35 years old. Tall, strong. Fierce. He moves through an Afghan village with a small pack of equally fierce Taliban warriors.\n3A.\n\ufffc\nLOCAL AFGHANS avoid eye contact. This Shah and crew feels like an old school western bad guy moving through a cow town.\nNOTHING like the SUICIDE BOMBERS of BAGDAD. These are real warriors. Strong-jawed. Thin but ripped muscles. Worn rich soulful faces, vivid eyes, color reds and blues. Strong boots. Military vests. Good radio equipment. Well-maintained weapons.\nShah\u2019s number two is TARAQ. Late twenties. Shah is vicious, TARAQ, is more vicious. Strong and very, very violent.\nA very worthy opponent.\nRIGHT now they are clearly pissed. Shah leads the way, walks with purpose.\nThey are looking for a man. Someone has violated TALIBAN LAW, accused of aiding the Americans.\nShah moves into a house. Women and children terrified. Trembling. Women pleading.\nWhere is he?\nSHAH SHAH Hagha Cherta Dey?\nThe women scream. As Shah starts throwing teenage boys around the room. Slamming them viciously into walls.\nA 25-year-old man Gulab tries to reason with Shah. A YOUNG BOY watches.\nGULAB GULAB\nPlease, we want no trouble. Mehrabani/lutfan, monga hes\nmushkil no ghowaro\nTaraq throws Gulab down hard. Turns, locks eyes with an older Afghan man(30s). Taraq moves quickly at him, kicking him in the face, his foot down hard on his throat.\nSHAH\nHave you spoken with the\nAmericans?\nAFGHAN MAN Please! No!\nSHAH\nAya taso Americayano sara khaberi keri dey?\nAFGHAN MAN\nMehrabani/lutfan! Na!\nGulab watches. Frustrated. Furious.\nYou lie! Please!\nTARAQ\nAFGHAN MAN\nTARAQ\nTa Dorogh wayee!\nAFGHAN MAN\nMehrabani/lutfan!\n4.\nHe\u2019s pressing down hard. Choking the man. The man\u2019s family begs and screams. Shah studies the Afghan deep into his eyes. Decides he\u2019s lying...Shah nods to Taraq.\nTaraq yanks the Afghan to his feet. As his children watch Taraq leads the pleading farmer outside. Into the woods.\nTaraq and his men throw the Afghan down over a fallen log. Face up.\nTwo of Taraq\u2019s men hold him by the beard as Taraq stands over him. Razor sharp machete up.\nShah backlit. Ignoring the man\u2019s pleading...as Taraq hacks down with brutal fury.\nTight on Shah, tight on Taraq, blood dripping from his hand.

Shave the boy.\nMURPHY Shane?\nSHANE PATTON\nWell, I could go both ways on this.\nHe did lose but, he was close and you\u2019re Mike Murphy and I would have expected a much bigger separation. Plus, we\u2019re at war and there\u2019s the whole Samson thing, so I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ll plead the fifth on this one.\nMurphy looks stares at Shane.\nSHANE PATTON (CONT\u2019D) But you\u2019re the boss, boss. So I\u2019m\nwith you.

PowerPoint.\n13.\nKRISTENSEN\nThis is the best picture we have of him. It\u2019s current.\n(MORE)\n13A.\nKRISTENSEN (CONT'D) We know Shah killed fourteen\nMarines last Tuesday in Kandahar. We just pulled this video off three different Tali web sights. It will in fact be a glorious day when Ahmad Shah and his good friend Taraq are no longer members of our human community.\nClear video of Shah executing a Taliban woman. Two men hold her down. Shah fires an AK-47. The bullet kicking up dust as it blasts through her skull into the dirt.\nThe SEALs study this footage. Dead serious.\nAXE\nGo back...freeze.\nAxe studies an image of Shah.\nAXE (CONT\u2019D) No earlobes.\nMURPHY What\u2019s that?\nAXE\nThe guys got no earlobes.\nSilence as the team studies the image.\nSHANE\nearlobes for anyway?\nDIETZ\nand balance.\nSHANE\nDIETZ\nI heard earlobes are key for head\nbalance - equilibrium. Cut a guys ear off, he\u2019s gonna suck on a drunk test, balance beam, tight rope...\nLUTTRELL\nFalse. Earlobes have no biological\nfunctions for humans.

Axe is going to go over our route in.\nAXE\nThe helo pilots are going to do two\nfalse inserts. Then drop us off at our primary insert, located here. Secondary insert located here. From our primary insert, our bearing will be zero three zero patrolling 1.5 kilometers to our designated lay up point. We will be moving up the backside of this mountain which will offer us good concealment from the target but the terrain is gonna be rocky so watch your footing. I\u2019m estimating it\u2019s gonna take us about two hours to complete.\nMURPHY Luttrell - medical\nLUTTRELL\nFirst things first, win the fight.\nThere\u2019s no medicine in a gunfight. It\u2019s self aid, buddy aid, corpsman aide. Two weeks ago, Team 3 was near where you guys will be. Capelli got bit by a rattlesnake. and contrary to popular belief, there is poison oak, so watch the cock and balls cause that will suck. Drink lots of water, wear sunscreen, and Dietz bring your own chapstick.\nDietz stands up, starts talking comms\nDIETZ\nCrypto will be wide band, segment 2-\n4. Murph\u2019s got a SAT phone.

Moves it over the map.\nDIETZ\nCorrect. Just for the infil. All\ncomms will be relayed through the AC-130, call sign Apollo. Suns up, she\u2019s out. Some of the key pro- words - when we have a successful insert, Budweiser. When we\u2019re halfway through infil, it\u2019ll be Corona. At our observation point, Schlitz Malt Liquor. And if we positively identify Shah: touchdown.\nDanny chucks the toy plane.\nMURPHY\nReaction Force is the following:\nThe 47\u2019s will relocate to J-Bad overnight.\nMurphy uses toy plastic helicopters to explain the size and location of the QRF.\nKRISTENSEN\nThat\u2019s correct. You\u2019ll have fifteen\nteam guys, and about a dozen Marines standing by all night. When we hear Schlitz Malt Liquor, we\u2019re heading back to Bagram for phase 2. QRF will stay here - we\u2019re leaving you with 4 team guys, 20 marines, 2 Blackhawks and 2 Apaches. The Apaches stay with the Blackhawks.\nThe toy Choppers circle on the map giving us a clear understanding of the playing field.\nKRISTENSEN (CONT\u2019D) The movement is so we can get the\n47\u2019s back here and be ready to bring it for phase two once you get eyes on Shah. Remember - comms will most likely be intermittent and there are reports that non- combatants are being used as recon elements for the enemy.\nMURPHY Roger that.\nLuttrell spits chew. Danny doodles furious, mashing demons. Axe quietly studies the picture of Ahmad Shah.\n16.\nJAG GOES OVER RULES OF ENGAGEMENT\nAXE Lotta moving parts.\nMURPHY\nWhat we do, when we do, what we do.\nKRISTENSEN\nWe go in four hours.

That\u2019s our business.\nMURPHY What\u2019s two?\nDANNY\nTwo is, this is the Navy and you\u2019re\nthe boss and your job is to be the boss and my job is to do what I\u2019m fucking told.\nOk.\nMURPHY\nDANNY\nSo you tell me what to do and it\nwill be done. Murphy looks to Marcus.\nMURPHY\nMarcus what\u2019s your call?\nLuttrell seems to get that with Danny out, Murphy\u2019s for letting them go, Axe wants them dead - he\u2019s the tie-breaker.\n50.\nON MURPHY.\nLUTTRELL\n(slowly shaking his head)\nNo. I\u2019d rather fight them straight up. I don\u2019t want to kill these kids.\nThinking. He looks around the area. Looking for a burial spot. Stabbing at the stone earth with his M4. Clearly no soft earth anywhere close.\nMURPHY (quiet)\nFuck me.\nMurphy stares down at the Afghan village. Then long and hard at the three Afghans. Finally turns back to goat herders.\nDANNY\nLook at them. They fucking hate us.\nWe don\u2019t know how many Hajji\u2019s they have down there. We can\u2019t let them go.\nLUTTRELL\nSo now you have an opinion? I\nthought you were standing by waiting for your orders?\nAXE\nThis opp is a soup sandwich. Been so from the beginning. The pitch. The rope. Worst comms that I\u2019ve ever seen. Soft intel, we are not wearing vests, have no heavy weapons, are weak in numbers.... It\u2019s a cursed opp.\nMURPHY\nStarting to feel like a cursed opp.\nLUTTRELL\nIt\u2019s not a cursed opp. There are no fucking curses. Just Afghanistan. That\u2019s all. Everyday man. Devil\u2019s asshole.\nAXE\nShah just killed twenty marines\nlast week and we\u2019re on him. We\u2019ve come this far and these people here are him. They are a part of him. We let them go.\n(MORE)\n51.\nAXE (CONT'D)\nWe\u2019re letting him go and why in the\nfucking world does he have the right to do that to us?\nAxe is starring at LUTTRELL.\n51A.\nSilence.\nAXE.\nSeriously Marcus. Why does he have\nthe right to do that to us?\nLUTTRELL\nI don\u2019t see it that way.\nMURPHY\nSo what is your fucking call bro?\nLUTTRELL\nLet them go. Shut it down.\nSo if Murphy was taking a vote it seems like it\u2019s one vote for killing them, one vote for letting them go, Danny is neutral.\nThis is all on MURPHY.\nMurphy turns away from them, looking down the steep pitched mountain. The village far below.\nMurphy thinks. Looks at the young kids. The old man.\nMURPHY\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do. Pack\nup. Everything. We\u2019re gonna let \u2018em go and we\u2019re gonna make the peak. When we make the peak were gonna make Comms. We\u2019re calling QRF and we\u2019re getting out.\nSilence as the guys take in the plan. Luttrell lets out a huge breath.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\nDANNY Roger that.\nLUTTRELL Yes sir.\nMURPHY Let\u2019s move it.\nQuick Shots.\nThe guys quickly breaking down their gear. The goat boy watching confused.\n52.\nThe older Goat herders. Defiant. Steel-eyed.\n52A.\n41 INT. SEAL TOC. BAGRAM. 41\nKristensen, Patton with Petty Officer Dan Healy, James Suh and some COMMS guys.\nThe Comms guys trying to get Spartan 01 back on line.\nCOMMS GUY\nSpartan 01, Spartan 01, over.\nKristensen is on the phone, communicating with J-Bad TOC\nKRISTENSEN\nWhen was your last contact with\nSpartan 01?\n42 EXT. J-BAD TOC. 42 The two Blackhawks standing by with the two Apaches.\nThe Apache pilots are firing up their engines.\nMusslemen comes out of a pilot station.\nMUSSLEMEN\nWhere are you guys going?\nAPACHE PILOT\nWe just got called North. By an\nArmy 372, evidently they took some small fire.\nMUSSLEMEN\nWe\u2019re QRF, bro.\nAPACHE PILOT\nThat\u2019s what we thought. BAGRAM is\nnow QRF.\nThe 47s?\nCorrect.\nAre we not the QRF now?\nAPACHE PILOT That\u2019s my understanding.\nMussleman is a bit confused...\nMUSSLEMEN\nAPACHE PILOT\nMUSSLEMEN\n53.\nApache pilots climb into their two birds. Take off.\n43 EXT. MOUNTAIN 43\n10 MINUTES LATER:\nGear packed the four SEALs stand over the Afghans.\nMURPHY CONT\u2019D Everybody good?\nQuick nods from the team as Murphy\u2019s flip knife comes out. He quickly cuts through the flex cuffs. Freeing the Afghans.\nMURPHY\nYou three just won the lottery.\nSpeak well of us.\nAn odd moment as the Afghans stare at the SEALs. Not fully understanding that they are free to leave.\nGo!\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D)\nThe little goat boy stares at Murphy. A beat then gets it. Turning fast he takes off sprinting down the hill.\nThe old man holds a beat. Says something quietly to the team. Sounds fairly ominous.\nThen he too turns and slowly, deliberately starts making his way down the long steep mountain.\nMurphy looks at the team.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) Let\u2019s move it.\nThe four SEALs, full gear, start moving up the mountain.\nThere is no trail. Just steep rocks, fallen trees, and a brutal pitch.\n43A THE YOUNG GOAT BOY. 43A RUNNING DOWN THE HILL.\n54.\nLeaping over rocks. Fallen trees. The kid\u2019s movements are beautiful. Mountain agility in his DNA. Virtually FLYING down the mountain.\n43B UP TOP. 43B\nSlow going for the SEALs. Murphy leading. Danny, loaded up with COMMS, second. Luttrell breathing hard. Axe bringing up the rear.\nOn AXE\nConstantly checking behind him.\nHis left foot catches on some loose granite. Gives out.\nAxe rolls his ankle hard. Slips, falls hard sliding fast tumbling and smashing hard into a fallen tree stump.\nSprained right ankle and bruised left ribs.\nMurphy stops, looking back as Luttrell moves down to Axe. Axe struggling back on his feet.\nYou ok?\nLUTTRELL.\nAXE Fucking Afghanistan.\nLUTTRELL.\nYea. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s supposed to\nbe falling.\nAXE I\u2019m fine.\nHe takes a step. White flash of burst pain tears through him. He buckles. Clearly not alright.\n43C THE GOAT KID 43C Running hard approaching the village.\n43D UP TOP. 43D Luttrell reaches for him. Axe pulls away.\nAXE (CONT'D) I\u2019m good. Let\u2019s go.\nAxe digs his foot in. Grinds through the pain and starts back up the hill.\n55.\nAXE (CONT'D)\nMaybe we should just hike down to\nthe village, ask to borrow a phone.\nTight on Murphy\u2019s small smile as he digs it up the hill. The group now moving even slower cause of Axe\u2019s ankle.\n44 EXT. THE VILLAGE. 44\nQuiet. A couple of small fires. Some cooking. A group of young boys playing with sticks. Women cooking as - The young GOAT BOY comes tearing, full sprint into the village.\nTIGHT ON THE GOAT BOY. Eyes wide. Screaming for Shah.\nVillagers start to gather. Shah approaches the boys. Breathing hard, they point up the mountain.\nA couple of Taliban hear this. Take off into the woods.\nTRACKING with the two Taliban.\nAs they sprint deeper into the woods. Into the Taliban camp.\nTaliban soldiers sleeping. The two find Shah and Taraq. Tell them about the Americans.\nShah quickly on his walkie talkie, old school but deathly effective. Rounding up his fighters.\nQuick shots of the Taliban army. Feels like 150 men. Arming themselves. AK\u2019s, RPG\u2019s, grenades, a lot of ammo. Radio gear.\nQuiet, cool, professional. These Afghan soldiers are loading up big time...\n45 EXT. UP MOUNTAIN. 45 The SEALs cresting the hill.\nFuck.\nMURPHY\nHe\u2019s looking up at a larger hill in front of them. They have just ascended a false summit. Still blocked in by another very steep mountain.\nDanny?\nMURPHY (CONT'D)\n56.\nDietz is already into the radio, as Luttrell and Axe spread out, digging in, guns pointed down hill.\nNothing.\nDANNY (on radio)\nAnvil 1 this is Spartan 01, over.\nMURPHY Great.\nComms still clearly dead. Murphy weighing his options. They are high above the village. Murphy pulls out binoculars. Scanning the village and mountain.\nAll three SEALs on glass. SCANNING. SEALS POV\nNothing moving. From their vantage the town seems quiet. Business as usual.\nThey cannot see the Taliban off in the woods. They are OBLIVIOUS to the magnitude of the threat.\nCUT TO:\n46 TWENTY MINUTES LATER. 46\nDanny still working the radio. Axe has tightened his boot. Murphy and Luttrell have spread out on the hill. Staring down at the village.\nMurphy\u2019s got his SAT phone out. Trying to get a signal. Can\u2019t.\nHe\u2019s looking with disgust at the mountain behind him, knowing that it\u2019s blocking his signal.\nMURPHY (to mountain)\nMove Bitch.\nLuttrell\u2019s fifteen feet to his left.\nLUTTRELL What do you want to do?\nMURPHY\nGo home, get in bed, and watch\nAnchorman.\n57.\nCheck.\nLUTTRELL\nMURPHY I wanna be on you.\nLUTTRELL\nRoger that. Should I spread the\nword?\nMURPHY\nNot just yet. Let\u2019s hold up for an\nhour and see just how big of a can of hell we\u2019ve opened.\nLUTTRELL What do you think?\nMURPHY\nWe did the right thing. We let our\nlove light shine. God ought to be smiling down on us. Isn\u2019t that how it works? Good things happen to good people?\nLUTTRELL\nYou think they\u2019re coming after us?\nMURPHY\nLike a pack of wild dogs.\nMURPHY keys his radio.\nMURPHY (CONT\u2019D) What say you Axe?\nAXE (on radio)\nI\u2019m fine.\nMurphy looks up behind him to the large cliff.\nMURPHY (to Axe)\nYou good to go?\nAXE\nNo problems boss.\nMURPHY\nHere\u2019s the deal. Lay low here.\nSoon as the sun sets we move.\n(MORE)\n58.\nMURPHY (CONT'D)\nIf we can\u2019t get comms from that top we\u2019re probably gonna have to walk home anyway, so get some rest. Axe you\u2019re first security. We move in about sixty minutes.\n46A THIRTY MINUTES LATER. 46A Murphy, Danny, and Marcus. Hats low. Eyes closed. Danny on\nthe glass.\nIt\u2019s quiet. Sun getting low. Probably two hours of sunlight left.\nON AXE.\nCalmly checking down hill, whistling very quietly to himself.\nTight on Luttrell resting.\nDanny. Eyes closed. One arm around his radio.\nMurphy. Eyes open. Staring up at the sky.\nBack to Axe. Focused down range.\nDown the mountain. Something appears to move. Axe misses it. Hold a beat. More movement.\nJust catches Axe\u2019s peripheral... Axe shifts his gaze. Focusing.\nTHEN\nMore movement. Axe sees it, raises his gun eye to the scope. Gently scanning the area of movement.\nStops whistling.\nAXE\u2019S POV:\nNo movement.\nAxe slowly pans his M-4 across the hill. Suddenly A FLASH OF SOMETHING HUMAN.\nA HUMAN. He pans a bit more to the right. Then two more.\nAXE pans way to the right. Almost as high as the SEALs are and he see\u2019s more movement.\nThey are almost surrounded.\nTIGHT ON LUTTRELL eyes still closed.\n59.\nMURPHY (CONT'D) (oc)\nSssst! Sssst!\nLuttrell lifts up his hat and looks left.\nSees Axe, rigid, in firing position, his rifle aimed straight up the mountain.\nMURPHY (CONT'D) (to Danny)\nTry and call it in.\nDanny desperate to get the radio to work.\nLuttrell fixes his Mark 12 into firing position looks through scope down hill.\nLUTTRELL\u2019S POV.\nLined along the top are at least a dozen heavily armed Taliban warriors, each one of them with an AK pointing downward. Some carrying rocket propelled grenades.\nLUTTRELL looks left.\nMore Taliban coming down hill to flank them. Luttrell looks right.\nMore Taliban.\nThe SEALs are FUCKED.\nMURPHY (CONT'D)\nHow the fuck fast are these little\nbastards? All four SEALs guns up.\nMarcus in the middle, Axe and Danny up to his left. Murphy twenty feet off to his right. Marcus slowly belly crawls towards Murphy.\nMURPHY (CONT'D) What are you thinking?\nLUTTRELL\nI\u2019m thinking that we\u2019re about\nfixing to get into a pretty good gunfight.\nYea.\nMURPHY\n60.\nLUTTRELL\nLooks like I voted wrong.\nMURPHY\nNegative. We\u2019ve been given the\nopportunity to reach out and make some hell fucking strong contact with our friends from the other side. Job well done.\nLUTTRELL Hoo-yah to that sir.\nON DANNY AND AXE\nLooking up the hill which is now swarming with Taliban. Dozens of soldiers flowing down hill flanking them.\nDANNY Do they see us?\nAXE Dunno.\nBACK TO MARCUS.\nHis back pressed up against a tree, inventorying his ammo. Grenades. Knife.\nDanny, Axe, Murphy all doing the same. Readying for war.\nAxe and Danny sneak quick looks at the pictures of their wives taped inside their helmets.\nThe trap tightening around all of them. All four focused up hill.\nA TREE TWENTY FEET IN FRONT OF MARCUS.\nA flash of a turban. Glint of an AK Barrel pointed in his general direction.\nLuttrell tightens the grip of his rifle slowly starts pointing it in the direction of the man behind the tree.\nLuttrell eyes on glass, still as marble. Aimed at the tree.\nMarcus looks over his shoulder at Murphy whose gun is also trained on the tree.\nMarcus eyes back on the scope. SCOPE POV:\n61.\nA fierce-eyed Taliban warrior peering straight into the scope. Black eyes and thick black beard. The barrel of his AK pointed dead on Luttrell.\nHold.\nTHEN.\nLuttrell fires once. Blowing the man\u2019s head off.\nAn odd brief moment of silence as the head shot Afghan stumbles, still standing, still clutching his AK-47. He takes three more steps towards Luttrell.\nStops.\nLuttrell shoots again removes what\u2019s left of the fighter\u2019s head.\nThe Afghan starts to fall and as he hits the ground, all HELL BREAKS LOOSE.\nFrom above and half way down both flanks the Taliban open fire.\nScreaming at each other, communicating through violent, loud bursts of Pashto, the Taliban moving fast down the hill. Agile and fearless, not weighted down with US-style gear, they are able to leap boulders, fallen trees.\nTaraq in the middle of the pack on the top of the SEALs. UP TOP - Shah calmly giving orders into his radio comms.\nON MURPHY.\nTaliban moving down the hill on both sides. Shooting as they move.\nA solid line of at least fifty Taliban in firing positions on top of the hill above them.\nThe SEALs are close to being surrounded.\nMURPHY checks his rear.\nMURPHY POV\nA cliff. More of a series of cliffs. Multiple death falls. First one is at least 300 feet.\nMurphy calls it.\nPush right flank.\nMURPHY\n62.\nAxe the farthest right starts shooting and moving right INTO the wall of the Taliban flanking his right.\nLuttrell follows staying low, shooting, Danny firing with one arm. Desperate to get the radio up.\nDANNY\nSpartan 01 reporting major enemy\ncontact. We need help. Spartan 01 reporting major enemy contact. Request immediate QRF! Spartan 01 requesting immediate QRF.\nMurphy\u2019s doing the same with his SAT phone. He\u2019s moving right trying to dial up the TOC. Not getting through.\nDanny\u2019s left two fingers HIT. Dangling bloody and mangled.\nHe tries to put them back into his hand. Jams his ring finger back into its socket. His pinkie is beyond repair.\nDANNY (CONT\u2019D)\nMarcus!\nLuttrell turns, Danny holds up his fucked up hand.\nLUTTRELL Wrap it up bro.\nDANNY Roger that.\nTaliban gunfire is picking up. Axe the deepest right kills two Taliban. Two more immediately fill their positions.\nMURPHY\nDanny did you get the call through?\nDANNY\nI made the call. Don\u2019t know if it\nwent through. You?\nMURPHY\nI couldn\u2019t get a line.\nDANNY Fuck.\nMarcus is pushing right behind Axe trying to break the right Taliban flank.\nCharging the Ambush.\n63.\nMURPHY\nKeep pushing right. Kill \u2018em all.\nThe four SEALs fighting well as a team. Crawling, shooting and covering as they start making progress killing their way into the right side of the Taliban ambush.\nThe Taliban close enough to see clearly.\nAxe shot through the left shoulder. Ignoring it he keeps firing. His long scope making him very accurate. As he shoots deep into the left flank.\nTALIBAN POV:\nFrom behind at least 12 Tabliban fighters pushing deeper into the right side.\nTwo more Taliban hit. The remaining start taking solid covering positions, firing down at the four SEALs.\nAxe being the closest takes the majority of the firepower.\nDecent cover from a granite boulder which is getting hacked to pieces by the incoming AK fire.\nRazor sharp stone shrapnel chunks slicing into Axe\u2019s face and neck. Blood runs down his face drips off his chin.\nLuttrell getting equally shot up. Returning fire. His cover rock getting shot up bad. Chunks of granite tearing into his face and neck.\nFURTHER to the left, Danny and Murphy shooting, trying to get closer to Luttrell and Axe.\nDanny takes another round, blowing clear through his right thigh shattering his right femur. Blood, muscle chunks and bone tear through his pants.\nDANNY Goddammitt.\nPissed he keeps moving. Firing. Ignoring his two gunshots. Hand and Leg.\nDanny moves up with Murphy behind some decent cover.\nMURPHY Can you fight?\nDANNY Roger that.\n64.\nMURPHY\nWant me to take the radio?\nDANNY Negative.\nMurphy looks up towards Axe who is far right.\nMURPHY (yelling)\nAXE?!\nAXE Sir!\nMURPHY\nCan we break that flank? Hold\nthis, we\u2019re gonna push left!\nAxe gets shot through the top of his shoulder the bullet tearing down through his shoulder and burning deep inside his chest.\nAxe keeps firing, hitting a Taliban in the knee. The Taliban fires back at Axe missing but sending sharp rock chips shearing up off the granite into Axe\u2019s face. Shredding his right ear, cutting into his eyeballs.\nHalf blind. Watery out of focus images as sweat mixed with blood. Axe struggles to see. When his vision clears up enough to focus:\nAXE POV.\nTwo Tali fighters. Moving fast out of cover, right at AXE. Directly at the Americans. SEAL style. Attacking the counter attack.\nThe Taliban are close to the half blind Axe. Axe fires blind. Misses. The Taliban almost on him. Then:\nOne of the Tali hit with a round from Luttrell, killed. The other, wounded, falls on Axe. Vicious hand-to-hand fight.\nLuttrell runs up to help Axe. Takes the remaining Taliban soldier out with a point-blank headshot.\nFrom the right, a BELT FED MACHINE GUN opens up on their position.\nMarcus and Axe start moving left.

ON THE MOUNTAIN 48 CHAOS.\nA massive barrage of gunfire erupting from the right Taliban flank.\nAXE Right is no good.\nMurphy looks left. He can see twenty Taliban moving into firing positions.\nMURPHY Fuck me.\nThe first RPG comes from the left side. Hitting just short of Danny and Murphy. Blasting them backwards.

Fall off. Danny can you\nmove?\nDANNY No problem.\nAxe?\nMURPHY\nAXE Good to go.\nAs the four shot up SEALs turn and start to move fast towards the edge of the cliff. The pitch causing them to run and start falling immediately. Danny\u2019s legs giving out, buckling as he hurls himself up and over the ledge.\nMarcus turns to Murphy.\nLuttrell, Murphy and Axe do the same. For a second they look like four country boys cliff jumping into a lake. Except for the blood streaming from necks and guts and legs, the bullet tracers flying all around them...\nThey fly off the cliff and it looks kind of beautiful. Freeing...until.\n48A IMPACT. BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF 48A\nBone crushing. Concussive. Violent beyond words. Human bodies smashing into rock. Tearing through trees. Bouncing. Broken bones and smashed faces. Helmets fly off.

Looking up.\nMURPHY\nWe just got to get off this hill.\n48E HALFWAY DOWN 1ST CLIFF. 48E\nShah\u2019s Taliban are slowly moving down the cliff. Not nearly as fast as the SEALs fall.

Ravine. 48J\nTight shots of the four SEALs scrambling for their lives. Bleeding, spit, sweat, snot, tears as they claw their way across the burning mountain.\nThis is a sequence. Watching the men run. Legs buckling. Knee caps smashing on rock. Slipping falling helping each other. Incoming rounds tearing past them.

There\u2019s\nno question a part of me will forever be up on that mountain dead as my brothers died.\nClose on heart monitor.\nLUTTRELL (CONT\u2019D)\nBut, there is a part of me that lived. Because of my brothers, because of them, I am still alive, and I can never forget that no matter how much it hurts, how dark it gets, how far you fall...\nFrom flatline to a heartbeat.\nLUTTRELL(CONT\u2019D)\nYou are never out of the fight.\nLONE SURVIVOR.\n124.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1092137", "artist_names": "The Dave Clark

HOUSE \u2013 NIGHT\n\n[Lawrence, Kansas\n22 years ago]\n\nCrickets chirp. A large deciduous tree with no leaves\u2005stands\u2005outside one of\u2005several suburban homes.\nINT. NURSERY \u2013 NIGHT\nA\u2005WOMAN, MARY WINCHESTER, wearing a white nightgown, carries a SMALL CHILD, her son DEAN, into a dark room.\nMARY: Come on, let's say good night to your brother.\n\nMARY turns on the lights: it's the nursery of a BABY, SAM, who is lying in his crib and looking over at MARY and DEAN. MARY sets DEAN down. DEAN leans over the side of the crib and kisses SAM on the forehead.\n\nDEAN: 'Night, Sam.\n\nMARY leans over SAM as well.\n\nMARY: Good night, love.\n\nMARY brushes SAM's hair back and kisses his forehead.\n\nMAN: Hey, Dean.\n\nDEAN turns. The MAN in the doorway wearing a USMC T-shirt is JOHN. DEAN rushes over to him.\n\nDEAN: Daddy!\n\nJOHN: Hey, buddy. (scoops DEAN up) So what do you think? You think Sammy's ready to toss around a football yet?\n\nDEAN shakes his head, laughing.\n\nDEAN: No, Daddy.\n\nJOHN laughs.\nJOHN: No.\n\nMARY passes JOHN and DEAN on the way out of the room.\n\nMARY: You got him?\n\nJOHN: I got him. (hugs DEAN closer) Sweet dreams, Sam.\n\nJOHN carries DEAN out of the room, flipping off the lights. SAM watches them go, gurgling, then tries to reach his toes. The baseball-themed mobile above SAM's crib begins to spin on its own while SAM watches. The transportation-themed clock on the wall ticks, ticks, stops. The moon-shaped nightlight flickers.\nINT. MASTER BEDROOM \u2013 NIGHT\nLights flicker on a baby monitor sitting on a nightstand next to a photo of MARY and JOHN. Strange noises come through the monitor. MARY, asleep in bed, stirs. She turns on the light on the nightstand.\n\nMARY: John?\n\nMARY turns: she's alone. She gets up.\nINT. HALLWAY \u2013 NIGHT\nMARY walks down the hall to SAM's nursery. JOHN, seen only in silhouette, stands over SAM's crib.\n\nMARY: John? Is he hungry?\n\nJOHN turns his head.\nMAN: Shhh.\n\nMARY: All right.\n\nMARY heads back down the hallway. The light by the stairs is flickering. MARY frowns and goes to tap at it till the light steadies.\n\nMARY: Hm.\n\nMore flickering light is coming from downstairs: MARY investigates. A war movie is on TV and JOHN has fallen asleep watching it. If JOHN is here, MARY realizes, then the MAN upstairs cannot be JOHN and must be a danger. She runs back upstairs.\n\nMARY: Sammy! Sammy!\n\nMARY enters SAM's nursery and stops short.\nINT. LIVING ROOM \u2013 NIGHT\nUpstairs, MARY screams. JOHN wakes up.\n\nJOHN: Mary? (scrambles out of the chair) Mary!\n\nJOHN runs upstairs.\nINT. NURSERY \u2013 NIGHT\nJOHN bursts through the closed door of the nursery.\n\nJOHN: Mary.\n\nThe room is quiet and appears empty except for SAM awake in his crib and JOHN. JOHN glances around and pushes down the side of SAM's crib.\n\nJOHN: Hey, Sammy. You okay?\n\nSomething dark drips next to SAM. JOHN touches it. Two more drops land on the back of JOHN's hand. It looks like blood. JOHN looks up. MARY is sprawled across the ceiling, the stomach of her nightgown red with blood, staring at JOHN and struggling to breathe. JOHN collapses onto the floor, staring at MARY.\n\nJOHN: No! Mary!\n\nMARY bursts into flame. The fire spreads over the ceiling. JOHN stares, frozen. SAM wails. JOHN, reminded he's not alone, gets up and scoops SAM out of his crib and rushes out of the room.\nINT. HALLWAY \u2013 NIGHT\nDEAN is awake and coming to investigate.\n\nDEAN: Daddy!\n\nJOHN shoves SAM at DEAN.\n\nJOHN: Take your brother outside as fast as you can and don't look back! Now, Dean, go!\n\nDEAN turns and runs. JOHN turns back to the nursery.\n\nJOHN: Mary!\n\nThe entire room is on fire. MARY herself can barely be seen.\n\nJOHN: No!\n\nEXT. HOUSE \u2013 NIGHT\nDEAN runs outside, holding SAM.\n\nDEAN: It's okay, Sammy.\n\nDEAN turns to look up at SAM's window, which is lit with gold. JOHN runs outside, scoops up DEAN and SAM, and carries them both away.\n\nJOHN: I gotcha.\n\nFire explodes out of SAM's nursery window.\nEXT. HOUSE \u2013 NIGHT, LATER\nThe Lawrence fire department has arrived. A FIREFIGHTER gets out of a fire truck and takes over at the gauges for another firefighter.\n\nFIREFIGHTER: I got it. You go hold the line up.\n\nThe second firefighter goes to the back of the truck and takes a hose from a third firefighter. That firefighter takes the hose towards the house where a fourth firefighter is spraying through SAM's nursery window. A paramedic opens the back of an ambulance. A POLICE OFFICER waves some neighbors back.\n\nOFFICER: Stay back. You have to stay back.\n\nAcross the street from the house, JOHN and DEAN sit on the hood of JOHN's Impala, JOHN holding SAM. JOHN looks up at the remnants of the fire.ACT ONE[Stanford University\nPresent Day]\n\n\"Gasoline\" by Ginger begins to play.\nINT. BEDROOM \u2013 DAY\n\nYOUNG WOMAN: Sam!\n\nThe YOUNG WOMAN, JESS, comes around a corner; she is wearing a sexy-nurse costume and adjusting her hat. The photo of MARY and JOHN from earlier is on the dresser.\n\nJESS: Get a move on, would you? We were supposed to be there like fifteen minutes ago.\n\nJESS walks off.\n\nJESS: Sam! You coming or what?\n\nA YOUNG MAN pokes his head around the corner; this is SAM. He's wearing jeans and three shirts, not a costume.\n\nSAM: Do I have to?\n\nJESS: Yes! It'll be fun.\n\nSAM comes into the room.\n\nJESS: And where's your costume?\n\nSAM laughs and ducks his head.\n\nSAM: You know how I feel about Halloween.\n\nCUT TO: INT. BAR \u2013 NIGHT\nClassic's \"What Cha Gonna Do\" begins to play. The bar is decorated for Halloween (including a gargoyle with cobwebs and a baseball hat that says \"GET NAKED\"). Someone pours someone else a shot. Everyone is in costume. JESS raises a glass as a YOUNG MAN in a ghoul costume, LUIS, comes up to the table where SAM and JESS are. SAM is still not in costume.\n\nJESS: So here's to Sam, and his awesome LSAT victory.\n\nSAM: All right, all right, it's not that big a deal.\n\nJESS, SAM, and LUIS clink glasses.\n\nJESS: Yeah, he acts all humble. But he scored a one seventy-four.\n\nLUIS drinks his shot and so does SAM.\n\nLUIS: Is that good?\n\nJESS: Scary good.\n\nJESS drinks.\n\nLUIS: So there you go. You are a first-round draft pick. You can go to any law school you want!\n\nLUIS sits next to SAM.\n\nSAM: Actually, I got an interview here. Monday. If it goes okay I think I got a shot at a full ride next year.\n\nJESS: Hey. It's gonna go great.\n\nSAM: It better.\n\nLUIS: How does it feel to be the golden boy of your family?\n\nSAM: Ah, they don't know.\n\nLUIS: Oh, no, I would be gloating! Why not?\n\nSAM: Because we're not exactly the Bradys.\n\nLUIS: And I'm not exactly the Huxtables. More shots?\n\nJESS and SAM speak in chorus.\n\nJESS and SAM: No. No.\n\nSAM: No.\n\nLUIS goes up to the bar anyway.\n\nJESS: No, seriously. I'm proud of you. And you're gonna knock 'em dead on Monday and you're gonna get that full ride. I know it.\n\nSAM: What would I do without you?\n\nJESS: Crash and burn.\n\nJESS smiles and pulls SAM in for a kiss.\n\nCUT TO: INT. BEDROOM \u2013 NIGHT\nSAM and JESS lie in bed, asleep back to back. JESS shifts position. A sound outside the room, like a window opening. SAM opens his eyes.\nINT. APARTMENT \u2013 NIGHT\nSAM leaves the bedroom and looks around the apartment. A window is open; earlier it must have been closed. Footsteps. A MAN walks past the strings of beads at the far end of the hall. SAM moves to another part of the apartment and waits. The MAN enters the room. SAM lunges forward and grabs the MAN at the shoulder. The MAN knocks SAM's arm away and aims a strike at SAM, who ducks. The MAN grabs SAM's arm, swings him around, and shoves him back. SAM kicks and is blocked, then pushed back into another room. If the MAN hadn't seen SAM's face before, he sees it now; SAM gets his first glimpse of the MAN. The MAN elbows SAM in the face; SAM kicks at his head. The MAN ducks and swings and SAM blocks. The MAN knocks SAM down and pins him to the floor, one hand at SAM's neck and the other holding SAM's wrist.\n\nMAN: Whoa, easy, tiger.\n\nSAM breathes hard.\n\nSAM: Dean?\n\nDEAN laughs.\n\nSAM: You scared the crap out of me!\n\nDEAN: That's 'cause you're out of practice.\n\nSAM grabs DEAN's hand and yanks, slamming his heel into DEAN's back and DEAN to the floor.\n\nDEAN: Or not.\n\nSAM taps DEAN twice where SAM is holding him.\n\nDEAN: Get off of me.\n\nSAM rolls to his feet and pulls DEAN up.\n\nSAM: What the hell are you doing here?\n\nDEAN: Well, I was looking for a beer.\n\nDEAN puts his hands on SAM's shoulders, shakes once, and lets go.\n\nSAM: What the hell are you doing here?\n\nDEAN: Okay. All right. We gotta talk.\n\nSAM: Uh, the phone?\n\nDEAN: If I'd'a called, would you have picked up?\n\nJESS turns the light on. She is wearing very short shorts and a cropped Smurfs shirt.\n\nJESS: Sam?\n\nSAM and DEAN turn their heads in unison.\n\nSAM: Jess. Hey. Dean, this is my girlfriend, Jessica.\n\nDEAN looks at her appreciatively.\n\nJESS: Wait, your brother Dean?\n\nJESS smiles. SAM nods. DEAN grins at her and moves closer.\n\nDEAN: Oh, I love the Smurfs. You know, I gotta tell you. You are completely out of my brother's league.\n\nJESS: Just let me put something on.\n\nJESS turns to go. DEAN's voice stops her.\n\nDEAN: No, no, no, I wouldn't dream of it. Seriously.\n\nDEAN goes back over to SAM without taking his eyes off JESS. SAM watches him, his expression stony.\n\nDEAN: Anyway, I gotta borrow your boyfriend here, talk about some private family business. But, uh, nice meeting you.\n\nSAM: No. (goes over to JESS and puts an arm around her) No, whatever you want to say, you can say it in front of her.\n\nDEAN: Okay. (turns to look at them both straight on) Um. Dad hasn't been home in a few days.\n\nSAM: So he's working overtime on a Miller Time shift. He'll stumble back in sooner or later.\n\nDEAN ducks his head and looks back up.\n\nDEAN: Dad's on a hunting trip. And he hasn't been home in a few days.\n\nSAM's expression doesn't change while he takes this in. JESS glances up at him.\n\nSAM: Jess, excuse us. We have to go outside.\n\nINT. STAIRWELL \u2013 NIGHT\nSAM and DEAN head downstairs. SAM has put on jeans and a hoodie.\n\nSAM: I mean, come on. You can't just break in, middle of the night, and expect me to hit the road with you.\n\nDEAN: You're not hearing me, Sammy. Dad's missing. I need you to help me find him.\n\nSAM: You remember the poltergeist in Amherst? Or the Devil's Gates in Clifton? He was missing then, too. He's always missing, and he's always fine.\n\nDEAN stops and turns around. SAM stops too.\n\nDEAN: Not for this long. Now are you gonna come with me or not?\n\nSAM: I'm not.\n\nDEAN: Why not?\n\nSAM: I swore I was done hunting. For good.\n\nDEAN: Come on. It wasn't easy, but it wasn't that bad.\n\nDEAN starts downstairs again. SAM follows.\n\nSAM: Yeah? When I told Dad I was scared of the thing in my closet, he gave me a .45.\n\nDEAN stops at the door to the outside.\n\nDEAN: Well, what was he supposed to do?\n\nSAM: I was nine years old! He was supposed to say, don't be afraid of the dark.\n\nDEAN: Don't be afraid of the dark? Are you kidding me? Of course you should be afraid of the dark. You know what's out there.\n\nSAM: Yeah, I know, but still. The way we grew up, after Mom was killed, and Dad's obsession to find the thing that killed her.\n\nDEAN glances outside.\n\nSAM: But we still haven't found the damn thing. So we kill everything we can find.\n\nDEAN: We save a lot of people doing it, too.\n\nA pause.\n\nSAM: You think Mom would have wanted this for us?\n\nDEAN rolls his eyes and slams the door open.\nEXT. PARKING LOT \u2013 NIGHT\nThere's a short flight of stairs from the door to the parking lot. DEAN and SAM climb it.\n\nSAM: The weapon training, and melting the silver into bullets? Man, Dean, we were raised like warriors.\n\nThey cross the parking lot to the Impala from the prologue.\n\nDEAN: So what are you gonna do? You're just gonna live some normal, apple pie life? Is that it?\n\nSAM: No. Not normal. Safe.\n\nDEAN: And that's why you ran away.\n\nDEAN looks away.\n\nSAM: I was just going to college. It was Dad who said if I was gonna go I should stay gone. And that's what I'm doing.\n\nDEAN: Yeah, well, Dad's in real trouble right now. If he's not dead already. I can feel it.\n\nSAM is silent.\n\nDEAN: I can't do this alone.\n\nSAM: Yes you can.\n\nDEAN looks down.\n\nDEAN: Yeah, well, I don't want to.\n\nSAM sighs and looks down, thinking, then up.\n\nSAM: What was he hunting?\n\nDEAN opens the trunk of the Impala, then the spare-tire compartment. It's an arsenal. He props the compartment open with a shotgun and digs through the clutter.\n\nDEAN: All right, let's see, where the hell did I put that thing?\n\nSAM: So when Dad left, why didn't you go with him?\n\nDEAN: I was working my own gig. This, uh, voodoo thing, down in New Orleans.\n\nSAM: Dad let you go on a hunting trip by yourself?\n\nDEAN looks over at SAM.\n\nDEAN: I'm twenty-six, dude. (pulls some papers out of a folder) All right, here we go. So Dad was checking out this two-lane blacktop just outside of Jericho, California. About a month ago, this guy. (hands one of the papers to SAM) They found his car, but he vanished. Completely MIA.\n\nThe paper is a printout of an article from the Jericho Herald, headlined \"Centennial Highway Disappearance\" and dated Sept. 19th 2005; it has a man's picture, captioned \"Andrew Carey MISSING\". SAM reads it and glances up.\n\nSAM: So maybe he was kidnapped.\n\nDEAN: Yeah. Well, here's another one in April. (tosses down another Jericho Herald article for each date he mentions) Another one in December 'oh-four, 'oh-three, 'ninety-eight, 'ninety-two, ten of them over the past twenty years. (takes the article back from SAM and picks up the rest of the stack, putting them back in the folder) All men, all the same five-mile stretch of road. (pulls a bag out of another part of the arsenal) It started happening more and more, so Dad went to go dig around. That was about three weeks ago. I hadn't heard from him since, which is bad enough. (grabs a handheld tape recorder) Then I get this voicemail yesterday.\n\nHe presses play. The recording is staticky and the signal was clearly breaking up.\n\nJOHN: Dean...something big is starting to happen...I need to try and figure out what's going on. It may... Be very careful, Dean. We're all in danger.\n\nDEAN presses stop.\n\nSAM: You know there's EVP on that?\n\nDEAN: Not bad, Sammy. Kinda like riding a bike, isn't it?\n\nSAM shakes his head.\n\nDEAN: All right. I slowed the message down, I ran it through a gold wave, took out the hiss, and this is what I got.\n\nHe presses play again.\n\nWOMAN: I can never go home...\n\nDEAN presses stop.\n\nSAM: Never go home.\n\nDEAN drops the recorder, puts down the shotgun, stands straight, and shuts the trunk, then leans on it.\n\nDEAN: You know, in almost two years I've never bothered you, never asked you for a thing.\n\nSAM looks away and sighs, then looks back.\n\nSAM: All right. I'll go. I'll help you find him.\n\nDEAN nods.\n\nSAM: But I have to get back first thing Monday. Just wait here.\n\nSAM turns to go back to the apartment. He turns back when DEAN speaks.\n\nDEAN: What's first thing Monday?\n\nSAM: I have this...I have an interview.\n\nDEAN: What, a job interview? Skip it.\n\nSAM: It's a law school interview, and it's my whole future on a plate.\n\nDEAN: Law school?\n\nDEAN smirks.\n\nSAM: So we got a deal or not?\n\nDEAN says nothing.\nINT. BEDROOM \u2013 NIGHT\nSAM is packing a duffel bag. He pulls out a large hook-shaped knife and slides it inside. JESS comes into the room.\n\nJESS: Wait, you're taking off?\n\nSAM looks up.\n\nJESS: Is this about your dad? Is he all right?\n\nSAM: Yeah. You know, just a little family drama.\n\nSAM goes over to the dresser and turns on the lamp atop it.\n\nJESS: Your brother said he was on some kind of hunting trip.\n\nJESS sits on the bed. SAM rummages in one of the drawers and comes out with a couple shirts, which go in the duffel.\n\nSAM: Oh, yeah, he's just deer hunting up at the cabin, he's probably got Jim, Jack, and Jos\u00e9 along with him. I'm just going to go bring him back.\n\nJESS: What about the interview?\n\nSAM: I'll make the interview. This is only for a couple days.\n\nSAM goes around the bed. JESS gets up and follows.\n\nJESS: Sam, I mean, please.\n\nSAM stops and turns.\n\nJESS: Just stop for a second. You sure you're okay?\n\nSAM laughs a little.\n\nSAM: I'm fine.\n\nJESS: It's just...you won't even talk about your family. And now you're taking off in the middle of the night to spend a weekend with them? And with Monday coming up, which is kind of a huge deal.\n\nSAM: Hey. Everything's going to be okay. I will be back in time, I promise.\n\nHe kisses her on the cheek and leaves.\n\nJESS: At least tell me where you're going.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. CENTENNIAL HIGHWAY \u2013 NIGHT\n\n[Jericho, California]\n\nThe Eagles of Death Metal's \"Speaking in Tongues\" plays. A YOUNG MAN, TROY, is driving down the highway, talking on his cell phone.\n\nTROY: Amy, I can't come over tonight. Because I've got work in the morning, that's why. ...Yeah, okay, I miss it and my dad's gonna have my ass.\n\nA high-pitched whine. TROY looks over and sees a WOMAN in a white dress on the side of the road. She's moving as though dancing; she flickers, and for a moment she's gone.\n\nTROY: Hey, ah, Amy, let me call you back?\n\nTROY tries several times to turn off the radio, which is flickering. Nothing happens. TROY pulls up next to the WOMAN, whose dress is torn in several places, and stops, leaning across the shotgun seat.\n\nTROY: Car trouble or something?\n\nA long pause.\n\nWOMAN: Take me home?\n\nThe voice is the same one from the altered voicemail. TROY opens the passenger door.\n\nTROY: Sure, get in.\n\nThe WOMAN, who is barefoot, climbs in and closes the door.\n\nTROY: So, where do you live?\n\nWOMAN: At the end of Breckenridge Road.\n\nTROY nods.\n\nTROY: You coming from a Halloween party or something?\n\nThe WOMAN's dress is very low-cut. TROY notices, stares, and looks away, laughing nervously.\n\nTROY: You know, a girl like you really shouldn't be alone out here.\n\nShe looks at him mournfully, seductively, and pulls her skirt up over her thigh.\n\nWOMAN: I'm with you.\n\nTROY looks away. The WOMAN takes TROY's chin and turns his face towards her.\n\nWOMAN: Do you think I'm pretty?\n\nTROY nods, eyes stuck on her cleavage.\n\nTROY: Uh...huh.\n\nWOMAN: Will you come home with me?\n\nTROY: Um. Hell yeah.\n\nHe drives off.\nEXT. ABANDONED HOUSE \u2013 NIGHT\nThey pull up to an old abandoned house at the end of a road. The WOMAN stares at it sadly.\n\nTROY: Come on. You don't live here.\n\nWOMAN: I can never go home.\n\nTROY: What are you talking about? Nobody even lives here. Where do you live?\n\nHe turns, and she's gone. He checks the back seat, also empty, and gets out of the car, nervous.\n\nTROY: That's good. Joke's over, okay? You want me to leave?\n\nTROY looks around: no signs of life except crickets. He walks towards the house.\n\nTROY: Hello? Hello?\n\nThere's a picture of the WOMAN and two CHILDREN inside the house; the picture is covered in dust. TROY peers through the hole in the screen door. A bird flies at his face, scaring him into falling over. He yells, leaps to his feet, and runs back to the car. He gets in and drives off.\nEXT. CENTENNIAL HIGHWAY \u2013 NIGHT\nTROY looks behind him\u2014no one's there\u2014then in the rearview mirror. The WOMAN is in the back seat. TROY yells again and drives straight through a \"Bridge Closed\" sign, stopping about halfway across the bridge. He screams. Blood spatters the windows.ACT TWOEXT. GAS STATION \u2013 DAY\nThe Impala is parked in front of a pump. \"Ramblin' Man\" by the Allman Brothers plays. DEAN comes out of the convenience mart carrying junk food. SAM is sitting in the shotgun seat with the door open, rifling through a box of tapes.\n\nDEAN: Hey!\n\nSAM leans out and looks at him.\n\nDEAN: You want breakfast?\n\nSAM: No, thanks. So how'd you pay for that stuff? You and Dad still running credit card scams?\n\nDEAN: Yeah, well, hunting ain't exactly a pro ball career. (puts the nozzle back on the pump) Besides, all we do is apply. It's not our fault they send us the cards.\n\nSAM: Yeah? And what names did you write on the application this time?\n\nSAM swings his legs back inside the car and closes the door.\n\nDEAN: Uh, Burt Aframian. (gets into the driver seat and puts his soda and chips down) And his son Hector. Scored two cards out of the deal.\n\nDEAN closes the door.\n\nSAM: That sounds about right. I swear, man, you've gotta update your cassette tape collection.\n\nThere are at least a dozen cassettes in the box on SAM's lap; some have album art, others are hand-labeled.\n\nDEAN: Why?\n\nSAM: Well, for one, they're cassette tapes. And two. (holds up a tape for every band he names) Black Sabbath? Motorhead? Metallica?\n\nDEAN takes the box labeled Metallica from SAM.\n\nSAM: It's the greatest hits of mullet rock.\n\nDEAN: Well, house rules, Sammy. (pops the tape in the player) Driver picks the music, shotgun shuts his cakehole.\n\nDEAN drops the Metallica box back in the box of tapes and starts the engine.\n\nSAM: You know, Sammy is a chubby twelve-year-old.\n\nAC/DC's \"Back in Black\" begins to play.\n\nSAM: It's Sam, okay?\n\nDEAN: Sorry, I can't hear you, the music's too loud.\n\nDEAN drives off.\nEXT. CENTENNIAL HIGHWAY \u2013 DAY\nThey drive past a sign that says \"JERICHO 7\". Sam is talking on his cell phone.\n\nSAM: Thank you.\n\nSAM closes his phone.\n\nSAM: All right. So, there's no one matching Dad at the hospital or morgue. So that's something, I guess.\n\nDEAN glances over at SAM, then back at the road. At a bridge ahead of them, there are two police cars and several officers.\n\nDEAN: Check it out.\n\nSAM leans forward for a closer look. DEAN pulls over. They take a long look before DEAN turns off the engine. Kid Gloves Music's \"My Cheatin' Ways\" begins to play. DEAN opens the glove compartment and pulls out a box full of ID cards with his and JOHN's faces: visible ones include FBI and DEA. He picks one out and grins at SAM, who stares.\n\nDEAN: Let's go.\n\nDEAN gets out of the car. On the bridge, the lead DEPUTY, DEPUTY JAFFE, leans over the railing to yell down to two MEN in wetsuits who were poking around the river.\n\nJAFFE: You guys find anything?\n\nMAN: No! Nothing!\n\nJAFFE turns back to the car in the middle of the bridge. It's familiar: it's TROY's, the blood gone. Another DEPUTY, DEPUTY HEIN, is at the driver's side looking around inside the car.\n\nHEIN: No sign of struggle, no footprints, no fingerprints. Spotless. It's almost too clean.\n\nDEAN and SAM walk into the crime scene like they belong there.\n\nJAFFE: So, this kid Troy. He's dating your daughter, isn't he?\n\nHEIN: Yeah.\n\nJAFFE: How's Amy doing?\n\nHEIN: She's putting up missing posters downtown.\n\nDEAN: You fellas had another one like this just last month, didn't you?\n\nJAFFE looks up when DEAN starts talking and straightens up to talk to him.\n\nJAFFE: And who are you?\n\nDEAN flashes his badge.\n\nDEAN: Federal marshals.\n\nJAFFE: You two are a little young for marshals, aren't you?\n\nDEAN laughs.\n\nDEAN: Thanks, that's awfully kind of you. (goes over to the car) You did have another one just like this, correct?\n\nJAFFE: Yeah, that's right. About a mile up the road. There've been others before that.\n\nSAM: So, this victim, you knew him?\n\nJAFFE nods.\n\nJAFFE: Town like this, everybody knows everybody.\n\nDEAN circles the car, looking around.\n\nDEAN: Any connection between the victims, besides that they're all men?\n\nJAFFE: No. Not so far as we can tell.\n\nSAM: So what's the theory?\n\nSAM goes over to DEAN.\n\nJAFFE: Honestly, we don't know. Serial murder? Kidnapping ring?\n\nDEAN: Well, that is exactly the kind of crack police work I'd expect out of you guys.\n\nSAM stomps on DEAN's foot.\n\nSAM: Thank you for your time.\n\nSAM starts to walk away. DEAN follows.\n\nSAM: Gentlemen.\n\nJAFFE watches them go. DEAN smacks SAM on the head.\n\nSAM: Ow! What was that for?\n\nDEAN: Why'd you have to step on my foot?\n\nSAM: Why do you have to talk to the police like that?\n\nDEAN looks at SAM and moves in front of him, forcing SAM to stop walking.\n\nDEAN: Come on. They don't really know what's going on. We're all alone on this. I mean, if we're going to find Dad we've got to get to the bottom of this thing ourselves.\n\nSAM clears his throat and looks over DEAN's shoulder. DEAN turns. It's SHERIFF PIERCE and two FBI AGENTS.\n\nSHERIFF: Can I help you boys?\n\nDEAN: No, sir, we were just leaving.\n\nAs the FBI AGENTS walk past DEAN, he nods at each of them.\n\nDEAN: Agent Mulder. Agent Scully.\n\nDEAN and SAM head past the SHERIFF, who turns to watch them go.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. STREET \u2013 DAY\nThe marquee on the Highland Movie Theater reads:\nEMERGENCY TOWN HALL MEETING\nSUNDAY 8 PM\nBE SAFE OUT THERE\n\nA YOUNG WOMAN is tacking up posters with TROY's face and the caption \"MISSING TROY SQUIRE\". DEAN and SAM approach.\n\nDEAN: I'll bet you that's her.\n\nSAM: Yeah.\n\nDEAN and SAM walk up to the YOUNG WOMAN.\n\nDEAN: You must be Amy.\n\nAMY: Yeah.\n\nDEAN: Yeah, Troy told us about you. We're his uncles. I'm Dean, this is Sammy.\n\nAMY: He never mentioned you to me.\n\nAMY walks away. DEAN and SAM walk with her.\n\nDEAN: Well, that's Troy, I guess. We're not around much, we're up in Modesto.\n\nSAM: So, we're looking for him too, and we're kinda asking around.\n\nAnother YOUNG WOMAN, RACHEL, comes up to AMY and puts a hand on her arm.\n\nRACHEL: Hey, are you okay?\n\nAMY: Yeah.\n\nSAM: You mind if we ask you a couple questions?\n\nAnother poster that says MISSING TROY SQUIRE flaps in the breeze.\nINT. DINER \u2013 DAY\nThe four of them are sitting in a booth, DEAN and SAM opposite AMY and RACHEL.\n\nAMY: I was on the phone with Troy. He was driving home. He said he would call me right back, and...he never did.\n\nSAM: He didn't say anything strange, or out of the ordinary?\n\nAMY shakes her head.\n\nAMY: No. Nothing I can remember.\n\nSAM: I like your necklace.\n\nAMY holds the pendant she's wearing, a pentagram in a circle, and looks down at it.\n\nAMY: Troy gave it to me. Mostly to scare my parents\u2014 (laughs) \u2014with all that devil stuff.\n\nSAM laughs a little and looks down, then up. DEAN looks over.\n\nSAM: Actually, it means just the opposite. A pentagram is protection against evil. Really powerful. I mean, if you believe in that kind of thing.\n\nDEAN: Okay. Thank you, Unsolved Mysteries. (takes his arm off the back of SAM's seat and leans forward) Here's the deal, ladies. The way Troy disappeared, something's not right. So if you've heard anything...\n\nAMY and RACHEL look at each other.\n\nDEAN: What is it?\n\nRACHEL: Well, it's just... I mean, with all these guys going missing, people talk.\n\nDEAN and SAM speak in chorus.\n\nDEAN and SAM: What do they talk about?\n\nRACHEL: It's kind of this local legend. This one girl? She got murdered out on Centennial, like decades ago.\n\nDEAN looks at SAM, who watches RACHEL attentively, nodding.\n\nRACHEL: Well, supposedly she's still out there.\n\nSAM nods.\n\nRACHEL: She hitchhikes, and whoever picks her up? Well, they disappear forever.\n\nSAM and DEAN look at each other.\nINT. LIBRARY \u2013 DAY\nA web browser is open to the archive search page for the Jericho Herald. The words \"Female Murder Hitchhiking\" are typed into the search box. DEAN clicks GO; the screen tells him there are \"(0) Result\". DEAN replaces \"Hitchhiking\" with \"Centennial Highway\" with the same response. SAM is sitting next to him, watching.\n\nSAM: Let me try.\n\nDEAN smacks SAM's hand.\n\nDEAN: I got it.\n\nSAM shoves DEAN's chair out of the way and takes over.\n\nDEAN: Dude! (hits SAM in the shoulder) You're such a control freak.\n\nSAM: So angry spirits are born out of violent death, right?\n\nDEAN: Yeah.\n\nSAM: Well, maybe it's not murder.\n\nSAM replaces \"Murder\" with \"Suicide\" and finds an article entitled \"Suicide on Centennial\". DEAN glances at SAM. SAM opens the article, dated April 25, 1981.\n\nSAM: This was 1981. Constance Welch, twenty-four years old, jumps off Sylvania Bridge, drowns in the river.\n\nThere's a picture of CONSTANCE; it's the WOMAN who killed TROY.\n\nDEAN: Does it say why she did it?\n\nSAM: Yeah.\n\nDEAN: What?\n\nSAM: An hour before they found her, she calls 911. Apparently her two little kids are in the bathtub. She leaves them alone for a minute, and when she comes back, they aren't breathing. Both die.\n\nDEAN raises his eyebrows.\n\nDEAN: Hm.\n\nThe article has a picture of Joseph next to a picture of Sylvania Bridge; it's the place TROY died.\n\nSAM: \"'Our babies were gone, and Constance just couldn't bear it,' said husband Joseph Welch.\"\n\nDEAN: The bridge look familiar to you?\n\nEXT. SYLVANIA BRIDGE \u2013 NIGHT\nDEAN and SAM walk along the bridge, then stop to lean on the railing and look down at the river.\n\nDEAN: So this is where Constance took the swan dive.\n\nSAM: So you think Dad would have been here?\n\nSAM looks over at DEAN.\n\nDEAN: Well, he's chasing the same story and we're chasing him.\n\nDEAN continues walking. SAM follows.\n\nSAM: Okay, so now what?\n\nDEAN: Now we keep digging until we find him. Might take a while.\n\nSAM stops.\n\nSAM: Dean, I told you, I've gotta get back by Monday\u2014\n\nDEAN turns around.\n\nDEAN: Monday. Right. The interview.\n\nSAM: Yeah.\n\nDEAN: Yeah, I forgot. You're really serious about this, aren't you? You think you're just going to become some lawyer? Marry your girl?\n\nSAM: Maybe. Why not?\n\nDEAN: Does Jessica know the truth about you? I mean, does she know about the things you've done?\n\nSAM steps closer.\n\nSAM: No, and she's not ever going to know.\n\nDEAN: Well, that's healthy. You can pretend all you want, Sammy. But sooner or later you're going to have to face up to who you really are.\n\nDEAN turns around and keeps walking. SAM follows.\n\nSAM: And who's that?\n\nDEAN: You're one of us.\n\nSAM hurries to get in front of DEAN.\n\nSAM: No. I'm not like you. This is not going to be my life.\n\nDEAN: You have a responsibility to\u2014\n\nSAM: To Dad? And his crusade? If it weren't for pictures I wouldn't even know what Mom looks like. And what difference would it make? Even if we do find the thing that killed her, Mom's gone. And she isn't coming back.\n\nDEAN grabs SAM by the collar and shoves him up against the railing of the bridge. A long pause.\n\nDEAN: Don't talk about her like that.\n\nDEAN releases SAM and walks away. He sees CONSTANCE standing at the edge of the bridge.\n\nDEAN: Sam.\n\nSAM comes to stand next to DEAN. CONSTANCE looks over at them, then steps forward off the edge. SAM and DEAN run to the railing and look over.\n\nDEAN: Where'd she go?\n\nSAM: I don't know.\n\nBehind them, the Impala's engine starts and its headlights come on. DEAN and SAM turn to look.\n\nDEAN: What the\u2014\n\nSAM: Who's driving your car?\n\nDEAN pulls the keys out of his pocket and jingles them. SAM glances at them. The car jerks into motion, heading straight for them. They turn and run.\n\nSAM: Dean? Go! Go!\n\nThe car is moving faster than they are; when it gets too close, SAM and DEAN dive over the railing. The car comes to a halt.ACT THREEEXT. SYLVANIA BRIDGE \u2013 NIGHT\nSAM has caught himself on the edge of the bridge and is hanging on. He pulls himself up onto the bridge and looks around.\n\nSAM: Dean? Dean!\n\nBelow, a filthy and annoyed DEAN crawls out of the water and onto the mud, panting.\n\nDEAN: What?\n\nSAM: Hey! Are you all right?\n\nDEAN holds up one hand in an A-OK sign.\n\nDEAN: I'm super.\n\nSAM laughs, relieved, and scoots away from the edge.\nEXT. SYLVANIA BRIDGE \u2013 NIGHT, LATER\nDEAN shuts the hood of his car and leans on it.\n\nSAM: Your car all right?\n\nDEAN: Yeah, whatever she did to it, seems all right now. That Constance chick, what a bitch!\n\nSAM: Well, she doesn't want us digging around, that's for sure. So where's the job go from here, genius?\n\nSAM settles on the hood next to DEAN. DEAN throws up his arms in frustration, then flicks mud off his hands. SAM sniffs, then looks at DEAN.\n\nSAM: You smell like a toilet.\n\nDEAN looks down.\n\nCUT TO: INT. MOTEL LOBBY \u2013 DAY\nA VersaBank MasterCard in the name of Hector Aframian lands on a handwritten guest ledger.\n\nDEAN: One room, please.\n\nDEAN is standing at the motel check-in desk, still filthy, with SAM right behind him. The CLERK picks up the card and looks at it.\n\nCLERK: You guys having a reunion or something?\n\nSAM: What do you mean?\n\nCLERK: I had another guy, Burt Aframian. He came and bought out a room for the whole month.\n\nDEAN looks back at SAM.\nINT. MOTEL ROOM \u2013 DAY\nThe motel door swings open. SAM is on the other side, having just picked the lock. SAM hides the picks and stands up. DEAN is just outside, playing lookout, until SAM reaches out of the room to grab his shoulder and yank him inside. SAM closes the door behind them. They look around\u2014every vertical surface has papers pinned to it: maps, newspaper clippings, pictures, notes. There are books on the desk and assorted junk on the floor and bed, including something with a hazardous-materials symbol.\n\nSAM: Whoa.\n\nDEAN turns on a light by the bed and picks up a half-eaten hamburger sitting there. SAM steps over a line of salt on the floor. DEAN sniffs the burger and recoils.\n\nDEAN: I don't think he's been here for a couple days at least.\n\nSAM fingers the salt on the floor and looks up.\n\nSAM: Salt, cats-eye shells...he was worried. Trying to keep something from coming in.\n\nDEAN looks at the papers covering one wall.\n\nSAM: What have you got here?\n\nDEAN: Centennial Highway victims.\n\nSAM nods. The victims seen on the wall include Mark somebody, William Durrell, Scott Nifong who disappeared in 1987 at age 25, and somebody Parks. Mark, Durrell, and Nifong are all white males, judging by the photos.\n\nDEAN: I don't get it. I mean, different men, different jobs\u2014\n\nSAM crosses the room.\n\nDEAN: \u2014ages, ethnicities. There's always a connection, right? What do these guys have in common?\n\nWhile DEAN talks, SAM looks at the papers taped to the other walls. There's something about the Bell Witch, two people being burned alive, a skeletal person blowing a horn at several scared people with the note \"MORTIS DANSE\", a column about \"Devils + Demons\", another about \"Sirens, Witches, the possessed\", a wooden pentacle, and a note that says \"Woman in White\" above a printout of the Jericho Herald article on CONSTANCE's suicide. SAM turns on another lamp.\n\nSAM: Dad figured it out.\n\nDEAN turns to look.\n\nDEAN: What do you mean?\n\nSAM: He found the same article we did. Constance Welch. She's a woman in white.\n\nDEAN looks at the photos of CONSTANCE's victims.\n\nDEAN: You sly dogs. (turns back to SAM) All right, so if we're dealing with a woman in white, Dad would have found the corpse and destroyed it.\n\nSAM: She might have another weakness.\n\nDEAN: Well, Dad would want to make sure. (crosses to SAM) He'd dig her up. Does it say where she's buried?\n\nSAM: No, not that I can tell. If I were Dad, though, I'd go ask her husband.\n\nSAM taps the picture of JOSEPH WELCH. The caption says he's thirty; the article dates to 1981, so he must be sixty-four.\n\nSAM: If he's still alive.\n\nSAM goes to look at something else. DEAN looks at the picture below the Herald article, of a woman in a white dress.\n\nDEAN: All right. Why don't you, uh, see if you can find an address, I'm gonna get cleaned up.\n\nDEAN starts to walk away. SAM turns.\n\nSAM: Hey, Dean?\n\nDEAN stops and turns back.\n\nSAM: What I said earlier, about Mom and Dad, I'm sorry.\n\nDEAN holds up a hand.\n\nDEAN: No chick-flick moments.\n\nSAM laughs and nods.\n\nSAM: All right. Jerk.\n\nDEAN: Bitch.\n\nSAM laughs again. DEAN disappears, presumably into the bathroom. SAM notices something, his smile disappearing, and crosses over for a closer look. A rosary hangs in front of a large mirror, and stuck into the mirror frame is a photo of JOHN sitting on the hood of the Impala, next to a BOY in a baseball cap who is presumably DEAN and with a YOUNGER BOY, presumably SAM, on JOHN's lap. SAM takes the photo off the mirror and holds it, smiling sadly.\nINT. MOTEL ROOM \u2013 DAY, LATER\nSAM paces, holding his phone, and sits down on the bed. A voicemail message is playing.\n\nJESS: Hey, it's me, it's about ten-twenty Saturday night\u2014\n\nDEAN, clean again, comes out of the bathroom and grabs his jacket. He shrugs it on one shoulder as he crosses the room.\n\nDEAN: Hey, man. I'm starving, I'm gonna grab a little something to eat in that diner down the street. You want anything?\n\nSAM: No.\n\nDEAN: Aframian's buying.\n\nSAM shakes his head.\n\nSAM: Mm-mm.\n\nEXT. PARKING LOT \u2013 DAY\nDEAN leaves the motel room. He gets the jacket the rest of the way on as he crosses the lot. He looks over and sees a police car, where the MOTEL CLERK is talking to DEPUTY JAFFE and DEPUTY HEIN. The CLERK points at DEAN, who turns away and pulls out his cell phone.\nINT. MOTEL ROOM \u2013 DAY and EXT. PARKING LOT \u2013 DAY, alternating\nSAM is sitting on the bed, still listening to the message.\n\nJESS: So come home soon, okay? I love you.\n\nThe phone beeps. SAM looks at it and presses a button, then puts it back to his ear.\n\nSAM: What?\n\nOutside, the DEPUTIES are approaching DEAN.\n\nDEAN: Dude, five-oh, take off.\n\nSAM stands up.\n\nSAM: What about you?\n\nDEAN: Uh, they kinda spotted me. Go find Dad.\n\nDEAN hangs up the phone as the DEPUTIES approach. He turns and grins at them.\n\nDEAN: Problem, officers?\n\nJAFFE: Where's your partner?\n\nDEAN: Partner? What, what partner?\n\nJAFFE glances over his shoulder and jerks his thumb towards the motel room. HEIN heads over there. DEAN fidgets. SAM sees HEIN approaching and darts away from the window.\n\nJAFFE: So. Fake US Marshal. Fake credit cards. You got anything that's real?\n\nDEAN: My boobs.\n\nDEAN grins. HEIN slams Dean over the hood of the cop car.\n\nJAFFE: You have the right to remain silent\u2014ACT FOURINT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE \u2013 DAY\nSHERIFF PIERCE enters the room, carrying a box. He sets the box on the table at which DEAN sits and goes around the table to face DEAN across it.\n\nSHERIFF: So you want to give us your real name?\n\nDEAN: I told you, it's Nugent. Ted Nugent.\n\nSHERIFF: I'm not sure you realize just how much trouble you're in here.\n\nDEAN: We talkin', like, misdemeanor kind of trouble or, uh, squeal like a pig trouble?\n\nSHERIFF: You got the faces of ten missing persons taped to your wall.\n\nDEAN looks away.\n\nSHERIFF: Along with a whole lot of Satanic mumbo-jumbo. Boy, you are officially a suspect.\n\nDEAN: That makes sense. Because when the first one went missing in '82 I was three.\n\nSHERIFF: I know you've got partners. One of 'em's an older guy. Maybe he started the whole thing. So tell me. Dean.\n\nThe SHERIFF tosses a brown leather-covered journal on the table.\n\nSHERIFF: This his?\n\nDEAN stares at it. The SHERIFF sits on the edge of the table. He flips through the journal: it's filled with newspaper clippings, notes, and pictures, just like what's on the walls of JOHN's motel room.\n\nSHERIFF: I thought that might be your name. See, I leafed through this. What little I could make out\u2014I mean, it's nine kinds of crazy.\n\nDEAN leans forward for a closer look.\n\nSHERIFF: But I found this, too.\n\nHe opens the journal to a page that reads \"DEAN 35-111\", circled, with nothing else on that page.\n\nSHERIFF: Now. You're stayin' right here till you tell me exactly what the hell that means.\n\nDEAN stares down at the page, then looks up.\n\nCUT TO: INT. HOUSE \u2013 DAY\nSAM, seen through the chain-link covering a grimy glass window, knocks on the door the window is in. An OLD MAN opens it: it's recognizably JOSEPH WELCH.\n\nSAM: Hi. Are you Joseph Welch?\n\nJOSEPH: Yeah.\n\nEXT. DRIVEWAY \u2013 DAY\nSAM and JOSEPH are walking down the junk-filled driveway, JOSEPH holding the photo SAM found on JOHN's motel room mirror.\n\nJOSEPH: Yeah, he was older, but that's him. (hands the photo back to SAM) He came by three or four days ago. Said he was a reporter.\n\nSAM: That's right. We're working on a story together.\n\nJOSEPH: Well, I don't know what the hell kinda story you're working on. The questions he asked me?\n\nSAM: About your wife Constance?\n\nJOSEPH: He asked me where she was buried.\n\nSAM: And where is that again?\n\nJOSEPH: What, I gotta go through this twice?\n\nSAM: It's fact-checking. If you don't mind.\n\nJOSEPH: In a plot. Behind my old place over on Breckenridge.\n\nSAM: And why did you move?\n\nJOSEPH: I'm not gonna live in the house where my children died.\n\nSAM stops walking. JOSEPH stops too.\n\nSAM: Mr. Welch, did you ever marry again?\n\nJOSEPH: No way. Constance, she was the love of my life. Prettiest woman I ever known.\n\nSAM: So you had a happy marriage?\n\nJOSEPH hesitates.\n\nJOSEPH: Definitely.\n\nSAM: Well, that should do it. Thanks for your time.\n\nSAM turns toward the Impala. JOSEPH walks away. SAM waits a moment, then looks back up at JOSEPH.\n\nSAM: Mr. Welch, did you ever hear of a woman in white?\n\nJOSEPH turns around.\n\nJOSEPH: A what?\n\nSAM: A woman in white. Or sometimes weeping woman?\n\nJOSEPH just looks.\n\nSAM: It's a ghost story. Well, it's more of a phenomenon, really. (starts back toward JOSEPH) Um, they're spirits. They've been sighted for hundreds of years, dozens of places, in Hawaii, Mexico, lately in Arizona, Indiana. All these are different women. (stops in front of JOSEPH) You understand. But all share the same story.\n\nJOSEPH: Boy, I don't care much for nonsense.\n\nJOSEPH walks away. SAM follows.\n\nSAM: See, when they were alive, their husbands were unfaithful to them.\n\nJOSEPH stops.\n\nSAM: And these women, basically suffering from temporary insanity, murdered their children.\n\nJOSEPH turns around.\n\nSAM: Then once they realized what they had done, they took their own lives. So now their spirits are cursed, walking back roads, waterways. And if they find an unfaithful man, they kill him. And that man is never seen again.\n\nJOSEPH: You think...you think that has something to do with...Constance? You smartass!\n\nSAM: You tell me.\n\nJOSEPH: I mean, maybe...maybe I made some mistakes. But no matter what I did, Constance, she never would have killed her own children. Now, you get the hell out of here! And you don't come back!\n\nJOSEPH's face shakes, whether from anger or grief it's impossible to tell. After a long moment, he turns away. SAM sighs.\n\nCUT TO: INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE \u2013 NIGHT\n\nDEAN: I don't know how many times I gotta tell you. It's my high school locker combo.\n\nSHERIFF PIERCE is still interrogating DEAN over the \"DEAN 35-111\" page.\n\nSHERIFF: We gonna do this all night long?\n\nA DEPUTY leans into the room.\n\nDEPUTY: We just got a 911, shots fired over at Whiteford Road.\n\nSHERIFF: You have to go to the bathroom?\n\nDEAN: No.\n\nSHERIFF: Good.\n\nThe SHERIFF handcuffs Dean to the table and leaves. DEAN sees a paper clip poking out of the journal, pulls it out, and looks at it. Moments later, as the SHERIFF and DEPUTY are gearing up to leave, he is out of the cuffs. DEAN watches through the window in the door, ducks out of sight as the DEPUTY approaches the door, and waits.\nEXT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE \u2013 NIGHT\nDEAN climbs down the fire escape, carrying JOHN's journal.\nEXT. HIGHWAY \u2013 NIGHT and EXT. STREET \u2013 NIGHT, alternating\nSAM is driving the IMPALA when his phone rings. He pulls it out and answers it. DEAN is in a phone booth; apparently his phone was confiscated and he didn't take the time to steal it back.\n\nDEAN: Fake 911 phone call? Sammy, I don't know, that's pretty illegal.\n\nSAM: You're welcome.\n\nSAM grins.\n\nDEAN: Listen, we gotta talk.\n\nSAM: Tell me about it. So the husband was unfaithful. We are dealing with a woman in white. And she's buried behind her old house, so that should have been Dad's next stop.\n\nDEAN: Sammy, would you shut up for a second?\n\nSAM: I just can't figure out why Dad hasn't destroyed the corpse yet.\n\nDEAN: Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you. He's gone. Dad left Jericho.\n\nSAM: What? How do you know?\n\nDEAN: I've got his journal.\n\nSAM: He doesn't go anywhere without that thing.\n\nDEAN: Yeah, well, he did this time.\n\nSAM: What's it say?\n\nDEAN: Ah, the same old ex-Marine crap, when he wants to let us know where he's going.\n\nSAM: Coordinates. Where to?\n\nDEAN: I'm not sure yet.\n\nSAM: I don't understand. I mean, what could be so important that Dad would just skip out in the middle of a job? Dean, what the hell is going on?\n\nSAM looks up and slams the brake, dropping the phone: CONSTANCE appeared on the road in front of him. The car goes right through her as SAM brings it to a halt.\n\nDEAN: Sam? Sam!\n\nInside the car, SAM breathes hard. CONSTANCE is sitting in the back seat.\n\nCONSTANCE: Take me home.ACT FIVEEXT. HIGHWAY \u2013 NIGHT\n\nCONSTANCE: Take me home!\n\nSAM: No.\n\nCONSTANCE glares and the doors lock themselves. SAM struggles to reopen them. The gas pedal presses down and the car begins to drive itself. SAM tries to steer, but CONSTANCE is doing that too. SAM continues to try to get the door open. In the back seat, CONSTANCE flickers.\nEXT. ABANDONED HOUSE \u2013 NIGHT\nThe car pulls up in front of CONSTANCE's house and stops. The engine shuts off and so do the lights.\n\nSAM: Don't do this.\n\nCONSTANCE flickers. Her voice is sad.\n\nCONSTANCE: I can never go home.\n\nSAM: You're scared to go home.\n\nSAM looks back and CONSTANCE isn't there. He glances around and back and sees her in the shotgun seat. She climbs into his lap, shoving him back against the seat hard enough to recline the seat. SAM struggles.\n\nCONSTANCE: Hold me. I'm so cold.\n\nSAM: You can't kill me. I'm not unfaithful. I've never been!\n\nCONSTANCE: You will be. Just hold me.\n\nCONSTANCE kisses SAM as he continues to struggle, reaching for the keys. She pulls back and disappears, a flash of something horrible behind her face as she vanishes. SAM looks around for a moment, then yells in pain and yanks his hoodie open. There are five new holes burned through the fabric, matching to CONSTANCE's fingers: she flickers in front of him, her hand reaching into his chest. A gunshot goes off, shattering the window and startling CONSTANCE. DEAN approaches, still firing at her. She glares at him and vanishes, then reappears, and DEAN keeps firing until she disappears again. SAM manages to sit up and start the car.\n\nSAM: I'm taking you home.\n\nSAM drives forward. DEAN stares after the car. SAM smashes through the side of the house. DEAN hurries through the wreckage to the passenger side of the car.\n\nDEAN: Sam! Sam! You okay?\n\nSAM: I think...\n\nDEAN: Can you move?\n\nSAM: Yeah. Help me?\n\nDEAN leans through the window to give SAM a hand. CONSTANCE picks up a large framed photograph seen when she brought TROY here: the WOMAN is CONSTANCE and the children are presumably hers. DEAN helps SAM out of the car.\n\nDEAN: There you go.\n\nDEAN closes the car door. They look around and see CONSTANCE; she looks up. She glares at them and throws the picture down. A bureau scoots towards SAM and DEAN, pinning them against the car. The lights flicker; CONSTANCE looks around, scared. Water begins to pour down the staircase. She goes over. At the top are the BOY and GIRL from the photograph. They hold hands and speak in chorus.\n\nCHILDREN: You've come home to us, Mommy.\n\nCONSTANCE looks at them, distraught. Suddenly they are behind her; they embrace her tightly and she screams, her image flickering. In a surge of energy, still screaming, CONSTANCE and the two CHILDREN melt into a puddle in the floor. SAM and DEAN shove the bureau over and go look at the spot where CONSTANCE and her CHILDREN vanished.\n\nDEAN: So this is where she drowned her kids.\n\nSAM nods.\n\nSAM: That's why she could never go home. She was too scared to face them.\n\nDEAN: You found her weak spot. Nice work, Sammy.\n\nHe slaps SAM on the chest where he's been injured and walks away. SAM laughs through the pain.\n\nSAM: Yeah, I wish I could say the same for you. What were you thinking shooting Casper in the face, you freak?\n\nDEAN: Hey. Saved your ass.\n\n\"Highway to Hell\" by AC/DC begins to play. DEAN leans over to look at the car.\n\nDEAN: I'll tell you another thing. If you screwed up my car? (twists around to look at SAM) I'll kill you.\n\nSAM laughs.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. HIGHWAY \u2013 NIGHT\nThe Impala tears down the road; the right headlight is out. SAM has the journal open to \"DEAN 35-111\" and a map open on his lap and is finding coordinates with a ruler, a flashlight tucked between chin and shoulder.\n\nSAM: Okay, here's where Dad went. It's called Blackwater Ridge, Colorado.\n\nDEAN nods.\n\nDEAN: Sounds charming. How far?\n\nSAM: About six hundred miles.\n\nDEAN: Hey, if we shag ass we could make it by morning.\n\nSAM looks at him, hesitating.\n\nSAM: Dean, I, um...\n\nDEAN glances at the road and back.\n\nDEAN: You're not going.\n\nSAM: The interview's in like, ten hours. I gotta be there.\n\nDEAN nods, disappointed, and returns his attention to the road.\n\nDEAN: Yeah. Yeah, whatever. (glances at SAM) I'll take you home.\n\nSAM turns the flashlight off. They drive on.\n\nCUT TO: EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT BUILDING \u2013 NIGHT\nThey pull up in front of the apartment, DEAN still frowning. SAM gets out and leans over to look through the window.\n\nSAM: Call me if you find him?\n\nDEAN nods.\n\nSAM: And maybe I can meet up with you later, huh?\n\nDEAN: Yeah, all right.\n\nSAM pats the car door twice and turns away. DEAN leans toward the passenger door, one arm going over the back of the seat.\n\nDEAN: Sam?\n\nSAM turns back.\n\nDEAN: You know, we made a hell of a team back there.\n\nSAM: Yeah.\n\nDEAN drives off. SAM watches him go and sighs.\nINT. SAM'S APARTMENT \u2013 NIGHT\nSAM lets himself in. Everything is dark and quiet.\n\nSAM: Jess? (closes the door) You home?\n\nSAM notices a plate of chocolate chip cookies on the table, with a note that reads \"Missed you! Love you!\", next to a National Geographic. SAM picks one up and eats it as he sneaks into the bedroom, smiling. The shower is audibly running. SAM sits on the bed, shuts his eyes, and flops onto his back. Blood drips onto SAM's forehead, one drop, then another; he flinches and opens his eyes. He gasps in horror: JESS is pinned to the ceiling, staring down at him and bleeding from the belly.\n\nSAM: No!\n\nJESS bursts into flame; the fire spreads across the ceiling. DEAN kicks the front door open.\n\nDEAN: Sam!\n\nSAM raises one arm to shield his face.\n\nSAM: Jess!\n\nDEAN comes running into the bedroom.\n\nDEAN: Sam! Sam!\n\nDEAN looks up and sees JESS.\n\nSAM: No! No!\n\nDEAN grabs SAM off the bed and bodily shoves him out the door, SAM struggling all the way.\n\nSAM: Jess! Jess! No!\n\nFlames engulf the apartment.\nEXT. SAM'S APARTMENT \u2013 NIGHT\nIn a scene much like the end of the flashback, a fire truck is parked outside the building, firemen and police keeping back gawkers. DEAN looks on, then turns and walks back to his car. SAM is standing behind the open trunk, loading a shotgun. DEAN looks at the trunk, then at SAM, whose face is set in a mask of desperate anger. SAM looks up, then sighs, nods, and tosses the shotgun into the trunk.\n\nSAM: We got work to do.\n\nSAM shuts the trunk.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/326125",

Before this record ends, six hundred seconds will have passed and the miracle will have occurred. But before we meet this miracle, let's first turn time backwards. It is 5000 BC. Look around. See how there is nothing here to listen to. No radio, no television, no phonograph, nothing but the wind and the rain. The rhythm of the wind, the beat of the raindrops. See how man listens to that, and now see how he starts to create strange rhythmic sounds of his own \u2014 sounds that excite his emotions. (*Percussiv\u0435 music and chanting*) You are here in 5000 BC, obs\u0435rving the beginnings of music. Now, let's turn time forward. We are back in modern-day civilization, and music is still with man. But listen to how it has developed since the time of its beginning. Now, music has become an inseparable part of each man's life \u2014 the expression of all of his emotions from the moment he makes his entrance on Earth to the time that he departs.\n\nMother: *Humming and indistinct singing* When he opened his eyes for the first time, I comforted my child with a lullaby. He didn't understand the words, but he felt the warmth, the love.\n\nTeacher: I was his grade school teacher. I led him in singing to the music of his country. It gave him the feeling of being part of something bigger than his home, his street, his town.\n\nChoir 1: Sweet land of liberty\nOf thee I sing\nLand where my fathers died\nLand of\u2026\nChurch vocalist: Ooh\nOoh\n\nMinister: I was his minister. When he was still a boy, he found in music the strength, the serenity of the greatest entity of all.\n\nMan 1: I was that boy. Music has always been a part of my life. The seasons have come and gone and I'm older. Now, it's the times like Christmas and New Year's, the times when I'm together with my family and my friends, that I feel the closest to music. There's something about music you can't explain \u2014 something almost magical about the way it can affect a person's feelings.\n\nChoir 2: For auld lang syne, my dear\nFor auld lang syne\n\nNarrator: One hundred and sixty seconds have elapsed. Four hundred and fifty seconds remain, and then the miracle. In the meanwhile, let's turn time to 1955. (*Chatter*) It is 1955, and the meeting is being held that will introduce possibly the most important development in music since the time man originated his first rhythmic sounds.\n\nMagnus meeting leader: (*Gavel bangs*) Gentlemen, you've all heard the rumors. They say we at Magnus have a development that can change the concept of music. Well, the rumors are true. You, Jim. Why do you think most people through the ages have listened to music rather than experienced the thrill of playing it?\n\nJim: Well, it takes too much aptitude, too much study and time for the average person to learn to play an instrument. Guess it's something for the gifted few \u2014 the musicians.\n\nMagnus meeting leader: How about the electric organ? You, Bob. How long would you say it would take to learn to play that?\n\nBob: Well, I'd say the longest time of any instrument. Months, maybe years.\n\nMagnus meeting leader: What would you say if I told you that, with this new Magnus electric chord organ standing here, I can change the music habits of America? That I can bring millions the experience, the thrill, of not just listening to music, but of actually playing it? Gentlemen, with this new development, any man, woman, or child will be able to play music in ten minutes on the grandest of all instruments \u2014 the organ \u2014 and to play almost as if they were a concert artist. Impossible? Yes, I know it sounds that way, but here's Fred Phillips to show you how this is not only possible, but how it is already a proven reality.\n\nFred Phillips: Thank you. Like most great things, our development is very simple. It completely eliminates the need for reading music, for studying, for lessons, for special skills. See how these music sheets have a number over each note and an alphabetical letter over each chord, and see how there are the same numbers and alphabetical letters on the keyboard of this Magnus organ. Now watch. We'll start from the top. It shows on the music sheet number six, so I push down number six. Now five, then four, then five, six, and eight, and now I add the letter F, add C, I'm playing! Now you fellers know, if anyone can't read a note of music, it's me. And here I am playing music on the most intricate instrument of all, the organ. It's really and truly as simple as that. See for yourself. Can you imagine what this will do to bring the full experience of music to all the millions of non-musicians everywhere?\n\nNarrator: Three hundred and seventy-five seconds have now passed. Only two hundred and twenty-five remain before the miracle occurs. Come, we will use the remaining time to travel around the country and observe how this new musical experience is affecting people everywhere. This is Centavo City and we are in the suburbs on North Lincoln Street, that third house from the corner. We'll move in closer. That man seated behind the organ, John Foster. (*Mary Foster singing indistinctly*) Observe him well. Only an hour ago, he was still part of the tense, hard, fast-moving business world. Now, he is a million miles from there, lost in the music he plays. See how peaceful he looks, all the anxiety of the day gone. And there, the attractive woman standing by the organ and singing. That's the missus, the chief cook and bottle-washer. And that little girl intensely watching every move her father makes on the keyboard is the third member of the Foster family. There was a time when each night at this home was like being in a dark movie theater, sitting there like strangers watching the screen, each wrapped up in their own thoughts. Now, it is a close family sharing something together. (*Mary Foster singing indistinctly*)\nFoster family daughter: Daddy, can I play you the songs Mommy and I learned this afternoon?\n\nJohn Foster: Sure you can, dear. First, let me play you my favorite number. Remember this one, Mary? Your mother and I used to listen to this before you were born. (*Children speaking indistinctly*)\n\nNarrator: It is 4 p.m., and school is out. We are at 43 Market Street, home of Alice Winegrove. Mrs. Winegrove is on the phone.\n\nAlice Winegrove: And you should see it here, Jane. The whole neighborhood tribe is around the organ in the living room. You'd think my home was a children's social club! What did I do to deserve this? What's that? No, no, no, I guess I don't really mind. You know, it's kind of nice to have them spending some time in the house. Jane, listen. That's my Betty playing. I'll hold the receiver away from my ear so you can hear.\n\nNarrator: It's Saturday afternoon and the store seems very busy. But listen \u2014 must be coming from over there in that corner.\n\nMagnus demonstrator: It's actually that easy to play the Magnus electric chord organ. Now let me demonstrate again. No! Let me get, this time, you prove it to yourselves. Ah, little girl? You're the youngest. Let's start with you. Did you ever play an organ like this before?\n\nGirl: No.\n\nMagnus demonstrator: Would you like to?\n\nGirl: Yes, I think so.\n\nMagnus demonstrator: Alright, let's start. Now, for every number you see on this sheet, you press the key down that has the same corresponding number. Now, the first one is twelve \u2014 press that down. Now, twelve again. Now, thirteen, eleven-plus, twelve, thirteen, and so on. That's it! Now, just continue playing on like that. Don't you recognize that song?\n\nGirl: Uh, let's see. Oh, I know, of course! Well, that's \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\"; we sing it in school all the time!\n\nMagnus demonstrator: Wonderful! You did just fine. Now, young lady, it's time for you to take a little rest and let someone else try. How about you, sir?\n\nMan 2: Well, okay, I guess you got me a little curious. But I'll tell you right now, I'm no Toscanini. I never played an instrument or read a note in my life, and I'm not about to take lessons at this stage of my life.\nMagnus demonstrator: Alright, let's try. Now, press number ten and letter C, as you see it here on this music sheet. Now, number nine and eight. Now, continue by simply following the numbers on this sheet.\n\nMan 2: Gee! It feels kinda strange, like I'm listenin' to my own concert. I'm actually playin' Swanee River. *Laughs* I sound like a real musician. I always wondered how it felt to play. It's really quite a thrill. Well, thank you, thank you very much.\n\nMagnus demonstrator: You're next, madam. Let me show you how easy it is.\n\nWoman 1: Oh, well, I\u2014 I\u2014 I think I know, I\u2014 I was listening to you when you explained it to the other two people. Let's see. First, I press number one. Then, number six \u2014 oh! Oh, oh my, this organ has such a rich, beautiful sound. It sends vibrations through me. Ah, I never enjoyed a song so much in my life, I \u2014 oh my, I just can't believe it's really me playing. Oh, it's absolutely a miracle. Absolutely a miracle.\n\nWoman 2: May I be next to try?\n\nMagnus demonstrator: Sure you can. But first, I'd like to say a word to someone who's at home, listening to me on record. I know that right now you're sitting there in your living room by your phonograph, and probably wondering just how thrilling an experience it really is to sit down at the Magnus organ for the very first time and play music. Well, why not try it yourself? Everyone else here in the store is. As your local Magnus demonstrator, I can arrange it so you won't even have to come down to the store. I can bring a portable Magnus demonstrator right to your home. I'll try and telephone you sometime next week and we'll see if we can schedule you in for one of my many home calls. And, oh yes, when I do, be sure and remind me to tell you how you may be able to own a Magnus organ without any cost to you, through membership in our concert club. I'll be looking forward to talking to you. Alright, madam, now you're next. Now, if you'll just sit down here, we'll have you playing in minutes. Now, the first thing I want you to do is to press down on the\u2026\n\nNarrator: Listen. The seconds are ticking, and we are moving closer and closer to the six-hundred mark. That's it \u2014 six hundred seconds have just passed, and the miracle has occurred. For six hundred seconds, you have been listening to this story on record.\n\nMother: \u2026I comforted my child with a lullaby\u2026\n\nMinister: \u2026found in music the strength, the serenity of the greatest entity of all.\n\nMagnus meeting leader: What would you say if I told you that, with this new Magnus electric chord organ standing here, I can change\u2026\n\nNarrator: While you were listening to this story, the miracle was happening. Somewhere in the country at the precise time this record went on, someone sat down at a Magnus organ for the first time in their life \u2014 sat down without knowing anything about notes, chords or music, and now, after six hundred seconds \u2014 the time it took to play this record \u2014 this person is playing music on the king of all instruments, the electric organ. This is the six hundred-second miracle \u2014 the six hundred-second miracle that now awaits you. Well, you yourself are as close to this miracle as you are to the Magnus demonstrator who will soon be calling you.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/813994", "artist_names": "Jay and the Americans", "full_title": "Come Dance With Me by\u00a0Jay\u00a0and the Americans", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/aa83cf9a4988b3ceba09b632ea814ed1.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/aa83cf9a4988b3ceba09b632ea814ed1.999x999x1.jpg", "id": 813994, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429205273, "path": "/Jay-and-the-americans-come-dance-with-me-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Jay-and-the-americans-come-dance-with-me-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1964, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1964", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1964", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/aa83cf9a4988b3ceba09b632ea814ed1.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/aa83cf9a4988b3ceba09b632ea814ed1.999x999x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Come Dance With Me", "title_with_featured": "Come Dance With Me", "updated_by_human_at": 1557883754, "url": "https://genius.com/Jay-and-the-americans-come-dance-with-me-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/339102", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/4b8374965dfd39bc7061d9c38b96cbef.250x251x1.png", "id": 339102, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2274ee14a170a3efd91ad51b266bba4f.514x514x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Jay and the Americans", "slug": "Jay-and-the-americans", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Jay-and-the-americans"}, "artist": "Jay and the Americans", "lyrics": "Come Dance With Me LyricsDon't turn away;

City of New London LyricsCitation: 268 Conn. 1\n\nOpinion\n\nNORCOTT, J.\n\nThe principal issue in this appeal is whether the public use clauses of the federal and state constitutions authorize the exercise of the eminent domain power in furtherance of a significant economic development plan that is projected to create in excess of 1000 jobs, to increase tax and other revenues, and to revitalize an economically distressed city, including its downtown and waterfront areas. The plaintiffs,[2] owners of certain real property in the city of New London, appeal[3] from the judgment of the trial court denying their request for permanent injunctive relief to prevent the defendants, the city of New London (city), a municipal corporation, and the New London Development Corporation (development corporation), a private nonprofit economic development corporation, from exercising eminent domain authority to condemn the plaintiffs' properties located on parcel 3 of the development corporation's municipal development plan (development plan). The defendants cross appeal[4] from the judgment of the trial court granting the plaintiffs' request for permanent injunctive relief with respect to those properties located on parcel 4A of the development plan.\n\nOn appeal, the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) the taking of the plaintiffs' land was authorized under chapter 132 of the General Statutes; (2) economic development constitutes a valid public use under the takings clauses of the state and federal constitutions, and that these takings will sufficiently benefit the public and bear reasonable assurances of future public use; (3) the delegation of the eminent domain power to the development corporation was not unconstitutional; (4) the taking of the plaintiffs' land on parcel 3 was reasonably necessary to the development plan; and (5) the development corporation, by allowing a private social club, but not the plaintiffs' properties to remain on parcel 3, did not violate the plaintiffs' federal and state constitutional rights to equal protection of the laws. We affirm the judgment of the trial court with respect to the claims presented in the plaintiffs' appeal.\n\nOn their cross appeal, the defendants contend that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) the condemnation of the plaintiffs' properties on parcel 4A was not reasonably necessary to accomplish the development plan; and (2) the city's general power to widen and alter its roadways did not justify the taking of the plaintiffs' properties on parcel 4A. We reverse the judgment of the trial court with respect to the defendants' cross appeal.\nThe record reveals the following background facts and procedural history, as aptly set forth in the trial court's comprehensive memorandum of decision. \"In 1978, the [development corporation] was established to assist the city in planning economic development. In January, 1998, the state bond commission authorized bonds to support planning activities in the Fort Trumbull area [of the city] and property acquisition to be undertaken by [the development corporation] in support of the project and other money toward the ultimate creation of a state park at Fort Trumbull. In February, 1998, [Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer)] announced that it was developing a global research facility on the . . . New London Mills site which is adjacent to the Fort Trumbull area. In April, 1998, the New London city council gave initial approval to prepare a development plan for the Fort Trumbull area and the [development corporation] began holding informal neighborhood meetings regarding the [development plan] process. In May, 1998, the city council authorized [the development corporation] to proceed under chapters 130, 132 and/or 588 (l) of the [General] Statutes.\n\n\"The state bond commission approved more funds for [the development corporation] activity. In June, 1998, the city formally conveyed the New London Mills site to Pfizer. In July, 1998, a consulting team was appointed for the state Environmental Protection Act process and to prepare the [development plan]. Six alternative plans for the project area were considered as part of the required environmental impact evaluation.\"\n\nThe development plan area is approximately ninety acres in size and is located on the Thames River in New London, adjacent to the proposed Fort Trumbull State Park, and the Pfizer global research facility, which opened in June, 2001. See Appendix to this opinion. It presently includes residential and commercial areas, and is comprised of approximately 115 land parcels. The development plan area also includes the presently closed United States Naval Undersea Warfare Center, which is thirty-two acres, and also the regional water pollution control facility.\n\nIn its preface to the development plan, the development corporation stated that its goals were to create a development that would complement the facility that Pfizer was planning to build, create jobs, increase tax and other revenues, encourage public access to and use of the city's waterfront, and eventually \"build momentum\" for the revitalization of the rest of the city, including its downtown area.\n\nThe development plan itself is divided into seven parcels of land. Parcel 1 will include a waterfront hotel and conference center, along with marinas for both transient tourist boaters, and commercial fishing vessels. Parcel 1 also will include a public walkway along the waterfront. Parcel 2 will provide for approximately eighty new residences, organized into an urban neighborhood and linked by public walkway to the remainder of the development plan, including the Fort Trumbull State Park. Space will be reserved at the southern end of parcel 2 for the United States Coast Guard Museum (museum), which will be moved to the development plan area from the nearby United States Coast Guard Academy.\n\nParcel 3 is projected to have at least 90,000 square feet of high technology research and development office space and parking.[5] This office space would be located close to other research and development facilities, including those of Pfizer. The location of parcel 3 allows for direct vehicular access to the development therein, obviating the need for that traffic to pass through the rest of the development area. Parcel 3 also will retain the existing Italian Dramatic Club, a private social organization with its own building. Four properties owned by three of the plaintiffs are located on parcel 3.\n\nParcel 4 is subdivided into two smaller parcels, 4A and 4B. Parcel 4A is designated for \"park support\"; it will provide parking or retail services for the adjacent state park. Parcel 4B will include a marina, which will be a renovation of an existing marina and include slips for both recreational boating and commercial fishing operations. The walkway will be continued through these parcels. Eleven properties owned by four of the plaintiffs are located on parcel 4A.\n\nParcel 5 also is subdivided into three separate parcels, which cumulatively will include 140,000 square feet of office space, parking and retail space. Parcel 6 will be developed for a variety of water-dependent commercial uses. Parcel 7 is small and will be used for additional office or research and development use.\n\nAccording to Admiral David Goebel, chief operating officer of the development corporation, the development corporation will own the land located within the development area. The development corporation will enter into ground leases of various parcels to private developers; those leases will require the developer to comply with the terms of the development plan. At the time of trial, the development corporation was negotiating with Corcoran Jennison, a developer, with the intention of entering into a ninety-nine year ground lease of parcels 1, 2 and 3 with the developer. Under the lease, Corcoran Jennison will pay the development corporation rent of $1 per year. Corcoran Jennison will actually develop the parcels, a process that includes marketing for and locating tenants.\n\nThe development corporation estimated that the development plan, which is a composite of the most beneficial features of six alternate development plans that it had considered,[6] would have a significant socio-economic impact on the New London region. The development plan is expected to generate approximately between: (1) 518 and 867 construction jobs; (2) 718 and 1362 direct jobs; and (3) 500 and 940 indirect jobs. The composite parcels of the development plan also are expected to generate between $680,544 and $1,249,843 in property tax revenues for the city, in which 54 percent of the land area is exempt from property taxes. These gains would occur in a city that, with the exception of the new Pfizer facility adjacent to the development plan area that now employs approximately 2000 people, recently has experienced serious employment declines, particularly with the loss of approximately 1900 government sector positions, and the closure of the United States Naval Undersea Warfare Center in 1996, which transferred more than 1000 positions to Newport, Rhode Island.[7] Indeed, the state office of policy and management has designated the city a \"`distressed municipality.'\"\n\nThe development corporation board approved the development plan in early 2000; the city council also approved it shortly thereafter.[8] When it approved the development plan in January, 2000, the city council also had authorized the development corporation to acquire properties within the development area. Thereafter, in October, 2000, the development corporation voted to use the power of eminent domain to acquire properties within the development area whose owners had not been willing to sell them. In November, 2000, the development corporation filed the condemnation proceedings that gave rise to the actions presently on appeal. Thereafter, in December, 2000, the plaintiffs brought the present action challenging the condemnations.\n\nThe trial court noted in its memorandum of decision that \"[e]ach of the plaintiffs testified and said they wished to remain in their homes for a variety of personal reasons. Two of the people referred to the fact that their families have lived in their homes for decades. They all testified that they loved their homes and the Fort Trumbull area. Several have put a lot of work into their property and all of them appeared . . . to be sincerely attached to their homes. One owner, [Susette] Kelo, loved the view her house afforded her and the fact that it was close to the water. All testified that they were not opposed to new development in the Fort Trumbull area. Also, two of the plaintiffs own their property as business investments\u2014the rental of apartments. These two people have put much time, money and effort into renovating their properties, one has owned his property for seventeen years, the other for about eight years.\"\n\nAfter a seven day bench trial, the court granted permanent injunctive relief to, and dismissed the pending eminent domain actions against, the four plaintiffs who live on parcel 4A of the development plan. The court, however, upheld the takings of the parcel 3 properties.[9] This appeal and cross appeal followed. Additional facts and procedural history will be set forth in greater detail as necessary for the resolution of this appeal.I\nWHETHER CHAPTER 132 OF THE GENERAL STATUTES APPLIES TO NONVACANT LANDSAND, THEREFORE, AUTHORIZED THE TAKING OF THE PLAINTIFFS' LANDThe plaintiffs' first claim is that the trial court improperly determined that the development corporation has the authority to condemn the plaintiffs' property under chapter 132 of the General Statutes.[10] The plaintiffs contend that chapter 132; General Statutes \u00a7 8-186 et seq.; applies only to \"unified land and water areas\" and \"vacated commercial plants,\" and that their homes fit neither of those categories, because under the language and legislative history of chapter 132, the statutory term \"unified land and water areas\" refers only to undeveloped land. The defendants claim, in response, that, in the context of the statutory language of the entire chapter, the term \"unified land and water areas\" includes developed land, and moreover, to conclude otherwise would frustrate the declared legislative purpose of restoring the state's economic health. We agree with the defendants.\n\nWe begin our analysis by reviewing the conclusions of the trial court on this issue. The trial court noted that it was undisputed that the development corporation attempted to exercise its eminent domain powers pursuant to only chapter 132 of the General Statutes, and stated that it would construe the eminent domain statutes strictly against the condemning authority. The trial court rejected the plaintiffs' arguments that chapter 132 applies only to: (1) multimunicipality districts; and (2) undeveloped land other than vacated commercial plants. The court conducted a thorough analysis of the chapter's language and legislative history, and concluded that references throughout the chapter to \"structures\" and \"demolition,\" as well as the requirement in General Statutes \u00a7 8-189 (f) that a plan exist for relocating project area occupants, indicated that the chapter applies to developed land as well as vacant land. In so concluding, the court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the subsequent addition of \"vacated commercial plants\" to the chapter was necessary because, otherwise, the statute would apply only to vacant land.[11]\n\nWe first set forth the applicable standard of review, and the process by which we interpret statutes. \"Statutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Grondin v. Curi, 262 Conn. 637, 649, 817 A.2d 61 (2003). \"[T]he process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. . . . In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\"[12] (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Commissioner of Social Services v. Smith, 265 Conn. 723, 734, 830 A.2d 228 (2003).\n\nWe begin our analysis of this claim by reviewing the language of the relevant sections of chapter 132 of the General Statutes. The chapter begins with General Statutes \u00a7 8-186,[13] which is the legislative declaration of policy recognizing that the state's \"economic welfare\" is dependent on the \"growth of industry and business . . . .\" Section 8-186 provides, inter alia, that \"permitting and assisting municipalities to acquire and improve unified land and water areas and to acquire and improve or demolish vacated commercial plants for industrial and business purposes . . . are public uses and purposes for which public moneys may be expended; and that the necessity in the public interest for the provisions of this chapter is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.\"[14] (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 8-187[15] is the chapter's definitions section, providing most significantly that \"`real property' means land, subterranean or subsurface rights, structures, any and all easements, air rights and franchises and every estate, right or interest therein . . . .\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 8-187 (9). General Statutes \u00a7 8-189[16] describes the requirements that the development agency must follow in preparing the mandatory project plan, which include providing \"a plan for relocating project-area occupants . . . .\" General Statutes \u00a7 8-189 (f). General Statutes \u00a7 8-193[17] permits the development agency to acquire real property within the project area, including through the exercise of the eminent domain power as authorized by the city council. General Statutes \u00a7 8-198[18] provides for the promulgation of regulations to carry out the provisions of chapter 132. Finally, General Statutes \u00a7 8-199[19] provides that all actions taken by the development agency are taken in the name of the municipality.\n\nThe statutory term whose meaning is in dispute is \"unified land and water areas\"; General Statutes \u00a7 8-186; a phrase that is not defined expressly in any section of chapter 132 of the General Statutes. Thus, in construing the term, we look to its commonly approved usage, an inquiry that often is enhanced by the examination of dictionary definitions. See, e.g., Hasselt v. Lufthansa German Airlines, 262 Conn. 416, 425, 815 A.2d 94 (2003) (utilizing Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary definition to construe statutory term \"including\"); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a). Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines \"unified\" as the adjective form of \"unify,\" which means \"make into a coherent group or whole . . . .\" Accordingly, we conclude that, as used in \u00a7 8-186 of chapter 132, a \"unified land and water [area]\" is one that exists because of the combination of separate land parcels into a unitary development scheme,[20] a definition that undisputedly fits the Fort Trumbull development plan in the present case. This definition, however, does not resolve the issue of whether a unified land and water area under chapter 132 is limited to vacant land. Accordingly, we must continue our analysis by examining the term in the context of both the language of the chapter as a whole, and the legislative history.\n\nWe conclude that the term \"unified land and water areas\" in \u00a7 8-186 is not limited to vacant land. The language and legislative history of chapter 132 of the General Statutes in its entirety are replete with references that compel this conclusion. For example, \u00a7 8-187 (9), the chapter's definition of \"`real property,'\" includes \"structures\" expressly within its ambit. See footnote 15 of this opinion. Moreover, the legislative history indicates that \u00a7 8-187 (9) was enacted as Public Acts 1980, No. 80-18, to clarify the meanings of the terms \"land\" and \"real property\" as used in chapter 132, and to make them consistent with the definitions provided in chapter 130 of the General Statutes, the urban renewal statutes.[21] See 23 H.R. Proc., Pt. 2, 1980 Sess., p. 453, remarks of Representative Joseph J. Farricielli (\"This bill would attempt to remove confusing language defining land and the real property in Chapter 132 as compared to Chapter 130 of the General Statutes. It would clarify the meaning of real property as applied to state assisted municipal industrial development rights.\"); see also 23 S. Proc., Pt. 3, 1980 Sess., pp. 660-61, remarks of Senator Sanford Cloud, Jr. (same). Even more significantly, \u00a7 8-193 (a), which provides authorization for the acquisition of real property by eminent domain; see footnote 17 of this opinion; does not include or exclude any specific type of real property, leaving us only to conclude that the power applies to \"`real property,'\" as broadly defined in \u00a7 8-187 (9).\n\nAnother probative definition is that of \"`development project,'\" which is defined as \"a project conducted by a municipality for the assembly, improvement and disposition of land or buildings or both to be used principally for industrial or business purposes and includes vacated commercial plants . . . .\" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 8-187 (4). This definition is significant because the use of the word \"includes\" in the phrase \"includes vacated commercial plants\" indicates firmly that vacated commercial plants are not the only structures contemplated by the legislature as potentially present in a development area. See Hasselt v. Lufthansa German Airlines, supra, 262 Conn. 424-25 (Court construed General Statutes \u00a7 31-307a [c], which \"imposes liability on the [second injury] fund to reimburse employers for adjustments, including lump-sum payments . . . . Construing the word including according to its ordinary usage, however, must mean that the fund is required as well to reimburse employers for something other than those retroactive [cost of living adjustments] paid in a lump sum.\" [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).\n\nMoreover, \u00a7 8-189, which describes the requirements that the development agency must follow in preparing the required project plan, requires the agency to provide \"a plan for relocating project-area occupants . . . .\" General Statutes \u00a7 8-189 (f); see footnote 16 of this opinion. This is a requirement that, by definition, contradicts the plaintiffs' argument that \"unified land and water areas\" is limited to vacant land; it is axiomatic that vacant land has no occupants to relocate.\n\nFurthermore, the commissioner's regulations, promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 8-198, support the conclusion that \"unified land and water areas\" under chapter 132 of the General Statutes include occupied, and indeed, residential, land. Section 8-198-10 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies,[22] the regulation providing for the determination of funding for development grants, provides that \"[t]he amount of funds available to a municipality for development grants is based on a percentage of the net project cost. The net project cost is the total project cost less the estimated income from the project.\" Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 8-198-10 (a). We note that one factor that may be calculated into project cost is relocation expenses; Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 8-198-10 (a) (7); and that another factor that may be calculated into project income is income gained from \"the temporary use of land, residences or businesses prior to their dispositions . . . .\" Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 8-198-10 (b) (2). These regulations are particularly probative in light of the well established proposition that \"unless [administrative regulations] are shown to be inconsistent with the authorizing statute, they have the force and effect of a statute.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)  Andersen Consulting,LLP v. Gavin, 255 Conn. 498, 520 n.15, 767 A.2d 692 (2001). We particularly are persuaded by the fact that the commissioner responsible for the implementation of chapter 132 has implemented regulations pursuant to that chapter that consider expressly residences, and their relocation, as factors for calculating the funding of development grants. Cf.  MacDermid, Inc. v. Dept. of Environmental Protection , 257 Conn. 128, 138, 778 A.2d 7 (2001) (\"it is the well established practice of this court to accord great deference to the construction given [a] statute by the agency charged with its enforcement\" [internal quotation marks omitted]).\n\nThe plaintiffs claim that the text and legislative history of chapter 132 of the General Statutes indicate that unified land and water areas do not include land already developed with business and residences. Specifically, they contend that a construction of \"unified land and water areas\" that includes developed or occupied land renders the subsequent addition of \"vacated commercial plants\" superfluous. They also contend that the legislative genealogy and history indicates that the legislature did not intend the term \"unified land and water areas\" to include occupied land because references within the chapter pertinent to occupied land, such as those of demolition and rehabilitation, were added only after the vacated commercial plant provision was enacted in 1972. Finally, the plaintiffs contend that construing \"unified land and water areas\" to include occupied land would be excessively broad in light of the strict construction given to eminent domain statutes. We disagree with these contentions, and address each in turn.\n\nWe first conclude that construing \"unified land and water areas\" as including occupied land does not render the \"vacated commercial plants\" provision of \u00a7 8-186 superfluous. Indeed, the legislative history indicates that, in enacting chapter 132 of the General Statutes, the legislature envisioned two different types of economic development plans, one aimed at developing unified land areas, or combinations of multiple parcels of land, and the other intended to revitalize underutilized commercial buildings. In introducing the bill that was enacted as Public Acts 1972, No. 87, which added the \"vacant commercial plant\" language to chapter 132, Senator Lawrence J. DeNardis stated that \"this Bill will allow municipalities through their development agencies, to acquire [improve] and rehabilitate vacant commercial plants. At present, municipalities can acquire and improve unified land areas as it is worded in the present Statutes. They also have the power to clear, repair, operate and insure real property. This Bill would add the additional power of rehabilitation to the list and furthermore, it would add vacated commercial plants to the areas that can be dealt with or the matters that could be dealt with. . . . [T]he intent of this Bill is to improve the economic climate of the State by furthering industry and thereby creating jobs.\" (Emphasis added.) 15 S. Proc., Pt. 2, 1972 Sess., p. 785.[23] Put differently, chapter 132 does not require that a vacated commercial plant be located within a unified land and water area; they merely present two different opportunities for economic development. Accordingly, we conclude that a construction of the term \"unified land and water areas\" in \u00a7 8-186 that includes developed or occupied land does not render the 1972 addition of \"vacated commercial plants\" superfluous.\n\nWe also reject the plaintiffs' contention that the legislative genealogy of \u00a7 8-186 indicates that the legislature did not intend \"unified land and water areas\" to include occupied land because references within chapter 132 of the General Statutes pertinent to occupied land, such as those to demolition and rehabilitation, were added only after the vacated commercial plant provision was enacted in 1972. Our reading of the legislative history, and particularly the original 1967 Public Act, contradicts the plaintiffs' construction of the chapter. The plaintiffs note correctly that \"rehabilitate\" was not added to the development agency's powers under \u00a7 8-193 (b) until 1972; see Public Acts 1972, No. 87, \u00a7 3; and that the power to \"demolish\" vacated commercial plants was not added until 1974; see Public Acts 1974, No. 74-184, \u00a7 6 (b);[24] both of which occurred after vacated commercial plants were added to the scope of the chapter. Our reading, however, of the original 1967 Public Act, which only provided for the development of unified land and water areas, reveals that the legislature contemplated unified land and water areas as including occupied land. Indeed, \u00a7 8-189 (f), which requires the development agency to submit \"a plan for relocating project-area occupants,\" was included in the 1967 act.[25] See Public Acts 1967, No. 760, \u00a7 4 (f). Accordingly, we disagree with the plaintiffs' contention that the legislative history of \u00a7 8-186 necessarily indicates that the legislature intended \"unified land and water areas\" to be limited to vacant land.\n\nWe next address the plaintiffs' contention that construing \"unified land and water areas\" to include occupied land would be excessively broad in light of the strict construction applied to eminent domain statutes. We are mindful of the well established proposition that \"[t]he authority to condemn [is to] be strictly construed in favor of the owner of the property taken and against the condemnor . . . .\"  State v. McCook , 109 Conn. 621, 630, 147 A. 126 (1929). We also note, however, that \"[t]he statute . . . should be enforced in such a way as to effectuate the purpose for which it was enacted.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)  Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport , 259 Conn. 592, 601-602, 790 A.2d 1178 (2002). We conclude that construing the ambiguous term \"unified land and water areas\" in \u00a7 8-186 as including occupied land is not impermissibly broad; indeed, the language of other provisions in chapter 132 of the General Statutes compels this conclusion, and our review of the legislative history reveals nothing to contradict it. Moreover, a construction limiting the application of the unified land and water areas provisions of chapter 132 to vacant land would undercut severely the chapter's declared purpose of promoting economic development, particularly as the state's stock of vacant land diminishes. This construction largely would limit the applicability of chapter 132 in urban and suburban areas to vacated commercial plants standing alone; the presence of a structure in the project area that does not meet the definition of vacated commercial plant would disrupt the entire economic development plan because it would need to be built around. This would make the parcels unattractive for investment by developers, and would, therefore, thwart the declared purpose of chapter 132. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-186. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly construed the term \"unified land and water areas\" in \u00a7 8-186 of chapter 132 as not excluding developed or occupied land.II\nWHETHER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS A PUBLIC USE UNDER THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONSWe next address the principal issue in this appeal, which is the plaintiffs' claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the use of eminent domain for economic development does not violate the public use clauses of the state and federal constitutions. Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that: (1) economic development as contemplated in chapter 132 of the General Statutes is not a public use under the state and federal constitutions; (2) even if economic development is a public use, the condemnations in the present case do not promote sufficient public benefit to pass constitutional muster; and (3) the condemnation of parcels 3 and 4A lack a reasonable assurance of future public use because private parties retain control over the parcels' use. We address each contention in turn.AWhether Economic Development Is a Public Use under the State and Federal ConstitutionsThe plaintiffs' first contention is that the trial court improperly concluded that economic development under chapter 132 of the General Statutes, namely, the development plan in the present case, is a public purpose that satisfies the public use clauses of article first, \u00a7 11, of the Connecticut constitution,[26] and the fifth amendment to the United States constitution.[27] Specifically, they claim that the condemnation of property for economic development by private parties is inconsistent with this court's prior public use decisions because: (1) the new owner will not provide a public service or utility; and (2) the condemnation will not remove blight conditions that are, in and of themselves, harmful to the public. In response, the defendants contend that by concluding that economic development is by itself a public use justifying the exercise of the eminent domain power, the trial court properly deferred to state and municipal legislative determinations. We conclude that economic development projects created and implemented pursuant to chapter 132 that have the public economic benefits of creating new jobs, increasing tax and other revenues, and contributing to urban revitalization, satisfy the public use clauses of the state and federal constitutions.[28]\n\nWe begin by setting forth the applicable statutory framework. The legislative determination at issue in the present case is provided by \u00a7 8-186, which provides that as a matter of legislative finding and declaration,\"that the economic welfare of the state depends upon the continued growth of industry and business within the state; that the acquisition and improvement of unified land and water areas and vacated commercial plants to meet the needs of industry and business should be in accordance with local, regional and state planning objectives; that such acquisition and improvement often cannot be accomplished through the ordinary operations of private enterprise at competitive rates of progress and economies of cost; that permitting and assisting municipalities to acquire and improve unified land and water areas and to acquire and improve or demolish vacated commercial plants for industrial and business purposes . . . are public uses and purposes for which public moneys may be expended; and that the necessity in the public interest for the provisions of this chapter is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.\"(Emphasis added.)\n\nThe trial court concluded that this language did not violate the public use clauses of either the state or the federal constitutions. In so concluding, the trial court relied on decisions from this court and the United States Supreme Court, but especially  Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff , 467 U.S. 229, 239-40, 104 S. Ct. 2321, 81 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1984),  Berman v. Parker , 348 U.S. 26, 31-32, 75 S. Ct. 98, 99 L. Ed. 27 (1954),  Katz v. Brandon , 156 Conn. 521, 532-34, 245 A.2d 579 (1968),  Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford , 141 Conn. 135, 141-43, 104 A.2d 365 (1954), and  Olmstead v. Camp , 33 Conn. 532, 546 (1866). After reviewing the authorities, the trial court concluded that both this court and the United States Supreme Court consistently have taken a broad, purposive view of the concept of public use, and accordingly have taken a deferential approach to legislative pronouncements of public use. The trial court, however, also emphasized that the public use question is ultimately a judicial inquiry. Ultimately, the trial court concluded that the purpose of chapter 132 of the General Statutes, as expressed in \u00a7 8-186; see footnote 13 of this opinion; was an appropriate public use that passed muster under both state and federal constitutions, stating that \"[e]conomic growth and its encouragement, especially in `distressed municipalities' is a valid public use because it obviously confers a benefit to all members of the public.\" Accordingly, the trial court concluded that \"the language of chapter 132 authorizing the use of eminent domain power for the purpose of accomplishing economic development in designative project areas [is not] violative of the federal or state eminent domain clauses of their respective constitutions.\"\n\nWe note that the trial court approached the plaintiffs' general claim about whether economic development is a constitutional public use in the context of a facial attack on the provisions of chapter 132 of the General Statutes that authorize the use of eminent domain. Although the plaintiffs do not argue expressly that these statutory provisions are unconstitutional, we will address this particular claim as a facial attack on the constitutionality of chapter 132 inasmuch as it authorizes the use of eminent domain for private economic development. Accordingly, \"we proceed from the well recognized jurisprudential principle that [t]he party attacking a validly enacted statute . . . bears the heavy burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt and we indulge in every presumption in favor of the statute's constitutionality. . . . The burden of proving unconstitutionality is especially heavy when, as at this juncture, a statute is challenged as being unconstitutional on its face.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)  State v. Ball , 260 Conn. 275, 280-81, 796 A.2d 542 (2002).\n\nMoreover, in light of the somewhat confusing constitutional posture of their principal and reply briefs,[29] we also take the opportunity to clarify the scope of our review of the plaintiffs' constitutional claims in the present case. Inasmuch as the relevant public use language of the state and federal constitutions is virtually identical; see footnotes 26 and 27 of this opinion; the plaintiffs have not stated expressly that the Connecticut constitution offers them greater protection, and their claim presents an issue of first impression for this court, we will address simultaneously their federal and state claims. See  Donahue v. Southington , 259 Conn. 783, 794 n.7, 792 A.2d 76 (2002) (\"If a party does not provide an independent analysis asserting the existence of greater protection under the state constitutional provision than its federal counterpart . . . we will not of our own initiative address that question. . . . Accordingly, the federal equal protection standard is considered prevailing for the purposes of our review of both the state and federal equal protection claims in this case.\" [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).\n\nWe now turn to the substance of the plaintiffs' claims. This court long has taken a flexible approach to construction of the Connecticut public use clause. Indeed, our analysis begins in 1866, when this court, in  Olmstead v. Camp, supra , 33 Conn. 532, first addressed the constitutional concept of public use. In Olmstead, the owner of a water powered mill used for the grinding of grain petitioned the court, pursuant to the flowage act, for permission to make improvements to the pond and dam that powered his mill. Id. These alterations necessarily would have resulted in flooding his neighbor's land, and the neighbor had refused to accept compensation from the mill owner for the privilege of flooding his land.[30] Id., 532-33.\n\nThis court concluded that the mill owner should be permitted to flood his neighbor's land. Id., 552. In interpreting Connecticut's public use clause, the court rejected a strict construction that \"the term `public use' means possession, occupation, direct enjoyment, by the public.\" Id., 546. Instead, it concluded that \"such a limitation of the intent of this important clause would be entirely different from its accepted interpretation, and would prove as unfortunate as novel. One of the most common meanings of the word `use' as defined by [Webster's Dictionary], is `usefulness, utility, advantage, productive of benefit.' `Public use' may therefore well mean public usefulness, utility or advantage, or what is productive of general benefit; so that any appropriating of private property by the state under its right of eminent domain for purposes of great advantage to the community, is a taking for public use. Such, it is believed, is the construction which has uniformly been put upon the language by courts, legislatures and legal authorities.\"[31] (Emphasis added.) Id.\n\nMoreover, the court in Olmstead laid the foundation for our deferential approach to legislative declarations of public use, stating that \"[t]he question is asked with great pertinence and propriety, what then is the limit of the legislative power under the clause which we have been considering, and what is the exact line between public and private uses? Our reply is that which has heretofore been quoted. From the nature of the case there can be no precise line. The power requires a degree of elasticity to be capable of meeting new conditions and improvements and the ever increasing necessities of society. The sole dependence must be on the presumed wisdom of the sovereign authority, supervised, and in cases of gross error or extreme wrong, controlled, by the dispassionate judgment of the courts.\" (Emphasis added.) Id., 551; accord  New York, N.H. & H. R. Co. v. Offield , 77 Conn. 417, 421, 59 A. 510 (1904) (in taking for railroad improvements, court held \"[t]hat the uses to be furthered are public, is a question the decision of which by the legislative department, while not absolutely conclusive upon the judicial department . . . is entitled to very great weight\").\n\nThis court has continued to afford the public use clause a broad construction, and repeatedly has embraced the purposive formulation first articulated in  Olmstead v. Camp, supra , 33 Conn. 546.[32] In  Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra , 141 Conn. 139, the owner of commercial real estate challenged the constitutionality of the eminent domain provisions of the redevelopment act, under which land in blighted urban areas could be taken, cleared and sold or leased to redevelopers. The property owner contended that use of eminent domain in this manner violated the public use clause of the state constitution. Id., 141. Utilizing the purposive definition of public use from  Olmstead v. Camp, supra , 33 Conn. 546, this court relied on express legislative findings about the deleterious effects of urban blight, and concluded that \"there can be no doubt that the elimination of such substandard, insanitary, deteriorated, slum or blighted areas . . . is for the public welfare. Private property taken for the purpose of eradicating the conditions which obtain in such areas is taken for a public use.\"  Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra , 143. Moreover, with respect to the provisions of the act allowing the taken land to be sold or leased to private developers, the court concluded that \"[i]f the public use which justifies the exercise of eminent domain in the first instance is the use of the property for purposes other than slums, that same public use continues after the property is transferred to private persons. The public purposes for which the land was taken are still being accomplished.\" (Emphasis added.) Id., 143-44.\n\nGohld Realty Co. was followed by  Katz v. Brandon, supra , 156 Conn. 521.[33] In Katz, a property owner brought an action to determine the validity of the taking of his home pursuant to a redevelopment plan in Hartford. Id., 523. A manufacturing corporation had a plant with an employee parking lot near the plaintiff's home. Id., 525. The state had condemned this parking lot for the construction of an interstate highway. Id. The corporation had offered to build a parking garage in the area, should the city approve a redevelopment plan in the area. Id., 525-26. Subsequently, the redevelopment agency approved a redevelopment plan in the area, which included the plaintiff's land. Id., 525. The city then met with the corporation and other local manufacturers to discuss the redevelopment area, which was found by the city and the agency to be blighted and unsafe. Id., 526-27. The city did not enter into an agreement with the corporation to purchase or lease any of the land; the city was of the opinion that the project was necessary with or without the corporation's participation. Id., 527-28. Subsequently, the city approved the redevelopment project and acquired title to all properties in the area by purchase or eminent domain, including those of the plaintiff. Id., 529-31. The plaintiff brought an action, and contended that the takings were invalid because they were taken for the private purpose of inducing the corporation to remain in Hartford by providing a parking lot for its employees, rather than for a public purpose. Id., 531.\n\nThis court, relying on  Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra , 141 Conn. 143, rejected the plaintiff's argument, and emphasized that the public use was the clearing of the blighted land.  Katz v. Brandon, supra , 156 Conn. 534. Indeed, the court in Katz further broadened our approach to public use, citing  Barnes v. New Haven , 140 Conn. 8, 15-16, 98 A.2d 523 (1953), a public spending case. See footnote 32 of this opinion. Indeed, this court stated in Katz that\"[a] public use defies absolute definition, for it changes with varying conditions of society, new appliances in the sciences, changing conceptions of the scope and functions of government, and other differing circumstances brought about by an increase in population and new modes of communication and transportation. . . .Courts as a rule, instead of attempting judicially to define a public as distinguished from a private purpose, have left each case to be determined on its own peculiar circumstances. Promotion of the public safety and general welfare constitutes a recognized public purpose. . . . The modern trend of authority is to expand and liberally construe the meaning of public purpose. The test of public use is not how the use is furnished but rather the right of the public to receive and enjoy its benefit.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)  Katz v. Brandon, supra , 532-33;[34]Barnes v. New Haven, supra , 15. Accordingly, the court in Katz rejected the plaintiff's argument that the redevelopment plan violated the public use requirement.  Katz v. Brandon, supra, 534.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has afforded similarly broad treatment to the federal public use clause. In  Berman v. Parker, supra , 348 U.S. 28-29, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of the District of Columbia's redevelopment act, in which Congress had declared, as a matter of public policy, the acquisition of property necessary to eliminate blight conditions. The act allowed the redevelopment agency, once it acquired the property, to transfer it to redevelopment companies or individuals to carry out the plan; indeed, private enterprise was preferred over public agencies for execution of the plan. Id., 30. The owner of a department store in the rehabilitation area challenged the taking of his property pursuant to the plan, and contended that it was unconstitutional because: (1) his property was not slum housing; and (2) it would be redeveloped and managed by private, and not public agencies, for private, and not public use. Id., 31.\n\nThe Supreme Court concluded that the redevelopment act was a valid exercise of the police power that Congress exercises over the District of Columbia. Id., 34. The court adopted the broad, purposive view of eminent domain, and held that the police power, while generally undefinable, \"is essentially the product of legislative determinations addressed to the purposes of government, purposes neither abstractly nor historically capable of complete definition. Subject to specific constitutional limitations, when the legislature has spoken, the public interest has been declared in terms well-nigh conclusive. In such cases the legislature, not the judiciary, is the main guardian of the public needs to be served by social legislation, whether it be Congress legislating concerning the District of Columbia . . . or the States legislating concerning local affairs. . . . This principle admits of no exception merely because the power of eminent domain is involved. The role of the judiciary in determining whether that power is being exercised for a public purpose is an extremely narrow one.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 32.\n\nMoreover, the court stated that \"[o]nce the object is within the authority of Congress, the right to realize it through the exercise of eminent domain is clear. For the power of eminent domain is merely the means to the end.\" Id., 33. Accordingly, the court concluded that, because the taking was for the public purpose of clearing blighted areas, the means of redevelopment through private enterprise did not violate the public use clause.[35] Id. Indeed, the court also adopted a highly deferential approach to agency determination of necessity, allowing the agency to take the building despite the fact that it was, itself, not blighted. Id., 33-34. \"If the [a]gency considers it necessary in carrying out the redevelopment project to take full title to the real property involved, it may do so. It is not for the courts to determine whether it is necessary for successful consummation of the project that unsafe, unsightly, or insanitary buildings alone be taken or whether title to the land be included, any more than it is the function of the courts to sort and choose among the various parcels selected for condemnation.\" Id., 36. Ultimately, the court concluded that \"[t]he rights of these property owners are satisfied when they receive that just compensation which the Fifth Amendment exacts as the price of the taking.\" Id.\n\nThe broad purposive approach to the interpretation of the federal public use clause reached its zenith in 1984, with the Supreme Court's decision in  Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra , 467 U.S. 239-40. In that case, the Hawaii state legislature had attempted to address economic problems created by severely overconcentrated land ownership that remained as a vestige of the feudal land tenure scheme developed by the original Polynesian settlers. Id., 232-33. \"The legislature concluded that concentrated land ownership was responsible for skewing the State's residential fee simple market, inflating land prices, and injuring the public tranquility and welfare.\" Id., 232.\n\nIn response to this property crisis, the Hawaii legislature had enacted legislation that created a mechanism for the condemnation of residential land tracts by the Hawaii housing authority, with subsequent transfer of the condemned fees simple to existing lessees. Id., 233. The act provided for a hearing process to ensure that the condemnation would further the public purpose of the act. Id. Once the housing authority acquired the land and paid compensation to the landowners, it was authorized to sell the land to the tenant residing there,[36] or to sell or lease it to other prospective purchasers. Id., 234. The act prohibited the sale or lease of more than one lot to the same person. Id. Landowners, whose land had been condemned pursuant to the act after a hearing, brought an action to have the law declared unconstitutional. Id., 235.\n\nThe Supreme Court concluded, with \"no trouble,\" that the act was a constitutional exercise of the Hawaii legislature's police powers because \"[r]egulating oligopoly and the evils associated with it is a classic exercise of a State's police powers.\" Id., 241-42. The court relied on  Berman v. Parker, supra , 348 U.S. 31-33, and concluded that \"[t]he `public use' requirement is thus coterminous with the scope of a sovereign's police powers.\"  Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra , 467 U.S. 240. Accordingly, the court stated that \"where the exercise of the eminent domain power is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose, [this] Court has never held a compensated taking to be proscribed by the Public Use Clause.\" Id., 241. As applied, the court concluded that the act was a \"comprehensive and rational approach to identifying and correcting market failure.\"[37] Id., 242.\n\nMoreover, in Midkiff, the Supreme Court reemphasized the Berman theme of judicial deference to the legislative public use determination, stating that the courts' role \"in reviewing a legislature's judgment of what constitutes a public use, even when the eminent domain power is equated with the police power . . . is . . . extremely narrow . . . .\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 240. \"In short, the Court has made clear that it will not substitute its judgment for a legislature's judgment as to what constitutes a public use unless the use be palpably without reasonable foundation.\"[38] (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 241. The court emphasized that this deference applies equally to determinations made by both Congress and the state legislatures, and that \"[j]udicial deference is required because, in our system of government, legislatures are better able to assess what public purposes should be advanced by an exercise of the taking power. . . . Thus, if a legislature, state or federal, determines there are substantial reasons for an exercise of the taking power, courts must defer to its determination that the taking will serve a public use.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 244.\n\nOur analysis of the foregoing cases reveals that this state's well established approach to judicial review of legislative public use determinations, first articulated more than 125 years ago in Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 546-51, is in harmony with the approach of the federal courts, as enunciated in Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra, 467 U.S. 239-40, and Berman v. Parker, supra, 348 U.S. 31-32. Both federal and state courts place an overwhelming emphasis on the legislative purpose and motive behind the taking, and give substantial deference to the legislative determination of purpose. Accordingly, with this standard in mind, we turn to the plaintiffs' specific claim, which is that economic development is not, by itself, a public use under either the United States or Connecticut constitutions.\n\nUnder this broad and deferential constitutional rubric, we conclude that an economic development plan that the appropriate legislative authority rationally has determined will promote significant municipal economic development, constitutes a valid public use for the exercise of the eminent domain power under both the federal and Connecticut constitutions. Indeed, the courts of several of our sister states, using the same deferential and purposive approach to which we adhere, have arrived at the same conclusion. See Oakland v. Oakland Raiders, 32 Cal. 3d 60, 69-72, 646 P.2d 835, 183 Cal. Rptr. 673 (1982) (concluding that city was not barred as matter of law from taking professional football franchise by eminent domain in order to keep it from moving to another city; remanding for complete determination of public benefit involved); Shreveport v. Chanse Gas Corp., 794 So. 2d 962, 973 (La. App. 2001) (relying on Berman, Midkiff, and relevant legislative declarations to conclude that \"economic development, in the form of a convention center and headquarters hotel, satisfies the public purposes and public necessity requirement of [state constitution]\"), cert. denied, 805 So. 2d 209 (La. 2002); Prince George's County v. Collington Crossroads, Inc., 275 Md. 171, 191, 339 A.2d 278 (1975) (concluding in condemnation for industrial park that \"projects reasonably designed to benefit the general public, by significantly enhancing the economic growth of the State or its subdivisions, are public uses [under state constitution], at least where the exercise of the power of condemnation provides an impetus which private enterprise cannot provide\"); Poletown Neighborhood Council v. Detroit, 410 Mich. 616, 633-35, 304 N.W.2d 455 (1981) (A landmark case relying on legislative and redevelopment agency declarations and upholding, under the state constitution, the taking of private homes for the construction of a major car manufacturing assembly plant. \"The power of eminent domain is to be used in this instance primarily to accomplish the essential public purposes of alleviating unemployment and revitalizing the economic base of the community. The benefit to a private interest is merely incidental.\");[39] Duluth v. State, 390 N.W.2d 757, 761-64 council legislative determination to conclude that construction of large privately operated paper mill that would alleviate unemployment and contribute to city's economic revitalization was public purpose justifying use of eminent domain under federal and state public use clauses); Kansas City v. Hon, 972 S.W.2d 407, 414 (Mo. App. 1998) (airport expansion is public use that will be furthered by subsequent transfer of land to private aviation related corporation); Vitucci v. New York City School Construction Authority, 289 App. Div. 2d 479, 481, 735 N.Y.S.2d 560 (2001) (condemnee not entitled to right of first refusal when condemnor sold land to private party for \"new public purpose; the expansion of the facilities of a major employer and economic force in the area\"; \"[i]f a municipality determines that a new business may create jobs, provide infrastructure, and stimulate the local economy, those are legitimate public purposes which justify the use of the power of eminent domain\"); Jamestown v. Leevers, 552 N.W.2d 365, 369, 374 (N.D. 1996) (\"the stimulation of commercial growth and removal of economic stagnation sought by [state urban redevelopment act allowing acquisition of nonblighted urban property `in furtherance of economic development'] are objectives satisfying the public use and purpose requirement of [federal and state public use clauses]\"; reversing and remanding because \"trial court made no finding whether the primary object of this development project is for the economic welfare of downtown Jamestown and its residents rather than for the benefit of private interests\"); see also Armendariz v. Penman, 75 F.3d 1311, 1321 (9th Cir. 1996) (stating in dicta that \"[i]f the city council . . . had by ordinance declared that a shopping center on the plaintiffs' property would serve a public use by, for example, increasing legitimate business traffic in the area and providing jobs for neighborhood residents, the city might have been able to acquire plaintiffs' property through the payment of just compensation, under the power of eminent domain\");[40] 99 Cents Only Stores v. Lancaster Redevelopment Agency, 237 F. Sup. 2d 1123, 1129-30 (C.D. Cal. 2001) (redevelopment agency's admitted use of eminent domain solely to satisfy \"private expansion demands\" of major anchor retailer violated federal public use clause, even under deferential analysis; court rejected as speculative argument that prevention of \"future blight\" upon departure of retailer was public use), appeal dismissed and remanded, 60 Fed. App. 123 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\nThis line of cases is wholly consistent with the broad[41] view of the public use clause that Connecticut and the federal courts follow. Accordingly, we find them persuasive, and we conclude that economic development plans that the appropriate legislative authority rationally has determined will promote municipal economic development by creating new jobs, increasing tax and other revenues, and otherwise revitalizing distressed urban areas, constitute a valid public use for the exercise of the eminent domain power under either the state or federal constitution.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that the Connecticut blight and substandard housing clearance cases, such as Katz v. Brandon, supra, 156 Conn. 533-34, and Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 143-44, are inapposite because in those cases the private sector economic development was secondary to the primary purpose of the redevelopment act, under which the applicable public use was the removal of harmful urban blight or substandard conditions. The plaintiffs also cite a competing line of sister state cases, notably Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental, LLC, 199 Ill. 2d 225, 240-41, 768 N.E.2d 1, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 880, 123 S. Ct. 88, 154 L. Ed. 2d 135 (2002), and urge this court to follow them and conclude that economic development is not, by itself, a public use that justifies the use of eminent domain. We address each of these contentions in turn.\n\nWe first address the plaintiffs' contention that the blight and substandard housing clearance cases, namely, Katz v. Brandon, supra, 156 Conn. 533, and Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 143-44, are inapplicable. Specifically, they contend that, in the present case, the primary legislative purpose is to transfer the property to private entities, which will become the primary beneficiary of the taking; accordingly, any benefit to the public from the taking is merely secondary. Their arguments contrast this scenario with that of the blight cases, wherein this court concluded that the primary purpose of the takings was the clearance of harmful urban conditions, with any benefit to private entities being secondary. Katz v. Brandon, supra, 534; Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 143-44. We disagree with the plaintiffs' contentions because we already have determined that municipal economic development can be, in and of itself, a constitutionally valid public use under the well established broad, purposive approach that we take on this issue under both the federal and state constitutions. Accordingly, we also conclude that private benefit from such economic development is, just as in the blight and substandard housing clearance cases, secondary to the public benefit that results from significant economic growth and revitalized financial stability in a community.\n\nWe next address the plaintiffs' analysis of the sister state cases, particularly Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental, LLC, supra, 199 Ill. 2d 235-41, that they cite in support of their contention that economic development projects do not, by themselves, constitute public use. We acknowledge that the courts of Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Washington have, using a narrow[42] view of their public use clauses, ruled that economic development is, by itself, not public use for eminent domain purposes. See Little Rock v. Raines, 241 Ark. 1071, 1083-84, 411 S.W.2d 486 (1967) (utilizing narrow definition of public use and noting lack of express legislative eminent domain authorization in concluding that taking for industrial park did not satisfy public use clause); Baycol, Inc. v. Downtown Development Authority, 315 So. 2d 451, 456-58 (Fla. 1975) (condemnation of land for construction of parking garage for private shopping mall not public use solely because of economic benefits; describing public benefit from garage construction as \"incidental\" and insufficient \"as a basis for public necessity justifying eminent domain\"); Owensboro v. McCormick, 581 S.W.2d 3, 5-8 (Ky. 1979) (using narrow view of public use under state constitution to strike statute granting city or other governmental unit \"unconditional right to condemn private property which [was] to be conveyed by the local industrial development authority for private development for industrial or commercial purposes\"; \"the constitutional provisions involved clearly require that finding of `public purpose' does not satisfy the requirement of a finding of `public use' \"); Opinion of the Justices, 152 Me. 440, 447, 131 A.2d 904 (1957) (advisory opinion following narrow view of state public use clause and concluding that statute authorizing city to use eminent domain for development of industrial park is unconstitutional); Merrill v. Manchester, 127 N.H. 234, 237-39, 499 A.2d 216 (1985) (using narrow public use analysis under state constitution and requiring direct public use in light of declared legislative policy of preserving open lands; enjoining taking of plaintiffs' open lands for industrial park construction); Karesh v. City Council, 271 S.C. 339, 342-45, 247 S.E.2d 342 (1978) (adhering to narrow view of public use under state constitution, and concluding that city could not condemn land and lease it to developer for parking garage and convention center project; noting that \"guarantee that the public will enjoy the use of the facilities, so necessary to the public use concept, is absent\"); In re Seattle, 96 Wash. 2d 616, 627-29, 638 P.2d 549 (1981) (using narrow view of state public use clause, without deference to legislature, and concluding retail shopping center \"contemplated a predominantly private, rather than public, use,\" noting that \"[a] beneficial use is not necessarily a public use\").[43]\n\nWe address separately, and in greater detail, the Illinois Supreme Court's recent decision in Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental, LLC, supra, 199 Ill. 2d 237-38, because the plaintiffs rely heavily on that case, and its analysis is distinct from the aforementioned decisions of the other states. In that case, the state legislature had created a regional economic development authority to promote industrial and economic development within a geographic project area. Id., 227-28. Under its enabling statute, the plaintiff had the authority to issue bonds and to exercise eminent domain. Id., 228.\n\nA successful and popular racetrack in the plaintiff's region desired to expand its seating and parking capacities. Id., 229. To increase parking, it wished to acquire a large parcel of land from an adjacent metal recycling center owned by the defendant. Id. The defendant refused to discuss the matter, and the racetrack never had offered to purchase the land. Id. Instead, the racetrack had asked the plaintiff to use its eminent domain powers to take the land and transfer it to the racetrack, with the racetrack paying all expenses for the taking. Id., 229-30. Thereafter, the county legislative body issued the required approval for the plaintiff's use of its eminent domain powers, concluding that expanded parking would be beneficial for the public safety, and also would increase the region's tax revenues. Id., 230. The plaintiff followed with a similar resolution. Id. Both the plaintiff and the racetrack continued to negotiate with the defendant for the purchase of the property; the negotiations failed and the plaintiff then filed a condemnation petition, which the trial court granted.[44] Id., 231.\n\nOn appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed the determination of the trial court. The Supreme Court cited Berman v. Parker, supra, 348 U.S. 26, and Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra, 467 U.S. 243-44, and undertook initially a generally broad, purposive police power analysis of the plaintiff's exercise of its eminent domain powers. Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental, LLC, supra, 199 Ill. 2d 235-36. The court, however, then qualified these statements by stating that \"a distinction still exists\" between \"public use\" and \"public purpose.\" Id., 237. Indeed, the court emphasized that \"[t]he public must be to some extent entitled to use or enjoy the property, not as a mere favor or by permission of the owner, but by right.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 238. Moreover, the court stated that while it has \"also recognized that economic development is an important public purpose . . . to constitute a public use, something more than a mere benefit to the public must flow from the contemplated improvement.\"[45] (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 239.\n\nUltimately, the court concluded that the taking violated the public use clauses of both federal and state constitutions. Id., 235, 240. The court did \"not require a bright-line test to find that this taking bestows a purely private benefit and lacks a showing of a supporting legislative purpose. . . . [M]embers of the public are not the primary intended beneficiaries of this taking. . . . This condemnation clearly was intended to assist [the racetrack] in accomplishing their goals in a swift, economical, and profitable manner.\" (Citations omitted.) Id., 240. The court stated that \"[the plaintiff's] true intentions were not clothed in an independent, legitimate governmental decision to further a planned public use.\"[46] Id. It further noted the plaintiff's responsiveness to the racetrack's demands, as well as the lack of planning studies and consideration of other alternatives, such as construction of a parking garage on the existing racetrack property.[47] Id., 241.\n\nWe disagree with the plaintiffs' contention that the Southwestern Illinois Development Authority stands for the proposition that economic development is never a constitutionally valid public use. Indeed, despite its use of a more restrictive public use standard than the purely purposive formulation followed by this court and the United States Supreme Court; Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra, 467 U.S. 243-44; Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 546-51; the Illinois decision strikes us more as an illustration of when a court determines that an economic development plan cannot be said to be for the public's benefit. In our view, the facts of Southwestern Illinois Development Authority merely demonstrate the far outer limit of the use of the eminent domain power for economic development. Indeed, that decision did not strike the statute allowing the agency to use eminent domain; it merely assailed the agency's exercise of that power within a particularly egregious set of facts. See Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental, LLC, supra, 199 Ill. 2d 240-41 (\"[c]learly the foundation of this taking is rooted not in the economic and planning process with which [the plaintiff] has been charged\"). Accordingly, the Illinois decision simply does not persuade us to abandon our conclusion that an economic development plan that the legislature rationally has determined will have the public benefits of increasing employment, tax and other revenues, and spurring the revitalization of a distressed city constitutes a valid public use for the exercise of the eminent domain power under either the state or federal constitution.\n\nMoreover, beyond the case law, we observe that many commentators within the academic community also have addressed the issue of whether economic development satisfies the constitutional public use requirement. Support for both sides of the issue, of course, may be found within this array of law review articles. We note that most, however, tend to express alarm at what they consider to be a situation rife with the potential for abuse of the eminent domain power. See, e.g., J. Lazzarotti, \"Public Use or Public Abuse,\" 68 UMKC L. Rev. 49, 74 (1999) (cautioning against overexpansive interpretation of terms \"public use\" or \"public purpose\"; noting \"if the only limit on meeting the public purpose requirement is what one can conceive or rationalize, the process is extremely vulnerable to abuse\"); S. Jones, note, \"Trumping Eminent Domain Law: An Argument for Strict Scrutiny Analysis Under the Public Use Requirement of the Fifth Amendment,\" 50 Syracuse L. Rev. 285, 288-89 (2000) (maintaining that private property rights are fundamental and proposing \"an analytical framework, whereby the condemnation authority must demonstrate a `compelling' socioeconomic need in transferring land to private interests\").[48] We, however, conclude that responsible judicial oversight over the ultimate public use question does much to quell the opportunity for abuse of the eminent domain power. We, of course, acknowledge the existence of particularly egregious cases, such as Armendariz v. Penman, supra, 75 F.3d 1320-21; see footnote 40 of this opinion; 99 Cents Only Stores v. Lancaster Redevelopment Agency, supra, 237 F. Sup. 2d 1129-30, and Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental, LLC, supra, 199 Ill. 2d 225. Such cases, however, would be outliers under the formulation that we adopt herein, which requires public economic benefit in order for the use of eminent domain for economic development to pass constitutional muster. As such, those cases are readily distinguishable from projects such as the carefully considered development plan at issue in the present case.[49] We, therefore, conclude that the plaintiffs have not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the provisions of chapter 132 of the General Statutes authorizing the use of eminent domain are facially unconstitutional when used in furtherance of an economic development plan such as the development plan in the present case.BWhether the Public Will Benefit Sufficiently from the CondemnationsThe plaintiffs next claim that, even if we were to assume that economic development constitutes a valid public use, the condemnations at issue in the present case do not serve that purpose because, the motives of the development corporation and the city aside, the effects of those condemnations primarily will benefit private entities, namely, the development corporation, Corcoran Jennison and Pfizer.[50] The plaintiffs claim that any public benefit is incidental and insignificant when compared to the private benefit to those entities that will result from the condemnations. The defendants contend, in response, that the public purpose is not defeated by the transfer of land to private entities, especially when successful achievement of the public purpose of economic development necessarily requires private sector involvement. We agree with the defendants.\n\nWe set forth the following additional facts that are relevant to the disposition of this claim. As stated previously, the development corporation will own the property after the condemnation; it will then lease the property to Corcoran Jennison for $1 per year for a term of ninety-nine years. With respect to Pfizer, the plaintiffs point out that it is, in the words of James Hicks, the executive vice president of RKG Associates, the firm that assisted the development corporation in the preparation of the development plan, the \"10,000 pound gorilla\" and \"a big driving point\" behind the development project. Specifically, the plaintiffs point out that Pfizer's \"requirements\"[51] had been met, namely, the inclusion within the development plan of a hotel for its clients and business associates, upscale housing for its employees, office space for its contractors, and other upgrades to the infrastructure of the general area.\n\nThe trial court's memorandum of decision, however, reveals that, although a great deal of consideration was given to the various demands and needs created by the new Pfizer facility, this consideration was given for the purpose of making the development plan more beneficial to the city. Indeed, Hicks testified that Pfizer's announcement was \"key\" because it was \"unusual\" for a major employer to move \"into an urban area, especially into a brown site . . . that has environmental problems. They tend to go to suburban areas, tend to go to green fields. Finding them coming there just offered a unique property for New London to take advantage of a number of things that would happen at that site for development.\"[52]\n\nHicks testified that he toured Pfizer's facilities during the development plan preparation process in order to gain a better understanding of its needs and the demands that it created. Pfizer did not tell him what details to add to the development plan, although he had been told that there was a need for a hotel as a result of Pfizer's arrival in the city. Hicks testified, however, that he was never told that Pfizer would not come to the city if the hotel was not built.[53]\n\nThe trial court also noted the testimony of William Longa, senior corporate counsel for Pfizer. Longa testified that Pfizer's only conditions for relocating its global development facility to the city were that: (1) the adjacent wastewater treatment facility be upgraded; (2) the state park be restored; and (3) its significant local investment be leveraged into a benefit for the entire city. He stated that Pfizer did make suggestions about \"certain functions that the company was involved in that were natural stepping stones that the community could use to its benefit to leverage the investment that the company had made in its own site.\" He stated that Pfizer had informed the development corporation of certain needs and demands that it had created, such as the company's guests who would need hotel space and employees who would need places to live.[54]\n\nLonga did testify that Pfizer never made specific demands about the locations of uses within the development plan. Pfizer will not have an ownership or management interest in any of the facilities located within the development plan area. The trial court also observed that the team who had drafted the development plan considered alternatives that did not fit the needs communicated by Pfizer. Indeed, the development plan itself does not mention Pfizer's desires in the section describing its reasoning for choosing the final of the six alternatives.\n\nThe trial court acknowledged an October 21, 1998 email to George Milne, president of Pfizer's research division, from James Serbia, a Pfizer employee involved in the development and management of company facilities. In the e-mail, Serbia indicated that he had left Milne with some concept drawings because of \"some confusion\" about Pfizer's \"expectations\" regarding the development of the Fort Trumbull area. The e-mail stated that Serbia thought the issue \"boils down to . . . whether or not Pfizer is flexible regarding the development plans\u2014I believe the answer is yes per all our previous discussions on this\u2014as long as some key components are included.\" It listed attractive residences, hotel and conference space, and upgrades to the wastewater treatment plant, state park and commercial space as \"key components.\" Serbia then asked Milne whether the following items would fit with his \"expectations\"\u2014 seventy to eighty upscale residential units, and a 250 unit hotel. The trial court noted that the development plan incorporates these features.[55]\n\nThe trial court relied on Katz v. Brandon, supra, 156 Conn. 531-34, and Bugryn v. Bristol, 63 Conn. App. 98, 107-108, 774 A.2d 1042, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 927, 776 A.2d 1143, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1019, 122 S. Ct. 544, 151 L. Ed. 2d 422 (2001), to begin with the proposition that a taking of land is impermissible if it is made primarily to benefit private interests. In other words, the primary purpose of the taking must be to serve the public interest; benefits to private entities must be incidental to this public purpose. The trial court also relied on Merrill v. Manchester, supra, 127 N.H. 237, for the use of a \"net benefit\" test, under which the \"benefits of the proposed project and the benefits of the eradication of any harmful characteristics of the property in its present form, [are] reduced by the social costs of the loss of the property in its present form. If the social costs exceed the probable benefits, then the project cannot be said to be built for a public use.\"\n\nThe trial court considered the facts in the context of these principles and concluded that, viewed in the context of the severe economic distress faced by the city, with its rising unemployment and stagnant tax revenues, the benefits to the city will outweigh those to Pfizer. The court noted that the hotel, with many of its rooms subsidized by Pfizer, will employ many people at a variety of skill levels, which would tie into the city's desire to rejuvenate its downtown area. The court did note that the concentrated high end housing would not likely have a \"multiplier\" effect, but would increase the tax rolls.\n\nWith respect to parcels 3 and 4A, the trial court noted that Pfizer did not press for the development of these parcels, or demand office space. Thus, with respect to these parcels, Pfizer would only \"tangentially benefit\" from their development. The court, therefore, concluded that the primary motivation for the city and the development corporation was to take advantage of Pfizer's presence,[56] and that the primary motivation and effect of the development plan and its condemnations was to benefit the distressed city, not Pfizer.\n\nMoreover, with respect to private entities besides Pfizer, the trial court concluded that \"[t]here is nothing in the record to indicate that as regards this project as a whole or considering parcel 3 and its planned office building separately . . . the city or the development corporation [was] motivated by a desire to aid particular private entities.\" The trial court noted that tenants for the office space had not been chosen, Corcoran Jennison was selected as developer from a group of applicants, and that the project was linked to the \"rejuvenation of the downtown area.\" Although the trial court acknowledged the \"social cost\"[57] of the implementation of the development plan, the court ultimately \"fail[ed] to see a relevant constitutional distinction between redevelopment cases and a situation such as this where the very fact of permitting economic development by private entities permits an economically struggling city to attempt to rejuvenate its downtown area, increase its job market, improve its housing stock and give it sufficient tax money to meet its needs.\"\n\nA trial court's determination that the legislative authority primarily intended a taking to benefit the public interest, rather than a private entity, is a question of fact that we review pursuant to the clearly erroneous standard of review. Bugryn v. Bristol, supra, 63 Conn. App. 103 (applying clearly erroneous standard to trial court's determination that benefiting local manufacturer was not primary purpose for taking). It is well established that \"[a] finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) DiMartino v. Richens, 263 Conn. 639, 661, 822 A.2d 205 (2003).\n\nWe begin our review of the trial court's finding with the proposition that the power of eminent domain must be used for a public use or purpose, and not primarily for the benefit of private entities. Moreover, \"[w]here the public use which justifies the taking of the area in the first instance exists . . . that same public purpose continues even though the property is later transferred to private persons.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Bugryn v. Bristol, supra, 63 Conn. App. 104, quoting Broadriver, Inc. v. Stamford, 158 Conn. 522, 533-34, 265 A.2d 75 (1969), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 938, 90 S. Ct. 1841, 26 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1970); see also Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 143-44. Although the courts afford great deference to the legislature's public use or purpose determination; Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra, 467 U.S. 244; Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 551; the public use question remains ultimately a judicial question. New York, N.H. & H. R. Co. v. Offield, supra, 77 Conn. 421. That element of judicial review, however deferential, would be hollow in the absence of a standard by which the courts can determine intelligently whether the public interest is paramount. Accordingly, we agree with the trial court's utilization of a purposive standard that also takes into account the actual public benefit from the taking.[58]\n\nThus, we conclude that an exercise of the eminent domain power would be an unreasonable violation of the public use clause if the facts and circumstances of the particular case reveal that the taking was primarily intended to benefit a private party, rather than primarily to benefit the public. See Katz v. Brandon, supra, 156 Conn. 534 (\"[t]here is nothing in the record to indicate that any conveyance of land has been made to [a manufacturing corporation] or that any agreement or understanding exists which would provide it with any advantage which is not available to others who may be interested as redevelopers\"); Bugryn v. Bristol, supra, 63 Conn. App. 104 (\"[e]ven if the taking [for an industrial park, an undisputed public use] would later provide a site for [a major local company], a consequence that would be neither undesirable to the defendants nor adverse to the goals that the park plan seeks to achieve, that fact would not support the plaintiffs' claim [of private taking] in light of the ample evidence in the record concerning the plan as a whole\"); Wilmington Parking Authority v. Land With Improvements, 521 A.2d 227, 232 (Del. 1986) (\"[A] primary purpose determination in a constitutional context will normally turn upon the `consequences and effects' of a proposed project. However . . . a reviewing court may consider evidence concerning the `underlying purpose' of a public authority in proposing a project.\");[59] Jamestown v. Leevers, supra, 552 N.W.2d 367 (recognizing economic development as public use, but remanding for finding as to \"whether the primary object of the development project was for the economic welfare of downtown Jamestown and its residents rather than for the primary benefit of private interests\").\n\nApplying this standard to the present case, we conclude that the trial court's finding that the takings were not primarily intended to benefit a private party, namely, Pfizer, is not clearly erroneous. The trial court's finding derives ample support from the record, particularly the fact that Pfizer's \"requirements,\" complained of by the plaintiffs, do not impact parcels 3 and 4A. Moreover, the testimony of Hicks, Longa and James Mahoney, executive director of the development corporation, supports the trial court's conclusion that Pfizer did not dictate the form of the development plan. Although it is undisputed that Pfizer's presence spurred many of the plans within the development plan, we view this factor as did the trial court; Pfizer's arrival in the city afforded the development corporation an opportunity to create an economic development plan that would go a long way toward the rejuvenation of a distressed city. Indeed, had the development corporation failed to consider demands created by the new Pfizer facility, its planning would have been unreasonable.\n\nMoreover, the trial court correctly identified the ample public benefits that the development plan, once implemented, was projected to provide. Assuming them to be correct,[60] the development plan projected the generation of hundreds of construction jobs, approximately 1000 direct jobs, and hundreds of indirect jobs. Moreover, the property tax revenues are expected to be between $680,544 and $1,249,843; this would be a significant increase for an area that presently produces $325,000 in property taxes. Most importantly, as the trial court astutely observed, these gains would occur in a city that, with the exception of the new Pfizer facility that employs approximately 2000 people, recently has experienced serious employment declines because of the loss of thousands of government and military positions. As the trial court noted, the city's unemployment rate is close to double that of the rest of the state. Indeed, as the trial court observed, the city's regional labor market was up 17 percent, in comparison to 45 percent for the region and 40 percent for the state as a whole. In light of these staggering economic figures, we conclude that the trial court did not commit clear error when it found that the development plan primarily was intended to benefit the public interest, rather than private entities.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim that \"[t]he purpose put forward by the defendants for these condemnations is that greater taxes will be generated if plaintiffs' homes are replaced by office buildings. That is true of nearly every home in the country. If greater tax revenues alone becomes a sufficient basis for condemnations in Connecticut, then Connecticut homeowners will lack any constitutional protection against eminent domain. Any home will be up for grabs to any private business that wants the property.\" This claim, while somewhat incalescent, affords us the opportunity to reiterate that an exercise of the eminent domain power is unreasonable, in violation of the public use clause, if the facts and circumstances of the particular case reveal that the taking specifically is intended to benefit a private party. Thus, we emphasize that our decision is not a license for the unchecked use of the eminent domain power as a tax revenue raising measure; rather, our holding is that rationally considered municipal economic development projects such as the development plan in the present case pass constitutional muster.CAssurances of Future Public UseThe plaintiffs next contend that the condemnations of the properties on parcels 3 and 4A lack \"reasonable assurances of future public use.\"[61] Before we turn to the specifics of the plaintiffs' claim, we note that both the plaintiffs' briefs and our research reveal no primary or secondary authorities that actually utilize the term \"reasonable assurances of future public use.\" Nevertheless, the plaintiffs, relying primarily on Casino Reinvestment Development Authority v. Banin, 320 N.J. Super. 342, 354-58, 727 A.2d 102 (1998), contend specifically that there is no assurance that the acquired properties will be used in accordance with the purposes of the development plan, because the development corporation owns the property, the city will not be a party to the development agreement with Corcoran Jennison, and the ultimate property uses will thus be chosen by private entities. The plaintiffs also claim that the trial court improperly concluded that supervision of the development corporation by the department, pursuant to chapter 132 of the General Statutes, will assure the future use of the property in accordance with the development plan because that supervision is financial and does not extend to the use of eminent domain. Finally, the plaintiffs claim, solely in regard to parcel 4A, that it is impossible to find reasonable assurances of future public use when the condemnor does not know what it is going to do with that parcel. The defendants contend in response that: (1) the development plan contains land use restrictions that assure future uses will be consistent with its purpose; and (2) land projects such as the development plan require time to complete; in other words, that \"Fort Trumbull will not be built in a day.\" We agree with the defendants.\n\nWe first set forth the standard of review. A trial court's determination that there are sufficient statutory and contractual constraints in place to provide reasonable assurances of future public use is a question of fact, and \"our review is limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous.\" Powers v. Olson, 252 Conn. 98, 105, 742 A.2d 799 (2000). It is well established that \"[a] finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) DiMartino v. Richens, supra, 263 Conn. 661.[62]\n\nIn the present case, the trial court concluded that the city's lack of future involvement does not mean that the development corporation and the developers are not bound to use the property in accordance with the terms of the development plan. The trial court stated that the state, functioning through the department, is a signatory to the development agreement; it \"provides the funding without which nothing goes forward.\"[63] The court then discussed several provisions of the development plan that assure that future land use will be on the terms contained therein, namely: (1) the durational clause providing that \"[t]he development plan and/or any modification hereof shall be in full force and effect for a period of thirty years from the date of first approval of this development plan by the city council of the city\"; and (2) other land use restrictions contained therein.[64] The trial court concluded that, were a developer to violate these provisions, the development corporation could turn to the courts for relief; should the development corporation refuse to do so, the city could then terminate its arrangement with the development corporation and appoint a new development agency.\n\nWe conclude that the trial court properly determined that there are sufficient statutory and contractual constraints in place to assure that private sector participants will adhere to the provisions of the development plan. We agree with the trial court that the terms of the development plan providing parcel-specific land uses, to which private developers participating in the project must adhere, provide significant control over the destiny of the parcels. See footnote 64 of this opinion. We also conclude that the trial court properly determined that the significant state involvement in this project, mandated by chapter 132 of the General Statutes, functions to provide a level of governmental oversight beyond that provided by the development corporation. See footnote 63 of this opinion. Finally, we conclude that despite the lack of formal commitments to the use of parcel 4A, there are sufficient assurances that the public use of the development plan will be carried out. We, therefore, reject the plaintiffs' claim that the existence of the development agreement requiring that the property be \"primarily\" developed in accordance with the development plan, which is in effect for thirty years, is no assurance because only the development corporation may enforce it.[65]\n\nAccordingly, the plaintiffs' reliance on Casino Reinvestment Development Authority v. Banin, supra, 320 N.J. Super. 342, is misplaced. In that case, the casino development authority had sought to take properties by eminent domain for the declared purpose of providing parking, green space and roadway access to an adjacent renovated hotel and casino complex owned by Trump Plaza Associates (Trump). Id., 347. After the taking, the land would be transferred to Trump for redevelopment. Id. The court concluded that the primary consequence and effect of the taking was to benefit Trump because there was no adequate assurance that the property would be used by Trump for those purposes declared as justifications for the taking.[66] Id., 355-56. In so concluding, the court noted that the agreements between the casino authority and Trump did not: (1) impose time restrictions on changes in the land use; or (2) require expressly that Trump use the acquired properties solely for the purpose for which they were taken; rather, they used the language \"hotel development project and appurtenant facilities.\" Id., 356.\n\nThe New Jersey court interpreted the \"overbroad\" term of \"hotel development project and appurtenant facilities\" as allowing Trump \"to eliminate the park and fill the entire block with an expanded casino hotel . . . without [casino development authority] approval.\" Id. The court, therefore, concluded that the casino development authority's determination that the takings \"fulfilled a public purpose\" was unreasonable because, \"[i]n looking at the consequences and effects of these condemnation actions the court must conclude that under the circumstances present here, any potential public benefit is overwhelmed by the private benefit received by Trump in the form of assemblage and future control over development and use of parcels of prime real estate in Atlantic City.\"[67] Id., 358; see also Vicksburg v. Thomas, 645 So. 2d 940, 943 (Miss. 1994) (The taking of property for the construction of a riverboat casino was impermissible when the \"[c]ity failed to provide conditions, restrictions, or covenants in its contract with [the casino] to ensure that the property will be used for the purpose of gaming enterprise or other related establishments. In fact, testimony indicates that [the casino] may do anything it wishes with [the defendant's] property . . . .\").\n\nThus, we conclude that the plaintiffs' reliance on Casino Reinvestment Development Authority v. Banin, supra, 320 N.J. Super. 342, is misplaced because of the previously discussed controls that exist by statute and under the development plan in the present case, particularly when compared to the flexibility that impermissibly was afforded to the private entities in that case and in Vicksburg v. Thomas, 645 So. 2d 943. The oversight and rigorous land use restrictions that are present with the development plan simply did not exist in Casino Reinvestment Development Authority.[68]III\n\nWHETHER THE DELEGATION OF THE EMINENT DOMAIN POWER TO THE DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION WAS UNCONSTITUTIONALThe plaintiffs next claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the city's delegation of the eminent domain power to the development corporation was constitutionally valid. Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that, in concluding that the delegation was constitutional, the trial court incorrectly determined that the development corporation satisfied the test for the constitutionality of delegations set forth in Connecticut College v. Calvert, 87 Conn. 421, 427, 88 A. 633 (1913), and Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 144-45. The defendants claim, in response, that the delegation in the present case is constitutionally valid because the development corporation is the city's statutorily authorized agent for the implementation of the development plan, a constitutionally valid public purpose, and is not acting to further its own operations. We agree with the defendants.\n\nThe record reveals the following additional undisputed facts relevant to the disposition of the plaintiffs' delegation claim. The development corporation is a Connecticut nonprofit, private economic development corporation that originally was formed in 1978, and reactivated in 1997. In May, 1998, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-188,[69] the city council had adopted a resolution approving the designation of the development corporation as the city's \"[d]evelopment agency\" or \"[i]mplementing agency.\" Thereafter, in January, 2000, the city council approved the development plan as conceived by the development corporation,[70] and appointed the development corporation to implement the development plan.[71] The January, 2000 resolution also expressly had authorized the development corporation, in the city's name, pursuant to \u00a7 8-193 (a), to use the power of eminent domain within the project area if necessary to acquire properties for development. See footnote 71 of this opinion. Subsequently, in October, 2000, the development corporation enacted a resolution that exercised its power of eminent domain to acquire, in the city's name, certain properties within the project area, including those of the plaintiffs.[72] Indeed, we note that the development corporation resolution emphasized specifically the city's approval of the use of eminent domain, pursuant to \u00a7 8-193.\n\nThe trial court concluded that \"from the perspective of political control over the [development corporation] by the city's legislative body, it can hardly be said that the [development corporation] vis-a-vis that entity is some free-wheeling private body attendant to its own affairs and acting as only it sees fit.\"[73] The trial court then cited the analysis of Connecticut College v. Calvert, supra, 87 Conn. 427, 430, as discussed in Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 144, for the proposition that \"the exercise of eminent domain by the government itself or a public agency thereof is different from its exercise by a private person to whom the government has granted the power. And, in the second place, the basis of the decision is . . . that when a private person is granted the power to appropriate property, it must be for a use to which `the public will have a common right upon equal terms, independently of the will or caprice of the corporation.'\" The trial court then stated that this court, in Gohld Realty Co., seemed to presume, without actually ruling, that an urban redevelopment agency is a public agency, before it concluded that blight removal was a public use in and of itself, regardless of the subsequent transfer to private developers. Id., 145. On the basis of its analysis of the statutory framework governing the operation of the development corporation; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-188, 8-189 and 8-193 (a); the trial court then concluded that it did not accept the plaintiffs' delegation argument because: (1) it deemed the development corporation more a public agency than a private entity; and (2) the public use prong of the test was more appropriately analyzed in the context of whether economic development was a public use.\n\nWe first set forth the appropriate standard of review. The plaintiffs' claim involves only the trial court's application of the constitutional standard of Connecticut College v. Calvert, supra, 87 Conn. 427, 430, to the undisputed facts. Our review of this question of law, therefore, is plenary. See, e.g., Cunha v. Colon, 260 Conn. 15, 18 n.6, 792 A.2d 832 (2002).\n\nOur analysis begins with a brief review of this court's decision in Connecticut College v. Calvert, supra, 87 Conn. 427-30. In Connecticut College, the petitioner had challenged an act whereby the legislature had granted the right of eminent domain to a private educational corporation. Id., 423. The court \"accept[ed] and endorse[d] the legislative declaration that the higher education of women is in its nature a public use,\" stating, however, that \"the question whether in any given instance the use is or will be administered as a public or as a private use, is a question which must of necessity be determined by the courts in accordance with the facts of the particular case in hand.\" Id., 428. The court relied on Evergreen Cemetery Assn. v. Beecher, 53 Conn. 551, 552-53, 5 A. 353 (1886), in which this court refused to permit a private cemetery association to take land by eminent domain for cemetery purposes,[74] and stated that the fundamental inquiry in cases of the delegation to private parties is \"whether it appears that the public will have a common right upon equal terms, independently of the will or caprice of the corporation, to the use and enjoyment of the property sought to be taken.\" (Emphasis added.) Connecticut College v. Calvert, supra, 430. The court expanded further, stating that\"the right of eminent domain cannot constitutionally be delegated to a private person or corporation unless for a use which is governmental in its nature, and unless the public has or can acquire a common right on equal terms to the use or benefit of the property taken; except only that the use, or right of use by the public, may be dispensed with when a public benefit results from the taking, which cannot otherwise be realized, and which continues to exist although the public has no use or benefit of the property taken.\"\n\n(Emphasis added.) Id., 435.\n\nThe court applied this principle, and concluded that, even having accepted the college's argument that \"the higher education of women is a matter of great public utility\"; id., 436; the public would not necessarily have the right to enjoy the benefits of the land because the college did not have a legal obligation to admit \"to its courses of instruction all qualified candidates, to the extent of its capacity, without religious, racial, or social distinction.\" Id., 435-36. The court relied on a series of sister state public spending cases that distinguished private colleges like Connecticut College from public universities open to all qualified candidates, ultimately concluding that the grant of the eminent domain power was unconstitutional because of the exclusively private benefits from that grant of the eminent domain power to a private condemnor. Id., 438-39.\n\nWe most recently restated the rule of Connecticut College in Carofano v. Bridgeport, 196 Conn. 623, 632, 495 A.2d 1011 (1985), wherein this court rejected a claim that General Statutes \u00a7 7-473c, the mandatory binding arbitration statute, was an unconstitutional delegation of the legislative power because \"the arbitrators are not public officials accountable to the electorate.\" The court in Carofano discussed, inter alia, delegations of the eminent domain power, and cited Connecticut College as standing for the proposition that\"the delegation of the governmental power of eminent domain to private persons rather than to public officials has frequently been approved where a public purpose is thereby advanced and where the benefit of the property taken is considered to be available to the general public.\"\n\n(Emphasis added.) Id., 633. Indeed, this court \"perceive[d] no inherent vice that should preclude enlistment by the legislature of private individuals or agencies to achieve a public purpose by the exercise of a governmental power so long as adequate safeguards are provided. Although elected officials and those appointed by them as public officers may be more directly answerable to the electorate for their doings, the principle of accountability remains viable in the ability of legislators to terminate or modify any delegation of legislative power that has been made and in the ultimate authority of the people to change the law by electing those amenable to the public will.\" Id., 633-34.\n\nAlthough Carofano v. Bridgeport, supra, 196 Conn. 633-34, is not an eminent domain case, we find persuasive its rearticulation of the Connecticut College formulation that is applicable when the eminent domain authority has been delegated to a private entity. Its emphasis on public purpose and benefit is more harmonious with the well established purposive approach that we follow presently in resolving questions of public use, than the claim that Connecticut College requires actual access by the public. See, e.g., Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 551. Indeed, this court implicitly recognized this in Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 143-44, when the court concluded that the rule of Connecticut College did not apply because, \"[i]f the public use which justifies the exercise of eminent domain in the first instance is the use of the property for purposes other than slums, that same public use continues after the property is transferred to private persons. The public purposes for which the land was taken are still being accomplished.\" Moreover, the Carofano approach to delegation analysis is especially compatible with the concept that many governmental endeavors, such as economic development or urban renewal, may be accomplished more expeditiously when governmental authorities are afforded the opportunity to utilize the expertise and resources of the private sector. Accordingly, we conclude that Carofano sets forth the appropriate standard to apply to the eminent domain delegation in the present case.\n\nWe now apply the Connecticut College standard, as articulated in Carofano v. Bridgeport, supra, 196 Conn. 633-34, to the delegation in the present case.[75] At the outset, we note that it is undisputed that the development corporation is a private entity. We next turn to the second prong, which itself is bifurcated into two factors: (1) whether \"a public purpose is thereby advanced\"; and (2) \"where the benefit of the property taken is considered to be available to the general public.\" Id., 633. Accordingly, we also note that we previously have concluded that the development plan in the present case constitutes an economic development plan that is, by itself, a public use or purpose under either the federal or state constitution. See part II A of this opinion. The \"advancing a public purpose\" factor, therefore, is satisfied because the delegation effectuates the public purpose directly, by giving the development corporation the power to acquire real property for the implementation of the development plan.\n\nA more complex inquiry in the present case, however, is whether \"the benefit of the property taken is considered to be available to the general public.\" Carofano v. Bridgeport, supra, 196 Conn. 633. The plaintiffs claim that, under Connecticut College, availability to the general public requires public entrance into, or the benefits of tenancy in, the office buildings planned for construction on parcel 3. They further claim that such direct benefit is unavailable because the tenants will be selected solely by Corcoran Jennison, and not the development corporation or the city.[76] The defendants contend, in response, that direct access is not required because the public use of economic development necessarily requires the development corporation to turn the property over to private developers and their tenants, and that the development corporation is, unlike the college in Connecticut College, not acting in furtherance of its own benefit. We agree with the defendants.\n\nWe note that the Connecticut College rule as stated in Carofano, requires only that the \"benefit\" of the taking be available to the general public. Id. We conclude that the public benefit of the taking in the present case is the dramatic economic benefit that the development plan is expected to have for the public in the NewLondon community, namely, the massive projected growths in employment and tax and other revenues. Indeed, the rule of Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 144, is particularly applicable, because in the present case, the public use and benefit in the first instance is the economic revitalization; accordingly, that \"same public use continues after the property is transferred to private persons. The public purposes for which the land was taken are still being accomplished.\" Id., 143-44.\n\nMoreover, in the present case, the development corporation is not acting exclusively for its own benefit, unlike in Connecticut College, wherein the college sought to acquire property to further its own operations. Connecticut College v. Calvert, supra, 87 Conn. 423-24. In the present case, the development corporation is acting to implement a development plan whose property acquisition provisions already have been accepted by the city itself; indeed, as the city resolved in January, 2000, after approving the development plan, the development corporation acquired the properties in the name of the city, pursuant to \u00a7 8-193 (a).[77] Accordingly, we conclude that the delegation of the eminent domain authority to the development corporation was not unconstitutional.IV\n\nPARCEL 3 REASONABLE NECESSITY CLAIMSAWhether the Taking of the Properties on Parcel 3 Was Reasonably NecessaryThe plaintiffs next claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the taking of the four homes located on parcel 3 was \"reasonably necessary\" to achieve the intended public use because keeping the homes there would make the marketing and development of the intended office space more \"difficult.\" Specifically, they claim that expert testimony introduced at trial indicated that there were alternatives available that would permit the office space intended for parcel 3 to be constructed exactly as planned without taking the homes. The defendants contend, in response, that the trial court properly deferred to the legislative determination of necessity, with respect to the parcel 3 properties, because there was no evidence that the takings were unreasonable, the product of bad faith, or an abuse of the power conferred. We agree with the defendants.\n\nThe record and the trial court's memorandum of decision reveal the following additional facts and procedural history. The trial court began its review of the necessity of taking the properties on parcel 3 by stating that it would follow the deferential approach articulated in Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 146, and would review the legislative determination of necessity to \"discover if it was unreasonable or in bad faith or was an abuse of the power conferred.\" The court reviewed the governing legal principles and the competing testimony submitted by the parties' planning experts. The trial court then began its factual analysis by discussing the testimony of the plaintiffs' expert, John Mullin, a professor of economic and industrial development at the University of Massachusetts.[78] Mullin testified that he had reviewed the development plan and had visited the Fort Trumbull area, and that the plaintiffs' four properties occupied slightly more than three quarters of one acre of parcel 3. He testified that it is uncommon for land and housing to be cleared entirely for new development in urban waterfront areas. Mullin testified that, in his opinion, the taking of the four homes on parcel 3 was not reasonably necessary to carry out the goals of the development plan in that parcel, which included offices, parking, and the retention of the Italian Dramatic Club. He testified that retaining the homes was a \"no-brainer\" because of the small amount of land that they occupy, as well as their location on the parcel in \"reasonable clusters\"; three homes together in a row and one immediately adjacent to the Italian Dramatic Club.\n\nMullin then discussed an alternate proposal that he had created in conjunction with an architectural firm. He testified that this proposal provided the same parking and office space as the present development plan, without taking the plaintiffs' homes, but also added new homes. On cross-examination, Mullin testified that his plan would have located the office buildings and new homes overlooking a sewage treatment plant; a location that ideally was better suited for parking than these structures, although such uses could be mixed.[79] Mullin testified that, in his opinion, the development plan was a good plan with the exception of its treatment of the existing housing.\n\nThe court then discussed the defendants' evidence, which consisted chiefly of the testimony of Hicks from RKG Associates,[80] which is the real estate planning and economic development consulting firm that aided the development corporation in preparing the development plan. Hicks stated that the team that prepared the plan primarily had wished to take advantage of Pfizer's unique decision to build a major facility in the city.[81]\n\nHicks discussed the six alternate plans that were considered; see footnote 6 of this opinion; and testified that, although two of the plans provided for the retention of existing housing, they were unworkable because it is difficult to turn residential properties into office space, which would frustrate the plan's goal of economic development. Hicks then explained how clearing all of the parcels was necessary to the success of the development plan, stating that RKG Associates had recommended this approach to the development corporation because it would make the area far more attractive for the crucial private sector investment and development. Moreover, Hicks testified that, even if retaining the homes under a plan like Mullin's was feasible, in his professional opinion, \"it would make it much, much more difficult for [the development corporation] and probably would lead to a situation that certain parts of the site would probably have a much higher degree of difficulty in being developed.\"[82]\n\nThe trial court also reviewed the deposition testimony of Marty Jones, the president of Corcoran Jennison.[83] She testified that in early 1999, the development corporation selected Corcoran Jennison through a competitive bidding process to develop parcels 1, 2 and 3 of the development plan. A full development agreement between Corcoran Jennison and the development corporation still was being negotiated at the time of trial; there would, however, be a ground lease of the Fort Trumbull development area land from the development corporation to Corcoran Jennison for nominal rent, such as $1 per year. While the agreement was being negotiated between the development corporation, the department, and Corcoran Jennison, with the city being \"intimate[ly]\" involved, the development corporation and Corcoran Jennison had been working cooperatively under a letter of intent.\n\nCorcoran Jennison's architectural staff has created site plans that comply with the terms of the development plan for the actual development of the parcels.[84] With respect to parcel 3, the trial court credited Jones' testimony that it would be \"difficult [for Corcoran Jennison] to attract a commercial tenant to these commercial office buildings without a full site available for the development of an office building and the associated parking.\"[85]\n\nAfter reviewing the testimony[86] and the relevant exhibits, the trial court credited the effort that went into the creation and formatting of the development plan. The court stated that, although it did \"not conclude there is an absolute necessity to take the property at the present time, [it] believes and, at the least, has no basis to doubt the reasonableness of the testimony of . . . Hicks and . . . Jones that development would be more difficult if these residences were allowed to remain.\" The trial court concluded that accepting the plaintiffs' argument would result in it \"choos[ing] an alternative to development different from the alternative chosen by the agency appointed to prepare the [development plan],\" and stated ultimately that \"[t]he decision on which the necessity for the takings as set forth in the [development plan] and the present need for the takings of these particular properties involve the weighing of factors for which courts are not well equipped and which reflect broad `legislative' type judgments which are best left to the appointed agencies of legislative bodies at state and local level and experienced state agencies all of which were involved and are involved in this taking process and the decisions which have led to it.\" Accordingly, the trial court denied the plaintiffs' request for permanent injunctive relief against the condemnation of their properties located in parcel 3, although it did grant temporary injunctive relief pending the appellate resolution of this case.\n\nWe begin by setting forth the standard of review. As an initial matter, the question of \"[w]hether the purpose for which a statute authorizes the condemnation of property constitutes a public use is, in the end, a judicial question to be resolved by the courts . . . but, in resolving it, great weight must be given to the determination of the legislature.\" (Citation omitted.) Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 141. In part II of this opinion, we concluded that economic development projects created and implemented pursuant to chapter 132 of the General Statutes that have the public economic benefits of creating new jobs, increasing tax and other revenues, and contributing to urban revitalization, namely, the development plan in the present case, satisfy the public use clauses of the federal and state constitutions.\n\nThe level of judicial review applicable to a development agency's determination of what land is reasonably necessary for the effectuation of an economic development plan, such as the development plan in this case, presents a matter of first impression for this court. The Appellate Court, however, in Bugryn v. Bristol, supra, 63 Conn. App. 107-108, has concluded that the deferential standards of review applicable to that determination by a redevelopment agency in a redevelopment case under chapter 130 of the General Statutes; see, e.g., Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 259 Conn. 599-601; Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 146; also apply to the use of eminent domain in an economic development case under chapter 132 of the General Statutes. Thus, \"[i]t is well settled that `[t]he determination of what property is necessary to be taken in any given case in order to effectuate the public purpose is, under our constitution, a matter for the exercise of the legislative power. When the legislature delegates the making of that determination to another agency, the decision of that agency is conclusive; it is open to judicial review only to discover if it was unreasonable or in bad faith or was an abuse of the power conferred.' Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, [146].\" Bugryn v. Bristol, supra, 107. We agree with the Appellate Court, and we conclude that this is the appropriate standard to apply during judicial review of the implementation of an economic development plan. Moreover, under this standard it is \"the plaintiff [who has] the burden of establishing that the taking . . . was unreasonable, in bad faith or an abuse of power.\" Hall v. Weston, 167 Conn. 49, 66, 355 A.2d 79 (1974); accord Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 598; Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 146.\n\nThe trial court, of course, makes the first judicial assessment of the legislative or agency determination of necessity. Thus, \"[a]s a reviewing court, we are bound to determine whether the court's factual determination that the defendants did not act unreasonably in seeking to acquire all of the plaintiffs' property was clearly erroneous.\" (Emphasis added.) Bugryn v. Bristol, supra, 63 Conn. App. 108. Whether the legislative body acted in \"bad faith or . . . abuse[d] . . . the power conferred\" also are questions of fact for the trial court that an appeals court reviews for clear error. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 107; cf. AvalonBay Communities, Inc. v. Orange, 256 Conn. 557, 565, 579-80, 775 A.2d 284 (2001) (municipality's project plan was \"pretext . . . to thwart affordable housing\"; \"the record fully support[ed] the trial court's finding that the [chapter 132] project plan was hastily assembled, poorly envisioned and incomplete\"). It is well established that \"[a] finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) DiMartino v. Richens, supra, 263 Conn. 661.\n\nFurthermore, \"[t]he governing principles for our standard of review as it pertains to a trial court's discretion to grant or deny a request for an injunction [are]: A party seeking injunctive relief has the burden of alleging and proving irreparable harm and lack of an adequate remedy at law. . . . A prayer for injunctive relief is addressed to the sound discretion of the court and the court's ruling can be reviewed only for the purpose of determining whether the decision was based on an erroneous statement of law or an abuse of discretion. . . . Therefore, unless the trial court has abused its discretion, or failed to exercise its discretion . . . the trial court's decision must stand.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 259 Conn. 598.\n\nWe conclude that the trial court did not commit clear error in upholding as a factual matter the development corporation's determination that the parcel 3 takings were reasonably necessary to effectuate the goals of the development plan. Noting that \"there is no evidence, credible or otherwise, that the condemnations in parcel 3 as originally envisaged in the [development plan] or at the time of the taking were done in bad faith, or not with an honest motive, or based on [any] pretext given any reasonable definition of the word,\" the court recognized that economic development planning is not the province of the courts and thus, properly deferred to the development corporation's necessity determination. (Emphasis added.) The trial court's determination with respect to parcel 3 derives ample support from the record, particularly as it credited the testimony of Goebel, Hicks and Jones as they described the deliberative process that ultimately produced the development plan. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not commit clear error when it determined that the development corporation's reasonable necessity determination was not the product of bad faith, unreasonableness, or an abuse of the power conferred. The court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion by denying the plaintiffs the injunctive relief requested.\n\nWe note that the plaintiffs rely on our reasoning in Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 259 Conn. 592, and contend that the taking of their property is not reasonably necessary just because that taking will make it easier for Corcoran Jennison to market the office buildings to potential tenants. Specifically, the plaintiffs refer to our statements in Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc., a redevelopment case under chapter 130 of the General Statutes, quoting the trial court as stating that \"[j]ust because the property may be desirable to the defendants does not justify its taking by eminent domain\"; (internal quotation marks omitted) id., 606; and that \"[t]he city provided no specific reasons, other than to enhance desirability of the area to investors, as to why the plaintiff's property, which both parties stipulated to be in good condition, is essential to the accomplishment of the redevelopment plan.\" Id., 605.\n\nThe plaintiffs' reliance on Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc., however, is misplaced because our holding in that case specifically was based on General Statutes \u00a7 8-125 (b),[87] which provides that nonblighted property located in a blighted area \"may be taken by eminent domain when the property is essential to complete a development\"; id., 604-605; as well as case law \"establish[ing] that a redevelopment agency must make reasonable efforts to negotiate and consider the integration of the property that is not substandard into the overall redevelopment plan.\" Id., 603. In Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc., the plaintiffs' property was in good condition, but was surrounded by a blighted area with deteriorating properties. Id., 604. The city, however, had refused to negotiate or correspond with the yacht club, or to consider integrating the yacht club's property into the plan, despite the yacht club's expressed willingness to be incorporated into the final redevelopment plan, which included making changes to its property if necessary. Id., 605-606. We concluded that the trial court properly ordered the city to reconvey the property back to the yacht club because \"the defendants acted unreasonably when they failed to consider or even discuss integration of the plaintiff's property into the redevelopment plan and that the defendants had failed to establish that taking of the plaintiff's property by eminent domain was therefore necessary and essential to the redevelopment plan.\" Id., 606.\n\nWe conclude that the present case is readily distinguishable from Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. First, Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 259 Conn. 599-600, is a redevelopment case under chapter 130 of the General Statutes; in such cases, the public use is blight clearance. Thus, the public use in such cases is accomplished as soon as the blighted conditions are cleared, regardless of the land's subsequent attractiveness to investors. See, e.g., Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 143-44. Thus, nonblighted property located in blighted areas is subject to the essentiality requirement of \u00a7 8-125 (b), a statutory requirement that does not exist under chapter 132 of the General Statutes. See Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 603-606. In contrast, in the present case, the public use is, by itself, the economic revitalization of the city. See part II of this opinion. Thus, for the development corporation to ignore considerations of investment and marketability would frustrate the effectuation of its project's public purpose, and would be an unreasonable and arbitrary legislative act. We, therefore, conclude that our decision in Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc., does not require us to hold that the parcel 3 taking in the present case was not reasonably necessary.CWhether the Parcel 3 Takings Are for Reasonably Foreseeable NeedsThe plaintiffs next contend that the trial court improperly concluded that the parcel 3 development was not impermissibly speculative because the office buildings will not be constructed unless a market develops for them. The defendants contend, in response, that the trial court properly concluded that the development of parcel 3 was not impermissibly speculative because of the logical progression that such long-term development projects necessarily follow. We agree with the defendants.\n\nThe record reveals the following additional facts relevant to the disposition of this claim. A market analysis completed in January, 1999, by RKG Associates for the preparation of the development plan stated that, at that time, rent levels for class A office buildings had stabilized and that \"[r]eal estate conditions in the [city] have shown signs of modest recovery,\" as evidenced by a greater than 90 percent occupancy rate in those buildings. It acknowledged that those rent levels \"remain below the level needed to support new speculative construction,\" and that \"the historic sales values of [c]lass A office space, created by the past imbalances in the market, have not recovered sufficiently to justify new construction except for an end-user.\" It did state, however, that by 2010, a shortage of office and research and development space is expected within the Fort Trumbull area, and that \"land area at Fort Trumbull should be reserved for the future development of office buildings.\"\n\nIn addition to the development plan, the trial court also considered a report entitled, \"Marketing Plan for Commercial Development Space\" (report), which was presented by Jones to other Corcoran Jennison officers in January, 2001. The report echoed the development plan's analysis and concluded that then current \"market conditions do not justify [the] construction of new commercial space at Fort Trumbull on a speculative basis.\" In the short term, the report recommended the renovation of \"[b]uilding 2,\" which is an existing office building constructed in 1991 and located at the closed United States Naval Undersea Warfare Center. The report, however, stated that long-term commercial development would have a \"target market\" of \"newly recruited companies evidencing Pfizer-related demand, whether it is for general office use or biotech/bioscience use. This demand will most likely come from out-of-region companies that contract with Pfizer and value proximity to Pfizer's [g]lobal [d]evelopment [f]acility.\"\n\nThe trial court noted that a major goal of the development plan is to capitalize on the presence of Pfizer, and that the report and the development plan both were prepared prior to the construction and occupancy of the new global research facility. The court then credited the testimony of Bruce Hyde, the city's director of real estate development and planning, who testified that, although the market for office space in the city was \"on the softer side,\" since the Pfizer announcement in 1998, there had been increased interest in real estate development in the city.[88] The court also noted Hicks' testimony that Pfizer's business associates likely would occupy future office space in the Fort Trumbull area.\n\nFinding no Connecticut authority directly on point, the trial court relied on sister state authority for the proposition that there need not be an immediate need for the property taken; planning for the future and changes in public needs are permissible, so long as the public use will be accomplished within a reasonable period of time. The trial court noted that \"whether the effort is speculative in a particular case depends to a great extent on the nature of the public use involved,\" and that the legislature's assessment of whether a need is speculative receives the same judicial deference as other legislative necessity determinations; thus, the court will only disturb it if it is the product of bad faith, unreasonableness, or an abuse of discretion.\n\nApplying these standards, the court concluded that \"at least that in selected cases, cities like New London, given its economic situation, should be given time to develop a site which has built-in features that would be attractive to users\u2014here, we have a city just beginning to come out of the economic doldrums, with a major international company alighting in its midst that has the ability to attract other businesses . . . .\" Noting the prediction of a demand for space by 2010, and that substantial state and local resources and funds already had been spent on preparing the Fort Trumbull area for economic development, the court concluded that it could not \"say that under the circumstances of this case that the planned development of parcel 3 is too speculative given the purpose of the development plan\u2014economic development of an economically distressed community.\"\n\nWe will review the trial court's decision, as we do other reasonable necessity determinations, for clear error in determining the existence of bad faith, unreasonableness, or abuse of power on the part of the legislature in making the initial determination of whether the need is speculative, and therefore, not reasonably foreseeable. See Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 259 Conn. 599-601; Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 146; Adams v. Greenwich Water Co., 138 Conn. 205, 213-14, 83 A.2d 177 (1951); Bugryn v. Bristol, supra, 63 Conn. App. 107-108.\n\nWe begin our analysis of the trial court's conclusion by reviewing the applicable legal principles. A taking that is purely speculative is not reasonably necessary. New Haven Water Co. v. Russell, 86 Conn. 361, 369-70, 85 A. 379 (1912) (population growth and increasing demand justify taking of streams by water company). We note, however, that \"[o]n the question of the necessity of a taking, needs which will arise in the reasonably foreseeable future must be taken into consideration.\" Adams v. Greenwich Water Co., supra, 138 Conn. 214 (considering ten year water demand projections and stating that it was reasonably necessary for water company to create reservoir by damming river); accord Phoenix v. McCullough, 536 P.2d 230, 236 (Ariz. App. 1975) (\"[T]he condemning authority may, in acquiring private property for public use, take not only such property as is necessary to satisfy present needs, but may acquire such additional property as will be put to public use within a reasonable time thereafter. In determining what constitutes a reasonable time, the surrounding circumstances must be considered.\"); Grand Rapids Board of Education v. Baczewski, 340 Mich. 265, 271-72, 65 N.W.2d 810 (1954) (school board could not justify taking property thirty years before its need was anticipated solely on basis of saving future taxpayers' money).\n\nSeveral sister state cases also considered by the trial court in its memorandum of decision have expanded upon these basic principles. For example, in an airport expansion case, the Florida Court of Appeals has stated that, the \"condemning authority need not present evidence pinpointing the need for the specific property, rather it is sufficient to show that the taking is necessary for the accomplishment of an overall plan of development. . . . Funds need not be on hand, nor do plans and specifications need be prepared for a condemnor to determine the necessity of a taking; in fact, it is the duty of public officials to look to the future and plan for the future. . . . Thus, there need not be an immediate need for the property sought to be taken.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Test v. Broward County, 616 So. 2d 111, 113 (Fla. App. 1993); cf. Alsip Park District v. D & M Partnership, 252 Ill. App. 3d 277, 286, 625 N.E.2d 40 (\"[A] condemning authority should `anticipate the future increased demands for the public use to which the land is to be devoted.' . . . The advance acquisition of parkland is practical in a society with a growing population and changing recreational needs.\" [Citation omitted.]), cert. denied, 152 Ill. 2d 553, 622 N.E.2d 1199 (1993); but see Phoenix v. McCullough, supra, 536 P.2d 237 (\"if the condemning body is uncertain when future use shall occur, the future use becomes unreasonable, speculative and remote as a matter of law and defeats the taking\").\n\nThe condemnor's right \"to acquire land for future expansion,\" however, is tempered by the need for \"a suitable investigation\" to inform its assessment of future needs. In re Pittsburgh School District Condemnation Case, 430 Pa. 566, 573-74, 244 A.2d 42 (1968). Indeed, the Pennsylvania court emphasized that the acquisition of land may not be \"for real estate speculation and future sale,\" but rather, must be, in the \"intelligent, informed judgment\" of the condemnor, in furtherance of \"an authorized public use . . . .\" Id., 574; see also Kansas City v. Hon, supra, 972 S.W.2d 415 (deferring to city's necessity conclusion that \"it needs to acquire the land now so that it can compete with other cities for the location of aviation-related facilities\").\n\nWith these principles, and the clearly erroneous standard of review, to guide our inquiry, we turn to the trial court's decision in the present case. We conclude that the trial court's determination that the parcel 3 takings were not impermissibly speculative was not clearly erroneous. Although the class A office building market was less than conducive to development and new construction at the time that the development plan was created, the trial court's deference to the legislative determination nevertheless was amply supported by the projections of future demand as a result of the new Pfizer facility. Numerous market studies were available and considered by the development corporation. Indeed, the trial court astutely observed that, at the time of the trial, the Pfizer facility had just opened; it, therefore, did not have the opportunity to create demand. Moreover, the report formulated by RKG Associates for the development plan predicted demand in the Fort Trumbull area by 2010, which is less than seven years away, which certainly is reasonably foreseeable temporally. Compare Adams v. Greenwich Water Co., supra, 138 Conn. 214 (ten year water demand projections acceptable for foreseeability), with Grand Rapids Board of Education v. Baczewski, supra, 340 Mich. 271-72 (taking unjustified when school board anticipated need for property thirty years after time of taking). In light of our previous conclusion that the trial court properly had found that the reasonable necessity determination was not the product of bad faith, unreasonableness, or an abuse of power, we also conclude that the trial court properly determined that the parcel 3 takings were not impermissibly speculative.\n\nThe plaintiffs rely on the holding in Phoenix v. McCullough, supra, 536 P.2d 237, in support of their contention that the parcel 3 takings are impermissibly speculative. Their reliance on McCullough is misplaced. We acknowledge that the Arizona court concluded that, \"if the condemning body is uncertain when future use shall occur, the future use becomes unreasonable, speculative and remote as a matter of law and defeats the taking.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In McCullough, the Arizona court arrived at that standard after applying a reasonableness standard to a fact pattern wherein the city sought to acquire the plaintiffs' property for airport expansion purposes, but did not have a reasonably accurate time line for that expansion; the city planners' estimates for the date of use varied from fifteen to forty-six years. Id., 236-37. Moreover, the city in McCullough had admitted that it did not have a specific plan for the use of the plaintiffs' properties within that expansive time frame. Id.\n\nWe conclude that the reasoning of McCullough is inapposite to the present case because it developed out of a vastly different set of facts. In contrast to the airport expansion plans in McCullough, the development plan in the present case contains carefully considered predictions of development and market growth, spurred by the opening of Pfizer's major facility. It also projects demand for space by 2010, which is less than ten years from now, and thus, presents a dramatically different time frame than the uncertain fifteen to forty-six year gap of McCullough.[89] We, therefore, conclude that the trial court did not commit clear error when it deferred to the legislative necessity determination and concluded that the parcel 3 takings were not impermissibly speculative.\n\nAccordingly, we further conclude that, because the trial court's decision regarding reasonable necessity was not the product of a legal error or an abuse of its discretion, we must uphold its denial of permanent injunctive relief to the plaintiffs with respect to those properties that are located on parcel 3. See Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 259 Conn. 598-99.V\n\nEQUAL PROTECTION CLAIMSThe plaintiffs next claim that the condemnation of the properties located on parcel 3 violated the equal protection clauses of the Connecticut[90] and United States[91] constitutions because the development corporation spared the Italian Dramatic Club (club) that also was located on that parcel. Specifically, they contend that the trial court improperly concluded that: (1) the club and the homes were not similarly situated; and (2) even if the club and the homes were similarly situated, the trial court utilized an improper legal standard by focusing on the defendants' subjective motivation in making the condemnation decision, rather than on whether the decision itself was arbitrary or irrational. The defendants claim, in response, that the trial court properly determined that the condemnations did not violate the equal protection clause of the federal constitution because: (1) the homes and the club are not similarly situated under the terms of the development plan or the relevant zoning laws; and (2) the development corporation's distinction between the two uses had a rational basis.[92] We agree with the defendants, and we conclude that the development corporation did not violate the plaintiffs' equal protection rights by condemning their properties, but not the club's building.\n\nThe trial court's memorandum of decision reveals the following additional facts relevant to our resolution of this claim. The club is a long-standing private social organization[93] in the Fort Trumbull area; its building is located on parcel 3 of the development plan. Originally, the club's building had been slated for acquisition and demolition in the development plan as approved by the city in January, 2000. In October, 2000, however, the development corporation determined that the club's building could remain on parcel 3.\n\nThe trial court concluded that the plaintiffs did not satisfy the \"preliminary step\" of establishing that they and the club were \"similarly situated\";[94] the court, therefore, concluded that it did not need to proceed further with the equal protection analysis. The trial court based this conclusion on the properties' locations within the parcel; it concluded that the club's building was on the border, while two of the plaintiffs' properties were within the interior and ultimately would lack roadway access. The trial court also cited the previously credited testimony of Hicks and Jones that retaining the residences would pose problems for the future development of the parcel, while the club's building would not.\n\nNevertheless, the trial court did not end its equal protection analysis with the similarly situated issue. It went on to assume hypothetically that the properties were similarly situated, and it addressed the plaintiffs' claim that their right to equal protection was violated because the development corporation's decision was the \"irrational\"[95] result of politically motivated favoritism toward the club. The court analyzed the record and testimony with respect to the development plan's process of creation and approval, and concluded that it was \"being asked to rely on speculation and conjecture by parties who . . . have the burden of proof.\"[96] The court, therefore, rejected the plaintiffs' equal protection claim.\n\n\"The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Thomas v. West Haven, 249 Conn. 385, 392, 734 A.2d 535 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1187, 120 S. Ct. 1239, 146 L. Ed. 2d 99 (2000). Thus, we ordinarily would have to address the plaintiffs' claim that the trial court improperly concluded, as a preliminary matter, that they were not similarly situated with the club's building. In light of the trial court's comprehensive memorandum of decision and the parties' thorough briefing, however, we will assume without deciding[97] that the plaintiffs' homes and the club are similarly situated for equal protection purposes.[98] Accordingly, we now will proceed to determine whether the trial court properly determined that the development corporation's decision had a rational basis and, therefore, did not violate the plaintiffs' equal protection rights. We conclude that the trial court correctly determined that there was a rational basis for the development corporation's condemnation decision.\n\nWhether the development corporation's action sparing the club's building, but not the plaintiffs' residences, from condemnation violated the equal protection clause \"must be gauged under the rational basis test. In the context of an equal protection challenge to social and economic legislation that does not infringe upon a fundamental right or affect a suspect group, the classification drawn by the statute will not violate the equal protection clause if it is rationally related to a legitimate public interest. Nordlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 8, 112 S. Ct. 2326, 120 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1992); Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439-41, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985). . . .\n\n\"The United States Supreme Court has recently summarized the rational basis test as applied to social and economic legislation that does not infringe upon a fundamental right or affect a suspect group. Nordlinger v. Hahn, supra, [505 U.S. 11-12]. In general, the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification, see United States Railroad Retirement Board v. Fritz, 449 U.S. 166, 174, 179 [101 S. Ct. 453, 66 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1980), reh. denied, 450 U.S. 960, 101 S. Ct. 1421, 67 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1981)], the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the government decisionmaker, see Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U.S. 456, 464 [101 S. Ct. 715, 66 L. Ed. 2d 659, reh. denied, 450 U.S. 1027, 101 S. Ct. 1735, 68 L. Ed. 2d 222] (1981), and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational, see Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., [supra, 473 U.S. 446]. Nordlinger v. Hahn, supra, [11]. . . .Therefore, the presumption of constitutionality can be overcome only by the most explicit demonstration that the classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes. The burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it. . . . Miller v. Heffernan, 173 Conn. 506, 509-10, 378 A.2d 572 (1977), appeal dismissed, 434 U.S. 1057, 98 S. Ct. 1226, 55 L. Ed. 2d 758 (1978). . . . Johnson v. Meehan, 225 Conn. 528, 535-37, 626 A.2d 244 (1993). Furthermore, when a court determines whether a legislative classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against a particular class, the challenger must establish that the legislature selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part because of, not merely in spite of, its adverse effects upon an identifiable group. Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279, 99 S. Ct. 2282, 60 L. Ed. 2d 870 (1979). (Citations omitted; emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) Stafford Higgins Industries, Inc. v. Norwalk, 245 Conn. 551, 567-69, 715 A.2d 46 (1998); accord City Recycling, Inc. v. State, 257 Conn. 429, 445-46, 778 A.2d 77 (2001).Armed with these well established principles, we now turn to whether the trial court properly concluded that the plaintiffs failed to prove that there was no conceivable rational basis for the development corporation's decision to spare the club's building, but not the plaintiffs' residential properties, from condemnation. At the outset, we note that the parties do not dispute that this is a pure question of law; accordingly, we will engage in plenary review of the trial court's conclusion.\n\nThe plaintiffs contend that in determining whether there was a rational basis for the development corporation's decision, the trial court utilized an improper legal standard by focusing on the defendants' subjective motivation in making the condemnation decision, rather than on whether the decision itself was arbitrary or irrational. The plaintiffs also contend that the \"defendants did not provide to the trial court a rational justification for its differential treatment between the property owners.\" The defendants claim, in response, that the plaintiffs have not carried their burden of proof, and that the decision to retain the club's building was rationally related to the achievement of the urban mixed-use community atmosphere of the development plan as a whole. We address each contention in turn.\n\nWe first address the plaintiffs' claim that the trial court applied an improper legal standard in its rational basis determination. Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that the trial court incorrectly had focused on the fact that they did not demonstrate adequately an improper or political motivation for the retention of the club's building, in violation of the United States Supreme Court's holding in Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 565, 120 S. Ct. 1073, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1060 (2000), as adopted by this court in City Recycling, Inc. v. State, supra, 257 Conn. 447. We disagree, and we conclude that the trial court did in fact apply the correct legal standard in evaluating the plaintiffs' claims.\n\nIn Willowbrook v. Olech, supra, 528 U.S. 564, the United States Supreme Court concluded that \"[o]ur cases have recognized successful equal protection claims brought by a class of one, where the plaintiff alleges that she has been intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated and that there is no rational basis for the difference in treatment. . . . In so doing, we have explained that [t]he purpose of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is to secure every person within the State's jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination, whether occasioned by express terms of a statute or by its improper execution through duly constituted agents.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) The court concluded that allegations of \"`irrational and wholly arbitrary'\" treatment by village officials \"quite apart from the [v]illage's subjective motivation, [were] sufficient to state a claim for relief under traditional equal protection analysis.\"[99] Id., 565.\n\nWe discussed the principles set forth in Willowbrook in City Recycling, Inc. v. State, supra, 257 Conn. 429. In that case, the commissioner of environmental protection (commissioner) had refused to process a recycling facility's application to expand its existing facility. Id., 431. The commissioner's refusal was pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-208a (a), as amended by No. 97-300, \u00a7 2, of the 1997 Public Acts (P.A. 97-300), which \"prohibit[ed] the commissioner . . . from approving, for a city with a population of greater than 100,000, the establishment or construction of `a new volume reduction plant or transfer station located, or proposed to be located, within one-quarter mile of a child day care center . . . .' The statute also excepts from its purview existing volume reduction facilities and transfer stations without regard to their location.\" City Recycling, Inc. v. State, supra, 431-32.\n\nAfter reviewing the extensive factual findings and the relevant legislative history, this court concluded in City Recycling, Inc., that \"[u]nder the principles of our equal protection jurisprudence, we conclude that P.A. 97-300, \u00a7 2, is unconstitutional as applied, because it is violative of the plaintiff's equal protection rights. The factual findings of the trial court negate any rational basis of which we can conceive, the most obvious of which is that the expansion of the plaintiff's facility would have some negative impact on children in the day care center located within one-quarter mile of the facility. The plaintiff's equal protection claim is particularly compelling in light of the legislative history of P.A. 97-300, \u00a7 2, which demonstrates that the legislation was aimed solely at the plaintiff's permit application.\" Id., 449.\n\nOur review of the trial court's memorandum of decision in the present case indicates that, as the plaintiffs claim, the court did in fact devote a great deal of analysis to the evidence of the process by which the decisions to condemn properties, and later to spare the club's building, were made. The memorandum states, however, that the court did so because the plaintiffs \"strenuously argued that the true and only motive of the decision to allow the [club] to remain while the same right was not extended to [the plaintiffs] was based not on any purpose to accomplish the [development plan's] goals, but to placate important political interests represented by the [club], its supporters and members.\" Our review indicates that the trial court's analysis and discussion of the decisional process supports its conclusion that the plaintiffs failed to carry their burden of proving that the development corporation acted arbitrarily or irrationally in making its decision to spare the club's building.\n\nMoreover, our review of the record, including the plaintiffs' trial briefs and the trial court's memorandum of decision, indicates that beyond claims of preferential treatment for the club, the plaintiffs failed to offer arguments in support of the determinative proposition that the development corporation's decision to spare the club completely lacked any conceivable rational basis. Indeed, the trial court expressly found that the club's social functions were related to the community and social aspects of the development plan, including the hotel. The court also found that, with respect to the goal of tying the development plan to other development in the downtown New London area, it \"cannot say [that] it is beyond the realm of rational consideration to want to have a social club of admittedly some political clout, with members and guests from outside the Fort Trumbull area, remain in that area.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs also claim that the \"defendants did not provide to the trial court a rational justification for its differential treatment between the property owners.\" The plaintiffs misstate the applicable burden of proof; indeed, as the trial court noted, they bear the burden of proving that there is no conceivable rational basis for the retention of the club's building. See, e.g., City Recycling, Inc. v. State, supra, 257 Conn. 446. Indeed, the plaintiffs' principal brief to this court discusses the applicable legal standard, but does not attempt to negative all conceivable reasons for keeping the club's building, but not their properties. Moreover, the city offers as a rational basis for the decision that the club's social functions are consistent with the social elements and community atmosphere of the development plan as a whole. Although the plaintiffs attack this determination in their reply brief as not worthy of being taken seriously, when engaging in analysis under the rational basis standard of review, we are constrained by the well established proposition, that \"the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification . . . the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the government decisionmaker . . . and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational . . . .\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 445. Thus, the rational basis proffered by the city, in combination with the plausible reasons found by the trial court, and the plaintiffs' failure to carry their high burden of proof, compel us to conclude that the plaintiffs' rights to the equal protection of the laws have not been violated by the development corporation's decision to retain the club's building, but not their properties.VI\n\nCROSS APPEAL: WHETHER THE TAKING OF PARCEL 4A WAS REASONABLY NECESSARYWe now turn to the defendants' cross appeal, wherein they contend, inter alia, that the trial court improperly concluded that the takings of the plaintiffs' properties on parcel 4A were not reasonably necessary and, therefore, improperly granted the plaintiffs permanent injunctive relief. Specifically, the defendants claim that the trial court's conclusion that the properties on parcel 4A were not reasonably necessary because proposals, but no definite plan, were yet in place for the use of that parcel, was the product of an improperly broad review that did not afford the appropriate deference to the legislative necessity determination. The development corporation also contends that the trial court incorrectly allocated the burden of proof to the defendants. The plaintiffs contend, in response, that the trial court: (1) utilized the correct legal standard in its inquiry; and (2) correctly concluded that the properties on parcel 4A were not reasonably necessary because, unlike with parcel 3, the trial court did not have sufficient information before it to pass on the necessity of those properties to the development as a result of the lack of plans for parcel 4 development. We agree with the defendants, and we conclude that the trial court did not utilize the correct legal standard in evaluating the plaintiffs' parcel 4A claims and, therefore, improperly granted the plaintiffs permanent injunctive relief.\n\nWe begin by setting forth the standard of review applicable to a legislative or agency determination of reasonable necessity. As an initial matter, the question of \"[w]hether the purpose for which a statute authorizes the condemnation of property constitutes a public use is, in the end, a judicial question to be resolved by the courts . . . but, in resolving it, great weight must be given to the determination of the legislature.\" (Citation omitted.) Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 141. In part II of this opinion, we concluded that economic development projects created and implemented pursuant to chapter 132 of the General Statutes that have the public economic benefits of creating new jobs, increasing tax and other revenues, and contributing to urban revitalization, namely, the development plan in the present case, satisfy the public use clauses of the federal and state constitutions.\n\nOnce this court concludes that the enabling statutes support a public purpose, however, our review becomes much more limited in scope. \"The determination of what property is necessary to be taken in any given case in order to effectuate the public purpose is, under our constitution, a matter for the exercise of the legislative power. When the legislature delegates the making of that determination to another agency, the decision of that agency is conclusive. . . . The agency's decision, however, is open to judicial review only to discover if it was unreasonable or in bad faith or was an abuse of the power conferred.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 259 Conn. 600; Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 146; accord Adams v. Greenwich Water Co., supra, 138 Conn. 213-14; Bugryn v. Bristol, supra, 63 Conn. App. 107-108. Moreover, under this standard it is \"the plaintiff [who has] the burden of establishing that the taking . . . was unreasonable, in bad faith or an abuse of power.\" (Emphasis added.) Hall v. Weston, supra, 167 Conn. 66; accord Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 598; Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 146.\n\nAs stated in part IV A of this opinion, on appeal this court will apply the clearly erroneous standard of review to the trial court's underlying factual determination of whether the legislative or agency determination of necessity \"`was unreasonable or in bad faith or was an abuse of the power conferred.' Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 146.\" Bugryn v. Bristol, supra, 63 Conn. App. 107. It is well established that \"[a] finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) DiMartino v. Richens, supra, 263 Conn. 661.\n\nFurthermore, \"[t]he governing principles for our standard of review as it pertains to a trial court's discretion to grant or deny a request for an injunction [are]: A party seeking injunctive relief has the burden of alleging and proving irreparable harm and lack of an adequate remedy at law. . . . A prayer for injunctive relief is addressed to the sound discretion of the court and the court's ruling can be reviewed only for the purpose of determining whether the decision was based on an erroneous statement of law or an abuse of discretion. . . . Therefore, unless the trial court has abused its discretion, or failed to exercise its discretion . . . the trial court's decision must stand.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 259 Conn. 598.\n\nThe record reveals the following additional facts relevant to our resolution of this claim. As mentioned previously in this opinion, parcel 4 is subdivided into two smaller parcels, 4A and 4B. Eleven properties owned by four of the plaintiffs are located on parcel 4A; they occupy 0.76 acres out of the 2.4 acre parcel. Under the development plan, parcel 4A is designated for \"park support\" or \"marina support . . . .\" There is no development commitment or formal site plan in place for parcel 4A.\n\nAlthough the development plan does not define the term \"park support\" expressly,[100] in describing the parcel's intended use, it states that \"[a] portion of [p]arcel 4A will be redeveloped for uses that support the state park, such as parking, or for uses such as retail that will serve park visitors and members of the community.\" As the trial court correctly noted, the development plan later describes an alternative use for parcel 4A, which is \"the development of support facilities for a marina, or a marina training facility, to be developed to the south on [p]arcel 4B and the Fort Trumbull State Park to the east. Any development of ancillary buildings that may be located on these two parcels shall be oriented to help define their edges . . . . Surface parking developed on either of these parcels shall be appropriately screened.\"[101]\n\nClaire Gaudiani, president of the development corporation, testified that the development corporation also was working with the United States Coast Guard to explore the possibility of placing its museum on parcel 4A.[102] The development corporation has not, however, obtained a commitment from the Coast Guard for museum development on parcel 4A, because the Coast Guard was still choosing sites; indeed, the museum also had been considered for parcel 2, as well. Gaudiani testified that, to her personal knowledge, parcel 4A was the \"preferred\" and more likely site for the museum.[103]\n\nThe trial court began its analysis with the proposition that, \"it is not necessary that the officials proceed to make immediate use of the property thus acquired, or that they have `plans and specifications prepared and all other preparations necessary for immediate construction before it [the county] can determine the necessity for taking private property for public purpose.' Carlor Co. v. Miami, 62 So. 2d 897, 902 (Emphasis added.) (Fla. 1953)].\" Wright v. Dade County, 216 So. 2d 494, 496 (Fla. App. 1968), cert. denied, 225 So. 2d 527 (Fla. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1008, 90 S. Ct. 565, 24 L. Ed. 2d 500 (1970). The trial court then stated that when the Florida court applied this proposition in Miami Beach v. Broida, 362 So. 2d 19, 20 (Fla. App. 1978), cert. denied, 372 So. 2d 466 (Fla. 1979), it had noted that there was a partially completed plan in place that justified taking the condemnees' property for a convention center. The trial court then cited State Highway Commission v. Yost Farm Co., 142 Mont. 239, 243-44, 384 P.2d 277 (1963), and Krauter v. Lower Big Blue Natural Resources District, 199 Neb. 431, 439, 259 N.W.2d 472 (1977),[104] for the proposition that the \"[condemnor] must in the first instance produce sufficient evidence to establish facts indicating the taking is necessary.\"\n\nThe trial court then stated that, under these standards, the statements in the development plan regarding parcel 4A are \"too vague and uncertain to allow [it] to conclude [that] the takings here are necessary and would not be reasonable.\" It concluded that the hopes of placing the museum on the parcel were too speculative to justify the condemnations, and that the other plans were too vague to allow it to engage in a necessity analysis; in other words, \"[e]ven if the court were prepared to give the legislative agency all the deference in the world under these circumstances . . . the court just cannot make the requisite constitutionally required necessity determination based on the information before it.\" On the basis of this conclusion, the court granted permanent injunctive relief against the demolition of the plaintiffs' properties located on parcel 4A, and ordered that the statements of compensation and certificates of taking with respect to those properties be dismissed.\n\nOn the basis of our review of the record and the trial court's memorandum of decision, we conclude that the trial court's review of the parcel 4A taking utilized a legal standard that permitted review far in excess of that provided for by our well established case law. More specifically, although the trial court did acknowledge nominally the judicial deference owed to the legislative necessity determination, our review of its analysis, particularly the inclusion of the Montana and Nebraska cases, indicates that it did not utilize the proper legal standard, as set forth in Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 259 Conn. 598-601, and Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 146, in reviewing the parcel 4A takings.\n\nThe trial court cited State Highway Commission v. Yost Farm Co., supra, 142 Mont. 243-44, and Krauter v. Lower Big Blue Natural Resources District, supra, 199 Neb. 439, for the proposition that the \"[condemnor] must in the first instance produce sufficient evidence to establish facts indicating the taking is necessary.\" As the development corporation correctly contends, this proposition improperly interposes burdens of production and persuasion that are dramatically different than the burden our state applies in cases wherein the necessity of a taking is attacked. In Connecticut it is not the condemnor, but rather \"the plaintiff [who has] the burden of establishing that the taking . . . was unreasonable, in bad faith or an abuse of power.\" (Emphasis added.) Hall v. Weston, supra, 167 Conn. 66; accord Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 259 Conn. 598; Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 146.\n\nWe note further that the Montana and Nebraska decisions followed by the trial court utilize an approach to the necessity determination that is dramatically different from the deferential standard that our state applies in cases wherein the necessity of a taking is attacked. Unlike Connecticut, these courts consider necessity to be a question of fact for the judiciary. For example, in State Highway Commission v. Yost Farm Co., supra, 142 Mont. 243-44, the court stated: \"The foregoing statutes and cases clearly reflect that under [Montana's] eminent domain statutory provisions, the trial judge not only has the power to determine the question of necessity, but has been directed to make a finding that the public interest requires the taking of the lands before he has power to issue an order of condemnation.\"[105] In Connecticut, to the contrary, a trial court is limited to the factual determination of whether the legislative or agency determination of necessity \"was unreasonable or in bad faith or was an abuse of the power conferred.\" Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 146. Despite acknowledging this deferential standard of review, and properly applying it in its review of the necessity of the taking of parcel 3 properties, the trial court improperly conducted a necessity review that went beyond the scope of review permitted and based its decision to grant permanent injunctive relief on an incorrect statement of the law with respect to the parcel 4A properties.[106] Accordingly, its decision to grant permanent injunctive relief to those plaintiffs who own property located on parcel 4A was an abuse of its discretion.[107]\n\nFurthermore, we note that the plaintiffs claim only that the trial court properly determined that the taking of parcel 4A was not reasonably necessary. As previously discussed, this argument is premised on the trial court applying a standard of review that is not applicable in Connecticut. The plaintiffs did not claim that the development corporation's decision violated the proper standard utilized in Connecticut for reviewing such decisions\u2014whether the decision was \"unreasonable or in bad faith or was an abuse of the power conferred.\" Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 146. In reviewing the plaintiffs' parcel 3 claim, we affirmed the trial court's determination that \"there is no evidence, credible or otherwise, that the condemnations in parcel 3 as originally envisaged in the [development plan] or at the time of the taking were done in bad faith, or not with an honest motive, or based on [any] pretext given any reasonable definition of the word . . . .\" See part IV A of this opinion. Similarly, our review of the record as it concerns the development corporation's necessity determination for parcel 4A reveals that it was not the product of bad faith, unreasonableness, or an abuse of the power conferred. Compare AvalonBay Communities, Inc. v. Orange, supra, 256 Conn. 565, 579-80 (municipality's project plan was \"pretext . . . to thwart affordable housing\"; \"the record fully support[ed] the trial court's finding that the [chapter 132] project plan was hastily assembled, poorly envisioned and incomplete\").\n\nWhile there was no development commitment or formal site plan in place for parcel 4A, this is not necessarily indicative of bad faith, unreasonableness or abuse of power. As the trial court stated, \"master planning is a process that evolves over time and must be flexible and subject to change as conditions warrant.\"[108] Similarly, this court has rejected a challenge to a town's condemnation based upon the town's lack of a detailed plan designating exactly what part of the defendants' land it needed for what purpose. West Hartford v. Talcott, 138 Conn. 82, 91, 82 A.2d 351 (1951); cf. American Trading Real Estate Properties, Inc. v. Trumbull, 215 Conn. 68, 79, 574 A.2d 796 (1990) (\"land is indeed held for public use even when a municipality is not presently making use of the land but is simply holding it for development at some later time\"). Furthermore, the development plan reveals that intended uses of parcel 4A include parking for a state park, or retail that will serve visitors and members of the community, or support facilities for a marina or a marina training facility. These intended uses, while not subject to definite commitments, do demonstrate that the development corporation has given reasonable attention and thought to the potential use of parcel 4A. Accordingly, under our deferential standard of review, the record does not support a finding that the development corporation acted in bad faith, unreasonably or in abuse of its power when it decided that parcel 4A was necessary to accomplish the objectives of the development plan. See Berman v. Parker, supra, 348 U.S. 35-36 (\"It is not for the courts to oversee the choice of the boundary line nor to sit in review on the size of a particular project area. Once the question of the public purpose has been decided, the amount and character of land to be taken for the project and the need for a particular tract to complete the integrated plan rests in the discretion of the legislative branch.\"); Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 146 (necessity determination open to judicial review only to discover if it was \"unreasonable or in bad faith or was an abuse of the power conferred\").\n\nThe judgment is affirmed with respect to the parcel 3 takings; the judgment is reversed with respect to the parcel 4A takings, and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment for the defendants.In this opinion BORDEN, PALMER and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.\n\nZARELLA, J., with whom SULLIVAN, C. J., and KATZ, J., join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.Another court observed in a different context: \"A man's home may be his castle, but that does not keep the Government from taking it.\" Hendler v. United States, 952 F.2d 1364, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 1991). That is because, \"[a]s an incident to its sovereignty, the Government has the authority to take private property for a public purpose.\"[1] Id. At the time that our federal constitution was written, a government taking meant just that, namely, a taking for a government purpose such as for a public building. Id. As the population grew and the collective needs of our society changed, however, the takings power was construed more broadly. Governmental authorities condemned private properties not just for a \"public use,\" but also to achieve a \"public benefit\" such as the elimination of urban blight. Today, an even more expansive interpretation of public use in certain jurisdictions permits the taking of property for private economic development. To many, this represents a sea change in the evolution of the law of takings because it blurs the distinction between public purpose and private benefit and cannot help but raise the specter that the power will be used to favor purely private interests. This case therefore presents the court with a rare and timely opportunity to address a constitutional issue of great significance, that is, whether there are limits to the government's authority to take private property by eminent domain when the public purpose is private economic development, and, if so, how those limits should be defined and enforced.\n\nI believe that the majority reaches the wrong result with respect to the plaintiffs' properties, in part because it overlooks the fact that private economic development differs in many important respects from how we have defined a public use in the past. Accordingly, although I concur in parts I,[2] III and V[3] of the majority opinion regarding the applicability of chapter 132 of the General Statutes[4] to nonvacant land, the constitutionality of delegating the eminent domain power to the New London Development Corporation (development corporation), and the plaintiffs' equal protection claims, respectively, I disagree with the majority's conclusions in parts II, IV and VI pertaining to private economic development[5] as a public use under the Connecticut and federal constitutions and the taking of the plaintiffs' properties on parcels 3 and 4A.\n\nI begin by noting that, because this is a case of first impression, this court has not considered, prior to today, many of the issues raised by the parties to this appeal, including whether chapter 132 of the General Statutes is constitutional. I further note that this court has not examined, for nearly a century, the authority of the state to exercise its power of eminent domain for the public benefit when accompanied by a corresponding benefit to private interests.[6] See Connecticut College v. Calvert, 87 Conn. 421, 424-28, 88 A. 633 (1913); Evergreen Cemetery Assn. v. Beecher, 53 Conn. 551, 553, 5 A. 353 (1886). Thus, it is important to undertake a review of property rights, the eminent domain power and the evolution of the public use requirement before addressing the issues raised by the plaintiffs in this appeal.\n\nPart I A of this dissent briefly explores, from a historical standpoint, both the nature of the sovereign's taking authority and the development of the concept of private property rights. Part I B examines the historical development of the takings clauses of the state and federal constitutions, with particular emphasis on the changing concept of public use.\n\nPart II examines the degree of deference due to the legislature in its determination of what constitutes a public use, as well as the appropriate role of the court in ensuring that the condemnees' constitutional rights under the state and federal constitutions are not infringed. This part of the opinion also addresses whether different levels of judicial review are required depending on the nature of the public use under consideration.\n\nPart III applies the principles enunciated in part II to the specific facts of this case as found by the trial court. Part IV summarizes my concerns, expressed throughout this opinion, as to the use of the eminent domain power in furtherance of private economic development.\n\nIn summary, I conclude that the legislature should be accorded great deference in determining what constitutes a public use, that the courts have a limited role in reviewing that determination, that chapter 132 of the General Statutes is facially constitutional, that, as the category of public use changes from one of direct public use to indirect public benefit in the form of private economic development, the level of judicial inquiry must increase in order to protect the legitimate interests of the condemnee, and, finally, that the taking of homes on parcels 3 and 4A, as described in the development plan, was not warranted on the basis of the facts found by the trial court and the principles set forth in this opinion.I\n\nHISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS, EMINENT DOMAIN AND THE PUBLIC USE CLAUSEAPrivate Property Rights and Eminent DomainI agree with this court's observation that \"[a] public use defies absolute definition, for it changes with varying conditions of society, new appliances in the sciences, changing conceptions of the scope and functions of government, and other differing circumstances brought about by an increase in population and new modes of communication and transportation.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Katz v. Brandon, 156 Conn. 521, 532, 245 A.2d 579 (1968). I also recognize that the concept of public use has evolved over the course of our nation's history from the taking of private property for actual use by the public to the taking of property to further the public good or to secure some public benefit. See 2A P. Nichols, Eminent Domain (3d Ed. Rev. 2003, J. Sackman ed.) \u00a7 7.01[1], p. 7-16. I believe, however, that when this court is called upon to decide claims arising under chapter 132 of the General Statutes, it must be ever mindful, not only of a sovereign's historical power to acquire private property for a public use, but also of our nation's long-held commitment, shared by this state, to protect private property from unnecessary takings. See J. Lazzarotti, \"Public Use or Public Abuse,\" 68 UMKC L. Rev. 49, 55 (1999); see also Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, 259 Conn. 592, 601, 790 A.2d 1178 (2002) (authority to condemn strictly construed against taking party).\n\nPrivate property rights developed as a legal concept in Europe during the demise of feudalism. See J. Lazzarotti, supra, 68 UMKC L. Rev. 53. The Magna Carta recognized the necessity of protecting private property rights in 1225 in providing that \"[n]o Freeman shall be . . . desseised of his Freehold . . . but by lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.\" Magna Carta, c. XXIX (1225). The text of our federal constitution reflects a similar intent that private property rights be fully protected. See, e.g., U.S. Const., amends. V and XIV. The idea that the protection of private property is a principal aim of our society was affirmed by former United States Representative John A. Bingham, drafter of the fourth amendment, when he declared that \"natural or inherent rights, which belong to all men irrespective of all conventional regulations, are by this constitution guarantied by the broad and comprehensive word `person' . . . guarding those sacred rights which are as universal and indestructible as the human race, that `no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property but by due process of law, nor shall private property be taken without just compensation.'\" Cong. Globe, 35th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 983 (1859). Bingham also declared that \"the absolute equality of all, and the equal protection of each, are principles of our Constitution . . . . It protects not only life and liberty, but also property, the product of labor.\" Cong. Globe, 34th Cong., 3d Sess., App., p. 140 (1857). In Connecticut, private property rights were so firmly entrenched by the time of the state constitutional convention in 1818 that the takings clause of the new constitution, which provided that \"[t]he property of no person shall be taken for public use without just compensation therefor\"; Conn. Const. (1818), art. I, \u00a7 11; was adopted without debate. W. Horton, The Connecticut State Constitution: A Reference Guide (1993) p. 70.\n\nNevertheless, the right of the sovereign to condemn private property also has deep historical roots, purportedly dating back to the Romans. L. Berger, \"The Public Use Requirement in Eminent Domain,\" 57 Or. L. Rev. 203, 204 (1978). The term \"eminent domain\" was used in the seventeenth century work, De Jure Belli et Pacis, in which Hugo Grotius, a renowned legal scholar, discussed the government's authority \"to take private property for reasons of extreme necessity or public utility upon payment of compensation.\" Id. In our own country, the taking of private property for a public use was a well accepted principle in colonial times. 2A P. Nichols, supra, \u00a7 7.01[3], p. 7-17. Eminent domain was employed to support mills, to create roads, to build canals and bridges; id., \u00a7 7.07[3], p. 7-200.1; and to drain private lands. Id., \u00a7 7.01[3], p. 7-17. As the power was used more frequently, however, controversy ensued. Id., pp. 7-17 through 7-18. Beginning with Pennsylvania and Vermont, in 1776 and 1777, states sought in their early constitutions to place specific limitations on the power of eminent domain. Id., p. 7-18. Since that time, courts have sought, and sometimes struggled, to interpret the public use clause in light of state regulations and changes in the nation's economy that have transformed our society in unforeseen ways.BEvolution of the Public Use RequirementA review of the law on takings reveals that the definition of \"public use,\" when considered in the context of the eminent domain power, has no precise or fixed meaning. Id., \u00a7 7.02[1], p. 7-24. Some courts have narrowly construed the public use clause to mean that property acquired by eminent domain actually must be used by the public, or that the public must have the opportunity to use the acquired property. Id., \u00a7 7.02[2], p. 7-26; see, e.g., Rockingham County Light & Power Co. v. Hobbs, 72 N.H. 531, 534, 58 A. 46 (1904). Under a narrow reading of the term, public use includes public buildings, utilities, schools and roads. Pocantico Water-Works Co. v. Bird, 130 N.Y. 249, 259, 29 N.E. 246 (1891); 2A P. Nichols, supra, \u00a7 7.02[6], p. 7-36.1.\n\nOther courts have construed the public use clause more broadly to include a use that furthers the public good or the general welfare, or one that secures some public benefit. 2A P. Nichols, supra, \u00a7 7.01[1], pp. 7-15 through 7-16; see id., \u00a7 7.02[3], p. 7-29; see also Olmstead v. Camp, 33 Conn. 532, 546 (1866) (\"`[p]ublic use' may . . . mean public usefulness, utility or advantage, or what is productive of general benefit\"). Under this more expansive interpretation of the term, the United States Supreme Court has held that the scope of eminent domain is \"coterminous with the scope of a sovereign's police powers.\"[7] Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 240, 104 S. Ct. 2321, 81 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1984). Historically, the most dramatic example of takings under a broad construction of the public use clause is the acquisition of property for the redevelopment of blighted areas, whereby the stated public purpose is to reduce the menace to the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the community by \"eliminating substandard, insanitary, deteriorated, deteriorating, slum or blighted conditions . . . [and] preventing recurrence of such conditions in the area . . . .\" General Statutes \u00a7 8-124.\n\nPrivate economic development pursuant to chapter 132 of the General Statutes can be distinguished in at least two important respects from previous notions of public use. First, traditional takings almost always are followed by an immediate or reasonably foreseeable public benefit. See, e.g., Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, 141 Conn. 135, 138-39, 104 A.2d 365 (1954) (condemnation of properties followed soon thereafter by relocation of project area residents and demolition of substandard structures); Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 551 (land taken by flooding contemporaneously with continuous operation of grist mill). In contrast, large-scale, private economic development projects authorized under chapter 132 of the General Statutes may not be completed for decades. In the present case, the municipal development plan (development plan), by its own terms, will be in full force and effect for a period of thirty years.[8] Accordingly, there may be much more uncertainty as to when and how the public may benefit when property is condemned for private economic development.\n\nSecond, the public benefit derived from a conventional taking typically flows from the actions of the taking party. See, e.g., Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra, 467 U.S. 229 (public benefit achieved as result of housing authority's transfer of title from lessors to lessees); Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 142 (public benefit achieved by redevelopment agency's elimination of substandard structures and other evidence of blight on condemned properties); Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 551 (public benefit achieved by private property owner's operation of grist mill). In contrast, takings for private economic development require the taking party to transfer ownership of the condemned land to private developers who subsequently execute a plan to accomplish the public purpose. Because public agencies must work hand in glove with private developers to achieve plan objectives, the taking agency may employ the power to favor purely private interests. See, e.g., Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental, LLC, 199 Ill. 2d 225, 240-41, 768 N.E.2d 1 (taking of property for expansion of private parking facility deemed not for public purpose), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 880, 123 S. Ct. 88, 154 L. Ed. 2d 135 (2002). The trial court in the present case recognized this problem when it stated in its memorandum of decision that \"powerful business groups or companies [may] exercise their influence to gain their ends with . . . little corresponding benefit to the public.\" The majority makes a similar observation. See part II A of the majority opinion (recognizing \"potential for abuse of the eminent domain power\").\n\nA direct comparison of the statutory provisions on redevelopment and the corresponding provisions pertaining to private economic development illustrates the unique constitutional problem that may arise when the taking of private property for a public purpose also bestows significant benefits on private developers. Under chapter 130 of the General Statutes,[9] the redevelopment scheme, an area in need of revitalization is identified, properties are acquired, structures are demolished as necessary to eliminate blighted conditions and site improvements are made prior to the disposition of the cleared and improved land. See generally General Statutes \u00a7 8-124 et seq. The declaration of public policy contained in chapter 130 expressly provides that the disposition of property is \"incidental to\" the elimination of blight and the activities surrounding the elimination of blight enumerated in the statute,[10] which are \"public uses and purposes for which public money may be expended and the power of eminent domain exercised . . . .\" General Statutes \u00a7 8-124. Consequently, the public benefit in a redevelopment project is clearly defined and well understood. It also can be accomplished relatively quickly and with a high degree of certainty because a public agency, funded with public money, is charged with bringing it about.\n\nIn contrast, municipal development projects undertaken pursuant to chapter 132 of the General Statutes involve the expenditure of funds to acquire and to improve land, water and vacated commercial plants for the far more abstract and ill-defined goals of promoting the \"continued growth of industry and business within the state\" and \"meet[ing] the needs of industry and business . . . .\"[11] General Statutes \u00a7 8-186. The statutory scheme contains no clear description of how those goals are to be accomplished, except by conveyance of the properties to private parties. Disposition of the properties is thus essential, rather than incidental, to achieving the public purpose. Although the properties, once conveyed, are subject to land use restrictions and, in some cases, oversight by state agencies, there is no statutory assurance that the public will benefit from the development to follow or that the development even will occur. As the trial court observed, \"[t]he very nature of economic development-type projects is such that their accomplishment [is] based on financial predictions and possibilities that cannot be certain and [is] dependent on equally uncertain competitive factors.\"\n\nThe underlying uncertainty as to whether the public benefit will be achieved as planned in private economic development projects is expressly recognized in General Statutes \u00a7 8-200 (b). That statute provides that a development plan may be abandoned within three years of its approval, and that any properties acquired thereunder may be conveyed free of the plan's restrictions if they cannot be conveyed to a private party at fair market value pursuant to the plan.[12] General Statutes \u00a7 8-200 (b). The statutory scheme dealing with redevelopment contains no similar provision, and need not, because the public purpose of eliminating blight is accomplished at the time of the taking. Whatever occurs thereafter is irrelevant to the takings issue. Accordingly, under chapter 132 of the General Statutes, the possibility that a project may be abandoned after properties have been taken by eminent domain, when combined with the inherent uncertainty that the expected public benefit will be achieved in any particular case, raises serious concerns regarding the limits of the takings power that cannot be ignored.\n\nRecent developments in the law of certain jurisdictions that permit condemnations for private economic development have caused one commentator to remark that most observers believe that the public use limitation on the power of eminent domain is a \"dead letter.\" T. Merrill, \"The Economics of Public Use,\" 72 Cornell L. Rev. 61, 61 (1986). Critics question the propriety of condemning private property merely because a newly proposed use promises a greater public benefit than an existing use. See, e.g., Poletown Neighborhood Council v. Detroit, 410 Mich. 616, 647, 676, 304 N.W.2d 455 (1981) (Ryan, J., dissenting). They note that \"[a]ny business enterprise produces benefits to society at large,\" and, consequently, \"there is virtually no limit to the use of condemnation to aid private businesses.\" Id., 644 (Fitzgerald, J., dissenting). Thus, it is not surprising, as the majority concedes, that many \"express alarm at what they consider to be a situation rife with the potential for abuse of the eminent domain power.\" Part II A of the majority opinion. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court acknowledged the danger of rendering the takings clauses of the federal and state constitutions meaningless and ignoring the private values of home and property \"by allowing free rein to expanding capital markets.\" Ironically, the controversy has developed notwithstanding the existence of well established law advising that \"[t]he authority to condemn is to be strictly construed in favor of the owner and against the condemnor.\" Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 259 Conn. 601; accord State v. McCook, 109 Conn. 621, 630, 147 A. 126 (1929); see also 3 P. Nichols, supra, \u00a7 9.02[3], pp. 9-19 through 9-20.\n\nGrowing fears regarding the potential abuse of the eminent domain power cannot be dismissed as idle speculation on the part of commentators. As municipalities increasingly struggle to provide public services with limited financial resources, governmental authorities are encouraging more intensive economic development to generate additional tax revenue, to create new jobs and to jump start local economies. Accordingly, there is a gathering storm of public debate as to whether the use of eminent domain to acquire property for private economic development in nonblighted areas is justified. I believe that such debate is essential to clarify the role of the legislature in making determinations of public use and the corresponding role of the courts in safeguarding the rights of private property owners who fear that the takings power will be used solely to benefit private interests. The complementary roles of the legislature and the judiciary as interpreters and guardians of the takings power thus require further examination.II\n\nJUDICIAL DEFERENCE TO LEGISLATIVE DETERMINATIONS OF PUBLIC USEADeterminations by State LegislaturesThe suggestion frequently is made that courts have abdicated their role as interpreter of the law by showing unusual deference to legislative determinations of public use. See, e.g., S. Jones, Note, \"Trumping Eminent Domain Law: An Argument for Strict Scrutiny Analysis Under the Public Use Requirement of the Fifth Amendment,\" 50 Syracuse L. Rev. 286, 301 (2000). Proper consideration of the issue, however, requires that a distinction be made between public use determinations by state legislative bodies and determinations by local public authorities that specific properties should be condemned.\n\nIt is well established that judicial deference to determinations of public use by state legislatures is appropriate. E.g., Berman v. Parker, 348 U.S. 26, 32, 75 S. Ct. 98, 99 L. Ed. 27 (1954) (\"[s]ubject to specific constitutional limitations, when the legislature has spoken, the public interest has been declared in terms well-nigh conclusive\"); see Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra, 467 U.S. 241. The logic behind this principle is that the power to take property is a function of the \"principle of consent inherent in a representative government.\" M. Harrington, \" `Public Use' and the Original Understanding of the So-Called `Takings' Clause,\" 53 Hastings L.J. 1245, 1247 (2002). \"[L]egislatures are better able to assess what public purposes should be advanced by an exercise of the taking power.\" Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra, 244.\n\nNevertheless, judicial deference to legislative declarations of public use does not require complete abdication of judicial responsibility. Id., 240 (\"There is . . . a role for courts to play in reviewing a legislature's judgment of what constitutes a public use . . . . But . . . it is an extremely narrow one.\" [Internal quotation marks omitted.]); Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 551 (\"[t]he sole dependence must be on the presumed wisdom of the sovereign authority, supervised, and in cases of gross error or extreme wrong, controlled, by the dispassionate judgment of the courts\"). In fact, the last Connecticut case to address the issue recognized that the question of \"[w]hether the purpose for which a statute authorizes the condemnation of property constitutes a public use is, in the end, a judicial question to be resolved by the courts . . . but, in resolving it, great weight must be given to the determination of the legislature.\" (Citation omitted.) Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 141. Accordingly, I agree with the majority that judicial deference to determinations of public use by state legislative bodies is appropriate, but emphasize that the courts are empowered to resolve disputes when such determinations are challenged.BDeterminations by Local Public AgenciesThe majority notes, with respect to the decisions of local public authorities regarding specific condemnations, that \"[t]he determination of what property is necessary to be taken in any given case in order to effectuate the public purpose is, under our constitution, a matter for the exercise of the legislative power.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Part IV A of the majority opinion; accord Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 146. The majority further notes that Connecticut courts typically defer to the legislative determination of necessity and limit their review to whether the decision of the taking agency was unreasonable, had been made in bad faith or constituted an abuse of power. See part IV A of the majority opinion; see also Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 146; Adams v. Greenwich Water Co., 138 Conn. 205, 213-14, 83 A.2d 177 (1951); Water Commissioners v. Johnson, 86 Conn. 151, 159, 84 A. 727 (1912).\n\nFor example, when a local legislative body determines that a new road is required, the court must defer to the local determination as to where the prospective road should be located and which properties should be taken to accomplish that purpose. In the absence of unreasonableness, fraud, or abuse of power, the determination regarding the location of the prospective road falls within the discretion of the local legislative body. The fact that there may be another possible road location that would accomplish the same objective will not avail a property owner who seeks to challenge the taking because local legislative determinations concerning what constitutes a public use and what properties need to be taken to effectuate that use are entitled to judicial deference. I agree with the majority with respect to these principles.\n\nWhere I part company from the majority is on the issue of whether the actual use to be implemented will serve the public purpose described in the development plan at issue in the present case. The trial court and the majority frame the issue as whether there are reasonable assurances of a future public use. They treat the matter as one of control over development of the property following its disposition and focus on the statutory and contractual constraints in place to ensure that private sector participants will adhere to the provisions of the development plan. The majority concludes that the terms of the development plan regarding parcel-specific uses and continuing state oversight during the development process will provide sufficient assurances that the properties will be developed in accordance with the plan's objectives.\n\nI submit that such an analysis must focus not only on the possible statutory, contractual and planning constraints that would ensure a public use, but also on the temporal question of whether there is any reasonable prospect that the expected development will, in fact, occur. Moreover, in determining whether the actual use to be implemented will serve a public purpose, I would follow the standard established in two earlier cases and grant no deference to the legislative authority because such a determination lies within the province of the trial court. See, e.g., Connecticut College v. Calvert, supra, 87 Conn. 428.\n\nIn Connecticut College, this court \"accept[ed] and endors[ed] the legislative declaration that the higher education of women is in its nature a public use\" for which the eminent domain power may be exercised. Id. The court reserved for itself, however, the authority to resolve questions regarding the implementation of the claimed public use in any specific case. See id., 423-24, 428. \"It is for the legislature to say whether any given use is governmental in its nature or not, subject to review by the courts only in exceptional cases of extreme wrong . . . . But the question whether in any given instance the use is or will be administered as a public or as a private use, is a question which must of necessity be determined by the courts in accordance with the facts of the particular case in hand.\" (Emphasis added.) Id., 428.\n\nIn making the foregoing distinction, the court relied on Evergreen Cemetery Assn. v. Beecher, supra, 53 Conn. 551, in which the court sustained a demurrer to a petition for the appointment of appraisers in condemnation proceedings brought under state law concerning the taking of property for the establishment of cemeteries. Id., 552-53; see Connecticut College v. Calvert, supra, 87 Conn. 428-29. The court in Connecticut College noted: \"[I]n the course of its opinion [the court in Evergreen Cemetery Assn.] pointed out that although the establishment of cemeteries was a use which was public in its nature . . . the petition was insufficient because it did not appear that the petitioner's cemetery was one in which the public had or could acquire the right to bury their dead . . . .\" Connecticut College v. Calvert, supra, 429; see Evergreen Cemetery Assn. v. Beecher, supra, 553. That precedent, which the majority, sub silentio, overrules today, stands for the proposition that a trial court charged with determining whether the actual use of the property taken will in fact be for a public or private purpose need not defer to the views of the local legislative body.[13] See Connecticut College v. Calvert, supra, 428.\n\nConnecticut is not alone in concluding that courts may inquire into the actual purpose for which property is to be condemned, even when it is claimed that the condemnation is for a public purpose. See 27 Am. Jur. 2d 112-13, Eminent Domain \u00a7 555 (1996). In State ex rel. Tacoma Industrial Co. v. White River Power Co., 39 Wash. 648, 82 P. 150 (1905), the respondent power company was authorized to build and operate water-generated power plants that supply electricity to, inter alia, public users in designated cities in the state of Washington. Id., 661. The power company filed a petition seeking to condemn certain private property. Id. At a preliminary hearing on the matter, the lower court found that the proposed use was public in nature and ordered a jury impaneled to assess the damages owed to the property owners. Id. In reviewing the lower court's order, the Washington Supreme Court concluded that \"the grounds of public benefit upon which the taking is proposed are vague, and the use which the public is to have of the property, or how the public is to be benefited by the use of it . . . is by no means fixed and definite. . . .\n\n\"It is not claimed that there is a present demand for the 50,000 electrical horse power. It is not claimed that the [power company] has a franchise to enter any of the cities or towns mentioned, or that it will or can obtain one. It does not appear that there are any street or other railways to utilize its product. It is not under contract or obligation to furnish electricity to any person, or for any purpose.\" Id., 667. The court determined that the proposed condemnation was not for a public purpose and, therefore, reversed the lower court's order. Id., 670-71.\n\nSignificantly, the Washington Supreme Court did not rely merely on the stated purpose of the taking in reaching its conclusion but, rather, examined all of the available evidence to determine whether the actual use would, in fact, be for a public or private purpose. See id., 667-71. Many other courts have adopted similar reasoning. See Kessler v. Indianapolis, 199 Ind. 420, 426, 157 N.E. 547 (1927) (courts not limited to consideration of whether use described in condemnation proceedings is public but may consider \"surrounding facts and circumstances tending to show what is the actual, principal and real use to be made of the property\" [emphasis added]); see also Walker v. Shasta Power Co., 160 F. 856, 860 (9th Cir. 1908) (corporation's right of eminent domain is not tested solely by description of public uses and private purposes contained in articles of incorporation, but may be determined \"by evidence aliunde showing the actual purpose in view\" [emphasis added]); Wilton v. St. Johns, 98 Fla. 26, 47, 123 So. 527 (1929) (\"courts have the ultimate power and duty to determine . . . whether . . . [condemnation in any given case] is in fact for [a] public or a private use\" [emphasis added]); Brown v. Gerald, 100 Me. 351, 357, 61 A. 785 (1905) (actual purpose of taking authorized by power company's charter was \"open to judicial inquiry\"); Kirkwood v. Venable, 351 Mo. 460, 466-68, 173 S.W.2d 8 (1943) (inasmuch as evidence indicated that condemned property was needed for public park, was suitable for public park and would be used by city for public park, court determined that condemnation was for public use); Kansas City v. Liebi, 298 Mo. 569, 591, 593, 252 S.W. 404 (1923) (evidence established that protective ordinance restricting use of and condemning rights to property would prevent overcrowding and make city more attractive, thereby promoting health, general welfare, growth and general prosperity of city, and that considerable part of community would actually use or benefit from contemplated improvement); Charlotte v. Heath, 226 N.C. 750, 754, 756, 40 S.E.2d 600 (1946) (evidence established that intended use of right-of-way allowing property owners living outside city limits to connect to sewer lines would be public); State ex rel. Harlan v. Centralia-Chehalis Electric Ry. & Power Co., 42 Wash. 632, 639-40, 85 P. 344 (1906) (in determining question of public use in case in which power company sought to condemn land, court was \"not confined to . . . the description of those objects and purposes as set forth in the [company's] articles of [incorporation], but [could consider] evidence aliunde . . . showing the actual business proposed to be conducted\" [emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]); cf. Linggi v. Garovotti, 45 Cal. 2d 20, 27, 286 P.2d 15 (1955) (private party authorized by statute to acquire easement by eminent domain for sewer connection to existing public sewer system must make strong evidentiary showing establishing that taking will benefit public). Accordingly, judicial review to determine whether a particular use will in fact be for a public or private purpose has been an accepted practice for nearly a century.\n\nThe importance of judicial review in determining whether property taken by eminent domain for private economic development will in fact be used for a public purpose cannot be underestimated. Economic growth is a far more indirect and nebulous benefit than the building of roads and courthouses or the elimination of urban blight. Indeed, plans for future hotels and office buildings that purportedly will add jobs and tax revenue to the economic base of a community are just as likely to be viewed as a bonanza to the developers who build them as they are a benefit to the public. Furthermore, in the absence of statutory safeguards to ensure that the public purpose will be accomplished, there are too many unknown factors, such as a weak economy, that may derail such a project in the early and intermediate stages of its implementation.\n\nThe economic conditions that existed when this court rendered its earliest decision regarding a taking for private economic development;[14] Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 532; were very different in nature from the economic conditions that now define our world. The petitioner in that case, Samuel E. Olmstead, was a grocery merchant in a manufacturing community in which the public relied on Olmstead's store for all of their supplies, including ground feed for pigs, poultry, cows and other domestic animals. Id., 536 (reporter's case summary). Olmstead owned land upon which he had erected a water mill \"for the purpose of grinding [the] flour and feed [that were sold at his store] and for doing custom work such as is usually done in a country mill . . . .\"[15] Id., 533 (reporter's case summary). The land also contained a mill pond and a dam. Id. Olmstead found it necessary to raise the dam and flood the property of the respondent, Samuel R.P. Camp, in order to ensure the proper operation of the mill. Id. Olmstead petitioned the court under the Flowage Act of 1864[16] to grant him the right to flood Camp's land and to determine the damages owed. Id., 532 (reporter's case summary).\n\nA court-appointed committee concluded that the flooding of Camp's property was for a public use. Id., 534 (reporter's case summary). The committee determined that Olmstead could raise the dam, had a right to keep and to maintain it permanently and, consequently, owed certain damages to Camp. Id. Camp appealed from the committee's decision.\n\nOn appeal, this court upheld the committee's decision and found in favor of Olmstead. Id., 552. The court characterized the issue to be decided as one \"involving [the] rights of property guaranteed by the fundamental law, and . . . the interests of business and the prosperity of the state.\" Id., 545. The court concluded: \"From the first settlement of the country grist-mills of this description have been in some sense peculiar institutions, invested with a general interest. Towns have procured them to be established and maintained. The state has regulated their tolls. In many instances they have been not merely a convenience, but almost a necessity in the community.\" Id., 552.\n\nThe court thus observed that grist mills played an integral part in the subsistence of the local community because they ground the feed and flour upon which the economic lifeblood of the community depended. The court described the proper functioning of grist mills not only as consonant with the public interest, but, in certain instances, as essential to the community's continued viability. Accordingly, the raising of the height of the dam and the taking of Camp's property were akin to the taking of property today for use by a public utility. See, e.g., Connecticut College v. Calvert, supra, 87 Conn. 426 (characterizing public use for which land was taken in Olmstead as \"governmental\" in nature because of great advantage to community). In stark contrast, the private development contemplated under chapter 132 of the General Statutes only can be described as \"governmental\" in nature if the benefits of increased tax revenue and new jobs are actually realized.\n\nI therefore submit that, just as the taking of nonblighted property in a blighted area is subject to additional scrutiny to determine whether the taking is \"essential\" to the redevelopment plan; see Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 259 Conn. 605; so, too, should a heightened standard of judicial review be required to ensure that the constitutional rights of private property owners are protected adequately when property is taken for private economic development under chapter 132 of the General Statutes. Justice demands no less.CHeightened Judicial ReviewOther jurisdictions with similar concerns have attempted to create more exacting standards of judicial scrutiny in the context of takings for private economic development. In Poletown Neighborhood Council v. Detroit, supra, 410 Mich. 616, in which property was to be acquired for the construction of a General Motors assembly plant; id., 628; the majority adopted a standard of heightened scrutiny requiring substantial proof of a clear and significant public benefit in determining whether the contemplated use constituted a legitimate public purpose. Id., 634-35. Finding that standard insufficient, one of the two dissenting justices in Poletown Neighborhood Council proposed a stricter standard of review that would require a showing of \"1) public necessity of the extreme sort, 2) continuing accountability to the public, and 3) selection of land according to facts of independent public significance.\" (Emphasis in original.) Id., 674-75 (Ryan, J., dissenting). More recently, the suggestion has been made that property rights should be elevated to the status of a \"fundamental\" right and that a strict scrutiny analysis should be conducted when property is taken for private economic development. See S. Jones, Note, supra, 50 Syracuse L. Rev. 314.\n\nIn its memorandum of decision, the trial court in the present case declared that \"[t]here are, in fact, limits on the constitutional propriety of using the power of eminent domain for . . . `pure economic development . . . .'\" The trial court rejected a standard of heightened scrutiny, however, on the basis of Bugryn v. Bristol, 63 Conn. App. 98, 774 A.2d 1042, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 927, 776 A.2d 1143, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1019, 122 S. Ct. 544, 151 L. Ed. 2d 422 (2001), in which the Appellate Court stated that \"our Supreme Court has not applied a heightened standard of review in previous disputes concerning the nature of a taking . . . .\" Id., 102 n.7. The present case, therefore, provides this court with an opportunity to consider the heightened standard of judicial review that the court in Bugryn identified as lacking.\n\nI submit that judicial review of the condemnations in the present case should consist of a four step process in which the burden of proof is shifted between the respective parties at various stages in the analysis. See, e.g., Potter v. Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co., 241 Conn. 199, 235-37, 694 A.2d 1319 (1997) (setting forth evidentiary framework through which burden of proof is shifted between parties in product liability action). Judicial review should begin with consideration of whether the statutory scheme is facially constitutional. In light of well established judicial deference to determinations of public use by state legislative bodies, the party opposing the taking should bear the initial burden of proving that the contemplated public use of private economic development is unconstitutional. Should that party succeed in meeting its difficult burden, the inquiry should end and no taking should be permitted.\n\nIf the court concludes, however, that the proposed economic development is a valid public use, the party opposing the taking should bear the additional burden of proving, in accordance with the deferential standard of review afforded to legislative determinations of public use, that the primary intent of the particular economic development plan is to benefit private, rather than public, interests. Should that burden also be met, any taking pursuant to the plan should be deemed unconstitutional and the inquiry should end.\n\nIn the event that the court concludes that the plan is constitutional, the burden should shift to the taking party to prove that the specific economic development contemplated by the plan will, in fact, result in a public benefit.[17] \"[T]he burden [of proof] properly rests upon the party who must establish the affirmative proposition, to whose case the fact in question is essential, who has the burden of pleading a fact, who has readier access to knowledge about the fact, or whose contention departs from what would be expected in the light of everyday experience.\" Albert Mendel & Son, Inc. v. Krogh, 4 Conn. App. 117, 124 n.6, 492 A.2d 536 (1985). Accordingly, shifting the burden of proof is appropriate at this point in the inquiry because the taking party has greater access than the opposing party to information regarding developer interest in the properties and the progress of negotiations relating to the disposition of the properties.\n\nThe level of proof necessary to meet the burden of establishing that the anticipated economic development will result in a public benefit should be clear and convincing evidence. The clear and convincing standard traditionally applies in civil cases \"to protect particularly important individual interests . . . .\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Rizzo, 266 Conn. 171, 211 n.22, 833 A.2d 363 (2003), quoting Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 424, 99 S. Ct. 1804, 60 L. Ed. 2d 323 (1979). \"[I]n cases governed by this burden, because society regards the individual interests involved to be very important, and because society imposes most of the risk of error on the party so burdened, we also require a very high degree of subjective certitude for the burden to be satisfied: the fact finder must be persuaded to a high degree of probability.\"?[18] State v. Rizzo, supra, 211 n.22. In other words, the party must prove that \"the evidence induces in the mind of the trier a reasonable belief that the facts asserted are highly probably true, that the probability that they are true or exist is substantially greater than the probability that they are false or do not exist. . . . [The clear and convincing standard is] a very demanding standard that should operate as a weighty caution upon the minds of all judges, and it forbids relief whenever the evidence is loose, equivocal or contradictory.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Durso v. Vessichio, 79 Conn. App. 112, 123, 828 A.2d 1280 (2003).\n\nIn civil cases involving property disputes, differing levels of proof are required depending on the type of claim under consideration. For example, clear and convincing evidence is required to prove a claim that land has been taken by adverse possession. E.g., Wildwood Associates, Ltd. v. Esposito, 211 Conn. 36, 42, 557 A.2d 1241 (1989). This is because title becomes absolute in the adverse possessor if that standard of proof is satisfied. Takings for private economic development resemble takings by adverse possession because property owners in both situations lose title to their land. Accordingly, it is consistent with existing law to place the burden on the taking party and to require that the standard of proof be clear and convincing evidence when property is taken by eminent domain for private economic development.\n\nI also believe that the clear and convincing standard is compelled in this context because of the tremendous social costs of the takings, costs that are difficult to quantify but that are nonetheless real. The fact that certain families have lived in their homes for decades and wish to remain should not, in my view, be summarily dismissed as part of a cost-benefit analysis typically performed by the legislature. At a minimum, the distress suffered by the plaintiffs because of their relocation to another neighborhood that lacks the same comforting familiarity and associations as their old neighborhood should be considered as additional justification for a higher level of proof. I therefore believe that the best way to protect the rights of property owners in cases involving takings for private economic development is to require that the taking party prove by clear and convincing evidence that development prospects are such that the condemned property will, in fact, be used for the intended public purpose.\n\nCourts and legislatures have employed the clear and convincing standard of proof in other constitutional, legislative and common-law contexts involving important questions of fact. Miller v. Commissioner of Correction, 242 Conn. 745, 796, 700 A.2d 1108 (1997). For example, when constitutional rights are at stake, as in the present case, a nonparent petitioning for visitation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-59 must prove the requisite relationship and the harm that would result from the denial of visitation by clear and convincing evidence in order to protect the parents' liberty interests in the care, custody and control of their children. Roth v. Weston, 259 Conn. 202, 228, 232, 789 A.2d 431 (2002). \"[D]ue process [also] requires [that] the clear and convincing test be applied to the termination of parental rights because it is the complete severance by court order of the legal relationship, with all its rights and responsibilities, between the child and his parent . . . .\" (Emphasis in original.) Id., 231. In still another context, we have held that, in order to protect a criminal defendant's constitutional right of confrontation, the state must prove \"a compelling need for excluding the defendant from the witness room during the videotaping of a minor victim's testimony\"; State v. Jarzbek, 204 Conn. 683, 704, 529 A.2d 1245 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1061, 108 S. Ct. 1017, 98 L. Ed. 2d 982 (1988); by establishing, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant's presence would seriously call into question the trustworthiness of the victim's testimony. Id., 704-705. I submit that the taking of private property for private economic development is equally deserving of this very demanding standard of proof for all of the foregoing reasons,[19] especially in light of the fact that such projects may be abandoned within three years of their approval if market conditions change and the plan of development cannot be implemented. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-200 (b).\n\nThe trial court's subsidiary findings as to the actual future use of the properties taken are findings of fact that should not be overturned unless they are clearly erroneous. See, e.g., State v. Pinder, 250 Conn. 385, 420, 736 A.2d 857 (1999); State v. Atkinson, 235 Conn. 748, 759, 670 A.2d 276 (1996). In light of the constitutional interests at stake, however, the issue of whether the properties actually will be used for a public purpose is an ultimate issue that should be reviewed by this court on the basis of its own \"scrupulous examination\" of the record. State v. Pinder, supra, 420. This is necessary to ensure that judicial review \"comports with constitutional standards of due process.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) State v. Hafford, 252 Conn. 274, 298, 746 A.2d 150 (trial court's finding that confession was voluntary closely scrutinized to protect defendant's constitutional rights), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 855, 121 S. Ct. 136, 148 L. Ed. 2d 89 (2000).\n\nFinally, if the trial court concludes that the condemned property will be used for a public purpose, it should be incumbent upon the party opposing the taking, on the basis of the deferential standard of review that we accord to legislative determinations of public use, to prove that the specific condemnation at issue is not reasonably necessary to implement the plan.\n\nThe shifting of the burden of proof, as suggested, is not unusual in circumstances in which we have deemed constitutional interests to be extremely significant. For example, a burden shifting analysis has been adopted in employment discrimination cases. McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-805, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973) (after complainant establishes prima facie case of discrimination, employer must articulate legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for adverse employment action and complainant then must prove employer engaged in intentional discrimination); see also Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 142-43, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 147 L. Ed. 2d 105 (2000); Board of Education v. Commission on Human Rights & Opportunities, 266 Conn. 492, 505-506, 832 A.2d 660 (2003). The burden of proof also is shifted to the decision-making party in affordable housing land use appeals. General Statutes \u00a7 8-30g (in administrative appeal from decision to deny application, burden on local commission to prove that decision is supported by sufficient evidence in record); see Quarry Knoll II Corp. v. Planning & Zoning Commission, 256 Conn. 674, 733, 780 A.2d 1 (2001); see also West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. v. Town Council, 228 Conn. 498, 514, 636 A.2d 1342 (1994) (legislature \"placed the burden of proof on the commission . . . and not, as in traditional land use appeals, on the applicant\" [internal quotation marks omitted]). Claims that a prosecutor has used peremptory challenges in violation of the equal protection clause are treated in a similar manner. See, e.g., Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 97-98, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986) (following defendant's prima facie showing that prosecutor exercised peremptory challenge on basis of race, burden shifts to prosecutor to articulate race-neutral explanation for striking juror after which burden shifts to defendant to show that prosecutor's articulated reasons are insufficient or merely pretextual); see also State v. Dehaney, 261 Conn. 336, 344-45, 803 A.2d 267 (2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1217, 123 S. Ct. 1318, 154 L. Ed. 2d 1070 (2003). Harmless error analysis involves a comparable approach when the alleged impropriety is of constitutional magnitude in that the burden to prove that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt rests with the state. E.g., State v. Francis, 267 Conn. 162, 188, 836 A.2d 1191 (2003); State v. Cavell, 235 Conn. 711, 720, 670 A.2d 261 (1996). Accordingly, the adoption of a burden shifting analysis in cases involving the taking of property for private economic development is consistent with our approach in other contexts in which a constitutional right is at stake.\n\nThe adoption of a burden shifting analysis also is consistent with the takings procedure followed in other jurisdictions that do not place the burden of attacking a routine taking on the property owner, as Connecticut does. See generally 27 Am. Jur. 2d 45, supra, \u00a7 479. General Statutes \u00a7 48-23 provides in relevant part: \"When, under the provisions of any statute authorizing the condemnation of land in the exercise of the right of eminent domain, an appraisal of damages has been returned to the clerk of the Superior Court . . . and when the amount of appraisal has been paid or secured to be paid or deposited with the State Treasurer . . . any judge of the Superior Court may, upon application and proof of such payment or deposit, order such clerk to issue an execution commanding a state marshal to put the parties entitled thereto into peaceable possession of the land so condemned.\"[20] The procedure for taking property by eminent domain in Connecticut is less hospitable to the property owner than in most other jurisdictions because \"the party to whom is delegated the right to determine whether particular land is necessary for a public use need only allege in his application to the court that he has so determined, leaving the burden of attack upon the adverse party.\" Bridgeport Hydraulic Co. v. Rempsen, 124 Conn. 437, 442, 200 A. 348 (1938); see also Hall v. Weston, 167 Conn. 49, 63, 355 A.2d 79 (1974) (\"burden of attacking [town's statutory] authority [to condemn land] rested upon the [property owner]\"). The primary means available to challenge the condemnation are: (1) an action to enjoin the taking; e.g., Bridgeport Hydraulic Co. v. Rempsen, supra, 442; or (2) a request that the court review the statement of compensation filed by the taking party. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-132.\n\nIn contrast, the most common method of condemning land in other jurisdictions is for the taking party to file in court a petition to take the property. 27 Am. Jur. 2d 45, supra, \u00a7 479. After the property owner and all other persons having an interest in the land sought to be condemned are joined in the action, a hearing is held at which the condemnor first must establish \"its right to condemn the land, and, in some [jurisdictions], the necessity of the taking.\" Id. If the court is satisfied that the taking is justified, damages are assessed and a final award is rendered. Id. In jurisdictions that follow this procedure, the burden, therefore, is not on the property owner to attack the condemnation but, rather, on the condemnor to establish its right to condemn. See id. A similar approach has been adopted for use in the federal courts. Pursuant to rule 71A of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the condemning party files a complaint identifying the property to be taken. Fed. R. Civ. P. 71A (c) (2). If the property owner objects to the taking, he may file an objection or defense, and the issue subsequently may be tried to the court or a jury. Fed. R. Civ. P. 71A (e) and (h). Accordingly, shifting the burden of proof, as proposed in this opinion, is consistent with the allocation of the burden of proof in other jurisdictions.III\n\nJUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE CONDEMNATIONSApplying the foregoing principles to the facts of this case, I agree with the majority that the legislative determination of public use, as expressed in chapter 132 of the General Statutes, is constitutional. I also agree that the primary purpose of the takings is to benefit the public. I do not agree, however, that the condemnations are constitutional in light of the fact that the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence to establish that the properties actually will be developed to achieve a public purpose. The foregoing conclusion being dispositive of this appeal, the court need not reach the issue of whether the condemnations are reasonably necessary to implement the development plan.AThe Facial Constitutionality of Chapter 132 of the General StatutesThe first issue to be addressed under the proposed standard of review is whether chapter 132 of the General Statutes\u2014\u00a7 8-186 in particular\u2014is facially constitutional insofar as it authorizes the use of the eminent domain power for private economic development. The majority explains that its analysis of this issue will be guided by the principle that the challenging party must prove the unconstitutionality of the statute beyond a reasonable doubt; e.g., State v. Ball, 260 Conn. 275, 280-81, 796 A.2d 542 (2002); and that it will review the statutory scheme pursuant to the well settled standard of substantial deference to the legislature's determination of public use. See part II A of the majority opinion. After examining the relevant case law of our state, our sister states and the United States Supreme Court, the majority ultimately concludes that private economic development projects, created and implemented pursuant to chapter 132 of the General Statutes, which create new jobs, increase tax revenue, and contribute to urban revitalization, satisfy the takings clauses of the federal and state constitutions. See id.\n\nI agree with the conclusion of the majority but do not agree entirely with the majority's analysis. Although the plaintiffs must prove the unconstitutionality of the statutory scheme beyond a reasonable doubt, the proper standard for reviewing the underlying claim is whether the state legislature \"rationally could have believed that the [statute] would promote its objective.\" (Emphasis in original.) Western & Southern Life Ins. Co. v. State Board of Equalization, 451 U.S. 648, 672, 101 S. Ct. 2070, 68 L. Ed. 2d 514 (1981); accord Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra, 467 U.S. 242; see also Housing Authority v. Higginbotham, 135 Tex. 158, 165, 143 S.W.2d 79 (1940) (legislative declaration of particular use is \"binding upon the courts unless such use is clearly and palpably of a private character\" [internal quotation marks omitted]); 26 Am. Jur. 2d 503, Eminent Domain \u00a7 61 (1996).\n\nIn Hawaii Housing Authority, the United States Supreme Court declared that \"[t]he `public use' requirement is . . . coterminous with the scope of a sovereign's police powers.\" Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra, 467 U.S. 240. As was previously noted; see footnote 7 of this opinion; the police power is commonly understood as \"the state's power to preserve and to promote the general welfare and . . . whatever affects the peace, security, safety, morals, health, and general welfare of the community . . . .\" 16A Am. Jur. 2d 251, Constitutional Law \u00a7 315 (1998); see also Reid v. Zoning Board of Appeals, 235 Conn. 850, 855, 670 A.2d 1271 (1996); Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc. v. Planning & Zoning Commission, 186 Conn. 466, 471, 442 A.2d 65 (1982). Guided by the principle of judicial deference to the legislative determination of public use, I therefore conclude, like the majority, that takings for private economic development are facially constitutional because Connecticut and federal courts have embraced, for more than a century, a broad construction of the public use clauses of the federal and state constitutions.\n\nAlmost 140 years ago, this court expressly rejected a narrow interpretation of the term \"public use\" as \"possession, occupation . . . [or] direct enjoyment . . . by the public\"; Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 546; and determined, instead, that the term means \"public usefulness, utility or advantage, or what is productive of general benefit . . . .\" Id. The court in Olmstead also advocated an interpretation of public use that could include private economic development when it made the following remarks about the far-reaching regional, and even national, effects of the water powered grist mill: \"It would be difficult to conceive a greater public benefit than garnering up the waste waters of innumerable streams and rivers and ponds and lakes, and compelling them with a gigantic energy to turn machinery and drive mills, and thereby build up cities and villages, and extend the business, the wealth, the population and the prosperity of the state. It is obvious that those sections of the country which afford the greatest facilities for the business of manufacturing and the mechanic arts, must become the workshops and warehouses of other vast regions not possessing these advantages . . . . It is of incalculable importance to this state to keep pace with others in the progress of improvements, and to render to its citizens the fullest opportunity for success in an industrial competition.\" Id., 551.\n\nThe court's broad definition of public use in Olmstead was reaffirmed in Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 141 (\"public use means `public usefulness, utility or advantage, or what is productive of general benefit'\"), and later echoed in Katz v. Brandon, supra, 156 Conn. 532-33 (\"The modern trend of authority is to expand and liberally construe the meaning of public purpose. The test of public use is . . . the right of the public to receive and enjoy its benefit.\" [Internal quotation marks omitted.]).\n\nIn Hawaii Housing Authority, the United States Supreme Court determined that a compensated taking is not proscribed by the takings clause when it is \"rationally related to a conceivable public purpose . . . .\" Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra, 467 U.S. 241. Accordingly, the definition of public use in General Statutes \u00a7 8-186, namely, \"the continued growth of industry and business within the state,\" survives the plaintiffs' facial constitutional challenge inasmuch as our legislature rationally could have concluded that the taking of private property for such a purpose would be of general benefit to the public.[21]BWhether the Primary Purpose of the Condemnations Is To Serve the Public InterestThe next step in the analysis is to consider, under the deferential standard of review, whether the primary purpose of the condemnations is to serve the public interest, with private benefits being incidental thereto, or whether private interests are paramount and the public purpose is incidental. In its discussion of this issue, the majority characterizes the trial court's determination that the takings were intended primarily to benefit the public as a finding of fact to be reviewed by this court under the clearly erroneous standard. See part II B of the majority opinion. The majority then concludes that the trial court's finding that the takings primarily were intended to serve the public interest, with private benefits being incidental thereto, was not clearly erroneous. See id.\n\nI agree with the majority that the takings were intended primarily to benefit the public. I disagree, however, that the trial court's determination regarding the public purpose of the condemnations is a factual finding subject to deferential review.\n\n\"The question [of] what is a public use is always one of law\"; 2 T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations (8th Ed. 1927) p. 1141; accord Poletown Neighborhood Council v. Detroit, supra, 410 Mich. 639 (Fitzgerald, J., dissenting); or, as in the present case, a mixed question of fact and law, because the trial court's determination as to public use rests on numerous factual findings regarding the goals, motives and interests of the public officials and private parties associated with the project. See, e.g.,State v. Silva, 65 Conn. App. 234, 255, 738 A.2d 7 (mixed questions of fact and law involve application of legal standard to historical fact determinations), cert. denied, 258 Conn. 929, 783 A.2d 1031 (2001). Accordingly, we review the trial court's factual findings for clear error but review de novo the court's legal determination that the takings primarily were intended to serve the public interest. See, e.g., State v. Gibbs, 254 Conn. 578, 592, 758 A.2d 327 (2000).\n\n\"[T]he line of demarcation between a use that is public and one that is strictly and entirely private is a line not eas[ily] . . . drawn.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 547. This is especially true in the present case, in which private interests potentially stand to gain significant financial benefits under the development plan. I nonetheless agree with the majority that the evidence in the record supports a finding that the condemnations of the plaintiffs' properties primarily were intended to serve the public interest, and that the development plan, on its face, and the goals and objectives set forth therein are in accord with chapter 132 of the General Statutes. Accordingly, there is no need to repeat in detail all of the facts upon which the majority relies.\n\nThe record clearly demonstrates that the development plan was not intended primarily to serve the interests of Pfizer, Inc., or any other private entity but, rather, to revitalize the local economy by creating temporary and permanent jobs, generating a significant increase in tax revenue, encouraging spin-off economic activities and maximizing public access to the waterfront. Furthermore, the proposed project is being undertaken in an economically \"distressed\" municipality in need of a stimulus to invigorate the local economy. Accordingly, the goals of the development plan are consistent with the important public interest described in General Statutes \u00a7 8-186 of promoting the economic welfare of the state through the \"growth of industry and business within the state\" and \"meet[ing] the needs of industry and business . . . .\" Nevertheless, the conclusion that the development plan was intended primarily to benefit the public, per se, is insufficient to justify the takings.CWhether the Development Plan Will Result in a Public BenefitIn my view, the development plan as a whole cannot be considered apart from the condemnations because the constitutionality of condemnations undertaken for the purpose of private economic development depends not only on the professed goals of the development plan, but also on the prospect of their achievement. Accordingly, the taking party must assume the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the anticipated public benefit will be realized. The determination of whether the taking party has met this burden of proof involves an independent evaluation of the evidence by the court, with no deference granted to the local legislative authority. In the present case, the evidence fails to establish that the foregoing burden has been met.[22]\n\nThe record contains scant evidence to suggest that the predicted public benefit will be realized with any reasonable certainty. To the contrary, the evidence establishes that, at the time of the takings, there was no signed agreement to develop the properties, the economic climate was poor and the development plan contained no conditions pertaining to future development agreements that would ensure achievement of the intended public benefit if development were to occur.\n\nThe development plan calls for a hotel and conference center on parcel 1, residential dwellings on parcel 2, commercial office space on parcel 3, parking and marina support on parcel 4A, marina and water-related uses on parcel 4B, commercial office and retail space on parcels 5A, 5B and 5C, waterfront commercial uses on parcel 6, and additional office space on parcel 7. Despite extensive negotiations, however, no development agreement, which the trial court described as a \"necessary engine to start any development project,\" had been signed at the time of the takings. In fact, Marty Jones, president of Corcoran Jennison, the designated developer for parcels 1, 2 and 3, testified at a deposition that she could not even predict when such an agreement would be signed, although she was \"optimistic\" that it would be soon. Without an agreement, however, it is impossible to determine whether future development of the area primarily will benefit the public or even benefit the public at all. Several key project participants expressly recognized the importance of an agreement to such a determination in correspondence regarding the project and anticipated lawsuit.[23]\n\nNevertheless, some minimal evidence was admitted as to the terms of a \"proposed\" agreement,[24] and, insofar as those terms provide for the leasing of parcels 1, 2 and 3 to Corcoran Jennison by the development corporation at a rate of $1 per year for a term of ninety-nine years, they appear to be more beneficial to the developer than to the city. Under the agreement, it appears that the city would be locked into a long-term commitment to a single developer, who then would be in a position to reap substantial financial rewards without a corresponding penalty if the developer does not perform as expected. In addition, the very generous terms of the proposed agreement are indicative of either an extremely weak real estate market or a possible violation of General Statutes \u00a7 8-200 (b) because that statute suggests that property acquired pursuant to chapter 132 of the General Statutes must be sold or leased to a developer at \"fair market value\" or \"fair rental value . . . .\" Accordingly, the terms of the unsigned, proposed agreement do not appear to be consistent with the long-term public interest.\n\nFurthermore, the evidence in the record establishes that the real estate market at the time of the takings was depressed and that prospects, therefore, were poor that the contemplated public use could be achieved with any reasonable certainty. Specifically, the trial court stated that \"[t]he [development plan] itself says that as of the date of its preparation its studies show that rent levels [of] class A office buildings have stabilized, but are below the level needed to support new speculative construction. In fact, historical values of class A office buildings have not recovered sufficiently to justify new construction except for end users.\" The trial court also referred to testimony that \"[the city of] New London is still recovering from the recession of the early 1990s . . . market values are still well below replacement cost and new construction is generally not feasible. . . . [T]he demand for class A office space in New London at the present time is soft . . . .\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Indeed, testimony revealed that newly constructed office buildings in Shaw's Cove, an area adjacent to the project area, had not been fully occupied for more than fifteen years. Similar testimony described unsuccessful efforts by the redevelopment agency, over the course of several years, to attract investor interest in the construction of commercial office space at still another nearby location.\n\nAdditional testimony revealed that commercial real estate brokers had received few inquiries from companies with similar needs to those of Pfizer, Inc., and that, because it is difficult for the city of New London to compete against the city of New Haven in the market for biotechnology-bioscience office space, it is not economically feasible to develop this type of office space without a definite end user that will pay the rent to support the cost. Specific testimony adduced as to parcel 3 revealed that, in light of the uncertainty surrounding demand and the feasibility of creating biotechnology-bioscience office space, and in light of the fact that office development on parcel 3 probably would be deferred until after the development of office space on parcel 2, any design should remain flexible to accommodate future demand. The trial court relied on testimony that \"market conditions do not justify construction of new commercial space . . . on a speculative basis.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Furthermore, the trial court noted that \"buildings are not built without tenants and as of June, 2001, there were no tenant commitments as to . . . the new[ly] proposed office buildings.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court also relied on testimony that \"flexibility is needed in this type of planning. Market conditions change and sites are developed over decades not years. There must be an ability reserved to make alterations as market conditions change.\"\n\nA close examination of the proposed plan from a financial standpoint also suggests that there were only limited prospects of a public benefit at the time of the takings. Although the trial court noted that the project ultimately would generate increased tax revenue, there apparently was no consideration of the loss in revenue that could result from the relocation of former residents and taxpayers out of the area during the ten, twenty or even thirty years that might be needed to fully implement the development plan.\n\nMoreover, although the city tax assessor projected that annual tax revenue from the project, when fully implemented, was expected to increase sevenfold to approximately $2.6 million, she also testified that her projection was based on an estimate of the square footage to be constructed, a figure that was subject to change. Indeed, testimony confirmed that the square footage and proposed uses very likely would change over the course of the project. In addition, due to the lack of a development schedule, there was no testimony as to when the projected tax revenue would be realized. Accordingly, the tax assessor's revenue projection may not come to fruition if the area is not developed in the manner and in the time frame predicted.\n\nFor example, the projected receipt of $422,100 in annual revenue from parcel 4A does not take into account the tax assessor's opinion that the property may be exempt from taxation if developed for a museum owned by the federal government, as one proposal had suggested. State or nonprofit ownership of the museum would generate a portion of the projected revenue, but revenue would fall well below the $422,100 currently estimated. Moreover, the tax assessor's opinion that the market value of a museum that costs $30 million to build would be only $18 million is yet another indication of the depressed real estate market. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the expected public investment in the project area of close to $80 million for a potential increase in annual tax revenue of $680,544 to $1,249,843,[25] at best, hardly can be considered a major financial benefit to the public. Accordingly, the projected increase in tax revenue should not be accepted at face value and does not support the conclusion that the project will further the public good.\n\nVarious other elements of the plan also are problematical. The record contains no evidence that the indirect benefits projected under the plan, namely, spin-off economic activities and between 500 and 940 indirect new jobs, will indeed be realized. There also is no evidence as to when in the next thirty years such benefits might be realized. In addition, although the trial court relied on testimony that the city of New London has limited high end housing, it also noted that there was little explanation as to why seventy to ninety high end attached residences would significantly improve the overall housing situation in a distressed municipality. The trial court further noted that high end housing concentrated in one small area of the city would not be likely to have a multiplier effect. Accordingly, the only possible positive consequence of the housing to be constructed appears to be a limited increase in tax revenue. This revenue is impossible to evaluate, however, because it is not yet known whether a future development agreement will include a tax abatement incentive to encourage development of the property or other terms and conditions that may not be in accord with the general purposes set forth in the development plan or the applicable statutory scheme.\n\nThe development plan also contains few, if any, performance requirements for future developers. Section 6.2 of the plan, which concerns the disposition of the properties, contains a general description of restrictions on parcel use but no firm timetable for project implementation, no indication as to whether future developers will be offered tax abatements or other incentives that might not be in the public interest, and no indication of possible penalties if developers do not perform as required. Moreover, \u00a7 6.2.3 of the development plan provides that \"[p]roceeds from sale of disposition parcels shall be used to offset costs of implementation of this [development plan].\" The provision in the development plan that purports to lease parcels 1, 2 and 3 to a developer at the sum of $1 per year for a term of ninety-nine years is particularly troubling when viewed in this context.\n\nThe defendants note that the budget for the project is almost $80 million, of which approximately $31.1 million has been spent to date, that the project has been approved by numerous state and local agencies, that the city of New London has spent thousands of dollars planning road improvements to make the site more attractive to prospective tenants and that other properties in the project area have been acquired in accordance with the plan objectives. This has little bearing, however, on whether there is any reasonable certainty that the planned public benefit will be realized. As the trial court conceded, \"the protections afforded by the [takings] clauses of the federal and state constitutions would be hollow indeed\" if takings were found to be constitutional merely because the condemning authority and various government agencies thought and acted as if they were so.\n\nThe record, therefore, fails to establish that there was any momentum in the project from a development standpoint or any reasonable development prospects for parcels 3 and 4A at the time of the takings. Evidence to the contrary consists of vague predictions of future demand. The trial court noted, for example, that according to the development plan, \"the city [of New London] is at the threshold of major economic revitalization and the key catalyst is the Pfizer [Inc.] research facility\"; (emphasis added); and that \"a significant shortage of office space [was expected] by 2010,\" but none of the evidence in the record supports this conclusion. In most of the important economic development cases cited by the majority to support its analysis, developers had been identified and were prepared to develop the properties in question. See, e.g., Poletown Neighborhood Council v. Detroit, supra, 410 Mich. 628 (property to be conveyed to General Motors Corporation for construction of automobile assembly plant); Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental, LLC, supra, 199 Ill. 2d 229-30 (property to be conveyed to Gateway International Motorsports Corporation for expansion of racetrack parking facilities); Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 551 (property subject to taking to be used in operation of existing grist mill).\n\nAlthough the trial court acknowledged that, for economic development policy to be practical, a substantial period of time might have to pass before a project plan can be accomplished, it nonetheless declared that \"[t]he intent of chapter 132 [of the General Statutes] would be crippled if government intervention would only be feasible if immediate project development is possible\u2014 economically distressed communities are the very ones where, despite state intervention, project accomplishment might be difficult.\" On the other hand, I would submit that government intervention to take non-blighted properties by eminent domain is unwarranted in any circumstance in which there is no realistic prospect of a future public benefit. In the present case, there is no development agreement or time frame within which the proposed development must take place; indeed, all of the evidence suggests that the real estate market is depressed and the development plan itself contains no detailed provisions to ensure that the future use will serve the public interest. Accordingly, the record in the present case does not contain clear and convincing evidence to establish that this portion of the test has been satisfied. I therefore would conclude that the takings are unconstitutional.\n\nHaving concluded that there is no reasonable certainty that the proposed public benefit will be accomplished, there is no need to consider whether the condemnations are reasonably necessary to implement the plan.[26] I therefore need not address the majority's analysis of that issue.IV\n\nCONCLUSIONIn summary, I believe that chapter 132 of the General Statutes is constitutional on its face.[27] Additionally, there is very little evidence to support the plaintiffs' claim that the development plan was created primarily for the benefit of private interests. The benefits expressed in the development plan, namely, an increased tax base, job creation and the revitalization of the city of New London, as well as other evidence presented at trial, support the majority's conclusion that the plan is consistent with the public purpose and the goals set forth in chapter 132 of the General Statutes. See part II of the majority opinion. Nevertheless, the takings of the plaintiffs' properties are unconstitutional because, in my view, the evidence is not clear and convincing that the property taken actually will be used for a public purpose.\n\nTo highlight this concern, consider the following hypothetical. A town is economically distressed and has seen no significant development for years. In good faith, and in accordance with the procedural prerequisites contained in chapter 132 of the General Statutes, the town creates a master plan of development in 1999 that designates an area within the city limits for mixed use development. A marketing study is completed while the plan is being drafted and demonstrates no significant shortage of office space until 2010, no immediate demand for hotel space without a corporate user that will subsidize the occupancy of up to one half of the projected 200 room facility, and no demonstrated demand for up-scale residential units to fulfill local housing needs. Despite this scenario, the town proceeds with the plan of development and settles on the above uses.\n\nFurther efforts result in a determination regarding the scope of the project and the location and general size of various proposed buildings. The master plan is submitted to a public hearing and subsequently approved by the local governing body. The plan projects that the new development will create between 518 and 867 construction jobs and 1200 and 2300 direct or indirect permanent jobs, and will result in an estimated sevenfold increase in annual property tax revenue. The master plan does not include any minimum standards that the contemplated private developer will be required to satisfy.[28] While the taking authority has had numerous discussions with a particular developer, there has been no agreement on the terms of a development agreement. Nevertheless, the taking authority purchases certain parcels of land in the economic development area and takes other properties by eminent domain. No one contends, under this scenario, that the properties acquired by eminent domain are not reasonably necessary for development to occur as provided in the master plan.\n\nNow consider the following scenario. Six months after the takings are completed, an interested developer is located. The developer contends that the economic conditions of the town and region are such that the project is not economically feasible unless the development agreement requires the town and the taking authority to do the following: (1) remediate the environmental conditions affecting the property, (2) replace the road and utility infrastructure, and (3) take measures to reduce the risk of coastal flooding, all at a cost of more than $70 million. Additionally, the developer insists that the town abate property taxes on properties located in the development area for a period of years and, rather than require the developer to purchase the improved property at fair market value, enter into an agreement with the developer to lease the property for ninety-nine years for the sum of $1 per year. Furthermore, the developer agrees to commence construction only after he is able to find viable tenants for the property or when a particular economic index for the area indicates demand for the uses, such as when the vacancy rate for class A office space drops below a certain level.\n\nAs I understand the majority's view, after according deference to the taking authority, the takings in the above scenario, which occur six months before any of the terms of the development agreement are known, would withstand a challenge by property owners who wish to remain in their homes. I, however, would find the takings to be, at best, premature. The majority has created a test that can aptly be described as the \"Field of Dreams\"[29] test. The majority assumes that if the enabling statute is constitutional, if the plan of development is drawn in good faith and if the plan merely states that there are economic benefits to be realized, that is enough. Thus, the test is premised on the concept that \"if you build it, [they] will come,\" and fails to protect adequately the rights of private property owners.\n\nI am not suggesting that an absolute guarantee is necessary to ensure that private economic development will occur as planned. Such a guarantee would be unrealistic in light of the fact that many unforeseen events could affect the plan's implementation. For example, positive economic trends might falter and committed developers might be confronted with unanticipated difficulties that impair their ability to carry out plan objectives. When such difficulties are apparent at the very outset of the planning process, however, a course of action should not be endorsed based entirely on speculation.\n\nTo conclude, I would grant the legislature no deference on this issue and place the burden on the taking authority to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the public benefit anticipated in the economic development agreement is reasonably ensured. This, in my view, cannot be accomplished without knowing initially what the actual public benefit will be. In the present case, it is entirely unknown whether the public interest will be served. There are no assurances of a public use in the development plan; there was no signed development agreement at the time of the takings; and all of the evidence suggests that the economic climate will not support the project so that the public benefits can be realized. The determination of whether the private benefit will be incidental to the public benefit requires an examination of all of the pieces to the puzzle. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from parts II, IV and VI of the majority opinion.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[1] This case originally was argued before a panel of this court consisting of Justices Borden, Norcott, Palmer, Vertefeuille and Zarella. Thereafter, the court, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 70-7 (b), sua sponte, ordered that the case be considered en banc. Accordingly, Chief Justice Sullivan and Justice Katz were added to the panel, and they have read the record, briefs and transcript of the oral argument.\n\n[2] The individual plaintiffs are Susette Kelo, Thelma Brelesky, Pasquale Cristofaro, Margherita Cristofaro, Wilhelmina Dery, Charles Dery, James Guretsky, Laura Guretsky, Pataya Construction Limited Partnership and William Von Winkle.\n\n[3] The plaintiffs appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.\n\n[4] The defendants cross appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the cross appeal, along with the plaintiffs' appeal; see footnote 3 of this opinion; to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2.\n\n[5] A major health club complex available to hotel guests and other city residents initially had been planned for parcel 3. It subsequently was relocated to parcel 1 as part of the hotel and conference center complex because, according to Admiral David Goebel, the development corporation's chief operating officer, the development corporation and its consultants had concluded that there was \"no stand-alone economic viability for such a health club.\" The health club constructed pursuant to the development plan, however, will remain open to the public.\n\n[6] The alternate plans considered by the development corporation included: (1) no action, with the assumption that some development activities would proceed under the direction of other entities, such as the United States Navy, without action by the development corporation; (2) recreational and cultural facilities to complement the adjacent state park; (3) residential construction with minor amounts of retail and office space; (4) a business campus supported by the hotel and conference center; and (5) two mixed use alternates combining residences, recreational, commercial, hotel and retail uses in differing arrangements.\n\n[7] The New London region has benefited economically by the opening and the expansion of casinos, specifically Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun. We note, however, that the city itself has not been a major beneficiary of this economic growth.\n\n[8] As required by statute; see General Statutes \u00a7 8-191; the state department of economic and community development, the state department of environmental protection, the state office of policy and management, and the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments, also approved the development plan. Hereafter, all references in this opinion to the department are to the department of economic and community development.\n\n[9] The trial court did, however, grant a temporary injunction to the parcel 3 property owners, pending the resolution of this case on appeal.\n\n[10] We first address the plaintiffs' statutory claims because \"[o]rdinarily, [c]onstitutional issues are not considered unless absolutely necessary to the decision of a case.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Bauer v. Waste Management of Connecticut, Inc., 234 Conn. 221, 230, 662 A.2d 1179 (1995).\n\n[11] The trial court also rejected the plaintiffs' contention that chapter 132 of the General Statutes applies only to multimunicipality economic development projects on contiguous land areas. We need not address this conclusion in any detail because the plaintiffs have not challenged it on appeal.\n\n[12] With regard to this purposive approach to statutory interpretation, our legislature recently has enacted Public Acts 2003, No. 03-154, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 03-154), which provides: \"The meaning of a statute shall, in the first instance, be ascertained from the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship, the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\" This case does not implicate P.A. 03-154. We note that, in the present case, the relevant statutory text and the relationship of that text to other statutes is not \"plain and unambiguous . . . .\" P.A. 03-154. Accordingly, our analysis is not circumscribed to an examination of text alone, but rather properly may consider the various other sources helpful in the ascertainment of statutory meaning.\n\n[13] General Statutes \u00a7 8-186 provides: \"It is found and declared that the economic welfare of the state depends upon the continued growth of industry and business within the state; that the acquisition and improvement of unified land and water areas and vacated commercial plants to meet the needs of industry and business should be in accordance with local, regional and state planning objectives; that such acquisition and improvement often cannot be accomplished through the ordinary operations of private enterprise at competitive rates of progress and economies of cost; that permitting and assisting municipalities to acquire and improve unified land and water areas and to acquire and improve or demolish vacated commercial plants for industrial and business purposes and, in distressed municipalities, to lend funds to businesses and industries within a project area in accordance with such planning objectives are public uses and purposes for which public moneys may be expended; and that the necessity in the public interest for the provisions of this chapter is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.\"\n\n[14] Chapter 132 of the General Statutes originally had referred only to \"unified land areas.\" Public Acts 1967, No. 760, \u00a7 1. The legislature amended it to include the present term \"unified land and water areas\" in 1975. Public Acts 1975, No. 75-480, \u00a7 1.\n\n[15] General Statutes \u00a7 8-187 provides: \"As used in this chapter, (1) `municipality' means a town, city, consolidated town and city or consolidated town and borough; (2) `legislative body' means (A) the board of selectmen in a town that does not have a charter, special act or home rule ordinance relating to its government or (B) the council, board of aldermen, representative town meeting, board of selectmen or other elected legislative body described in a charter, special act or home rule ordinance relating to government in a city, consolidated town and city, consolidated town and borough or a town having a charter, special act, consolidation ordinance or home rule ordinance relating to its government; (3) `development agency' means the agency designated by a municipality under section 8-188 through which the municipality may exercise the powers granted under this chapter; (4) `development project' means a project conducted by a municipality for the assembly, improvement and disposition of land or buildings or both to be used principally for industrial or business purposes and includes vacated commercial plants; (5) `vacated commercial plants' means buildings formerly used principally for business or industrial purposes of which more than fifty per cent of the usable floor space is, or which it is anticipated, within eighteen months, shall be, unused or substantially underutilized; (6) `project area' means the area within which the development project is located; (7) `commissioner' means the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development; (8) `planning commission' means the planning and zoning commission designated pursuant to section 8-4a or the planning commission created pursuant to section 8-19; (9) `real property' means land, subterranean or subsurface rights, structures, any and all easements, air rights and franchises and every estate, right or interest therein; and (10) `business purpose' includes, but is not limited to, any commercial, financial or retail enterprise and includes any enterprise which promotes tourism and any property that produces income.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n[16] General Statutes \u00a7 8-189 provides: \"The development agency may initiate a development project by preparing a project plan therefor in accordance with regulations of the commissioner.

The development agency may, with the approval of the legislative body, and in the name of the municipality, acquire by eminent domain real property located within the project area and real property and interests therein for rights-of-way and other easements to and from the project area, in the same manner that a redevelopment agency may acquire real property under sections 8-128 to 8-133, inclusive, as if said sections specifically applied to development agencies. The development agency may, with the approval of the legislative body and, of the commissioner if any grants were made by the state under section 8-190 or 8-195 for such development project, and in the name of such municipality, transfer by sale or lease at fair market value or fair rental value, as the case may be, the whole or any part of the real property in the project area to any person, in accordance with the project plan and such disposition plans as may have been determined by the commissioner.\n\n(b) A development agency shall have all the powers necessary or convenient to undertake and carry out development plans and development projects, including the power to clear, demolish, repair, rehabilitate, operate, or insure real property while it is in its possession, to make site improvements essential to the preparation of land for its use in accordance with the development plan, to install, construct or reconstruct streets, utilities and other improvements necessary for carrying out the objectives of the development project, and, in distressed municipalities, as defined in section 32-9p, to lend funds to businesses and industries in a manner approved by the commissioner.\"(Emphasis added.)\n\n[18] General Statutes \u00a7 8-198 provides: \"The commissioner is authorized to make and enforce reasonable regulations to carry out the provisions of this chapter.\"\n\n[19] General Statutes \u00a7 8-199 provides: \"Any development agency shall exercise its powers in the name of the municipality, and all bonds issued pursuant to this chapter shall be issued in the name of the municipality and title to land taken or acquired pursuant to a development plan shall be solely in the name of the municipality.\"\n\n[20] This definition is not inconsistent with the legislative history of Public Acts 1967, No. 760, which reveals that the act was intended to enable and encourage industrial development in districts that are comprised of more than one municipality. Representative William S. Mayer, sponsor of the legislation, stated: \"This particular bill will be of interest to towns interested in industrial development not only within their own confines but within multi-town districts. A section of this particular act provides that towns can get together to develop industrial land on contiguous borders.\" 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 10, 1967 Sess., pp. 4917-18.\n\n[21] Indeed, \u00a7 8-187 (9) is identical to the definition of \"`[r]eal property'\" found in chapter 130 of the General Statutes, the urban renewal chapter. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-125 (f).\n\n[22] Section 8-198-10 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in relevant part: \"(a) The amount of funds available to a municipality for development grants is based on a percentage of the net project cost.

At present municipalities can acquire and improve unified land areas only. They also have the power to clear, repair, operate and insure real property. This Bill adds rehabilitate to this list.\" [Emphasis added.]).\n\n[24] Public Act 74-184, \u00a7 1, also amended \u00a7 8-186, to declare expressly that it is a public use and purpose \"to acquire and improve or demolish vacated commercial plants for industrial or business purposes . . . .\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n[25] Accordingly, we disagree with the plaintiffs' contention that the requirement of a relocation plan refers to the chapter's definition of vacated commercial plant, which contemplates partial occupation. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-187 (5) (\"`vacated commercial plants' means buildings formerly used principally for business or industrial purposes of which more than fifty per cent of the usable floor space is, or which it is anticipated, within eighteen months, shall be, unused or substantially underutilized\").\n\n[26] Article first, \u00a7 11, of the constitution of Connecticut provides: \"The property of no person shall be taken for public use, without just compensation therefor.\"\n\n[27] The fifth amendment to the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \"No person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\" (Emphasis added.) The fifth amendment's public use clause has been made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. See, e.g., Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 231, 104 S. Ct. 2321, 81 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1984).\n\n[28] We note that, in Bugryn v. Bristol, 63 Conn. App. 98, 103-104, 774 A.2d 1042, cert. denied, 256 Conn. 927, 776 A.2d 1143, cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1019, 122 S. Ct. 544, 151 L. Ed. 2d 422 (2001), the Appellate Court rejected a factual challenge to the trial court's finding that the plaintiffs' land was not condemned for the purpose of benefiting and retaining a private manufacturer. The Appellate Court's decision in Bugryn, however, is of limited value in resolving the particular issue in the present case, because the parties in that case did not dispute the proposition that the development of an industrial park is a public use. Id., 104. The court in that case did note that, even if the industrial park plan did benefit the manufacturer, the public use of industrial park development was not disputed, and \"[w]here the public use which justifies the taking of the area in the first instance exists, an element over which there is no controversy in the present case, that same public purpose continues even though the property is later transferred to private persons.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; Broadriver, Inc. v. Stamford, 158 Conn. 522, 533-34, 265 A.2d 75 (1969), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 938, 90 S. Ct. 1841, 26 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1970).\n\n[29] The plaintiffs, in seeking invalidation of the eminent domain provisions of chapter 132 of the General Statutes under the public use clauses of the federal and state constitutions, provide a single, unitary analysis that does not assert that the state constitution's public use clause offers them greater protection than the federal constitution's public use clause. Their approach is confusing to us because their principal brief otherwise is replete with citations to cases such as Gohld Realty Co. v. Hartford, supra, 141 Conn. 135, Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental, LLC, 199 Ill. 2d 225, 240-41, 768 N.E.2d 1, cert. denied, 537 U.S. 880, 123 S. Ct. 88, 154 L. Ed. 2d 135 (2002), and Poletown Neighborhood Council v. Detroit, 410 Mich. 616, 633-35, 304 N.W.2d 455 (1981), which typically would support the separate state constitutional analysis required as a threshold matter for review by well established Connecticut precedent. See, e.g., State v. DeJesus, 260 Conn. 466, 480 n.11, 797 A.2d 1101 (2002) (separate state analysis required); State v. Geisler, 222 Conn. 672, 684-85, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992) (factors governing construction of state constitution enumerated). Moreover, the plaintiffs' principal brief, does not contain a discussion of any relevant federal precedent, such as Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra, 467 U.S. 229. We do note, however, that they do cite three significant federal cases in their reply brief.\n\n[30] A committee appointed pursuant to the flowage act recommended that the improvement be made, in furtherance of the public use. Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 534. With respect to public use, the trial court found that the mill operated generally for the public benefit in a farming community where people relied, but not exclusively, on it and other merchants to furnish food for people and animals. Id., 536. The court also found that the mill owner had no legal obligation to allow the public access to the mill, or to do milling for the public himself. Id., 537. The trial court then reserved for this court the question of whether allowing the improvements to the mill would be a public use. Id.\n\n[31] Even more tellingly, the court in Olmstead stated further: \"In none of the cases to which we have referred does the public as an active agent take and hold and occupy the property in actual possession. The term `public use' is synonymous with public benefit or advantage. It is equivalent to the language, so familiar in our statute in relation to highways, `of common convenience and necessity.'\n\n\"If there were any doubt on the subject on first principles, we understand it to be the settled law of the country that the flowing of land for the purposes of mills and manufactories, in view of its effect upon the community, is to be considered as a taking it for public use. It would be difficult to conceive a greater public benefit than garnering up the waste waters of innumerable streams and rivers and ponds and lakes, and compelling them with a gigantic energy to turn machinery and drive mills, and thereby build up cities and villages, and extend the business, the wealth, the population and the prosperity of the state. It is obvious that those sections of the country which afford the greatest facilities for the business of manufacturing and the mechanic arts, must become the workshops and warehouses of other vast regions not possessing these advantages; and must receive in exchange for the results of their industry and skill an abundant return of the rich products of the earth, including the precious metals. It is of incalculable importance to this state to keep pace with others in the progress of improvements, and to render to its citizens the fullest opportunity for success in an industrial competition.\" (Emphasis added.) Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 550-51.\n\n[32] Prior to the urban renewal cases, we note that this court has construed the phrase \"public purpose,\" in the context of spending public moneys, as synonymous with the term \"public use.\" In Barnes v. New Haven, 140 Conn. 8, 12-14, 98 A.2d 523 (1953), a taxpayer challenged the validity of an act creating a parking authority as lacking a public purpose under the emoluments clause, article first, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution. This court upheld the act as having the legitimate public purpose of addressing severe traffic problems, a situation that \"calls for an appropriate exercise of the police power of the state operating through the city as one of its municipalities.\" Id., 14. The court noted that \"[w]hether the act does provide for a legitimate public purpose in the constitutional sense involves the question whether it primarily serves, in a reasonable manner, to promote the public welfare. . . . If it does, that an incidental financial benefit may result to certain individuals as distinguished from the public at large does not deprive it of its legitimate public purpose.\" (Citations omitted.) Id., 14-15.\n\nAlthough Barnes is a spending case, and not a taking case, it is significant in our resolution of the present case. Indeed, the court in Barnes expressly used the terms \"public use\" and \"public purpose\" in an interchangeable manner, a definition that we later adopted in Katz v. Brandon, supra, 156 Conn. 532-33, a redevelopment taking case.\n\n[33] For the sake of clarity, we note that this court's opinion in Katz v. Brandon, supra, 156 Conn. 532-34, does not state whether its public use analysis is based specifically on either or both of the federal and state constitutions.\n\n[34] Indeed, this court in Katz v. Brandon, supra, 156 Conn. 533, noted that \"[i]n this day of keen competition to attract industry and business to a state or to a particular locality, public officials are expected to cooperate in helping an industry to locate in their community. They must be at all times alert in providing for future as well as present needs.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n\n[35] The court stated further: \"The public end may be as well or better served through an agency of private enterprise than through a department of government\u2014or so the Congress might conclude. We cannot say that public ownership is the sole method of promoting the public purposes of community redevelopment projects. What we have said also disposes of any contention concerning the fact that certain property owners in the area may be permitted to repurchase their properties for redevelopment in harmony with the over-all plan. That, too, is a legitimate means which Congress and its agencies may adopt, if they choose.\" Berman v. Parker, supra, 348 U.S. 33-34.\n\n[36] The housing authority also made loans for up to 90 percent of the purchase price available to the existing tenants. Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra, 467 U.S. 234.\n\n[37] In taking a broad, purposive approach to public use, the United States Supreme Court further emphasized that \"[t]he mere fact that property taken outright by eminent domain is transferred in the first instance to private beneficiaries does not condemn that taking as having only a private purpose. . . . The [Land Reform] Act advances its purposes without the State's taking actual possession of the land. In such cases, government does not itself have to use property to legitimate the taking; it is only the taking's purpose, and not its mechanics, that must pass scrutiny under the Public Use Clause.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra, 467 U.S. 243-44.\n\n[38] The court also noted that whether the act is successful in solving Hawaii's land problems is irrelevant to whether it was passed in furtherance of a valid public purpose.Hawaii Housing Authority v. Midkiff, supra, 467 U.S. 242 (\"Of course, this [Land Reform] Act, like any other, may not be successful in achieving its intended goals. But whether in fact the provision will accomplish its objectives is not the question: the [constitutional requirement] is satisfied if . . . the . . . [state] Legislature rationally could have believed that the [Act] would promote its objective.\" [Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.]).\n\n[39] The Michigan Supreme Court's decision in Poletown Neighborhood Council is a landmark case in the use of eminent domain. We conclude that it warrants further discussion because it illustrates amply how the use of eminent domain for a development project that benefits a private entity nevertheless can rise to the level of a constitutionally valid public benefit. In that case, General Motors Corporation (General Motors) had informed the city of Detroit that it was going to close its Cadillac plant in three years, at the cost of more than 6000 jobs, and the following \"loss of millions of dollars in real estate and income tax revenues.\" Poletown Neighborhood Council v. Detroit, supra, 410 Mich. 650-51 (Ryan, J., dissenting). General Motors offered to build a new assembly complex in the city, so long as a site suitable with regard to size and transportation access could be located. Id., 638 (Fitzgerald, J., dissenting). The city proposed a number of sites, of which one, the neighborhood in question, met General Motors' specifications. Id., 637 (Fitzgerald, J., dissenting). The plaintiffs, a neighborhood association and various individual residents, brought an action to challenge the project. Id., 628.\n\nThe Michigan court concluded, in a per curiam opinion, that the taking of a residential neighborhood, for the purpose of conveying that property to General Motors for construction of an assembly plant, was public use under the state constitution because of the economic benefits of the jobs and tax revenue that would result from the plant's construction. Id., 633-34. The majority opinion noted that the legislature had stated distinctly, in the state Economic Development Corporations Act, the public purposes of revitalizing the state's economy and alleviating unemployment, and also had authorized municipalities to condemn properties for development as industrial or commercial sites, with subsequent transfer to private users. Id., 630-31.\n\nIndeed, the court framed the issue in the case as \"whether the proposed condemnation is for the primary benefit of the public or the private user.\" Id., 632. The majority deferred to the legislature's determination of economic development as a legitimate public purpose. Id., 633. The court stated \"[w]hen there is . . . public need, [t]he abstract right [of an individual] to make use of his own property in his own way is compelled to yield to the general comfort and protection of community, and to a proper regard to relative rights in others. . . . Eminent domain is an inherent power of the sovereign of the same nature as, albeit more severe than, the power to regulate the use of land through zoning or the prohibition of public nuisances.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 633-34. The court then noted that the economic benefits to the city of the condemnation are \"clear and significant.\" Id., 634. The court stated: \"The power of eminent domain is to be used in this instance primarily to accomplish the essential public purposes of alleviating unemployment and revitalizing the economic base of the community. The benefit to a private interest is merely incidental.\" Id.\n\nThe majority, however, limited the impact of its holding. The court stated: \"Our determination that this project falls within the public purpose, as stated by the [l]egislature, does not mean that every condemnation proposed by an economic development corporation will meet with similar acceptance simply because it may provide some jobs or add to the industrial or commercial base. If the public benefit was not so clear and significant, we would hesitate to sanction approval of such a project. . . . Where, as here, the condemnation power is exercised in a way that benefits specific and identifiable private interests, a court inspects with heightened scrutiny the claim that the public interest is the predominant interest being advanced. Such public benefit cannot be speculative or marginal but must be clear and significant . . . .\" (Emphasis added.) Id., 634-35.\n\nThere were two dissenting opinions in Poletown Neighborhood Council. The dissenting opinions, by Justices Fitzgerald and Ryan, both criticized the degree of deference to the legislative public use determination and distinguished economic development from blight clearance. Id., 639, 643 (Fitzgerald, J., dissenting); id., 665, 673 (Ryan, J., dissenting). The dissenters also criticized what they deemed to be incidental public benefit, as compared to the direct benefit to General Motors from the new plant. Id., 641 (Fitzgerald, J., dissenting); id., 672 (Ryan, J., dissenting).\n\nPoletown Neighborhood Council informs, but does not dictate, our decision in the present case. Specifically, we decline to follow the Michigan court's holding that when \"the condemnation power is exercised in a way that benefits specific and identifiable private interests, a court inspects with heightened scrutiny the claim that the public interest is the predominant interest being advanced.\" Id., 634-35. Indeed, we conclude that the application of a \"heightened scrutiny\" standard; id., 635; is inconsistent with our well established approach of deference to legislative determinations of public use.\n\n[40] We note that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in Armendariz v. Penman, supra, 75 F.3d 1320-21, is a significant example of judicial intervention into an alleged governmental abuse of property rights by agents of the city's executive branch. In Armendariz, city agents had conducted multiple housing code enforcement sweeps in an area of the city with low income housing owned by the plaintiffs. Id., 1313. The plaintiffs alleged that \"city officials conducted the sweeps to enable a commercial developer to acquire contiguous property in [the neighborhood] on the cheap, bulldoze the low-income housing units, and replace them with a planned shopping center. According to the plaintiffs, the [c]ity effectuated these purposes by `faking' the existence of serious housing code violations purportedly discovered on the plaintiffs' properties during the sweeps in order to invoke the [c]ity building official's emergency powers to evict the plaintiffs' tenants and revoke the plaintiffs' business licenses and certificates of occupancy.\" Id., 1315.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit concluded that the plaintiffs had stated a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, because \"[i]f the plaintiffs can prove their allegations, the defendants' actions would constitute a taking of the property. Such a taking, if the allegations are true, would seem not to have been for a `public use' as the Fifth Amendment requires but rather for the use of another private person, the shopping-center developer.\" Id., 1321. Significantly, however, the court stated in dicta that \"[i]f the city council . . . had by ordinance declared that a shopping center on the plaintiffs' property would serve a public use by, for example, increasing legitimate business traffic in the area and providing jobs for neighborhood residents, the city might have been able to acquire [the] plaintiffs' property through the payment of just compensation, under the power of eminent domain.\" Id.\n\nThe court emphasized, however, that \"what [the] plaintiffs allege here is an uncompensated taking through a raw misuse of government power. If the allegations are true, the only determination that could possibly have been made that a shopping center on the plaintiffs' land was a `public use' would have been a secret determination by the defendants as executive-branch officials of the city or as individuals using the cloak of their official positions to effect their private ends. Thus, the usual extreme deference that courts owe to legislative determinations of public use . . . is not appropriate here.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Id.\n\n[41] The leading treatise on eminent domain states that there are two competing definitions of the term \"public use\"\u2014a \"narrow\" definition and a \"broad\" definition. 2A P. Nichols, Eminent Domain (3d Ed. Rev. 2003, J. Sackman ed.) \u00a7 7.02[2] through [7], pp. 7-26 through 7-37. The \"broad\" definition provides that \" `public use' means `public advantage.' Any eminent domain action which tends to enlarge resources, increase industrial energies, or promote the productive power of any considerable number of inhabitants of a state or community manifestly contributes to the general welfare and prosperity of the whole community and thus constitutes a valid public use. Under this view of `public use,' it has been held that the scope of eminent domain is both `coterminous with the scope of the sovereign's police powers,' as well as its constitutional taxing authority.\" Id., \u00a7 7.02[3], pp. 7-29 through 7-32.\n\nIn contrast, under the \"narrow\" definition, \"to make a use public means that the property acquired by eminent domain must actually be used by the public or that the public must have the opportunity to use the property taken.\" Id., \u00a7 7.02[2], p. 7-26. The treatise states that the \"broad\" view of eminent domain generally has gained greater acceptance among the federal and state courts; id., \u00a7 7.02[5], pp. 7-35 through 7-36; but that neither definition comprehensively can explain all eminent domain public use holdings; id., \u00a7 7.02[6] and [7], pp. 7-36 through 7-37; concluding that \"[f]urther efforts at providing a precise definition of `public use' are doomed to fail, and many courts have recognized this . . . .\" Id., \u00a7 7.02[7], p. 7-37.\n\n[42] See 2A P. Nichols, Eminent Domain (3d Ed. Rev. 2003, J. Sackman ed.) \u00a7 7.02[2], pp. 7-26 through 7-29; see also footnote 41 of this opinion.\n\n[43] Indeed, the Washington Supreme Court expressly has stated that the courts of its state \"have provided a more restrictive interpretation of public use\" than have the federal courts. Manufactured Housing Communities of Washington v. State, 142 Wash. 2d 347, 359-60, 13 P.3d 183 (2000) (regulatory taking); see also Hogue v. Port of Seattle, 54 Wash. 2d 799, 827-29, 341 P.2d 171 (1959) (utilizing narrow definition of state public use clause to strike statute allowing eminent domain for industrial development).\n\n[44] In the condemnation action, the trial court heard testimony about the positive public safety impact that the expanded parking would have on severe highway traffic generated by the racetrack, as well as on the benefits that continued racetrack expansion would bring to the region. Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental, LLC, supra, 199 Ill. 2d 232-34. The trial court granted the condemnation petition and ordered compensation paid to the defendant; as soon as title vested in the plaintiff, it conveyed the property to the racetrack. Id., 234.\n\n[45] Indeed, the Illinois Supreme Court rejected the plaintiff's contention that it is the purpose of the taking alone that controls, noting that \"[i]n its wisdom, the legislature has given [the plaintiff] the authority to use eminent domain power to encourage private enterprise and become involved in commercial projects that may benefit a specific region of this state. While we do not question the legislature's discretion in allowing for the exercise of eminent domain power, the government does not have unlimited power to redefine property rights. . . . The power of eminent domain is to be exercised with restraint, not abandon.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental, LLC, supra, 199 Ill. 2d 242.\n\n[46] The court stated that \"[i]t appears [the plaintiff's] true intentions were to act as a default broker of land for [the racetrack's] proposed parking plan.\" Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental, LLC, supra, 199 Ill. 2d 241. The court also dismissed claims of resulting economic benefits as mere \"trickle-down\" of the racetrack's revenues, stating that \"revenue expansion alone does not justify an improper and unacceptable expansion of the eminent domain power of the government. Using the power of the government for purely private purposes to allow [the racetrack] to avoid the open real estate market and expand its facilities in a more cost-efficient manner, and thus maximizing corporate profits, is a misuse of the power entrusted by the public.\" Id.\n\n[47] The opinion in Southwestern Illinois Development Authority v. National City Environmental, LLC, supra, 199 Ill. 2d 254, also included a spirited dissent by Justice Freeman, who stated that \"[c]ontrary to the holdings of Hawaii Housing Authority and Berman, the majority gives little deference to the legislature's public use determination. Further, the majority engrafts upon Hawaii Housing Authority and Berman a requirement that property taken by eminent domain be put into use for the public, a proposition specifically rejected by the Court in Hawaii Housing Authority. . . . Today's opinion is not an accurate rendition of the holdings of Hawaii Housing Authority and Berman and of the principles of law involved in this area.\" (Citation omitted.)\n\nJustice Freeman also supplied a rendition of the facts that he concluded demonstrated the economic benefits of the racetrack and its proposed expansion; id., 243-53 (Freeman, J., dissenting); and noted what he considered an extreme lack of deference by the majority to \"the legislative findings regarding the need to alleviate certain economic, housing and other conditions in the southwestern part of this state . . . [and] that alleviation of these conditions furthers certain public purposes.\" Id., 261-62 (Freeman, J., dissenting). Ultimately, Justice Freeman concluded in his dissent that \"the majority commits great disservice to the State of Illinois and its citizens in engrafting upon the public use doctrine the requirement that property taken by eminent domain must be accessible to the general public as of right. This requirement is the death of social legislation in furtherance of economic development and revitalization.\" (Emphasis added.) Id., 268.\n\n[48] See also W. Pritchett, \"The `Public Menace' of Blight: Urban Renewal and the Private Uses of Eminent Domain,\" 21 Yale L. & Policy Rev. 1, 7 (2003) (examining \"how the interaction of renewal advocates and the courts changed legal conceptions of property in the middle of the twentieth century\"); J. Klemetsrud, note, \"The Use of Eminent Domain for Economic Development,\" 75 N.D. L. Rev. 783, 813 (1999) (urging, in wake of Poletown Neighborhood Council, that the \"courts make a more meaningful examination [of] the nature of the proposed condemnation\" in economic development eminent domain cases); L. Mansnerus, note, \"Public Use, Private Use, and Judicial Review in Eminent Domain,\" 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 409, 411 (1983) (advocating for increased judicial review of public use determinations in public/private takings); D. Werner, note, \"The Public Use Clause, Common Sense and Takings,\" 10 B.U. Pub. Int. L.J. 335, 358 (2001) (\"Due to the current state of public use doctrine, the property of minority landowners is insecure. For that matter, any homeowner or small business owner who lacks the political clout to dissuade the government from taking his home or business is at risk.\").\n\n[49] Moreover, we note that the use of the eminent domain power for economic development certainly is not without support in the academic community. See, e.g., M. Harrington, \"`Public Use' and the Original Understanding of the So-Called `Takings' Clause,\" 53 Hastings L.J. 1245, 1249 (2002) (arguing \"that attempts to craft devices to encourage judicial oversight of legislative takings are without warrant in the historical record . . . [and] the term `public use' as used in the Fifth Amendment was meant to be descriptive, rather than proscriptive\"); T. Merrill, \"The Economics of Public Use,\" 72 Cornell L. Rev. 61, 65 (1986) (discussing economics of and proposing models of judicial review of public use determinations); T. Benedict, note, \"The Public-Use Requirement in Washington After State ex. rel. Washington State Convention & Trade Center v. Evans,\" 75 Wash. L. Rev. 225, 226 (2000) (noting confusing array of standards for determining public use and advocating for application of broader public purpose standard).\n\n[50] We note that the plaintiffs claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the parcel 3 condemnations promote sufficient public benefit to be considered in furtherance of the economic development that constitutes the public use in the present case. The plaintiffs also claim that the trial court correctly concluded that the parcel 4A condemnations do not promote sufficient public benefit to be considered in furtherance of the public use. The defendants contend, in response, that the court should not engage in a parcel-by-parcel analysis, and should consider the significant tax and employment economic benefits resulting from the development plan as a whole.\n\nWe decline to address the plaintiffs' parcel-specific claims in this context because an appropriate public use analysis necessarily requires evaluation of the development plan as a whole\u2014the end result of the sum of all of its parts. Cf. Broadriver, Inc. v. Stamford, 158 Conn. 521, 534, 265 A.2d 75 (1969) (\"[a]lthough the plaintiff's concern is for its own parcel within the redevelopment area, the commission's responsibility was to consider conditions existing in the entire area including such matters as street layouts and the relation and significance of the plaintiff's property to the entire area\"), cert. denied, 398 U.S. 938, 90 S. Ct. 184, 26 L. Ed. 2d 270 (1970); Pet Car Products, Inc. v. Barnett, 150 Conn. 42, 52, 184 A.2d 797 (1962) (for urban renewal, \"[t]he plaintiff misconceives the agency's responsibility to consider the condition obtaining in the entire area rather than the condition of the individual property\"). We will, however, address the plaintiffs' parcel-specific claims in the related context of reasonable necessity; that is, whether the taking of the plaintiffs' property was reasonably necessary to achieve the public purpose of the development plan. See, e.g., Pequonnock Yacht Club, Inc. v. Bridgeport, supra, 259 Conn. 600-604; see parts IV and VI of this opinion.\n\n[51] The term \"requirements\" was contained in a December, 1997 letter from Claire Gaudiani, the president of the development corporation, to George Milne, the president of Pfizer's research division. In this letter, Gaudiani had stated that the development corporation was \"pleased to make the commitments outlined below to enable you to decide to construct a Pfizer Central Research Facility in New London.\" The letter describes the efforts to \"design a land plan to ensure that the new Pfizer facility will be the centerpiece of a concentrated reuse of the area surrounding the former New London Mills.\" It informs Milne that \"[i]n addition to your facility, the project includes the development of the state's fourth biotechnology incubator, the refurbishment of historic Fort Trumbull, the reuse of the vacant Naval Undersea Warfare Center and the development of mixed retail and residential space that will be fully integrated into the surrounding neighborhoods of the city of New London. In order to achieve these goals, it will be necessary to relocate the Calamari Bros. scrap dealer, upgrade utilities and infrastructure, and acquire a number of surrounding properties.\" The conclusion of the letter states that the development corporation \"will work with you to refine this proposal to meet Pfizer's requirements.\" As the trial court correctly points out, in the letter \"[n]o mention is made of a hotel or office buildings . . . or any direct link between new residential construction and any need by Pfizer executives for upscale housing.\"\n\n[52] Indeed, Hicks testified that \"[t]he major gist of the [development corporation's] goals were to expand upon the Pfizer facilities. That is, to have not just Pfizer come in, but other ancillary economic benefits accrue before that. I mean, can you multiply it? Pfizer, with any large company, attracts other users, attracts people to provide them services. If you do what's commonly referred to as an economic analysis, cluster analysis, there's groups of firms and companies that relate to companies that also bring employment. So one of the major goals was to expand upon Pfizer for the benefit of citizens of New London to improve the tax base, [provide] employment opportunity. . . . If you've got something that very rarely happens, in my experience, in an urban area, a major corporation moving a lot of jobs, high-paying jobs, it gives you really good opportunities to take advantage of that and expand some of the things that you see in your community.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n[53] We note that, during the testimony of William Longa, senior corporate counsel for Pfizer, the trial court wondered how Pfizer could move to the city without already having had the hotel and housing plans in place. In response to this, Longa testified that there were sufficient hotels and housing in the general area that already served its facility in nearby Groton. The Groton facility did not have housing and hotels immediately adjacent. Longa, however, testified that the hotels and housing are a significant part of ensuring that the city, rather than just the outlying towns, could take advantage of Pfizer's relocation.\n\n[54] The trial court also noted the testimony of James Mahoney, executive director of the development corporation from 1992 to 1998. Mahoney testified that the development corporation interacted with Pfizer during the environmental impact evaluation process, as part of a market analysis intended to determine appropriate uses for the development plan area. Pfizer did at this time inform them of the demand for hotel, conference and residential space that its presence would create.\n\n[55] The e-mail indicated that the state did not want to locate new residences in a floodplain area, or condemn existing residential areas to replace them with more upscale housing. The e-mail did not mention office space or the need to clear the entire Fort Trumbull area of existing residences and businesses, which were the needs that precipitated the need for the condemnations in the present case.\n\n[56] The trial also court quoted the proposition in Katz v. Brandon, supra, 156 Conn. 533, that \"[i]n this day of keen competition to attract industry and business to a state or to a particular locality, public officials are expected to cooperate in helping an industry to locate in their community. They must be at all times alert in providing for future as well as present needs.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n\n[57] The trial court was not, and we are not, blind to the social costs of the development plan in the present case. In the words of the trial court: \"An old New London neighborhood with all of its memories, in effect, has been destroyed. People like the plaintiffs have been or might yet be removed from homes they love and in some cases from homes where their families have lived for generations.\"\n\n[58] We take the opportunity, however, to state that the trial court's social costs analysis was an improper, but in this case, harmless, supplantation of a decision-making function better suited to legislative bodies. Although the courts remain charged with determining whether the facts and circumstances of the particular case reveal that the primary purpose of the taking is to benefit the public, the balancing of the benefits and social costs of a particular project is uniquely a legislative function.\n\n[59] Indeed, Wilmington Parking Authority v. Land With Improvements, supra, 521 A.2d 232-34, is noteworthy as another example of the role of judicial review in curtailing the abusive use of the power of eminent domain; it is an excellent illustration of the line between public and private takings. In that case, a parking authority attempted to take land ostensibly for garage construction, but then intended to transfer it to a neighboring newspaper company. Id., 229. The newspaper company would use the land for facility expansion, but the parking authority would pay the newspaper company for the air rights over the land, and construct a garage there. Id. The trial court blocked the parking authority's use of eminent domain for this purpose. Id., 230.\n\nOn appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court concluded that the trial court did not commit clear error when it concluded that the parking authority acted beyond its statutory authorization because \"the primary purpose of the project was to retain [a newspaper company] as a corporate citizen rather than to provide the public with parking facilities.\" Id., 234. The court also considered that other parking authority actions would dispose of 500 public parking spaces, offsetting the projected gain of 950 new spaces, of which 10 percent were reserved automatically for newspaper company employees. Id.\n\n[60] Cf. Donahue v. Southington, supra, 259 Conn. 795 (in equal protection context, \"the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the government decisionmaker\" [internal quotation marks omitted]); Franklin Furniture Co. v. Bridgeport, 142 Conn. 510, 514-15, 115 A.2d 435 (1955) (\"[w]hile recitals of fact in a legislative act may not be conclusive, a decent respect for a coordinate department of the government requires the courts to treat them as true until the contrary appears\").\n\n[61] The trial court determined that the taking of parcel 4A was not reasonably necessary, and therefore only discussed the reasonable assurances of future public use for parcel 3. Accordingly, on appeal the plaintiffs claimed only that parcel 3 lacked reasonable assurances of future public use. In response to the defendants' cross-appeal, however, the plaintiffs expanded their argument to include parcel 4A and, therefore, we will address them together.\n\n[62] The dissent claims that this court, sub silentio, is overruling the holdings of Connecticut College v. Calvert, 87 Conn. 421, 88 A. 633 (1913), and Evergreen Cemetery Assn. v. Beecher, 53 Conn. 551, 5 A. 353 (1886). More specifically, the dissent cites those two cases for the proposition that \"the question whether in any given instance the use is or will be administered as a public or as a private use, is a question which must of necessity be determined by the courts in accordance with the facts of the particular case in hand.\" Connecticut College v. Calvert, supra, 428. Contrary to the dissent's claim, our conclusion in the present case is consistent with the principles set forth in those two cases.\n\nWe disagree with the dissent, however, on the appropriate standard the trial court should apply to the plaintiffs' claim of lack of reasonable assurance of future public use. We conclude that the trial court's factual determination about the statutory and contractual constraints on future public use is subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review. The dissent, to the contrary, proposes a new four step process of review in which one of the steps would require the development corporation to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the specific economic development contemplated by the plan will, in fact, result in a public benefit. This step essentially subjects the plaintiffs' lack of reasonable assurances argument to an evidentiary standard that no other court, or even the plaintiffs themselves, has set forth. Furthermore, this court knows of no other area of the law where we, or any other courts, have imposed a clear and convincing standard on a prediction of future events. As the dissent itself makes clear, even in other civil cases involving property disputes, the clear and convincing standard is reserved for past events, and not for predictions of future events. See, e.g., Wildwood Associates, Ltd. v. Esposito, 211 Conn. 36, 42, 557 A.2d 1241 (1989) (clear and convincing evidence required to prove elements of adverse possession claim). Additionally, it is hard for this court to imagine how any plan, proposed and adopted according to the provisions of chapter 132 of the General Statutes, would be able to prove that the economic development will, in fact, occur in the future. Thus, there is simply no basis, in reason, precedent, policy or practicality for the dissent's proffered standard.\n\n[63] The trial court also referred to its findings on the delegation issue; see part III of this opinion; wherein the court concluded that pursuant to chapter 132 of the General Statutes, there is substantial state oversight of the operations of the development corporation with respect to the implementation of the development plan. Specifically, the court discussed \u00a7 8-189 (development plan must conform to department regulations), General Statutes \u00a7 8-190 (department may make planning grants and advise development agency), General Statutes \u00a7 8-191 (department must approve final development plan if state grants have been made), General Statutes \u00a7 8-193 (a) (if state grants have been made, department and city must approve land transfers by sale or lease in accordance with plan), and General Statutes \u00a7 8-200 (a) (\"substantial\" changes to development plan require approval in same manner as original plan). In discussing the delegation issue, the trial court noted that the state is a signatory to the development agreement, and it concluded that it \"strain[ed] credulity to believe that the state . . . will not (1) have the wherewithal to control the activities of the [development corporation] to a sufficient degree so as not to allow that agency to be characterized as being able to act according to its own `will and caprice'; and will not (2) have the ability to ensure through the development agreement that the developer and the [development corporation] will seek to meet the goals and purposes of the [development plan], which the commissioner had to approve in the first place . . . .\"\n\n[64] The development plan provides, in addition to an antidiscrimination clause, that the redeveloper must \"[agree] for itself and its successors and assigns as successors in interest to the parcel, or any part thereof, that the deed conveying the Parcel shall contain language covenanting on the part of Redeveloper and its successors and assigns that:\"The Parcel shall be devoted principally to the uses contemplated by the Plan, and shall not be used or devoted for any other purpose, or contrary to any of the limitations or requirements of said Plan. All improvements made pursuant to the Plan and this Agreement shall be used in accordance with the Plan unless prior written consent is given by the [development corporation] and [department] for a different use;\n\nThe Parcel shall not be sold, leased, or otherwise disposed of for the purposes of speculation.(Emphasis added.)\n\n[65] Although the present case provides no occasion for a complete exploration of the mechanisms for judicial enforcement of the development plan under chapter 132 of the General Statutes, it is elementary that the terms of the development plan, like any other \"legal obligation may, of course, be dishonored. That is one reason why courts exist.\" Northeastern Gas Transmission Co. v. Collins, supra, 138 Conn. 589. Although we need not address its precise workings, there is \"ample judicial machinery\"; id.; available for enforcement of the development agreement and the development plan, in the event of breach of their terms by either the development corporation or private developers.\n\n[66] Indeed, the court distinguished the project from \"redevelopment projects . . . with the public agency identifying and putting together an assemblage of land in order to attract a developer\" because all of the other land already was owned by the existing neighboring hotel and casino. Casino Reinvestment Development Authority v. Banin, supra, 320 N.J. Super. 355.\n\n[67] The court stated that, in Casino Reinvestment Development Authority v. Banin, supra, 320 N.J. Super. 357, \"a public agency, through the power of eminent domain, if successful, will have effectively created an assemblage of land for future development by Trump under circumstances where [the casino authority] could not do so under [the enabling statute] and where Trump is unable or unwilling to do so itself on the open market.\"\n\n[68] Moreover, we also reiterate our previous conclusion that the public use or purpose in the present case is, in the first instance, the plan to induce the significant economic growth projected as a result of private sector development spurred by the terms of the development plan. As the defendants note correctly, such growth necessarily requires time to occur.\n\n[69] General Statutes \u00a7 8-188 provides: \"Any municipality which has a planning commission is authorized, by vote of its legislative body, to designate the economic development commission or the redevelopment agency of such municipality or a nonprofit development corporation as its development agency and exercise through such agency the powers granted under this chapter, except that the Quinnipiac Valley Development Corporation, organized and existing by virtue of the provisions of number 625 of the special acts of 1957, may be designated as a development agency, for the purposes of this chapter, to act as such within the geographical area specified in section 2 of said special act. Any municipality may, with the approval of the commissioner, designate a separate economic development commission, redevelopment agency or nonprofit development corporation as its development agency for each development project undertaken by the municipality pursuant to this chapter.\"\n\n[70] The development plan, as approved by the city council prior to its authorization of the development corporation to use eminent domain, expressly listed those properties needed for its implementation.\n\n[71] The January, 2000 resolution specifically stated that \"the New London City Council hereby resolves: (1) That the [development plan] is hereby approved . . . .(6) That to carry out and administer the project, public action under Chapters 130, 132 and 588 (l) of the Connecticut General Statutes as amended is required; and, for the purposes of carrying out this project, that the New London City Council approves and bestows upon the [development corporation] all rights and powers that are permitted to accrue to a development agency or implementing agency under Chapters 130, 132, and 588 (l) of the Connecticut General Statutes as amended, including the power of eminent domain with the project area in the name of the City of New London per Chapter 130, Section 8-128, and Chapter 132, Section 8-193.[72] The October, 2000, development corporation resolution provided in relevant part: \"WHEREAS, the New London City Council has designated the [development corporation], a nonprofit development corporation, as its development agency pursuant to the Connecticut General Statutes, andWHEREAS, the [development corporation] has prepared a project plan for [development plan] Area pursuant to Section 8-189 of the Connecticut General Statutes, and\n\nWHEREAS, the project plan for the [development plan] Area has been duly approved and adopted pursuant to Section 8-191 of the Connecticut General Statutes, and\n\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to acquire certain properties located in the [development plan] Area of [the city] in order to carry out and administer said project plan, and\n\nWHEREAS, pursuant to Section 8-193 of the Connecticut General Statutes the [development corporation] has the approval of the New London City Council to acquire by eminent domain properties within the [development plan] Area.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS RESOLVED that the [development corporation], in the name of the [city], acquire certain properties located in the [development plan] Area of [the city] through the exercise of the power of eminent domain as granted to it under Chapter 132 of the Connecticut General Statutes. Said properties are more particularly described . . . .\n\nIT IS FURTHER RESOLVED, that the [development corporation] take such steps as are necessary to effectuate such acquisition in the manner provided in Sections 8-128 through 8-133 of the Connecticut General Statutes.[73] The plaintiffs also had argued in the trial court that the development corporation was entirely a private entity not subject to control by the state or city governments, and that the benefits of its actions accrued wholly to private parties, such as Corcoran Jennison. The trial court rejected these arguments after reviewing the extensive statutory framework under chapter 132 of the General Statutes governing the development corporation's use of eminent domain. See footnote 63 of this opinion. On appeal, the plaintiffs challenge only the trial court's constitutional analysis.\n\n[74] In Evergreen Cemetery Assn. v. Beecher, supra, 53 Conn. 552, this court acknowledged the public necessity of the proper burial of the dead, as a matter of \"[t]he safety of the living . . . .\" The court also noted that the legislature provided for associations to exist with power to provide, maintain and protect public burial places, and that \"[t]he use of land by them for this purpose does not cease to be a public use because they require varying sums for rights to bury in different localities; not even if the cost of the right is the practical exclusion of some.\" Id., 553.\n\nThe court also noted that the cemetery association was a private facility not necessarily open to all, a category of cemetery whose \"proprietors . . . cannot take land for such continued private use by right of eminent domain.\" Id. It, therefore, was distinguishable from public access cemeteries, as well as privately operated mills, toll roads and bridges, which, while they benefit their private operators, \"[remain] a public use as long as all persons have the same measure of right for the same measure of money.\" Id. The court, therefore, denied the cemetery association's petition to take land by eminent domain. Id.\n\n[75] The power of eminent domain, which emanates from the state legislature; see, e.g., Northeastern Gas Transmission Co. v. Collins, supra, 138 Conn. 586-87; initially had been granted to the city through chapter 132 of the General Statutes. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-186, 8-193 (a) and 8-199. The plaintiffs did not challenge this initial grant to the city, only the subsequent grant from the city to the development corporation.\n\n[76] Goebel testified that Corcoran Jennison will select the tenants for the office buildings; the development corporation has no say over who the tenants will be.\n\n[77] We note that the parties dispute whether an agency relationship exists between the development corporation and the city, and that the plaintiffs cite several instances of the development corporation being less responsive to the inquiries of the city than an agent customarily should be to the questions of a principal. The trial court, however, concluded that an agency relationship did in fact exist between the city and the development corporation, as well as the development corporation and the department. Nevertheless, in light of our resolution of the plaintiffs' claim by a straightforward application of the rule set forth in Carofano and Connecticut College, we note that the existence of an agency relationship is immaterial to the resolution of this appeal.\n\n[78] The trial court acknowledged that Mullin \"is a highly qualified and obviously knowledgeable individual.\" His qualifications included numerous fellowships, teaching positions, academic publication, military experience and government planning work.\n\n[79] Mullin also testified that, in his opinion, prospective purchasers of single-family detached homes would not necessarily \"be more inclined to look in the suburbs or someplace other than immediately adjacent to a [sewage] treatment plant.\"\n\n[80] Hicks has had experience in planning waterfront development projects in other cities, including Lewiston, Maine, and Fall River, Massachusetts. He also has governmental and academic experience in addition to his private sector work. Hicks also has worked as a developer, in addition to planning.\n\n[81] In preparing the development plan, RKG Associates also worked on the statutorily required environmental impact evaluation, which described the city in great detail. Hicks testified that the environmental impact evaluation reflected the city's declining population, housing stagnation and rising unemployment, particularly in light of the closing of the United States Naval Undersea Warfare Center.\n\n[82] Specifically, Hicks testified as follows: \"What they finally adopted was they would get a private sector develop[er] to come in. What that basically means is a common redevelopment approach as you prepare the site. You give them raw land with the necessary infrastructure, and the developer makes an investment. This site, though, has a lot of risk. It's got hazardous waste. It's got [geographic] constrainment. It's got a lot of regulations dealing with it, and it's in an urban setting. That's not the most attractive for investment, and that's the reality you have to face. There's not a lot of people coming and investing in [the city]. So if you're [going to] attract a private developer to this type of site setting, you've got to try to minimize as much uncertainty as much as possible. Most developers are good at understanding risks, but not uncertainty. If you said we'll give you something that looks like a spotted leopard\u2014\n\nQ. What's the spotted leopard?\n\nA. It's where a leopard has spots, spots are things that stay the same and you've got to work around them. Spotted leopard is just a way to refer at the configuration of land uses. If you're [going to] attract developers, if you're [going to] put out what you call requests for proposals and get them interested in the site, and after they overcome all the inherent problems with redevelopment, say to them also, well, you've got to work around this contingency . . . you greatly diminish your ability to finding competent capable people to come in. You take things that would possibly [be] risk and turn them into uncertainty. Developers operate with very short time frame financial conditions, and it was our recommendation that because the housing wasn't adaptable and a long-term use to the office related things, and that three, four kinds of the hodgepodge of certain things that we recommended, that most of those facilities be demolished.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n[83] The parties had stipulated to the admission into evidence of the deposition of Jones.\n\n[84] Jones testified that public-private partnerships frequently have design review processes wherein the agency that selected the developer has a role in reviewing the developer's site plan. Jones and Goebel testified that, in the present case, the development corporation and the department would be the reviewing agencies, and that they had in fact engaged in informal reviews of Corcoran Jennison's plans. Jones also testified, however, that the formal process would occur pursuant to the development agreement, which had not yet been finalized.\n\n[85] Jones testified that it is important for Corcoran Jennison to have a full site because \"[f]irst of all to be able to develop the amount of parking needed for economic feasibility, and also . . . that the grading issues in . . . [p]arcel 3 are very complicated and the retention of isolated properties within that area could make it very difficult to develop this sort of property.\"\n\n[86] The trial court also heard the testimony of Goebel, who stated that retention of the plaintiffs' homes in parcel 3 did not conform with the development plan. He also described the process by which the present development plan was chosen, and eventually approved by the city, development corporation and department, and the fact that it was a composite of six alternate plans. See footnote 6 of this opinion. Goebel also stated that the development corporation's decision to utilize the development plan at issue was informed by public comments during the selection process.\n\n[87] General Statutes \u00a7 8-125 (b) provides: \"`Redevelopment area' means an area within the state which is deteriorated, deteriorating, substandard or detrimental to the safety, health, morals or welfare of the community. An area may consist partly or wholly of vacant or unimproved land or of land with structures and improvements thereon, and may include structures not in themselves substandard or insanitary which are found to be essential to complete an adequate unit of development, if the redevelopment area is deteriorated, deteriorating, substandard or detrimental. An area may include properties not contiguous to each other. An area may include all or part of the territorial limits of any fire district, sewer district, fire and sewer district, lighting district, village, beach or improvement association or any other district or association, wholly within a town and having the power to make appropriations or to levy taxes, whether or not such entity is chartered by the General Assembly . . . .\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n[88] Hyde testified that when the United States Naval Undersea Warfare Center was in the city, \"spin-off development\" occurred as satellite companies opened up in the city to service it. He testified that these satellite companies then followed the sound lab to Newport, Rhode Island, when it relocated there. Hyde stated that he would expect similar spin-off development in the city as a result of Pfizer, although he personally was unsure about the kind of outside contractors with whom Pfizer interacts.\n\n[89] Additionally, in support of their claim that courts reject projects that are on uncertain timetables, the plaintiffs point us to San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. Lux Land Co., 194 Cal. App. 2d 472, 479-80, 14 Cal. Rptr. 899 (1961), State v. 0.62033 Acres of Land, 49 Del. 174, 179-80, 112 A.2d 857 (1955), and Meyer v. Northern Indiana Public Service Co., 254 Ind. 112, 113-15, 258 N.E.2d 57 (1970), superseded on other grounds, 259 Ind. 408, 287 N.E.2d 882 (1972). Their reliance on these cases is misplaced because of the considered effort that went into the development plan in the present case, and the fact that the marketing studies and other evidence have indicated a foreseeable need for office space as a result of the new Pfizer facility. In contrast, we note that the California court concluded that, on the facts of that case, \"the taking of the defendants' property by the plaintiff [power company] for [gas and telephone lines] is not necessary . . . because the plaintiff has no present or prospective plans to use it for that purpose.\" San Diego Gas & Electric Co. v. Lux Land Co., supra, 194 Cal. App. 2d 481. Similarly, the Indiana court rejected the electric company's attempt to maintain a 200 foot right-of-way for electric lines when the company had admitted that all it needed for the near future was the 150 feet that they already had; there was no evidence of plans that would require more room. Meyer v. Northern Indiana Public Service Co., supra, 254 Ind. 115. Moreover, the Delaware court concluded that the taking for highway construction was impermissible when no present or future need had been established, and the department of transportation had taken \"no official action\" toward the highway's construction. State v. 0.62033 Acres of Land, supra, 49 Del. 179-80. Accordingly, these cases are distinguishable from the present case wherein a carefully considered projection of need, and plans for achieving it, were in place prior to the taking.\n\n[90] Article first, \u00a7 20, of the constitution of Connecticut provides in relevant part: \"No person shall be denied the equal protection of the law . . . .\"\n\n[91] The fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, \u00a7 1, provides in relevant part: \"No State shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\n[92] In their brief, the plaintiffs do not \"provide an independent analysis asserting the existence of greater protection under the state constitutional provision than its federal counterpart . . . [and] we will not of our own initiative address that question. . . . Accordingly, the federal equal protection standard is considered prevailing for the purposes of our review of both the state and federal equal protection claims in this case.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Donahue v. Southington, supra, 259 Conn. 794 n.7.\n\n[93] Membership in the club is limited to descendants of people who emigrated from a certain region in Italy. The club holds dinners for its members; they may bring guests to the dinners.\n\n[94] In so concluding, the trial court rejected the defendants' contention that the club and the plaintiffs were not similarly situated because the club's building was a commercial property while the plaintiffs' homes were residential. The court expressly noted that the club was not commercial property. The trial court, however, also rejected the plaintiffs' contention that they were similarly situated because both were slated for acquisition and demolition under the development plan and wanted to stay, but that the club's building was spared. The court concluded that this was more \"[a] statement of the problem, not the solution.\"\n\n[95] The plaintiffs had claimed in the trial court that the taking implicated a fundamental right to property ownership, and that the development corporation's decision thus was subject to the strict scrutiny standard of review. The trial court concluded that the right to property ownership was not fundamental for equal protection purposes and, therefore, the development corporation's action was subject only to the rational basis standard of review. On appeal, the plaintiffs do not contest the trial court's decision to use the rational basis standard of review.\n\n[96] Specifically, the trial court noted the testimony of Mahoney and James Dunn, the director of real estate acquisition for the development corporation, to the effect that condemnation of the club and a nearby church could be politically difficult. Nevertheless, the trial court concluded that in January, 2000, the city council approved the development plan with the club condemnation intact. The trial court also noted the testimony of Goebel and Damon Hemmerdinger, a consultant to, and former director of real estate development for the development corporation, to the effect that, even after the city had approved the development plan, the development corporation, in response to public comments, continued to consider not demolishing other properties in addition to the club.\n\nThe trial court concluded that the plaintiffs' claim that Milne spoke to the governor about retaining the club was pure speculation, particularly because Milne was never deposed or called to testify, and the development corporation officers were never questioned about their involvement in this conversation. The trial court also noted multiple substantial state expenditures in support of the project, many months before the decision was made to retain the club's building.\n\n[97] See, e.g., State v. Ferguson, 260 Conn. 339, 365-66, 796 A.2d 1118 (2002) (\"[e]ven if we were to assume, without deciding, that the statement had been made with knowledge of its falsity and that this fact should therefore be excised from the affidavit, we conclude that probable cause still existed for the warrant to issue\").\n\n[98] \"[E]qual protection does not just mean treating identically situated persons identically. . . . Moreover, the requirement imposed upon [p]laintiffs claiming an equal protection violation [is that they] identify and relate specific instances where persons situated similarly in all relevant aspects were treated differently . . . .\" (Citation omitted; emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) Thomas v. West Haven, supra, 249 Conn. 402, quoting Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1989); accord Cadlerock Properties Joint Venture, L.P. v.

Entities are \"situated similarly in all relevant aspects\" if \"a prudent person, looking objectively at the incidents, would think them roughly equivalent and the protagonists similarly situated. Much as in the lawyer's art of distinguishing cases, the relevant aspects are those factual elements which determine whether reasoned analogy supports, or demands, a like result. Exact correlation is neither likely nor necessary, but the cases must be fair congeners. In other words, apples should be compared to apples.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College, supra, 19; accord Equus Associates, Ltd. v. Southampton, 37 F. Sup. 2d 582, 599 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (utilizing test); Kirschner v. Zoning Board of Appeals, 924 F. Sup. 385, 392 (E.D.N.Y. 1996) (same).\n\n[99] In Willowbrook v. Olech, supra, 528 U.S. 563, property owners had asked village officials to connect their property to the municipal water supply. The village conditioned the connection on the property owners granting the village a thirty-three foot easement, despite the fact that it had connected other properties to the water supply upon the grant of fifteen foot easements. Id. After a three month delay, the village relented and connected the subject property to the water supply with a fifteen foot easement. Id. Thereafter, the property owners brought an action, contending that their equal protection rights had been violated by the thirty-three foot demand, which they alleged was \"`irrational and wholly arbitrary'\" and the result of ill will by the village toward them because of a prior action between the parties. Id. The District Court dismissed the claim; on appeal, the \"Seventh Circuit reversed, holding that a plaintiff can allege an equal protection violation by asserting that state action was motivated solely by a `spiteful effort to \"get\" him for reasons wholly unrelated to any legitimate state objective.'\" Id., 563-64.\n\nApplying this reasoning, the Supreme Court affirmed the Seventh Circuit's decision and concluded that the property owners' complaint stated a cause of action, stating that the allegations that \"the [v]illage's demand was `irrational and wholly arbitrary' and that the [v]illage ultimately connected [the] property after receiving a clearly adequate [fifteen] foot easement . . . quite apart from the [v]illage's subjective motivation, are sufficient to state a claim for relief under traditional equal protection analysis.\" Id., 565. In so concluding, the court expressly did \"not reach the alternative theory of `subjective ill will' relied on by [the Seventh Circuit].\" Id.\n\n[100] In its memorandum of decision, the trial court expressed its concern that the phrase \"park support\" is vague and undefined. Damon Hemmerdinger, who had been the development corporation's director of real estate development and presently serves as a consultant to the development corporation, called it \"broad\" and \"[not] a statutory term,\" stating that parcel 4A would serve uses such as parking or \"other ancillary uses\" for the park or marina. Indeed, Claire Gaudiani, president of the development corporation, also was not sure of the exact definition of the phrase \"park support.\"\n\nWe note, as did the trial court, that Mullin, the plaintiffs' expert, testified that he had never heard the term before, but understood it to mean \"parking, storage [and] warehousing.\" Mullin also referred to parcel 4A as \"a big nothing,\" but then acknowledged that it could provide parking for both the parcel 4B marina, as well as the state park. He did state that he had insufficient information to estimate the parking demand as a result of those two facilities.\n\n[101] This section of the development plan also states that parcel 4B \"is intended to accommodate a mix of water-dependent uses centered around the rehabilitated Fort Trumbull Marina, which will provide boat slips and upland support. The Marina may be developed as a working marina training center, with facilities designed in conjunction with improvements made to parcel 4A.\"\n\n[102] Gaudiani testified that the museum would not be on the tax rolls, but would provide jobs and generate revenue by attracting thousands of visitors. If built, the museum would preclude the use of parcel 4A for parking.\n\n[103] Goebel also testified that he was hoping for the museum to be located on parcel 4A.\n\n[104] The trial court quoted Krauter v. Lower Big Blue Natural Resources District, supra, 199 Neb. 439, as stating that \"[t]he landowner's right to own, possess, and enjoy his property free from an unlawful and unconstitutional exercise of the sovereign power of eminent domain may best be insured by requiring specific pleadings and proof. We hold that in a condemnation action under the power of eminent domain, the condemn[or] must allege the specific public purposes for which the condemn[or] seeks to acquire and use the property sought to be taken.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n[105] The court in State Highway Commission v. Yost Farm Co., supra, 142 Mont. 243-44, stated: \"In an action to condemn private property for a public use, the question of necessity is one of fact, to be determined as other questions of fact, in view of all the evidence in the case. The evidence should show that the land is reasonably required for the purpose of effecting the object of its condemnation. . . . The question of necessity in a given case involves a consideration of facts which relate to the public and also to the private citizens whose property may be injured. The greatest good on the one hand and the least injury on the other are the questions of fact to be determined in passing upon the question of necessity. . . .\n\n\"The foregoing statutes and cases clearly reflect that under our eminent domain statutory provisions, the trial judge not only has the power to determine the question of necessity, but has been directed to make a finding that the public interest requires the taking of the lands before he has power to issue an order of condemnation.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n\nSimilarly, the court in Krauter v. Lower Big Blue Natural Resources District, supra, 199 Neb. 439, stated that \"[i]n a condemnation case issues as to the amount of property needed and the estate or interest in such property are questions of fact for the court.\" See also footnote 104 of this opinion.\n\n[106] Accordingly, we need not address the plaintiffs' factual contentions in support of the trial court's opinion because they are offered in support of a factual finding that was the product of the application of an improper legal standard.\n\n[107] We also need not address the defendants' other claim in support of their cross appeal, which is that the trial court improperly refused to permit the defendants to take the plaintiffs' properties on parcel 4A for the purpose of roadway and infrastructure improvements.\n\n[108] As the development corporation points out, accomplishment of the development plan's general plan for development requires that the development corporation have flexibility in carrying out the plan. The general plan states that \"[t]he Fort Trumbull [development plan] area shall be developed as a dynamic mixed-use urban district that fully develops the opportunities presented by its waterfront location and its adjacency to the developing regional assets of the Fort Trumbull State Park and the Pfizer [g]lobal [d]evelopment [f]acility. The development of its proposed land uses shall support the formation of a vibrant Waterfront Urban Village, which binds each of its components into a highly cohesive urban district.\n\n\"The integrated nature of the proposed development shall (a) increase public access and use of the waterfront, (b) maintain a community atmosphere, and (c) enhance the location's attractiveness and desirability. The establishment of strong functional, spatial and physical interrelationships between the district's various buildings, streets, public spaces and the waterfront, shall orient the development of each of the proposed land use components.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n[1] It is a fundamental principle of law that the power to appropriate private property for public use is an attribute of sovereignty and essential to the existence of government. . . . It attaches to every man's land and is paramount to his right of ownership. . . . It lies dormant in the state until set in motion by legislative enactment.\" (Citations omitted.) Northeastern Gas Transmission Co. v. Collins, 138 Conn. 582, 586, 87 A.2d 139 (1952).\n\n[2] I disagree in large part with the majority's analysis in part I of its opinion. Any discussion about this issue is unnecessary, however, in light of my conclusion that chapter 132 of the General Statutes applies to nonvacant land.\n\n[3] Although I agree with the majority's conclusion in part V of its opinion, my conclusion that the taking of the plaintiffs' properties is unconstitutional for other reasons is dispositive of the appeal, and, thus, the court need not reach the plaintiffs' equal protection claims.\n\n[4] General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-186 through 8-200b.\n\n[5] The term \"private economic development,\" as used in this opinion, refers to the type of development permitted under chapter 132 of the General Statutes.\n\n[6] In redevelopment projects, it is the elimination of blight, and not the development that follows, that constitutes the public benefit. See generally General Statutes \u00a7 8-124.\n\n[7] The police power has been described as \"extensive, elastic, and constantly evolving to meet new and increasing demands for its exercise for the benefit of society and to promote the general welfare. It embraces the state's power to preserve and to promote the general welfare and it is concerned with whatever affects the peace, security, safety, morals, health, and general welfare of the community . . . .\" 16A Am. Jur. 2d 251, Constitutional Law \u00a7 315 (1998).\n\n[8] Section 12.0 of the development plan provides in relevant part: \"This [development plan] and/or any modification hereof shall be in full force and effect for a period of thirty . . . years from the date of first approval . . . by the City Council of the City of New London. . . .\"\n\n[9] General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-125 through 8-169w.\n\n[10] Pursuant to \u00a7 8-124, those activities include the acquisition of property, the removal of structures, the improvement of sites, the exercise of powers by municipalities, and any assistance offered by any public body.\n\n[11] General Statutes \u00a7 8-187 (10) defines the term \"business purpose\" as \"includ[ing] . . . any commercial, financial or retail enterprise and . . . any enterprise which promotes tourism and any property that produces income.\" This definition does little, however, to illuminate the meaning of \"private economic development\" as that term is used in chapter 132 of the General Statutes.\n\n[12] General Statutes \u00a7 8-200 provides in relevant part: \"(b) If after three years from the date of approval of the development plan the development agency has been unable to transfer by sale or lease at fair market value or fair rental value, as the case may be, the whole or any part of the real property acquired in the project area to any person in accordance with the project plan, and no grant has been made for such project pursuant to section 8-195, the municipality may, by vote of its legislative body, abandon the project plan and such real property may be conveyed free of any restriction, obligation or procedure imposed by the plan but shall be subject to all other local and state laws, ordinances or regulations.\"\n\n[13] The majority's claim that its \"conclusion in the present case is consistent with the principles set forth in [Connecticut College and Evergreen Cemetery Assn.]\"; footnote 62 of the majority opinion; is misplaced. The majority misses the point in concluding \"that the trial court properly determined that there are sufficient statutory and contractual constraints in place to [ensure] that private sector participants will adhere to the provisions of the development plan.\" Part II C of the majority opinion. As I note in this opinion the question is not whether the development plan and the statutes reasonably ensure adherence to the development plan, but, rather, whether \"private sector participants\" are available and willing to develop the property and whether the terms by which they agree to develop the property will result in a public benefit such that the private benefit will be incidental thereto.\n\n[14] In Olmstead, a private party effected the taking; see Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 532 (reporter's case summary); but for a purpose that the court concluded was public. Id., 551.\n\n[15] The court found that Olmstead had leased the mill to his brother-inlaw, Jonathan Camp, Jr., for an indefinite period. Olmstead v. Camp, supra, 33 Conn. 535 (reporter's case summary). The court also found that \"there was no agreement that Camp should do custom grinding for the public, which obligated him to do it; but such had been the practice from the time when the mill was erected, and it was the expectation of the parties to the lease that the practice would be continued.\" Id., 535-36 (reporter's case summary).\n\n[16] Public Acts 1864, c. XXVI, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, codified as amended at General Statutes (1866 Rev.) tit. 1, c. 16, \u00a7 388, provided: \"Sec. 1. That when any person shall desire to set up a water mill on his own land, or upon land of another with his consent, and to erect a dam on the same, for working such mill by water, which dam would flow water on to land belonging to any other person, he may obtain the right to flow said land upon the terms and conditions, and subject to the regulations, hereinafter expressed.\n\n\"Sec. 2. Any person wishing to flow land as aforesaid, if he can not agree with the owner, or owners, as to the damages to be paid, may bring his petition to the superior court for the county where the land to be overflowed, or any part of it, lies, which petition shall contain such a description of the land to be overflowed and of the dam, its location, and proposed height, as that the record will show with certainty the matter that shall be determined, and shall be served on the respondent according to law requiring service of petitioners in such court.\"\n\n[17] The majority's conclusion that there is \"no basis, in reason, precedent, policy or practicality\" for judicial review to determine whether the proposed economic development will, in fact, occur; footnote 62 of the majority opinion; reflects a complete misunderstanding of the law of this and other jurisdictions. See part II B of this opinion; see also Walker v. Shasta Power Co., supra, 160 F. 860; Connecticut College v. Calvert, supra, 87 Conn. 428; Evergreen Cemetery Assn. v. Beecher, supra, 53 Conn. 553; Linggi v. Garovotti, supra, 45 Cal. 2d 27; Wilton v. St. Johns, supra, 98 Fla. 47; Kessler v. Indianapolis, supra, 199 Ind. 426; Brown v. Gerald, supra, 100 Me. 357; Kirkwood v. Venable, supra, 351 Mo. 466-68; Kansas City v. Liebi, supra, 298 Mo. 591; Charlotte v. Heath, supra, 226 N.C. 754, 756; State ex rel. Harlan v. Centralia-Chehalis Electric Ry. & Power Co., supra, 42 Wash. 639-40; State ex rel. Tacoma Industrial Co. v. White River Power Co., supra, 39 Wash. 667-71.\n\n[18] I contrast this standard of proof with the standard of proof in the typical civil case between private parties, i.e., preponderance of the evidence. In the typical civil case, society is minimally concerned with the outcome, and the litigants share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion. E.g., State v. Rizzo, supra, 266 Conn. 210. In such a case, \"we require only a modicum of subjective certitude on the part of the fact finder: [as] long as the fact finder is persuaded that the plaintiff's assertions are probably more true\u2014 by no more than a ratio of fifty-one to forty-nine\u2014the plaintiff has met his burden of persuasion.\n\n\"At the other end of the spectrum is the criminal case. In such a case, the interests of the defendant are of such magnitude that historically and without any explicit constitutional requirement they have been protected by standards of proof designed to exclude as nearly as possible the likelihood of an erroneous judgment. In the administration of criminal justice, our society imposes almost the entire risk of error on itself . . . by requiring . . . that the state prove the guilt of an accused beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 210-11.\n\n[19] The majority's assertion that the clear and convincing standard should not be applied to evidence that the proposed development will, in fact, occur because the standard \"is reserved for past events, and not for predictions of future events\"; footnote 62 of the majority opinion; is not only incorrect, but entirely misses the point of the present analysis. As to the assertion's validity, the majority need only consider the fact that when the state wishes to exclude a criminal defendant from the witness room during the videotaping of a minor victim's testimony, it must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant's presence \"would . . . seriously [call] into question\" the trustworthiness of the victim's testimony. State v. Jarzbek, supra, 204 Conn. 704-705. Obviously, the testimony in question is the future testimony of the minor victim. The clear and convincing standard also is used in proceedings involving the termination of parental rights to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to establish that \"the natural parent cannot or will not provide a normal family home for the child.\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 767, 102 S. Ct. 1388, 71 L. Ed. 2d 599 (1982), quoting N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law \u00a7 384-b (1) (a) (iv) (McKinney Sup. 1981). More important, however, is the fact that the evidentiary showing suggested in the present case does not require a prediction of future events, but testimony and documentation as to the present development environment, which, if persuasive, might include signed development agreements, marketing studies that indicate a near-term demand for the proposed uses and evidence of economic trends that would support economic development within the three year time period before the condemnor is permitted to abandon the project and convey the acquired properties to developers free of the plan's restrictions. See General Statutes \u00a7 8-200 (b). In other words, although the purpose of such evidence is to document the probability that future development will occur as planned, the evidence itself would be grounded in present realities.\n\n[20] See also General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 8-128 through 8-133.\n\n[21] I note that the plaintiffs have not raised the issue of whether the statutory scheme is facially unconstitutional on the basis of a lack of adequate standards to ensure that the public purpose will be achieved. \"When a legislative body retains a police power, articulated standards and guidelines to limit the exercise of the police power are unnecessary. . . . Police powers which are delegated, however, must include minimum standards and guidelines for their application. . . . The failure to provide standards and guidelines for the application of the police power constitutes a delegation of legislative power repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" (Citations omitted.) Cary v. Rapid City, 559 N.W.2d 891, 895, (S.D. 1997); see 16A Am. Jur. 2d 257, supra, \u00a7 320; see also Berman v. Parker, supra, 348 U.S. 35 (standards contained in redevelopment statute sufficiently definite to sustain delegation of authority to administrative agencies to execute plan for eliminating blight).\n\nChapter 132 of the General Statutes contains numerous technical specifications regarding the content and adoption of a plan, project financing, the acquisition and transfer of properties and other matters. See generally General Statutes \u00a7 8-186 et seq. There are no statutory guidelines and criteria, however, to ensure that the plan primarily will benefit the public and, thereafter, that the proposed public benefit will be achieved. This is in stark contrast to chapter 130 of the General Statutes, in which the public purpose is defined as the elimination of blight and detailed guidance is provided as to how that purpose is to be accomplished. See generally General Statutes \u00a7 8-124 et seq.\n\n[22] In my view, the evidence in the record also is insufficient to establish that the preponderance of the evidence standard has been met.\n\n[23] On March 6, 2002, Claire Gaudiani, president of the development corporation, sent an e-mail to several other project participants, including Jones and David Goebel, executive director of the development corporation, which stated: \"What became clear during the executive committee meeting with the [development corporation] yesterday morning [is] that we absolutely posi[tively] need a fully signed and executable set of documents, including the real estate agreement, by May [1]. The importance of this fact to the law suit is apparently very high.\" The same sentiment was expressed by Goebel in an e-mail sent to Jones, among others, on March 27, 2001, when he stated that \"concluding the development agreement prior to the start of the Institute law suit will go a long way to deflate the argument that property is being taken with no plan in place. In fact, we feel this is crucial.\" Corcoran Jennison also realized the importance of a signed development agreement when Jones testified in a deposition taken on June 22, 2001, that she had received communications from others involved in the project that such an agreement should be in place prior to commencement of the trial in order to demonstrate that the project was moving forward.\n\n[24] The court's knowledge of the agreement is derived from the very brief document entered into evidence as plaintiff's exhibit JJJ and the testimony of various witnesses and deponents. The document in evidence contains only the first page of the proposed agreement. That page refers to the acquisition and demolition of properties by the development corporation, but not to any obligation on the part of the developer or other terms regarding the leasing of the properties in question.\n\n[25] These figures, which differ from the figures to which the tax assessor testified, are the figures contained in the development plan and quoted in the majority opinion. According to the tax assessor, the annual property tax revenue derived from the project area was approximately $362,111 prior to project approval, but was expected to increase to approximately $2,603,696 following completion of the project. If borne out, this constitutes an increase of approximately $2,241,585, far more than that projected by the development plan.\n\n[26] I note, however, that I disagree with the majority's conclusion that the trial court improperly determined that the takings on parcel 4A were not reasonably necessary because the proposed use was too vague and uncertain. See part VI of the majority opinion.\n\n[27] See footnote 21 of this opinion, however, for a brief discussion of constitutional concerns that the plaintiffs have not raised on appeal.\n\n[28] Such minimum standards might include a commencement date for the project, a construction schedule, a guaranteed number of jobs to be created, selection criteria for potential developers, financing requirements, the nature and timing of land disposition and a commitment as to the amount received in property taxes as a percentage of assessed value.\n\n[29] Field of Dreams (Universal Studios

life, in the dark Manhattan fog, creep\nWit' cats and dogs become meat\nAll that is sacred\nMy body lay naked\nAching for some weeks, maybe it was a hostage taken\nSome money making Jamaican\nHigh for thuggery disgrace on did him ugly, kicked his bloody face in\nMaybe he was mistaken for some great man\nIn a dirty place he lay in a gray basement\nShaking his scabs, crack bag, stabbed up four times, strong!\nWith a long rusty Jason\nDumped the smoldering corpse in a dumpster truck of garbage\nIn this mad man hell he laid in\nLogical was hatred\nSome replacement killer came through, left small traces\nEngraved his chest\nLeft him for death\nLeft him on his last breath\nCrawling, just to make a statement (hu hu huh)\nIn this matrix\nSubconsciously gazing the soft shell of a man\nSomehow found, amazing!\nBy the department of sanitation\nUnder city lights to the hospital\nHit him with the chest rockers, shockers\nPop him open just to keep his heart racing (Clear)\n(Chorus)\nWill he make it?\nWill he survive?\nTerror in his eyes\nNight the city cries\nPayback is crime\nHe damn near died\nBanished my wounds not mine\nThe city cries, drama ride\nGuns out the window, slide\nBefore me now the city cries\n\n(U-God)\n\nUnconscious for months (beep beep)\nDeep in coma shock\nWhen you awoke, it was hope\nDry throat\nChoking off tools, being fed ice cubes\nPain in you head\nChange of the bed\nDoped up and soaking while police on top\nDoctors monitor your heart (heart beating)\nSergeant Bilko came in with some zombie ass cops\nWhat we have here the chief embraces\nIn his hands he pulls out two briefcases\nA picture popped up on computer\nOne woman, one man, sharpshooter\nHe asked you do you remember these two faces?\n'Mind you you're blind, completely hung out to dry, victimized\nViolated as if you was raped\nWhat the hell\nYou escape well\nPolice investigated the scene\nScrape the crime scene\nDown to the bone panel\nWhile you lay frail in the enamel\nUnder you nails in the scuffle\nYou scratched some DNA samples that match\nThe blood on your clothes are not yours, it was his\nRight before you blacked out, took that blow\nIn September, you can't remember\nYou ripped his nose ring\nRight out his nose\nBefore he took it four times in the ribs\nBut somehow he lived\n]From the little bit of blood you grabbed\nHis skin type, you ran it back to forensic labs\nYour finger prints popped up\nThis is where it begins\nYour street name was Henry the Saint\nStaten Island's where your crib was at\nPark Hill project was your outlet\nYou was a target\nOr organized outfit\nNot by the mafia, this where it get chills\nYour wife hired some hitman to kill you for your ten million dollar will\nMoney fund drill\nBooby trapped perhaps\nLeft his food for the rats\nNow...\nYou might also like(Chorus)\nWill you make it?\nWill you survive?\nTerror in your eyes\nNight the city cries\nPayback is crime\nYou damn near died\nBandaged by wounds not mine\nThe city cries, drama ride\nGuns out the window slide\nBefore me now the city cries\n\n(U-God)\n\nOne cop's weakness\nWas heroic, he exposed pieces\nLeaked out information\nOn surveillance where his wife was staying\nPolice tracked her down\nBlood hound on the east side of town\nIn some skyscraper\nThey had video tapes of her\nAnd some porn star fling, her and the next door neighbor\nAnd the killer with the nose ring\nBut the police didn't have a case\n'Cause the victim couldn't remember a thing\nNot even a face\nHe had to clear his name\nHe bit off more than he could chew\nHis absent minded flash backs grew\nAnd grew to hate\nHe had to escape\nTo ICU\nOn the second day he came through\nHe concocted the impossible\nThe psych' slipped out the cuffs\nSomehow killed to armed guards (bang, bang)\nGrabbed their guns\nBefore he fled the hospital, slivers into the night\nIf police hunting was right\nHe's seeking for justice\nOff point bulletin\nOn a black male Jamaican\nMeanwhile a dark lookable crook\nIs in a alleyway for retaliation\nA limo pulled across the street from a gas station\nHe saw his wife\nAnd the nigga that knifed him\nHe wanted to mash him\nHe was real patient\nA devilish growl sensation\nAnd the rain grew to a foul meditation (sound of rain)\nOf betrayal, murder revenge\nBitch that set you up will get hers in the end\nIn the hall of the lobby floor\nSecurity on post\nGot gun butted three times in the head with the old dusty toast\nNow he slipped past the video cameras undetected\nTo the 25th floor\nApartment 504\nWhen he rang the bell (ding dong) sweet voice said\nShe cracked it open, her reply I thought you was dead\nIn a matter of seconds and inches\nThe door was hanging off the hinges (crash)\nHer eyes met the metal\nShe screamed Oh my God\nOut the back room the killer with the nose ring\nSmashed the nigga in the head with a porcelain vase\nShots ricochet like lightning roads\nPut the bimbo in arms\nThe drapes caught on fire, with no alarm\nThey crashed out the window, but they somehow held on\nDangling from a hundred stories high\nDon't doubt him\nWill he make it?\nContinued next album\n(Chorus)\nWill he make it?\nWill he survive?\nTerror in his eyes\nNight the city cries\nPayback is crime\nHe damn near died\nBandaged by wounds not mine\nThe city cries, drama ride\nGuns out the window slide...\n\nGolden Arm is as good as his reputation says\nWith his bare hands he stood all of us off\nAnd if he had weapons...\n\nGolden Arm never uses weapons\nSays he doesn't need them\nHe says using his bare arms is the best\nAnd he's probably right\nNobody's beaten him yet\nJust using his arms he beat us all then\nWe had no chance\nHe had us coldEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/942860",

You've got to give to really get. I'm the one who ought to know.\"\nSo I poured in the jar and started pumpin' and I heard a beautiful sound of water bubblin' 'n' splashin' up out of that hole in the ground. Then I took off my shoes and drunk my fill of that cold refreshin' treat. Tthen I thanked the Lord, and I thanked the pump, and I thanked old Desert Pete\n\nYou've got to prime the pump.

at a distance, from a twenty-mile radius, as we used to see it from the railway when we arrived there every year in Holy Week, was no more than a church epitomising the town, representing it, speaking of it and for it to the horizon, and as one drew near, gathering close about its long, dark cloak, sheltering from the wind, on the open plain, as a shepherd gathers his sheep, the woolly grey backs of its flocking houses, which a fragment of its mediaeval ramparts enclosed, here and there, in an outline as scrupulously circular as that of a little town in a primitive painting. To live in, Combray was a trifle depressing, like its streets, whose houses, built of the blackened stone of the country, fronted with outside steps, capped with gables which projected long shadows downwards, were so dark that one had, as soon as the sun began to go down, to draw back the curtains in the sitting-room windows; streets with the solemn names of Saints, not a few of whom figured in the history of the early lords of Combray, such as the Rue Saint-Hilaire, the Rue Saint-Jacques, in which my aunt's house stood, the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde, which ran past her railings, and the Rue du Saint-Esprit, on to which the little garden gate opened; and these Combray streets exist in so remote a quarter of my memory, painted in colours so different from those in which the world is decked for me to-day, that in fact one and all of them, and the church which towered above them in the Square, seem to me now more unsubstantial than the projections of my magic-lantern; while at times I feel that to be able to cross the Rue Saint-Hilaire again, to engage a room in the Rue de l'Oiseau, in the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesch\u00e9, from whose windows in the pavement used to rise a smell of cooking which rises still in my mind, now and then, in the same warm gusts of comfort, would be to secure a contact with the unseen world more marvellously supernatural than it would be to make Golo's acquaintance and to chat with Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandfather's cousin\u2014by courtesy my great-aunt\u2014with whom we used to stay, was the mother of that aunt L\u00e9onie who, since her husband's (my uncle Octave's) death, had gradually declined to leave, first Combray, then her house in Combray, then her bedroom, and finally her bed; and who now never 'came down,' but lay perpetually in an indefinite condition of grief, physical exhaustion, illness, obsessions, and religious observances. Her own room looked out over the Rue Saint-Jacques, which ran a long way further to end in the Grand-Pr\u00e9 (as distinct from the Petit-Pr\u00e9, a green space in the centre of the town where three streets met) and which, monotonous and grey, with the three high steps of stone before almost every one of its doors, seemed like a deep furrow cut by some sculptor of gothic images in the very block of stone out of which he had fashioned a Calvary or a Crib. My aunt's life was now practically confined to two adjoining rooms, in one of which she would rest in the afternoon while they, aired the other. They were rooms of that country order which (just as in certain climes whole tracts of air or ocean are illuminated or scented by myriads of protozoa which we cannot see) fascinate our sense of smell with the countless odours springing from their own special virtues, wisdom, habits, a whole secret system of life, invisible, superabundant and profoundly moral, which their atmosphere holds in solution; smells natural enough indeed, and coloured by circumstances as are those of the neighbouring countryside, but already humanised, domesticated, confined, an exquisite, skilful, limpid jelly, blending all the fruits of the season which have left the orchard for the store-room, smells changing with the year, but plenishing, domestic smells, which compensate for the sharpness of hoar frost with the sweet savour of warm bread, smells lazy and punctual as a village clock, roving smells, pious smells; rejoicing in a peace which brings only an increase of anxiety, and in a prosiness which serves as a deep source of poetry to the stranger who passes through their midst without having lived amongst them. The air of those rooms was saturated with the fine bouquet of a silence so nourishing, so succulent that I could not enter them without a sort of greedy enjoyment, particularly on those first mornings, chilly still, of the Easter holidays, when I could taste it more fully, because I had just arrived then at Combray: before I went in to wish my aunt good day I would be kept waiting a little time in the outer room, where the sun, a wintry sun still, had crept in to warm itself before the fire, lighted already between its two brick sides and plastering all the room and everything in it with a smell of soot, making the room like one of those great open hearths which one finds in the country, or one of the canopied mantelpieces in old castles under which one sits hoping that in the world outside it is raining or snowing, hoping almost for a catastrophic deluge to add the romance of shelter and security to the comfort of a snug retreat; I would turn to and fro between the prayer-desk and the stamped velvet armchairs, each one always draped in its crocheted antimacassar, while the fire, baking like a pie the appetising smells with which the air of the room, was thickly clotted, which the dewy and sunny freshness of the morning had already 'raised' and started to 'set,' puffed them and glazed them and fluted them and swelled them into an invisible though not impalpable country cake, an immense puff-pastry, in which, barely waiting to savour the crustier, more delicate, more respectable, but also drier smells of the cupboard, the chest-of-drawers, and the patterned wall-paper I always returned with an unconfessed gluttony to bury myself in the nondescript, resinous, dull, indigestible, and fruity smell of the flowered quilt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the next room I could hear my aunt talking quietly to herself. She never spoke save in low tones, because she believed that there was something broken in her head and floating loose there, which she might displace by talking too loud; but she never remained for long, even when alone, without saying something, because she believed that it was good for her throat, and that by keeping the blood there in circulation it would make less frequent the chokings and other pains to which she was liable; besides, in the life of complete inertia which she led she attached to the least of her sensations an extraordinary importance, endowed them with a Protean ubiquity which made it difficult for her to keep them secret, and, failing a confidant to whom she might communicate them, she used to promulgate them to herself in an unceasing monologue which was her sole form of activity. Unfortunately, having formed the habit of thinking aloud, she did not always take care to see that there was no one in the adjoining room, and I would often hear her saying to herself: \"I must not forget that I never slept a wink\"\u2014for \"never sleeping a wink\" was her great claim to distinction, and one admitted and respected in our household vocabulary; in the morning Fran\u00e7oise would not 'call' her, but would simply 'come to' her; during the day, when my aunt wished to take a nap, we used to say just that she wished to 'be quiet' or to 'rest'; and when in conversation she so far forgot herself as to say \"what made me wake up,\" or \"I dreamed that,\" she would flush and at once correct herself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After waiting a minute, I would go in and kiss her; Fran\u00e7oise would be making her tea; or, if my aunt were feeling 'upset,' she would ask instead for her 'tisane,' and it would be my duty to shake out of the chemist's little package on to a plate the amount of lime-blossom required for infusion in boiling water. The drying of the stems had twisted them into a fantastic trellis, in whose intervals the pale flowers opened, as though a painter had arranged them there, grouping them in the most decorative poses. The leaves, which had lost or altered their own appearance, assumed those instead of the most incongruous things imaginable, as though the transparent wings of flies or the blank sides of labels or the petals of roses had been collected and pounded, or interwoven as birds weave the material for their nests. A thousand trifling little details\u2014the charming prodigality of the chemist\u2014details which would have been eliminated from an artificial preparation, gave me, like a book in which one is astonished to read the name of a person whom one knows, the pleasure of finding that these were indeed real lime-blossoms, like those I had seen, when coming from the train, in the Avenue de la Gare, altered, but only because they were not imitations but the very same blossoms, which had grown old. And as each new character is merely a metamorphosis from something older, in these little grey balls I recognised green buds plucked before their time; but beyond all else the rosy, moony, tender glow which lit up the blossoms among the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden roses\u2014marking, as the radiance upon an old wall still marks the place of a vanished fresco, the difference between those parts of the tree which had and those which had not been 'in bloom'\u2014shewed me that these were petals which, before their flowering-time, the chemist's package had embalmed on warm evenings of spring. That rosy candlelight was still their colour, but half-extinguished and deadened in the diminished life which was now theirs, and which may be called the twilight of a flower. Presently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion, in which she would relish the savour of dead or faded blossom, a little madeleine, of which she would hold out a piece to me when it was sufficiently soft.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At one side of her bed stood a big yellow chest-of-drawers of lemon-wood, and a table which served at once as pharmacy and as high altar, on which, beneath a statue of Our Lady and a bottle of Vichy-C\u00e9lestins, might be found her service-books and her medical prescriptions, everything that she needed for the performance, in bed, of her duties to soul and body, to keep the proper times for pepsin and for vespers. On the other side her bed was bounded by the window: she had the street beneath her eyes, and would read in it from morning to night to divert the tedium of her life, like a Persian prince, the daily but immemorial chronicles of Combray, which she would discuss in detail afterwards with Fran\u00e7oise.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would not have been five minutes with my aunt before she would send me away in case I made her tired. She would hold out for me to kiss her sad brow, pale and lifeless, on which at this early hour she would not yet have arranged the false hair and through which the bones shone like the points of a crown of thorns\u2014or the beads of a rosary, and she would say to me: \"Now, my poor child, you must go away; go and get ready for mass; and if you see Fran\u00e7oise downstairs, tell her not to stay too long amusing herself with you; she must come up soon to see if I want anything.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise, who had been for many years in my aunt's service and did not at that time suspect that she would one day be transferred entirely to ours, was a little inclined to desert my aunt during the months which we spent in her house. There had been in my infancy, before we first went to Combray, and when my aunt L\u00e9onie used still to spend the winter in Paris with her mother, a time when I knew Fran\u00e7oise so little that on New Year's Day, before going into my great-aunt's house, my mother put a five-franc piece in my hand and said: \"Now, be careful. Don't make any mistake. Wait until you hear me say 'Good morning, Fran\u00e7oise,' and I touch your arm before you give it to her.\" No sooner had we arrived in my aunt's dark hall than we saw in the gloom, beneath the frills of a snowy cap as stiff and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the concentric waves of a smile of anticipatory gratitude. It was Fran\u00e7oise, motionless and erect, framed in the small doorway of the corridor like the statue of a saint in its niche. When we had grown more accustomed to this religious darkness we could discern in her features a disinterested love of all humanity, blended with a tender respect for the 'upper classes' which raised to the most honourable quarter of her heart the hope of receiving her due reward. Mamma pinched my arm sharply and said in a loud voice: \"Good morning, Fran\u00e7oise.\" At this signal my fingers parted and I let fall the coin, which found a receptacle in a confused but outstretched hand. But since we had begun to go to Combray there was no one I knew better than Fran\u00e7oise. We were her favourites, and in the first years at least, while she shewed the same consideration for us as for my aunt, she enjoyed us with a keener relish, because we had, in addition to our dignity as part of 'the family' (for she had for those invisible bonds by which community of blood unites the members of a family as much respect as any Greek tragedian), the fresh charm of not being her customary employers. And so with what joy would she welcome us, with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so bad for us, on the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was often an icy wind; while Mamma inquired after her daughter and her nephews, and if her grandson was good-looking, and what they were going to make of him, and whether he took after his granny.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Later, when no one else was in the room, Mamma, who knew that Fran\u00e7oise was still mourning for her parents, who had been dead for years, would speak of them kindly, asking her endless little questions about them and their lives.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had guessed that Fran\u00e7oise was not over-fond of her son-in-law, and that he spoiled the pleasure she found in visiting her daughter, as the two could not talk so freely when he was there. And so one day, when Fran\u00e7oise was going to their house, some miles from Combray, Mamma said to her, with a smile: \"Tell me, Fran\u00e7oise, if Julien has had to go away, and you have Marguerite to yourself all day, you will be very sorry, but will make the best of it, won't you?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Fran\u00e7oise answered, laughing: \"Madame knows everything; Madame is worse than the X-rays\" (she pronounced 'x' with an affectation of difficulty and with a smile in deprecation of her, an unlettered woman's, daring to employ a scientific term) \"they brought here for Mme. Octave, which see what is in your heart\"\u2014and she went off, disturbed that anyone should be caring about her, perhaps anxious that we should not see her in tears: Mamma was the first person who had given her the pleasure of feeling that her peasant existence, with its simple joys and sorrows, might offer some interest, might be a source of grief or pleasure to some one other than herself.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My aunt resigned herself to doing without Fran\u00e7oise to some extent during our visits, knowing how much my mother appreciated the services of so active and intelligent a maid, one who looked as smart at five o'clock in the morning in her kitchen, under a cap whose stiff and dazzling frills seemed to be made of porcelain, as when dressed for churchgoing; who did everything in the right way, who toiled like a horse, whether she was well or ill, but without noise, without the appearance of doing anything; the only one of my aunt's maids who when Mamma asked for hot water or black coffee would bring them actually boiling; she was one of those servants who in a household seem least satisfactory, at first, to a stranger, doubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest of him and shew him no special attention, knowing very well that they have no real need of him, that he will cease to be invited to the house sooner than they will be dismissed from it; who, on the other hand, cling with most fidelity to those masters and mistresses who have tested and proved their real capacity, and do not look for that superficial responsiveness, that slavish affability, which may impress a stranger favourably, but often conceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of training can produce the least trace of individuality.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Fran\u00e7oise, having seen that my parents had everything they required, first went upstairs again to give my aunt her pepsin and to find out from her what she would take for luncheon, very few mornings pased but she was called upon to give an opinion, or to furnish an explanation, in regard to some important event.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just fancy, Fran\u00e7oise, Mme. Goupil went by more than a quarter of an hour late to fetch her sister: if she loses any more time on the way I should not be at all surprised if she got in after the Elevation.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, there'd be nothing wonderful in that,\" would be the answer. Or:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fran\u00e7oise, if you had come in five minutes ago, you would have seen Mme. Imbert go past with some asparagus twice the size of what mother Callot has: do try to find out from her cook where she got them. You know you've been putting asparagus in all your sauces this spring; you might be able to get some like these for our visitors.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I shouldn't be surprised if they came from the Cur\u00e9's,\" Fran\u00e7oise would say, and:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm sure you wouldn't, my poor Fran\u00e7oise,\" my aunt would reply, raising her shoulders. \"From the Cur\u00e9's, indeed! You know quite well that he can never grow anything but wretched little twigs of asparagus, not asparagus at all. I tell you these ones were as thick as my arm. Not your arm, of course, but my-poor arm, which has grown so much thinner again this year.\" Or:\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fran\u00e7oise, didn't you hear that bell just now! It split my head.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, Mme. Octave.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, poor girl, your skull must be very thick; you may thank God for that. It was Maguelone come to fetch Dr. Piperaud. He came out with her at once and they went off along the Rue de l'Oiseau. There must be some child ill.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh dear, dear; the poor little creature!\" would come with a sigh from Fran\u00e7oise, who could not hear of any calamity befalling a person unknown to her, even in some distant part of the world, without beginning to lament. Or:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Fran\u00e7oise, for whom did they toll the passing-bell just now? Oh dear, of course, it would be for Mme. Rousseau. And to think that I had forgotten that she passed away the other night. Indeed, it is time the Lord called me home too; I don't know what has become of my head since I lost my poor Octave. But I am wasting your time, my good girl.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Indeed no, Mme. Octave, my time is not so precious; whoever made our time didn't sell it to us. I am just going to see that my fire hasn't gone out.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this way Fran\u00e7oise and my aunt made a critical valuation between them, in the course of these morning sessions, of the earliest happenings of the day. But sometimes these happenings assumed so mysterious or so alarming an air that my aunt felt she could not wait until it was time for Fran\u00e7oise to come upstairs, and then a formidable and quadruple peal would resound through the house.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, Mme. Octave, it is not time for your pepsin,\" Fran\u00e7oise would begin. \"Are you feeling faint?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, thank you, Fran\u00e7oise,\" my aunt would reply, \"that is to say, yes; for you know well that there is very seldom a time when I don't feel faint; one day I shall pass away like Mme. Rousseau, before I know where I am; but that is not why I rang. Would you believe that I have just seen, as plainly as I see you, Mme. Goupil with a little girl I didn't know at all. Run and get a pennyworth of salt from Camus. It's not often that Th\u00e9odore can't tell you who a person is.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But that must be M. Pupin's daughter,\" Fran\u00e7oise would say, preferring to stick to an immediate explanation, since she had been perhaps twice already into Camus's shop that morning.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"M. Pupin's daughter! Oh, that's a likely story, my poor Fran\u00e7oise. Do you think I should not have recognised M. Pupin's daughter!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I don't mean the big one, Mme. Octave; I mean the little girl, he one who goes to school at Jouy. I seem to have seen her once already his morning.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, if that's what it is!\" my aunt would say, \"she must have come over for the holidays. Yes, that is it. No need to ask, she will have come over for the holidays. But then we shall soon see Mme. Sazerat come along and ring her sister's door-bell, for her luncheon. That will be it! I saw the boy from Galopin's go by with a tart. You will see that the tart was for Mme. Goupil.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Once Mme. Goupil has anyone in the house, Mme. Octave, you won't be long in seeing all her folk going in to their luncheon there, for it's not so early as it was,\" would be the answer, for Fran\u00e7oise, who was anxious to retire downstairs to look after our own meal, was not sorry to leave my aunt with the prospect of such a distraction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh! not before midday!\" my aunt would reply in a tone of resignation, darting an uneasy glance at the clock, but stealthily, so as not to let it be seen that she, who had renounced all earthly joys, yet found a keen satisfaction in learning that Mme. Goupil was expecting company to luncheon, though, alas, she must wait a little more than an hour still before enjoying the spectacle. \"And it will come in the middle of my luncheon!\" she would murmur to herself. Her luncheon was such a distraction in itself that she did not like any other to come at the same time. \"At least, you will not forget to give me my creamed eggs on one of the flat plates?\" These were the only plates which had pictures on them and my aunt used to amuse herself at every meal by reading the description on whichever might have been sent up to her. She would put on her spectacles and spell out: \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,\" \"Aladdin, or the Wonderful Lamp,\" and smile, and say \"Very good indeed.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I may as well go across to Camus...\" Fran\u00e7oise would hazard, seeing that my aunt had no longer any intention of sending her there.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, no; it's not worth while now; it's certain to be the Pupin girl. My poor Fran\u00e7oise, I am sorry to have made you come upstairs for nothing.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But it was not for nothing, as my aunt well knew, that she had rung for Fran\u00e7oise, since at Combray a person whom one 'didn't know at all' was as incredible a being as any mythological deity, and it was apt to be forgotten that after each occasion on which there had appeared in the Rue du Saint-Esprit or in the Square one of these bewildering phenomena, careful and exhaustive researches had invariably reduced the fabulous monster to the proportions of a person whom one 'did know,' either personally or in the abstract, in his or her civil status as being more or less closely related to some family in Combray. It would turn out to be Mme. Sauton's son discharged from the army, or the Abb\u00e9 Perdreau's niece come home from her convent, or the Cur\u00e9's brother, a tax-collector at Ch\u00e2teaudun, who had just retired on a pension or had come over to Combray for the holidays. On first noticing them you have been impressed by the thought that there might be in Combray people whom you 'didn't know at all,' simply because, you had failed to recognise or identify them at once. And yet long beforehand Mme. Sauton and the Cur\u00e9 had given warning that they expected their 'strangers.' In the evening, when I came in and went upstairs to tell my aunt the incidents of our walk, if I was rash enough to say to her that we had passed, near the Pont-Vieux, a man whom my grandfather didn't know:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A man grandfather didn't know at all!\" she would exclaim. \"That's a likely story.\" None the less, she would be a little disturbed by the news, she would wish to have the details correctly, and so my grandfather would be summoned. \"Who can it have been that you passed near the Pont-Vieux, uncle? A man you didn't know at all?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, of course I did,\" my grandfather would answer; \"it was Prosper, Mme. Bouilleboeuf's gardener's brother.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, well!\" my aunt would say, calm again but slightly flushed still; \"and the boy told me that you had passed a man you didn't know at all!\" After which I would be warned to be more careful of what I said, and not to upset my aunt so by thoughtless remarks. Everyone was so well known in Combray, animals as well as people, that if my aunt had happened to see a dog go by which she 'didn't know at all' she would think about it incessantly, devoting to the solution of the incomprehensible problem all her inductive talent and her leisure hours.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That will be Mme. Sazerat's dog,\" Fran\u00e7oise would suggest, without any real conviction, but in the hope of peace, and so that my aunt should not 'split her head.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As if I didn't know Mme. Sazerat's dog!\"\u2014for my aunt's critical mind would not so easily admit any fresh fact.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, but that will be the new dog M. Galopin has brought her from Lisieux.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, if that's what it is!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It seems, it's a most engaging animal,\" Fran\u00e7oise would go on, having got the story from Th\u00e9odore, \"as clever as a Christian, always in a good temper, always friendly, always everything that's nice. It's not often you see an animal so well-behaved at that age. Mme. Octave, it's high time I left you; I can't afford to stay here amusing myself; look, it's nearly ten o'clock and my fire not lighted yet, and I've still to dress the asparagus.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What, Fran\u00e7oise, more asparagus! It's a regular disease of asparagus you have got this year: you will make our Parisians sick of it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, no, Madame Octave, they like it well enough. They'll be coming back from church soon as hungry as hunters, and they won't eat it out of the back of their spoons, you'll see.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Church! why, they must be there now; you'd better not lose any time. Go and look after your luncheon.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While my aunt gossiped on in this way with Fran\u00e7oise I would have accompanied my parents to mass. How I loved it: how clearly I can see it still, our church at Combray! The old porch by which we went in, black, and full of holes as a cullender, was worn out of shape and deeply furrowed at the sides (as also was the holy water stoup to which it led us) just as if the gentle grazing touch of the cloaks of peasant-women going into the church, and of their fingers dipping into the water, had managed by agelong repetition to acquire a destructive force, to impress itself on the stone, to carve ruts in it like those made by cart-wheels upon stone gate-posts against which they are driven every day. Its memorial stones, beneath which the noble dust of the Abbots of Combray, who were buried there, furnished the choir with a sort of spiritual pavement, were themselves no longer hard and lifeless matter, for time had softened and sweetened them, and had made them melt like honey and flow beyond their proper margins, either surging out in a milky, frothing wave, washing from its place a florid gothic capital, drowning the white violets of the marble floor; or else reabsorbed into their limits, contracting still further a crabbed Latin inscription, bringing a fresh touch of fantasy into the arrangement of its curtailed characters, closing together two letters of some word of which the rest were disproportionately scattered. Its windows were never so brilliant as on days when the sun scarcely shone, so that if it was dull outside you might be certain of fine weather in church. One of them was filled from top to bottom by a solitary figure, like the king on a playing-card, who lived up there beneath his canopy of stone, between earth and heaven; and in the blue light of its slanting shadow, on weekdays sometimes, at noon, when there was no service (at one of those rare moments when the airy, empty church, more human somehow and more luxurious with the sun shewing off all its rich furnishings, seemed to have almost a habitable air, like the hall\u2014all sculptured stone and painted glass\u2014of some mediaeval mansion), you might see Mme. Sazerat kneel for an instant, laying down on the chair beside her own a neatly corded parcel of little cakes which she had just bought at the baker's and was taking home for her luncheon. In another, a mountain of rosy snow, at whose foot a battle was being fought, seemed to have frozen the window also, which it swelled and distorted with its cloudy sleet, like a pane to which snowflakes have drifted and clung, but flakes illumined by a sunrise\u2014the same, doubtless, which purpled the reredos of the altar with tints so fresh that they seemed rather to be thrown on it for a moment by a light shining from outside and shortly to be extinguished than painted and permanently fastened on the stone. And all of them were so old that you could see, here and there, their silvery antiquity sparkling with the dust of centuries and shewing in its threadbare brilliance the very cords of their lovely tapestry of glass. There was one among them which was a tall panel composed of a hundred little rectangular windows, of blue principally, like a great game of patience of the kind planned to beguile King Charles VI; but, either because a ray of sunlight had gleamed through it or because my own shifting vision had drawn across the window, whose colours died away and were rekindled by turns, a rare and transient fire\u2014the next instant it had taken on all the iridescence of a peacock's tail, then shook and wavered in a flaming and fantastic shower, distilled and dropping from the groin of the dark and rocky vault down the moist walls, as though it were along the bed of some rainbow grotto of sinuous stalactites that I was following my parents, who marched before me, their prayer-books clasped in their hands; a moment later the little lozenge windows had put on the deep transparence, the unbreakable hardness of sapphires clustered on some enormous breastplate; but beyond which could be distinguished, dearer than all such treasures, a fleeting smile from the sun, which could be seen and felt as well here, in the blue and gentle flood in which it washed the masonry, as on the pavement of the Square or the straw of the market-place; and even on our first Sundays, when we came down before Easter, it would console me for the blackness and bareness of the earth outside by making burst into blossom, as in some springtime in old history among the heirs of Saint Louis, this dazzling and gilded carpet of forget-me-nots in glass.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two tapestries of high warp represented the coronation of Esther (in which tradition would have it that the weaver had given to Ahasuerus the features of one of the kings of France and to Esther those of a lady of Guermantes whose lover he had been); their colours had melted into one another, so as to add expression, relief, light to the pictures. A touch of red over the lips of Esther had strayed beyond their outline; the yellow on her dress was spread with such unctuous plumpness as to have acquired a kind of solidity, and stood boldly out from the receding atmosphere; while the green of the trees, which was still bright in Silk and wool among the lower parts of the panel, but had quite 'gone' at the top, separated in a paler scheme, above the dark trunks, the yellowing upper branches, tanned and half-obliterated by the sharp though sidelong rays of an invisible sun. All these things and, still more than these, the treasures which had come to the church from personages who to me were almost legendary figures (such as the golden cross wrought, it was said, by Saint Eloi and presented by Dagobert, and the tomb of the sons of Louis the Germanic in porphyry and enamelled copper), because of which I used to go forward into the church when we were making our way to our chairs as into a fairy-haunted valley, where the rustic sees with amazement on a rock, a tree, a marsh, the tangible proofs of the little people's supernatural passage\u2014all these things made of the church for me something entirely different from the rest of the town; a building which occupied, so to speak, four dimensions of space\u2014the name of the fourth being Time\u2014which had sailed the centuries with that old nave, where bay after bay, chapel after chapel, seemed to stretch across and hold down and conquer not merely a few yards of soil, but each successive epoch from which the whole building had emerged triumphant, hiding the rugged barbarities of the eleventh century in the thickness of its walls, through which nothing could be seen of the heavy arches, long stopped and blinded with coarse blocks of ashlar, except where, near the porch, a deep groove was furrowed into one wall by the tower-stair; and even there the barbarity was veiled by the graceful gothic arcade which pressed coquettishly upon it, like a row of grown-up sisters who, to hide him from the eyes of strangers, arrange themselves smilingly in front of a countrified, unmannerly and ill-dressed younger brother; rearing into the sky above the Square a tower which had looked down upon Saint Louis, and seemed to behold him still; and thrusting down with its crypt into the blackness of a Merovingian night, through which, guiding us with groping finger-tips beneath the shadowy vault, ribbed strongly as an immense bat's wing of stone, Th\u00e9odore or his sister would light up for us with a candle the tomb of Sigebert's little daughter, in which a deep hole, like the bed of a fossil, had been bored, or so it was said, \"by a crystal lamp which, on the night when the Frankish princess was murdered, had left, of its own accord, the golden chains by which it was suspended where the apse is to-day and with neither the crystal broken nor the light extinguished had buried itself in the stone, through which it had gently forced its way.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then the apse of Combray: what am I to say of that? It was so coarse, so devoid of artistic beauty, even of the religious spirit. From outside, since the street crossing which it commanded was on a lower level, its great wall was thrust upwards from a basement of unfaced ashlar, jagged with flints, in all of which there was nothing particularly ecclesiastical; the windows seemed to have been pierced at an abnormal height, and its whole appearance was that of a prison wall rather than of a church. And certainly in later years, were I to recall all the glorious apses that I had seen, it would never enter my mind to compare with any one of them the apse of Combray. Only, one day, turning out of a little street in some country town, I came upon three alley-ways that converged, and facing them an old wall, rubbed, worn, crumbling, and unusually high; with windows pierced in it far overhead and the same asymmetrical appearance as the apse of Combray. And at that moment I did not say to myself, as at Chartres I might have done or at Rheims, with what strength the religious feeling had been expressed in its construction, but instinctively I exclaimed \"The Church!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The church! A dear, familiar friend; close pressed in the Rue Saint-Hilaire, upon which its north door opened, by its two neighbours, Mme. Loiseau's house and the pharmacy of M. Rapin, against which its walls rested without interspace; a simple citizen of Combray, who might have had her number in the street had the streets of Combray borne numbers, and at whose door one felt that the postman ought to stop on his morning rounds, before going into Mme. Loiseau's and after leaving M. Rapin's, there existed, for all that, between the church and everything in Combray that was not the church a clear line of demarcation which I have never succeeded in eliminating from my mind. In vain might Mme. Loiseau deck her window-sills with fuchsias, which developed the bad habit of letting their branches trail at all times and in all directions, head downwards, and whose flowers had no more important business, when they were big enough to taste the joys of life, than to go and cool their purple, congested cheeks against the dark front of the church; to me such conduct sanctified the fuchsias not at all; between the flowers and the blackened stones towards which they leaned, if my eyes could discern no interval, my mind preserved the impression of an abyss.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From a long way off one could distinguish and identify the steeple of Saint-Hilaire inscribing its unforgettable form upon a horizon beneath which Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train which brought us down from Paris at Easter-time my father caught sight of it, as it slipped into every fold of the sky in turn, its little iron cock veering continually in all directions, he would say: \"Come, get your wraps together, we are there.\" And on one of the longest walks we ever took from Combray there was a spot where the narrow road emerged suddenly on to an immense plain, closed at the horizon by strips of forest over which rose and stood alone the fine point of Saint-Hilaire's steeple, but so sharpened and so pink that it seemed to be no more than sketched on the sky by the finger-nail of a painter anxious to give to such a landscape, to so pure a piece of 'nature,' this little sign of art, this single indication of human existence. As one drew near it and could make out the remains of the square tower, half in ruins, which still stood by its side, though without rivalling it in height, one was struck, first of all, by the tone, reddish and sombre, of its stones; and on a misty morning in autumn one would have called it, to see it rising above the violet thunder-cloud of the vineyards, a ruin of purple, almost the colour of the wild vine.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often in the Square, as we came home, my grandmother would make me stop to look up at it. From the tower windows, placed two and two, one pair above another, with that right and original proportion in their spacing to which not only human faces owe their beauty and dignity, it released, it let fall at regular intervals flights of jackdaws which for a little while would wheel and caw, as though the ancient stones which allowed them to sport thus and never seemed to see them, becoming of a sudden uninhabitable and discharging some infinitely disturbing element, had struck them and driven them forth. Then after patterning everywhere the violet velvet of the evening air, abruptly soothed, they would return and be absorbed in the tower, deadly no longer but benignant, some perching here and there (not seeming to move, but snapping, perhaps, and swallowing some passing insect) on the points of turrets, as a seagull perches, with an angler's immobility, on the crest of a wave. Without quite knowing why, my grandmother found in the steeple of Saint-Hilaire that absence of vulgarity, pretension, and meanness which made her love\u2014and deem rich in beneficent influences\u2014nature itself, when the hand of man had not, as did my great-aunt's gardener, trimmed it, and the works of genius. And certainly every part one saw of the church served to distinguish the whole from any other building by a kind of general feeling which pervaded it, but it was in the steeple that the church seemed to display a consciousness of itself, to affirm its individual and responsible existence. It was the steeple which spoke for the church. I think, too, that in a confused way my grandmother found in the steeple of Combray what she prized above anything else in the world, namely, a natural air and an air of distinction. Ignorant of architecture, she would say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My dears, laugh at me if you like; it is not conventionally beautiful, but there is something in its quaint old face which pleases me. If it could play the piano, I am sure it would really play.\" And when she gazed on it, when her eyes followed the gentle tension, the fervent inclination of its stony slopes which drew together as they rose, like hands joined in prayer, she would absorb herself so utterly in the outpouring of the spire that her gaze seemed to leap upwards with it; her lips at the same time curving in a friendly smile for the worn old stones of which the setting sun now illumined no more than the topmost pinnacles, which, at the point where they entered that zone of sunlight and were softened and sweetened by it, seemed to have mounted suddenly far higher, to have become truly remote, like a song whose singer breaks into falsetto, an octave above the accompanying air.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which shaped and crowned and consecrated every occupation, every hour of the day, every point of view in the town. From my bedroom window I could discern no more than its base, which had been freshly covered with slates; but when on Sundays I saw these, in the hot light of a summer morning, blaze like a black sun I would say to myself: \"Good heavens! nine o'clock! I must get ready for mass at once if I am to have time to go in and kiss aunt L\u00e9onie first,\" and I would know exactly what was the colour of the sunlight upon the Square, I could feel the heat and dust of the market, the shade behind the blinds of the shop into which Mamma would perhaps go on her way to mass, penetrating its odour of unbleached calico, to purchase a handkerchief or something, of which the draper himself would let her see what he had, bowing from the waist: who, having made everything ready for shutting up, had just gone into the back shop to put on his Sunday coat and to wash his hands, which it was his habit, every few minutes and even on the saddest occasions, to rub one against the other with an air of enterprise, cunning, and success.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And again, after mass, when we looked in to tell Th\u00e9odore to bring a larger loaf than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the fine weather to come over from Thiberzy for luncheon, we had in front of us the steeple, which, baked and brown itself like a larger loaf still of 'holy bread,' with flakes and sticky drops on it of sunlight, pricked its sharp point into the blue sky. And in the evening, as I came in from my walk and thought of the approaching moment when I must say good night to my mother and see her no more, the steeple was by contrast so kindly, there at the close of day, that I would imagine it as being laid, like a brown velvet cushion, against\u2014as being thrust into the pallid sky which had yielded beneath its pressure, had sunk slightly so as to make room for it, and had correspondingly risen on either side; while the cries of the birds wheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence, to elongate its spire still further, and to invest it with some quality beyond the power of words.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even when our errands lay in places behind the church, from which it could not be seen, the view seemed always to have been composed with reference to the steeple, which would stand up, now here, now there, among the houses, and was perhaps even more affecting when it appeared thus without the church. And, indeed, there are many others which look best when seen in this way, and I can call to mind vignettes of housetops with surmounting steeples in quite another category of art than those formed by the dreary streets of Combray. I shall never forget, in a quaint Norman town not far from Balbec, two charming eighteenth-century houses, dear to me and venerable for many reasons, between which, when one looks up at them from a fine garden which descends in terraces to the river, the gothic spire of a church (itself hidden by the houses) soars into the sky with the effect of crowning and completing their fronts, but in a material so different, so precious, so beringed, so rosy, so polished, that it is at once seen to be no more a part of them than would be a part of two pretty pebbles lying side by side, between which it had been washed on the beach, the purple, crinkled spire of some sea-shell spun out into a turret and gay with glossy colour. Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of the town, I know a window from which one can see across a first, a second, and even a third layer of jumbled roofs, street beyond street, a violet bell, sometimes ruddy, sometimes too, in the finest 'prints' which the atmosphere makes of it, of an ashy solution of black; which is, in fact, nothing else than the dome of Saint-Augustin, and which imparts to this view of Paris the character of some of the Piranesi views of Rome. But since into none of these little etchings, whatever the taste my memory may have been able to bring to their execution, was it able to contribute an element I have long lost, the feeling which makes us not merely regard a thing as a spectacle, but believe in it as in a creature without parallel, so none of them keeps in dependence on it a whole section of my inmost life as does the memory of those aspects of the steeple of Combray from the streets behind the church. Whether one saw it at five o'clock when going to call for letters at the post-office, some doors away from one, on the left, raising abruptly with its isolated peak the ridge of housetops; or again, when one had to go in and ask for news of Mme. Sazerat, one's eyes followed the line where it ran low again beyond the farther, descending slope, and one knew that it would be the second turning after the steeple; or yet again, if pressing further afield one went to the station, one saw it obliquely, shewing in profile fresh angles and surfaces, like a solid body surprised at some unknown point in its revolution; or, from the banks of the Vivonne, the apse, drawn muscularly together and heightened in perspective, seemed to spring upwards with the effort which the steeple made to hurl its spire-point into the heart of heaven: it was always to the steeple that one must return, always it which dominated everything else, summing up the houses with an unexpected pinnacle, raised before me like the Finger of God, Whose Body might have been concealed below among the crowd of human bodies without fear of my confounding It, for that reason, with them. And so even to-day in any large provincial town, or in a quarter of Paris which I do not know well, if a passer-by who is 'putting me on the right road' shews me from afar, as a point to aim at, some belfry of a hospital, or a convent steeple lifting the peak of its ecclesiastical cap at the corner of the street which I am to take, my memory need only find in it some dim resemblance to that dear and vanished outline, and the passer-by, should he turn round to make sure that I have not gone astray, would see me, to his astonishment, oblivious of the walk that I had planned to take or the place where I was obliged to call, standing still on the spot, before that steeple, for hours on end, motionless, trying to remember, feeling deep within myself a tract of soil reclaimed from the waters of Lethe slowly drying until the buildings rise on it again; and then no doubt, and then more uneasily than when, just now, I asked him for a direction, I will seek my way again, I will turn a corner... but... the goal is in my heart...\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On our way home from mass we would often meet M. Legrandin, who, detained in Paris by his professional duties as an engineer, could only (except in the regular holiday seasons) visit his home at Combray between Saturday evenings and Monday mornings. He was one of that class of men who, apart from a scientific career in which they may well have proved brilliantly successful, have acquired an entirely different kind of culture, literary or artistic, of which they make no use in the specialised work of their profession, but by which their conversation profits. More 'literary' than many 'men of letters' (we were not aware at this period that M. Legrandin had a distinct reputation as a writer, and so were greatly astonished to find that a well-known composer had set some verses of his to music), endowed with a greater ease in execution than many painters, they imagine that the life they are obliged to lead is not that for which they are really fitted, and they bring to their regular occupations either a fantastic indifference or a sustained and lofty application, scornful, bitter, and conscientious. Tall, with a good figure, a fine, thoughtful face, drooping fair moustaches, a look of disillusionment in his blue eyes, an almost exaggerated refinement of courtesy; a talker such as we had never heard; he was in the sight of my family, who never ceased to quote him as an example, the very pattern of a gentleman, who took life in the noblest and most delicate manner. My grandmother alone found fault with him for speaking a little too well, a little too much like a book, for not using a vocabulary as natural as his loosely knotted Lavalli\u00e8re neckties, his short, straight, almost schoolboyish coat. She was astonished, too, at the furious invective which he was always launching at the aristocracy, at fashionable life, and 'snobbishness'\u2014\"undoubtedly,\" he would say, \"the sin of which Saint Paul is thinking when he speaks of the sin for which there is no forgiveness.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Worldly ambition was a thing which my grandmother was so little capable of feeling, or indeed of understanding, that it seemed to her futile to apply so much heat to its condemnation. Besides, she thought it in not very good taste that M. Legrandin, whose sister was married to a country gentleman of Lower Normandy near Balbec, should deliver himself of such violent attacks upon the nobles, going so far as to blame the Revolution for not having guillotined them all.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well met, my friends!\" he would say as he came towards us. \"You are lucky to spend so much time here; to-morrow I have to go back to Paris, to squeeze back into my niche.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I admit,\" he went on, with his own peculiar smile, gently ironical, disillusioned and vague, \"I have every useless thing in the world in my house there. The only thing wanting is the necessary thing, a great patch of open sky like this. Always try to keep a patch of sky above your life, little boy,\" he added, turning to me. \"You have a soul in you of rare quality, an artist's nature; never let it starve for lack of what it needs.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, on our reaching the house, my aunt would send to ask us whether Mme. Goupil had indeed arrived late for mass, not one of us could inform her. Instead, we increased her anxiety by telling her that there was a painter at work in the church copying the window of Gilbert the Bad. Fran\u00e7oise was at once dispatched to the grocer's, but returned empty-handed owing to the absence of Th\u00e9odore, whose dual profession of choirman, with a part in the maintenance of the fabric, and of grocer's assistant gave him not only relations with all sections of society, but an encyclopaedic knowledge of their affairs.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah!\" my aunt would sigh, \"I wish it were time for Eulalie to come. She is really the only person who will be able to tell me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eulalie was a limping, energetic, deaf spinster who had 'retired' after the death of Mme. de la Bretonnerie, with whom she had been in service from her childhood, and had then taken a room beside the church, from which she would incessantly emerge, either to attend some service, or, when there was no service, to say a prayer by herself or to give Th\u00e9odore a hand; the rest of her time she spent in visiting sick persons like my aunt L\u00e9onie, to whom she would relate everything that had occurred at mass or vespers. She was not above adding occasional pocket-money to the little income which was found for her by the family of her old employers by going from time to time to look after the Cur\u00e9's linen, or that of some other person of note in the clerical world of Combray. Above a mantle of black cloth she wore a little white coif that seemed almost to attach her to some Order, and an infirmity of the skin had stained part of her cheeks and her crooked nose the bright red colour of balsam. Her visits were the one great distraction in the life of my aunt L\u00e9onie, who now saw hardly anyone else, except the reverend Cur\u00e9. My aunt had by degrees erased every other visitor's name from her list, because they all committed the fatal error, in her eyes, of falling into one or other of the two categories of people she most detested. One group, the worse of the two, and the one of which she rid herself first, consisted of those who advised her not to take so much care of herself, and preached (even if only negatively and with no outward signs beyond an occasional disapproving silence or doubting smile) the subversive doctrine that a sharp walk in the sun and a good red beefsteak would do her more good (her, who had had two dreadful sips of Vichy water on her stomach for fourteen hours!) than all her medicine bottles and her bed. The other category was composed of people who appeared to believe that she was more seriously ill than she thought, in fact that she was as seriously ill as she said. And so none of those whom she had allowed upstairs to her room, after considerable hesitation and at Fran\u00e7oise urgent request, and who in the course of their visit had shewn how unworthy they were of the honour which had been done them by venturing a timid: \"Don't you think that if you were just to stir out a little on really fine days...?\" or who, on the other hand, when she said to them: \"I am very low, very low; nearing the end, dear friends!\" had replied: \"Ah, yes, when one has no strength left! Still, you may last a while yet\"; each party alike might be certain that her doors would never open to them again. And if Fran\u00e7oise was amused by the look of consternation on my aunt's face whenever she saw, from her bed, any of these people in the Rue du Saint-Esprit, who looked as if they were coming to see her, or heard her own door-bell ring, she would laugh far more heartily, as at a clever trick, at my aunt's devices (which never failed) for having them sent away, and at their look of discomfiture when they had to turn back without having seen her; and would be filled with secret admiration for her mistress, whom she felt to be superior to all these other people, inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to see them. In short, my aunt stipulated, at one and the same time, that whoever came to see her must approve of her way of life, commiserate with her in her sufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In all this Eulalie excelled. My aunt might say to her twenty times in a minute: \"The end is come at last, my poor Eulalie!\", twenty times Eulalie would retort with: \"Knowing your illness as you do, Mme. Octave, you will live to be a hundred, as Mme. Sazerin said to me only yesterday.\" For one of Eulalie's most rooted beliefs, and one that the formidable list of corrections which her experience must have compiled was powerless to eradicate, was that Mme. Sazerat's name was really Mme. Sazerin.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I do not ask to live to a hundred,\" my aunt would say, for she preferred to have no definite limit fixed to the number of her days.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And since, besides this, Eulalie knew, as no one else knew, how to distract my aunt without tiring her, her visits, which took place regularly every Sunday, unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent them, were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on those days in a state of expectation, appetising enough to begin with, but at once changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if Eulalie were a minute late in coming. For, if unduly prolonged, the rapture of waiting for Eulalie became a torture, and my aunt would never cease from looking at the time, and yawning, and complaining of each of her symptoms in turn. Eulalie's ring, if it sounded from the front door at the very end of the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would almost make her ill. For the fact was that on Sundays she thought of nothing else than this visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended Fran\u00e7oise would become impatient for us to leave the dining-room so that she might go upstairs to 'occupy' my aunt. But\u2014and this more than ever from the day on which fine weather definitely set in at Combray\u2014the proud hour \u00b0f noon, descending from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which it blazoned for a moment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown, would long have echoed about our table, beside the 'holy bread,' which too had come in, after church, in its familiar way; and we would still be found seated in front of our Arabian Nights plates, weighed down by the heat of the day, and even more by our heavy meal. For upon the permanent foundation of eggs, cutlets, potatoes, preserves, and biscuits, whose appearance on the table she no longer announced to us, Fran\u00e7oise would add\u2014as the labour of fields and orchards, the harvest of the tides, the luck of the markets, the kindness of neighbours, and her own genius might provide; and so effectively that our bill of fare, like the quatrefoils that were carved on the porches of cathedrals in the thirteenth century, reflected to some extent the march of the seasons and the incidents of human life\u2014a brill, because the fish-woman had guaranteed its freshness; a turkey, because she had seen a beauty in the market at Roussainville-le-Pin; cardoons with marrow, because she had never done them for us in that way before; a roast leg of mutton, because the fresh air made one hungry and there would be plenty of time for it to 'settle down' in the seven hours before dinner; spinach, by way of a change; apricots, because they were still hard to get; gooseberries, because in another fortnight there would be none left; raspberries, which M. Swann had brought specially; cherries, the first to come from the cherry-tree, which had yielded none for the last two years; a cream cheese, of which in those days I was extremely fond; an almond cake, because she had ordered one the evening before; a fancy loaf, because it was our turn to 'offer' the holy bread. And when all these had been eaten, a work composed expressly for ourselves, but dedicated more particularly to my father, who had a fondness for such things, a cream of chocolate, inspired in the mind, created by the hand of Fran\u00e7oise, would be laid before us, light and fleeting as an 'occasional piece' of music, into which she had poured the whole of her talent. Anyone who refused to partake of it, saying: \"No, thank you, I have finished; I am not hungry,\" would at once have been lowered to the level of the Philistines who, when an artist makes them a present of one of his works, examine its weight and material, whereas what is of value is the creator's intention and his signature. To have left even the tiniest morsel in the dish would have shewn as much discourtesy as to rise and leave a concert hall while the 'piece' was still being played, and under the composer's-very eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At length my mother would say to me: \"Now, don't stay here all day; you can go up to your room if you are too hot outside, but get a little fresh air first; don't start reading immediately after your food.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And I would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough, ornamented here and there, like a gothic font, with a salamander, which modelled upon a background of crumbling stone the quick relief of its slender, allegorical body; on the bench without a back, in the shade of a lilac-tree, in that little corner of the garden which communicated, by a service door, with the Rue du Saint-Esprit, and from whose neglected soil rose, in two stages, an outcrop from the house itself and apparently a separate building, my aunt's back-kitchen. One could see its red-tiled floor gleaming like porphyry. It seemed not so much the cave of Fran\u00e7oise as a little temple of Venus. It would be overflowing with the offerings of the milkman, the fruiterer, the greengrocer, come sometimes from distant villages to dedicate here the first-fruits of their fields. And its roof was always surmounted by the cooing of a dove.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In earlier days I would not have lingered in the sacred grove which surrounded this temple, for, before going upstairs to read, I would steal into the little sitting-room which my uncle Adolphe, a brother of my grandfather and an old soldier who had retired from the service as a major, used to occupy on the ground floor, a room which, even when its opened windows let in the heat, if not actually the rays of the sun which seldom penetrated so far, would never fail to emit that vague and yet fresh odour, suggesting at once an open-air and an old-fashioned kind of existence, which sets and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one goes into a disused gun-room. But for some years now I had not gone into my uncle Adolphe's room, since he no longer came to Combray on account of a quarrel which had arisen between him and my family, by my fault, and in the following circumstances: Once or twice every month, in Paris, I used to be sent to pay him a. visit, as he was finishing his luncheon, wearing a plain alpaca coat, and waited upon by his servant in a working-jacket of striped linen, purple and white. He would complain that I had not been to see him for a long time; that he was being neglected; he would offer me a marchpane or a tangerine, and we would cross a room in which no one ever sat, whose fire was never lighted, whose walls were picked out with gilded mouldings, its ceiling painted blue in imitation of the sky, and its furniture upholstered in satin, as at my grandparents', only yellow; then we would enter what he called his 'study,' a room whose walls were hung with prints which shewed, against a dark background, a plump and rosy goddess driving a car, or standing upon a globe, or wearing a star on her brow; pictures which were popular under the Second Empire because there was thought to be something about them that suggested Pompeii, which were then generally despised, and which now people are beginning to collect again for one single and consistent reason (despite any others which they may advance), namely, that they suggest the Second Empire. And there I would stay with my uncle until his man came, with a message from the coachman, to ask him at what time he would like the carriage. My uncle would then be lost in meditation, while his astonished servant stood there, not daring to disturb him by the least movement, wondering and waiting for his answer, which never varied. For in the end, after a supreme crisis of hesitation, my uncle would utter, infallibly, the words: \"A quarter past two,\" which the servant would echo with amazement, but without disputing them: \"A quarter past two! Very good, sir... I will go and tell him....\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this date I was a lover of the theatre: a Platonic lover, of necessity, since my parents had not yet allowed me to enter one, and so incorrect was the picture I drew for myself of the pleasures to be enjoyed there that I almost believed that each of the spectators looked, as into a stereoscope, upon a stage and scenery which existed for himself alone, though closely resembling the thousand other spectacles presented to the rest of the audience individually.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every morning I would hasten to the Moriss column to see what new plays it announced. Nothing could be more disinterested or happier than the dreams with which these announcements filled my mind, dreams which took their form from the inevitable associations of the words forming the title of the play, and also from the colour of the bills, still damp and wrinkled with paste, on which those words stood out. Nothing, unless it were such strange titles as the Testament de C\u00e9sar Girodot, or Oedipe-Roi, inscribed not on the green bills of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, but on the wine-coloured bills of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, nothing seemed to me to differ more profoundly from the sparkling white plume of the Diamants de la Couronne than the sleek, mysterious satin of the Domino Noir and since my parents had told me that, for my first visit to the theatre, I should have to choose between these two pieces, I would study exhaustively and in turn the title of one and the title of the other (for those were all that I knew of either), attempting to snatch from each a foretaste of the pleasure which it offered me, and to compare this pleasure with that latent in the other title, until in the end I had shewn myself such vivid, such compelling pictures of, on the one hand, a play of dazzling arrogance, and on the other a gentle, velvety play, that I was as little capable of deciding which play I should prefer to see as if, at the dinner-table, they had obliged me to choose between rice \u00e0 l'Imp\u00e9ratrice and the famous cream of chocolate.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All my conversations with my playfellows bore upon actors, whose art, although as yet I had no experience of it, was the first of all its numberless forms in which Art itself allowed me to anticipate its enjoyment. Between one actor's tricks of intonation and inflection and another's, the most trifling differences would strike me as being of an incalculable importance. And from what I had been told of them I would arrange them in the order of their talent in lists which I used to murmur to myself all day long: lists which in the end became petrified in my brain and were a source of annoyance to it, being irremovable.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And later, in my schooldays, whenever I ventured in class, when the master's head was turned, to communicate with some new friend, I would always begin by asking him whether he had begun yet to go to theatres, and if he agreed that our greatest actor was undoubtedly Got, our second Delaunay, and so on. And if, in his judgment, Febvre came below Thiron, or Delaunay below Coquelin, the sudden volatility which the name of Coquelin, forsaking its stony rigidity, would engender in my mind, in which it moved upwards to the second place, the rich vitality with which the name of Delaunay would suddenly be furnished, to enable it to slip down to fourth, would stimulate and fertilise my brain with a sense of bradding and blossoming life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if the thought of actors weighed so upon me, if the sight of Maubant, coming out one afternoon from the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais, had plunged me in the throes and sufferings of hopeless love, how much more did the name of a 'star,' blazing outside the doors of a theatre, how much more, seen through the window of a brougham which passed me in the street, the hair over her forehead abloom with roses, did the face of a woman who, I would think, was perhaps an actress, leave with me a lasting disturbance, a futile and painful effort to form a picture of her private life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I classified, in order of talent, the most distinguished: Sarah Bernhardt, Berma, Bartet, Madeleine Brohan, Jeanne Samary; but I was interested in them all. Now my uncle knew many of them personally, and also ladies of another class, not clearly distinguished from actresses in my mind. He used to entertain them at his house. And if we went to see him on certain days only, that was because on the other days ladies might come whom his family could not very well have met. So we at least thought; as for my uncle, his fatal readiness to pay pretty widows (who had perhaps never been married) and countesses (whose high-sounding titles were probably no more than noms de guerre) the compliment of presenting them to my grandmother or even of presenting to them some of our family jewels, had already embroiled him more than once with my grandfather. Often, if the name of some actress were mentioned in conversation, I would hear my father say, with a smile, to my mother: \"One of your uncle's friends,\" and I would think of the weary novitiate through which, perhaps for years on end, a grown man, even a man of real importance, might have to pass, waiting on the doorstep of some such lady, while she refused to answer his letters and made her hall-porter drive him away; and imagine that my uncle was able to dispense a little jackanapes like myself from all these sufferings by introducing me in his own home to the actress, unapproachable by all the world, but for him an intimate friend.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so\u2014on the pretext that some lesson, the hour of which had been altered, now came at such an awkward time that it had already more than once prevented me, and would continue to prevent me, from seeing my uncle\u2014one day, not one of the days which he set apart for our visits, I took advantage of the fact that my parents had had luncheon earlier than usual; I slipped out and, instead of going to read the playbills on their column, for which purpose I was allowed to go out unaccompanied, I ran all the way to his house. I noticed before his door a carriage and pair, with red carnations on the horses' blinkers and in the coachman's buttonhole. As I climbed the staircase I could hear laughter and a woman's voice, and, as soon as I had rung, silence and the sound of shutting doors. The man-servant who let me in appeared embarrassed, and said that my uncle was extremely busy and probably could not see me; he went in, however, to announce my arrival, and the same voice I had heard before said: \"Oh, yes! Do let him come in; just for a moment; it will be so amusing. Is that his photograph there, on your desk? And his mother (your niece, isn't she?) beside it? The image of her, isn't he? I should so like to see the little chap, just for a second.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could hear my uncle grumbling and growing angry; finally the manservant told me to come in.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the table was the same plate of marchpanes that was always there; my uncle wore the same alpaca coat as on other days; but opposite to him, in a pink silk dress with a great necklace of pearls about her throat, sat a young woman who was just finishing a tangerine. My uncertainty whether I ought to address her as Madame or Mademoiselle made me blush, and not daring to look too much in her direction, in case I should be obliged to speak to her, I hurried across to kiss my uncle. She looked at me and smiled; my uncle said \"My nephew!\" without telling her my name or telling me hers, doubtless because, since his difficulties with my grandfather, he had endeavoured as far as possible to avoid any association of his family with this other class of acquaintance.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How like his mother he is,\" said the lady.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But you have never seen my niece, except in photographs,\" my uncle broke in quickly, with a note of anger.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I beg your pardon, dear friend, I passed her on the staircase last year when you were so ill. It is true I only saw her for a moment, and your staircase is rather dark; but I saw well enough to see how lovely she was. This young gentleman has her beautiful eyes, and also this,\" she went on, tracing a line with one finger across the lower part of her forehead. \"Tell me,\" she asked my uncle, \"is your niece Mme.\u2014\u2014; is her name the same as yours?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"He takes most after his father,\" muttered my uncle, who was no more anxious to effect an introduction by proxy, in repeating Mamma's name aloud, than to bring the two together in the flesh. \"He's his father all over, and also like my poor mother.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I have not met his father, dear,\" said the lady in pink, bowing her head slightly, \"and I never saw your poor mother. You will remember it was just after your great sorrow that we got to know one another.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt somewhat disillusioned, for this young lady was in no way different from other pretty women whom I had seen from time to time at home, especially the daughter of one of our cousins, to whose house I went every New Year's Day. Only better dressed; otherwise my uncle's friend had the same quick and kindly glance, the same frank and friendly manner. I could find no trace in her of the theatrical appearance which I admired in photographs of actresses, nothing of the diabolical expression which would have been in keeping with the life she must lead. I had difficulty in believing that this was one of 'those women,' and certainly I should never have believed her one of the 'smart ones' had I not seen the carriage and pair, the pink dress, the pearly necklace, had I not been aware, too, that my uncle knew only the very best of them. But I asked myself how the millionaire who gave her her carriage and her flat and her jewels could find any pleasure in flinging his money away upon a woman who had so simple and respectable an appearance. And yet, when I thought of what her life must be like, its immorality disturbed me more, perhaps, than if it had stood before me in some concrete and recognisable form, by its secrecy and invisibility, like the plot of a novel, the hidden truth of a scandal which had driven out of the home of her middle-class parents and dedicated to the service of all mankind which had brought to the flowering-point of her beauty, had raised to fame or notoriety this woman, the play of whose features, the intonations of whose voice, like so many others I already knew, made me regard her, in spite of myself, as a young lady of good family, her who was no longer of a family at all.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We had gone by this time into the 'study,' and my uncle, who seemed a trifle embarrassed by my presence, offered her a cigarette.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, thank you, dear friend,\" she said. \"You know I only smoke the ones the Grand Duke sends me. I tell him that they make you jealous.\" And she drew from a case cigarettes covered with inscriptions in gold, in a foreign language. \"Why, yes,\" she began again suddenly. \"Of course I have met this young man's father with you. Isn't he your nephew? How on earth could I have forgotten? He was so nice, so charming to me,\" she went on, modestly and with feeling. But when I thought to myself what must actually have been the rude greeting (which, she made out, had been so charming), I, who knew my father's coldness and reserve, was shocked, as though at some indelicacy on his part, at the contrast between the excessive recognition bestowed on it and his never adequate geniality. It has since struck me as one of the most touching aspects of the part played in life by these idle, painstaking women that they devote all their generosity, all their talent, their transferable dreams of sentimental beauty (for, like all artists, they never seek to realise the value of those dreams, or to enclose them in the four-square frame of everyday life), and their gold, which counts for little, to the fashioning of a fine and precious setting for the rubbed and scratched and ill-polished lives of men. And just as this one filled the smoking-room, where my uncle was entertaining her in his alpaca coat, with her charming person, her dress of pink silk, her pearls, and the refinement suggested by intimacy with a Grand Duke, so, in the same way, she had taken some casual remark by my father, had worked it up delicately, given it a 'turn,' a precious title, set in it the gem of a glance from her own eyes, a gem of the first water, blended of humility and gratitude; and so had given it back transformed into a jewel, a work of art, into something altogether charming.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Look here, my boy, it is time you went away,\" said my uncle.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I rose; I could scarcely resist a desire to kiss the hand of the lady in pink, but I felt that to do so would require as much audacity as a forcible abduction of her. My heart beat loud while I counted out to myself \"Shall I do it, shall I not?\" and then I ceased to ask myself what I ought to do so as at least to do something. Blindly, hotly, madly, flinging aside all the reasons I had just found to support such action, I seized and raised to my lips the hand she held out to me.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Isn't he delicious! Quite a ladies' man already; he takes after his uncle. He'll be a perfect 'gentleman,'\" she went on, setting her teeth so as to give the word a kind of English accentuation. \"Couldn't he come to me some day for 'a cup of tea,' as our friends across the channel say; he need only send me a 'blue' in the morning?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had not the least idea of what a 'blue' might be. I did not understand half the words which the lady used, but my fear lest there should be concealed in them some question which it would be impolite in me not to answer kept me from withdrawing my close attention from them, and I was beginning to feel extremely tired.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, no; it is impossible,\" said my uncle, shrugging his shoulders. \"He is kept busy at home all day; he has plenty of work to do. He brings back all the prizes from his school,\" he added in a lower tone, so that I should not hear this falsehood and interrupt with a contradiction. \"You can't tell; he may turn out a little Victor Hugo, a kind of Vaulabelle, don't you know.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I love artistic people,\" replied the lady in pink; \"there is no one like them for understanding women. Them, and really nice men like yourself. But please forgive my ignorance. Who, what is Vaulabelle? Is it those gilt books in the little glass case in your drawing-room? You know you promised to lend them to me; I will take great care of them.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My uncle, who hated lending people books, said nothing, and ushered me out into the hall. Madly in love with the lady in pink, I covered my old uncle's tobacco-stained cheeks with passionate kisses, and while he, awkwardly enough, gave me to understand (without actually saying) that he would rather I did not tell my parents about this visit, I assured him, with tears in my eyes, that his kindness had made so strong an impression upon me that some day I would most certainly find a way of expressing my gratitude. So strong an impression had it made upon me that two hours later, after a string of mysterious utterances which did not strike me as giving my parents a sufficiently clear idea of the new importance with which I had been invested, I found it simpler to let them have a full account, omitting no detail, of the visit I had paid that afternoon. In doing this I had no thought of causing my uncle any unpleasantness. How could I have thought such a thing, since I did not wish it? And I could not suppose that my parents would see any harm in a visit in which I myself saw none. Every day of our lives does not some friend or other ask us to make his apologies, without fail, to some woman to whom he has been prevented from writing; and do not we forget to do so, feeling that this woman cannot attach much importance to a silence which has none for ourselves? I imagined, like everyone else, that the brains of other people were lifeless and submissive receptacles with no power of specific reaction to any stimulus which might be applied to them; and I had not the least doubt that when I deposited in the minds of my parents the news of the acquaintance I had made at my uncle's I should at the same time transmit to them the kindly judgment I myself had based on the introduction. Unfortunately my parents had recourse to principles entirely different from those which I suggested they should adopt when they came to form their estimate of my uncle's conduct. My father and grandfather had 'words' with him of a violent order; as I learned indirectly. A few days later, passing my uncle in the street as he drove by in an open carriage, \u00ce felt at once all the grief, the gratitude, the remorse which I should have liked to convey to him. Beside the immensity of these emotions I considered that merely to raise my hat to him would be incongruous and petty, and might make him think that I regarded myself as bound to shew him no more than the commonest form of courtesy. I decided to abstain from so inadequate a gesture, and turned my head away. My uncle thought that, in doing so I was obeying my parents' orders; he never forgave them; and though he did not die until many years later, not one of us ever set eyes on him again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so I no longer used to go into the little sitting-room (now kept shut) of my uncle Adolphe; instead, after hanging about on the outskirts of the back-kitchen until Fran\u00e7oise appeared on its threshold and announced: \"I am going to let the kitchen-maid serve the coffee and take up the hot water; it is time I went off to Mme. Octave,\" I would then decide to go indoors, and would go straight upstairs to my room to read. The kitchen-maid was an abstract personality, a permanent institution to which an invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and continuity and identity throughout the long series of transitory human shapes in which that personality was incarnate; for we never found the same girl there two years running. In the year in which we ate such quantities of asparagus, the kitchen-maid whose duty it was to dress them was a poor sickly creature, some way 'gone' in pregnancy when we arrived at Combray for Easter, and it was indeed surprising that Fran\u00e7oise allowed her to run so many errands in the town and to do so much work in the house, for she was beginning to find a difficulty in bearing before her the mysterious casket, fuller and larger every day, whose splendid outline could be detected through the folds of her ample smocks. These last recalled the cloaks in which Giotto shrouds some of the allegorical figures in his paintings, of which M. Swann had given me photographs. He it was who pointed out the resemblance, and when he inquired after the kitchen-maid he would say: \"Well, how goes it with Giotto's Charity?\" And indeed the poor girl, whose pregnancy had swelled and stoutened every part of her, even to her face, and the vertical, squared outlines of her cheeks, did distinctly suggest those virgins, so strong and mannish as to seem matrons rather, in whom the Virtues are personified in the Arena Chapel. And I can see now that those Virtues and Vices of Padua resembled her in another respect as well. For just as the figure of this girl had been enlarged by the additional symbol which she carried in her body, without appearing to understand what it meant, without any rendering in her facial expression of all its beauty and spiritual significance, but carried as if it were an ordinary and rather heavy burden, so it is without any apparent suspicion of what she is about that the powerfully built housewife who is portrayed in the Arena beneath the label 'Caritas,' and a reproduction of whose portrait hung upon the wall of my schoolroom at Combray, incarnates that virtue, for it seems impossible, that any thought of charity can ever have found expression in her vulgar and energetic face. By a fine stroke of the painter's invention she is tumbling all the treasures of the earth at her feet, but exactly as if she were treading grapes in a wine-press to extract their juice, or, still more, as if she had climbed on a heap of sacks to raise herself higher; and she is holding out her flaming heart to God, or shall we say 'handing' it to Him, exactly as a cook might hand up a corkscrew through the skylight of her underground kitchen to some one who had called down to ask her for it from the ground-level above. The 'Invidia,' again, should have had some look on her face of envy. But in this fresco, too, the symbol occupies so large a place and is represented with such realism; the serpent hissing between the lips of Envy is so huge, and so completely fills her wide-opened mouth that the muscles of her face are strained and contorted, like a child's who is filling a balloon with his breath, and that Envy, and we ourselves for that matter, when we look at her, since all her attention and ours are concentrated on the action of her lips, have no time, almost, to spare for envious thoughts.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite all the admiration that M. Swann might profess for these figures of Giotto, it was a long time before I could find any pleasure in seeing in our schoolroom (where the copies he had brought me were hung) that Charity devoid of charity, that Envy who looked like nothing so much as a plate in some medical book, illustrating the compression of the glottis or uvula by a tumour in the tongue, or by the introduction of the operator's instrument, a Justice whose greyish and meanly regular features were the very same as those which adorned the faces of certain good and pious and slightly withered ladies of Combray whom I used to see at mass, many of whom had long been enrolled in the reserve forces of Injustice. But in later years I understood that the arresting strangeness, the special beauty of these frescoes lay in the great part played in each of them by its symbols, while the fact that these were depicted, not as symbols (for the thought symbolised was nowhere expressed), but as real things, actually felt or materially handled, added something more precise and more literal to their meaning, something more concrete and more striking to the lesson they imparted. And even in the case of the poor kitchen-maid, was not our attention incessantly drawn to her belly by the load which filled it; and in the same way, again, are not the thoughts of men and women in the agony of death often turned towards the practical, painful, obscure, internal, intestinal aspect, towards that 'seamy side' of death which is, as it happens, the side that death actually presents to them and forces them to feel, a side which far more closely resembles a crushing burden, a difficulty in breathing, a destroying thirst, than the abstract idea to which we are accustomed to give the name of Death?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There must have been a strong element of reality in those Virtues and Vices of Padua, since they appeared to me to be as much alive as the pregnant servant-girl, while she herself appeared scarcely less allegorical than they. And, quite possibly, this lack (or seeming lack) of participation by a person's soul in the significant marks of its own special virtue has, apart from its aesthetic meaning, a reality which, if not strictly psychological, may at least be called physiognomical. Later on, when, in the course of my life, I have had occasion to meet with, in convents for instance, literally saintly examples of practical charity, they have generally had the brisk, decided, undisturbed, and slightly brutal air of a busy surgeon, the face in which one can discern no commiseration, no tenderness at the sight of suffering humanity, and no fear of hurting it, the face devoid of gentleness or sympathy, the sublime face of true goodness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then while the kitchen-maid\u2014who, all unawares, made the superior qualities of Fran\u00e7oise shine with added lustre, just as Error, by force of contrast, enhances the triumph of Truth\u2014took in coffee which (according to Mamma) was nothing more than hot water, and then carried up to our rooms hot water which was barely tepid, I would be lying stretched out on my bed, a book in my hand, in my room which trembled with the effort to defend its frail, transparent coolness against the afternoon sun, behind its almost closed shutters through which, however, a reflection of the sunlight had contrived to slip in on its golden wings, remaining motionless, between glass and woodwork, in a corner, like a butterfly poised upon a flower. It was hardly light enough for me to read, and my feeling of the day's brightness and splendour was derived solely from the blows struck down below, in the Rue de la Cur\u00e9, by Camus (whom Fran\u00e7oise had assured that my aunt was not 'resting' and that he might therefore make a noise), upon some old packing-cases from which nothing would really be sent flying but the dust, though the din of them, in the resonant atmosphere that accompanies hot weather, seemed to scatter broadcast a rain of blood-red stars; and from the flies who performed for my benefit, in their small concert, as it might be the chamber music of summer; evoking heat and light quite differently from an air of human music which, if you happen to have heard it during a fine summer, will always bring that summer back to your mind, the flies' music is bound to the season by a closer, a more vital tie\u2014born of sunny days, and not to be reborn but with them, containing something of their essential nature, it not merely calls up their image in our memory, but gives us a guarantee that they do really exist, that they are close around us, immediately accessible.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This dim freshness of my room was to the broad daylight of the street what the shadow is to the sunbeam, that is to say, equally luminous, and presented to my imagination the entire panorama of summer, which my senses, if I had been out walking, could have tasted and enjoyed in fragments only; and so was quite in harmony with my state of repose, which (thanks to the adventures related in my books, which had just excited it) bore, like a hand reposing motionless in a stream of running water, the shock and animation of a torrent of activity and life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But my grandmother, even if the weather, after growing too hot, had broken, and a storm, or just a shower, had burst over us, would come up and beg me to go outside. And as I did not wish to leave off my book, I would go on with it in the garden, under the chestnut-tree, in a little sentry-box of canvas and matting, in the farthest recesses of which I used to sit and feel that I was hidden from the eyes of anyone who might be coming to call upon the family.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then my thoughts, did not they form a similar sort of hiding-hole, in the depths of which I felt that I could bury myself and remain invisible even when I was looking at what went on outside? When I saw any external object, my consciousness that I was seeing it would remain between me and it, enclosing it in a slender, incorporeal outline which prevented me from ever coming directly in contact with the material form; for it would volatilise itself in some way before I could touch it, just as an incandescent body which is moved towards something wet never actually touches moisture, since it is always preceded, itself, by a zone of evaporation. Upon the sort of screen, patterned with different states and impressions, which my consciousness would quietly unfold while I was reading, and which ranged from the most deeply hidden aspirations of my heart to the wholly external view of the horizon spread out before my eyes at the foot of the garden, what was from the first the most permanent and the most intimate part of me, the lever whose incessant movements controlled all the rest, was my belief in the philosophic richness and beauty of the book I was reading, and my desire to appropriate these to myself, whatever the book might be. For even if I had purchased it at Combray, having seen it outside Borange's, whose grocery lay too far from our house for Fran\u00e7oise to be able to deal there, as she did with Camus, but who enjoyed better custom as a stationer and bookseller; even if I had seen it, tied with string to keep it in its place in the mosaic of monthly parts and pamphlets which adorned either side of his doorway, a doorway more mysterious, more teeming with suggestion than that of a cathedral, I should have noticed and bought it there simply because I had recognised it as a book which had been well spoken of, in my hearing, by the school-master or the school-friend who, at that particular time, seemed to me to be entrusted with the secret of Truth and Beauty, things half-felt by me, half-incomprehensible, the full understanding of which was the vague but permanent object of my thoughts.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next to this central belief, which, while I was reading, would be constantly a motion from my inner self to the outer world, towards the discovery of Truth, came the emotions aroused in me by the action in which I would be taking part, for these afternoons were crammed with more dramatic and sensational events than occur, often, in a whole lifetime. These were the events which took place in the book I was reading. It is true that the people concerned in them were not what Fran\u00e7oise would have called 'real people.' But none of the feelings which the joys or misfortunes of a 'real' person awaken in us can be awakened except through a mental picture of those joys or misfortunes; and the ingenuity of the first novelist lay in his understanding that, as the picture was the one essential element in the complicated structure of our emotions, so that simplification of it which consisted in the suppression, pure and simple, of 'real' people would be a decided improvement. A 'real' person, profoundly as we may sympathise with him, is in a great measure perceptible only through our senses, that is to say, he remains opaque, offers a dead weight which our sensibilities have not the strength to lift. If some misfortune comes to him, it is only in one small section of the complete idea we have of him that we are capable of feeling any emotion; indeed it is only in one small section of the complete idea he has of himself that he is capable of feeling any emotion either. The novelist's happy discovery was to think of substituting for those opaque sections, impenetrable by the human spirit, their equivalent in immaterial sections, things, that is, which the spirit can assimilate to itself. After which it matters not that the actions, the feelings of this new order of creatures appear to us in the guise of truth, since we have made them our own, since it is in ourselves that they are happening, that they are holding in thrall, while we turn over, feverishly, the pages of the book, our quickened breath and staring eyes. And once the novelist has brought us to that state, in which, as in all purely mental states, every emotion is multiplied ten-fold, into which his book comes to disturb us as might a dream, but a dream more lucid, and of a more lasting impression than those which come to us in sleep; why, then, for the space of an hour he sets free within us all the joys and sorrows in the world, a few of which, only, we should have to spend years of our actual life in getting to know, and the keenest, the most intense of which would never have been revealed to us because the slow course of their development stops our perception of them. It is the same in life; the heart changes, and that is our worst misfortune; but we learn of it only from reading or by imagination; for in reality its alteration, like that of certain natural phenomena, is so gradual that, even if we are able to distinguish, successively, each of its different states, we are still spared the actual sensation of change.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next to, but distinctly less intimate a part of myself than this human element, would come the view, more or less projected before my eyes, of the country in which the action of the story was taking place, which made a far stronger impression on my mind than the other, the actual landscape which would meet my eyes when I raised them from my book. In this way, for two consecutive summers I used to sit in the heat of our Combray garden, sick with a longing inspired by the book I was then reading for a land of mountains and rivers, where I could see an endless vista of sawmills, where beneath the limpid currents fragments of wood lay mouldering in beds of watercress; and nearby, rambling and clustering along low walls, purple flowers and red. And since there was always lurking in my mind the dream of a woman who would enrich me with her love, that dream in those two summers used to be quickened with the freshness and coolness of running water; and whoever she might be, the woman whose image I called to mind, purple flowers and red would at once spring up on either side of her like complementary colours.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was not only because an image of which we dream remains for ever distinguished, is adorned and enriched by the association of colours not its own which may happen to surround it in our mental picture; for the scenes in the books I read were to me not merely scenery more vividly portrayed by my imagination than any which Combray could spread before my eyes but otherwise of the same kind. Because of the selection that the author had made of them, because of the spirit of faith in which my mind would exceed and anticipate his printed word, as it might be interpreting a revelation, these scenes used to give me the impression\u2014one which I hardly ever derived from any place in which I might happen to be, and never from our garden, that undistinguished product of the strictly conventional fantasy of the gardener whom my grandmother so despised\u2014of their being actually part of Nature herself, and worthy to be studied and explored.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had my parents allowed me, when I read a book, to pay a visit to the country it described, I should have felt that I was making an enormous advance towards the ultimate conquest of truth. For even if we have the sensation of being always enveloped in, surrounded by our own soul, still it does not seem a fixed and immovable prison; rather do we seem to be borne away with it, and perpetually struggling to pass beyond it, to break out into the world, with a perpetual discouragement as we hear endlessly, all around us, that unvarying sound which is no echo from without, but the resonance of a vibration from within. We try to discover in things, endeared to us on that account, the spiritual glamour which we ourselves have cast upon them; we are disillusioned, and learn that they are in themselves barren and devoid of the charm which they owed, in our minds, to the association of certain ideas; sometimes we mobilise all our spiritual forces in a glittering array so as to influence and subjugate other human beings who, as we very well know, are situated outside ourselves, where we can never reach them. And so, if I always imagined the woman I loved as in a setting of whatever places I most longed, at the time, to visit; if in my secret longings it was she who attracted me to them, who opened to me the gate of an unknown world, that was not by the mere hazard of a simple association of thoughts; no, it was because my dreams of travel and of love were only moments\u2014which I isolate artificially to-day as though I were cutting sections, at different heights, in a jet of water, rainbow-flashing but seemingly without flow or motion\u2014were only drops in a single, undeviating, irresistible outrush of all the forces of my life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, as I continue to trace the outward course of these impressions from their close-packed intimate source in my consciousness, and before I come to the horizon of reality which envelops them, I discover pleasures of another kind, those of being comfortably seated, of tasting the good scent on the air, of not being disturbed by any visitor; and, when an hour chimed from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, of watching what was already spent of the afternoon fall drop by drop until I heard the last stroke which enabled me to add up the total sum, after which the silence that followed seemed to herald the beginning, in the blue sky above me, of that long part of the day still allowed me for reading, until the good dinner which Fran\u00e7oise was even now preparing should come to strengthen and refresh me after the strenuous pursuit of its hero through the pages of my book. And, as each hour struck, it would seem to me that a few seconds only had passed since the hour before; the latest would inscribe itself, close to its predecessor, on the sky's surface, and I would be unable to believe that sixty minutes could be squeezed into the tiny arc of blue which was comprised between their two golden figures. Sometimes it would even happen that this precocious hour would sound two strokes more than the last; there must then have been an hour which I had not heard strike; something which had taken place had not taken place for me; the fascination of my book, a magic as potent as the deepest slumber, had stopped my enchanted ears and had obliterated the sound of that golden bell from the azure surface of the enveloping silence. Sweet Sunday afternoons beneath the chestnut-tree in our Combray garden, from which I was careful to eliminate every commonplace incident of my actual life, replacing them by a career of strange adventures and ambitions in a land watered by living streams, you still recall those adventures and ambitions to my mind when I think of you, and you embody and preserve them by virtue of having little by little drawn round and enclosed them (while I went on with my book and the heat of the day declined) in the gradual crystallisation, slowly altering in form and dappled with a pattern of chestnut-leaves, of your silent, sonorous, fragrant, limpid hours.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I would be torn from my book, in the middle of the afternoon, by the gardener's daughter, who came running like a mad thing, overturning an orange-tree in its tub, cutting a finger, breaking a tooth, and screaming out \"They're coming, they're coming!\" so that Fran\u00e7oise and I should run too and not miss anything of the show. That was on days when the cavalry stationed in Combray went out for some military exercise, going as a rule by the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde. While our servants, sitting in a row on their chairs outside the garden railings, stared at the people of Combray taking their Sunday walks and were stared at in return, the gardener's daughter, through the gap which there was between two houses far away in the Avenue de la Gare, would have spied the glitter of helmets. The servants then hurried in with their chairs, for when the troopers filed through the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde they filled it from side to side, and their jostling horses scraped against the walls of the houses, covering and drowning the pavements like banks which present too narrow a channel to a river in flood.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Poor children,\" Fran\u00e7oise would exclaim, in tears almost before she had reached the railings; \"poor boys, to be mown down like grass in a meadow. It's just shocking to think of,\" she would go on, laying a hand over her heart, where presumably she had felt the shock.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A fine sight, isn't it, Mme. Fran\u00e7oise, all these young fellows not caring two straws for their lives?\" the gardener would ask, just to 'draw' her. And he would not have spoken in vain.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Not caring for their lives, is it? Why, what in the world is there that we should care for if it's not our lives, the only gift the Lord never offers us a second time? Oh dear, oh dear; you're right all the same; it's quite true, they don't care! I can remember them in '70; in those wretched wars they've no fear of death left in them; they're nothing more nor less than madmen; and then they aren't worth the price of a rope to hang them with; they're not men any more, they're lions.\" For by her way of thinking, to compare a man with a lion, which she used to pronounce 'lie-on,' was not at all complimentary to the man.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Rue Sainte-Hildegarde turned too sharply for us to be able to see people approaching at any distance, and it was only through the gap between those two houses in the Avenue de la Gare that we could still make out fresh helmets racing along towards us, and flashing in the sunlight. The gardener wanted to know whether there were still many to come, and he was thirsty besides, with the sun beating down upon his head. So then, suddenly, his daughter would leap out, as though from a beleaguered city, would make a sortie, turn the street corner, and, having risked her life a hundred times over, reappear and bring us, with a jug of liquorice-water, the news that there were still at least a thousand of them, pouring along without a break from the direction of Thiberzy and M\u00e9s\u00e9glise. Fran\u00e7oise and the gardener, having 'made up' their difference, would discuss the line to be followed in case of war.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't you see, Fran\u00e7oise,\" he would say. \"Revolution would be better, because then no one would need to join in unless he liked.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, yes, I can see that, certainly; it's more straightforward.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The gardener believed that, as soon as war was declared, they would stop all the railways.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, to be sure; so that we sha'n't get away,\" said Fran\u00e7oise.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the gardener would assent, with \"Ay, they're the cunning ones,\" for he would not allow that war was anything but a kind of trick which the state attempted to play on the people, or that there was a man in the world who would not run away from it if he had the chance to do so.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Fran\u00e7oise would hasten back to my aunt, and I would return to my book, and the servants would take their places again outside the gate to watch the dust settle on the pavement, and the excitement caused by the passage of the soldiers subside. Long after order had been restored, an abnormal tide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of Corn-bray. And in front of every house, even of those where it was not, as a rule, 'done,' the servants, and sometimes even the masters would sit and stare, festooning their doorsteps with a dark, irregular fringe, like the border of shells and sea-weed which a stronger tide than usual leaves on the beach, as though trimming it with embroidered crape, when the sea itself has retreated.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Except on such days as these, however, I would as a rule be left to read in peace. But the interruption which a visit from Swann once made, and the commentary which he then supplied to the course of my reading, which had brought me to the work of an author quite new to me, called Bergotte, had this definite result that for a long time afterwards it was not against a wall gay with spikes of purple blossom, but on a wholly different background, the porch of a gothic cathedral, that I would see outlined the figure of one of the women of whom I dreamed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had heard Bergotte spoken of, for the first time, by a friend older than myself, for whom I had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the name of Bloch. Hearing me confess my love of the Nuit d'Octobre, he had burst out in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me, by way of warning: \"You must conquer your vile taste for A. de Musset, Esquire. He is a bad egg, one of the very worst, a pretty detestable specimen. I am bound to admit, natheless,\" he added graciously, \"that he, and even the man Racine, did, each of them, once in his life, compose a line which is not only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is in my eyes the supreme merit of meaning absolutely nothing. One is\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0La blanche Oloossone et la blanche Camire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0La fille de Minos et de Pasipha\u00eb.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They were submitted to my judgment, as evidence for the defence of the two runagates, in an article by my very dear master Father Lecomte, who is found pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods. By which token, here is a book which I have not the time, just now, to read, a book recommended, it would seem, by that colossal fellow. He regards, or so they tell me, its author, one Bergotte, Esquire, as a subtle scribe, more subtle, indeed, than any beast of the field; and, albeit he exhibits on occasion a critical pacifism, a tenderness in suffering fools, for which it is impossible to account, and hard to make allowance, still his word has weight with me as it were the Delphic Oracle. Read you then this lyrical prose, and, if the Titanic master-builder of rhythm who composed Bhagavat and the L\u00e9vrier de Magnus speaks not falsely, then, by Apollo, you may taste, even you, my master, the ambrosial joys of Olympus.\" It was in an ostensible vein of sarcasm that he had asked me to call him, and that he himself called me, \"my master.\" But, as a matter of fact, we each derived a certain amount of satisfaction from the mannerism, being still at the age in which one believes that one gives a thing real existence by giving it a name.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately I was not able to set at rest, by further talks with Bloch, in which I might have insisted upon an explanation, the doubts he had engendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry (from which I, if you please, expected nothing less than the revelation of truth itself) were all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing. For, as it happened, Bloch was not invited to the house again. At first, he had been well received there. It is true that my grandfather made out that, whenever I formed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and brought him home with me, that friend was invariably a Jew; to which he would not have objected on principle\u2014indeed his own friend Swann was of Jewish extraction\u2014had he not found that the Jews whom I chose as friends were not usually of the best type. And so I was hardly ever able to bring a new friend home without my grandfather's humming the \"O, God of our fathers\" from La Juive, or else \"Israel, break thy chain,\" singing the tune alone, of course, to an \"um-ti-tum-ti-tum, tra-la\"; but I used to be afraid of my friend's recognising the sound, and so being able to reconstruct the words.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before seeing them, merely on hearing their names, about which, as often as not, there was nothing particularly Hebraic, he would divine not only the Jewish origin of such of my friends as might indeed be of the chosen people, but even some dark secret which was hidden in their family.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And what do they call your friend who is coming this evening?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Dumont, grandpapa.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Dumont! Oh, I'm frightened of Dumont.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he would sing:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Archers, be on your guard!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Watch without rest, without sound.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, after a few adroit questions on points of detail, he would call out \"On guard! on guard,\" or, if it were the victim himself who had already arrived, and had been obliged, unconsciously, by my grandfather's subtle examination, to admit his origin, then my grandfather, to shew us that he had no longer any doubts, would merely look at us, humming almost inaudibly the air of\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  What! do you hither guide the feet\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of this timid Israelite?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or of\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sweet vale of Hebron, dear paternal fields\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or, perhaps, of\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I am of the chosen race\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These little eccentricities on my grandfather's part implied no ill-will whatsoever towards my friends. But Bloch had displeased my family for other reasons. He had begun by annoying my father, who, seeing him come in with wet clothes, had asked him with keen interest:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, M. Bloch, is there a change in the weather; has it been raining? I can't understand it; the barometer has been 'set fair.'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which drew from Bloch nothing more instructive than \"Sir, I am absolutely incapable of telling you whether it has rained. I live so resolutely apart from physical contingencies that my senses no longer trouble to inform me of them.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My poor boy,\" said my father after Bloch had gone, \"your friend is out of his mind. Why, he couldn't even tell me what the weather was like. As if there could be anything more interesting! He is an imbecile.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, Bloch had displeased my grandmother because, after luncheon, when she complained of not feeling very well, he had stifled a sob and wiped the tears from his eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You cannot imagine that he is sincere,\" she observed to me. \"Why he doesn't know me. Unless he's mad, of course.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour and a half late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot, and made not the least apology, saying merely: \"I never allow myself to be influenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or by the arbitrary divisions of what is known as Time. I would willingly reintroduce to society the opium pipe of China or the Malayan kriss, but I am wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more pernicious (besides being quite bleakly bourgeois) implements, the umbrella and the watch.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In spite of all this he would still have been received at Combray. He was, of course, hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for me; they had, in the end, decided that the tears which he had shed on hearing of my grandmother's illness were genuine enough; but they knew, either instinctively or from their own experience, that our early impulsive emotions have but little influence over our later actions and the conduct of our lives; and that regard for moral obligations, loyalty to our friends, patience in finishing our work, obedience to a rule of life, have a surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly followed than in these momentary transports, ardent but sterile. They would have preferred to Bloch, as companions for myself, boys who would have given me no more than it is proper, by all the laws of middle-class morality, for boys to give one another, who would not unexpectedly send me a basket of fruit because they happened, that morning, to have thought of me with affection, but who, since they were incapable of inclining in my favour, by any single impulse of their imagination and emotions, the exact balance of the duties and claims of friendship, were as incapable of loading the scales to my prejudice. Even the injuries we do them will not easily divert from the path of their duty towards us those conventional natures of which my great-aunt furnished a type: who, after quarrelling for years with a niece, to whom she never spoke again, yet made no change in the will in which she had left that niece the whole of her fortune, because she was her next-of-kin, and it was the 'proper thing' to do.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But I was fond of Bloch; my parents wished me to be happy; and the insoluble problems which I set myself on such texts as the 'absolutely meaningless' beauty of La fille de Minos et de Pasipha\u00ebtired me more and made me more unwell than I should have been after further talks with him, unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother's mind. And he would still have been received at Combray but for one thing. That same night, after dinner, having informed me (a piece of news which had a great influence on my later life, making it happier at one time and then more unhappy) that no woman ever thought of anything but love, and that there was not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome, he had gone on to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable authority that my great-aunt herself had led a 'gay' life in her younger days, and had been notoriously 'kept.' I could not refrain from passing on so important a piece of information to my parents; the next time Bloch called he was not admitted, and afterwards, when I met him in the street, he greeted me with extreme coldness.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But in the matter of Bergotte he had spoken truly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the first few days, like a tune which will be running in one's head and maddening one soon enough, but of which one has not for the moment 'got hold,' the things I was to love so passionately in Bergotte's style had not yet caught my eye. I could not, it is true, lay down the novel of his which I was reading, but I fancied that I was interested in the story alone, as in the first dawn of love, when we go every day to meet a woman at some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine it is that we are attracted. Then I observed the rare, almost archaic phrases which he liked to employ at certain points, where a hidden flow of harmony, a prelude contained and concealed in the work itself would animate and elevate his style; and it was at such points as these, too, that he would begin to speak of the \"vain dream of life,\" of the \"inexhaustible torrent of fair forms,\" of the \"sterile, splendid torture of understanding and loving,\" of the \"moving effigies which ennoble for all time the charming and venerable fronts of our cathedrals\"; that he would express a whole system of philosophy, new to me, by the use of marvellous imagery, to the inspiration of which I would naturally have ascribed that sound of harping which began to chime and echo in my ears, an accompaniment to which that imagery added something ethereal and sublime. One of these passages of Bergotte, the third or fourth which I had detached from the rest, filled me with a joy to which the meagre joy I had tasted in the first passage bore no comparison, a joy which I felt myself to have experienced in some innermost chamber of my soul, deep, undivided, vast, from which all obstructions and partitions seemed to have been swept away. For what had happened was that, while I recognised in this passage the same taste for uncommon phrases, the same bursts of music, the same idealist philosophy which had been present in the earlier passages without my having taken them into account as the source of my pleasure, I now no longer had the impression of being confronted by a particular passage in one of Bergotte's works, which traced a purely bi-dimensional figure in outline upon the surface of my mind, but rather of the 'ideal passage' of Bergotte, common to every one of his books, and to which all the earlier, similar passages, now becoming merged in it, had added a kind of density and volume, by which my own understanding seemed to be enlarged.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was by no means Bergotte's sole admirer; he was the favourite writer also of a friend of my mother's, a highly literary lady; while Dr. du Boulbon had kept all his patients waiting until he finished Bergotte's latest volume; and it was from his consulting room, and from a house in a park near Combray that some of the first seeds were scattered of that taste for Bergotte, a rare-growth in those days, but now so universally acclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout Europe and America, and even in the tiniest villages, rare still in its refinement, but in that alone. What my mother's friend, and, it would seem, what Dr. du Boulbon liked above all in the writings of Bergotte was just what I liked, the same flow of melody, the same old-fashioned phrases, and certain others, quite simple and familiar, but so placed by him, in such prominence, as to hint at a particular quality of taste on his part; and also, in the sad parts of his books, a sort of roughness, a tone that was almost harsh. And he himself, no doubt, realised that these were his principal attractions. For in his later books, if he had hit upon some great truth, or upon the name of an historic cathedral, he would break off his narrative, and in an invocation, an apostrophe, a lengthy prayer, would give a free outlet to that effluence which, in the earlier volumes, remained buried beneath the form of his prose, discernible only in a rippling of its surface, and perhaps even more delightful, more harmonious when it was thus veiled from the eye, when the reader could give no precise indication of where the murmur of the current began, or of where it died away. These passages in which he delighted were our favourites also. For my own part I knew all of them by heart. I felt even disappointed when he resumed the thread of his narrative. Whenever he spoke of something whose beauty had until then remained hidden from me, of pine-forests or of hailstorms, of Notre-Dame de Paris, of Athalie, or of Ph\u00e8dre, by some piece of imagery he would make their beauty explode and drench me with its essence. And so, dimly realising that the universe contained innumerable elements which my feeble senses would be powerless to discern, did he not bring them within my reach, I wished that I might have his opinion, some metaphor of his, upon everything in the world, and especially upon such things as I might have an opportunity, some day, of seeing for myself; and among such things, more particularly still upon some of the historic buildings of France, upon certain views of the sea, because the emphasis with which, in his books, he referred to these shewed that he regarded them as rich in significance and beauty. But, alas, upon almost everything in the world his opinion was unknown to me. I had no doubt that it would differ entirely from my own, since his came down from an unknown sphere towards which I was striving to raise myself; convinced that my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected spirit, I had so completely obliterated them all that, if I happened to find in one of his books something which had already occurred to my own mind, my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity had, in his infinite bounty, restored it to me, had pronounced it to be beautiful and right. It happened now and then that a page of Bergotte would express precisely those ideas which I used often at night, when I was unable to sleep, to write to my grandmother and mother, and so concisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of mottoes for me to set at the head of my letters. And so too, in later years, when I began to compose a book of my own, and the quality of some of my sentences seemed so inadequate that I could not make up my mind to go on with the undertaking, I would find the equivalent of my sentences in Bergotte's. But it was only then, when I read them in his pages, that I could enjoy them; when it was I myself who composed them, in my anxiety that they should exactly reproduce what I seemed to have detected in my mind, and in my fear of their not turning out 'true to life,' I had no time to ask myself whether what I was writing would be pleasant to read! But indeed there was no kind of language, no kind of ideas which I really liked, except these. My feverish and unsatisfactory attempts were themselves a token of my love, a love which brought me no pleasure, but was, for all that, intense and deep. And so, when I came suddenly upon similar phrases in the writings of another, that is to say stripped of their familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and self-tormentings, I was free to indulge to the full my own appetite for such things, just as a cook who, once in a while, has no dinner to prepare for other people, can then find time to gormandise himself. And so, when I had found, one day, in a book by Bergotte, some joke about an old family servant, to which his solemn and magnificent style added a great deal of irony, but which was in principle what I had often said to my grandmother about Fran\u00e7oise, and when, another time, I had discovered that he thought not unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of absolute Truth which were his writings, a remark similar to one which I had had occasion to make on our friend M. Legrandin (and, moreover, my remarks on Fran\u00e7oise and M. Legrandin were among those which I would most resolutely have sacrificed for Bergotte's sake, in the belief that he would find them quite without interest); then it was suddenly revealed to me that my own humble existence and the Realms of Truth were less widely separated than I had supposed, that at certain points they were actually in contact; and in my new-found confidence and joy I wept upon his printed page, as in the arms of a long-lost father.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From his books I had formed an impression of Bergotte as a frail and disappointed old man, who had lost his children, and had never found any consolation. And so I would read, or rather sing his sentences in my brain, with rather more dolce, rather more lento than he himself had, perhaps, intended, and his simplest phrase would strike my ears with something peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation. More than anything else in the world I cherished his philosophy, and had pledged myself to it in lifelong devotion. It made me impatient to reach the age when I should be eligible to attend the class at school called 'Philosophy.' I did not wish to learn or do anything else there, but simply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of Bergotte, and, if I had been told then that the metaphysicians whom I was actually to follow there resembled him in nothing, I should have been struck down by the despair a young lover feels who has sworn lifelong fidelity, when a friend speaks to him of the other mistresses he will have in time to come.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One Sunday, while I was reading in the garden, I was interrupted by Swann, who had come to call upon my parents.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What are you reading? May I look? Why, it's Bergotte! Who has been telling you about him?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I replied that Bloch was responsible.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, yes, that boy I saw here once, who looks so like the Bellini portrait of Mahomet II. It's an astonishing likeness; he has the same arched eyebrows and hooked nose and prominent cheekbones. When his beard comes he'll be Mahomet himself. Anyhow he has good taste, for Bergotte is a charming creature.\" And seeing how much I seemed to admire Bergotte, Swann, who never spoke at all about the people he knew, made an exception in my favour and said: \"I know him well; if you would like him to write a few words on the title-page of your book I could ask him for you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I dared not accept such an offer, but bombarded Swann with questions about his friend. \"Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Actor? No, I can't say. But I do know this: there's not a man on the stage whom he thinks equal to Berma; he puts her above everyone. Have you seen her?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, sir, my parents do not allow me to go to the theatre.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That is a pity. You should insist. Berma in Ph\u00e8dre, in the Cid; well, she's only an actress, if you like, but you know that I don't believe very much in the 'hierarchy' of the arts.\" As he spoke I noticed, what had often struck me before in his conversations with my grandmother's sisters, that whenever he spoke of serious matters, whenever he used an expression which seemed to imply a definite opinion upon some important subject, he would take care to isolate, to sterilise it by using a special intonation, mechanical and ironic, as though he had put the phrase or word between inverted commas, and was anxious to disclaim any personal responsibility for it; as who should say \"the 'hierarchy,' don't you know, as silly people call it.\" But then, if it was so absurd, why did he say the 'hierarchy'? A moment later he went on: \"Her acting will give you as noble an inspiration as any masterpiece of art in the world, as\u2014oh, I don't know\u2014\" and he began to laugh, \"shall we say the Queens of Chartres?\" Until then I had supposed that his horror of having to give a serious opinion was something Parisian and refined, in contrast to the provincial dogmatism of my grandmother's sisters; and I had imagined also that it was characteristic of the mental attitude towards life of the circle in which Swann moved, where, by a natural reaction from the 'lyrical' enthusiasms of earlier generations, an excessive importance was given to small and precise facts, formerly regarded as vulgar, and anything in the nature of 'phrase-making' was banned. But now I found myself slightly shocked by this attitude which Swann invariably adopted when face to face with generalities. He appeared unwilling to risk even having an opinion, and to be at his ease only when he could furnish, with meticulous accuracy, some precise but unimportant detail. But in so doing he did not take into account that even here he was giving an opinion, holding a brief (as they say) for something, that the accuracy of his details had an importance of its own. I thought again of the dinner that night, when I had been so unhappy because Mamma would not be coming up to my room, and when he had dismissed the balls given by the Princesse de L\u00e9on as being of no importance. And yet it was to just that sort of amusement that he was devoting his life. For what other kind of existence did he reserve the duties of saying in all seriousness what he thought about things, of formulating judgments which he would not put between inverted commas; and when would he cease to give himself up to occupations of which at the same, time he made out that they were absurd? I noticed, too, in the manner in which Swann spoke to me of Bergotte, something which, to do him justice, was not peculiar to himself, but was shared by all that writer's admirers at that time, at least by my mother's friend and by Dr. du Boulbon. Like Swann, they would say of Bergotte: \"He has a charming mind, so individual, he has a way of his own of saying things, which is a little far-fetched, but so pleasant. You never need to look for his name on the title-page, you can tell his work at once.\" But none of them had yet gone so far as to say \"He is a great writer, he has great talent.\" They did not even credit him with talent at all. They did not speak, because they were not aware of it. We are very slow in recognising in the peculiar physiognomy of a new writer the type which is labelled 'great talent' in our museum of general ideas. Simply because that physiognomy is new and strange, we can find in it no resemblance to what we are accustomed to call talent. We say rather originality, charm, delicacy, strength; and then one day we add up the sum of these, and find that it amounts simply to talent.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Are there any books in which Bergotte has written about Berma?\" I asked M. Swann.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think he has, in that little essay on Racine, but it must be out of print. Still, there has perhaps been a second impression. I will find out. Anyhow, I can ask Bergotte himself all that you want to know next time he comes to dine with us. He never misses a week, from one year's end to another. He is my daughter's greatest friend. They go about together, and look at old towns and cathedrals and castles.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I was still completely ignorant of the different grades in the social hierarchy, the fact that my father found it impossible for us to see anything of Swann's wife and daughter had, for a long time, had the contrary effect of making me imagine them as separated from us by an enormous gulf, which greatly enhanced their dignity and importance in my eyes. I was sorry that my mother did not dye her hair and redden her lips, as I had heard our neighbour, Mme. Sazerat, say that Mme. Swann did, to gratify not her husband but M. de Charlus; and I felt that, to her, we must be an object of scorn, which distressed me particularly on account of the daughter, such a pretty little girl, as I had heard, and one of whom I used often to dream, always imagining her with the same features and appearance, which I bestowed upon her quite arbitrarily, but with a charming effect. But from this afternoon, when I had learned that Mile. Swann was a creature living in such rare and fortunate circumstances, bathed, as in her natural element, in such a sea of privilege that, if she should ask her parents whether anyone were coming to dinner, she would be answered in those two syllables, radiant with celestial light, would hear the name of that golden guest who was to her no more than an old friend of her family, Bergotte; that for her the intimate conversation at table, corresponding to what my great-aunt's conversation was for me, would be the words of Bergotte upon all those subjects which he had not been able to take up in his writings, and on which I would fain have heard him utter oracles; and that, above all, when she went to visit other towns, he would be walking by her side, unrecognised and glorious, like the gods who came down, of old, from heaven to dwell among mortal men: then I realised both the rare worth of a creature such as Mile. Swann, and, at the same time, how coarse and ignorant I should appear to her; and I felt so keenly how pleasant and yet how impossible it would be for me to become her friend that I was filled at once with longing and with despair. And usually, from this time forth, when I thought of her, I would see her standing before the porch of a cathedral, explaining to me what each of the statues meant, and, with a smile which was my highest commendation, presenting me, as her friend, to Bergotte. And invariably the charm of all the fancies which the thought of cathedrals used to inspire in me, the charm of the hills and valleys of the He de France and of the plains of Normandy, would radiate brightness and beauty over the picture I had formed in my mind of Mile. Swann; nothing more remained but to know and to love her. Once we believe that a fellow-creature has a share in some unknown existence to which that creature's love for ourselves can win us admission, that is, of all the preliminary conditions which Love exacts, the one to which he attaches most importance, the one which makes him generous or indifferent as to the rest. Even those women who pretend that they judge a man by his exterior only, see in that exterior an emanation from some special way of life. And that is why they fall in love with a soldier or a fireman, whose uniform makes them less particular about his face; they kiss and believe that beneath the crushing breastplate there beats a heart different from the rest, more gallant, more adventurous, more tender; and so it is that a young king or a crown prince may travel in foreign countries and make the most gratifying conquests, and yet lack entirely that regular and classic profile which would be indispensable, I dare say, in an outside-broker.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I was reading in the garden, a thing my great-aunt would never have understood my doing save on a Sunday, that being the day on which it was unlawful to indulge in any serious occupation, and on which she herself would lay aside her sewing (on a week-day she would have said, \"How you can go on amusing yourself with a book; it isn't Sunday, you know!\" putting into the word 'amusing' an implication of childishness and waste of time), my aunt L\u00e9onie would be gossiping with Fran\u00e7oise until it was time for Eulalie to arrive. She would tell her that she had just seen Mme. Goupil go by \"without an umbrella, in the silk dress she had made for her the other day at Ch\u00e2teaudun. If she has far to go before vespers, she may get it properly soaked.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Very likely\" (which meant also \"very likely not\") was the answer, for Fran\u00e7oise did not wish definitely to exclude the possibility of a happier alternative\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There, now,\" went on my aunt, beating her brow, \"that reminds me that I never heard if she got to church this morning before the Elevation. I must remember to ask Eulalie... Fran\u00e7oise, just look at that black cloud behind the steeple, and how poor the light is on the slates, you may be certain it will rain before the day is out. It couldn't possibly keep on like this, it's been too hot. And the sooner the better, for until the storm breaks my Vichy water won't 'go down,'\" she concluded, since, in her mind, the desire to accelerate the digestion of her Vichy water was of infinitely greater importance than her fear of seeing Mme. Goupil's new dress ruined.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Very likely.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And you know that when it rains in the Square there's none too much shelter.\" Suddenly my aunt turned pale. \"What, three o'clock!\" she exclaimed. \"But vespers will have begun already, and I've forgotten my pepsin! Now I know why that Vichy water has been lying on my stomach.\" And falling precipitately upon a prayer-book bound in purple velvet, with gilt clasps, out of which in her haste she let fall a shower of the little pictures, each in a lace fringe of yellowish paper, which she used to mark the places of the greater feasts of the church, my aunt, while she swallowed her drops, began at full speed to mutter the words of the sacred text, its meaning being slightly clouded in her brain by the uncertainty whether the pepsin, when taken so long after the Vichy, would still be able to overtake it and to 'send it down.' \"Three o'clock! It's unbelievable how time flies.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A little tap at the window, as though some missile had struck it, followed by a plentiful, falling sound, as light, though, as if a shower of sand were being sprinkled from a window overhead; then the fall spread, took on an order, a rhythm, became liquid, loud, drumming, musical, innumerable, universal. It was the rain.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There, Fran\u00e7oise, what did I tell you? How it's coming down! But I think I heard the bell at the garden gate: go along and see who can be outside in this weather.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise went and returned. \"It's Mme. Am\u00e9d\u00e9e\" (my grandmother). \"She said she was going for a walk. It's raining hard, all the same.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm not at all surprised,\" said my aunt, looking up towards the sky. \"I've always said that she was not in the least like other people. Well, I'm glad it's she and not myself who's outside in all this.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Mme. Am\u00e9d\u00e9e is always the exact opposite of the rest,\" said Fran\u00e7oise, not unkindly, refraining until she should be alone with the other servants from stating her belief that my grandmother was 'a bit off her head.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There's Benediction over! Eulalie will never come now,\" sighed my aunt. \"It will be the weather that's frightened her away.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But it's not five o'clock yet, Mme. Octave, it's only half-past four.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Only half-past four! And here am I, obliged to draw back the small curtains, just to get a tiny streak of daylight. At half-past four! Only a week before the Rogation-days. Ah, my poor Fran\u00e7oise, the dear Lord must be sorely vexed with us. The world is going too far in these days. As my poor Octave used to say, we have forgotten God too often, and He is taking vengeance upon us.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A bright flush animated my aunt's cheeks; it was Eulalie. As ill luck would have it, scarcely had she been admitted to the presence when Fran\u00e7oise reappeared and, with a smile which was meant to indicate her full participation in the pleasure which, she had no doubt, her tidings would give my aunt, articulating each syllable so as to shew that, in spite of her having to translate them into indirect speech, she was repeating, as a good servant should, the very words which the new visitor had condescended to use, said: \"His reverence the Cur\u00e9 would be delighted, enchanted, if Mme. Octave is not resting just now, and could see him. His reverence does not wish to disturb Mme. Octave. His reverence is downstairs; I told him to go into the parlour.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had the truth been known, the Cur\u00e9's visits gave my aunt no such ecstatic pleasure as Fran\u00e7oise supposed, and the air of jubilation with which she felt bound to illuminate her face whenever she had to announce his arrival, did not altogether correspond to what was felt by her invalid. The Cur\u00e9 (an excellent man, with whom I am sorry now that I did not converse more often, for, even if he cared nothing for the arts, he knew a great many etymologies), being in the habit of shewing distinguished visitors over his church (he had even planned to compile a history of the Parish of Com-bray), used to weary her with his endless explanations, which, incidentally, never varied in the least degree. But when his visit synchronized exactly with Eulalie's it became frankly distasteful to my aunt. She would have preferred to make the most of Eulalie, and not to have had the whole of her circle about her at one time. But she dared not send the Cur\u00e9 away, and had to content herself with making a sign to Eulalie not to leave when he did, so that she might have her to herself for a little after he had gone.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What is this I have been hearing, Father, that a painter has set up his easel in your church, and is copying one of the windows? Old as I am, I can safely say that I have never even heard of such a thing in all my life! What is the world coming to next, I wonder! And the ugliest thing in the whole church, too.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I will not go so far as to say that it is quite the ugliest, for, although there are certain things in Saint-Hilaire which are well worth a visit, there are others that are very old now, in my poor basilica, the only one in all the diocese that has never even been restored. The Lord knows, our porch is dirty and out of date; still, it is of a majestic character; take, for instance, the Esther tapestries, though personally I would not give a brass farthing for the pair of them, but experts put them next after the ones at Sens. I can quite see, too, that apart from certain details which are\u2014well, a trifle realistic, they shew features which testify to a genuine power of observation. But don't talk to me about the windows. Is it common sense, I ask you, to leave up windows which shut out all the daylight, and even confuse the eyes by throwing patches of colour, to which I should be hard put to it to give a name, on a floor in which there are not two slabs on the same level? And yet they refuse to renew the floor for me because, if you please, those are the tombstones of the Abbots of Combray and the Lords of Guermantes, the old Counts, you know, of Brabant, direct ancestors of the present Duc de Guermantes, and of his Duchesse also, since she was a lady of the Guermantes family, and married her cousin.\" (My grandmother, whose steady refusal to take any interest in 'persons' had ended in her confusing all their names and titles, whenever anyone mentioned the Duchesse de Guermantes used to make out that she must be related to Mme. de Villeparisis. The whole family would then burst out laughing; and she would attempt to justify herself by harking back to some invitation to a christening or funeral: \"I feel sure that there was a Guermantes in it somewhere.\" And for once I would side with the others, and against her, refusing to admit that there could be any connection between her school-friend and the descendant of Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Look at Roussainville,\" the Cur\u00e9 went on. \"It is nothing more nowadays than a parish of farmers, though in olden times the place must have had a considerable importance from its trade in felt hats and clocks. (I am not certain, by the way, of the etymology of Roussainville. I should dearly like to think that the name was originally Rouville, from Radulfi villa, analogous, don't you see, to Ch\u00e2teauroux,Castrum Radulfi, but we will talk about that some other time.) Very well; the church there has superb windows, almost all quite modern, including that most imposing 'Entry of Louis-Philippe into Combray' which would be more in keeping, surely, at Combray itself, and which is every bit as good, I understand, as the famous^windows at Chartres. Only yesterday I met Dr. Percepied's brother, who goes in for these things, and he told me that he looked upon it as a most beautiful piece of work. But, as I said to this artist, who, by the way, seems to be a most civil fellow, and is a regular virtuoso, it appears, with his brush; what on earth, I said to him, do you find so extraordinary in this window, which is, if anything, a little dingier than the rest?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am sure that if you were to ask his Lordship,\" said my aunt in a resigned tone, for she had begun to feel that she was going to be 'tired,' \"he would never refuse you a new window.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You may depend upon it, Mme. Octave,\" replied the Cur\u00e9. \"Why, it was just his Lordship himself who started the outcry about the window, by proving that it represented Gilbert the Bad, a Lord of Guermantes and a direct descendant of Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant, who was a daughter of the House of Guermantes, receiving absolution from Saint Hilaire.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I don't see where Saint Hilaire comes in.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why yes, have you never noticed, in the corner of the window, a lady in a yellow robe? Very well, that is Saint Hilaire, who is also known, you will remember, in certain parts of the country as Saint Illiers, Saint H\u00e8lier, and even, in the Jura, Saint Ylie. But these various corruptions of Sanctus Hilarius are by no means the most curious that have occurred in the names of the blessed Saints. Take, for example, my good Eulalie, the case of your own patron, Sancta Eulalia; do you know what she has become in Burgundy? Saint Eloi, nothing more nor less! The lady has become a gentleman. Do you hear that, Eulalie, after you are dead they will make a man of you!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Father will always have his joke.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Gilbert's brother, Charles the Stammerer, was a pious prince, but, having early in life lost his father, Pepin the Mad, who died as a result of his mental infirmity, he wielded the supreme power with all the arrogance of a man who has not been subjected to discipline in his youth, so much so that, whenever he saw a man in a town whose face he did not remember, he would massacre the whole place, to the last inhabitant. Gilbert, wishing to be avenged on Charles, caused the church at Combray to be burned down, the original church, that was, which Th\u00e9odebert, when he and his court left the country residence he had near here, at Thiberzy (which is, of course, Theodeberiacus), to go out and fight the Burgundians, had promised to build over the tomb of Saint Hilaire if the Saint brought him; victory. Nothing remains of it now but the crypt, into which Th\u00e9odore has probably taken you, for Gilbert burned all the rest. Finally, he defeated the unlucky Charles with the aid of William\" which the Cur\u00e9 pronounced \"Will'am\" \"the Conqueror, which is why so many English still come to visit the place. But he does not appear to have managed to win the affection of the people of Combray, for they fell upon him as he was coming out from mass, and cut off his head. Th\u00e9odore has a little book, that he lends people, which tells you the whole story.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But what is unquestionably the most remarkable thing about our church is the view from the belfry, which is full of grandeur. Certainly in your case, since you are not very strong, I should never recommend you: to climb our seven and ninety steps, just half the number they have in the famous cathedral at Milan. It is quite tiring enough for the most active person, especially as you have to go on your hands and knees, if you don't wish to crack your skull, and you collect all the cobwebs off the staircase upon your clothes. In any case you should be well wrapped up,\" he went on, without noticing my aunt's fury at the mere suggestion that she could ever, possibly, be capable of climbing into his belfry, \"for there's a strong breeze there, once you get to the top. Some people even assure me that they have felt the chill of death up there. No matter, on Sundays there are always clubs and societies, who come, some of them, long distances to admire our beautiful panorama, and they always go home charmed. Wait now, next Sunday, if the weather holds, you will be sure to find a lot of people there, for Rogation-tide. You must admit, certainly, that the view from up there is like a fairy-tale, with what you might call vistas along the plain, which have quite a special charm of their own. On a clear day you can see as far as Verneuil. And then another thing; you can see at the same time places which you are in the habit of seeing one without the other, as, for instance, the course of the Vivonne and the ditches at Saint-Assise-l\u00e8s-Combray, which are separated, really, by a screen of tall trees; or, to take another example, there are all the canals at Jouy-le-Vicomte, which is Gaudiacus vicecomitis, as of course you know. Each time that I have been to Jouy I have seen a bit of a canal in one place, and then I have turned a corner and seen another, but when I saw the second I could no longer see the first. I tried in vain to imagine how they lay by one another; it was no good. But, from the top of Saint-Hilaire, it's quite another matter; the whole countryside is spread out before you like a map. Only, you cannot make out the water; you would say that there were great rifts in the town, slicing it up so neatly that it looks like a loaf of bread which still holds together after it has been cut up. To get it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at once; up here on the top of Saint-Hilaire and down there at Jouy-le-Vicomte.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Cur\u00e9 had so much exhausted my aunt that no sooner had he gone than she was obliged to send away Eulalie also\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Here, my poor Eulalie,\" she said in a feeble voice, drawing a coin from a small purse which lay ready to her hand. \"This is just something so that you shall not forget me in your prayers.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but, Mme. Octave, I don't think I ought to; you know very well that I don't come here for that!\" So Eulalie would answer, with the same hesitation and the same embarrassment, every Sunday, as though each temptation were the first, and with a look of displeasure which enlivened my aunt and never offended her, for if it so happened that Eulalie, when she took the money, looked a little less sulky than usual, my aunt would remark afterwards, \"I cannot think what has come over Eulalie; I gave her just the trifle I always give, and she did not look at all pleased.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't think she has very much to complain of, all the same,\" Fran\u00e7oise would sigh grimly, for she had a tendency to regard as petty cash all that my aunt might give her for herself or her children, and as treasure riotously squandered on a pampered and ungrateful darling the little coins slipped, Sunday by Sunday, into Eulalie's hand, but so discreetly passed that Fran\u00e7oise never managed to see them. It was not that she wanted to have for herself the money my aunt bestowed on Eulalie. She already enjoyed a sufficiency of all that my aunt possessed, in the knowledge that the wealth of the mistress automatically ennobled and glorified the maid in the eyes of the world; and that she herself was conspicuous and worthy to be praised throughout Combray, Jouy-le-Vicomte, and other cities of men, on account of my aunt's many farms, her frequent and prolonged visits from the Cur\u00e9, and the astonishing number of bottles of Vichy water which she consumed. Fran\u00e7oise was avaricious only for my aunt; had she had control over my aunt's fortune (which would have more than satisfied her highest ambition) she would have guarded it from the assaults of strangers with a maternal ferocity. She would, however, have seen no great harm in what my aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to give away, had she given only to those who were already rich. Perhaps she felt that such persons, not being actually in need of my aunt's presents, could not be suspected of simulating affection for her on that account. Besides, presents offered to persons of great wealth and position, such as Mme. Sazerat, M. Swann, M. Legrandin and Mme. Goupil, to persons of the 'same class' as my aunt, and who would naturally 'mix with her,' seemed to Fran\u00e7oise to be included among the ornamental customs of that strange and brilliant life led by rich people, who hunted and shot, gave balls and paid visits, a life which she would contemplate with an admiring smile. But it was by no means the same thing if, for this princely exchange of courtesies, my aunt substituted mere charity, if her beneficiaries were of the class which Fran\u00e7oise would label \"people like myself,\" or \"people no better than myself,\" people whom she despised even more if they did not address her always as \"Mme. Fran\u00e7oise,\" just to shew that they considered themselves to be 'not as good.' And when she saw that, despite all her warnings, my aunt continued to do exactly as she pleased, and to fling money away with both hands (or so, at least, Fran\u00e7oise believed) on undeserving objects, she began to find that the presents she herself received from my aunt were very tiny compared to the imaginary riches squandered upon Eulalie, There was not, in the neighbourhood of Combray, a farm of such prosperity and importance that Fran\u00e7oise doubted Eulalie's ability to buy it, without thinking twice, out of the capital which her visits to my aunt had 'brought in.' It must be added that Eulalie had formed an exactly similar estimate of the vast and secret hoards of Fran\u00e7oise. So, every Sunday, after Eulalie had gone, Fran\u00e7oise would mercilessly prophesy her coming downfall. She hated Eulalie, but was at the same time afraid of her, and so felt bound, when Eulalie was there, to 'look pleasant.' But she would make up for that after the other's departure; never, it is true, alluding to her by name, but hinting at her in Sibylline oracles, or in utterances of a comprehensive character, like those of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher, but so worded that their special application could not escape my aunt. After peering out at the side of the curtain to see whether Eulalie had shut the front-door behind her; \"Flatterers know how to make themselves welcome, and to gather up the crumbs; but have patience, have patience; our God is a jealous God, and one fine day He will be avenged upon them!\" she would declaim, with the sidelong, insinuating glance of Joash, thinking of Athaliah alone when he says that the\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    prosperity\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of wicked men runs like a torrent past\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And soon is spent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But on this memorable afternoon, when the Cur\u00e9 had come as well, and by his interminable visit had drained my aunt's strength, Fran\u00e7oise followed Eulalie from the room, saying: \"Mme. Octave, I will leave you to rest; you look utterly tired out.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And my aunt answered her not a word, breathing a sigh so faint that it seemed it must prove her last, and lying there with closed eyes, as though already dead. But hardly had Fran\u00e7oise arrived downstairs, when four peals of a bell, pulled with the utmost violence, reverberated through the house, and my aunt, sitting erect upon her bed, called out: \"Has Eulalie gone yet? Would you believe it; I forgot to ask her whether Mme. Goupil arrived in church before the Elevation. Run after her, quick!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Fran\u00e7oise returned alone, having failed to overtake Eulalie. \"It is most provoking,\" said my aunt, shaking her head. \"The one important thing that I had to ask her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this way life went by for my aunt L\u00e9onie, always the same, in the gentle uniformity of what she called, with a pretence of deprecation but with a deep tenderness, her 'little jog-trot.' Respected by all and sundry, not merely in her own house, where every one of us, having learned the futility of recommending any healthier mode of life, had become gradually resigned to its observance, but in the village as well, where, three streets away, a tradesman who had to hammer nails into a packing-case would send first to Fran\u00e7oise to make sure that my aunt was not 'resting'\u2014her 'little jog-trot' was, none the less, brutally disturbed on one occasion in this same year. Like a fruit hidden among its leaves, which has grown and ripened unobserved by man, until it falls of its own accord, there came upon us one night the kitchen-maid's confinement. Her pains were unbearable, and, as there was no midwife in Combray, Fran\u00e7oise had to set off before dawn to fetch one from Thiberzy. My aunt was unable to 'rest,' owing to the cries of the girl, and as Fran\u00e7oise, though the distance was nothing, was very late in returning, her services were greatly missed. And so, in the course of the morning, my mother said to me: \"Run upstairs, and see if your aunt wants anything.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went into the first of her two rooms, and through the open door of the other saw my aunt lying on her side, asleep. I could hear her breathing, in what was almost distinguishable as a snore. I was just going to slip away when something, probably the sound of my entry, interrupted her sleep, and made it 'change speed,' as they say of motorcars nowadays, for the music of her snore broke off for a second and began again on a lower note; then she awoke, and half turned her face, which I could see for the first time; a kind of horror was imprinted on it; plainly she had just escaped from some terrifying dream. She could not see me from where she was lying, and I stood there not knowing whether I ought to go forward or to retire; but all at once she seemed to return to a sense of reality, and to grasp the falsehood of the visions that had terrified her; a smile of joy, a pious act of thanksgiving to God, Who is pleased to grant that life shall be less cruel than our dreams, feebly illumined her face, and, with the habit she had formed of speaking to herself, half-aloud, when she thought herself alone, she murmured: \"The Lord be praised! We have nothing to disturb us here but the kitchen-maid's baby. And I've been dreaming that my poor Octave had come back to life, and was trying to make me take a walk every day!\" She stretched out a hand towards her rosary, which was lying on the small table, but sleep was once again getting the mastery, and did not leave her the strength to reach it; she fell asleep, calm and contented, and I crept out of the room on tiptoe, without either her or anyone's else ever knowing, from that day to this, what I had seen and heard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I say that, apart from such rare happenings as this confinement, my aunt's 'little jog-trot' never underwent any variation, I do not include those variations which, repeated at regular intervals and in identical form, did no more, really, than print a sort of uniform pattern upon the greater uniformity of her life. So, for instance, every Saturday, as Fran\u00e7oise had to go in the afternoon to market at Roussainville-le-Pin, the whole household would have to have luncheon an hour earlier. And my aunt had so thoroughly acquired the habit of this weekly exception to her general habits, that she clung to it as much as to the rest. She was so well 'routined' to it, as Fran\u00e7oise would say, that if, on a Saturday, she had had to wait for her luncheon until the regular hour, it would have 'upset' her as much as if she had had, on an ordinary day, to put her luncheon forward to its Saturday time. Incidentally this acceleration of luncheon gave Saturday, for all of us, an individual character, kindly and rather attractive. At the moment when, ordinarily, there was still an hour to be lived through before meal-time sounded, we would all know that in a few seconds we should see the endives make their precocious appearance, followed by the special favour of an omelette, an unmerited steak. The return of this asymmetrical Saturday was one of those petty occurrences, intra-mural, localised, almost civic, which, in uneventful lives and stable orders of society, create a kind of national unity, and become the favourite theme for conversation, for pleasantries, for anecdotes which can be embroidered as the narrator pleases; it would have provided a nucleus, ready-made, for a legendary cycle, if any of us had had the epic mind. At daybreak, before we were dressed, without rhyme or reason, save for the pleasure of proving the strength of our solidarity, we would call to one another good-humoredly, cordially, patriotically, \"Hurry up; there's no time to be lost; don't forget, it's Saturday!\" while my aunt, gossiping with Fran\u00e7oise, and reflecting that the day would be even longer than usual, would say, \"You might cook them a nice bit of veal, seeing that it's Saturday.\" If, at half-past ten, some one absent-mindedly pulled out a watch and said, \"I say, an hour-and-a-half still before luncheon,\" everyone else would be in ecstasies over being able to retort at once: \"Why, what are you thinking about? Have you for-gotten that it's Saturday?\" And a quarter of an hour later we would still be laughing, and reminding ourselves to go up and tell aunt L\u00e9onie about this absurd mistake, to amuse her. The very face of the sky appeared to undergo a change. After luncheon the sun, conscious that it was Saturday, would blaze an hour longer in the zenith, and when some one, thinking that we were late in starting for our walk, said, \"What, only two o'clock!\" feeling the heavy throb go by him of the twin strokes from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire (which as a rule passed no one at that hour upon the highways, deserted for the midday meal or for the nap which follows it, or on the banks of the bright and ever-flowing stream, which even the angler had abandoned, and so slipped unaccompanied into the vacant sky, where only a few loitering clouds remained to greet them) the whole family would respond in chorus: \"Why, you're forgetting; we had luncheon an hour earlier; you know very well it's Saturday.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The surprise of a 'barbarian' (for so we termed everyone who was not acquainted with Saturday's special customs) who had called at eleven o'clock to speak to my father, and had found us at table, was an event which used to cause Fran\u00e7oise as much merriment as, perhaps, anything that had ever happened in her life. And if she found it amusing that the nonplussed visitor should not have known, beforehand, that we had our luncheon an hour earlier on Saturday, it was still more irresistibly funny that my father himself (fully as she sympathised, from the bottom of her heart, with the rigid chauvinism which prompted him) should never have dreamed that the barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a matter, and so had replied, with no further enlightenment of the other's surprise at seeing us already in the dining-room: \"You see, it's Saturday.\" On reaching this point in the story, Fran\u00e7oise would pause to wipe the tears of merriment from her eyes, and then, to add to her own enjoyment, would prolong the dialogue, inventing a further reply for the visitor to whom the word 'Saturday' had conveyed nothing. And so far from our objecting to these interpolations, we would feel that the story was not yet long enough, and would rally her with: \"Oh, but surely he said something else as well. There was more than that, the first time you told it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My great-aunt herself would lay aside her work, and raise her head and look on at us over her glasses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The day had yet another characteristic feature, namely, that during May we used to go out on Saturday evenings after dinner to the 'Month of Mary' devotions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we were liable, there, to meet M. Vinteuil, who held very strict views on \"the deplorable untidiness of young people, which seems to be encouraged in these days,\" my mother would first see that there was nothing out of order in my appearance, and then we would set out for the church. It was in these 'Month of Mary' services that I can remember having first fallen in love with hawthorn-blossom. The hawthorn was not merely in the church, for there, holy ground as it was, we had all of us a right of entry; but, arranged upon the altar itself, inseparable from the mysteries in whose celebration it was playing a part, it thrust in among the tapers and the sacred vessels its rows of branches, tied to one another horizontally in a stiff, festal scheme of decoration; and they were made more lovely still by the scalloped outline of the dark leaves, over which were scattered in profusion, as over a bridal train, little clusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness. Though I dared not look at them save through my fingers, I could feel that the formal scheme was composed of living things, and that it was Nature herself who, by trimming the shape of the foliage, and by adding the crowning ornament of those snowy buds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a public rejoicing and a solemn mystery. Higher up on the altar, a flower had opened here and there with a careless grace, holding so unconcernedly, like a final, almost vaporous bedizening, its bunch of stamens, slender as gossamer, which clouded the flower itself in a white mist, that in following these with my eyes, in trying to imitate, somewhere inside myself, the action of their blossoming, I imagined it as a swift and thoughtless movement of the head with an enticing glance from her contracted pupils, by a young girl in white, careless and alive\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Vinteuil had come in with his daughter and had sat down beside us. He belonged to a good family, and had once been music-master to my grandmother's sisters; so that when, after losing his wife and inheriting some property, he had retired to the neighbourhood of Combray, we used often to invite him to our house. But with his intense prudishness he had given up coming, so as not to be obliged to meet Swann, who had made what he called \"a most unsuitable marriage, as seems to be the fashion in these days.\" My mother, on hearing that he 'composed,' told him by way of a compliment that, when she came to see him, he must play her something of his own. M. Vinteuil would have liked nothing better, but he carried politeness and consideration for others to so fine a point, always putting himself in their place, that he was afraid of boring them, or of appearing egotistical, if he carried out, or even allowed them to suspect what were his own desires. On the day when my parents had gone to pay him a visit, I had accompanied them, but they had allowed me to remain outside, and as M. Vinteuil's house, Montjouvain, stood on a site actually hollowed out from a steep hill covered with shrubs, among which I took cover, I had found myself on a level with his drawing-room, upstairs, and only a few feet away from its window. When a servant came in to tell him that my parents had arrived, I had seen M. Vinteuil run to the piano and lay out a sheet of music so as to catch the eye. But as soon as they entered the room he had snatched it away and hidden it in a corner. He was afraid, no doubt, of letting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave him a chance of playing them some of his compositions. And every time that my mother, in the course of her visit, had returned to the subject of his playing, he had hurriedly protested: \"I cannot think who put that on the piano; it is not the proper place for it at all,\" and had turned the conversation aside to other topics, simply because those were of less interest to himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His one and only passion was for his daughter, and she, with her somewhat boyish appearance, looked so robust that it was hard to restrain a smile when one saw the precautions her father used to take for her health, with spare shawls always in readiness to wrap around her shoulders. My grandmother had drawn our attention to the gentle, delicate, almost timid expression which might often be caught flitting across the face, dusted all over with freckles, of this otherwise stolid child. When she had spoken, she would at once take her own words in the sense in which her audience must have heard them, she would be alarmed at the possibility of a misunderstanding, and one would see, in clear outline, as though in a transparency, beneath the mannish face of the 'good sort' that she was, the finer features of a young woman in tears\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, before turning to leave the church, I made a genuflection before the altar, I felt suddenly, as I rose again, a bitter-sweet fragrance of almonds steal towards me from the hawthorn-blossom, and I then noticed that on the flowers themselves were little spots of a creamier colour, in which I imagined that this fragrance must lie concealed, as the taste of an almond cake lay in the burned parts, or the sweetness of Mile. Vinteuil's cheeks beneath their freckles. Despite the heavy, motionless silence of the hawthorns, these gusts of fragrance came to me like the murmuring of an intense vitality, with which the whole altar was quivering like a roadside hedge explored by living antennae, of which I was reminded by seeing some stamens, almost red in colour, which seemed to have kept the springtime virulence, the irritant power of stinging insects now transmuted into flowers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Outside the church we would stand talking for a moment with M. Vinteuil, in the porch. Boys would be chevying one another in the Square, and he would interfere, taking the side of the little ones and lecturing the big. If his daughter said, in her thick, comfortable voice, how glad she had been to see us, immediately it would seem as though some elder and more sensitive sister, latent in her, had blushed at this thoughtless, schoolboyish utterance, which had, perhaps, made us think that she was angling for an invitation to the house. Her father would then arrange a cloak over her shoulders, they would clamber into a little dog-cart which she herself drove, and home they would both go to Montjouvain. As for ourselves, the next day being Sunday, with no need to be up and stirring before high mass, if it was a moonlight night and warm, then, instead of taking us home at once, my father, in his thirst for personal distinction, would lead us on a long walk round by the Calvary, which my mother's utter incapacity for taking her bearings, or even for knowing which road she might be on, made her regard as a triumph of his strategic genius. Sometimes we would go as far as the viaduct, which began to stride on its long legs of stone at the railway station, and to me typified all the wretchedness of exile beyond the last outposts of civilisation, because every year, as we came down from Paris, we would be warned to take special care, when we got to Combray, not to miss the station, to be ready before the train stopped, since it would start again in two minutes and proceed across the viaduct, out of the lands of Christendom, of which Combray, to me, represented the farthest limit. We would return by the Boulevard de la Gare, which contained the most attractive villas in the town. In each of their gardens the moonlight, copying the art of Hubert Robert, had scattered its broken staircases of white marble, its fountains of water and gates temptingly ajar. Its beams had swept away the telegraph office. All that was left of it was a column, half shattered, but preserving the beauty of a ruin which endures for all time. I would by now be dragging my weary limbs, and ready to drop with sleep; the balmy scent of the lime-trees seemed a consolation which I could obtain only at the price of great suffering and exhaustion, and not worthy of the effort. From gates far apart the watchdogs, awakened by our steps in the silence, would set up an antiphonal barking, as I still hear them bark, at times, in the evenings, and it is in their custody (when the public gardens of Combray were constructed on its site) that the Boulevard de la Gare must have taken refuge, for wherever I may be, as soon as they begin their alternate challenge and acceptance, I can see it again with all its lime-trees, and its pavement glistening beneath the moon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly my father would bring us to a standstill and ask my mother\u2014\"Where are we?\" Utterly worn out by the walk but still proud of her husband, she would lovingly confess that she had not the least idea. He would shrug his shoulders and laugh. And then, as though it had slipped, with his latchkey, from his waistcoat pocket, he would point out to us, when it stood before our eyes, the back-gate of our own garden, which had come hand-in-hand with the familiar corner of the Rue du Saint-Esprit, to await us, to greet us at the end of our wanderings over paths unknown. My mother would murmur admiringly \"You really are wonderful!\" And from that instant I had not to take another step; the ground moved forward under my feet in that garden where, for so long, my actions had ceased to require any control, or even attention, from my will. Custom came to take me in her arms, carried me all the way up to my bed, and laid me down there like a little child\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although Saturday, by beginning an hour earlier, and by depriving her of the services of Fran\u00e7oise, passed more slowly than other days for my aunt, yet, the moment it was past, and a new week begun, she would look forward with impatience to its return, as something that embodied all the novelty and distraction which her frail and disordered body was still able to endure. This was not to say, however, that she did not long, at times, for some even greater variation, that she did not pass through those abnormal hours in which one thirsts for something different from what one has, when those people who, through lack of energy or imagination, are unable to generate any motive power in themselves, cry out, as the clock strikes or the postman knocks, in their eagerness for news (even if it be bad news), for some emotion (even that of grief); when the heartstrings, which prosperity has silenced, like a harp laid by, yearn to be plucked and sounded again by some hand, even a brutal hand, even if it shall break them; when the will, which has with such difficulty brought itself to subdue its impulse, to renounce its right to abandon itself to its own uncontrolled desires, and consequent sufferings, would fain cast its guiding reins into the hands of circumstances, coercive and, it may be, cruel. Of course, since my aunt's strength, which was completely drained by the slightest exertion, returned but drop by drop into the pool of her repose, the reservoir was very slow in filling, and months would go by before she reached that surplus which other people use up in their daily activities, but which she had no idea\u2014and could never decide how to employ. And I have no doubt that then\u2014just as a desire to have her potatoes served with b\u00e9chamel sauce, for a change, would be formed, ultimately, from the pleasure she found in the daily reappearance of those mashed potatoes of which she was never 'tired'\u2014she would extract from the accumulation of those monotonous days (on which she so much depended) a keen expectation of some domestic cataclysm, instantaneous in its happening, but violent enough to compel her to put into effect, once for all, one of those changes which she knew would be beneficial to her health, but to which she could never make up her mind without some such stimulus. She was genuinely fond of us; she would have enjoyed the long luxury of weeping for our untimely decease; coming at a moment when she felt 'well' and was not in a perspiration, the news that the house was being destroyed by a fire, in which all the rest of us had already perished, a fire which, in a little while, would not leave one stone standing upon another, but from which she herself would still have plenty of time to escape without undue haste, provided that she rose at once from her bed, must often have haunted her dreams, as a prospect which combined with the two minor advantages of letting her taste the full savour of her affection for us in long years of mourning, and of causing universal stupefaction in the village when she should sally forth to conduct our obsequies, crushed but courageous, moribund but erect, the paramount and priceless boon of forcing her at the right moment, with no time to be lost, no room for weakening hesitations, to go off and spend the summer at her charming farm of Mirougrain, where there was a waterfall. Inasmuch as nothing of this sort had ever occurred, though indeed she must often have pondered the success of such a manoeuvre as she lay alone absorbed in her interminable games of patience (and though it must have plunged her in despair from the first moment of its realisation, from the first of those little unforeseen facts, the first word of calamitous news, whose accents can never afterwards be expunged from the memory, everything that bears upon it the imprint of actual, physical death, so terribly different from the logical abstraction of its possibility) she would fall back from time to time, to add an interest to her life, upon imagining other, minor catastrophes, which she would follow up with passion. She would beguile herself with a sudden suspicion that Fran\u00e7oise had been robbing her, that she had set a trap to make certain, and had caught her betrayer red-handed; and being in the habit, when she made up a game of cards by herself, of playing her own and her adversary's hands at once, she would first stammer out Fran\u00e7oise's awkward apologies, and then reply to them with such a fiery indignation that any of us who happened to intrude upon her at one of these moments would find her bathed in perspiration, her eyes blazing, her false hair pushed awry and exposing the baldness of her brows. Fran\u00e7oise must often, from the next room, have heard these mordant sarcasms levelled at herself, the mere framing of which in words would not have relieved my aunt's feelings sufficiently, had they been allowed to remain in a purely immaterial form, without the degree of substance and reality which she added to them by murmuring them half-aloud. Sometimes, however, even these counterpane dramas would not satisfy my aunt; she must see her work staged. And so, on a Sunday, with all the doors mysteriously closed, she would confide in Eulalie her doubts of Fran\u00e7oise's integrity and her determination to be rid of her, and on another day she would confide in Fran\u00e7oise her suspicions of the disloyalty of Eulalie, to whom the front-door would very soon be closed for good. A few days more, and, disgusted with her latest confidant, she would again be 'as thick as thieves' with the traitor, while, before the next performance, the two would once more have changed their parts. But the suspicions which Eulalie might occasionally breed in her were no more than a fire of straw, which must soon subside for lack of fuel, since Eulalie was not living with her in the house. It was a very different matter when the suspect was Fran\u00e7oise, of whose presence under the same roof as herself my aunt was perpetually conscious, while for fear of catching cold, were she to leave her bed, she would never dare go downstairs to the kitchen to see for herself whether there was, indeed, any foundation for her suspicions. And so on by degrees, until her mind had no other occupation than to attempt, at every hour of the day, to discover what was being done, what was being concealed from her by Fran\u00e7oise. She would detect the most furtive movement of Fran\u00e7oise's features, something contradictory in what she was saying, some desire which she appeared to be screening. And she would shew her that she was unmasked, by, a single word, which made Fran\u00e7oise turn pale, and which my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in driving into her unhappy servant's heart. And the very next Sunday a disclosure by Eulalie\u2014like one of those discoveries which suddenly open up an unsuspected field for exploration to some new science which has hitherto followed only the beaten paths\u2014proved to my aunt that her own worst suspicions fell a long way short of the appalling truth. \"But Fran\u00e7oise ought to know that,\" said Eulalie, \"now that you have given her a carriage.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now that I have given her a carriage!\" gasped my aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but I didn't know; I only thought so; I saw her go by yesterday in her open coach, as proud as Artaban, on her way to Roussainville market. I supposed that it must be Mme. Octave who had given it to her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So on by degrees, until Fran\u00e7oise and my aunt, the quarry and the hunter, could never cease from trying to forestall each other's devices. My mother was afraid lest Fran\u00e7oise should develop a genuine hatred of my aunt, who was doing everything in her power to annoy her. However that might be, Fran\u00e7oise had come, more and more, to pay an infinitely scrupulous attention to my aunt's least word and gesture. When she had to ask her for anything she would hesitate, first, for a long time, making up her mind how best to begin. And when she had uttered her request, she would watch my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the expression on her face what she thought of it, and how she would reply. And in this way\u2014whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the seventeenth century, and wished to bring himself nearer to the great Louis, would consider that he was making progress in that direction when he constructed a pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic family, or when he engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning Sovereigns of Europe, and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was making in seeking to establish a similarity by an exact and therefore lifeless copy of mere outward forms\u2014a middle-aged lady in a small country town, by doing no more than yield whole-hearted obedience to her own irresistible eccentricities, and to a spirit of mischief engendered by the utter idleness of her existence, could see, without ever having given a thought to Louis XIV, the most trivial occupations of her daily life, her morning toilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap, assume, by virtue of their despotic singularity, something of the interest that was to be found in what Saint-Simon used to call the 'machinery' of life at Versailles; and was able, too, to persuade herself that her silence, a shade of good humour or of arrogance on her features, would provide Fran\u00e7oise with matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and terror, as did the silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the King when a courtier, or even his greatest nobles, had presented a petition to him, at the turning of an avenue, at Versailles\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One Sunday, when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the Cur\u00e9 and from Eulalie, and had been left alone, afterwards, to rest, the whole family went upstairs to bid her good night, and Mamma ventured to condole with her on the unlucky coincidence that always brought both visitors to her door at the same time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I hear that things went wrong again to-day, L\u00e9onie,\" she said kindly, \"you have had all your friends here at once.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And my great-aunt interrupted with: \"Too many good things...\" for, since her daughter's illness, she felt herself in duty bound to revive her as far as possible by always drawing her attention to the brighter side of things. But my father had begun to speak\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I should like to take advantage,\" he said, \"of the whole family's being here together, to tell you a story, so as not to have to begin all over again to each of you separately. I am afraid we are in M. Legrandin's bad books; he would hardly say 'How d'ye do' to me this morning.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not wait to hear the end of my father's story, for I had been with him myself after mass when we had passed M. Legrandin; instead, I went downstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner, which was of fresh interest to me daily, like the news in a paper, and excited me as might the programme of a coming festivity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As M. Legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church, walking by the side of a lady, the owner of a country house in the neighbourhood, whom we knew only by sight, my father had saluted him in a manner at once friendly and reserved, without stopping in his walk; M. Legrandin had barely acknowledged the courtesy, and then with an air of surprise, as though he had not recognised us, and with that distant look characteristic of people who do not wish to be agreeable, and who from the suddenly receding depths of their eyes seem to have caught sight of you at the far end of an interminably straight road, and at so great a distance that they content themselves with directing towards you an almost imperceptible movement of the head, in proportion to your doll-like dimensions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, the lady who was walking with Legrandin was a model of virtue, known and highly respected; there could be no question of his being out for amorous adventure, and annoyed at being detected; and my father asked himself how he could possibly have displeased our friend\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us,\" he said, \"because among all those people in their Sunday clothes there is something about him, with his little cut-away coat and his soft neckties, so little 'dressed-up,' so genuinely simple; an air of innocence, almost, which is really attractive.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the vote of the family council was unanimous, that my father had imagined the whole thing, or that Legrandin, at the moment in question, had been preoccupied in thinking about something else. Anyhow, my father's fears were dissipated no later than the following evening. As we returned from a long walk we saw, near the Pont-Vieux, Legrandin himself, who, on account of the holidays, was spending a few days more in Combray. He came up to us with outstretched hand: \"Do you know, master book-lover,\" he asked me, \"this line of Paul Desjardins?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is not that a fine rendering of a moment like this? Perhaps you have never read Paul Desjardins. Read him, my boy, read him; in these days he is converted, they tell me, into a preaching friar, but he used to have the most charming water-colour touch\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0May you always see a blue sky overhead, my young friend; and then, even when the time comes, which is coming now for me, when the woods are all black, when night is fast falling, you will be able to console yourself, as I am doing, by looking up to the sky.\" He took a cigarette from his pocket and stood for a long time, his eyes fixed on the horizon. \"Goodbye, friends!\" he suddenly exclaimed, and left us.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the hour when I usually went downstairs to find out what there was for dinner, its preparation would already have begun, and Fran\u00e7oise, a colonel with all the forces of nature for her subalterns, as in the fairy-tales where giants hire themselves out as scullions, would be stirring the coals, putting the potatoes to steam, and, at the right moment, finishing over the fire those culinary masterpieces which had been first got ready in some of the great array of vessels, triumphs of the potter's craft, which ranged from tubs and boilers and cauldrons and fish kettles down to jars for game, moulds for pastry, and tiny pannikins for cream, and included an entire collection of pots and pans of every shape and size. I would stop by the table, where the kitchen-maid had shelled them, to inspect the platoons of peas, drawn up in ranks and numbered, like little green marbles, ready for a game; but what fascinated me would be the asparagus, tinged with ultramarine and rosy pink which ran from their heads, finely stippled in mauve and azure, through a series of imperceptible changes to their white feet, still stained a little by the soil of their garden-bed: a rainbow-loveliness that was not of this world. I felt that these celestial hues indicated the presence of exquisite creatures who had been pleased to assume vegetable form, who, through the disguise which covered their firm and edible flesh, allowed me to discern in this radiance of earliest dawn, these hinted rainbows, these blue evening shades, that precious quality which I should recognise again when, all night long after a dinner at which I had partaken of them, they played (lyrical and coarse in their jesting as the fairies in Shakespeare's Dream) at transforming my humble chamber into a bower of aromatic perfume.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Poor Giotto's Charity, as Swann had named her, charged by Fran\u00e7oise with the task of preparing them for the table, would have them lying beside her in a basket; sitting with a mournful air, as though all the sorrows of the world were heaped upon her; and the light crowns of azure which capped the asparagus shoots above their pink jackets would be finely and separately outlined, star by star, as in Giotto's fresco are the flowers banded about the brows, or patterning the basket of his Virtue at Padua. And, meanwhile, Fran\u00e7oise would be turning on the spit one of those chickens, such as she alone knew how to roast, chickens which had wafted far abroad from Combray the sweet savour of her merits, and which, while she was serving them to us at table, would make the quality of kindness predominate for the moment in my private conception of her character; the aroma of that cooked flesh, which she knew how to make so unctuous and so tender, seeming to me no more than the proper perfume of one of her many virtues.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the day on which, while my father took counsel with his family upon our strange meeting with Legrandin, I went down to the kitchen, was one of those days when Giotto's Charity, still very weak and ill after her recent confinement, had been unable to rise from her bed; Fran\u00e7oise, being without assistance, had fallen into arrears. When I went in, I saw her in the back-kitchen which opened on to the courtyard, in process of killing a chicken; by its desperate and quite natural resistance, which Fran\u00e7oise, beside herself with rage as she attempted to slit its throat beneath the ear, accompanied with shrill cries of \"Filthy creature! Filthy creature!\" it made the saintly kindness and unction of our servant rather less prominent than it would do, next day at dinner, when it made its appearance in a skin gold-embroidered like a chasuble, and its precious juice was poured out drop by drop as from a pyx. When it was dead Fran\u00e7oise mopped up its streaming blood, in which, however, she did not let her rancour drown, for she gave vent to another burst of rage, and, gazing down at the carcass of her enemy, uttered a final \"Filthy creature!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I crept out of the kitchen and upstairs, trembling all over; I could have prayed, then, for the instant dismissal of Fran\u00e7oise. But who would have baked me such hot rolls, boiled me such fragrant coffee, and even\u2014roasted me such chickens? And, as it happened, everyone else had already had to make the same cowardly reckoning. For my aunt L\u00e9onie knew (though I was still in ignorance of this) that Fran\u00e7oise, who, for her own daughter or for her nephews, would have given her life without a murmur, shewed a singular implacability in her dealings with the rest of the world. In spite of which my aunt still retained her, for, while conscious of her cruelty, she could appreciate her services. I began gradually to realise that Fran\u00e7oise's kindness, her compunction, the sum total of her virtues concealed many of these back-kitchen tragedies, just as history reveals to us that the reigns of the kings and queens who are portrayed as kneeling with clasped hands in the windows of churches, were stained by oppression and bloodshed. I had taken note of the fact that, apart from her own kinsfolk, the sufferings of humanity inspired in her a pity which increased in direct ratio to the distance separating the sufferers from herself. The tears which flowed from her in torrents when she read of the misfortunes of persons unknown to her, in a newspaper, were quickly stemmed once she had been able to form a more accurate mental picture of the victims. One night, shortly after her confinement, the kitchen-maid was seized with the most appalling pains; Mamma heard her groans, and rose and awakened Fran\u00e7oise, who, quite unmoved, declared that all the outcry was mere malingering, that the girl wanted to 'play the mistress' in the house. The doctor, who had been afraid of some such attack, had left a marker in a medical dictionary which we had, at the page on which the symptoms were described, and had told us to turn up this passage, where we would find the measures of 'first aid' to be adopted. My mother sent Fran\u00e7oise to fetch the book, warning her not to let the marker drop out. An hour elapsed, and Fran\u00e7oise had not returned; my mother, supposing that she had gone back to bed, grew vexed, and told me to go myself to the bookcase and fetch the volume. I did so, and there found Fran\u00e7oise who, in her curiosity to know what the marker indicated, had begun to read the clinical account of these after-pains, and was violently sobbing, now that it was a question of a type of illness with which she was not familiar. At each painful symptom mentioned by the writer she would exclaim: \"Oh, oh, Holy Virgin, is it possible that God wishes any wretched human creature to suffer so? Oh, the poor girl!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But when I had called her, and she had returned to the bedside of Giotto's Charity, her tears at once ceased to flow; she could find no stimulus for that pleasant sensation of tenderness and pity which she very well knew, having been moved to it often enough by the perusal of newspapers; nor any other pleasure of the same kind in her sense of weariness and irritation at being pulled out of bed in the middle of the night for the kitchen-maid; so that at the sight of those very sufferings, the printed account of which had moved her to tears, she had nothing to offer but ill-tempered mutterings, mingled with bitter sarcasm, saying, when she thought that we had gone out of earshot: \"Well, she need never have done what she must have done to bring all this about! She found that pleasant enough, I dare say! She had better not put on any airs now. All the same, he must have been a god-forsaken young man to go after that. Dear, dear, it's just as they used to say in my poor mother's country:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Snaps and snails and puppy-dogs' tails\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And dirty sluts in plenty\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Smell sweeter than roses in young men's noses\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 When the heart is one-and-twenty.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although, when her grandson had a slight cold in his head, she would Bet off at night, even if she were ill also, instead of going to bed, to see whether he had everything that he wanted, covering ten miles on foot before daybreak so as to be in time to begin her work, this same love for her own people, and her desire to establish the future greatness of her house on a solid foundation reacted, in her policy with regard to the other servants, in one unvarying maxim, which was never to let any of them set foot in my aunt's room; indeed she shewed a sort of pride in not allowing anyone else to come near my aunt, preferring, when she herself was ill, to get out of bed and to administer the Vichy water in person, rather than to concede to the kitchen-maid the right of entry into her mistress's presence. There is a species of hymenoptera, observed by Fabre, the burrowing wasp, which in order to provide a supply of fresh meat for her offspring after her own decease, calls in the science of anatomy to amplify the resources of her instinctive cruelty, and, having made a collection of weevils and spiders, proceeds with marvellous knowledge and skill to pierce the nerve-centre on which their power of locomotion (but none of their other vital functions) depends, so that the paralysed insect, beside which her egg is laid, will furnish the larva, when it is hatched, with a tamed and inoffensive quarry, incapable either of flight or of resistance, but perfectly fresh for the larder: in the same way Fran\u00e7oise had adopted, to minister to her permanent and unfaltering resolution to render the house uninhabitable to any other servant, a series of crafty and pitiless stratagems. Many years later we discovered that, if we had been fed on asparagus day after day throughout that whole season, it was because the smell of the plants gave the poor kitchen-maid, who had to prepare them, such violent attacks of asthma that she was finally obliged to leave my aunt's service.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas! we had definitely to alter our opinion of M. Legrandin. On one-of the Sundays following our meeting with him on the Pont-Vieux, after which my father had been forced to confess himself mistaken, as mass drew to an end, and, with the sunshine and the noise of the outer world, something else invaded the church, an atmosphere so far from sacred that Mme. Goupil, Mme. Percepied (all those, in fact, who a moment ago, when I arrived a little late, had been sitting motionless, their eyes fixed on their prayer-books; who, I might even have thought, had not seen me come in, had not their feet moved slightly to push away the little kneeling-desk which was preventing me from getting to my chair) began in loud voices to discuss with us all manner of utterly mundane topics, as though we were already outside in the Square, we saw, standing on the sun-baked steps of the porch, dominating the many-coloured tumult of the market, Legrandin himself, whom the husband of the lady we had seen with him, on the previous occasion, was just going to introduce to the wife of another large landed proprietor of the district. Legrandin's face shewed an extraordinary zeal and animation; he made a profound bow, with a subsidiary backward movement which brought his spine sharply up into a position behind its starting-point, a gesture in which he must have been trained by the husband of his sister, Mme. de Cambremer. This rapid recovery caused a sort of tense muscular wave to ripple over Legrandin's hips, which I had not supposed to be so fleshy; I cannot say why, but this undulation of pure matter, this wholly carnal fluency, with not the least hint in it of spiritual significance, this wave lashed to a fury by the wind of an assiduity, an obsequiousness of the basest sort, awoke my mind suddenly to the possibility of a Legrandin altogether different from the one whom we knew. The lady gave him some message for her coachman, and while he was stepping down to her carriage the impression of joy, timid and devout, which the introduction had stamped there, still lingered on his face. Carried away in a sort of dream, he smiled, then he began to hurry back towards the lady; he was walking faster than usual, and his shoulders swayed backwards and forwards, right and left, in the most absurd fashion; altogether he looked, so utterly had he abandoned himself to it, ignoring all other considerations, as though he were the lifeless and wire-pulled puppet of his own happiness. Meanwhile we were coming out through the porch; we were passing close beside him; he was too well bred to turn his head away; but he fixed his eyes, which had suddenly changed to those of a seer, lost in the profundity of his vision, on so distant a point of the horizon that he could not see us, and so had not to acknowledge our presence. His face emerged, still with an air of innocence, from his straight and pliant coat, which looked as though conscious of having been led astray, in spite of itself, and plunged into surroundings of a detested splendour. And a spotted necktie, stirred by the breezes of the Square, continued to float in front of Legrandin, like the standard of his proud isolation, of his noble independence. Just as we reached the house my mother discovered that we had forgotten the 'Saint-Honor\u00e9,' and asked my father to go back with me and tell them to send it up at once. Near the church we met Legrandin, coming towards us with the same lady, whom he was escorting to her carriage. He brushed past us, and did not interrupt what he was saying to her, but gave us, out of the corner of his blue eye, a little sign, which began and ended, so to speak, inside his eyelids, and as it did not involve the least movement of his facial muscles, managed to pass quite unperceived by the lady; but, striving to compensate by the intensity of his feelings for the somewhat restricted field in which they had to find expression, he made that blue chink, which was set apart for us, sparkle with all the animation of cordiality, which went far beyond mere playfulness, and almost touched the border-line of roguery; he subtilised the refinements of good-fellowship into a wink of connivance, a hint, a hidden meaning, a secret understanding, all the mysteries of complicity in a plot, and finally exalted his assurances of friendship to the level of protestations of affection, even of a declaration of love, lighting up for us, and for us alone, with a secret and languid flame invisible by the great lady upon his other side, an enamoured pupil in a countenance of ice.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only the day before he had asked my parents to send me to dine with him on this same Sunday evening. \"Come and bear your aged friend company,\" he had said to me. \"Like the nosegay which a traveller sends us from some land to which we shall never go again, come and let me breathe from the far country of your adolescence the scent of those flowers of spring among which I also used to wander, many years ago. Come with the primrose, with the canon's beard, with the gold-cup; come with the stone-crop, whereof are posies made, pledges of love, in the Balzacian flora, come with that flower of the Resurrection morning, the Easter daisy, come with the snowballs of the guelder-rose, which begin to embalm with their fragrance the alleys of your great-aunt's garden ere the last snows of Lent are melted from its soil. Come with the glorious silken raiment of the lily, apparel fit for Solomon, and with the many-coloured enamel of the pansies, but come, above all, with the spring breeze, still cooled by the last frosts of winter, wafting apart, for the two butterflies' sake, that have waited outside all morning, the closed portals of the first Jerusalem rose.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question was raised at home whether, all things considered, I ought still to be sent to dine with M. Legrandin. But my grandmother refused to believe that he could have been impolite.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You admit yourself that he appears at church there, quite simply dressed, and all that; he hardly looks like a man of fashion.\" She added that; in any event, even if, at the worst, he had been intentionally rude, it was far better for us to pretend that we had noticed nothing. And indeed my father himself, though more annoyed than any of us by the attitude which Legrandin had adopted, may still have held in reserve a final uncertainty as to its true meaning. It was like every attitude or action which reveals a man's deep and hidden character; they bear no relation to what he has previously said, and we cannot confirm our suspicions by the culprit's evidence, for he will admit nothing; we are reduced to the evidence of our own senses, and we ask ourselves, in the face of this detached and incoherent fragment of recollection, whether indeed our senses have not been the victims of a hallucination; with the result that such attitudes, and these alone are of importance in indicating character, are the most apt to leave us in perplexity.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I dined with Legrandin on the terrace of his house, by moonlight. \"There is a charming quality, is there not,\" he said to me, \"in this silence; for hearts that are wounded, as mine is, a novelist, whom you will read in time to come, claims that there is no remedy but silence and shadow. And see you this, my boy, there comes in all lives a time, towards which you still have far to go, when the weary eyes can endure but one kind of light, the light which a fine evening like this prepares for us in the stillroom of darkness, when the ears can listen to no music save what the moonlight breathes through the flute of silence.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could hear what M. Legrandin was saying; like everything that he said, it sounded attractive; but I was disturbed by the memory of a lady whom I had seen recently for the first time; and thinking, now that I knew that Legrandin was on friendly terms with several of the local aristocracy, that perhaps she also was among his acquaintance, I summoned up all my courage and said to him: \"Tell me, sir, do you, by any chance, know the lady\u2014the ladies of Guermantes?\" and I felt glad because, in pronouncing the name, I had secured a sort of power over it, by the mere act of drawing it up out of my dreams and giving it an objective existence in the world of spoken things\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, at the sound of the word Guermantes, I saw in the middle of each of our friend's blue eyes a little brown dimple appear, as though they had been stabbed by some invisible pin-point, while the rest of his pupils, reacting from the shock, received and secreted the azure overflow. His fringed eyelids darkened, and drooped. His mouth, which had been stiffened and seared with bitter lines, was the first to recover, and smiled, while his eyes still seemed full of pain, like the eyes of a good-looking martyr whose body bristles with arrows\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, I do not know them,\" he said, but instead of uttering so simple a piece of information, a reply in which there was so little that could astonish me, in the natural and conversational tone which would have befitted it, he recited it with a separate stress upon each word, leaning forward, bowing his head, with at once the vehemence which a man gives, so as to be believed, to a highly improbable statement (as though the fact that he did not know the Guermantes could be due only to some strange accident of fortune) and with the emphasis of a man who, finding himself unable to keep silence about what is to him a painful situation, chooses to proclaim it aloud, so as to convince his hearers that the confession he is making is one that causes him no embarrassment, but is easy, agreeable, spontaneous, that the situation in question, in this case the absence of relations with the Guermantes family, might very well have been not forced upon, but actually designed by Legrandin himself, might arise from some family tradition, some moral principle or mystical vow which expressly forbade his seeking their society\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No,\" he resumed, explaining by his words the tone in which they were uttered. \"No, I do not know them; I have never wished to know them; I have always made a point of preserving complete independence; at heart, as you know, I am a bit of a Radical. People are always coming to me about it, telling me I am mistaken in not going to Guermantes, that I make myself seem ill-bred, uncivilised, an old bear. But that's not the sort of reputation that can frighten me; it's too true! In my heart of hearts I care for nothing in the world now but a few churches, books\u2014two or three, pictures\u2014rather more, perhaps, and the light of the moon when the fresh breeze of youth (such as yours) wafts to my nostrils the scent of gardens whose flowers my old eyes are not sharp enough, now, to distinguish.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not understand very clearly why, in order to refrain from going to the houses of people whom one did not know, it should be necessary to cling to one's independence, nor how that could give one the appearance of a savage or a bear. But what I did understand was this, that Legrandin was not altogether truthful when he said that he cared only for churches, moonlight, and youth; he cared also, he cared a very great deal, for people who lived in country houses, and would be so much afraid, when in their company, of incurring their displeasure that he would never dare to let them see that he numbered, as well, among his friends middle-class people, the families of solicitors and stockbrokers, preferring, if the truth must be known, that it should be revealed in his absence, when he was out of earshot, that judgment should go against him (if so it must) by default: in a word, he was a snob. Of course he would never have admitted all or any of this in the poetical language which my family and I so much admired. And if I asked him, \"Do you know the Guermantes family?\" Legrandin the talker would reply, \"No, I have never cared to know them.\" But unfortunately the talker was now subordinated to another Legrandin, whom he kept carefully hidden in his breast, whom he would never consciously exhibit, because this other could tell stories about our own Legrandin and about his snobbishness which would have ruined his reputation for ever; and this other Legrandin had replied to me already in that wounded look, that stiffened smile, the undue gravity of his tone in uttering those few words, in the thousand arrows by which our own Legrandin had instantaneously been stabbed and sickened, like a Saint Sebastian of snobbery:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, how you hurt me! No, I do not know the Guermantes family. Do not remind me of the great sorrow of my life.\" And since this other, this irrepressible, dominant, despotic Legrandin, if he lacked our Legrandin's charming vocabulary, shewed an infinitely greater promptness in expressing himself, by means of what are called 'reflexes,' it followed that, when Legrandin the talker attempted to silence him, he would already have spoken, and it would be useless for our friend to deplore the bad impression which the revelations of his alter ego must have caused, since he could do no more now than endeavour to mitigate them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was not to say that M. Legrandin was anything but sincere when he inveighed against snobs. He could not (from his own knowledge, at least) be aware that he was one also, since it is only with the passions of others that we are ever really familiar, and what we come to find out about our own can be no more than what other people have shewn us. Upon ourselves they react but indirectly, through our imagination, which substitutes for our actual, primary motives other, secondary motives, less stark and therefore more decent. Never had Legrandin's snobbishness impelled him to make a habit of visiting a duchess as such. Instead, it would set his imagination to make that duchess appear, in Legrandin's eyes, endowed with all the graces. He would be drawn towards the duchess, assuring himself the while that he was yielding to the attractions of her mind, and her other virtues, which the vile race of snobs could never understand. Only his fellow-snobs knew that he was of their number, for, owing to their inability to appreciate the intervening efforts of his imagination, they saw in close juxtaposition the social activities of Legrandin and their primary cause\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At home, meanwhile, we had no longer any illusions as to M. Legrandin, and our relations with him had become much more distant. Mamma would be greatly delighted whenever she caught him red-handed in the sin, which he continued to call the unpardonable sin, of snobbery. As for my father, he found it difficult to take Legrandin's airs in so light, in so detached a spirit; and when there was some talk, one year, of sending me to spend the long summer holidays at Balbec with my grandmother, he said: \"I must, most certainly, tell Legrandin that you are going to Balbec, to see whether he will offer you an introduction to his sister. He probably doesn't remember telling us that she lived within a mile of the place.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother, who held that, when one went to the seaside, one ought to be on the beach from morning to night, to taste the salt breezes, and that one should not know anyone in the place, because calls and parties and excursions were so much time stolen from what belonged, by rights, to the sea-air, begged him on no account to speak to Legrandin of our plans; for already, in her mind's eye, she could see his sister, Mme. de Cambremer, alighting from her carriage at the door of our hotel just as we were on the point of going out fishing, and obliging us to remain indoors all afternoon to entertain her. But Mamma laughed her fears to scorn, for she herself felt that the danger was not so threatening, and that Legrandin would shew no undue anxiety to make us acquainted with his sister. And, as it happened, there was no need for any of us to introduce the subject of Balbec, for it was Legrandin himself who, without the least suspicion that we had ever had any intention of visiting those parts, walked into the trap uninvited one evening, when we met him strolling on the banks of the Vivonne\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which are very beautiful, are they not, my friend?\" he said to my father. \"Especially a blue which is far more floral than atmospheric, a cineraria blue, which it is surprising to see in the sky. And that little pink cloud there, has it not just the tint of some flower, a carnation or hydrangea? Nowhere, perhaps, except on the shores of the English Channel, where Normandy merges into Brittany, have I been able to find such copious examples of what you might call a vegetable kingdom in the clouds. Down there, close to Balbec, among all those places which are still so uncivilised, there is a little bay, charmingly quiet, where the sunsets of the Auge Valley, those red-and-gold sunsets (which, all the same, I am very far from despising) seem commonplace and insignificant; for in that moist and gentle atmosphere these heavenly flower-beds will break into blossom, in a few moments, in the evenings, incomparably lovely, and often lasting for hours before they fade. Others shed their leaves at once, and then it is more beautiful still to see the sky strewn with the scattering of their innumerable petals, sulphurous yellow and rosy red. In that bay, which they call the Opal Bay, the golden sands appear more charming still from being fastened, like fair Andromeda, to those terrible rocks of the surrounding coast, to that funereal shore, famed for the number of its wrecks, where every winter many a brave vessel falls a victim to the perils of the sea. Balbec! the oldest bone in the geological skeleton that underlies our soil, the true Armor, the sea, the land's end, the accursed region which Anatole France\u2014an enchanter whose works our young friend ought to read\u2014has so well depicted, beneath its eternal fogs, as though it were indeed the land of the Cimmerians in the Odyssey. Balbec; yes, they are building hotels there now, superimposing them upon its ancient and charming soil, which they are powerless to alter; how delightful it is, down there, to be able to step out at once into regions so primitive and so entrancing.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Indeed! And do you know anyone at Balbec?\" inquired my father. \"This young man is just going to spend a couple of months there with his grandmother, and my wife too, perhaps.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legrandin, taken unawares by the question at a moment when he was looking directly at my father, was unable to turn aside his gaze, and so concentrated it with steadily increasing intensity\u2014smiling mournfully the while\u2014upon the eyes of his questioner, with an air of friendliness and frankness and of not being afraid to look him in the face, until he seemed to have penetrated my father's skull, as it had been a ball of glass, and to be seeing, at the moment, a long way beyond and behind it, a brightly coloured cloud, which provided him with a mental alibi, and would enable him to establish the theory that, just when he was being asked whether he knew anyone at Balbec, he had been thinking of something else, and so had not heard the question. As a rule these tactics make the questioner proceed to ask, \"Why, what are you thinking about?\" But my father, inquisitive, annoyed, and cruel, repeated: \"Have you friends, then, in that neighbourhood, that you know Balbec so well?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a final and desperate effort the smiling gaze of Legrandin struggled to the extreme limits of its tenderness, vagueness, candour, and distraction; then feeling, no doubt, that there was nothing left for it now but to answer, he said to us: \"I have friends all the world over, wherever there are companies of trees, stricken but not defeated, which have come together to offer a common supplication, with pathetic obstinacy, to an inclement sky which has no mercy upon them.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That is not quite what I meant,\" interrupted my father, obstinate as a tree and merciless as the sky. \"I asked you, in case anything should happen to my mother-in-law and she wanted to feel that she was not all alone down there, at the ends of the earth, whether you knew any of the people.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There as elsewhere, I know everyone and I know no one,\" replied Legrandin, who was by no means ready yet to surrender; \"places I know well, people very slightly. But, down there, the places themselves seem to me just like people, rare and wonderful people, of a delicate quality which would have been corrupted and ruined by the gift of life. Perhaps it is a castle which you encounter upon the cliff's edge; standing there by the roadside, where it has halted to contemplate its sorrows before an evening sky, still rosy, through which a golden moon is climbing; while the fishing-boats, homeward bound, creasing the watered silk of the Channel, hoist its pennant at their mastheads and carry its colours. Or perhaps it is a simple dwelling-house that stands alone, ugly, if anything, timid-seeming but full of romance, hiding from every eye some imperishable secret of happiness and disenchantment. That land which knows not truth,\" he continued with Machiavellian subtlety, \"that land of infinite fiction makes bad reading for any boy; and is certainly not what I should choose or recommend for my young friend here, who is already so much inclined to melancholy, for a heart already predisposed to receive its impressions. Climates that breathe amorous secrets and futile regrets may agree with an old and disillusioned man like myself; but they must always prove fatal to a temperament which is still unformed. Believe me,\" he went on with emphasis, \"the waters of that bay\u2014more Breton than Norman\u2014may exert a sedative influence, though even that is of questionable value, upon a heart which, like mine, is no longer unbroken, a heart for whose wounds there is no longer anything to compensate. But at your age, my boy, those waters are contra-indicated.... Good night to you, neighbours,\" he added, moving away from us with that evasive abruptness to which we were accustomed; and then, turning towards us, with a physicianly finger raised in warning, he resumed the consultation: \"No Balbec before you are fifty!\" he called out to me, \"and even then it must depend on the state of the heart.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father spoke to him of it again, as often as we met him, and tortured him with questions, but it was labour in vain: like that scholarly swindler who devoted to the fabrication of forged palimpsests a wealth of skill and knowledge and industry the hundredth part of which would have sufficed to establish him in a more lucrative\u2014but an honourable occupation, M. Legrandin, had we insisted further, would in the end have constructed a whole system of ethics, and a celestial geography of Lower Normandy, sooner than admit to us that, within a mile of Balbec, his own sister was living in her own house; sooner than find himself obliged to offer us a letter of introduction, the prospect of which would never have inspired him with such terror had he been absolutely certain\u2014as, from his knowledge of my grandmother's character, he really ought to have been certain\u2014that in no circumstances whatsoever would we have dreamed of making use of it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We used always to return from our walks in good time to pay aunt L\u00e9onie a visit before dinner. In the first weeks of our Combray holidays, when the days ended early, we would still be able to see, as we turned into the Rue du Saint-Esprit, a reflection of the western sky from the windows of the house and a band of purple at the foot of the Calvary, which was mirrored further on in the pond; a fiery glow which, accompanied often by a cold that burned and stung, would associate itself in my mind with the glow of the fire over which, at that very moment, was roasting the chicken that was to furnish me, in place of the poetic pleasure I had found in my walk, with the sensual pleasures of good feeding, warmth and rest. But in summer, when we came back to the house, the sun would not have set; and while we were upstairs paying our visit to aunt L\u00e9onie its rays, sinking until they touched and lay along her window-sill, would there be caught and held by the large inner curtains and the bands which tied them back to the wall, and split and scattered and filtered; and then, at last, would fall upon and inlay with tiny flakes of gold the lemonwood of her chest-of-drawers, illuminating the room in their passage with the same delicate, slanting, shadowed beams that fall among the boles of forest trees. But on some days, though very rarely, the chest-of-drawers would long since have shed its momentary adornments, there would no longer, as we turned into the Rue du Saint-Esprit, be any reflection from the western sky burning along the line of window-panes; the pond beneath the Calvary would have lost its fiery glow, sometimes indeed had changed already to an opalescent pallor, while a long ribbon of moonlight, bent and broken and broadened by every ripple upon the water's surface, would be lying across it, from end to end. Then, as we drew near the house, we would make out a figure standing upon the doorstep, and Mamma would say to me: \"Good heavens! There is Fran\u00e7oise looking out for us; your aunt must be anxious; that means we are late.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And without wasting time by stopping to take off our 'things' we would fly upstairs to my aunt L\u00e9onie's room to reassure her, to prove to her by our bodily presence that all her gloomy imaginings were false, that, on the contrary, nothing had happened to us, but that we had gone the 'Guermantes way,' and, good lord, when one took that walk, my aunt knew well enough that one could never say at what time one would be home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There, Fran\u00e7oise,\" my aunt would say, \"didn't I tell you that they must have gone the Guermantes way? Good gracious! They must be hungry! And your nice leg of mutton will be quite dried up now, after all the hours it's been waiting. What a time to come in! Well, and so you went the Guermantes way?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, Leonie, I supposed you knew,\" Mamma would answer. \"I thought that Fran\u00e7oise had seen us go out by the little gate, through the kitchen-garden.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For there were, in the environs of Combray, two 'ways' which we used to take for our walks, and so diametrically opposed that we would actually leave the house by a different door, according to the way we had chosen: the way towards M\u00e9s\u00e9glise-la-Vineuse, which we called also 'Swann's way,' because, to get there, one had to pass along the boundary of M. Swann's estate, and the 'Guermantes way.' Of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise-la-Vineuse, to tell the truth, I never knew anything more than the way there, and the strange people who would come over on Sundays to take the air in Combray, people whom, this time, neither my aunt nor any of us would 'know at all,' and whom we would therefore assume to be 'people who must have come over from M\u00e9s\u00e9glise.' As for Guermantes, I was to know it well enough one day, but that day had still to come; and, during the whole of my boyhood, if M\u00e9s\u00e9glise was to me something as inaccessible as the horizon, which remained hidden from sight, however far one went, by the folds of a country which no longer bore the least resemblance to the country round Combray; Guermantes, on the other hand, meant no more than the ultimate goal, ideal rather than real, of the 'Guermantes way,' a sort of abstract geographical term like the North Pole or the Equator. And so to 'take the Guermantes way' in order to get to M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, or vice versa, would have seemed to me as nonsensical a proceeding as to turn to the east in order to reach the west. Since my father used always to speak of the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' as comprising the finest view of a plain that he knew anywhere, and of the 'Guermantes way' as typical of river scenery, I had invested each of them, by conceiving them in this way as two distinct entities, with that cohesion, that unity which belongs only to the figments of the mind; the smallest detail of either of them appeared to me as a precious thing, which exhibited the special excellence of the whole, while, immediately beside them, in the first stages of our walk, before we had reached the sacred soil of one or the other, the purely material roads, at definite points on which they were set down as the ideal view over a plain and the ideal scenery of a river, were no more worth the trouble of looking at them than, to a keen playgoer and lover of dramatic art, are the little streets which may happen to run past the walls of a theatre. But, above all, I set between them, far more distinctly than the mere distance in miles and yards and inches which separated one from the other, the distance that there was between the two parts of my brain in which I used to think of them, one of those distances of the mind which time serves only to lengthen, which separate things irremediably from one another, keeping them for ever upon different planes. And this distinction was rendered still more absolute because the habit we had of never going both ways on the same day, or in the course of the same walk, but the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' one time and the 'Guermantes way' another, shut them up, so to speak, far apart and unaware of each other's existence, in the sealed vessels\u2014between which there could be no communication\u2014of separate afternoons\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When we had decided to go the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' we would start (without undue haste, and even if the sky were clouded over, since the walk was not very long, and did not take us too far from home), as though we were not going anywhere in particular, by the front-door of my aunt's house, which opened on to the Rue du Saint-Esprit. We would be greeted by the gunsmith, we would drop our letters into the box, we would tell Th\u00e9odore, from Fran\u00e7oise, as we passed, that she had run out of oil or coffee, and we would leave the town by the road which ran along the white fence of M. Swann's park. Before reaching it we would be met on our way by the scent of his lilac-trees, come out to welcome strangers. Out of the fresh little green hearts of their foliage the lilacs raised inquisitively over the fence of the park their plumes of white or purple blossom, which glowed, even in the shade, with the sunlight in which they had been bathed. Some of them, half-concealed by the little tiled house, called the Archers' Lodge, in which Swann's keeper lived, overtopped its gothic gable with their rosy minaret. The nymphs of spring would have seemed coarse and vulgar in comparison with these young houris, who retained, in this French garden, the pure and vivid colouring of a Persian miniature. Despite my desire to throw my arms about their pliant forms and to draw down towards me the starry locks that crowned their fragrant heads, we would pass them by without stopping, for my parents had ceased to visit Tansonville since Swann's marriage, and, so as not to appear to be looking into his park, we would, instead of taking the road which ran beside its boundary and then climbed straight up to the open fields, choose another way, which led in the same direction, but circuitously, and brought us out rather too far from home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day my grandfather said to my 'father: \"Don't you remember Swann's telling us yesterday that his wife and daughter had gone off to Rheims and that he was taking the opportunity of spending a day or two in Paris? We might go along by the park, since the ladies are not at home; that will make it a little shorter.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We stopped for a moment by the fence. Lilac-time was nearly over; some of the trees still thrust aloft, in tall purple chandeliers, their tiny balls of blossom, but in many places among their foliage where, only a week before, they had still been breaking in waves of fragrant foam, these were now spent and shrivelled and discoloured, a hollow scum, dry and scentless. My grandfather pointed out to my father in what respects the appearance of the place was still the same, and how far it had altered since the walk that he had taken with old M. Swann, on the day of his wife's death; and he seized the opportunity to tell us, once again, the story of that walk\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In front of us a path bordered with nasturtiums rose in the full glare of the sun towards the house. But to our right the park stretched away into the distance, on level ground. Overshadowed by the tall trees which stood close around it, an 'ornamental water' had been constructed by Swann's parents but, even in his most artificial creations, nature is the material upon which man has to work; certain spots will persist in remaining surrounded by the vassals of their own especial sovereignty, and will raise their immemorial standards among all the 'laid-out' scenery of a park, just as they would have done far from any human interference, in a solitude which must everywhere return to engulf them, springing up out of the necessities of their exposed position, and superimposing itself upon the work of man's hands. And so it was that, at the foot of the path which led down to this artificial lake, there might be seen, in its two tiers woven of trailing forget-me-nots below and of periwinkle flowers above, the natural, delicate, blue garland which binds the luminous, shadowed brows of water-nymphs; while the iris, its swords sweeping every way in regal profusion, stretched out over agrimony and water-growing king-cups the lilied sceptres, tattered glories of yellow and purple, of the kingdom of the lake\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The absence of Mlle. Swann, which\u2014since it preserved me from the terrible risk of seeing her appear on one of the paths, and of being identified and scorned by this so privileged little girl who had Bergotte for a friend and used to go with him to visit cathedrals\u2014made the exploration of Tansonville, now for the first time permitted me, a matter of indifference to myself, seemed however to invest the property, in my grandfather's and father's eyes, with a fresh and transient charm, and (like an entirely cloudless sky when one is going mountaineering) to make the day extraordinarily propitious for a walk in this direction; I should have liked to see their reckoning proved false, to see, by a miracle, Mlle. Swann appear, with her father, so close to us that we should not have time to escape, and should therefore be obliged to make her acquaintance. And so, when I suddenly noticed a straw basket lying forgotten on the grass by the side of a line whose float was bobbing in the water, I made a great effort to keep my father and grandfather looking in another direction, away from this sign that she might, after all, be in residence. Still, as Swann had told us that he ought not, really, to go away just then, as he had some people staying in the house, the line might equally belong to one of these guests. Not a footstep was to be heard on any of the paths. Somewhere in one of the tall trees, making a stage in its height, an invisible bird, desperately attempting to make the day seem shorter, was exploring with a long, continuous note the solitude that pressed it on every side, but it received at once so unanimous an answer, so powerful a repercussion of silence and of immobility that, one would have said, it had arrested for all eternity the moment which it had been trying to make pass more quickly. The sunlight fell so implacably from a fixed sky that one was naturally inclined to slip away out of the reach of its attentions, and even the slumbering water, whose repose was perpetually being invaded by the insects that swarmed above its surface, while it dreamed, no doubt, of some imaginary maelstrom, intensified the uneasiness which the sight of that floating cork had wrought in me, by appearing to draw it at full speed across the silent reaches of a mirrored firmament; now almost vertical, it seemed on the point of plunging down out of sight, and I had begun to ask myself whether, setting aside the longing and the terror that I had of making her acquaintance, it was not actually my duty to warn Mlle. Swann that the fish was biting\u2014when I was obliged to run after my father and grandfather, who were calling me, and were surprised that I had not followed them along the little path, climbing up hill towards the open fields, into which they had already turned. I found the whole path throbbing with the fragrance of hawthorn-blossom. The hedge resembled a series of chapels, whose walls were no longer visible under the mountains of flowers that were heaped upon their altars; while underneath, the sun cast a square of light upon the ground, as though it had shone in upon them through a window; the scent that swept out over me from them was as rich, and as circumscribed in its range, as though I had been standing before the Lady-altar, and the flowers, themselves adorned also, held out each its little bunch of glittering stamens with an air of inattention, fine, radiating 'nerves' in the flamboyant style of architecture, like those which, in church, framed the stair to the rood-loft or closed the perpendicular tracery of the windows, but here spread out into pools of fleshy white, like strawberry-beds in spring. How simple and rustic, in comparison with these, would seem the dog-roses which, in a few weeks' time, would be climbing the same hillside path in the heat of the sun, dressed in the smooth silk of their blushing pink bodices, which would be undone and scattered by the first breath of wind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But it was in vain that I lingered before the hawthorns, to breathe in, to marshal before my mind (which knew not what to make of it), to lose in order to rediscover their invisible and unchanging odour, to absorb myself in the rhythm which disposed their flowers here and there with the light-heartedness of youth, and at intervals as unexpected as certain intervals of music; they offered me an indefinite continuation of the same charm, in an inexhaustible profusion, but without letting me delve into it any more deeply, like those melodies which one can play over a hundred times in succession without coming any nearer to their secret. I turned away from them for a moment so as to be able to return to them with renewed strength. My eyes followed up the slope which, outside the hedge, rose steeply to the fields, a poppy that had strayed and been lost by its fellows, or a few cornflowers that had fallen lazily behind, and decorated the ground here and there with their flowers like the border of a tapestry, in which may be seen at intervals hints of the rustic theme which appears triumphant in the panel itself; infrequent still, spaced apart as the scattered houses which warn us that we are approaching a village, they betokened to me the vast expanse of waving corn beneath the fleecy clouds, and the sight of a single poppy hoisting upon its slender rigging and holding against the breeze its scarlet ensign, over the buoy of rich black earth from which it sprang, made my heart beat as does a wayfarer's when he perceives, upon some low-lying ground, an old and broken boat which is being caulked and made seaworthy, and cries out, although he has not yet caught sight of it, \"The Sea!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then I returned to my hawthorns, and stood before them as one stands before those masterpieces of painting which, one imagines, one will be better able to 'take in' when one has looked away, for a moment, at something else; but in vain did I shape my fingers into a frame, so as to have nothing but the hawthorns before my eyes; the sentiment which they aroused in me remained obscure and vague, struggling and failing to free itself, to float across and become one with the flowers. They themselves offered me no enlightenment, and I could not call upon any other flowers to satisfy this mysterious longing. And then, inspiring me with that rapture which we feel on seeing a work by our favourite painter quite different from any of those that we already know, or, better still, when some one has taken us and set us down in front of a picture of which we have hitherto seen no more than a pencilled sketch, or when a piece of music which we have heard played over on the piano bursts out again in our ears with all the splendour and fullness of an orchestra, my grandfather called me to him, and, pointing to the hedge of Tansonville, said: \"You are fond of hawthorns; just look at this pink one; isn't it pretty?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it was indeed a hawthorn, but one whose flowers were pink, and lovelier even than the white. It, too, was in holiday attire, for one of those days which are the only true holidays, the holy days of religion, because they are not appointed by any capricious accident, as secular holidays are appointed, upon days which are not specially ordained for such observances, which have nothing about them that is essentially festal\u2014but it was attired even more richly than the rest, for the flowers which clung to its branches, one above another, so thickly as to leave no part of the tree undecorated, like the tassels wreathed about the crook of a rococo shepherdess, were every one of them 'in colour,' and consequently of a superior quality, by the aesthetic standards of Combray, to the 'plain,' if one was to judge by the scale of prices at the 'stores' in the Square, or at Camus's, where the most expensive biscuits were those whose sugar was pink. And for my own part I set a higher value on cream cheese when it was pink, when I had been allowed to tinge it with crushed strawberries. And these flowers had chosen precisely the colour of some edible and delicious thing, or of some exquisite addition to one's costume for a great festival, which colours, inasmuch as they make plain the reason for their superiority, are those whose beauty is most evident to the eyes of children, and for that reason must always seem more vivid and more natural than any other tints, even after the child's mind has realised that they offer no gratification to the appetite, and have not been selected by the dressmaker. And, indeed, I had felt at once, as I had felt before the white blossom, but now still more marvelling, that it was in no artificial manner, by no device of human construction, that the festal intention of these flowers was revealed, but that it was Nature herself who had spontaneously expressed it (with the simplicity of a woman from a village shop, labouring at the decoration of a street altar for some procession) by burying the bush in these little rosettes, almost too ravishing in colour, this rustic 'pompadour.' High up on the branches, like so many of those tiny rose-trees, their pots concealed in jackets of paper lace, whose slender stems rise in a forest from the altar on the greater festivals, a thousand buds were swelling and opening, paler in colour, but each disclosing as it burst, as at the bottom of a cup of pink marble, its blood-red stain, and suggesting even more strongly than the full-blown flowers the special, irresistible quality of the hawthorn-tree, which, wherever it budded, wherever it was about to blossom, could bud and blossom in pink flowers alone. Taking its place in the hedge, but as different from the rest as a young girl in holiday attire among a crowd of dowdy women in everyday clothes, who are staying at home, equipped and ready for the 'Month of Mary,' of which it seemed already to form a part, it shone and smiled in its cool, rosy garments, a Catholic bush indeed, and altogether delightful\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The hedge allowed us a glimpse, inside the park, of an alley bordered with jasmine, pansies, and verbenas, among which the stocks held open their fresh plump purses, of a pink as fragrant and as faded as old Spanish leather, while on the gravel-path a long watering-pipe, painted green, coiling across the ground, poured, where its holes were, over the flowers whose perfume those holes inhaled, a vertical and prismatic fan of infinitesimal, rainbow-coloured drops. Suddenly I stood still, unable to move, as happens when something appears that requires not only our eyes to take it in, but involves a deeper kind of perception and takes possession of the whole of our being. A little girl, with fair, reddish hair, who appeared to be returning from a walk, and held a trowel in her hand, was looking at us, raising towards us a face powdered with pinkish freckles. Her black eyes gleamed, and as I did not at that time know, and indeed have never since learned how to reduce to its objective elements any strong impression, since I had not, as they say, enough 'power of observation' to isolate the sense of their colour, for a long time afterwards, whenever I thought of her, the memory of those bright eyes would at once present itself to me as a vivid azure, since her complexion was fair; so much so that, perhaps, if her eyes had not been quite so black\u2014which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting her\u2014I should not have been, as I was, especially enamoured of their imagined blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I gazed at her, at first with that gaze which is not merely a messenger from the eyes, but in whose window all the senses assemble and lean out, petrified and anxious, that gaze which would fain reach, touch, capture, bear off in triumph the body at which it is aimed, and the soul with the body; then (so frightened was I lest at any moment my grandfather and father, catching sight of the girl, might tear me away from her, by making me run on in front of them) with another, an unconsciously appealing look, whose object was to force her to pay attention to me, to see, to know me. She cast a glance forwards and sideways, so as to take stock of my grandfather and father, and doubtless the impression she formed of them was that we were all absurd people, for she turned away with an indifferent and contemptuous air, withdrew herself so as to spare her face the indignity of remaining within their field of vision; and while they, continuing to walk on without noticing her, had overtaken and passed me, she allowed her eyes to wander, over the space that lay between us, in my direction, without any particular expression, without appearing to have seen me, but with an intensity, a half-hidden smile which I was unable to interpret, according to the instruction I had received in the ways of good breeding, save as a mark of infinite disgust; and her hand, at the same time, sketched in the air an indelicate gesture, for which, when it was addressed in public to a person whom one did not know, the little dictionary of manners which I carried in my mind supplied only one meaning, namely, a deliberate insult\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Gilberte, come along; what are you doing?\" called out in a piercing tone of authority a lady in white, whom I had not seen until that moment, while, a little way beyond her, a gentleman in a suit of linen 'ducks,' whom I did not know either, stared at me with eyes which seemed to be starting from his head; the little girl's smile abruptly faded, and, seizing her trowel, she made off without turning to look again in my direction, with an air of obedience, inscrutable and sly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so was wafted to my ears the name of Gilberte, bestowed on me like a talisman which might, perhaps, enable me some day to rediscover her whom its syllables had just endowed with a definite personality, whereas, a moment earlier, she had been only something vaguely seen. So it came to me, uttered across the heads of the stocks and jasmines, pungent and cool as the drops which fell from the green watering-pipe; impregnating and irradiating the zone of pure air through which it had passed, which it set apart and isolated from all other air, with the mystery of the life of her whom its syllables designated to the happy creatures that lived and walked and travelled in her company; unfolding through the arch of the pink hawthorn, which opened at the height of my shoulder, the quintessence of their familiarity\u2014so exquisitely painful to myself\u2014with her, and with all that unknown world of her existence, into which I should never penetrate\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For a moment (while we moved away, and my grandfather murmured: \"Poor Swann, what a life they are leading him; fancy sending him away so that she can be left alone with her Charlus\u2014for that was Charlus: I recognised him at once! And the child, too; at her age, to be mixed up in all that!\") the impression left on me by the despotic tone in which Gilberte's mother had spoken to her, without her replying, by exhibiting her to me as being obliged to yield obedience to some one else, as not being indeed superior to the whole world, calmed my sufferings somewhat, revived some hope in me, and cooled the ardour of my love. But very soon that love surged up again in me like a reaction by which my humiliated heart was endeavouring to rise to Gilberte's level, or to draw her down to its own. I loved her; I was sorry not to have had the time and the inspiration to insult her, to do her some injury, to force her to keep some memory of me. I knew her to be so beautiful that I should have liked to be able to retrace my steps so as to shake my fist at her and shout, \"I think you are hideous, grotesque; you are utterly disgusting!\" However, I walked away, carrying with me, then and for ever afterwards, as the first illustration of a type of happiness rendered inaccessible to a little boy of my kind by certain laws of nature which it was impossible to transgress, the picture of a little girl with reddish hair, and a skin freckled with tiny pink marks, who held a trowel in her hand, and smiled as she directed towards me a long and subtle and inexpressive stare. And already the charm with which her name, like a cloud of incense, had filled that archway in the pink hawthorn through which she and I had, together, heard its sound, was beginning to conquer, to cover, to embalm, to beautify everything with which it had any association: her grandparents, whom my own had been so unspeakably fortunate as to know, the glorious profession of a stockholder, even the melancholy neighbourhood of the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, where she lived in Paris.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"L\u00e9onie,\" said my grandfather on our return, \"I wish we had had you with us this afternoon. You would never have known Tansonville. If I had had the courage I would have cut you a branch of that pink hawthorn you used to like so much.\" And so my grandfather told her the story of our walk, either just to amuse her, or perhaps because there was still some hope that she might be stimulated to rise from her bed and to go out of doors. For in earlier days she had been very fond of Tansonville, and, moreover, Swann's visits had been the last that she had continued to receive, at a time when she had already closed her doors to all the world. And just as, when he called, in these later days, to inquire for her (and she was still the only person in our household whom he would ask to see), she would send down to say that she was tired at the moment and resting, but that she would be happy to see him another time, so, this evening, she said to my grandfather, \"Yes, some day when the weather is fine I shall go for a drive as far as the gate of the park.\" And in saying this she was quite sincere. She would have liked to see Swann and Tansonville again; but the mere wish to do so sufficed for all that remained of her strength, which its fulfilment would have more than exhausted. Sometimes a spell of fine weather made her a little more energetic, she would rise and put on her clothes; but before she had reached the outer room she would be 'tired' again, and would insist on returning to her bed. The process which had begun in her\u2014and in her a little earlier only than it must come to all of us\u2014was the great and general renunciation which old age makes in preparation for death, the chrysalis stage of life, which may be observed wherever life has been unduly prolonged; even in old lovers who have lived for one another with the utmost intensity of passion, and in old friends bound by the closest ties of mental sympathy, who, after a certain year, cease to make, the necessary journey, or even to cross the street to see one another, cease to correspond, and know well that they will communicate no more in this world. My aunt must have been perfectly well aware that she would not see Swann again, that she would never leave her own house any more, but this ultimate seclusion seemed to be accepted by her with all the more readiness for the very reason which, to our minds, ought to have made it more unbearable; namely, that such a seclusion was forced upon her by the gradual and steady diminution in her strength which she was able to measure daily, which, by making every action, every movement 'tiring' to her if not actually painful, gave to inaction, isolation and silence the blessed, strengthening and refreshing charm of repose.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My aunt did not go to see the pink hawthorn in the hedge, but at all hours of the day I would ask the rest of my family whether she was not going to go, whether she used not, at one time, to go often to Tansonville, trying to make them speak of Mile. Swann's parents and grandparents, who appeared to me to be as great and glorious as gods. The name, which had for me become almost mythological, of Swann\u2014when I talked with my family I would grow sick with longing to hear them utter it; I dared not pronounce it myself, but I would draw them into a discussion of matters which led naturally to Gilberte and her family, in which she was involved, in speaking of which I would feel myself not too remotely banished from her company; and I would suddenly force my father (by pretending, for instance, to believe that my grandfather's business had been in our family before his day, or that the hedge with the pink hawthorn which my aunt L\u00e9onie wished to visit was on common ground) to correct my statements, to say, as though in opposition to me and of his own accord: \"No, no, the business belonged to Swann's father, that hedge is part of Swann's park.\" And then I would be obliged to pause for breath; so stifling was the pressure, upon that part of me where it was for ever inscribed, of that name which, at the moment when I heard it, seemed to me fuller, more portentous than any other name, because it was burdened with the weight of all the occasions on which I had secretly uttered it in my mind. It caused me a pleasure which I was ashamed to have dared to demand from my parents, for so great was it that to have procured it for me must have involved them in an immensity of effort, and with no recompense, since for them there was no pleasure in the sound. And so I would prudently turn the conversation. And by a scruple of conscience, also. All the singular seductions which I had stored up in the sound of that word Swann, I found again as soon as it was uttered. And then it occurred to me suddenly that my parents could not fail to experience the same emotions, that they must find themselves sharing my point of view, that they perceived in their turn, that they condoned, that they even embraced my visionary longings, and I was as wretched as though I had ravished and corrupted the innocence of their hearts.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That year my family fixed the day of their return to Paris rather earlier than usual. On the morning of our departure I had had my hair curled, to be ready to face the photographer, had had a new hat carefully set upon my head, and had been buttoned into a velvet jacket; a little later my mother, after searching everywhere for me, found me standing in tears on that steep little hillside close to Tansonville, bidding a long farewell to my hawthorns, clasping their sharp branches to my bosom, and (like a princess in a tragedy, oppressed by the weight of all her senseless jewellery) with no gratitude towards the officious hand which had, in curling those ringlets, been at pains to collect all my hair upon my forehead; trampling underfoot the curl-papers which I had torn from my head, and my new hat with them. My mother was not at all moved by my tears, but she could not suppress a cry at the sight of my battered headgear and my ruined jacket. I did not, however, hear her. \"Oh, my poor little hawthorns,\" I was assuring them through my sobs, \"it is not you that want to make me unhappy, to force me to leave you. You, you have never done me any harm. So I shall always love you.\" And, drying my eyes, I promised them that, when I grew up, I would never copy the foolish example of other men, but that even in Paris, on fine spring days, instead of paying calls and listening to silly talk, I would make excursions into the country to see the first hawthorn-trees in bloom.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once in the fields we never left them again during the rest of our M\u00e9s\u00e9glise walk. They were perpetually crossed, as though by invisible streams of traffic, by the wind, which was to me the tutelary genius of Combray. Every year, on the day of our arrival, in order to feel that I really was at Combray, I would climb the hill to find it running again through my clothing, and setting me running in its wake. One always had the wind for companion when one went the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way,' on that swelling plain which stretched, mile beyond mile, without any disturbance of its gentle contour. I knew that Mlle. Swann used often to go and spend a few days at Laon, and, for all that it was many miles away, the distance was obviated by the absence of any intervening obstacle; when, on hot afternoons, I would see a breath of wind emerge from the farthest horizon, bowing the heads of the corn in distant fields, pouring like a flood over all that vast expanse, and finally settling down, warm and rustling, among the clover and sainfoin at my feet, that plain which was common to us both seemed then to draw us together, to unite us; I would imagine that the same breath had passed by her also, that there was some message from her in what it was whispering to me, without my being able to understand it, and I would catch and kiss it as it passed. On my left was a village called Champieu (Campus Pagani, according to the Cur\u00e9). On my right I could see across the cornfields the two crocketed, rustic spires of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, themselves as tapering, scaly, plated, honeycombed, yellowed, and roughened as two ears of wheat.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At regular intervals, among the inimitable ornamentation of their leaves, which can be mistaken for those of no other fruit-tree, the apple-trees were exposing their broad petals of white satin, or hanging in shy bunches their unopened, blushing buds. It was while going the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' that I first noticed the circular shadow which apple-trees cast upon the sunlit ground, and also those impalpable threads of golden silk which the setting sun weaves slantingly downwards from beneath their leaves, and which I would see my father slash through with his stick without ever making them swerve from their straight path.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes in the afternoon sky a white moon would creep up like a little cloud, furtive, without display, suggesting an actress who does not have to 'come on' for a while, and so goes 'in front' in her ordinary clothes to watch the rest of the company for a moment, but keeps in the background, not wishing to attract attention to herself. I was glad to find her image reproduced in books and paintings, though these works of art were very different\u2014at least in my earlier years, before Bloch had attuned my eyes and mind to more subtle harmonies\u2014from those in which the moon seems fair to me to-day, but in which I should not have recognised her then. It might be, for instance, some novel by Saintine, some landscape by Gleyre, in which she is cut out sharply against the sky, in the form of a silver sickle, some work as unsophisticated and as incomplete as were, at that date, my own impressions, and which it enraged my grandmother's sisters to see me admire. They held that one ought to set before children, and that children shewed their own innate good taste in admiring, only such books and pictures as they would continue to admire when their minds were developed and mature. No doubt they regarded aesthetic values as material objects which an unclouded vision could not fail to discern, without needing to have their equivalent in experience of life stored up and slowly ripening in one's heart.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was along the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way,' at Montjouvain, a house built on the edge of a large pond, and overlooked by a steep, shrub-grown hill, that M. Vinteuil lived. And so we used often to meet his daughter driving her dogcart at full speed along the road. After a certain year we never saw her alone, but always accompanied by a friend, a girl older than herself, with an evil reputation in the neighbourhood, who in the end installed herself permanently, one day, at Montjouvain. People said: \"That poor M. Vinteuil must be blinded by love not to see what everyone is talking about, and to let his daughter\u2014a man who is horrified if you use a word in the wrong sense\u2014bring a woman like that to live under his roof. He says that she is a most superior woman, with a heart of gold, and that she would have shewn extraordinary musical talent if she had only been trained. He may be sure it is not music that she is teaching his daughter.\" But M. Vinteuil assured them that it was, and indeed it is remarkable that people never fail to arouse admiration of their normal qualities in the relatives of anyone with whom they are in physical intercourse. Bodily passion, which has been so unjustly decried, compels its victims to display every vestige that is in them of unselfishness and generosity, and so effectively that they shine resplendent in the eyes of all beholders. Dr. Percepied, whose loud voice and bushy eyebrows enabled him to play to his heart's content the part of 'double-dealer,' a part to which he was not, otherwise, adapted, without in the least degree compromising his unassailable and quite unmerited reputation of being a kind-hearted old curmudgeon, could make the Cur\u00e9 and everyone else laugh until they cried by saying in a harsh voice: \"What d'ye say to this, now? It seems that she plays music with her friend, Mile. Vinteuil. That surprises you, does it? Oh, I know nothing, nothing at all. It was Papa Vinteuil who told me all about it yesterday. After all, she has every right to be fond of music, that girl. I should never dream of thwarting the artistic vocation of a child; nor Vinteuil either, it seems. And then he plays music too, with his daughter's friend. Why, gracious heavens, it must be a regular musical box, that house out there! What are you laughing at? I say they've been playing too much music, those people. I met Papa Vinteuil the other day, by the cemetery. It was all he could do to keep on his feet.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anyone who, like ourselves, had seen M. Vinteuil, about this time, avoiding people whom he knew, and turning away as soon as he caught sight of them, changed in a few months into an old man, engulfed in a sea of sorrows, incapable of any effort not directly aimed at promoting his daughter's happiness, spending whole days beside his wife's grave, could hardly have failed to realise that he was gradually dying of a broken heart, could hardly have supposed that he paid no attention to the rumours which were going about. He knew, perhaps he even believed, what his neighbours were saying. There is probably no one, however rigid his virtue, who is not liable to find himself, by the complexity of circumstances, living at close quarters with the very vice which he himself has been most outspoken in condemning, without at first recognising it beneath the disguise which it assumes on entering his presence, so as to wound him and to make him suffer; the odd words, the unaccountable attitude, one evening, of a person whom he has a thousand reasons for loving. But for a man of M. Vinteuil's sensibility it must have been far more painful than for a hardened man of the world to have to resign himself to one of those situations which are wrongly supposed to occur in Bohemian circles only; for they are produced whenever there needs to establish itself in the security necessary to its development a vice which Nature herself has planted in the soul of a child, perhaps by no more than blending the virtues of its father and mother, as she might blend the colours of their eyes. And yet however much M. Vinteuil may have known of his daughter's conduct it did not follow that his adoration of her grew any less. The facts of life do not penetrate to the sphere in which our beliefs are cherished; as it was not they that engendered those beliefs, so they are powerless to destroy them; they can aim at them continual blows of contradiction and disproof without weakening them; and an avalanche of miseries and maladies coming, one after another, without interruption into the bosom of a family, will not make it lose faith in either the clemency of its God or the capacity of its physician. But when M. Vinteuil regarded his daughter and himself from the point of view of the world, and of their reputation, when he attempted to place himself by her side in the rank which they occupied in the general estimation of their neighbours, then he was bound to give judgment, to utter his own and her social condemnation in precisely the terms which the inhabitant of Combray most hostile to him and his daughter would have employed; he saw himself and her in 'low,' in the very 'lowest water,' inextricably stranded; and his manners had of late been tinged with that humility, that respect for persons who ranked above him and to whom he must now look up (however far beneath him they might hitherto have been), that tendency to search for some means of rising again to their level, which is an almost mechanical result of any human misfortune.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day, when we were walking with Swann in one of the streets of Combray, M. Vinteuil, turning out of another street, found himself so suddenly face to face with us all that he had not time to escape; and Swann, with that almost arrogant charity of a man of the world who, amid the dissolution of all his own moral prejudices, finds in another's shame merely a reason for treating him with a friendly benevolence, the outward signs of which serve to enhance and gratify the self-esteem of the bestower because he feels that they are all the more precious to him upon whom they are bestowed, conversed at great length with M. Vinteuil, with whom for a long time he had been barely on speaking terms, and invited him, before leaving us, to send his daughter over, one day, to play at Tansonville. It was an invitation which, two years earlier, would have enraged M. Vinteuil, but which now filled him with so much gratitude that he felt himself obliged to refrain from the indiscretion of accepting. Swann's friendly regard for his daughter seemed to him to be in itself so honourable, so precious a support for his cause that he felt it would perhaps be better to make no use of it, so as to have the wholly Platonic satisfaction of keeping it in reserve.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What a charming man!\" he said to us, after Swann had gone, with the same enthusiasm and veneration which make clever and pretty women of the middle classes fall victims to the physical and intellectual charms of a duchess, even though she be ugly and a fool. \"What a charming man! What a pity that he should have made such a deplorable marriage!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, so strong an element of hypocrisy is there in even the most sincere of men, who cast off, while they are talking to anyone, the opinion they actually hold of him and will express when he is no longer there, my family joined with M. Vinteuil in deploring Swann's marriage, invoking principles and conventions which (all the more because they invoked them in common with him, as though we were all thorough good fellows of the same sort) they appeared to suggest were in no way infringed at Montjouvain. M. Vinteuil did not send his daughter to visit Swann, an omission which Swann was the first to regret. For constantly, after meeting M. Vinteuil, he would remember that he had been meaning for a long time to ask him about some one of the same name as himself, one of his relatives, Swann supposed. And on this occasion he determined that he would not forget what he had to say to him when M. Vinteuil should appear with his daughter at Tansonville.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' was the shorter of the two that we used to take for our walks round Combray, and for that reason was reserved for days of uncertain weather, it followed that the climate of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise shewed an unduly high rainfall, and we would never lose sight of the fringe of Roussainville wood, so that we could, at any moment, run for shelter beneath its dense thatch of leaves.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often the sun would disappear behind a cloud, which impinged on its roundness, but whose edge the sun gilded in return. The brightness, though not the light of day, would then be shut off from a landscape in which all life appeared to be suspended, while the little village of Roussainville carved in relief upon the sky the white mass of its gables, with a startling precision of detail. A gust of wind blew from its perch a rook, which floated away and settled in the distance, while beneath a paling sky the woods on the horizon assumed a deeper tone of blue, as though they were painted in one of those cameos which you still find decorating the walls of old houses.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But on other days would begin to fall the rain, of which we had had due warning from the little barometer-figure which the spectacle-maker hung out in his doorway. Its drops, like migrating birds which fly off in a body at a given moment, would come down out of the sky in close marching order. They would never drift apart, would make no movement at random in their rapid course, but each one, keeping in its place, would draw after it the drop which was following, and the sky would be as greatly darkened as by the swallows flying south. We would take refuge among the trees. And when it seemed that their flight was accomplished, a few last drops, feebler and slower than the rest, would still come down. But we would emerge from our shelter, for the rain was playing a game, now, among the branches, and, even when it was almost dry again underfoot, a stray drop or two, lingering in the hollow of a leaf, would run down and hang glistening from the point of it until suddenly it splashed plump upon our upturned faces from the whole height of the tree.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often, too, we would hurry for shelter, tumbling in among all its stony saints and patriarchs, into the porch of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, How typically French that church was! Over its door the saints, the kings of chivalry with lilies in their hands, the wedding scenes and funerals were carved as they might have been in the mind of Fran\u00e7oise. The sculptor had also recorded certain anecdotes of Aristotle and Virgil, precisely as Fran\u00e7oise in her kitchen would break into speech about Saint Louis as though she herself had known him, generally in order to depreciate, by contrast with him, my grandparents, whom she considered less 'righteous.' One could see that the ideas which the mediaeval artist and the mediaeval peasant (who had survived to cook for us in the nineteenth century) had of classical and of early Christian history, ideas whose inaccuracy was atoned for by their honest simplicity, were derived not from books, but from a tradition at once ancient and direct, unbroken, oral, degraded, unrecognisable, and alive. Another Combray person whom I could discern also, potential and typified, in the gothic sculptures of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs was young Th\u00e9odore, the assistant in Camus's shop. And, indeed, Fran\u00e7oise herself was well aware that she had in him a countryman and contemporary, for when my aunt was too ill for Fran\u00e7oise to be able, unaided, to lift her in her bed or to carry her to her chair, rather than let the kitchen-maid come upstairs and, perhaps, 'make an impression' on my aunt, she would send out for Th\u00e9odore. And this lad, who was regarded, and quite rightly, in the town as a 'bad character,' was so abounding in that spirit which had served to decorate the porch of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, and particularly in the feelings of respect due, in Fran\u00e7oise eyes, to all 'poor invalids,' and, above all, to her own 'poor mistress,' that he had, when he bent down to raise my aunt's head from her pillow, the same air of pr\u00e9rapha\u00e9lite simplicity and zeal which the little angels in the bas-reliefs wear, who throng, with tapers in their hands, about the deathbed of Our Lady, as though those carved faces of stone, naked and grey like trees in winter, were, like them, asleep only, storing up life and waiting to flower again in countless plebeian faces, reverend and cunning as the face of Th\u00e9odore, and glowing with the ruddy brilliance of ripe apples.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There, too, not fastened to the wall like the little angels, but detached from the porch, of more than human stature, erect upon her pedestal as upon a footstool, which had been placed there to save her feet from contact with the wet ground, stood a saint with the full cheeks, the firm breasts which swelled out inside her draperies like a cluster of ripe grapes inside a bag, the narrow forehead, short and stubborn nose, deep-set eyes, and strong, thick-skinned, courageous expression of the country-women of those parts. This similarity, which imparted to the statue itself a kindliness that I had not looked to find in it, was corroborated often by the arrival of some girl from the fields, come, like ourselves, for shelter beneath the porch, whose presence there\u2014as when the leaves of a climbing plant have grown up beside leaves carved in stone\u2014seemed intended by fate to allow us, by confronting it with its type in nature, to form a critical estimate of the truth of the work of art. Before our eyes, in the distance, a promised or an accursed land, Roussainville, within whose walls I had never penetrated, Roussainville was now, when the rain had ceased for us, still being chastised, like a village in the Old Testament, by all the innumerable spears and arrows of the storm, which beat down obliquely upon the dwellings of its inhabitants, or else had already received the forgiveness of the Almighty, Who had restored to it the light of His sun, which fell upon it in rays of uneven length, like the rays of a monstrance upon an altar.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, when the weather had completely broken, we were obliged to go home and to remain shut up indoors. Here and there, in the distance, in a landscape which, what with the failing light and saturated atmosphere, resembled a seascape rather, a few solitary houses clinging to the lower slopes of a hill whose heights were buried in a cloudy darkness shone out like little boats which had folded their sails and would ride at anchor, all night, upon the sea. But what mattered rain or storm? In summer, bad weather is no more than a passing fit of superficial ill-temper expressed by the permanent, underlying fine weather; a very different thing from the fluid and unstable 'fine weather' of winter, its very opposite, in fact; for has it not (firmly established in the soil, on which it has taken solid form in dense masses of foliage over which the rain may pour in torrents without weakening the resistance offered by their real and lasting happiness) hoisted, to keep them flying throughout the season, in the village streets, on the walls of the houses and in their gardens, its silken banners, violet and white. Sitting in the little parlour, where I would pass the time until dinner with a book, I might hear the water dripping from our chestnut-trees, but I would know that the shower would only glaze and brighten the greenness of their thick, crumpled leaves, and that they themselves had undertaken to remain there, like pledges of summer, all through the rainy night, to assure me of the fine weather's continuing; it might rain as it pleased, but to-morrow, over the white fence of Tansonville, there would surge and flow, numerous as ever, a sea of little heart-shaped leaves; and without the least anxiety I could watch the poplar in the Rue des Perchamps praying for mercy, bowing in desperation before the storm; without the least anxiety I could hear, at the far end of the garden, the last peals of thunder growling among our lilac-trees.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the weather was bad all morning, my family would abandon the idea of a walk, and I would remain at home. But, later on, I formed the habit of going out by myself on such days, and walking towards M\u00e9s\u00e9glise-la-Vineuse, during that autumn when we had to come to Combray to settle the division of my aunt L\u00e9onie's estate; for she had died at last, leaving both parties among her neighbours triumphant in the fact of her demise\u2014those who had insisted that her mode of life was enfeebling and must ultimately kill her, and, equally, those who had always maintained that she suffered from some disease not imaginary, but organic, by the visible proof of which the most sceptical would be obliged to own themselves convinced, once she had succumbed to it; causing no intense grief to any save one of her survivors, but to that one a grief savage in its violence. During the long fortnight of my aunt's last illness Fran\u00e7oise never went out of her room for an instant, never took off her clothes, allowed no one else to do anything for my aunt, and did not leave her body until it was actually in its grave. Then, at last, we understood that the sort of terror in which Fran\u00e7oise had lived of my aunt's harsh words, her suspicions and her anger, had developed in her a sentiment which we had mistaken for hatred, and which was really veneration and love. Her true mistress, whose decisions it had been impossible to foresee, from whose stratagems it had been so hard to escape, of whose good nature it had been so easy to take advantage, her sovereign, her mysterious and omnipotent monarch was no more. Compared with such a mistress we counted for very little. The time had long passed when, on our first coming to spend our holidays at Combray, we had been of equal importance, in Fran\u00e7oise eyes, with my aunt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During that autumn my parents, finding the days so fully occupied with the legal formalities that had to be gone through, and discussions with solicitors and farmers, that they had little time for walks which, as it happened, the weather made precarious, began to let me go, without them, along the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way,' wrapped up in a huge Highland plaid which protected me from the rain, and which I was all the more ready to throw over my shoulders because I felt that the stripes of its gaudy tartan scandalised Fran\u00e7oise, whom it was impossible to convince that the colour of one's clothes had nothing whatever to do with one's mourning for the dead, and to whom the grief which we had shewn on my aunt's death was wholly unsatisfactory, since we had not entertained the neighbours to a great funeral banquet, and did not adopt a special tone when we spoke of her, while I at times might be heard humming a tune. I am sure that in a book\u2014and to that extent my feelings were closely akin to those of Fran\u00e7oise\u2014such a conception of mourning, in the manner of the Chanson de Roland and of the porch of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, would have seemed most attractive. But the moment that Fran\u00e7oise herself approached, some evil spirit would urge me to attempt to make her angry, and I would avail myself of the slightest pretext to say to her that I regretted my aunt's death because she had been a good woman in spite of her absurdities, but not in the least because she was my aunt; that she might easily have been my aunt and yet have been so odious that her death would not have caused me a moment's sorrow; statements which, in a book, would have struck me as merely fatuous.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if Fran\u00e7oise then, inspired like a poet with a flood of confused reflections upon bereavement, grief, and family memories, were to plead her inability to rebut my theories, saying: \"I don't know how to espress myself\"\u2014I would triumph over her with an ironical and brutal common sense worthy of Dr. Percepied; and if she went on: \"All the same she was a geological relation; there is always the respect due to your geology,\" I would shrug my shoulders and say: \"It is really very good of me to discuss the matter with an illiterate old woman who cannot speak her own language,\" adopting, to deliver judgment on Fran\u00e7oise, the mean and narrow outlook of the pedant, whom those who are most contemptuous of him in the impartiality of their own minds are only too prone to copy when they are obliged to play a part upon the vulgar stage of life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My walks, that autumn, were all the more delightful because I used to take them after long hours spent over a book. When I was tired of reading, after a whole morning in the house, I would throw my plaid across my shoulders and set out; my body, which in a long spell of enforced immobility had stored up an accumulation of vital energy, was now obliged, like a spinning-top wound and let go, to spend this in every direction. The walls of houses, the Tansonville hedge, the trees of Roussainville wood, the bushes against which Montjouvain leaned its back, all must bear the blows of my walking-stick or umbrella, must hear my shouts of happiness, blows and shouts being indeed no more than expressions of the confused ideas which exhilarated me, and which, not being developed to the point at which they might rest exposed to the light of day, rather than submit to a slow and difficult course of elucidation, found it easier and more pleasant to drift into an immediate outlet. And so it is that the bulk of what appear to be the emotional renderings of our inmost sensations do no more than relieve us of the burden of those sensations by allowing them to escape from us in an indistinct form which does not teach us how it should be interpreted. When I attempt to reckon up all that I owe to the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way,' all the humble discoveries of which it was either the accidental setting or the direct inspiration and cause, I am reminded that it was in that same autumn, on one of those walks, near the bushy precipice which guarded Montjouvain from the rear, that I was struck for the first time by this lack of harmony between our impressions and their normal forms of expression. After an hour of rain and wind, against which I had put up a brisk fight, as I came to the edge of the Montjouvain pond, and reached a little hut, roofed with tiles, in which M. Vinteuil's gardener kept his tools, the sun shone out again, and its golden rays, washed clean by the shower, blazed once more in the sky, on the trees, on the wall of the hut, and on the still wet tiles of the roof, which had a chicken perching upon its ridge. The wind pulled out sideways the wild grass that grew in the wall, and the chicken's downy feathers, both of which things let themselves float upon the wind's breath to their full extent, with the unresisting submissiveness of light and lifeless matter. The tiled roof cast upon the pond, whose reflections were now clear again in the sunlight, a square of pink marble, the like of which I had never observed before. And, seeing upon the water, where it reflected the wall, a pallid smile responding to the smiling sky, I cried aloud in my enthusiasm, brandishing my furled umbrella: \"Damn, damn, damn, damn!\" But at the same time I felt that I was in duty bound not to content myself with these unilluminating words, but to endeavour to see more clearly into the sources of my enjoyment.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it was at that moment, too\u2014thanks to a peasant who went past, apparently in a bad enough humour already, but more so when he nearly received my umbrella in his face, and who replied without any cordiality to my \"Fine day, what! good to be out walking!\"\u2014that I learned that identical emotions do not spring up in the hearts of all men simultaneously, by a pre-established order. Later on I discovered that, whenever I had read for too long and was in a mood for conversation, the friend to whom I would be burning to say something would at that moment have finished indulging himself in the delights of conversation, and wanted nothing now but to be left to read undisturbed. And if I had been thinking with affection of my parents, and forming the most sensible and proper plans for giving them pleasure, they would have been using the same interval of time to discover some misdeed that I had already forgotten, and would begin to scold me severely, just as I flung myself upon them with a kiss.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes to the exhilaration which I derived from being alone would be added an alternative feeling, so that I could not be clear in my mind to which I should give the casting vote; a feeling stimulated by the desire to see rise up before my eyes a peasant-girl whom I might clasp in my arms. Coming abruptly, and without giving me time to trace it accurately to its source among so many ideas of a very different kind, the pleasure which accompanied this desire seemed only a degree superior to what was given me by my other thoughts. I found an additional merit in everything that was in my mind at the moment, in the pink reflection of the tiled roof, the wild grass in the wall, the village of Roussainville into which I had long desired to penetrate, the trees of its wood and the steeple of its church, created in them by this fresh emotion which made them appear more desirable only because I thought it was they that had provoked it, and which seemed only to wish to bear me more swiftly towards them when it filled my sails with a potent, unknown, and propitious breeze. But if this desire that a woman should appear added for me something more exalting than the charms of nature, they in their turn enlarged what I might, in the woman's charm, have found too much restricted. It seemed to me that the beauty of the trees was hers also, and that, as for the spirit of those horizons, of the village of Roussainville, of the books which I was reading that year, it was her kiss which would make me master of them all; and, my imagination drawing strength from contact with my sensuality, my sensuality expanding through all the realms of my imagination, my desire had no longer any bounds. Moreover\u2014just as in moments of musing contemplation of nature, the normal actions of the mind being suspended, and our abstract ideas of things set on one side, we believe with the profoundest faith in the originality, in the individual existence of the place in which we may happen to be\u2014the passing figure which my desire evoked seemed to be not any one example of the general type of 'woman,' but a necessary and natural product of the soil. For at that time everything which was not myself, the earth and the creatures upon it, seemed to me more precious, more important, endowed with a more real existence than they appear to full-grown men. And between the earth and its creatures I made no distinction. I had a desire for a peasant-girl from M\u00e9s\u00e9glise or Roussainville, for a fisher-girl from Balbec, just as I had a desire for Balbec and M\u00e9s\u00e9glise. The pleasure which those girls were empowered to give me would have seemed less genuine, I should have had no faith in it any longer, if I had been at liberty to modify its conditions as I chose. To meet in Paris a fisher-girl from Balbec or a peasant-girl from M\u00e9s\u00e9glise would have been like receiving the present of a shell which I had never seen upon the beach, or of a fern which I had never found among the woods, would have stripped from the pleasure which she was about to give me all those other pleasures in the thick of which my imagination had enwrapped her. But to wander thus among the woods of Roussainville without a peasant-girl to embrace was to see those woods and yet know nothing of their secret treasure, their deep-hidden beauty. That girl whom I never saw save dappled with the shadows of their leaves, was to me herself a plant of local growth, only taller than the rest, and one whose structure would enable me to approach more closely than in them to the intimate savour of the land from which she had sprung. I could believe this all the more readily (and also that the caresses by which she would bring that savour to my senses were themselves of a particular kind, yielding a pleasure which I could never derive from any but herself) since I was still, and must for long remain, in that period of life when one has not yet separated the fact of this sensual pleasure from the various women in whose company one has tasted it, when one has not reduced it to a general idea which makes one regard them thenceforward as the variable instruments of a pleasure that is always the same. Indeed, that pleasure does not exist, isolated and formulated in the consciousness, as the ultimate object with which one seeks a woman's company, or as the cause of the uneasiness which, in anticipation, one then feels. Hardly even does one think of oneself, but only how to escape from oneself. Obscurely awaited, immanent and concealed, it rouses to such a paroxysm, at the moment when at last it makes itself felt, those other pleasures which we find in the tender glance, in the kiss of her who is by our side, that it seems to us, more than anything else, a sort of transport of gratitude for the kindness of heart of our companion and for her touching predilection of ourselves, which we measure by the benefits, by the happiness that she showers upon us.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas, it was in vain that I implored the dungeon-keep of Roussainville, that I begged it to send out to meet me some daughter of its village, appealing to it as to the sole confidant to whom I had disclosed my earliest desire when, from the top floor of our house at Combray, from the little room that smelt of orris-root, I had peered out and seen nothing but its tower, framed in the square of the half-opened window, while, with the heroic scruples of a traveller setting forth for unknown climes, or of a desperate wretch hesitating on the verge of self-destruction, faint with emotion, I explored, across the bounds of my own experience, an untrodden path which, I believed, might lead me to my death, even\u2014until passion spent itself and left me shuddering among the sprays of flowering currant which, creeping in through the window, tumbled all about my body. In vain I called upon it now. In vain I compressed the whole landscape into my field of vision, draining it with an exhaustive gaze which sought to extract from it a female creature. I might go alone as far as the porch of Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs: never did I find there the girl whom I should inevitably have met, had I been with my grandfather, and so unable to engage her in conversation. I would fix my eyes, without limit of time, upon the trunk of a distant tree, from behind which she must appear and spring towards me; my closest scrutiny left the horizon barren as before; night was falling; without any hope now would I concentrate my attention, as though to force up out of it the creatures which it must conceal, upon that sterile soil, that stale and outworn land; and it was no longer in lightness of heart, but with sullen anger that I aimed blows at the trees of Roussainville wood, from among which no more living creatures made their appearance than if they had been trees painted on the stretched canvas background of a panorama, when, unable to resign myself to having to return home without having held in my arms the woman I so greatly desired, I was yet obliged to retrace my steps towards Combray, and to admit to myself that the chance of her appearing in my path grew smaller every moment. And if she had appeared, would I have dared to speak to her? I felt that she would have regarded me as mad, for I no longer thought of those desires which came to me on my walks, but were never realized, as being shared by others, or as having any existence apart from myself. They seemed nothing more now than the purely subjective, impotent, illusory creatures of my temperament. They were in no way connected now with nature, with the world of real things, which from now onwards lost all its charm and significance, and meant no more to my life than a purely conventional framework, just as the action of a novel is framed in the railway carriage, on a seat of which a traveller is reading it to pass the time.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it is perhaps from another impression which I received at Mont-jouvain, some years later, an impression which at that time was without meaning, that there arose, long afterwards, my idea of that cruel side of human passion called 'sadism.' We shall see, in due course, that for quite another reason the memory of this impression was to play an important part in my life. It was during a spell of very hot weather; my parents, who had been obliged to go away for the whole day, had told me that I might stay out as late as I pleased; and having gone as far as the Montjouvain pond, where I enjoyed seeing again the reflection of the tiled roof of the hut, I had lain down in the shade and gone to sleep among the bushes on the steep slope that rose up behind the house, just where I had waited for my parents, years before, one day when they had gone to call on M. Vinteuil. It was almost dark when I awoke, and I wished to rise and go away, but I saw Mile. Vinteuil (or thought, at least, that I recognised her, for I had not seen her often at Combray, and then only when she was still a child, whereas she was now growing into a young woman), who probably had just come in, standing in front of me, and only a few feet away from me, in that room in which her father had entertained mine, and which she had now made into a little sitting-room for herself. The window was partly open; the lamp was lighted; I could watch her every movement without her being able to see me; but, had I gone away, I must have made a rustling sound among the bushes, she would have heard me, and might have thought that I had been hiding there in order to spy upon her.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was in deep mourning, for her father had but lately died. We had not gone to see her; my mother had not cared to go, on account of that virtue which alone in her fixed any bounds to her benevolence\u2014namely, modesty; but she pitied the girl from the depths of her heart. My mother had not forgotten the sad end of M. Vinteuil's life, his complete absorption, first in having to play both mother and nursery-maid to his daughter, and, later, in the suffering which she had caused him; she could see the tortured expression which was never absent from the old man's face in those terrible last years; she knew that he had definitely abandoned the task of transcribing in fair copies the whole of his later work, the poor little pieces, we imagined, of an old music-master, a retired village organist, which, we assumed, were of little or no value in themselves, though we did not despise them, because they were of such great value to him and had been the chief motive of his life before he sacrificed them to his daughter; pieces which, being mostly not even written down, but recorded only in his memory, while the rest were scribbled on loose sheets of paper, and quite illegible, must now remain unknown for ever; my mother thought, also, of that other and still more cruel renunciation to which M. Vinteuil had been driven, that of seeing the girl happily settled, with an honest and respectable future; when she called to mind all this utter and crushing misery that had come upon my aunts' old music-master, she was moved to very real grief, and shuddered to think of that other grief, so different in its bitterness, which Mlle. Vinteuil must now be feeling, tinged with remorse at having virtually killed her father. \"Poor M. Vinteuil,\" my mother would say, \"he lived for his daughter, and now he has died for her, without getting his reward. Will he get it now, I wonder, and in what form? It can only come to him from her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the far end of Mlle. Vinteuil's sitting-room, on the mantelpiece, stood a small photograph of her father which she went briskly to fetch, just as the sound of carriage wheels was heard from the road outside, then flung herself down on a sofa and drew close beside her a little table on which she placed the photograph, just as, long ago, M. Vinteuil had 'placed' beside him the piece of music which he would have liked to play over to my parents. And then her friend came in. Mlle. Vinteuil greeted her without rising, clasping her hands behind her head, and drew her body to one side of the sofa, as though to 'make room.' But no sooner had she done this than she appeared to feel that she was perhaps suggesting a particular position to her friend, with an emphasis which might well be regarded as importunate. She thought that her friend would prefer, no doubt, to sit down at some distance from her, upon a chair; she felt that she had been indiscreet; her sensitive heart took fright; stretching herself out again over the whole of the sofa, she closed her eyes and began to yawn, so as to indicate that it was a desire to sleep, and that alone, which had made her lie down there. Despite the rude and hectoring familiarity with which she treated her companion I could recognise in her the obsequious and reticent advances, the abrupt scruples and restraints which had characterised her father. Presently she rose and came to the window, where she pretended to be trying to close the shutters and not succeeding.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Leave them open,\" said her friend. \"I am hot.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But it's too dreadful! People will see us,\" Mlle. Vinteuil answered. And then she guessed, probably, that her friend would think that she had uttered these words simply in order to provoke a reply in certain other words, which she seemed, indeed, to wish to hear spoken, but, from prudence, would let her friend be the first to speak. And so, although I could not see her face clearly enough, I am sure that the expression must have appeared on it which my grandmother had once found so delightful, when she hastily went on: \"When I say 'see us' I mean, of course, see us reading. It's so dreadful to think that in every trivial little thing you do some one may be overlooking you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the instinctive generosity of her nature, a courtesy beyond her control, she refrained from uttering the studied words which, she had felt, were indispensable for the full realisation of her desire. And perpetually, in the depths of her being, a shy and suppliant maiden would kneel before that other element, the old campaigner, battered but triumphant, would intercede with him and oblige him to retire.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, yes, it is so extremely likely that people are looking at us at this time of night in this densely populated district!\" said her friend, with bitter irony. \"And what if they are?\" she went on, feeling bound to annotate with a malicious yet affectionate wink these words which she was repeating, out of good nature, like a lesson prepared beforehand which, she knew, it would please Mlle. Vinteuil to hear. \"And what if they are? All the better that they should see us.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mlle. Vinteuil shuddered and rose to her feet. In her sensitive and scrupulous heart she was ignorant what words ought to flow, spontaneously, from her lips, so as to produce the scene for which her eager senses clamoured. She reached out as far as she could across the limitations of her true character to find the language appropriate to a vicious young woman such as she longed to be thought, but the words which, she imagined, such a young woman might have uttered with sincerity sounded unreal in her own mouth. And what little she allowed herself to say was said in a strained tone, in which her ingrained timidity paralysed her tendency to freedom and audacity of speech; while she kept on interrupting herself with: \"You're sure you aren't cold? You aren't too hot? You don't want to sit and read by yourself?...\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Your ladyship's thoughts seem to be rather 'warm' this evening,\" she concluded, doubtless repeating a phrase which she had heard used, on some earlier occasion, by her friend.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the V-shaped opening of her crape bodice Mlle. Vinteuil felt the sting of her friend's sudden kiss; she gave a little scream and ran away; and then they began to chase one another about the room, scrambling over the furniture, their wide sleeves fluttering like wings, clucking and crowing like a pair of amorous fowls. At last Mlle. Vinteuil fell down exhausted upon the sofa, where she was screened from me by the stooping body of her friend. But the latter now had her back turned to the little table on which the old music-master's portrait had been arranged. Mlle. Vinteuil realised that her friend would not see it unless her attention were drawn to it, and so exclaimed, as if she herself had just noticed it for the first time: \"Oh! there's my father's picture looking at us; I can't think who can have put it there; I'm sure I've told them twenty times, that is not the proper place for it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I remembered the words that M. Vinteuil had used to my parents in apologising for an obtrusive sheet of music. This photograph was, of course, in common use in their ritual observances, was subjected to daily profanation, for the friend replied in words which were evidently a liturgical response: \"Let him stay there. He can't trouble us any longer. D'you think he'd start whining, d'you think he'd pack you out of the house if he could see you now, with the window open, the ugly old monkey?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To which Mlle. Vinteuil replied, \"Oh, please!\"\u2014a gentle reproach which testified to the genuine goodness of her nature, not that it was prompted by any resentment at hearing her father spoken of in this fashion (for that was evidently a feeling which she had trained herself, by a long course of sophistries, to keep in close subjection at such moments), but rather because it was the bridle which, so as to avoid all appearance of egotism, she herself used to curb the gratification which her friend was attempting to procure for her. It may well have been, too, that the smiling moderation with which she faced and answered these blasphemies, that this tender and hypocritical rebuke appeared to her frank and generous nature as a particularly shameful and seductive form of that criminal attitude towards life which she was endeavouring to adopt. But she could not resist the attraction of being treated with affection by a woman who had just shewn herself so implacable towards the defenceless dead; she sprang on to the knees of her friend and held out a chaste brow to be kissed; precisely as a daughter would have done to her mother, feeling with exquisite joy that they would thus, between them, inflict the last turn of the screw of cruelty, in robbing M. Vinteuil, as though they were actually rifling his tomb, of the sacred rights of fatherhood. Her friend took the girl's head in her hands and placed a kiss on her brow with a docility prompted by the real affection she had for Mlle. Vinteuil, as well as by the desire to bring what distraction she could into the dull and melancholy life of an orphan.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Do you know what I should like to do to that old horror?\" she said, taking up the photograph. She murmured in Mlle. Vinteuil's ear something that I could not distinguish.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh! You would never dare.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Not dare to spit on it? On that?\" shouted the friend with deliberate brutality.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I heard no more, for Mlle. Vinteuil, who now seemed weary, awkward, preoccupied, sincere, and rather sad, came back to the window and drew the shutters close; but I knew now what was the reward that M. Vinteuil, in return for all the suffering that he had endured in his lifetime, on account of his daughter, had received from her after his death.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet I have since reflected that if M. Vinteuil had been able to be present at this scene, he might still, and in spite of everything, have continued to believe in his daughter's soundness of heart, and that he might even, in so doing, have been not altogether wrong. It was true that in all Mlle. Vinteuil's actions the appearance of evil was so strong and so consistent that it would have been hard to find it exhibited in such completeness save in what is nowadays called a 'sadist'; it is behind the footlights of a Paris theatre, and not under the homely lamp of an actual country house, that one expects to see a girl leading her friend on to spit upon the portrait of a father who has lived and died for nothing and no one but herself; and when we find in real life a desire for melodramatic effect, it is generally the 'sadic' instinct that is responsible for it. It is possible that, without being in the least inclined towards 'sadism,' a girl might have shewn the same outrageous cruelty as Mlle. Vinteuil in desecrating the memory and defying the wishes of her dead father, but she would not have given them deliberate expression in an act so crude in its symbolism, so lacking in subtlety; the criminal element in her behaviour would have been less evident to other people, and even to herself, since she would not have admitted to herself that she was doing wrong. But, appearances apart, in Mlle. Vinteuil's soul, at least in the earlier stages, the evil element was probably not unmixed. A 'sadist' of her kind is an artist in evil, which a wholly wicked person could not be, for in that case the evil would not have been external, it would have seemed quite natural to her, and would not even have been distinguishable from herself; and as for virtue, respect for the dead, filial obedience, since she would never have practised the cult of these things, she would take no impious delight in their profanation. 'Sadists' of Mlle. Vinteuil's sort are creatures so purely sentimental, so virtuous by nature, that even sensual pleasure appears to them as something bad, a privilege reserved for the wicked. And when they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it they endeavour to impersonate, to assume all the outward appearance of wicked people, for themselves and their partners in guilt, so as to gain the momentary illusion of having escaped beyond the control of their own gentle and scrupulous natures into the inhuman world of pleasure. And I could understand how she must have longed for such an escape when I realised that it was impossible for her to effect it. At the moment when she wished to be thought the very antithesis of her father, what she at once suggested to me were the mannerisms, in thought and speech, of the poor old music-master. Indeed, his photograph was nothing; what she really desecrated, what she corrupted into ministering to her pleasures, but what remained between them and her and prevented her from any direct enjoyment of them, was the likeness between her face and his, his mother's blue eyes which he had handed down to her, like some trinket to be kept in the family, those little friendly movements and inclinations which set up between the viciousness of Mlle. Vinteuil and herself a phraseology, a mentality not designed for vice, which made her regard it as not in any way different from the numberless little social duties and courtesies to which she must devote herself every day. It was not evil that gave her the idea of pleasure, that seemed to her attractive; it was pleasure, rather, that seemed evil. And as, every time that she indulged in it, pleasure came to her attended by evil thoughts such as, ordinarily, had no place in her virtuous mind, she came at length to see in pleasure itself something diabolical, to identify it with Evil. Perhaps Mlle. Vinteuil felt that at heart her friend was not altogether bad, not really sincere when she gave vent to those blasphemous utterances. At any rate, she had the pleasure of receiving those kisses on her brow, those smiles, those glances; all feigned, perhaps, but akin in their base and vicious mode of expression to those which would have been discernible on the face of a creature formed not out of kindness and long-suffering, but out of self-indulgence and cruelty. She was able to delude herself for a moment into believing that she was indeed amusing herself in the way in which, with so unnatural an accomplice, a girl might amuse herself who really did experience that savage antipathy towards her father's memory. Perhaps she would not have thought of wickedness as a state so rare, so abnormal, so exotic, one which it was so refreshing to visit, had she been able to distinguish in herself, as in all her fellow-men and women, that indifference to the sufferings which they cause which, whatever names else be given it, is the one true, terrible and lasting form of cruelty.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_______________________________________\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' was so easy, it was a very different matter when we took the 'Guermantes way,' for that meant a long walk, and we must make sure, first, of the weather. When we seemed to have entered upon a spell of fine days, when Fran\u00e7oise, in desperation that not a drop was falling upon the 'poor crops,' gazing up at the sky and seeing there only a little white cloud floating here and there upon its calm, azure surface, groaned aloud and exclaimed: \"You would say they were nothing more nor less than a lot of dogfish swimming about and sticking up their snouts! Ah, they never think of making it rain a little for the poor labourers! And then when the corn is all ripe, down it will come, rattling all over the place, and think no more of where it is falling than if it was on the sea!\"\u2014when my father's appeals to the gardener had met with the same encouraging answer several times in succession, then some one would say, at dinner: \"To-morrow, if the weather holds, we might go the Guermantes way.\" And off we would set, immediately after luncheon, through the little garden gate which dropped us into the Rue des Perchamps, narrow and bent at a sharp angle, dotted with grass-plots over which two or three wasps would spend the day botanising, a street as quaint as its name, from which its odd characteristics and its personality were, I felt, derived; a street for which one might search in vain through the Combray of to-day, for the public school now rises upon its site. But in my dreams of Combray (like those architects, pupils of Viollet-le-Duc, who, fancying that they can detect, beneath a Renaissance rood-loft and an eighteenth-century altar, traces of a Norman choir, restore the whole church to the state in which it probably was in the twelfth century) I leave not a stone of the modern edifice standing, I pierce through it and 'restore' the Rue des Perchamps. And for such reconstruction memory furnishes me with more detailed guidance than is generally at the disposal of restorers; the pictures which it has preserved\u2014perhaps the last surviving in the world to-day, and soon to follow the rest into oblivion\u2014of what Combray looked like in my childhood's days; pictures which, simply because it was the old Combray that traced their outlines upon my mind before it vanished, are as moving\u2014if I may compare a humble landscape with those glorious works, reproductions of which my grandmother was so fond of bestowing on me\u2014as those old engravings of the 'Cenacolo,' or that painting by Gentile Bellini, in which one sees, in a state in which they no longer exist, the masterpiece of Leonardo and the portico of Saint Mark's.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We would pass, in the Rue de l'Oiseau, before the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesch\u00e9, into whose great courtyard, once upon a time, would rumble the coaches of the Duchesses de Montpensier, de Guermantes, and de Montmorency, when they had to come down to Combray for some litigation with their farmers, or to receive homage from them. We would come at length to the Mall, among whose treetops I could distinguish the steeple of Saint-Hilaire. And I should have liked to be able to sit down and spend the whole day there, reading and listening to the bells, for it was so charming there and so quiet that, when an hour struck, you would have said not that it broke in upon the calm of the day, but that it relieved the day of its superfluity, and that the steeple, with the indolent, painstaking exactitude of a person who has nothing else to do, had simply, in order to squeeze out and let fall the few golden drops which had slowly and naturally accumulated in the hot sunlight, pressed, at a given moment, the distended surface of the silence.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The great charm of the 'Guermantes' way was that we had beside us, almost all the time, the course of the Vivonne. We crossed it first, ten minutes after leaving the house, by a foot-bridge called the Pont-Vieux. And every year, when we arrived at Combray, on Easter morning, after the sermon, if the weather was fine, I would run there to see (amid all the disorder that prevails on the morning of a great festival, the gorgeous preparations for which make the everyday household utensils that they have not contrived to banish seem more sordid than ever) the river flowing past, sky-blue already between banks still black and bare, its only companions a clump of daffodils, come out before their time, a few primroses, the first in flower, while here and there burned the blue flame of a violet, its stem bent beneath the weight of the drop of perfume stored in its tiny horn. The Pont-Vieux led to a tow-path which, at this point, would be overhung in summer by the bluish foliage of a hazel, under which a fisherman in a straw hat seemed to have taken root. At Combray, where I knew everyone, and could always detect the blacksmith or grocer's boy through his disguise of a beadle's uniform or chorister's surplice, this fisherman was the only person whom I was never able to identify. He must have known my family, for he used to raise his hat when we passed; and then I would always be just on the point of asking his name, when some one would make a sign to me to be quiet, or I would frighten the fish. We would follow the tow-path which ran along the top of a steep bank, several feet above the stream. The ground on the other side was lower, and stretched in a series of broad meadows as far as the village and even to the distant railway-station. Over these were strewn the remains, half-buried in the long grass, of the castle of the old Counts of Combray, who, during the Middle Ages, had had on this side the course of the Vivonne as a barrier and defence against attack from the Lords of Guermantes and Abbots of Martinville. Nothing was left now but a few stumps of towers, hummocks upon the broad surface of the fields, hardly visible, broken battlements over which, in their day, the bowmen had hurled down stones, the watchmen had gazed out over Novepont, Clairefontaine, Martinville-le-Sec, Bailleau-l'Exempt, fiefs all of them of Guermantes, a ring in which Combray was locked; but fallen among the grass now, levelled with the ground, climbed and commanded by boys from the Christian Brothers' school, who came there in their playtime, or with lesson-books to be conned; emblems of a past that had sunk down and well-nigh vanished under the earth, that lay by the water's edge now, like an idler taking the air, yet giving me strong food for thought, making the name of Combray connote to me not the little town of to-day only, but an historic city vastly different, seizing and holding my imagination by the remote, incomprehensible features which it half-concealed beneath a spangled veil of buttercups. For the buttercups grew past numbering on this spot which they had chosen for their games among the grass, standing singly, in couples, in whole companies, yellow as the yolk of eggs, and glowing with an added lustre, I felt, because, being powerless to consummate with my palate the pleasure which the sight of them never failed to give me, I would let it accumulate as my eyes ranged over their gilded expanse, until it had acquired the strength to create in my mind a fresh example of absolute, unproductive beauty; and so it had been from my earliest childhood, when from the tow-path I had stretched out my arms towards them, before even I could pronounce their charming name\u2014a name fit for the Prince in some French fairy-tale; colonists, perhaps, in some far distant century from Asia, but naturalised now for ever in the village, well satisfied with their modest horizon, rejoicing in the sunshine and the water's edge, faithful to their little glimpse of the railway-station; yet keeping, none the less, as do some of our old paintings, in their plebeian simplicity, a poetic scintillation from the golden East.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would amuse myself by watching the glass jars which the boys used to lower into the Vivonne, to catch minnows, and which, filled by the current of the stream, in which they themselves also were enclosed, at once 'containers' whose transparent sides were like solidified water and 'contents' plunged into a still larger container of liquid, flowing crystal, suggested an image of coolness more delicious and more provoking than the same water in the same jars would have done, standing upon a table laid for dinner, by shewing it as perpetually in flight between the impalpable water, in which my hands could not arrest it, and the insoluble glass, in which my palate could not enjoy it. I decided that I would come there again with a line and catch fish; I begged for and obtained a morsel of bread from our luncheon basket; and threw into the Vivonne pellets which had the power, it seemed, to bring about a chemical precipitation, for the water at once grew solid round about them in oval clusters of emaciated tadpoles, which until then it had, no doubt, been holding in solution, invisible, but ready and alert to enter the stage of crystallisation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently the course of the Vivonne became choked with water-plants. At first they appeared singly, a lily, for instance, which the current, across whose path it had unfortunately grown, would never leave at rest for a moment, so that, like a ferry-boat mechanically propelled, it would drift over to one bank only to return to the other, eternally repeating its double journey. Thrust towards the bank, its stalk would be straightened out, lengthened, strained almost to breaking-point until the current again caught it, its green moorings swung back over their anchorage and brought the unhappy plant to what might fitly be called its starting-point, since it was fated not to rest there a moment before moving off once again. I would still find it there, on one walk after another, always in the same helpless state, suggesting certain victims of neurasthenia, among whom my grandfather would have included my aunt L\u00e9onie, who present without modification, year after year, the spectacle of their odd and unaccountable habits, which they always imagine themselves to be on the point of shaking off, but which they always retain to the end; caught in the treadmill of their own maladies and eccentricities, their futile endeavours to escape serve only to actuate its mechanism, to keep in motion the clockwork of their strange, ineluctable, fatal daily round. Such as these was the water-lily, and also like one of those wretches whose peculiar torments, repeated indefinitely throughout eternity, aroused the curiosity of Dante, who would have inquired of them at greater length and in fuller detail from the victims themselves, had not Virgil, striding on ahead, obliged him to hasten after him at full speed, as I must hasten after my parents.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But farther on the current slackened, where the stream ran through a property thrown open to the public by its owner, who had made a hobby of aquatic gardening, so that the little ponds into which the Vivonne was here diverted were aflower with water-lilies. As the banks at this point were thickly wooded, the heavy shade of the trees gave the water a background which was ordinarily dark green, although sometimes, when we were coming home on a calm evening after a stormy afternoon, I have seen in its depths a clear, crude blue that was almost violet, suggesting a floor of Japanese cloisonn\u00e9. Here and there, on the surface, floated, blushing like a strawberry, the scarlet heart of a lily set in a ring of white petals.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beyond these the flowers were more frequent, but paler, less glossy, more thickly seeded, more tightly folded, and disposed, by accident, in festoons so graceful that I would fancy I saw floating upon the stream, as though after the dreary stripping of the decorations used in some Watteau festival, moss-roses in loosened garlands. Elsewhere a corner seemed to be reserved for the commoner kinds of lily; of a neat pink or white like rocket-flowers, washed clean like porcelain, with housewifely care; while, a little farther again, were others, pressed close together in a floating garden-bed, as though pansies had flown out of a garden like butterflies and were hovering with blue and burnished wings over the transparent shadowiness of this watery border; this skiey border also, for it set beneath the flowers a soil of a colour more precious, more moving than their own; and both in the afternoon, when it sparkled beneath the lilies in the kaleidoscope of a happiness silent, restless, and alert, and towards evening, when it was filled like a distant heaven with the roseate dreams of the setting sun, incessantly changing and ever remaining in harmony, about the more permanent colour of the flowers themselves, with the utmost profundity, evanescence, and mystery\u2014with a quiet suggestion of infinity; afternoon or evening, it seemed to have set them flowering in the heart of the sky.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After leaving this park the Vivonne began to flow again more swiftly. How often have I watched, and longed to imitate, when I should be free to live as I chose, a rower who had shipped his oars and lay stretched out on his back, his head down, in the bottom of his boat, letting it drift with the current, seeing nothing but the sky which slipped quietly above him, shewing upon his features a foretaste of happiness and peace\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We would sit down among the irises at the water's edge. In the holiday sky a lazy cloud streamed out to its full length. Now and then, crushed by the burden of idleness, a carp would heave up out of the water, with an anxious gasp. It was time for us to feed. Before starting homewards we would sit for a long time there, eating fruit and bread and chocolate, on the grass, over which came to our ears, horizontal, faint, but solid still and metallic, the sound of the bells of Saint-Hilaire, which had melted not at all in the atmosphere it was so well accustomed to traverse, but, broken piecemeal by the successive palpitation of all their sonorous strokes, throbbed as it brushed the flowers at our feet.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, at the water's edge and embedded in trees, we would come upon a house of the kind called 'pleasure houses,' isolated and lost, seeing nothing of the world, save the river which bathed its feet. A young woman, whose pensive face and fashionable veils did not suggest a local origin, and who had doubtless come there, in the popular phrase, 'to bury herself,' to taste the bitter sweetness of feeling that her name, and still more the name of him whose heart she had once held, but had been unable to keep, were unknown there, stood framed in a window from which she had no outlook beyond the boat that was moored beside her door. She raised her eyes with an air of distraction when she heard, through the trees that lined the bank, the voices of passers-by of whom, before they came in sight, she might be certain that never had they known, nor would they know, the faithless lover, that nothing in their past lives bore his imprint, which nothing in their future would have occasion to receive. One felt that in her renunciation of life she had willingly abandoned those places in which she would at least have been able to see him whom she loved, for others where he had never trod. And I watched her, as she returned from some walk along a road where she had known that he would not appear, drawing from her submissive fingers long gloves of a precious, useless charm.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Never, in the course of our walks along the 'Guermantes way,' might we penetrate as far as the source of the Vivonne, of which I had often thought, which had in my mind so abstract, so ideal an existence, that I had been as much surprised when some one told me that it was actually to be found in the same department, and at a given number of miles from Combray, as I had been on the day when I had learned that there was another fixed point somewhere on the earth's surface, where, according to the ancients, opened the jaws of Hell. Nor could we ever reach that other goal, to which I longed so much to attain, Guermantes itself. I knew that it was the residence of its proprietors, the Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes, I knew that they were real personages who did actually exist, but whenever I thought about them I pictured them to myself either in tapestry, as was the 'Coronation of Esther' which hung in our church, or else in changing, rainbow colours, as was Gilbert the Bad in his window, where he passed from cabbage green, when I was dipping my fingers in the holy water stoup, to plum blue when I had reached our row of chairs, or again altogether impalpable, like the image of Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant, ancestress of the Guermantes family, which the magic lantern sent wandering over the curtains of my room or flung aloft upon the ceiling\u2014in short, always wrapped in the mystery of the Merovingian age, and bathed, as in a sunset, in the orange light which glowed from the resounding syllable 'antes.' And if, in spite of that, they were for me, in their capacity as a duke and a duchess, real people, though of an unfamiliar kind, this ducal personality was in its turn enormously distended, immaterialised, so as to encircle and contain that Guermantes of which they were duke and duchess, all that sunlit 'Guermantes way' of our walks, the course of the Vivonne, its water-lilies and its overshadowing trees, and an endless series of hot summer afternoons. And I knew that they bore not only the titles of Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes, but that since the fourteenth century, when, after vain attempts to conquer its earlier lords in battle, they had allied themselves by marriage, and so became Counts of Combray, the first citizens, consequently, of the place, and yet the only ones among its citizens who did not reside in it\u2014Comtes de Combray, possessing Combray, threading it on their string of names and titles, absorbing it in their personalities, and illustrating, no doubt, in themselves that strange and pious melancholy which was peculiar to Combray; proprietors of the town, though not of any particular house there; dwelling, presumably, out of doors, in the street, between heaven and earth, like that Gilbert de Guermantes, of whom I could see, in the stained glass of the apse of Saint-Hilaire, only the 'other side' in dull black lacquer, if I raised my eyes to look for him, when I was going to Camus's for a packet of salt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then it happened that, going the 'Guermantes way,' I passed occasionally by a row of well-watered little gardens, over whose hedges rose clusters of dark blossom. I would stop before them, hoping to gain some precious addition to my experience, for I seemed to have before my eyes a fragment of that riverside country which I had longed so much to see and know since coming upon a description of it by one of my favourite authors. And it was with that story-book land, with its imagined soil intersected by a hundred bubbling watercourses, that Guermantes, changing its form in my mind, became identified, after I heard Dr. Percepied speak of the flowers and the charming rivulets and fountains that were to be seen there in the ducal park. I used to dream that Mme. de Guermantes, taking a sudden capricious fancy for myself, invited me there, that all day long she stood fishing for trout by my side. And when evening came, holding my hand in her own, as we passed by the little gardens of her vassals, she would point out to me the flowers that leaned their red and purple spikes along the tops of the low walls, and would teach me all their names. She would make me tell her, too, all about the poems that I meant to compose. And these dreams reminded me that, since I wished, some day, to become a writer, it was high time to decide what sort of books I was going to write. But as soon as I asked myself the question, and tried to discover some subjects to which I could impart a philosophical significance of infinite value, my mind would stop like a clock, I would see before me vacuity, nothing, would feel either that I was wholly devoid of talent, or that, perhaps, a malady of the brain was hindering its development. Sometimes I would depend upon my father's arranging everything for me. He was so powerful, in such favour with the people who 'really counted,' that he made it possible for us to transgress laws which Fran\u00e7oise had taught me to regard as more ineluctable than the laws of life and death, as when we were allowed to postpone for a year the compulsory repainting of the walls of our house, alone among all the houses in that part of Paris, or when he obtained permission from the Minister for Mme. Sazerat's son, who had been ordered to some watering-place, to take his degree two months before the proper time, among the candidates whose surnames began with 'A,' instead of having to wait his turn as an 'S.' If I had fallen seriously ill, if I had been captured by brigands, convinced that my father's understanding with the supreme powers was too complete, that his letters of introduction to the Almighty were too irresistible for my illness or captivity to turn out anything but vain illusions, in which there was no danger actually threatening me, I should have awaited with perfect composure the inevitable hour of my return to comfortable realities, of my deliverance from bondage or restoration to health. Perhaps this want of talent, this black cavity which gaped in my mind when I ransacked it for the theme of my future writings, was itself no more, either, than an unsubstantial illusion, and would be brought to an end by the intervention of my father, who would arrange with the Government and with Providence that I should be the first writer of my day. But at other times, while my parents were growing impatient at seeing me loiter behind instead of following them, my actual life, instead of seeming an artificial creation by my father, and one which he could modify as he chose, appeared, on the contrary, to be comprised in a larger reality which had not been created for my benefit, from whose judgments there was no appeal, in the heart of which I was bound, helpless, without friend or ally, and beyond which no further possibilities lay concealed. It was evident to me then that I existed in the same manner as all other men, that I must grow old, that I must die like them, and that among them I was to be distinguished merely as one of those who have no aptitude for writing. And so, utterly despondent, I renounced literature for ever, despite the encouragements that had been given me by Bloch. This intimate, spontaneous feeling, this sense of the nullity of my intellect, prevailed against all the flattering speeches that might be lavished upon me, as a wicked man, when everyone is loud in the praise of his good deeds, is gnawed by the secret remorse of conscience.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day my mother said: \"You are always talking about Mme. de Guermantes. Well, Dr. Percepied did a great deal for her when she was ill, four years ago, and so she is coming to Combray for his daughter's wedding. You will be able to see her in church.\" It was from Dr. Percepied, as it happened, that I had heard most about Mme. de Guermantes, and he had even shewn us the number of an illustrated paper in which she was depicted in the costume which she had worn at a fancy dress ball given by the Princesse de L\u00e9on.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly, during the nuptial mass, the beadle, by moving to one side, enabled me to see, sitting in a chapel, a lady with fair hair and a large nose, piercing blue eyes, a billowy scarf of mauve silk, glossy and new and brilliant, and a little spot at the corner of her nose. And because on the surface of her face, which was red, as though she had been very warm, I could make out, diluted and barely perceptible, details which resembled the portrait that had been shewn to me; because, more especially, the particular features which I remarked in this lady, if I attempted to catalogue them, formulated themselves in precisely the same terms:\u2014a large nose, blue eyes, as Dr. Percepied had used when describing in my presence the Duchesse de Guermantes, I said to myself: \"This lady is like the Duchesse de Guermantes.\" Now the chapel from which she was following the service was that of Gilbert the Bad; beneath its flat tombstones, yellowed and bulging like cells of honey in a comb, rested the bones of the old Counts of Brabant; and I remembered having heard it said that this chapel was reserved for the Guermantes family, whenever any of its members came to attend a ceremony at Combray; there was, indeed, but one woman resembling the portrait of Mme. de Guermantes who on that day, the very day on which she was expected to come there, could be sitting in that chapel: it was she! My disappointment was immense. It arose from my not having borne in mind, when I thought of Mme. de Guermantes, that I was picturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a painted window, as living in another century, as being of another substance than the rest of the human race. Never had I taken into account that she might have a red face, a mauve scarf like Mme. Sazerat; and the oval curve of her cheeks reminded me so strongly of people whom I had seen at home that the suspicion brushed against my mind (though it was immediately banished) that this lady in her creative principle, in the molecules of her physical composition, was perhaps not substantially the Duchesse de Guermantes, but that her body, in ignorance of the name that people had given it, belonged to a certain type of femininity which included, also, the wives of doctors and tradesmen. \"It is, it must be Mme. de Guermantes, and no one else!\" were the words underlying the attentive and astonished expression with which I was gazing upon this image, which, naturally enough, bore no resemblance to those that had so often, under the same title of 'Mme. de Guermantes,' appeared to me in dreams, since this one had not been, like the others, formed arbitrarily by myself, but had sprung into sight for the first time, only a moment ago, here in church; an image which was not of the same nature, was not colourable at will, like those others that allowed themselves to imbibe the orange tint of a sonorous syllable, but which was so real that everything, even to the fiery little spot at the corner of her nose, gave an assurance of her subjection to the laws of life, as in a transformation scene on the stage a crease in the dress of a fairy, a quivering of her tiny finger, indicate the material presence of a living actress before our eyes, whereas we were uncertain, till then, whether we were not looking merely at a projection of limelight from a lantern.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile I was endeavouring to apply to this image, which the prominent nose, the piercing eyes pinned down and fixed in my field of vision (perhaps because it was they that had first struck it, that had made the first impression on its surface, before I had had time to wonder whether the woman who thus appeared before me might possibly be Mme. de Guermantes), to this fresh and unchanging image the idea: \"It is Mme. de Guermantes\"; but I succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and the image, as though they were two discs moving in separate planes, with a space between. But this Mme. de Guermantes of whom I had so often dreamed, now that I could see that she had a real existence independent of myself, acquired a fresh increase of power over my imagination, which, paralysed for a moment by contact with a reality so different from anything that it had expected, began to react and to say within me: \"Great and glorious before the days of Charlemagne, the Guermantes had the right of life and death over their vassals; the Duchesse de Guermantes descends from Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant. She does not know, nor would she consent to know, any of the people who are here to-day.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then\u2014oh, marvellous independence of the human gaze, tied to the human face by a cord so loose, so long, so elastic that it can stray, alone, as far as it may choose\u2014while Mme. de Guermantes sat in the chapel above the tombs of her dead ancestors, her gaze lingered here and wandered there, rose to the capitals of the pillars, and even rested upon myself, like a ray of sunlight straying down the nave, but a ray of sunlight which, at the moment when I received its caress, appeared conscious of where it fell. As for Mme. de Guermantes herself, since she remained there motionless, sitting like a mother who affects not to notice the rude or awkward conduct of her children who, in the course of their play, are speaking to people whom she does not know, it was impossible for me to determine whether she approved or condemned the vagrancy of her eyes in the careless detachment of her heart.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt it to be important that she should not leave the church before I had been able to look long enough upon her, reminding myself that for years past I had regarded the sight of her as a thing eminently to be desired, and I kept my eyes fixed on her, as though by gazing at her I should be able to carry away and incorporate, to store up, for later reference, in myself the memory of that prominent nose, those red cheeks, of all those details which struck me as so much precious, authentic, unparalleled information with regard to her face. And now that, whenever I brought my mind to bear upon that face\u2014and especially, perhaps, in my determination, that form of the instinct of self-preservation with which we guard everything that is best in ourselves, not to admit that I had been in any way deceived\u2014I found only beauty there; setting her once again (since they were one and the same person, this lady who sat before me and that Duchesse de Guermantes whom, until then, I had been used to conjure into an imagined shape) apart from and above that common run of humanity with which the sight, pure and simple, of her in the flesh had made me for a moment confound her, I grew indignant when I heard people saying, in the congregation round me: \"She is better looking than Mme. Sazerat\" or \"than Mlle. Vinteuil,\" as though she had been in any way comparable with them. And my gaze resting upon her fair hair, her blue eyes, the lines of her neck, and overlooking the features which might have reminded me of the faces of other women, I cried out within myself, as I admired this deliberately unfinished sketch: \"How lovely she is! What true nobility! it is indeed a proud Guermantes, the descendant of Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant, that I have before me!\" And the care which I took to focus all my attention upon her face succeeded in isolating it so completely that to-day, when I call that marriage ceremony to mind, I find it impossible to visualise any single person who was present except her, and the beadle who answered me in the affirmative when I inquired whether the lady was, indeed, Mme. de Guermantes. But her, I can see her still quite clearly, especially at the moment when the procession filed into the sacristy, lighted by the intermittent, hot sunshine of a windy and rainy day, where Mme. de Guermantes found herself in the midst of all those Combray people whose names, even, she did not know, but whose inferiority proclaimed her own supremacy so loud that she must, in return, feel for them a genuine, pitying sympathy, and whom she might count on impressing even more forcibly by virtue of her simplicity and natural charm. And then, too, since she could not bring into play the deliberate glances, charged with a definite meaning, which one directs, in a crowd, towards people whom one knows, but must allow her vague thoughts to escape continually from her eyes in a flood of blue light which she was powerless to control, she was anxious not to distress in any way, not to seem to be despising those humbler mortals over whom that current flowed, by whom it was everywhere arrested. I can see again to-day, above her mauve scarf, silky and buoyant, the gentle astonishment in her eyes, to which she had added, without daring to address it to anyone in particular, but so that everyone might enjoy his share of it, the almost timid smile of a sovereign lady who seems to be making an apology for her presence among the vassals whom she loves. This smile rested upon myself, who had never ceased to follow her with my eyes. And I, remembering the glance which she had let fall upon me during the service, blue as a ray of sunlight that had penetrated the window of Gilbert the Bad, said to myself, \"Of course, she is thinking about me.\" I fancied that I had found favour in her sight, that she would continue to think of me after she had left the church, and would, perhaps, grow pensive again, that evening, at Guermantes, on my account. And at once I fell in love with her, for if it is sometimes enough to make us love a woman that she looks on us with contempt, as I supposed Mlle. Swann to have done, while we imagine that she cannot ever be ours, it is enough, also, sometimes that she looks on us kindly, as Mme. de Guermantes did then, while we think of her as almost ours already. Her eyes waxed blue as a periwinkle flower, wholly beyond my reach, yet dedicated by her to me; and the sun, bursting out again from behind a threatening cloud and darting the full force of its rays on to the Square and into the sacristy, shed a geranium glow over the red carpet laid down for the wedding, along which Mme. de Guermantes smilingly advanced, and covered its woollen texture with a nap of rosy velvet, a bloom of light, giving it that sort of tenderness, of solemn sweetness in the pomp of a joyful celebration, which characterises certain pages of Lohengrin, certain paintings by Carpaccio, and makes us understand how Baudelaire was able to apply to the sound of the trumpet the epithet 'delicious.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How often, after that day, in the course of my walks along the 'Guermantes way,' and with what an intensified melancholy did I reflect on my lack of qualification for a literary career, and that I must abandon all hope of ever becoming a famous author. The regret that I felt for this, while I lingered alone to dream for a little by myself, made me suffer so acutely that, in order not to feel it, my mind of its own accord, by a sort of inhibition in the instant of pain, ceased entirely to think of verse-making, of fiction, of the poetic future on which my want of talent precluded me from counting. Then, quite apart from all those literary preoccupations, and without definite attachment to anything, suddenly a roof, a gleam of sunlight reflected from a stone, the smell of a road would make me stop still, to enjoy the special pleasure that each of them gave me, and also because they appeared to be concealing, beneath what my eyes could see, something which they invited me to approach and seize from them, but which, despite all my efforts, I never managed to discover. As I felt that the mysterious object was to be found in them, I would stand there in front of them, motionless, gazing, breathing, endeavouring to penetrate with my mind beyond the thing seen or smelt. And if I had then to hasten after my grandfather, to proceed on my way, I would still seek to recover my sense of them by closing my eyes; I would concentrate upon recalling exactly the line of the roof, the colour of the stone, which, without my being able to understand why, had seemed to me to be teeming, ready to open, to yield up to me the secret treasure of which they were themselves no more than the outer coverings. It was certainly not any impression of this kind that could or would restore the hope I had lost of succeeding one day in becoming an author and poet, for each of them was associated with some material object devoid of any intellectual value, and suggesting no abstract truth. But at least they gave me an unreasoning pleasure, the illusion of a sort of fecundity of mind; and in that way distracted me from the tedium, from the sense of my own impotence which I had felt whenever I had sought a philosophic theme for some great literary work. So urgent was the task imposed on my conscience by these impressions of form or perfume or colour\u2014to strive for a perception of what lay hidden beneath them, that I was never long in seeking an excuse which would allow me to relax so strenuous an effort and to spare myself the fatigue that it involved. As good luck would have it, my parents called me; I felt that I had not, for the moment, the calm environment necessary for a successful pursuit of my researches, and that it would be better to think no more of the matter until I reached home, and not to exhaust myself in the meantime to no purpose. And so I concerned myself no longer with the mystery that lay hidden in a form or a perfume, quite at ease in my mind, since I was taking it home with me, protected by its visible and tangible covering, beneath which I should find it still alive, like the fish which, on days when I had been allowed to go out fishing, I used to carry back in my basket, buried in a couch of grass which kept them cool and fresh. Once in the house again I would begin to think of something else, and so my mind would become littered (as my room was with the flowers that I had gathered on my walks, or the odds and ends that people had given me) with a stone from the surface of which the sunlight was reflected, a roof, the sound of a bell, the smell of fallen leaves, a confused mass of different images, under which must have perished long ago the reality of which I used to have some foreboding, but which I never had the energy to discover and bring to light. Once, however, when we had prolonged our walk far beyond its ordinary limits, and so had been very glad to encounter, half way home, as afternoon darkened into evening, Dr. Percepied, who drove past us at full speed in his carriage, saw and recognised us, stopped, and made us jump in beside him, I received an impression of this sort which I did not abandon without having first subjected it to an examination a little more thorough. I had been set on the box beside the coachman, we were going like the wind because the Doctor had still, before returning to Combray, to call at Martinville-le-Sec, at the house of a patient, at whose door he asked us to wait for him. At a bend in the road I experienced, suddenly, that special pleasure, which bore no resemblance to any other, when I caught sight of the twin steeples of Martinville, on which the setting sun was playing, while the movement of the carriage and the windings of the road seemed to keep them continually changing their position; and then of a third steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, which, although separated from them by a hill and a valley, and rising from rather higher ground in the distance, appeared none the less to be standing by their side.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In ascertaining and noting the shape of their spires, the changes of aspect, the sunny warmth of their surfaces, I felt that I was not penetrating to the full depth of my impression, that something more lay behind that mobility, that luminosity, something which they seemed at once to contain and to conceal.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The steeples appeared so distant, and we ourselves seemed to come so little nearer them, that I was astonished when, a few minutes later, we drew up outside the church of Martinville. I did not know the reason for the pleasure which I had found in seeing them upon the horizon, and the business of trying to find out what that reason was seemed to me irksome; I wished only to keep in reserve in my brain those converging lines, moving in the sunshine, and, for the time being, to think of them no more. And it is probable that, had I done so, those two steeples would have vanished for ever, in a great medley of trees and roofs and scents and sounds which I had noticed and set apart on account of the obscure sense of pleasure which they gave me, but without ever exploring them more fully. I got down from the box to talk to my parents while we were waiting for the Doctor to reappear. Then it was time to start; I climbed up again to my place, turning my head to look back, once more, at my steeples, of which, a little later, I caught a farewell glimpse at a turn in the road. The coachman, who seemed little inclined for conversation, having barely acknowledged my remarks, I was obliged, in default of other society, to fall back on my own, and to attempt to recapture the vision of my steeples. And presently their outlines and their sunlit surface, as though they had been a sort of rind, were stripped apart; a little of what they had concealed from me became apparent; an idea came into my mind which had not existed for me a moment earlier, framed itself in words in my head; and the pleasure with which the first sight of them, just now, had filled me was so much enhanced that, overpowered by a sort of intoxication, I could no longer think of anything but them. At this point, although we had now travelled a long way from Martinville, I turned my head and caught sight of them again, quite black this time, for the sun had meanwhile set. Every few minutes a turn in the road would sweep them out of sight; then they shewed themselves for the last time, and so I saw them no more.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without admitting to myself that what lay buried within the steeples of Martinville must be something analogous to a charming phrase, since it was in the form of words which gave me pleasure that it had appeared to me, I borrowed a pencil and some paper from the Doctor, and composed, in spite of the jolting of the carriage, to appease my conscience and to satisfy my enthusiasm, the following little fragment, which I have since discovered, and now reproduce, with only a slight revision here and there.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_______________________________________\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alone, rising from the level of the plain, and seemingly lost in that expanse of open country, climbed to the sky the twin steeples of Martinville. Presently we saw three: springing into position confronting them by a daring volt, a third, a dilatory steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, was come to join them. The minutes passed, we were moving rapidly, and yet the three steeples were always a long way ahead of us, like three birds perched upon the plain, motionless and conspicuous in the sunlight. Then the steeple of Vieuxvicq withdrew, took its proper distance, and the steeples of Martinville remained alone, gilded by the light of the setting sun, which, even at that distance, I could see playing and smiling upon their sloped sides. We had been so long in approaching them that I was thinking of the time that must still elapse before we could reach them when, of a sudden, the carriage, having turned a corner, set us down at their feet; and they had flung themselves so abruptly in our path that we had barely time to stop before being dashed against the porch of the church.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We resumed our course; we had left Martinville some little time, and the village, after accompanying us for a few seconds, had already disappeared, when, lingering alone on the horizon to watch our flight, its steeples and that of Vieuxvicq waved once again, in token of farewell, their sun-bathed pinnacles. Sometimes one would withdraw, so that the other two might watch us for a moment still; then the road changed direction, they veered in the light like three golden pivots, and vanished from my gaze. But, a little later, when we were already close to Combray, the sun having set meanwhile, I caught sight of them for the last time, far away, and seeming no more now than three flowers painted upon the sky above the low line of fields. They made me think, too, of three maidens in a legend, abandoned in a solitary place over which night had begun to fall; and while we drew away from them at a gallop, I could see them timidly seeking their way, and, after some awkward, stumbling movements of their noble silhouettes, drawing close to one another, slipping one behind another, shewing nothing more, now, against the still rosy sky than a single dusky form, charming and resigned, and so vanishing in the night.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_______________________________________\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I never thought again of this page, but at the moment when, on my corner of the box-seat, where the Doctor's coachman was in the habit of placing, in a hamper, the fowls which he had bought at Martinville market, I had finished writing it, I found such a sense of happiness, felt that it had so entirely relieved my mind of the obsession of the steeples, and of the mystery which they concealed, that, as though I myself were a hen and had just laid an egg, I began to sing at the top of my voice.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All day long, during these walks, I had been able to muse upon the pleasure that there would be in the friendship of the Duchesse de Guermantes, in fishing for trout, in drifting by myself in a boat on the Vivonne; and, greedy for happiness, I asked nothing more from life, in such moments, than that it should consist always of a series of joyous afternoons. But when, on our way home, I had caught sight of a farm, on the left of the road, at some distance from two other farms which were themselves close together, and from which, to return to Combray, we need only turn down an avenue of oaks, bordered on one side by a series of orchard-closes, each one planted at regular intervals with apple-trees which cast upon the ground, when they were lighted by the setting sun, the Japanese stencil of their shadows; then, sharply, my heart would begin to beat, I would know that in half an hour we should be at home, and that there, as was the rule on days when we had taken the 'Guermantes way' and dinner was, in consequence, served later than usual, I should be sent to bed as soon as I had swallowed my soup, so that my mother, kept at table, just as though there had been company to dinner, would not come upstairs to say good night to me in bed. The zone of melancholy which I then entered was totally distinct from that other zone, in which I had been bounding for joy a moment earlier, just as sometimes in the sky a band of pink is separated, as though by a line invisibly ruled, from a band of green or black. You may see a bird flying across the pink; it draws near the border-line, touches it, enters and is lost upon the black. The longings by which I had just now been absorbed, to go to Guermantes, to travel, to live a life of happiness\u2014I was now so remote from them that their fulfilment would have afforded me no pleasure. How readily would I have sacrificed them all, just to be able to cry, all night long, in the arms of Mamma! Shuddering with emotion, I could not take my agonised eyes from my mother's face, which was not to appear that evening in the bedroom where I could see myself already lying, in imagination; and wished only that I were lying dead. And this state would persist until the morrow, when, the rays of morning leaning their bars of light, as the gardener might lean his ladder, against the wall overgrown with nasturtiums, which clambered up it as far as my window-sill, I would leap out of bed to run down at once into the garden, with no thought of the fact that evening must return, and with it the hour when I must leave my mother. And so it was from the 'Guermantes way' that I learned to distinguish between these states which reigned alternately in my mind, during certain periods, going so far as to divide every day between them, each one returning to dispossess the other with the regularity of a fever and ague: contiguous, and yet so foreign to one another, so devoid of means of communication, that I could no longer understand, or even picture to myself, in one state what I had desired or dreaded or even done in the other.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' and the 'Guermantes way' remain for me linked with many of the little incidents of that one of all the divers lives along whose parallel lines we are moved, which is the most abundant in sudden reverses of fortune, the richest in episodes; I mean the life of the mind. Doubtless it makes in us an imperceptible progress, and the truths which have changed for us its meaning and its aspect, which have opened new paths before our feet, we had for long been preparing for their discovery; but that preparation was unconscious; and for us those truths date only from the day, from the minute when they became apparent. The flowers which played then among the grass, the water which rippled past in the sunshine, the whole landscape which served as environment to their apparition lingers around the memory of them still with its unconscious or unheeding air; and, certainly, when they were slowly scrutinised by this humble passer-by, by this dreaming child\u2014as the face of a king is scrutinised by a petitioner lost in the crowd\u2014that scrap of nature, that corner of a garden could never suppose that it would be thanks to him that they would be elected to survive in all their most ephemeral details; and yet the scent of hawthorn which strays plundering along the hedge from which, in a little while, the dog-roses will have banished it, a sound of footsteps followed by no echo, upon a gravel path, a bubble formed at the side of a waterplant by the current, and formed only to burst\u2014my exaltation of mind has borne them with it, and has succeeded in making them traverse all these successive years, while all around them the one-trodden ways have vanished, while those who thronged those ways, and even the memory of those who thronged those trodden ways, are dead. Sometimes the fragment of landscape thus transported into the present will detach itself in such isolation from all associations that it floats uncertainly upon my mind, like a flowering isle of Delos, and I am unable to say from what place, from what time\u2014perhaps, quite simply, from which of my dreams\u2014it comes. But it is pre-eminently as the deepest layer of my mental soil, as firm sites on which I still may build, that I regard the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise and Guermantes 'ways.' It is because I used to think of certain things, of certain people, while I was roaming along them, that the things, the people which they taught me to know, and these alone, I still take seriously, still give me joy. Whether it be that the faith which creates has ceased to exist in me, or that reality will take shape in the memory alone, the flowers that people shew me nowadays for the first time never seem to me to be true flowers. The 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' with its lilacs, its hawthorns, its cornflowers, its poppies, its apple-trees, the 'Guermantes way' with its river full of tadpoles, its water-lilies, and its buttercups have constituted for me for all time the picture of the land in which I fain would pass my life, in which my only requirements are that I may go out fishing, drift idly in a boat, see the ruins of a gothic fortress in the grass, and find hidden among the cornfields\u2014as Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs lay hidden\u2014an old church, monumental, rustic, and yellow like a mill-stone; and the cornflowers, the hawthorns, the apple-trees which I may happen, when I go walking, to encounter in the fields, because they are situated at the same depth, on the level of my past life, at once establish contact with my heart. And yet, because there is an element of individuality in places, when I am seized with a desire to see again the 'Guermantes way,' it would not be satisfied were I led to the banks of a river in which were lilies as fair, or even fairer than those in the Vivonne, any more than on my return home in the evening, at the hour when there awakened in me that anguish which, later on in life, transfers itself to the passion of love, and may even become its inseparable companion, I should have wished for any strange mother to come in and say good night to me, though she were far more beautiful and more intelligent than my own. No: just as the one thing necessary to send me to sleep contented (in that untroubled peace which no mistress, in later years, has ever been able to give me, since one has doubts of them at the moment when one believes in them, and never can possess their hearts as I used to receive, in her kiss, the heart of my mother, complete, without scruple or reservation, unburdened by any liability save to myself) was that it should be my mother who came, that she should incline towards me that face on which there was, beneath her eye, something that was, it appears, a blemish, and which I loved as much as all the rest\u2014so what I want to see again is the 'Guermantes way' as I knew it, with the farm that stood a little apart from the two neighbouring farms, pressed so close together, at the entrance to the oak avenue; those meadows upon whose surface, when it is polished by the sun to the mirroring radiance of a lake, are outlined the leaves of the apple-trees; that whole landscape whose individuality sometimes, at night, in my dreams, binds me with a power that is almost fantastic, of which I can discover no trace when I awake.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt, by virtue of having permanently and indissolubly combined in me groups of different impressions, for no reason save that they had made me feel several separate things at the same time, the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise and Guermantes 'ways' left me exposed, in later life, to much disillusionment, and even to many mistakes. For often I have wished to see a person again without realising that it was simply because that person recalled to me a hedge of hawthorns in blossom; and I have been led to believe, and to make some one else believe in an aftermath of affection, by what was no more than an inclination to travel. But by the same qualities, and by their persistence in those of my impressions, to-day, to which they can find an attachment, the two 'ways' give to those impressions a foundation, depth, a dimension lacking from the rest. They invest them, too, with a charm, a significance which is for me alone. When, on a summer evening, the resounding sky growls like a tawny lion, and everyone is complaining of the storm, it is along the 'M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way' that my fancy strays alone in ecstasy, inhaling, through the noise of falling rain, the odour of invisible and persistent lilac-trees.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so I would often lie until morning, dreaming of the old days at Combray, of my melancholy and wakeful evenings there; of other days besides, the memory of which had been more lately restored to me by the taste\u2014by what would have been called at Combray the 'perfume'\u2014-of a cup of tea; and, by an association of memories, of a story which, many years after I had left the little place, had been told me of a love affair in which Swann had been involved before I was born; with that accuracy of detail which it is easier, often, to obtain when we are studying the lives of people who have been dead for centuries than when we are trying to chronicle those of our own most intimate friends, an accuracy which it seems as impossible to attain as it seemed impossible to speak from one town to another, before we learned of the contrivance by which that impossibility has been overcome. All these memories, following one after another, were condensed into a single substance, but had not so far coalesced that I could not discern between the three strata, between my oldest, my instinctive memories, those others, inspired more recently by a taste or 'perfume,' and those which were actually the memories of another, from whom I had acquired them at second hand\u2014no fissures, indeed, no geological faults, but at least those veins, those streaks of colour which in certain rocks, in certain marbles, point to differences of origin, age, and formation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that, when morning drew near, I would long have settled the brief uncertainty of my waking dream, I would know in what room I was actually lying, would have reconstructed it round about me in the darkness, and\u2014fixing my orientation by memory alone, or with the assistance of a feeble glimmer of light at the foot of which I placed the curtains and the window\u2014would have reconstructed it complete and with its furniture, as an architect and an upholsterer might do, working upon an original, discarded plan of the doors and windows; would have replaced the mirrors and set the chest-of-drawers on its accustomed site. 'But scarcely had daylight itself\u2014and no longer the gleam from a last, dying ember on a brass curtain-rod, which I had mistaken for daylight\u2014traced across the darkness, as with a stroke of chalk across a blackboard, its first white correcting ray, when the window, with its curtains, would leave the frame of the doorway, in which I had erroneously placed it, while, to make room for it, the writing-table, which my memory had clumsily fixed where the window ought to be, would hurry off at full speed, thrusting before it the mantelpiece, and sweeping aside the wall of the passage; the well of the courtyard would be enthroned on the spot where, a moment earlier, my dressing-room had lain, and the dwelling-place which I had built up for myself in the darkness would have gone to join all those other dwellings of which I had caught glimpses from the whirlpool of awakening; put to flight by that pale sign traced above my window-curtains by the uplifted forefinger of day.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 123, "api_path": "/songs/2451648", "artist_names": "Sam Hinkie (Ft.

Resignation Letter Lyrics3601 South Broad Street\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania 19148\n[Redacted]\n\nApril 6, 2016\n\nTo the equity partners of Philadelphia 76ers, L.P.:\nI hope this letter finds you well. I have been serving the Sixers at your pleasure for the past 34 months. Atul Gawande, a Surgeon at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, remains (from afar) one of my favorite reads. He laughs that reading scientific studies has long been a guilty pleasure. Reading investor letters has long been one of mine.\n\nWhat I hope to accomplish here is to give you insight into what has transpired behind the scenes in ways you might not have otherwise heard about. Many of you attended our most recent board meeting in New York, where many of these topics were addressed. But for all twelve of you, I hope that this provides a deeper look into what you have at your organization. Accordingly, you should anticipate some mild cheerleading (of others) sprinkled with a healthy dose of self-flagellation about things I\u2019ve done wrong.\nThere has been much criticism of our approach. There will be more. A competitive league like the NBA necessitates a zig while our competitors comfortably zag. We often chose not to defend ourselves against much of the criticism, largely in an effort to stay true to the ideal of having the longest view in the room. To attempt to convince others that our actions are just will serve to paint us in a different light among some of our competitors as progressives worth emulating, versus adversaries worthy of their disdain. Call me old-fashioned, but sometimes the optimal place for your light is hiding directly under a bushel.\n\nLastly, this letter will only speak to the part of the business that I\u2019m today\u2019s steward of: the basketball team and its attendant operations. With Scott O\u2019Neil running our business operations, you are in good hands. I can assure you that when your team is eventually able to compete deep into May, Scott will ably and efficiently separate the good people of the Delaware Valley from their wallets on your behalf.\n\nWorry not.\n\nA league with 30 intense competitors requires a culture of finding new, better ways to solve repeating problems. In the short term, investing in that sort of innovation often doesn\u2019t look like much progress, if any. Abraham Lincoln said \u201cgive me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.\u201d\n\nIn May of 1969, a 38-year-old Warren Buffett sat down at a typewriter to inform his investors that he was closing his fund (then Buffett Partnership). His reason: market conditions were such that he no longer had the requisite confidence that he could make good decisions on behalf of the investors and deliver on his commitments to them. So he would stop investing on their behalf.\n\nFor me, that\u2019s today. Given all the changes to our organization, I no longer have the confidence that I can make good decisions on behalf of investors in the Sixers\u2014you. So I should step down. And I have.\n\nIn one sense, it pains me that it has come to this and that I would go at the end of a particularly down year in the standings, one that has been painful for all of us. But the fact is\u2014and a young Buffett said it much better than I ever could\u2014\u201cI am not attuned to this environment, and I don\u2019t want to spoil a decent record by trying to play a game I don\u2019t understand just so I can go out a hero.\u201d\n\nYup.\nThinking about thinking\nI admire Seth Klarman a great deal. I am consistently impressed by his conviction and humility, a rare combination. About their approach at Baupost, he says, \u201cit isn\u2019t the only way of thinking, but it\u2019s how we approach it.\u201d Below is some insight into a few things we value and how we\u2019ve approached decision making at the Sixers.\n\nFirst, this list is anything but exhaustive, and hardly mine alone. Whenever possible, I think crosspollinating ideas from other contexts is far, far better than attempting to solve our problems in basketball as if no one has ever faced anything similar. Accordingly, this approach comes from a frequent search into behavioral economics, cognitive science, and a lot of observation and trial and error over my 11 years in the NBA. And mistakes. Lots and lots of mistakes.\n\nTo begin, let\u2019s stand on the shoulders of Charlie Munger, a giant to me. He is a man that\u2019s been thinking about thinking longer than I\u2019ve been alive. Let\u2019s start with him and his approach. His two-part technique is:\n\n1. First, what are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered?\n\n2. Second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically doing these things\u2014which by and large are useful, but which often malfunctions?\nTo do this requires you to divorce process from outcome. You can be right for the wrong reasons. In our business, you\u2019re often lionized for it. You can be wrong for the right reasons. This may well prove to be Joel Embiid. There is signal everywhere that Joel is unique, from the practice gyms in Lawrence, Kansas to Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania to Doha, Qatar where he does something awe inspiring far too regularly. We remain hopeful (and optimistic) about his long-term playing career, but we don\u2019t yet know exactly how it will turn out. The decision to draft Joel third, though, still looks to me to be the correct one in hindsight given the underlying reasoning. But to call something that could be wrong (\u201cfailed draft pick\u201d) right (\u201cgood decision\u201d) makes all of our heads hurt, mine included.\n\nSo we have to look deeper at process. Here\u2019s a go at it:\n(I would be dismayed if you don\u2019t see pockets of this kind of thinking throughout the organization. In fact, I will feel like I\u2019ve let you down.)\nThe importance of intellectual humility\nLifelong learning is where it\u2019s at. To walk down that path requires a deep-seated humility about a) what\u2019s knowable, and b) what each of us know. We hire for this aggressively. We celebrate this internally. And we\u2019ve been known to punish when we find it woefully lacking.\n\nWe talk a great deal about being curious, not critical. About asking the question until you understand something truly. About not being afraid to ask the obvious question that everyone else seems to know the answer to. And about the willingness to say three simple words, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nTesla\u2019s Elon Musk describes his everyday stance as, \u201cYou should take the approach that you\u2019re wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.\u201d The physicist James Clerk Maxwell described it as a \u201cthoroughly conscious ignorance\u2014the prelude to every real advance in science.\u201d Bill James of the Boston Red Sox (and, I might add, a Kansas basketball expert) added a little flair when asked whether the learnings available via examining evidence were exhausted: \u201cwe\u2019ve only taken a bucket of knowledge from a sea of ignorance.\u201d\n\nA way to prop up this kind of humility is to keep score. Use a decision journal. Write in your own words what you think will happen and why before a decision. Refer back to it later. See if you were right, and for the right reasons (think Bill Belichick\u2019s famous 4th down decision against Indianapolis in 2009 which summarizes to: good decision, didn\u2019t work). Reading your own past reasoning in your own words in your own handwriting time after time causes the tides of humility to gather at your feet. I\u2019m often in waist-deep water here.\n\nThe other reason to keep track yourself is you\u2019re often the only one to see the most insidious type of errors, the ones the narrative generating parts of our lizard brains storytell their way around\u2014errors of omission. You don\u2019t have a wobbly understanding of just the things you got wrong, but the things you got right but not right enough. Listen to Charlie Munger talk about how he and Berkshire Hathaway should be measured not by their success, but by how much more successful they would have been if they bought more of something: \u201cWe should have bought more Coke.\u201d\n\nThe necessity of innovation\nInvesting in disruptive innovation doesn\u2019t ferment misunderstanding, it necessitates it. Jeff Bezos says it this way: \u201cThere are a few prerequisites to inventing\u2026You have to be willing to fail. You have to be willing to think long-term. You have to be willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time.\u201d\n\nA yearning for innovation requires real exploration. It requires a persistent search to try (and fail) to move your understanding forward with a new tool, a new technique, a new insight. Sadly, the first innovation often isn\u2019t even all that helpful, but may well provide a path to ones that are. This is an idea that Steven Johnson of Where Good Ideas Come From popularized called the \u201cadjacent possible.\u201d Where finding your way through a labyrinth of ignorance requires you to first open a door into a room of understanding, one that by its very existence has new doors to new rooms with deeper insights lurking behind them.\n\nIn most endeavors, it\u2019s fine to be content to woodshed until you get something near perfect. You want that to be you. Grit matters. But it won\u2019t be long until some innovation makes all that effort newly obsolete. You want that to be you, too.The longest view in the room\nIt is critical to be cycle aware in a talent-driven league. In a situation like yours at the Sixers, where a variety of circumstances left you near a trough in the cycle (and falling), amplifying this cycle became crucial. Today\u2019s outcomes for every team are heavily impacted by decisions past (who to draft, sign, trade, hire, etc.). Jeff Bezos says that if Amazon has a good quarter it\u2019s because of work they did 3, 4, 5 years ago\u2014not because they did a good job that quarter. Today\u2019s league-leading Golden State Warriors acquired Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut, and Klay Thompson almost 4 years ago, nearly 4 years ago exactly, and almost 5 years ago. In this league, the long view picks at the lock of mediocrity.\n\nWhile some organizations (like ours) have this as part of their ethos, for others it is the ethos. Check out the 10,000 Year Clock. It is no mere thought experiment, but an actual clock being designed to be placed inside a mountain in West Texas, wound, and left to tick and chime for ten thousand years. Why? Because to design something that lasts that long makes us all consider what the world will look like between now and then. In return, we might be inspired to do something about it.\nMore practically, to take the long view has an unintuitive advantage built in\u2014fewer competitors.\n\nHere\u2019s Warren Buffett in the late 80s on this topic: \u201cIn any sort of a contest\u2014financial, mental, or physical\u2014it\u2019s an enormous advantage to have opponents who have been taught that it's useless to even try.\u201d\n\nAsk who wants to trade for an in-his-prime Kevin Garnett and 30 hands will go up. Ask who planned for it three or four years in advance and Danny Ainge is nearly alone. Same for Daryl Morey in Houston trading for James Harden. San Antonio\u2019s Peter Holt said after signing LaMarcus Aldridge this summer, \u201cR.C. [Buford] came to us with this plan three years ago, four years ago\u2014seriously. And we\u2019ve worked at it ever since.\u201dA contrarian mindset\nThis one is tricky, and getting more so in a league as healthy and popular as the NBA that is covered by beat writers, columnists, bloggers, commentators, and fans minute-to-minute. If you want to have real success you have to very often be willing to do something different from the herd.\n\nA few examples might help. Step away from basketball and imagine for a moment this is investment management, and your job is to take your client\u2019s money and make it grow. It\u2019s January 1, 2015 and the S&P 500 is $171.60, exactly the same price it has been since January 1, 1985. No fluctuation up or down. Flat every single day. And your job for every day of the past 30 years is to make money for your clients by investing. What would you do?\n\nIn the NBA, that\u2019s wins. The same 82 games are up for grabs every year for every team. Just like in 1985 (or before). To get more wins, you\u2019re going to have to take them from someone else. Wins are a zero-growth industry (how many of you regularly choose to invest in those?), and the only way up is to steal share from your competitors. You will have to do something different. You will have to be contrarian.\n\nHoward Marks describes this as a necessary condition of great performance: you have to be nonconsensus and right. Both. That means you have to find some way to have a differentiated viewpoint from the masses. And it needs to be right. Anything less won\u2019t work.\n\nBut this is difficult, emotionally and intellectually. Seth Klarman talks about the comfort of consensus. It\u2019s much more comfortable to have people generally agreeing with you. By definition, those opportunities in a constrained environment winnow away with each person that agrees with you, though. It reminds me of when we first moved to Palo Alto. Within about a week of living there a voice kept telling me, \u201cThis is great. Great weather, 30 minutes to the ocean, 3 hours to ski, a vibrant city 30 miles away, and one of the world\u2019s best research universities within walking distance. People should really move here.\u201d Then I looked at real estate prices. I was right, yes, but this view was decidedly not a non-consensus view. My viewpoint as a Silicon Valley real estate dilettante, which took a whole week to form, had been priced in. Shocker.\n\nTo develop truly contrarian views will require a never-ending thirst for better, more diverse inputs.\nWhat player do you think is most undervalued? Get him for your team. What basketball axiom is most likely to be untrue? Take it on and do the opposite. What is the biggest, least valuable time sink for the organization? Stop doing it. Otherwise, it\u2019s a big game of pitty pat, and you\u2019re stuck just hoping for good things to happen, rather than developing a strategy for how to make them happen.\nThere has to be a willingness to tolerate counterarguments, hopefully in such a way that you can truly understand and summarize the other side\u2019s arguments at least as well as they can. And then, after all that, still have the conviction to separate yourself from the herd.A tolerance of uncertainty\nThis one can be really difficult, especially when the stakes are high. But it\u2019s critical to making rational decisions over the long term. We are all so tempted to simplify when something is hard to think about, simply to get it out of our mind by treating it as impossible.\n\nThis goes from academic sounding to life altering in basketball team building, though. Looking at a player with an estimated 10% or 20% chance of being a star over the next three or four years can\u2019t be written to zero\u2014that\u2019s about as high as those odds ever get. That\u2019s surely a very, very high number for any player that is ever available to you to be added to your team. Once you accept that, it becomes clear that shrinking the confidence interval around that estimate (and the estimates of the downside risk at the other end of the spectrum) becomes pretty darn important.\n\nBut our well worn thinking patterns often let us down here. Phil Tetlock, from just down the street at Penn, addresses this well in his most recent remarkable book Superforecasting where he quotes the great Amos Tversky saying, \u201cIn dealing with probabilities\u2026most people only have three settings: \u201cgonna happen,\u201d \u201cnot gonna happen,\u201d and \u201cmaybe\u201d.\u201d Jeff Van Gundy sums it up succinctly on our telecasts, \u201cit\u2019s a make or miss league.\u201d He\u2019s right.\n\nIn some decisions, the uncertainties are savage. You have to find a way to get comfortable with that range of outcomes. If you can\u2019t, you\u2019re forced to live with many fewer options to choose amongst which leads over the long term to lesser and lesser outcomes.\n\nThe illusion of control is an opiate, though. Nonetheless, it is annoyingly necessary to get comfortable with many grades of maybe. Sixers fans come up to me to say hello and many of them say the same thing (almost instinctively) as we part, \u201cGood luck.\u201d My standard reply: \u201cThanks. We\u2019ll need it.\u201dBe long science\nScience is about predictions. Understanding the world until you can make a prediction about what will happen next. If you\u2019re not sure, test it. Measure it. Do it again. See if it repeats.\n\n\u201cSo if we want to think like a scientist more often in life, those are the three key objectives\u2014to be humbler about what we know, more confident about what\u2019s possible, and less afraid of things that don\u2019t matter.\u201d That\u2019s from Tim Urban, who will soon be recognized as one of tomorrow\u2019s polymaths (like many of you, he lives in New York\u2014I\u2019d recommend meeting him for coffee sometime).\n\nFor the Sixers, this has meant efforts like tracking every shot in every gym where we shoot, making predictions in writing about what we think will happen with a player or a team, and generally asking more questions about the game than some are comfortable to have said aloud.A healthy respect for tradition\nWhile contrarian views are absolutely necessary to truly deliver, conventional wisdom is still wise. It is generally accepted as the conventional view because it is considered the best we have. Get back on defense. Share the ball. Box out. Run the lanes. Contest a shot. These things are real and have been measured, precisely or not, by thousands of men over decades of trial and error. Hank Iba. Dean Smith. Red Auerbach. Gregg Popovich. The single best place to start is often wherever they left off.\n\nThere are plenty of caricatures of our approach on your behalf, the most common of which is that folks here don\u2019t even watch the games. That instead there is some mystical way by which we make decisions that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with building a basketball team. That\u2019s simply untrue.\n\nMaybe someday the information teams have at their disposal won\u2019t require scouring the globe watching talented players and teams. That day has not arrived, and my Marriott Rewards points prove it from all the Courtyards I sleep in from November to March. There is so much about projecting players that we still capture best by seeing it in person and sharing (and debating) those observations with our colleagues.\n\nWhat kind of teammate is he? How does he play under pressure? How broken is his shot? Can he fight over a screen? Does he respond to coaching? How hard will he work to improve? And maybe the key one: will he sacrifice\u2014his minutes, his touches, his shots, his energy, his body\u2014for the ultimate team game that rewards sacrifice? That information, as imperfect and subjective as it may be, comes to light most readily in gyms and by watching an absolute torrent of video.\n\nSome tradition awaits us everyday at the office. I inherited Marlene Barnes as my executive assistant, a widowed lifelong Philadelphian that joined the Sixers in the fall of 1977. I was born in the winter of 1977.\n\nMarlene has worked for 11 different GMs and 5 head coaches at the Sixers. The names evoke many memories for you lifelong Sixers fans and students of history like me: Pat Williams, John Nash, Gene Shue, Jim Lynam, John Lucas, Brad Greenberg, Larry Brown, Billy King, Ed Stefanski, Rod Thorn. With us, she was immediately thrown into a new, more entrepreneurial work environment with a boss full of quirks different than any she had ever encountered. She adapted wonderfully, and now is a regular Slack wizard along with much of our staff, has seamlessly plugged into one productivity hack after another, and has ordered more books from Amazon than she ever thought possible. Her presence served as an everyday reminder to me of the impermanence of my leadership. I told her within a few weeks of working together that when I see her in the mornings I\u2019m reminded that I am a steward\u2014today\u2019s steward\u2014of her Sixers.A reverence for disruption\nSo often a new management regime looks at an organization and decides that the primary goal is to professionalize the operation. For you, I hope that doesn\u2019t happen next. As I described to you in our first ever board meeting, we were fundamentally aiming for something different\u2014disruption. We should concentrate our efforts in a few key areas in ways others had proven unwilling. We should attempt to gain a competitive advantage that had a chance to be lasting, hopefully one unforeseen enough by our competition to leapfrog them from a seemingly disadvantaged position. A goal that lofty is anything but certain. And it sure doesn\u2019t come from those that are content to color within the lines.\n\nThis is true everywhere, as the balance in any market or any ecosystem ebbs and flows until something mostly unexpected lurches ahead. We see it in spades\u2014past, present, and future.\n\n\u2022 New Zealand\u2019s flightless bird the moa (measuring in at 10 ft, 400 lbs.) had the life tramping around the South Island for a great long run; then the first M\u0101ori explorers washed ashore in canoes, and that was that.\n\n\u2022 I still miss Blackberry\u2019s keyboard, but the 2007 iPhone debut rendered it nearly obsolete to all but a few of us curmudgeons.\n\n\u2022 Watch what\u2019s happening with the collaboration between IBM\u2019s Watson and M.D. Anderson or Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo. It won\u2019t be just an ancient board game that\u2019s disrupted. It\u2019s also anything but a game to Lee Sedol.\n\nNobel Prize winning physicist Max Planck got right to it: \u201cA new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die.\u201d\n\nThat sounds harsh, more harsh than anything I would ever say. But think about it in your context as an equity partner in the Sixers. Every April you will watch 16 of the 30 teams\u2014the last time that exact configuration of players and coaches will ever be together\u2014\u201cdie\u201d as their season ends. Within a few weeks, another seven go fishing. By early June, 29 of the 30 opponents are forced to see the light of the competition\u2019s greatness as only one raises the Larry O\u2019Brien trophy.I can imagine that some of these sound contradictory: contrarian thinking, but respect for tradition, while looking to disrupt. That yin and yang is part of it\u2014keep looking. Questioning.\n\nInvestment objectives\nStarting position\nIn May of 2013 when I spoke with several of you\u2014and even when we first met in the summer of 2012\u2014the situation was clear. Your crops had been eaten. A team that clawed its way to a disappointing 34 wins in 2012-13 had a few handfuls of those wins walking out the door (Dorell Wright, Nick Young, Damien Wilkins, Royal Ivey) and a player that drove a bit more who had just undergone a surgery and was expected to be out for the season (Jason Richardson). That left the club with expected wins in the low 20s before replacing anyone. The young players on rookie-scale deals numbered two: Evan Turner & Arnett Moultrie. Two future first round picks were gone as was the recent youth pipeline of Nik Vu\u010devi\u0107 & Moe Harkless. Gulp.\n\nOutsiders agreed. ESPN regularly ranks the forward-looking three years for each team in their Future Power Rankings. They take into account the team\u2019s current roster and future potential of those players as about half the rating, then include future draft picks, cap position, coaching, management, etc.\n\nThe Sixers near-term future ranked 24th in a 30-team league.\n\nIn the press conference announcing my arrival at the Sixers, I said:\n\n\u2022 Our challenge was not for the faint of heart. It wasn\u2019t.\n\u2022 Our challenge was big enough to humble me to think about the enormity of it. It did.\n\nWe would have to get so very much right.\n\nGoals\nThe strategy we settled on was straightforward, even if arduous. Replenish the talent pipeline, improve the quality and quantity of players on the roster, shift the style of play towards tomorrow\u2019s champions, and become a culture focused on innovation.\n\nYou heard me speak of these goals at each of our quarterly board meetings; always the same since June of 2013. Variety is overrated.\n\nThis continuity of focus has served to frustrate many. I\u2019ve found those most frustrated are those that either underestimate the enormity of the challenge or fundamentally want something else.\n\nSpecifically, we set out to maximize the odds of acquiring star players using all three available methods of acquiring players (draft, free agency, and trade).\n\n1. Draft: invest in the deepest pool of star players\u2014young players via the NBA Draft.\n\n2. Free Agency: maintain financial flexibility to assume contract liabilities of other teams to acquire picks and prospects and move quickly toward special opportunities in signings/trade.\n\n3. Trade: gather attractive, improving players to (best case) develop to win games for the Sixers, or (worst case) trade for better players or players likely to improve at a faster rate.\n\nWe determined to play a faster style that recognizes the importance of speed in tomorrow\u2019s NBA and one that quickly integrates young players. We set out to improve our shot selection toward high efficiency basketball. We also wanted to build a defensive identity that\u2014in time\u2014could thwart tomorrow\u2019s high-efficiency offenses. Lastly, we needed to build a world-class training center, develop an ever-evolving player development program, and change the organization\u2019s culture to one of innovation and a constant search for competitive edge.\n\nThese goals were not to fit some preferred style of play, but instead were aiming for where future champions would be crowned. That original document I gave to Josh and David in 2012 said:\n\nHistory\u2019s lessons are clear, but tomorrow\u2019s championship caliber teams may break from historical trends:\n\u2022 Example: A 3PA-happy champion like Orlando under Stan Van Gundy\n\u2022 Example: A fast-paced champion like Phoenix under Mike D\u2019Antoni\n\nFast forward three years and Golden State made the 3rd most 3s in NBA history to win the Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, who made the 8th most 3s in NBA history. Coach Van Gundy\u2019s most 3PA-happy team from Orlando proudly sits smack dab between them in 5th place all time (for now). The Warriors did this in part by playing at the fastest pace of any NBA team last season, considerably faster than Coach D\u2019Antoni\u2019s fastest Suns team.\n\nResults\nThe dozen of you know much about our team, our players, and how we\u2019re positioned. I won\u2019t waste your time by going through each person in detail, as you have had many opportunities to meet our coaches and players, hear about our talented staff, and see their performance dissected and analyzed in our meetings.\n\nInstead, I will try to make the best use of your time by sharing some insight into the inner workings behind the scenes and a few details that aren\u2019t appropriate for wider consumption.\n\nPlayers\nIt is worth noting that over the long term, basketball teambuilding is about one primary thing\u2014the players. Those players the team has on the roster at the time and those they hold the rights to. Plus those that are to follow. All of the operations, from management to coaches to support staff to systems only exist for one reason\u2014the players.\n\nWe have had the good fortune of drafting relatively early, giving us access to some especially talented players, including Jahlil Okafor (#3), Joel Embiid (#3), and Nerlens Noel (#6). Many in our office tried to set a line of when Jahlil would see his first double team in this league. Those with the under looked smart by the end of opening night, where he went for 26 points and 7 rebounds.\n\nWe also put ourselves into position to draft in the second round, where we found two 22-year-old gems to date, including Jerami Grant (#39) and Richaun Holmes (#37). Outside of the top 60 selections delivered two more players with real NBA futures in 24-year-old T.J. McConnell and 25-year-old Robert Covington.\n\nRobert is a mistake I rubbed my own nose in for over a year.\nThe 2013 Draft was a flurry of activity for us\u2014a handful of trades and selections in both the first and second rounds. We had more action following the draft as we tried to finalize our summer league team and get the myriad trade calls set up with the NBA. I could see this coming a few days before and we informed the media that this kind of approach might lead to an unusually late start for the post-draft press conference. Several of you were still there late that night. At about 1:00 a.m. I went downstairs to address an equally exhausted media on deadline from their editors.\n\nWhen I returned upstairs, the undrafted Robert Covington was gone, having agreed to play for another club\u2019s summer league team, eventually making their regular season roster. He torched the D-League that year, haunting me all the while. When he became available 17 months later, we pounced. But I shudder, even now, at that (nearly) missed opportunity.\n\nEven our efforts to support our players serve as a reminder of the enormity of our challenge.\n\nSomething important to us is to find ways to be supportive to our players' larger extended families and loved ones that take this journey with them. One group, too casually referred to as \"the wives club\" at many NBA teams, helps support players' families in getting acclimated to the city by handling tickets for loved ones, volunteering in community events, hosting baby showers, and the like. In 2013 my wife and I arrived at the arena one night to host a few from this group. While I was prepared to highlight for the group the team\u2019s family room, child care at the arena, etc., it turned out that our attendance at this event totaled two. Two mothers. It was a pointed reminder of just how young our team was.\n\nThis story underscores what our players, particularly our best players, are in greatest need of\u2014time.\n\nThe gap between driving wins today and driving wins tomorrow will be heavily influenced by a bunch of factors, but the biggest one is time. For players like Jahlil, Nerlens, and Jerami, getting much nearer the middle of their new NBA cohort will go a long way toward letting their talents shine through, just as it has their whole basketball lives when they were nearer the middle of those cohorts. Get down the experience curve, the faster the better. They are 20, 21, and 22 years old.A larger quiver\nWe need to identify high potential prospects and find ways to add them to our program. Then we need to work with them on their game in a targeted way to maximize their performance, their impact on the floor, and their value. One way is to draft them and put them on our 15-man roster. We do that.\n\nAnother is to draft them and hold their exclusive NBA rights while they play professionally in a league that doesn\u2019t start with N and end with A. Now we do that.\n\nThese players can develop under our guidance while not counting against our roster, giving us not just 15 opportunities at one time, but several more. When appropriate for our team\u2014but subject to buyout clauses in their professional contracts abroad\u2014we can sign them to our club as one of our 15. This can happen within a season, at season\u2019s end, or whenever their contract is available for buyout.\n\nThese sets of players are viable players for the Sixers and viable options to trade in the interim. The goal is simple\u2014a larger quiver. This quiver will give us more options immediately and more options over time. Several players have been affiliated with us during the past several years while playing for teams in Australia, Asia, several clubs in Europe, and our minor-league affiliate the Delaware 87ers. As of now, we hold three players on this list, highlighted by the 21-year-old Dario \u0160ari\u0107. Dario is a 6-10 forward with a guard\u2019s skills and a big\u2019s toughness. Twice voted as FIBA European Young Player of the Year, we were in position to draft him in part because he required something you\u2019ve had in ample supply: one part courage, two parts patience. He will look great in Sixers blue.\nThis approach, like many that create value, isn\u2019t popular, particularly locally. But it\u2019s also nothing new, just the same typeface bolded. It requires deep player evaluations around the globe, is helped by a network of international relationships, and most of all, patience. The venerable San Antonio Spurs don\u2019t have three rights-held players playing internationally like we now do, they have thirteen. Most of their names are hard for many fans to pronounce. Ginobili used to be, too.\n\nThe NBA began this season with 100 international players from 37 countries on opening night rosters, comprising over 20% of the league. This is no set of wallflowers either, with four of the last thirteen Finals MVPs in this group. I pine for the days of the Long Beach Summer League at the Pyramid\u2014I now spend as much time in China as Los Angeles.Draft picks\nWhile the young players on our team and rights-held players internationally continue to show promise, our ability to add to that group by layering in additional high quality talent via the draft, free agency, and trade is at an all-time high.\n\nIn the first 26 months on the job we added more than one draft pick (or pick swap) per month to our coffers. That\u2019s more than 26 new picks or options to swap picks over and above the two per year the NBA allots each club. That\u2019s not any official record, because no one keeps track of such records. But it is the most ever. And it\u2019s not close. And we kick ourselves for not adding another handful.\nMany of us remember exactly where we were when tragedy strikes and we think of what could have been. For me\u2014and this is sad for my own mental well being\u2014that list includes the January day in 2014 when Miami traded Joel Anthony and two second round picks to our formidable competitors the Celtics. I can still picture the child\u2019s play table I paced around at Lankenau Medical Center on my cell phone while negotiating with Miami\u2019s front office. This was in between feedings for our newborn twins, when my wife and I were still sleeping in the hospital. Danny Ainge finalized that deal (and several other better ones) and received one first-place vote for Executive of the Year that season: mine.\n\nWe have used several of those picks to move around in the draft, to facilitate other deals, in trade for players to add to our team, and to select players for our team. Players like Jerami Grant (part of the haul from the Spencer Hawes trade), Nerlens Noel & Dario Saric (via the Jrue Holiday trade and its derivative), Ish Smith (used one of the two picks we acquired in the Eric Maynor trade, plus another), Richaun Holmes (part of the proceeds via the K.J. McDaniels trade), and others. Yet we still retain the rights to more future 2nd round picks at our disposal going forward than 27 other NBA teams.\n\nIn the upcoming May draft lottery, we have what will likely be the best ever odds to get the #1 overall pick (nearly 30%), a roughly 50/50 chance at a top-2 pick (the highest ever), and a roughly 50/50 chance at two top-5 picks, which would be the best lottery night haul ever. That same bounce of a ping pong ball (almost a flip of a coin) will determine if we have three first round picks this year (unusual) or four (unprecedented). That's this year. Or this quarter, if you will.\n\nIf you were to estimate the value of those firsts and the ones to follow, from this point forward we have essentially two NBA teams\u2019 worth of first round pick value plus the third most second round picks in the league.Salary cap position\nOur salary cap position going forward is easily the NBA's best. The most room, the most flexibility, providing the widest available set of options in free agency or trade of any club. This stockpile can be used all at once or strategically over the ensuing years to acquire players that fit your team, improve in your development program, and help you move up the standings. During this phase of acquiring players and picks to really invest in our future and climb higher than we have in over 30 years, we spent a bit over $135M on payroll across the three seasons, while the NBA median spend was over $200M. That won\u2019t last, as over time a climb up the standings will see spend rise precipitously as well.\n\nThese advantages over our competitors are material, but well short of deterministic. From here a whole host of solid decisions are necessary to play our hand out of this stacked deck.Other\nBuilding a talent pipeline into our program, while important, is of course not the only goal we had.\n\nEven with young players and expected roster turnover, we needed to move the club toward a style that was conducive to winning in tomorrow\u2019s NBA. We improved our pace from below average to 1st immediately, then settled into about 6th for the next two seasons. We moved our shot selection from consistently bottom two in the league to consistently 2nd in the league. And our defensive principles are increasingly top-notch, showing that we can play above average defense (13th) when we had solid veteran defenders like Luc Mbah a Moute on the roster, but also struggle with some of the NBA\u2019s youngest talent defending every night (bottom 5).\n\nOutlook\nYour club is on solid footing now, with much hard work yet to be done. As we continued to invest in young players, acquire more draft selections, and maintain cap flexibility the forward-looking markets took notice. Our Future Franchise Rankings (ESPN\u2019s) that began at 24th in a 30-team league in May of 2013 climbed to 19th in 2014, 17th in 2015, and most recently via RealGM\u2019s rankings in December of 2015, 12th. I think that is imminently reasonable, as is a couple of spots higher.\n\nLottery night will be nerve-wracking for most and exciting for all. I said to Josh & David last year during the NBA\u2019s Draft Lottery that it is rare for the importance of luck in our lives to be laid bare for the whole world to see. Walking out with a top-5 pick in each hand would be exciting, but it\u2019s not necessary. The rights to those picks don\u2019t extinguish, but instead move forward to a future year, one filled with new possibilities and challenges both.\n\nRegardless of the haul that comes out of a May night in New York, the team is likely to see additional lottery pick talent hit the court next season regardless. Two additional first round picks this year are available to you as well. Plus additional draft picks are set to flow in regularly for many years to come. Plus the league\u2019s best cap position. A bevy of young players. A deep and passionate coaching staff. An innovative management team. A beautiful new practice facility set to open before training camp. In a city with wonderful basketball heritage. You could do worse.\n\nThe NBA can be a league of desperation, those that are in it and those that can avoid it. So many find themselves caught in the zugzwang, the point in the game where all possible moves make you worse off. Your positioning is now the opposite of that.\n\nA sincere thank you\nThank you for the opportunity you all gave me to lead this storied franchise. My gratification is beyond my power to express. What is unequivocal is that the principal beneficiary of your largesse has been me. Thank you.\n\nPhiladelphia has been wonderful to our family. Two of our children were born here. Lincoln said that to meet with the public \u201crenewed in me my perceptions of responsibility and duty.\u201d Those words rang hollow until we moved here and I talked with our fans. Everywhere I went, lifelong Sixers fans told me stories about how they wanted the team to be good again--really good.\n\nIt\u2019s clear now that I won\u2019t see the harvest of the seeds we planted. That\u2019s OK. Life\u2019s like that. Many of my NBA friends cautioned me against the kind of seed sowing that felt appropriate given the circumstances for exactly this reason. But this particular situation made it all the more necessary, though. Part of the reason to reject fear and plow on was exactly because fear had been the dominant motivator of the actions of too many for too long.\n\nI will be repotted professionally. That is often uncomfortable; most growth is. But it\u2019s also often healthier over the longer sweep of history, too.\n\nIn the interim, I\u2019ll probably be with my wife and kids for a few weeks. If you need to reach me\u2014now or later\u2014I am available at [redacted] and I suspect someday soon on Twitter via @samhinkie.\n\nI wish you the best of luck. Like other Sixers fans, I will cross my fingers for you on lottery night in New York.6Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2004152", "artist_names": "Al Casey",

than the Splenda that was thrown inside the blender\nSo you wanna get crunk while you mix it with the liquor\nNigga, people like you, I don't get ya\nClaimin' you a baller but your momma living with ya\nBetter look inside the picture, 'cause you ain't getting richer\nNow it's hard to see his son 'cause the momma took him with her\n\n[Chorus]\nYour momma ain't shit, your daddy ain't shit\nAnd then

endeavor\nFrom the streets to the clubs, to the guns, to the cheddar\nTill you get a phone call, email, or a letter\nThat your jit locked up or he dead on the stretcher\nBetter parenting is the main pressure\nYour daughter got kids but wasn't taught about pleasure\nYour kids are the treasure, the love you couldn't measure\nWill end up in the hole if you don't get it together32Embed"}, {"_type":

home in a single file, every inch is a quarter mile\nAin't heard nobody sing, ain't seen one livin' thing\n\nSomeone's waitin' for me, honey sweet as candy\nWanna hold her tight\nLord, make her be alright\nMaybe 'round on next bend, all the ashes of land\nValleys will be green instead of what I've seen\nI'm afraid for the scrubby pine, for the sweet honeysuckle vine\nI'm afraid for my home, for the fields that I roamed\nKick along down a homeward road, and your heart's gotta take the load\nI'm afraid to go home, I'm afraid to go home\n\nSherman's been in my town, burned it all to the

For instance, did you know that some modern dictionaries are notoriously liberal and others notoriously conservative, and that certain conservative dictionaries were actually conceived and designed as corrective responses to the \"corruption\" and \"permissiveness\" of certain liberal dictionaries? That the oligarchic device of having a special \"Distinguished Usage Panel ... of outstanding professional speakers and writers\" is an attempted compromise between the forces of egalitarianism and traditionalism in English, but that most linguistic liberals dismiss the Usage Panel as mere sham-populism? Did you know that U.S. lexicography even had a seamy underbelly?\n\nThe occasion for this article is Oxford University Press's semi-recent release of Bryan A. Garner's A Dictionary of Modern American Usage. The fact of the matter is that Garner's dictionary is extremely good, certainly the most comprehensive usage guide since E. W. Gilman's Webster's Dictionary of English Usage, now a decade out of date.[1] Its format, like that of Gilman and the handful of other great American usage guides of the last century, includes entries on individual words and phrases and expostulative small-cap MINI-ESSAYS. on any issue broad enough to warrant more general discussion. But the really distinctive and ingenious features of A Dictionary of Modern American Usage involve issues of rhetoric and ideology and style, and it is impossible to describe why these issues are important and why Garner's management of them borders on genius without talking about the historical contexts [2] in which ADMAU appears, and this context turns out to be a veritable hurricane of controversies involving everything from technical linguistics to public education to political ideology, and these controversies take a certain amount of time to unpack before their relation to what makes Garner's usage guide so eminently worth your hard-earned reference-book dollar can even be established; and in fact there's no way even to begin the whole harrowing polymeric discussion without taking a moment to establish and define the highly colloquial term SNOOT.\n\nFrom one perspective, a certain irony attends the publication of any good new book on American usage. It is that the people who are going to be interested in such a book are also the people who are least going to need it, i.e., that offering counsel on the finer points of U.S. English is Preaching to the Choir. The relevant Choir here comprises that small percentage of American citizens who actually care about the current status of double modals and ergative verbs. The same sorts of people who watched Story of English on PBS (twice) and read W. Safire's column with their half-caff every Sunday. The sorts of people who feel that special blend of wincing despair and sneering superiority when they see EXPRESS LANE \u2014 10 ITEMS OR LESS or hear dialogue used as a verb or realize that the founders of the Super 8 motel chain must surely have been ignorant of the meaning of suppurate. There are lots of epithets for people like this \u2014 Grammar Nazis, Usage Nerds, Syntax Snobs, the Language Police. The term I was raised with is SNOOT.[3] The word might be slightly self-mocking, but those other terms are outright dysphemisms. A SNOOT can be defined as somebody who knows what dysphemism means and doesn't mind letting you know it.\n\nI submit that we SNOOTs are just about the last remaining kind of truly elitist nerd. There are, granted, plenty of nerd-species in today's America, and some of these are elitist within their own nerdy purview (e.g., the skinny, carbuncular, semi-autistic Computer Nerd moves instantly up on the totem pole of status when your screen freezes and now you need his help, and the bland condescension with which he performs the two occult keystrokes that unfreeze your screen is both elitist and situationally valid). But the SNOOT's purview is interhuman social life itself. You don't, after all (despite withering cultural pressure), have to use a computer, but you can't escape language: Language is everything and everywhere; it's what lets us have anything to do with one another; it's what separates us from the animals; Genesis 11:7-10 and so on. And we SNOOTS know when and how to hyphenate phrasal adjectives and to keep participles from dangling, and we know that we know, and we know how very few other Americans know this stuff or even care, and we judge them accordingly.\n\nIn ways that certain of us are uncomfortable about, SNOOTs' attitudes about contemporary usage resemble religious/political conservatives' attitudes about contemporary culture:[4] We combine a missionary zeal and a near-neural faith in our beliefs' importance with a curmudgeonly hell-in-a-handbasket despair at the way English is routinely manhandled and corrupted by supposedly educated people. The Evil is all around us: boners and clunkers and solecistic howlers and bursts of voguish linguistic methane that make any SNOOT's cheek twitch and forehead darken. A fellow SNOOT I know likes to say that listening to most people's English feels like watching somebody use a Stradivarius to pound nails. We[5] are the Few, the Proud, the Appalled at Everyone Else.\nTHESIS STATEMENT FOR WHOLE ARTICLE\n\nIssues of tradition vs. egalitarianism in U.S. English are at root political issues and can be effectively addressed only in what this article hereby terms a \"Democratic Spirit.\" A Democratic Spirit is one that combines rigor and humility, i.e., passionate conviction plus sedulous respect for the convictions of others. As any American knows, this is a very difficult spirit to cultivate and maintain, particularly when it comes to issues you feel strongly about. Equally tough is a D.S.'s criterion of 100 percent intellectual integrity \u2014 you have to be willing to look honestly at yourself and your motives for believing what you believe, and to do it more or less continually.\n\nThis kind of stuff is advanced U.S. citizenship. A true Democratic Spirit is up there with religious faith and emotional maturity and all those other top-of-the-Maslow-Pyramid-type qualities people spend their whole lives working on. A Democratic Spirit's constituent rigor and humility and honesty are in fact so hard to maintain on certain issues that it's almost irresistibly tempting to fall in with some established dogmatic camp and to follow that camp's line on the issue and to let your position harden within the camp and become inflexible and to believe that any other camp is either evil or insane and to spend all your time and energy trying to shout over them.\n\nI submit, then, that it is indisputably easier to be dogmatic than Democratic, especially about issues that are both vexed and highly charged. I submit further that the issues surrounding \"correctness\" in contemporary American usage are both vexed and highly charged, and that the fundamental questions they involve are ones whose answers have to be \"worked out\" instead of simply found.\n\nA distinctive feature of ADMAU is that its author is willing to acknowledge that a usage dictionary is not a bible or even a textbook but rather just the record of one smart person's attempts to work out answers to certain very difficult questions. This willingness appears to me to be informed by a Democratic Spirit. The big question is whether such a spirit compromises Garner's ability to present himself as a genuine \"authority\" on issues of usage. Assessing Garner's book, then, involves trying to trace out the very weird and complicated relationship between Authority and Democracy in what we as a culture have decided is English. That relationship is, as many educated Americans would say, still in process at this time.\n\nA Dictionary of Modern American Usage has no Editorial Staff or Distinguished Panel. It's conceived, researched, and written ab ovo usque ad mala by Bryan Garner. This is an interesting guy. He's both a lawyer and a lexicographer (which seems a bit like being both a narcotics dealer and a DEA agent). His 1987 A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage is already a minor classic; now, instead of practicing law anymore, he goes around conducting writing seminars for J.D.'s and doing prose-consulting for various judicial bodies. Garner's also the founder of something called the H. W. Fowler Society,[6] a worldwide group of usage-Trekkies who like to send one another linguistic boners clipped from different periodicals. You get the idea. This Garner is one serious and very hard-core SNOOT.\n\nThe lucid, engaging, and extremely sneaky Preface to ADMAU serves to confirm Garner's SNOOTitude in fact while undercutting it in tone. For one thing, whereas the traditional usage pundit cultivates a sort of remote and imperial persona \u2014 the kind who uses one or we to refer to himself \u2014 Garner gives us an almost Waltonishly endearing sketch of his own background:\n\nI realized early at the age of 15[7] \u2014 that my primary\nintellectual interest was the use of the English language....\nIt became an all-consuming passion.... I read everything\nI could find on the subject. Then, on a wintry evening\nwhile visiting New Mexico at the age of 16, I discovered\nEric Partridge's Usage and Abusage. I was enthralled.\nNever had I held a more exciting book.... Suffice it\nto say that by the time I was 18, I had committed to\nmemory most of Fowler, Partridge, and their successors....\n\nAlthough this reviewer regrets the biosketch's failure to mention the rather significant social costs of being an adolescent whose overriding passion is English usage,[8] the critical hat is off to yet another personable section of the Preface, one that Garner entitles \"First Principles\": \"Before going any further, I should explain my approach. That's an unusual thing for the author of a usage dictionary to do \u2014 unprecedented, as far as I know. But a guide to good writing is only as good as the principles on which it's based. And users should be naturally interested in those principles. So, in the interests of full disclosure ...\"[9]\nThe \"unprecedented\" and \"full disclosure\" here are actually good-natured digs at Garner's Fowlerite predecessors, and a subtle nod to one camp in the wars that have raged in both lexicography and education ever since the notoriously liberal Webster's Third New International Dictionary came out in 1961 and included such terms as heighth and irregardless without any monitory labels on them. You can think of Webster's Third as sort of the Fort Sumter of the contemporary Usage Wars. These Wars are both the context and the target of a very subtle rhetorical strategy in A Dictionary of Modern American Usage, and without talking about them it's impossible to explain why Garner's book is both so good and so sneaky.\n\nWe regular citizens tend to go to The Dictionary for authoritative guidance.[10] Rarely, however, do we ask ourselves who decides what gets in The Dictionary or what words or spellings or pronunciations get deemed \"substandard\" or \"incorrect.\" Whence the authority of dictionary-makers to decide what's OK[11] and what isn't? Nobody elected them, after all. And simply appealing to precedent or tradition won't work, because what's considered correct changes over time. In the 1600s, for instance, the second-singular pronoun took a singular conjugation \u2014 \"You is.\" Earlier still, the standard 2-S pronoun wasn't \"you\" but \"thou\". Huge numbers of now acceptable words like clever, fun, banter, and prestigious entered English as what usage authorities considered errors or egregious slang. And not just usage conventions but English itself changes over time; if it didn't, we'd all still be talking like Chaucer. Who's to say which changes are natural and which are corruptions? And when Bryan Garner or E. Ward Gilman do in fact presume to say, why should we believe them?\n\nThese sorts of questions are not new, but they do now have a certain urgency. America is in the midst of a protracted Crisis of Authority in matters of language. In brief, the same sorts of political upheavals that produced everything from Kent State to Independent Counsels have produced an influential contra-SNOOT school for whom normative standards of English grammar and usage are functions of nothing but custom and superstition and the ovine docility of a populace that lets self-appointed language authorities boss them around. See for example MIT's Steven Pinker in a famous New Republic article \u2014 \"Once introduced, a prescriptive rule is very hard to eradicate, no matter how ridiculous. Inside the writing establishment, the rules survive by the same dynamic that perpetuates ritual genital mutilations\" \u2014 or, at a somewhat lower pitch, Bill Bryson in Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way:\n\nWho sets down all those rules that we all know\nabout from childhood: the idea that we must never\nend a sentence with a preposition or begin one with\na conjunction, that we must use \"each other\" for two\nthings and \"one another\" for more than two ...? The\nanswer, surprisingly often, is that no one does,\nthat when you look into the background of these\n\"rules\" there is often little basis for them.\n\nIn ADMAU's Preface, Garner himself addresses the Authority Question with a Trumanesque simplicity and candor that simultaneously disguise the author's cunning and exemplify it:\n\nAs you might already suspect, I don't shy away\nfrom making judgments. I can't imagine that most\nreaders would want me to. Linguists don't like it,\nof course, because judgment involves subjectivity.[12]\nIt isn't scientific. But rhetoric and usage, in the view\nof most professional writers, aren't scientific endeavors.\nYou don't want dispassionate descriptions; you want\nsound guidance. And that requires judgment.\n\nWhole monographs could be written just on the masterful rhetoric of this passage. Note for example the ingenious equivocation of judgment in \"I don't shy away from making judgments\" vs. \"And that requires judgment.\" Suffice it to say that Garner is at all times keenly aware of the Authority Crisis in modern usage; and his response to this crisis is in the best Democratic Spirit rhetorical.\n\nSo ...\n\nCOROLLARY TO THESIS STATEMENT FOR WHOLE ARTICLE\n\nThe most salient and timely feature of Garner's book is that it's both lexicographical and rhetorical. Its main strategy involves what is known in classical rhetoric as the Ethical Appeal. Here the adjective, derived from the Greek ethos, doesn't mean quite what we usually mean by ethical. But there are affinities. What the Ethical Appeal amounts to is a complex and sophisticated \"Trust me.\" It's the boldest, most ambitious, and also most distinctively American of rhetorical Appeals, because it requires the rhetor to convince us not just of his intellectual acuity or technical competence but of his basic decency and fairness and sensitivity to the audience's own hopes and fears.[13]\n\nThese are not qualities one associates with the traditional SNOOT usage-authority, a figure who pretty much instantiates snobbishness and bow-tied anality, and one whose modern image is not improved by stuff like American Heritage Dictionary Distinguished Usage Panelist Morris Bishop's \"The arrant solecisms of the ignoramus are here often omitted entirely, `irregardless' of how he may feel about this neglect\" or critic John Simon's \"The English language is being treated nowadays exactly as slave traders once handled their merchandise....\" Compare those lines' authorial personas with Garner's in, e.g., \"English usage is so challenging that even experienced writers need guidance now and then.\"\n\nThe thrust here is going to be that A Dictionary of Modern American Usage earns Garner pretty much all the trust his Ethical Appeal asks us for. The book's \"feel-good\" spirit (in the very best sense of \"feel-good\") marries rigor and humility in such a way as to allow Garner to be extremely prescriptive without any appearance of evangelism or elitist putdown. This is an extraordinary accomplishment. Understanding why it's basically a rhetorical accomplishment, and why this is both historically significant and (in this reviewer's opinion) politically redemptive, requires a more detailed look at the Usage Wars.\n\nYou'd sure know lexicography had an underbelly if you read the little introductory essays in modern dictionaries \u2014 pieces like Webster's DEU's \"A Brief History of English Usage\" or Webster's Third's \"Linguistic Advances and Lexicography\" or AHD-3's \"Usage in the American Heritage Dictionary: The Place of Criticism.\" But almost nobody ever bothers with these little intros, and it's not just their six-point type or the fact that dictionaries tend to be hard on the lap. It's that these intros aren't actually written for you or me or the average citizen who goes to The Dictionary just to see how to spell (for instance) meringue. They're written for other lexicographers and critics, and in fact they're not really introductory at all but polemical. They're salvos in the Usage Wars that have been under way ever since editor Philip Gove first sought to apply the value-neutral principles of structural linguistics to lexicography in Webster's Third. Gove's famous response to conservatives who howled[14] when Webster's Third endorsed OK and described ain't as \"used orally in most parts of the U.S. by many cultivated speakers [sic]\" was this: \"A dictionary should have no traffic with ... artificial notions of correctness or superiority. It should be descriptive and not prescriptive.\" These terms stuck and turned epithetic, and linguistic conservatives are now formally known as Prescriptivists and linguistic liberals as Descriptivists.\n\nThe former are far better known. When you read the columns of William Safire or Morton Freeman or books like Edwin Newman's Strictly Speaking or John Simon's Paradigms Lost, you're actually reading Popular Prescriptivism, a genre sideline of certain journalists (mostly older ones, the vast majority of whom actually do wear bow ties) whose bemused irony often masks a Colonel Blimp's rage at the way the beloved English of their youth is being trashed in the decadent present. The plutocratic tone and styptic wit of Safire and Newman and the best of the Prescriptivists is often modeled after the mandarin-Brit personas of Eric Partridge and H. W. Fowler, the same Twin Towers of scholarly Prescriptivism whom Garner talks about revering as a kid.[15]\n\nDescriptivists, on the other hand, don't have weekly columns in the Times. These guys tend to be hard-core academics, mostly linguists or Comp theorists. Loosely organized under the banner of structural (or \"descriptive\") linguistics, they are doctrinaire positivists who have their intellectual roots in the work of Auguste Comte and Ferdinand de Saussure and their ideological roots firmly in the U.S. sixties. The brief explicit mention Garner's Preface gives this crew \u2014\n\nSomewhere along the line, though, usage dictionaries\ngot hijacked by the descriptive linguists.[16] who observe\nlanguage scientifically. For the pure descriptivist, it's\nimpermissible to say that one form of language is\nany better than another: as long as a native speaker\nsays it, it's OK \u2014 and anyone who takes a contrary\nstand is a dunderhead.... Essentially, descriptivists and\nprescriptivists are approaching different problems.\nDescriptivists want to record language as it's actually\nused, and they perform a useful function \u2014 though\ntheir audience is generally limited to those willing to pore\nthrough vast tomes of dry-as-dust research.\n\n\u2014 is disingenuous in the extreme, especially the \"approaching different problems\" part, because it vastly underplays the Descriptivists' influence on U.S. culture. For one thing, Descriptivism so quickly and thoroughly took over English education in this country that just about everybody who started junior high after c. 1970 has been taught to write Descriptively \u2014 via \"freewriting,\" \"brainstorming,\" \"journaling,\" a view of writing as self-exploratory and -expressive rather than as communicative, an abandonment of systematic grammar, usage, semantics, rhetoric, etymology. For another thing, the very language in which today's socialist, feminist, minority, gay, and environmentalist movements frame their sides of political debates is informed by the Descriptivist belief that traditional English is conceived and perpetuated by Privileged WASP Males[17] and is thus inherently capitalist, sexist, racist, xenophobic, homophobic, elitist: unfair. Think Ebonics. Think of the involved contortions people undergo to avoid he as a generic pronoun, or of the tense deliberate way white males now adjust their vocabularies around non-w.m.'s. Think of today's endless battles over just the names of things \u2014 \"Affirmative Action\" vs. \"Reverse Discrimination,\" \"Pro-Life\" vs. \"Pro-Choice,\" \"Undercount\" vs. \"Vote Fraud,\" etc.\n\nThe Descriptivist revolution takes a little time to unpack, but it's worth it. The structural linguists' rejection of conventional usage rules depends on two main arguments. The first is academic and methodological. In this age of technology, Descriptivists contend, it's the Scientific Method \u2014 clinically objective, value-neutral, based on direct observation and demonstrable hypothesis \u2014 that should determine both the content of dictionaries and the standards of \"correct\" English. Because language is constantly evolving, such standards will always be fluid. Gore's now classic introduction to Webster's Third outlines this type of Descriptivism's five basic edicts:\n\n\"1 \u2014 Language changes constantly;\n\n2 \u2014 Change is normal;\n\n3 \u2014 Spoken language is the language;\n\n4 \u2014 Correctness rests upon usage;\n\n5 \u2014 All usage is relative.\"\n\nThese principles look prima facie OK \u2014 commonsensical and couched in the bland simple s.-v.-o, prose of dispassionate Science \u2014 but in fact they're vague and muddled and it takes about three seconds to think of reasonable replies to each one of them, viz.:\n\n1 \u2014 OK, but how much and how fast?\n\n2 \u2014 Same thing. Is Heraclitean flux as normal or desirable as gradual change ? Do some changes actually serve the language's overall pizzazz better than others? And how many people have to deviate from how many conventions before we say the language has actually changed? Fifty percent? Ten percent?\n\n3 \u2014 This is an old claim, at least as old as Plato's Phaedrus. And it's specious. If Derrida and the infamous Deconstructionists have done nothing else, they've debunked the idea that speech is language's primary instantiation.[18] Plus consider the weird arrogance of Gove's (3) w/r/t correctness. Only the most mullahlike Prescriptivists care very much about spoken English; most Prescriptive usage guides concern Standard Written English.[19]\n\n4 \u2014 Fine, but whose usage? Gove's (4) begs the whole question. What he wants to imply here, I think, is a reversal of the traditional entailment-relation between abstract rules and concrete usage: Instead of usage ideally corresponding to a rigid set of regulations, the regulations ought to correspond to the way real people are actually using the language. Again, fine, but which people? Urban Latinos? Boston Brahmins? Rural Midwesterners? Appalachian Neogaelics?\n\n5 \u2014 Huh? If this means what it seems to mean, then it ends up biting Gove's whole argument in the ass. (5) appears to imply that the correct answer to the above \"which people?\" is: \"All of them!\" And it's easy to show why this will not stand up as a lexicographical principle. The most obvious problem with it is that not everything can go in The Dictionary. Why not? Because you can't observe every last bit of every last native speaker's \"language behavior,\" and even if you could, the resultant dictionary would weigh 4 million pounds and have to be updated hourly.[20] The fact is that any lexicographer is going to have to make choices about what gets in and what doesn't. And these choices are based on ... what? And now we're right back where we started.\n\nIt is true that, as a SNOOT, I am probably neurologically predisposed to look for flaws in Gove et al.'s methodological argument. But these flaws seem awfully easy to find. Probably the biggest one is that the Descriptivists' \"scientific lexicography\" \u2014 under which, keep in mind, the ideal English dictionary is basically number-crunching; you somehow observe every linguistic act by every native/naturalized speaker of English and put the sum of all these acts between two covers and call it The Dictionary \u2014 involves an incredibly simplistic and outdated understanding of what \"scientific\" means. It requires a naive belief in scientific objectivity, for one thing. Even in the physical sciences, everything from quantum mechanics to Information Theory has shown that an act of observation is itself part of the phenomenon observed and is analytically inseparable from it.\n\nIf you remember your old college English classes, there's an analogy here that points up the trouble scholars get into when they confuse observation with interpretation. Recall the New Critics.[21] They believed that literary criticism was best conceived as a \"scientific\" endeavor: The critic was a neutral, careful, unbiased, highly trained observer whose job was to find and objectively describe meanings that were right there \u2014 literally inside \u2014 pieces of literature. Whether you know what happened to the New Criticism's reputation depends on whether you took college English after c. 1975; suffice it to say that its star bas dimmed. The New Critics had the same basic problem as Gove's Methodological Descriptivists: They believed that scientific meant the same thing as neutral or unbiased. And that linguistic meanings could exist \"objectively,\" separate from any interpretive act.\n\nThe point of the analogy is that claims to objectivity in language study are now the stuff of jokes and shudders. The epistemological assumptions that underlie Methodological Descriptivism have been thoroughly debunked and displaced \u2014 n Lit by the rise of post-structuralism, Reader-Response Criticism, and Jaussian Reception Theory; in linguistics by the rise of Pragmatics \u2014 and it's now pretty much universally accepted that (a) meaning is inseparable from some act of interpretation and (b) an act of interpretation is always somewhat biased, i.e., informed by the interpreter's particular ideology. And the consequence of (a) and (b) is that there's no way around it \u2014 decisions about what to put in The Dictionary and what to exclude are going to be based on a lexicographer's ideology. And every lexicographer's got one. To presume that dictionary-making can somehow avoid or transcend ideology is simply to subscribe to a particular ideology, one that might aptly be called Unbelievably Naive Positivism.\n\nThere's an even more important way Descriptivists are wrong in thinking that the Scientific Method is appropriate to the study of language:\n\nEven if, as a thought experiment, we assume a kind of nineteenth-century scientific realism-in which, even though some scientists' interpretations of natural phenomena might be biased[22] the natural phenomena themselves can be supposed to exist wholly independent of either observation or interpretation \u2014 no such realist supposition can be made about \"language behavior,\" because this behavior is both human and fundamentally normative. To understand this, you have only to accept the proposition that language is by its very nature public \u2014 i.e., that there can be no such thing as a Private Language[23] and then to observe the way Methodological Descriptivists seem either ignorant of this fact or oblivious to its consequences, as in for example one Charles Fries's introduction to an epigone of Webster's Third called The American College Dictionary:\n\nA dictionary can be an \"authority\" only in the\nsense in which a book of chemistry or of physics\nor of botany can be an \"authority\": by the accuracy\nand the completeness of its record of the observed\nfacts of the field examined, in accord with the latest\nprinciples and techniques of the particular science.\n\nThis is so stupid it practically drools. An \"authoritative\" physics text presents the results of physicists' observations and physicists' theories about those observations. If a physics textbook operated on Descriptivist principles, the fact that some Americans believe that electricity flows better downhill (based on the observed fact that power lines tend to run high above the homes they serve) would require the Electricity Flows Better Downhill Theory to be included as a \"valid\" theory in the textbook \u2014 just as, for Dr. Fries, if some Americans use infer for imply, the use becomes an ipso facto \"valid\" part of the language. Structural linguists like Gove and Fries are not, finally, scientists but census-takers who happen to misconstrue the importance of \"observed facts.\" It isn't scientific phenomena they're tabulating but rather a set of human behaviors, and a lot of human behaviors are \u2014 to be blunt \u2014 moronic. Try, for instance, to imagine an \"authoritative\" ethics textbook whose principles were based on what most people actually do.\n\nNorm-wise, let's keep in mind that language didn't come into being because our hairy ancestors were sitting around the veldt with nothing better to do. Language was invented to serve certain specific purposes:[24] \"That mushroom is poisonous\"; \"Knock these two rocks together and you can start a fire\"; \"This shelter is mine!\" And so on. Clearly, as linguistic communities evolve over time, they discover that some ways of using language are \"better\" than others \u2014 meaning better with respect to the community's purposes. If we assume that one such purpose might be communicating which kinds of food are safe to eat, then you can see how, for example, a misplaced modifier might violate an important norm:\n\n\"People who eat that kind of mushroom often get sick\" confuses the recipient about whether he'll get sick only if he eats the mushroom frequently or whether he stands a good chance of getting sick the very first time he eats it. In other words, the community has a vested practical interest in excluding this kind of misplaced modifier from acceptable usage; and even if a certain percentage of tribesmen screw up and use them, this still doesn't make m.m.'s a good idea.\n\nMaybe now the analogy between usage and ethics is clearer. Just because people sometimes lie, cheat on their taxes, or scream at their kids, this doesn't mean that they think those things are \"good.\" The whole point of norms is to help us evaluate our actions (including utterances) according to what we as a community have decided our real interests and purposes are. Granted, this analysis is oversimplified; in practice it's incredibly hard to arrive at norms and to keep them at least minimally fair or sometimes even to agree on what they are (q.v. today's Culture Wars). But the Descriptivists' assumption that all usage norms are arbitrary and dispensable leads to \u2014 well, have a mushroom.\n\nThe connotations of arbitrary here are tricky, though, and this sort of segues into the second argument Descriptivists make. There is a sense in which specific linguistic conventions are arbitrary. For instance, there's no particular metaphysical reason why our word for a four-legged mammal that gives milk and goes Moo is cow and not, say, prtlmpf. The uptown phrase for this is \"the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign,\" and it's used, along with certain principles of cognitive science and generative grammar, in a more philosophically sophisticated version of Descriptivism that holds the conventions of SWE to be more like the niceties of fashion than like actual norms. This \"Philosophical Descriptivism\" doesn't care much about dictionaries or method; its target is the standard SNOOT claim supra \u2014 that prescriptive rules have their ultimate justification in the community's need to make its language meaningful.\n\nThe argument goes like this. An English sentence's being meaningful is not the same as its being grammatical. That is, such clearly ill-formed constructions as \"Did you seen the car keys of me?\" or \"The show was looked by many people\" are nevertheless comprehensible; the sentences do, more or less, communicate the information they're trying to get across. Add to this the fact that nobody who isn't damaged in some profound Oliver Sacksish way actually ever makes these sorts of very deep syntactic errors[25] and you get the basic proposition of Noam Chomsky's generative linguistics, which is that there exists a Universal Grammar beneath and common to all languages, plus that there is probably an actual part of the human brain that's imprinted with this Universal Grammar the same way birds' brains are imprinted with Fly South and dogs' with Sniff Genitals. There's all kinds of compelling evidence and support for these ideas, not least of which are the advances that linguists and cognitive scientists and A.I. researchers have been able to make with them, and the theories have a lot of credibility, and they are adduced by the Philosophical Descriptivists to show that since the really important rules of language are at birth already hardwired into people's neocortex; SWE prescriptions against dangling participles or mixed metaphors are basically the linguistic equivalent of whalebone corsets and short forks for salad. As Descriptivist Steven Pinker puts it, \"When a scientist considers all the high-tech mental machinery needed to order words into everyday sentences, prescriptive rules are, at best, inconsequential decorations.\"\n\nThis argument is not the barrel of drugged trout that Methodological Descriptivism was, but it's still vulnerable to some objections. The first one is easy. Even if it's true that we're all wired with a Universal Grammar, it simply doesn't follow that all prescriptive rules are superfluous. Some of these rules really do seem to serve clarity, and precision. The injunction against twoway adverbs (\"People who eat this often get sick\") is an obvious example, as are rules about other kinds of misplaced modifiers (\"There are many reasons why lawyers lie, some better than others\") and about relative pronouns' proximity to the nouns they modify (\"She's the mother of an infant daughter who works twelve hours a day\").\n\nGranted the Philosophical Descriptivist can question just how absolutely necessary these rules are, it's quite likely that a recipient of clauses like the above could figure out what the sentences mean from the sentences on either side or from the \"overall context\" or whatever. A listener can usually figure out what I really mean when I misuse infer for imply or say indicate for say, too. But many of these solecisms require at least a couple extra nanoseconds of cognitive effort, a kind of rapid sift-and-discard process, before the recipient gets it. Extra work. It's debatable just how much extra work, but it seems indisputable that we put some extra neural burden on the recipient when we fail to follow certain conventions. W/r/t confusing clauses like the above, it simply seems more \"considerate\" to follow the rules of correct SWE ... just as it's more \"considerate\" to de-slob your home before entertaining guests or to brush your teeth before picking up a date. Not just more considerate but more respectful somehow \u2014 both of your listener and of what you're trying to get across. As we sometimes also say about elements of fashion and etiquette, the way you use English \"Makes a Statement\" or \"Sends a Message\" \u2014 even though these Statements/Messages often have nothing to do with the actual information you're trying to transmit.\n\nWe've now sort of bled into a more serious rejoinder to Philosophical Descriptivism: From the fact that linguistic communication is not strictly dependent on usage and grammar it does not necessarily follow that the traditional rules of usage and grammar are nothing but \"inconsequential decorations.\" Another way to state the objection is that just because something is \"decorative\" does not necessarily make it \"inconsequential.\" Rhetorically, Pinker's flip dismissal is bad tactics, for it invites the very question it begs: inconsequential to whom?\n\nTake, for example, the Descriptivism claim that so-called correct English usages such as brought rather than brung and felt rather than feeled are arbitrary and restrictive and unfair and are supported only by custom and are (like irregular verbs in general) archaic and incommodious and an all-around pain in the ass. Let us concede for the moment that these objections are 100 percent reasonable. Then let's talk about pants. Trousers, slacks. I suggest to you that having the \"correct\" subthoracic clothing for U.S. males be pants instead of skirts is arbitrary (lots of other cultures let men wear skirts), restrictive and unfair (U.S. females get to wear pants), based solely on archaic custom (I think it's got something to do with certain traditions about gender and leg position, the same reasons girls' bikes don't have a crossbar), and in certain ways not only incommodious but illogical (skirts are more comfortable than pants; pants ride up; pants are hot; pants can squish the genitals and reduce fertility; over time pants chafe and erode irregular sections of men's leg hair and give older men hideous half-denuded legs, etc. etc.). Let us grant \u2014 as a thought experiment if nothing else \u2014 that these are all reasonable and compelling objections to pants as an androsartorial norm. Let us in fact in our minds and hearts say yes \u2014 shout yes \u2014 to the skirt, the kilt, the toga, the sarong, the jupe. Let us dream of or even in our spare time work toward an America where nobody lays any arbitrary sumptuary prescriptions on anyone else and we can all go around as comfortable and aerated and unchafed and unsquished and motile as we want.\n\nAnd yet the fact remains that, in the broad cultural mainstream of millennial America, men do not wear skirts. If you, the reader, are a U.S. male, and even if you share my personal objections to pants and dream as I do of a cool and genitally unsquishy American Tomorrow, the odds are still 99.9 percent that in 100 percent of public situations you wear pants/slacks/shorts/trunks. More to the point, if you are a U.S. male and also have a U.S. male child, and if that child were to come to you one evening and announce his desire/intention to wear a skirt rather than pants to school the next day, I am 100-percent confident that you are going to discourage him from doing so. Strongly discourage him. You could be a Molotov-tossing anti-pants radical or a kilt manufacturer or Steven Pinker himself \u2014 you're going to stand over your kid and be prescriptive about an arbitrary, archaic, uncomfortable, and inconsequentially decorative piece of clothing. Why? Well, because in modern America any little boy who comes to school in a skirt (even, say, a modest all-season midi) is going to get stared at and shunned and beaten up and called a Total Geekoid by a whole lot of people whose approval and acceptance are important to him.[26] In our culture, in other words, a boy who wears a skirt is Making a Statement that is going to have all kinds of gruesome social and emotional consequences.\n\nYou see where this is going. I'm going to describe the intended point of the pants analogy in terms I'm sure are simplistic \u2014 doubtless there are whole books in Pragmatics or psycholinguistics or something devoted to unpacking this point. The weird thing is that I've seen neither Descriptivists nor SNOTs deploy it in the Wars.[27]\n\nWhen I say or write something, there are actually a whole lot of different things I am communicating. The propositional content (the actual information I'm trying to convey) is only one part of it. Another part is stuff about me, the communicator. Everyone knows this. It's a function of the fact that there are uncountably many well-formed ways to say the same basic thing, from e.g. \"I was attacked by a bear!\" to \"Goddamn bear tried to kill me!\" to \"That ursine juggernaut bethought to sup upon my person!\" and so on. And different levels of diction and formality are only the simplest kinds of distinction; things get way more complicated in the sorts of interpersonal communication where social relations and feelings and moods come into play. Here's a familiar sort of example. Suppose that you and I are acquaintances and we're in my apartment having a conversation and that at some point I want to terminate the conversation and not have you be in my apartment anymore. Very delicate social moment. Think of all the different ways I can try to handle it: \"Wow, look at the time\"; \"Could we finish this up later?\"; \"Could you please leave now?\"; \"Go\"; \"Get out\"; \"Get the hell out of here\"; \"Didn't you say you had to be someplace?\"; \"Time for you to hit the dusty trail, my friend\"; \"Off you go then, love\"; or that sly old telephone-conversation ender: \"Well, I'm going to let you go now\"; etc. And then think of all the different factors and implications of each option.\n\nThe point here is obvious. It concerns a phenomenon that SNOOTS blindly reinforce and that Descriptivists badly underestimate and that scary vocab-tape ads try to exploit. People really do \"judge\" one another according to their use of language. Constantly. Of course, people judge one another on the basis of all kinds of things \u2014 weight, scent, physiognomy, occupation, make of vehicle[28] \u2014 and, again, doubtless it's all terribly complicated and occupies whole battalions of sociolinguists. But it's clear that at least one component of all this interpersonal semantic judging involves acceptance, meaning not some touchy-feely emotional affirmation but actual acceptance or rejection of somebody's bid to be regarded as a peer, a member of somebody else's collective or community or Group. Another way to come at this is to acknowledge something that in the Usage Wars gets mentioned only in very abstract terms: \"Correct\" English usage is, as a practical matter, a function of whom you're talking to and how you want that person to respond \u2014 not just to your utterance but also to you. In other words, a large part of the agenda of any communication is rhetorical and depends on what some rhet-scholars call \"Audience\" or \"Discourse Community.\"[29] And the United States obviously has a huge number of such Discourse Communities, many of them regional and/or cultural dialects of English: Black English, Latino English, Rural Southern, Urban Southern, Standard Upper-Midwest, Maine Yankee, East-Texas Bayou, Boston BlueCollar, on and on. Everybody knows this. What not everyone knows \u2014 especially not certain Prescriptivists \u2014 is that many of these non-SWE dialects have their own highly developed and internally consistent grammars, and that some of these dialects' usage norms actually make more linguistic/aesthetic sense than do their Standard counterparts (see INTERPOLATION). Plus, of course, there are innumerable sub- and subsubdialects based on all sorts of things that have nothing to do with locale or ethnicity \u2014 Medical-School English, Peorians-Who-Follow-Pro-Wrestling-Closely English, Twelve-Year-Old-Males-Whose-Worldview-Is-Deeply-Informed-By-South-Park English \u2014 and that are nearly incomprehensible to anyone who isn't inside their very tight and specific Discourse Community (which of course is part of their function[30]).\n\nINTERPOLATION: EXAMPLE OF GRAMMATICAL ADVANTAGES OF A NON-STANDARD DIALECT THAT THIS REVIEWER ACTUALLY KNOWS ABOUT FIRSTHAND\n\nThis rev. happens to have two native English dialects \u2014 the SWE of my hypereducated parents and the hard-earned Rural Midwestern of most of my peers. When I'm talking to R.M.'s, I usually use, for example, the construction \"Where's it at?\" instead of \"Where is it?\" Part of this is a naked desire to fit in and not get rejected as an egghead or fag (see sub). But another part is that I, SNOOT or no, believe that this and other R.M.isms are in certain ways superior to their Standard equivalents.\n\nFor a dogmatic Prescriptivist, \"Where's it at?\" is double-damned as a sentence that not only ends with a preposition but whose final preposition forms a redundancy with where that's similar to the redundancy in \"the reason is because\" (which latter usage I'll admit makes me dig my nails into my palms). Rejoinder: First off, the avoid-terminal-prepositions rule is the invention of one Fr. R. Lowth, an eighteenth-century British preacher and indurate pedant who did things like spend scores of pages arguing for hath over the trendy and degenerate has. The a.-t.-p. rule is antiquated and stupid and only the most ayatolloid SNOOT takes it seriously. Garner himself calls the rule \"stuffy\" and lists all kinds of useful constructions like \"the man you were listening to\" that we'd have to discard or distort if we really enforced it.\n\nPlus the apparent redundancy of \"Where's it at?\" [31] is offset by its metrical logic. What the at really does is license the contraction of is after the interrogative adverb. You can't say \"Where's it?\" So the choice is between \"Where is it?\" and \"Where's it at?\", and the latter, a strong anapest, is prettier and trips off the tongue better than \"Where is it?\", whose meter is either a clunky monosyllabic foot + trochee or it's nothing at all.\n\nThis is probably the place for your SNOOT reviewer openly to concede that a certain number of traditional prescriptive rules really are stupid and that people who insist on them (like the legendary assistant to PM. Margaret Thatcher who refused to read any memo with a split infinitive in it, or the jr.-high teacher I had who automatically graded you down if you started a sentence with Hopefully) are that very most pathetic and dangerous sort of SNOOT, the SNOOT Who Is Wrong. The injunction against split infinitives, for instance, is a consequence of the weird fact that English grammar is modeled on Latin even though Latin is a synthetic language and English is an analytic language. [32] Latin infinitives consist of one word and are impossible to as it were split, and the earliest English Prescriptivists \u2014 so enthralled with Latin that their English usage guides were actually written in Latin [33] \u2014 decided that English infinitives shouldn't be split either. Garner himself takes out after the s.i. rule in both SPLIT INFINITIVES and SUPERSTITIONS. [34] And Hopefully at the beginning of a sentence, as a certain cheeky eighth-grader once pointed out to his everlasting social cost, actually functions not as a misplaced modal auxiliary or as a manner adverb like quickly or angrily but as a \"sentence adverb\" that indicates the speaker's attitude about the state of affairs described by the sentence (examples of perfectly OK sentence adverbs are Clearly, Basically, Luckily), and only SNOOTs educated in the high-pedantic years up to 1960 blindly proscribe it or grade it down.\n\nThe cases of split infinitives and Hopefully are in fact often trotted out by dogmatic Descriptivists as evidence that all SWE usage rules are arbitrary and stupid (which is a bit like pointing to Pat Buchanan as evidence that all Republicans are maniacs). Garner rejects Hopefully's knee-jerk proscription, too, albeit grudgingly, including the adverb in his miniessay on SKUNKED TERMS, which is his phrase for a usage that is \"hotly disputed.., any use of it is likely to distract some readers.\" (Garner also points out something I'd never quite realized, which is that hopefully, if misplaced/mispunctuated in the body of a sentence, can create some of the same two-way ambiguities as other adverbs, as in the clause \"I will borrow your book and hopefully read it soon.\")\n\nWhether we're conscious of it or or, most of us are fluent in more than one major English dialect and in a large number of subdialects and are probably at least passable in countless others. Which dialect you choose to use depends, of course, on whom you're addressing. More to the point, I submit that the dialect you use depends mostly on what sort of Group your listener is part of and whether you wish to present yourself as a fellow member of that Group. An obvious example is that traditional upper-class English has certain dialectal differences from lower-class English and that schools used to have courses in Elocution whose whole point was to teach people how to speak in an upper-class way. But usage-as-inclusion is about much more than class. Here's another thought experiment: A bunch of U.S. teenagers in clothes that look far too large for them are sitting together in the local mall's Food Court, and a 53-year-old man with a combover and clothes that fit comes over to them and says that he was scoping them and thinks they're totally rad and/or phat and is it cool if he just kicks it and does the hang here with them. The kids' reaction is going to be either scorn or embarrassment for the guy \u2014 most likely a mix of both. Q: Why? Or imagine that two hard-core urban black guys are standing there talking and I, who am resoundingly and in all ways white, come up and greet them with \"Yo\" and call them \"Brothers\" and ask \"s'up, s'goin on,\" pronouncing on with that NYCish oo-o diphthong that Young Urban Black English deploys for a standard o. Either these guys are going to be offended or they are going to think I am simply out of my mind. No other reaction is remotely foreseeable. Q: Why?\n\nWhy: A dialect of English is learned and used either because it's your native vernacular or because it's the dialect of a Group by which you wish (with some degree of plausibility) to be accepted. And although it is the major and arguably the most important one, SWE is only one dialect. And it is never, or at least hardly ever, anybody's only dialect. This is because there are \u2014 as you and I both know and yet no one in the Usage Wars ever seems to mention \u2014 situations in which faultlessly correct SWE is clearly not the appropriate dialect.\n\nChildhood is full of such situations. This is one reason why SNOOTlets tend to have a very hard social time of it in school. A SNOOTlet is a little kid who's wildly, precociously fluent in SWE (he is often, recall, the offspring of SNOOTs). Just about every class has a SNOOTlet, so I know you've seen them \u2014 these are the sorts of six- to twelve-year-olds who use whom correctly and whose response to striking out in T-ball is to cry out \"How incalculably dreadful!\" etc. The elementary-school SNOOTlet is one of the earliest identifiable species of academic Geekoid and is duly despised by his peers and praised by his teachers. These teachers usually don't see the incredible amounts of punishment the SNOOTlet is receiving from his classmates, or if they do see it they blame the classmates and shake their heads sadly at the vicious and arbitrary cruelty of which children are capable.\n\nBut the other children's punishment of the SNOOTIet is not arbitrary at all. There are important things at stake. Little kids in school are learning about Group-inclusion and -exclusion and about the respective rewards and penalties of same and about the use of dialect and syntax and slang as signals of affinity and inclusion. [35] They're learning about Discourse Communities. Kids learn this stuff not in English or Social Studies but on the playground and at lunch and on the bus. When his peers are giving the SNOOTlet monstrous quadruple Wedgies or holding him down and taking turns spitting on him, there's serious learning going on ... for everyone except the little SNOOT, who in fact is being punished for precisely his failure to learn. What neither he nor his teacher realizes is that the SNOOTlet is deficient in Language Arts. He has only one dialect. He cannot alter his vocabulary, usage, or grammar, cannot use slang or vulgarity; and it's these abilities that are really required for \"peer rapport,\" which is just a fancy Elementary-Ed term for being accepted by the most important Group in the little kid's life.\n\nThis reviewer acknowledges that there seems to be some, umm, personal stuff getting dredged up and worked out here;[36] but the stuff is relevant. The point is that the little A+ SNOOTlet is actually in the same dialectal position as the class's \"slow\" kid who can't learn to stop using ain't or bringed. One is punished in class, the other on the playground, but both are deficient in the same linguistic skill \u2014 viz., the ability to move between various dialects and levels of \"correctness,\" the ability to communicate one way with peers and another way with teachers and another with family and another with Little League coaches and so on. Most of these dialectal adjustments are made below the level of conscious awareness, and our ability to make them seems part psychological and part something else \u2014 perhaps something hardwired into the same motherboard as Universal Grammar \u2014 and in truth this ability is a far better indicator of a kid's \"Verbal I.Q.\" than test scores or grades, since U.S. English classes do far more to retard dialectal talent than to cultivate it.\n\nWell-known fact: In neither K-12 or college English are systematic WE grammar and usage much taught anymore. It's been this way for more than 20 years. The phenomenon drives Prescriptivists nuts, and it's one of the big things they cite as evidence of America's gradual murder of English. Descriptivists and English-Ed specialists counter that grammar and usage have been abandoned because scientific research proved that studying SWE grammar and usage simply doesn't help make kids better writers. Each side in the debate tends to regard the other as mentally ill or/and blinded by political ideology. Neither camp appears ever to have considered whether maybe the way prescriptive SWE was traditionally taught had something to do with its inutility.\n\nBy way here I'm referring not so much to actual method as to spirit or attitude. Most traditional teachers of English grammar have, of course, been dogmatic SNOOTs, and like most dogmatists they've been incredibly stupid about the rhetoric they used and the Audience they were addressing. [37] I refer specifically to their assumption that SWE is the sole appropriate English dialect and that the only reasons anyone could fail to see this are ignorance or amentia or grave deficiencies in character. As rhetoric, this sort of attitude works only in sermons to the Choir, and as pedagogy it's just disastrous. The reality is that an average U.S. student is going to go to the trouble of mastering the difficult conventions of SWE only if he sees SWE's relevant Group or Discourse Community as one he'd like to be part of. And in the absence of any sort of argument for why the correct-SWE Group is a good or desirable one (an argument that, recall, the traditional teacher hasn't given, because he's such a dogmatic SNOOT he sees no need to), the student is going to be reduced to evaluating the desirability of the SWE Group based on the one obvious member of the Group he's encountered, namely the SNOOTy teacher himself.\n\nI'm not suggesting here that an effective SWE pedagogy would require teachers to wear sunglasses and call students \"Dude.\" What I am suggesting is that the rhetorical situation of an English class \u2014 a class composed wholly of young people whose Group identity is rooted in defiance of Adult-Establishment values, plus also composed partly of minorities whose primary dialects are different from SWE \u2014 requires the teacher to come up with overt, honest, compelling arguments for why SWE is a dialect worth learning.\n\nThese arguments are hard to make \u2014 not intellectually but emotionally, politically. Because they are baldly elitist. [38] The real truth, of course, is that SWE is the dialect of the American elite. That it was invented, codified, and promulgated by Privileged WASP Males and is perpetuated as \"Standard\" by same. That it is the shibboleth of the Establishment and an instrument of political power and class division and racial discrimination and all manner of social inequity. These are shall we say rather delicate subjects to bring up in an English class, especially in the service of a pro-SWE argument, and extra-especially if you yourself are both a Privileged WASP Male and the Teacher and thus pretty much a walking symbol of the Adult Establishment. This reviewer's opinion, though, is that both students and SWE are better served if the teacher makes his premises explicit, licit and his argument overt, presenting himself as an advocate of SWE's utility rather than as a prophet of its innate superiority.\n\nBecause this argument is both most delicate and (I believe) most important with respect to students of color, here is one version of a spiel I've given in private conference [39] with certain black students who were (a) bright and inquisitive and (b) deficient in what U.S. higher education considers written English facility:\n\nI don't know whether anybody's told you this or not,\nbut when you're in a college English class you're basically\nstudying a foreign dialect. This dialect is called 'Standard\nWritten English. ... From talking with you and reading\nyour essays, I've concluded that your own primary dialect\nis [one of three variants of SBE common to our region]. Now,\nlet me spell something out in my official Teacher-voice:\nThe SBE you're fluent in is different from SWE in all kinds\nof important ways. Some of these differences are\ngrammatical \u2014 for example, double negatives are OK\nin Standard Black English but not in SWE, and SBE\nand SWE conjugate certain verbs in totally different\nways. Other differences have more to do with style \u2014\nfor instance, Standard Written English tends to use a lot\nmore subordinate clauses in the early parts of sentences,\nand it sets off most of these early subordinates with commas,\nand, under SWE rules, writing that doesn't do this is \"choppy.\"\nThere are tons of differences like that. How much of this\nstuff do you already know?\n[STANDARD RESPONSE: some variation on \"I know from\nthe grades and comments on my papers that English profs\ndon't think I'm a good writer.\"]\nWell, I've got good news and bad news. There are some\notherwise smart English profs who aren't very aware that\nthere are real dialects of English other than SWE, so when\nthey're reading your papers they'll put, like, \"Incorrect\nconjugation\" or \"Comma needed\" instead of \"SWE\nconjugates this verb differently\" or \"SWE calls for a comma\nhere.\" That's the good news \u2014 it's not that you're a\nbad writer, it's that you haven't learned the special\nrules of the dialect they want you to write in. Maybe\nthat's not such good news, that they were grading you\ndown for mistakes in a foreign language you didn't even\nknow was a foreign language. That they won't let you write\nin SBE. Maybe it seems unfair. If it does, you're not going\nto like this news: I'm not going to let you write in SBE\neither. In my class, you have to learn and write in SWE.\nIf you want to study your own dialect and its rules and history\nand how it's different from SWE, fine \u2014 there are some\ngreat books by scholars of Black English, and I'll help you\nfind some and talk about them with you if you want. But\nthat will be outside class. In class \u2014 in my English class \u2014\nyou will have to master and write in Standard Written English,\nwhich we might just as well call \"Standard White English,\"\nbecause it was developed by white people and is used\nby white people, especially educated, powerful white people.\n[RESPONSES by this point vary too widely to standardize.]\nI'm respecting you enough here to give you what I believe is\nthe straight truth. In this country, SWE is perceived as the\ndialect of education and intelligence and power and prestige,\nand anybody of any race, ethnicity, religion, or gender\nwho wants to succeed in American culture has got to be able\nto use SWE. This is How It Is. You can be glad about it or sad\nabout it or deeply pissed off. You can believe it's racist and\nunjust and decide right here and now to spend every waking\nminute of your adult life arguing against it, and maybe you\nshould, but I'll tell you something: If you ever want those\narguments to get listened to and taken seriously, you're\ngoing to have to communicate them in SWE, because SWE is\nthe dialect our country uses to talk to itself. African\nAmericans who've become successful and important in\nU.S. culture know this; that's why King's and X's and\nJackson's speeches are in SWE, and why Morrison's and\nAngelou's and Baldwin's and Wideman's and West's books\nare full of totally ass-kicking SWE, and why black judges\nand politicians and journalists and doctors and teachers\ncommunicate professionally in SWE. Some of these people\ngrew up in homes and communities where SWE was the\nnative dialect, and these black people had it much easier\nin school, but the ones who didn't grow up with SWE\nrealized at some point that they had to learn it and\nbecome able to write in it, and so they did. And [INSERT\nNAME HERE], you're going to learn to use it, too, because\nI am going to make you.\n\nI should note here that a couple of the students I've said this stuff to were offended \u2014 one lodged an Official Complaint \u2014 and that I have had more than one colleague profess to find my spiel \"racially insensitive.\" Perhaps you do, too. My own humble opinion is that some of the cultural and political realities of American life are themselves racially insensitive and elitist and offensive and unfair, and that pussyfooting around these realities with euphemistic doublespeak is not only hypocritical but toxic to the project of ever actually changing them. Such pussyfooting has of course now achieved the status of a dialect \u2014 one powerful enough to have turned the normal politics of the Usage Wars sort of inside out.\n\nI refer here to Politically Correct English (PCE), under whose conventions failing students become \"high-potential\" students and poor people \"economically disadvantaged\" and people in wheelchairs \"differently abled\" and a sentence like \"White English and Black English are different and you better learn White English if you don't want to flunk\" is not blunt but \"insensitive.\" Although it's common to make jokes about PCE (referring to ugly people as \"aesthetically challenged\" and so on), be advised that Politically Correct English's various pre- and proscriptions are taken very seriously indeed by colleges and corporations and government agencies, whose own institutional dialects now evolve under the beady scrutiny of a whole new kind of Language Police.\n\nFrom one perspective, the history of PCE evinces a kind of Lenin-to-Stalinesque irony. That is, the same ideological principles that informed the original Descriptivist revolution \u2014 namely, the sixties-era rejections of traditional authority and traditional inequality \u2014 have now actually produced a far more inflexible Prescriptivism, one unencumbered by tradition or complexity and backed by the threat of real-world sanctions (termination, litigation) for those who fail to conform. This is sort of funny in a dark way, maybe, and most criticism of PCE seems to consist in making fun of its trendiness or vapidity. This reviewer's own opinion is that prescriptive PCE is not just silly but confused and dangerous.\n\nUsage is always political, of course, but it's complexly political. With respect, for instance, to political change, usage conventions can function in two ways: On the one hand they can be a reflection of political change, and on the other they can be an instrument of political change. These two functions are different and have to be kept straight. Confusing them \u2014 in particular, mistaking for political efficacy what is really just a language's political symbolism ... \u2014 enables the bizarre conviction that America ceases to be elitist or unfair simply because Americans stop using certain vocabulary that is historically associated with elitism and unfairness. This is PCE's central fallacy \u2014 that a society's mode of expression is productive of its attitudes rather than a product of those attitudes \u2014 and of course it's nothing but the obverse of the politically conservative SNOOT'S delusion that social change can be retarded by restricting change in standard usage. [40]\n\nForget Stalinization or Logic 101-level equivocations, though. There's a grosser irony about Politically Correct English. This is that PCE purports to be the dialect of progressive reform but is in fact \u2014 in its Orwellian substitution of the euphemisms of social equality for social equality itself \u2014 of vastly more help to conservatives and the U.S. status quo than traditional SNOOT prescriptions ever were. Were I, for instance, a political conservative who opposed taxation as a means of redistributing national wealth, I would be delighted to watch PCE progressives spend their time and energy arguing over whether a poor person should be described as \"low-income\" or \"economically disadvantaged\" or \"pre-prosperous\" rather than constructing effective public arguments for redistributive legislation or higher marginal tax rates on corporations. (Not to mention that strict codes of egalitarian euphemism serve to burke the sorts of painful, unpretty, and sometimes offensive discourse that in a pluralistic democracy leads to actual political change rather than symbolic political change. In other words, PCE functions as a form of censorship, and censorship always serves the status quo.)\n\nAs a practical matter, I strongly doubt whether a guy who has four small kids and makes $12,000 a year feels more empowered or less ill-used by a society that carefully refers to him as \"economically disadvantaged\" rather than \"poor.\" Were I he, in fact, I'd probably find the PCE term insulting \u2014 not just because it's patronizing but because it's hypocritical and self-serving. Like many forms of Vogue Usage,[41] PCE functions primarily to signal and congratulate certain virtues in the speaker \u2014 scrupulous egalitarianism, concern for the dignity of all people, sophistication about the political implications of language \u2014 and so serves the selfish interests of the PC far more than it serves any of the persons or groups renamed.\n\nINTERPOLATION ON A RELATED ISSUE IN THE FACE OF WHOSE GHASTLY MALIGNANCY THIS REVIEWER'S DEMOCRATIC SPIRIT JUST GIVES OUT ALTOGETHER, ADMITTEDLY\n\nThis issue is Academic English, a cancer that has metastasized now to afflict both scholarly writing \u2014\n\nIf such a sublime cyborg would insinuate the\nfuture as post-Fordist subject, his palpably\nmasochistic locations as ecstatic agent of the\nsublime superstate need to be decoded as\nthe \"now all-but-unreadable DNA\" of the fast\nindustrializing Detroit, just as his Robocop-like\nstrategy of carceral negotiation and street\ncontrol remains the tirelessly American one\nof inflicting regeneration through violence\nupon the racially heteroglassic wilds and others\nof the inner city.[42]\n\n\u2014 and prose as mainstream as The Village Voice's:\n\nAt first encounter, the poems' distanced\ncerebral surfaces can be daunting, evading\nphysical location or straightforward emotional\narc. But this seeming remoteness quickly\nreveals a very real passion, centered in the\nspeaker's struggle to define his evolving\nself-construction.\n\nMaybe it's a combination of my SNOOTitude and the fact that I end up having to read a lot of it for my job, but I'm afraid I regard Academic English not as a dialectal variation but as a grotesque debasement of SWE, and loathe it even more than the stilted incoherences of Presidential English (\"This is the best and only way to uncover, destroy, and prevent Iraq from reengineering weapons of mass destruction\") or the mangled pieties of BusinessSpeak (\"Our Mission: to proactively search and provide the optimum networking skills and resources to meet the needs of your growing business\"); and in support of this utter contempt and intolerance I cite no less an authority than Mr. G. Orwell, who 50 years ago had AE pegged as a \"mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence\" in which \"it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning.\"[43]\n\nIt probably isn't the whole explanation, but, as with the voguish hypocrisy of PCE, the obscurity and pretension of Academic English can be attributed in part to a disruption in the delicate rhetorical balance between language as a vector of meaning and language as a vector of the writer's own resume. In other words, it is when a scholar's vanity/insecurity leads him to write primarily to communicate and reinforce his own status as an Intellectual that his English is deformed by pleonasm and pretentious diction (whose function is to signal the writer's erudition) and by opaque abstraction (whose function is to keep anybody from pinning the writer down to a definite assertion that can maybe be refuted or shown to be silly). The latter characteristic, a level of obscurity that often makes it just about impossible to figure out what an AE sentence is really saying, so closely resembles political and corporate doublespeak (\"revenue enhancement,\" \"downsizing,\" pre-owned,\" \"proactive resource-allocation restructuring\") that it's tempting to think AE's real purpose is concealment and its real motivation fear.\n\nThe insecurity that drives AE, PCE, and vocab-tape ads is far from groundless, though. These are tense linguistic times. Blame it on Heisenbergian Uncertainty or postmodern relativism or Image Over Substance or the ubiquity of advertising and P.R. or the rise of Identity Politics or whatever you will \u2014 we live in an era of terrible preoccupation with presentation and interpretation. In rhetorical terms, certain long-held distinctions between the Ethical Appeal, Logical Appeal (= an argument's plausibility or soundness), and Pathetic Appeal (= an argument's emotional impact) have now pretty much collapsed \u2014 or rather the different sorts of Appeals now affect and are affected by one another in ways that make it almost impossible to advance an argument on \"reason\" alone.\n\nA vividly concrete illustration here concerns the Official Complaint a black undergraduate filed against this rev. after one of my little in camera spiels described on pages 53-54. The complainant was (I opine) wrong, but she was not crazy or stupid; and I was able later to see that I did bear some responsibility for the whole nasty administrative swivet. My culpability lay in gross rhetorical naivete. I'd seen my speech's primary Appeal as Logical: The aim was to make a conspicuously blunt, honest argument for SWE's utility. It wasn't pretty, maybe, but it was true, plus so manifestly bullshit-free that I think I anticipated not just acquiescence but gratitude for my candor. [44] The problem I failed to see, of course, lay not with the argument per se but with the person making it \u2014 namely me, a Privileged WASP Male in a position of power, thus someone whose statements about the primacy and utility of the Privileged WASP Male dialect appeared not candid/hortatory/ authoritative/true but elitist/high-handed/ authoritarian/racist. Rhetoric-wise what happened was that I allowed the substance and style of my Logical Appeal to completely torpedo my Ethical Appeal: What the student heard was just another PWM rationalizing why his Group and his English were top dog and ought \"logically\" to stay that way (plus, worse, trying to use his academic power over her to coerce her assent [45] ).\n\nIf for any reason you happen to find yourself sharing this particular student's perceptions and reaction, [46] I would ask that you bracket your feelings long enough to recognize that the PWM instructor's very modern rhetorical dilemma in that office was really no different from the dilemma faced by a male who makes a Pro-Life argument, or an atheist who argues against Creation Science, or a Caucasian who opposes Affirmative Action, or an African American who decries Racial Profiling, or anyone over eighteen who tries to make a case for raising the legal driving age to eighteen, etc. The dilemma has nothing to do with whether the arguments themselves are plausible or right or even sane, because the debate rarely gets that far \u2014 any opponent with sufficiently strong feelings or a dogmatic bent can discredit the arguments and pretty much foreclose all further discussion with a single, terribly familiar rejoinder: \"Of course you'd say that\"; \"Easy for you to say\"; \"What right do you have ...?\"\n\nNow (still bracketing) consider the situation of any reasonably intelligent and well-meaning SNOOT who sits down to prepare a prescriptive usage guide. It's the millennium, post-Everything: Whence the authority to make any sort of credible Appeal for SWE at all?\n\nARTICLE'S CRUX: WHY BRYAN A. GARNER IS A GENIUS, THOUGH OF A RATHER PARTICULAR KIND\n\nIt isn't that A Dictionary of Modern American Usage is perfect It doesn't seem to cover conversant in vs. conversant with, for example, or abstruse vs. obtuse, or to have anything on hereby and herewith (which I tend to use interchangeably but always have the uneasy feeling I'm screwing up). Garner's got a good discussion of used to but nothing on supposed to. Nor does he give any examples to help explain irregular participles and transitivity (\"The light shone\" vs. \"I shined the light,\" etc.), and these would seem to be more important than, say, the correct spelling of huzzah or the plural of animalculum, both of which get discussed. Plus there's the VOGUE WORDS snafu and the absence of a pronunciation entry on trough. [47] In other words, a SNOOT is going to be able to find stuff to quibble about in any usage dictionary, and ADMAU is no exception.\n\nBut it's still really, really good \u2014 and not just lexicographically but rhetorically, politically (if it even makes sense to distinguish these any more). As a collection of judgments, ADMAU is in no way Descriptivist, but Garner structures his judgments very carefully to avoid the elitism and anality of traditional SNOGTitude. He does not deploy irony or scorn or caustic wit, nor tropes or colloquialisms or contractions ... or really any sort of verbal style at all. In fact, even though Garner talks openly about himself and uses the 1-S pronoun throughout the whole dictionary, his personality is oddly effaced, neutralized. It's like he's so bland he's barely there. E.g., as this reviewer was finishing the book's final entry,[48] it struck me that I had no idea whether Bryan Garner was black or white, gay or straight, Democrat or Dittohead. What was even more striking was that I hadn't once wondered about any of this up to now; something about Garner's lexical persona kept me ever from asking where the guy was coming from or what particular agendas or ideologies were informing what he had admitted right up front were \"value judgments.\"\n\nBryan Garner is a genius because the Dictionary of Modern American Usage pretty much resolves the Usage Wars' Crisis of Authority. Garner manages to control the compresence of rhetorical Appeals so cleverly that he appears able to transcend both Usage Wars camps and simply tell the truth, and in a way that does not torpedo his own credibility but actually enhances it. His argumentative strategy is totally brilliant and totally sneaky, and part of both qualities is that it usually doesn't seem like there's even an argument going on at all.\n\nGarner recognizes something that neither of the dogmatic camps appears to get: Given 40 years of the Usage Wars, \"authority\" is no longer something a lexicographer can just presume ex officio. In fact, a large part of the project of any contemporary usage dictionary will consist in establishing this authority. If that seems rather obvious, be apprised that nobody before Garner seems to have figured it out \u2014 that the lexicographer's challenge now is to be not just accurate and comprehensive but credible. That in the absence of unquestioned Authority in language, the reader must now be moved or persuaded to grant a dictionary its authority, freely and for what appear to be good reasons.\n\nGarner's A Dictionary of Modern American Usage is thus both a collection of information and a piece of Democratic rhetoric.[49] Its goal is to recast the Prescriptivist's persona: The author presents himself as an authority not in an autocratic sense but in a technocratic sense. And the technocrat is not only a thoroughly modern and palatable image of Authority but also immune to the charges of elitism/classism that have hobbled traditional Prescriptivism.\n\nOf course, Garner really is a technocrat. He's a lawyer, recall, and in ADMAU he consciously projects a sort of wise juridical persona: knowledgeable, dispassionate, fair, with an almost Enlightenment-grade passion for reason. His judgments about usage tend to be rendered like legal opinions \u2014 exhaustive citation of precedent (other dictionaries' judgments, published examples of actual usage) combined with clear, logical reasoning that's always informed by the larger consensual purposes SWE is meant to serve.\n\nAlso thoroughgoingly technocratic is Garner's approach to the issue of whether anybody's even going to be interested in his 700 pages of fine-pointed counsel. Like any specialist, he simply presumes that there are practical reasons why some people choose to concern themselves with SWE usage; and his attitude about the fact that most Americans \"could care less\" isn't scorn or disapproval but the phlegmatic resignation of a doctor or lawyer who realizes that he can give good advice but can't make you take it:\n\nThe reality I care about most is that some people\nstill want to use the language well.[50] They\nwant to write effectively; they want to speak effectively.\nThey want their language to be graceful at times and\npowerful at times. They want to understand how to\nuse words well, how to manipulate sentences, and how\nto move about in the language without seeming to flail.\nThey want good grammar, but they want more: they\nwant rhetoric[51] in the traditional sense.\nThat is, they want to use the language deftly so that\nit's fit for their purposes.\n\nIt's now possible to see that all the autobiographical stuff in ADMAU's Preface does more than just humanize Mr. Bryan A. Garner. It also serves to detail the early and enduring passion that helps make someone a credible technocrat \u2014 we tend to like and trust experts whose expertise is born of a real love for their specialty instead of just a desire to be expert at something. In fact, it turns out that ADMAU's Preface quietly and steadily invests Garner with every single qualification of modern technocratic Authority: passionate devotion, reason, and accountability (recall \"in the interests of full disclosure, here are the ten critical points ...\"), experience (\"that, after years of working on usage problems, I've settled on\"), exhaustive and tech-savvy research (\"For contemporary usage, the files of our greatest dictionary makers pale in comparison with the fulltext search capabilities now provided by NEXIS and WESTLAW\"), an even and judicious temperament (see e.g. this from HYPERCORRECTION: \"Sometimes people strive to abide by the strictest etiquette, but in the process behave inappropriately\" [52] ), and the sort of humble integrity (for instance, including in one of the entries a past published usage-error of his own) that not only renders Garner likable but transmits the same kind of reverence for English that good jurists have for the law, both of which are bigger and more important than any one person.\n\nProbably the most attractive thing about ADMAU's Ethical Appeal, though, is Garner's scrupulous consideration of the reader's concern about his (or her) own linguistic authority and rhetorical persona and ability to convince an Audience that he cares. Again and again, Garner frames his prescriptions in rhetorical terms, e.g.: \"To the writer or speaker for whom credibility is important, it's a good idea to avoid distracting any readers or listeners.\" Dictionary of Modern American Usage's real thesis, in other words, is that the purposes of the expert authority and the purposes of the lay reader are identical, and identically rhetorical \u2014 which I submit is about as Democratic these days as you're going to get.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. With the advent of online databases, Garner has access to far more examples of actual usage than did Gilman, and he deploys them to great effect. (FYI, Oxford's 1996 New Fowler's Modern English Usage is also extremely comprehensive and good, but its emphasis is on British usage.)\n\n2. Sorry about this phrase: I hate this phrase, too. This happens to be one of those very rare times when \"historical context\" is the phrase to use and there is no equivalent phrase that isn't even worse. (I actually tried \"lexico-temporal backdrop\" in one of the middle drafts, which I think you'll agree is not preferable.)\n\nINTERPOLATION\n\nThe above [paragraph] is motivated by the fact that this reviewer almost always sneers and/or winces when he sees \"historical context\" deployed in a piece of writing and thus hopes to head off any potential sneers/winces from the reader here, especially in an article about felicitous usage.\n\n3. SNOOT (n) (highly colloq) is this reviewer's nuclear family's nickname a clef for a really extreme usage fanatic, the sort of person whose idea of Sunday fun is to look for mistakes in Safire's column's prose itself. This reviewer's family is roughly 70 percent SNOOT, which term itself derives from an acronym, with the big historical family joke being that whether S.N.O.O.T. stood for \"Sprachgefuhl Necessitates Our Ongoing Tendance\" or \"Syntax Nudniks of Our Time\" depended on whether or not you were one.\n\n4. This is true in my own case at any rate \u2014 plus also the \"uncomfortable\" part. I teach college English part-time \u2014 mostly Lit, not Comp. But I am also so pathologically anal about(*) usage that every semester the same thing happens: The minute I have read my students' first set of papers, we immediately abandon the regular Lit syllabus and have a three-week Emergency Remedial Usage Unit, during which my demeanor is basically that of somebody teaching HIV prevention to intravenous-drug users. When it emerges (as it does, every time) that 95 percent of these intelligent upscale college students have never been taught, e.g., what a clause is or why a misplaced \"only\" can make a sentence confusing, I all but pound my head on the blackboard; I exhort them to sue their hometown school boards. The kids end up scared, both of me and for me.\n\n(*) Editor's Note: Author insisted this phrase replace \"obsessed with\" and took umbrage at the suggestion that this change clearly demonstrated the very quality he wished to denigrate.\n\n5. Please note that the strategically repeated 1-P pronoun is meant to iterate and emphasize that this reviewer is very much one too, a SNOOT, plus to connote the nuclear family mentioned supra. SNOOTitude runs in families. In ADMAU's Preface, Bryan Garner mentions both his father and grandfather and actually uses the word genetic, and it's probably true: 95 percent of the SNOOTs I know have at least one parent who is, by profession or temperament or both, a SNOOT. In my own case, my mom is a Comp teacher and has written remedial usage books and is a SNOOT of the most rabid and intractable sort. At least part of the reason I am a SNOOT is that for years Mom brainwashed us in all sorts of subtle ways. Here's an example. Family suppers often involved a game: If one of us children made a usage error. Mom would pretend to have a coughing fit that would go on and on until the relevant child had identified the relevant error and corrected it. It was all very self-ironic and lighthearted; but still, looking back, it seems a bit excessive to pretend that your child is actually denying you oxygen by speaking incorrectly. But the really chilling thing is that I now sometimes find myself playing this same \"game\" with my own students, complete with pretend pertussion.\n\nINTERPOLATION\n\nAs something I'm all but sure Harper's will excise, I'll also insert that we even had a lighthearted but retrospectively chilling little family song that Mom and we little SNOOTlets would sing in the car on long trips while Dad silently rolled his eyes and drove (you have to remember the title theme of Underdog in order to follow the song):\n\nWhen idiots in this world appear\nAnd fail to be concise or clear\nAnd solecisms rend the ear\nThe cry goes up both far and near\n\nFor Blunder Dog\n\nBlunder Dog\n\nBlunder Dog\n\nBlunder Dog\n\n[etc.](*)\n\n(*) (Since this'll almost surely get cut, I'll admit that, yes, I, as a kid, was the actual author of this song. But by this time I'd been thoroughly brainwashed. And just about the whole car sang along. It was sort of our family's version of \"100 Bottles ... Wall.\")\n\n6. If Samuel Johnson is the Shakespeare of English usage, think of Henry Watson Fowler as the Eliot or Joyce. His 1926 A Dictionary of Modern English Usage is the granddaddy of modern usage guides, and its dust-dry wit and blushless imperiousness have been models for every subsequent classic in the field, from Eric Partridge's Usage and Abusage to Theodore Bernstein's The Careful Writer to Wilson Follett's Modern American Usage to Gilman's '89 Webster's.\n\n7. (Garner prescribes spelling out only numbers under ten. I was taught that this rule applies just to Business Writing and that in all other modes you spell out one through nineteen and start using cardinals at 20.(*) De gustibus non est disputandum.)\n\n(*) Editor's Note: The Harper's style manual prescribes spelling out all numbers up to 100.\n\n8. From personal experience, I can assure you that any kid like this is going to be at best marginalized and at worst savagely and repeatedly Wedgied.\nBack\n\n9. What follow in the Preface are \"... the ten critical points that, after years of working on usage problems, I've settled on.\" These points are too involved to treat separately, but a couple of them are slippery in the extreme \u2014 e.g., \"10. Actual Usage. In the end, the actual usage of educated speakers and writers is the over arching criterion for correctness,\" of which both \"educated\" and \"actual\" would require several pages of abstract clarification and qualification to shore up against Usage Wars-related attacks, but which Garner rather ingeniously elects to define and defend via their application in his dictionary itself.\n\n10. There's no better indication of The Dictionary's authority than that we use it to settle wagers. My own father is still to this day living down the outcome of a high-stakes bet on the correct spelling of meringue, a wager made on 14 September 1978.\n\n11. Editor's Note: The Harper's style manual prescribes okay.\n\n12. This is a clever half-truth. Linguists compose only one part of the anti-judgment camp, and their objections to usage judgments involve way more than just \"subjectivity.\"\n\n13. In this last respect, recall for example W. J. Clinton's famous \"I feel your pain,\" which was a blatant if not particularly masterful Ethical Appeal.\n\n14. Really, howled, blistering reviews and outraged editorials from across the country \u2014 from the Times and The New Yorker and good old Life, or q.v. this from the January '62 Atlantic: \"We have seen a novel dictionary formula improvised, in great part, out of snap judgments and the sort of theoretical improvement that in practice impairs; and we have seen the gates propped wide open in enthusiastic hospitality to miscellaneous confusions and corruptions. In fine, the anxiously awaited work that was to have crowned cisatlantic linguistic scholarship with a particular glory turns out to be a scandal and a disaster.\"\n\n15. Note for example the mordant pith (and royal we) of this random snippet from Partridge's Usage and Abusage:\n\nanxious of. `I am not hopeless of our future. But I am\nprofoundly anxious of it', Beverley Nichols, News of England,\n1938: which made us profoundly anxious For (or about)\n\u2014 not of \u2014 Mr Nichols's literary future.\n\nOr see the near-Himalayan condescension of Fowler, here on some other people's use of words to mean things the words don't really mean:\n\nslipshod extension ... is especially likely to occur\nwhen some accident gives currency among the\nuneducated to words of learned origin, & the more\nif they are isolated or have few relatives in the\nvernacular.... The original meaning of feasible is\nsimply doable (L facere do); but to the unlearned\nit is a mere token, of which he has to infer the value\nfrom the contexts in which he hears it used, because\nsuch relatives as it has in English \u2014 Feat, feature,\nfaction, &c. \u2014 either fail to show the obvious\nfamily likeness to which he is accustomed among\nfamilies of indigenous words, or are (like malfeasance)\noutside his range.\n\n16. Utter bushwa: As ADMAU's body makes clear, Garner knows exactly when the Descriptivists started influencing language guides.\n\n17. (which in fact is true)\n\n18. (Q.v. \"The Pharmakon\" in Derrida's La dissemination \u2014 but you'd probably be better off just trusting me.)\n\n19. Standard Written English (SWE) is also sometimes called Standard English (SE) or Educated English, but the inditement-emphasis is the same.\n\nSEMI-INTERPOLATION\n\nPlus note that Garner's Preface explicitly names ADMAU's intended audience as \"writers and editors.\" And even ads for the dictionary in such organs as The New York Review of Books are built around the slogan \"If you like to WRITE ... Rear to us.\"(*)\n\n(*) (Yr. SNOOT rev. cannot help observing, w/r/t these ads, that the opening r in Refer here should not be capitalized after a dependent clause + ellipses \u2014 Quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus.)\n\n20. True, some sort of 100 percent compendious real-time Mega-dictionary might be possible online, though it'd take a small army of lexical webmasters and a much larger army of in situ actual-use reporters and surveillance techs; plus it'd be GNP-level expensive.\n\n21. New Criticism refers to T. S. Eliot and I. A. Richards and F. R. Leavis and Cleanth Brooks and Wimsatt & Beardsley and the whole \"close reading\" school that dominated literary criticism from WWI well into the seventies.\n\n22. (\"EVIDENCE OF CANCER LINK REFUTED BY TOBACCO INSTITUTE RESEARCHERS\")\n\n23. This proposition is in fact true, as is interpolatively demonstrated below, and although the demonstration is extremely persuasive it is also, as you can see from the size of this FN, lengthy and involved and rather, umm, dense, so that again you'd probably be better off simply granting the truth of the proposition and forging on with the main text.\n\nINTERPOLATIVE DEMONSTRATION OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A PRIVATE LANGUAGE\nIt's sometimes tempting to imagine that there can be such a things as Private Language. Many of us are prone to lay-philosophising about the weird privacy of our own mental states, for example, and from the fact that when my knee hurts only I can feel it, it's tempting to conclude that for me the word pain has a very subjective internal meaning that only I can truly understand. This line of thinking is sort of like the adolescent pot-smoker's terror that his own inner experience is both private and unverifiable, a syndrome that is techinically known as Cannabalic Solipsism. Eating ChipsAhoy! and staring very intently at the television's network PGA event, for instance, the adolescent potsmoker is struck by ghastly possibility that, e.g., what he sees as the color green and what other people call \"the color green\" may in fact not be the same color experiences at all The fact that both he and someone else call Pebble Beach's fairways green and a stoplight's GO signal green appears to guarantee only that there is a similar consistency in their color experience of fairways and GO lights, not that the actual subjective quality of those color experiences is the same; it could be that what the ad. pot-smoker experiences as green everyone else actually experiences as blue, and what we \"mean\" by the Word blue is what he \"means\" by green, etc., etc., until the Whole line of thinking gets so vexed and exhausting that the a.p.-s, ends up slumped crumb-strewn and paralyzed in his chair.\n\nThe point here is that the idea of a Private Language, like Private Colors and most of the other solipsistic conceits with which this particular reviewer has at various times been afflicted, is both deluded and demonstrably false.\n\nIn the case of Private Language, the delusion is usually based on the belief that a word such as pain has the meaning it does because it is somehow \"connected\" to a feeling in my knee. But as Mr. L. Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations proved in the 1950s, words actually have the meanings they do because of certain rules and verification tests that are imposed on us from outside our own subjectivities, viz., by the community in which we have to get along and communicate with other people. Wittgenstein's argument, which is admittedly very complex and gnomic and opaque, basically centers on the fact that a word like \"pain\" means what it does for me because of the way the community I'm part of has tacitly agreed to use \"pain\".\n\nIf you're thinking that all this fuss is not only abstract but also pretty irrelevant to the Usage Wars or to anything you have any real interest in at all, you are very much mistaken. If words' meanings depend on transpersonal rules and these rules on community consensus, language is not only conceptually non-Private but also irreducibly public, political, and ideological. This means that questions about our national consensus on grammar and usage arc actually bound up with every last social issue that millennial America's about \u2014 class, race, gender, morality, tolerance, pluralism, cohesion, equality, fairness, money: You name it.\n\n24. Norms, after all, are just practices people have agreed on as optimal ways of doing things for certain purposes. They're not laws, but they're not laissez-faire, either.\n\n25. In his The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language (1994), Steven Pinker puts it this way: \"No one, not even a valley girl, has to be told not to say 'Apples the eat boy' or 'The child seems sleeping' or 'Who did you meet John and?' or the vast, vast majority of the millions of trillions of mathematically possible combinations of words.\n\n26. In the Case of Steve Pinker Jr., those people are the boy's peers and teachers and crossing guards etc. In the case of adult cross-dressers and drag queens who have jobs in the Straight World and wear pants to those jobs, it's coworkers and clients and people on the subway. For the die-hard slob who nevertheless wears a coat and a tie to work, it's mostly his boss, who himself doesn't want his employee's clothes to send clients \"the wrong message.\" But of course it's all basically the same thing.\n\n27. In fact, the only time one ever hears the issue made explicit is in radio ads for tapes that promise to improve people's vocabulary. These ads are extremely ominous and intimidating and always start out with \"DID YOU KNOW PEOPLE JUDGE YOU BY THE WORDS YOU USE?\n\n28. (... not to mention color, gender, creed \u2014 you can see how fraught and charged all this is going to get)\n\n29. Discourse Community is an example of that rare kind of academic jargon that's actually a valuable addition to SWE because it captures something at once very complex and very specific that no other English term quite can.(*)\n\n(*) (The above is an obvious attempt to preempt readerly sneers/winces at the term's continued deployment in this article.)\n\n30. (Plus it's true that whether something gets called a \"subdialect\" or \"jargon\" seems to depend on how much it annoys people outside its Discourse Community. Garner himself has miniessays on AIRLINESE, COMPUTERESE, LEGALESE, and BUREAUCRATESE, and he more or less calls all of them jargon. There is no ADMAU miniessay on DIALECTS, but there is one On JARGON, in which such is Garner's self-restraint that you can almost hear his tendons straining, as in \" [Jargon] arises from the urge to save time and space \u2014 and occasionally to conceal meaning from the uninitiated.\")\n\n31. (a redundancy that's a bit arbitrary, since \"Where's it from?\" isn't redundant [mainly because whence has vanished into semi-archaism])\n\n32. A synthetic language uses inflections to dictate syntax, whereas an analytic language uses word order. Latin, German, and Russian are synthetic; English and Chinese, analytic.\n\n33. (Q.v. for example Sir Thomas Smith's cortex-withering De Recta et Emendata Linguae Anglicae Scriptione Dialogus of 1568.)\n\n34. But note that he's sane about it. Some split infinitives really are clunky and hard to parse, especially when there are a whole bunch of words between to and the verb \u2014 \"We will attempt to swiftly and to the best of our ability respond to these charges\" \u2014 which Garner calls \"wide splits\" and sensibly discourages. His overall verdict on s.i.'s \u2014 which is that some are \"perfectly proper\" and some iffy and some just totally bad news, and that no one wide tidy dogmatic ukase[???] can handle all s.i. cases, and thus that \"knowing when to split an infinitive requires a good ear and a keen eye\" \u2014 is a good example of the way Garner distinguishes sound and helpful Descriptivist objections from wacko or dogmatic objections and then incorporates the sound objections into a smarter and more flexible Prescriptivism.\n\n35. The SNOOTlet is, as it happens, an indispensable part of other kids' playground education. The kids are learning that a Group's identity depends as much on exclusion as inclusion. They are, in other words, starting to learn about Us and Them, and about how an Us always needs a Them because being not-Them is essential to being Us. Because they're kids and it's school, the obvious Them is the teachers and all the values and appurtenances of the teacher world. This teacher-Them helps the kids see how to start to be an Us, but the SNOOTlet completes the puzzle by providing the as it were missing link: He is the Traitor, the Us who is in fact not Us but Them.\n\nIn sum, the SNOOTier is teaching his peers that the criteria for membership in Us are not just age, station, inability to stay up past 9:00, etc. \u2014 that in fact Us is primarily a state of mind and a set of sensibilities. An ideology.\n\n36. (The skirt-in-school scenario was not personal stuff, FYI.)\n\n37. There are still Some of these teachers around, at least here in the Midwest. YOU know the type: lipless, tweedy, cancrine \u2014 Old Maids of both genders. If you had one (as I did, 1976-77), you surely remember him.\n\n38. (Or require us openly to acknowledge and talk about elitism, whereas a dogmatic SNOOT's pedagogy is merely elitism in action.)\n\n39. (I'm not a total idiot.)\n\n40. E.g., this is the reasoning behind many Pop Prescriptivists' complaint that shoddy usage signifies the Decline of Western Civilization.\n\n41. A Dictionary of Modern American Usage includes a miniessay on VOGUE WORDS, but it's a disappointing one in that Garner does little more than list VW's that bug him and say that \"vogue words have such a grip on the popular mind that they come to be used in contexts in which they serve little purpose.\" This is one of the rare places in ADMAU where Garner is simply wrong. The real problem is that every sentence blends and balances at least two different communicative functions \u2014 one the transmission of raw info, the other the transmission of certain stuff about the speaker \u2014 and Vogue Usage throws this balance off. Garher's \"serve little purpose\" is exactly incorrect; vogue words serve too much the purpose of presenting the speaker in a certain light (even if this is merely as with-it or hip), and people's subliminal B.S.-antennae pick this imbalance up, and that's why even nonSNOOTs often find Vogue Usage irritating and creepy.\n\n42. FYI, this passage, which appears in ADMAU's entry on OBSCURITY, is quoted from a 1997 Sacramento Bee article entitled \"No Contest: English Professors Are Worst Writers on Campus.\"\n\n43. This was in his 1946 \"Politics and the English Language,\" an essay that despite its date (and its title's basic redundancy) remains the definitive SNOOT statement on Academese. Orwell's famous AE translation of the gorgeous \"I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift\" in Ecclesiastes as \"Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account\" should be tattooed on the left wrist of every grad student in the anglophone world.\n\n44. Please just don't even say it.\n\n45. (She professed to have been especially traumatized by the climactic \"I am going to make you,\" which in retrospect was indeed a mammoth rhetorical boner.)\n\n46. (The Dept. head and Dean did not, as it happens, share her reaction ... though it would be disingenuous not to tell you that they happened also to be PWM's, which fact did not go unremarked by the complainant, such that the whole proceeding got pretty darn tense, indeed, before it was all over.)\n\n47. To be honest, I noticed this omission only because midway through working on this article I happened to use the word trough in front of the same SNOOT friend who Likes to compare public English to violin-hammering, and he fell sideways out of his chair, and it emerged that I have somehow all my life misheard trough as ending with a th instead of an f and thus have publicly mispronounced it God knows how many scores of times, and I all but burned rubber getting home to see whether perhaps the error was so common and human and understandable that Garner himself had a good-natured entry on it, but no such luck which in fairness I don't suppose I can really blame Garner for.\n\n48. (on zwieback vs. zweiback)\n\n49. (meaning literally Democratictic \u2014 it Wants Your Vote)\n\n50. The last two words of this sentence, of course, are what the Usage Wars are about \u2014 whose \"language\" and whose \"well\"? The most remarkable thing about this sentence is that coming from Garner it doesn't sound naive or obnoxious but just ... reasonable.\n\n51. Did you think I was kidding?\n\n52.

Because they're kids and it's school, the obvious Them is the teachers and all the values and appurtenances of the teacher world. This teacher-Them helps the kids see how to start to be an Us, but the SNOOTlet completes the puzzle by providing the as it were missing link: He is the Traitor, the Us who is in fact not Us but Them.\n\nIn sum, the SNOOTier is teaching his peers that the criteria for membership in Us are not just age, station, inability to stay up past 9:00, etc. \u2014 that in fact Us is primarily a state of mind and a set of sensibilities. An ideology.\nBack\n\n36. (The skirt-in-school scenario was not personal stuff, FYI.)\nBack\n\n37. There are still Some of these teachers around, at least here in the Midwest. YOU know the type: lipless, tweedy, cancrine \u2014 Old Maids of both genders. If you had one (as I did, 1976-77), you surely remember him.\nBack\n\n38. (Or require us openly to acknowledge and talk about elitism, whereas a dogmatic SNOOT's pedagogy is merely elitism in action.)\nBack\n\n39. (I'm not a total idiot.)\nBack\n\n40. E.g., this is the reasoning behind many Pop Prescriptivists' complaint that shoddy usage signifies the Decline of Western Civilization.\nBack\n\n41. A Dictionary of Modern American Usage includes a miniessay on VOGUE WORDS, but it's a disappointing one in that Garner does little more than list VW's that bug him and say that \"vogue words have such a grip on the popular mind that they come to be used in contexts in which they serve little purpose.\" This is one of the rare places in ADMAU where Garner is simply wrong. The real problem is that every sentence blends and balances at least two different communicative functions \u2014 one the transmission of raw info, the other the transmission of certain stuff about the speaker \u2014 and Vogue Usage throws this balance off. Garher's \"serve little purpose\" is exactly incorrect; vogue words serve too much the purpose of presenting the speaker in a certain light (even if this is merely as with-it or hip), and people's subliminal B.S.-antennae pick this imbalance up, and that's why even nonSNOOTs often find Vogue Usage irritating and creepy.\nBack\n\n42. FYI, this passage, which appears in ADMAU's entry on OBSCURITY, is quoted from a 1997 Sacramento Bee article entitled \"No Contest: English Professors Are Worst Writers on Campus.\"\nBack\n\n43. This was in his 1946 \"Politics and the English Language,\" an essay that despite its date (and its title's basic redundancy) remains the definitive SNOOT statement on Academese. Orwell's famous AE translation of the gorgeous \"I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift\" in Ecclesiastes as \"Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account\" should be tattooed on the left wrist of every grad student in the anglophone world.\nBack\n\n44. Please just don't even say it.\nBack\n\n45. (She professed to have been especially traumatized by the climactic \"I am going to make you,\" which in retrospect was indeed a mammoth rhetorical boner.)\nBack\n\n46. (The Dept. head and Dean did not, as it happens, share her reaction ... though it would be disingenuous not to tell you that they happened also to be PWM's, which fact did not go unremarked by the complainant, such that the whole proceeding got pretty darn tense, indeed, before it was all over.)\nBack\n\n47. To be honest, I noticed this omission only because midway through working on this article I happened to use the word trough in front of the same SNOOT friend who Likes to compare public English to violin-hammering, and he fell sideways out of his chair, and it emerged that I have somehow all my life misheard trough as ending with a th instead of an f and thus have publicly mispronounced it God knows how many scores of times, and I all but burned rubber getting home to see whether perhaps the error was so common and human and understandable that Garner himself had a good-natured entry on it, but no such luck which in fairness I don't suppose I can really blame Garner for.\nBack\n\n48. (on zwieback vs. zweiback)\nBack\n\n49. (meaning literally Democratictic \u2014 it Wants Your Vote)\nBack\n\n50. The last two words of this sentence, of course, are what the Usage Wars are about \u2014 whose \"language\" and whose \"well\"? The most remarkable thing about this sentence is that coming from Garner it doesn't sound naive or obnoxious but just ... reasonable.\nBack\n\n51. Did you think I was kidding?\nBack\n\n52. (Here this reviewer's indwelling and ever-vigilant SNOOT can't help but question why Garner uses a comma before the conjunction in this sentence, since what follows the conjunction is neither an independent clause nor any kind of plausible complement for strive to. But respectful disagreement between people of goodwill is of course Democratically natural and healthy and, when you come right down to it, kind of fun.)\nBack\n\nDavid Foster Wallace is a contributing editor to Harper's Magazine and the author of the novel Infinite Jest and other works.

Sometimes, when I had put out my candle, my eyes would close so quickly that I had not even time to say \"I'm going to sleep.\" And half an hour later the thought that it was time to go to sleep would awaken me; I would try to put away the book which, I imagined, was still in my hands, and to blow out the light; I had been thinking all the time, while I was asleep, of what I had just been reading, but my thoughts had run into a channel of their own, until I myself seemed actually to have become the subject of my book: a church, a quartet, the rivalry between Fran\u00e7ois I and Charles V. This impression would persist for some moments after I was awake; it did not disturb my mind, but it lay like scales upon my eyes and prevented them from registering the fact that the candle was no longer burning. Then it would begin to seem unintelligible, as the thoughts of a former existence must be to a reincarnate spirit; the subject of my book would separate itself from me, leaving me free to choose whether I would form part of it or no; and at the same time my sight would return and I would be astonished to find myself in a state of darkness, pleasant and restful enough for the eyes, and even more, perhaps, for my mind, to which it appeared incomprehensible, without a cause, a matter dark indeed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would ask myself what o'clock it could be; I could hear the whistling of trains, which, now nearer and now farther off, punctuating the distance like the note of a bird in a forest, shewed me in perspective the deserted countryside through which a traveller would be hurrying towards the nearest station: the path that he followed being fixed for ever in his memory by the general excitement due to being in a strange place, to doing unusual things, to the last words of conversation, to farewells exchanged beneath an unfamiliar lamp which echoed still in his ears amid the silence of the night; and to the delightful prospect of being once again at home.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would lay my cheeks gently against the comfortable cheeks of my pillow, as plump and blooming as the cheeks of babyhood. Or I would strike a match to look at my watch. Nearly midnight. The hour when an invalid, who has been obliged to start on a journey and to sleep in a strange hotel, awakens in a moment of illness and sees with glad relief a streak of daylight shewing under his bedroom door. Oh, joy of joys! it is morning. The servants will be about in a minute: he can ring, and some one will come to look after him. The thought of being made comfortable gives him strength to endure his pain. He is certain he heard footsteps: they come nearer, and then die away. The ray of light beneath his door is extinguished. It is midnight; some one has turned out the gas; the last servant has gone to bed, and he must lie all night in agony with no one to bring him any help.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would fall asleep, and often I would be awake again for short snatches only, just long enough to hear the regular creaking of the wainscot, or to open my eyes to settle the shifting kaleidoscope of the darkness, to savour, in an instantaneous flash of perception, the sleep which lay heavy upon the furniture, the room, the whole surroundings of which I formed but an insignificant part and whose unconsciousness I should very soon return to share. Or, perhaps, while I was asleep I had returned without the least effort to an earlier stage in my life, now for ever outgrown; and had come under the thrall of one of my childish terrors, such as that old terror of my great-uncle's pulling my curls, which was effectually dispelled on the day--the dawn of a new era to me--on which they were finally cropped from my head. I had forgotten that event during my sleep; I remembered it again immediately I had succeeded in making myself wake up to escape my great-uncle's fingers; still, as a measure of precaution, I would bury the whole of my head in the pillow before returning to the world of dreams.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, too, just as Eve was created from a rib of Adam, so a woman would come into existence while I was sleeping, conceived from some strain in the position of my limbs. Formed by the appetite that I was on the point of gratifying, she it was, I imagined, who offered me that gratification. My body, conscious that its own warmth was permeating hers, would strive to become one with her, and I would awake. The rest of humanity seemed very remote in comparison with this woman whose company I had left but a moment ago: my cheek was still warm with her kiss, my body bent beneath the weight of hers. If, as would sometimes happen, she had the appearance of some woman whom I had known in waking hours, I would abandon myself altogether to the sole quest of her, like people who set out on a journey to see with their own eyes some city that they have always longed to visit, and imagine that they can taste in reality what has charmed their fancy. And then, gradually, the memory of her would dissolve and vanish, until I had forgotten the maiden of my dream.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a man is asleep, he has in a circle round him the chain of the hours, the sequence of the years, the order of the heavenly host. Instinctively, when he awakes, he looks to these, and in an instant reads off his own position on the earth's surface and the amount of time that has elapsed during his slumbers; but this ordered procession is apt to grow confused, and to break its ranks. Suppose that, towards morning, after a night of insomnia, sleep descends upon him while he is reading, in quite a different position from that in which he normally goes to sleep, he has only to lift his arm to arrest the sun and turn it back in its course, and, at the moment of waking, he will have no idea of the time, but will conclude that he has just gone to bed. Or suppose that he gets drowsy in some even more abnormal position; sitting in an armchair, say, after dinner: then the world will fall topsy-turvy from its orbit, the magic chair will carry him at full speed through time and space, and when he opens his eyes again he will imagine that he went to sleep months earlier and in some far distant country. But for me it was enough if, in my own bed, my sleep was so heavy as completely to relax my consciousness; for then I lost all sense of the place in which I had gone to sleep, and when I awoke at midnight, not knowing where I was, I could not be sure at first who I was; I had only the most rudimentary sense of existence, such as may lurk and flicker in the depths of an animal's consciousness; I was more destitute of human qualities than the cave-dweller; but then the memory, not yet of the place in which I was, but of various other places where I had lived, and might now very possibly be, would come like a rope let down from heaven to draw me up out of the abyss of not-being, from which I could never have escaped by myself: in a flash I would traverse and surmount centuries of civilisation, and out of a half-visualised succession of oil-lamps, followed by shirts with turned-down collars, would put together by degrees the component parts of my ego.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the immobility of the things that surround us is forced upon them by our conviction that they are themselves, and not anything else, and by the immobility of our conceptions of them. For it always happened that when I awoke like this, and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful attempt to discover where I was, everything would be moving round me through the darkness: things, places, years. My body, still too heavy with sleep to move, would make an effort to construe the form which its tiredness took as an orientation of its various members, so as to induce from that where the wall lay and the furniture stood, to piece together and to give a name to the house in which it must be living. Its memory, the composite memory of its ribs, knees, and shoulder-blades offered it a whole series of rooms in which it had at one time or another slept; while the unseen walls kept changing, adapting themselves to the shape of each successive room that it remembered, whirling madly through the darkness. And even before my brain, lingering in consideration of when things had happened and of what they had looked like, had collected sufficient impressions to enable it to identify the room, it, my body, would recall from each room in succession what the bed was like, where the doors were, how daylight came in at the windows, whether there was a passage outside, what I had had in my mind when I went to sleep, and had found there when I awoke. The stiffened side underneath my body would, for instance, in trying to fix its position, imagine itself to be lying, face to the wall, in a big bed with a canopy; and at once I would say to myself, \"Why, I must have gone to sleep after all, and Mamma never came to say good night!\" for I was in the country with my grandfather, who died years ago; and my body, the side upon which I was lying, loyally preserving from the past an impression which my mind should never have forgotten, brought back before my eyes the glimmering flame of the night-light in its bowl of Bohemian glass, shaped like an urn and hung by chains from the ceiling, and the chimney-piece of Siena marble in my bedroom at Combray, in my great-aunt's house, in those far distant days which, at the moment of waking, seemed present without being clearly denned, but would become plainer in a little while when I was properly awake.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then would come up the memory of a fresh position; the wall slid away in another direction; I was in my room in Mme. de Saint-Loup's house in the country; good heavens, it must be ten o'clock, they will have finished dinner! I must have overslept myself, in the little nap which I always take when I come in from my walk with Mme. de Saint-Loup, before dressing for the evening. For many years have now elapsed since the Combray days, when, coming in from the longest and latest walks, I would still be in time to see the reflection of the sunset glowing in the panes of my bedroom window. It is a very different kind of existence at Tansonville now with Mme. de Saint-Loup, and a different kind of pleasure that I now derive from taking walks only in the evenings, from visiting by moonlight the roads on which I used to play, as a child, in the sunshine; while the bedroom, in which I shall presently fall asleep instead of dressing for dinner, from afar off I can see it, as we return from our walk, with its lamp shining through the window, a solitary beacon in the night.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These shifting and confused gusts of memory never lasted for more than a few seconds; it often happened that, in my spell of uncertainty as to where I was, I did not distinguish the successive theories of which that uncertainty was composed, we isolate the successive positions of its body as they appear upon a bioscope. But I had seen first one and then another of the rooms in which I had slept during my life, and in the end I would revisit them all in the long course of my waking dream: rooms in winter, where on going to bed I would at once bury my head in a nest, built up out of the most diverse materials, the corner of my pillow, the top of my blankets, a piece of a shawl, the edge of my bed, and a copy of an evening paper, all of which things I would contrive, with the infinite patience of birds building their nests, to cement into one whole; rooms where, in a keen frost, I would feel the satisfaction of being shut in from the outer world (like the sea-swallow which builds at the end of a dark tunnel and is kept warm by the surrounding earth), and where, the fire keeping in all night, I would sleep wrapped up, as it were, in a great cloak of snug and savoury air, shot with the glow of the logs which would break out again in flame: in a sort of alcove without walls, a cave of warmth dug out of the heart of the room itself, a zone of heat whose boundaries were constantly shifting and altering in temperature as gusts of air ran across them to strike freshly upon my face, from the corners of the room, or from parts near the window or far from the fireplace which had therefore remained cold--or rooms in summer, where I would delight to feel myself a part of the warm evening, where the moonlight striking upon the half-opened shutters would throw down to the foot of my bed its enchanted ladder; where I would fall asleep, as it might be in the open air, like a titmouse which the breeze keeps poised in the focus of a sunbeam--or sometimes the Louis XVI room, so cheerful that I could never feel really unhappy, even on my first night in it: that room where the slender columns which lightly supported its ceiling would part, ever so gracefully, to indicate where the bed was and to keep it separate; sometimes again that little room with the high ceiling, hollowed in the form of a pyramid out of two separate storeys, and partly walled with mahogany, in which from the first moment my mind was drugged by the unfamiliar scent of flowering grasses, convinced of the hostility of the violet curtains and of the insolent indifference of a clock that chattered on at the top of its voice as though I were not there; while a strange and pitiless mirror with square feet, which stood across one corner of the room, cleared for itself a site I had not looked to find tenanted in the quiet surroundings of my normal field of vision: that room in which my mind, forcing itself for hours on end to leave its moorings, to elongate itself upwards so as to take on the exact shape of the room, and to reach to the summit of that monstrous funnel, had passed so many anxious nights while my body lay stretched out in bed, my eyes staring upwards, my ears straining, my nostrils sniffing uneasily, and my heart beating; until custom had changed the colour of the curtains, made the clock keep quiet, brought an expression of pity to the cruel, slanting face of the glass, disguised or even completely dispelled the scent of flowering grasses, and distinctly reduced the apparent loftiness of the ceiling. Custom! that skilful but unhurrying manager who begins by torturing the mind for weeks on end with her provisional arrangements; whom the mind, for all that, is fortunate in discovering, for without the help of custom it would never contrive, by its own efforts, to make any room seem habitable.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly I was now well awake; my body had turned about for the last time and the good angel of certainty had made all the surrounding objects stand still, had set me down under my bedclothes, in my bedroom, and had fixed, approximately in their right places in the uncertain light, my chest of drawers, my writing-table, my fireplace, the window overlooking the street, and both the doors. But it was no good my knowing that I was not in any of those houses of which, in the stupid moment of waking, if I had not caught sight exactly, I could still believe in their possible presence; for memory was now set in motion; as a rule I did not attempt to go to sleep again at once, but used to spend the greater part of the night recalling our life in the old days at Combray with my great-aunt, at Balbec, Paris, Donci\u00e8res, Venice, and the rest; remembering again all the places and people that I had known, what I had actually seen of them, and what others had told me.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Combray, as every afternoon ended, long before the time when I should have to go up to bed, and to lie there, unsleeping, far from my mother and grandmother, my bedroom became the fixed point on which my melancholy and anxious thoughts were centred. Some one had had the happy idea of giving me, to distract me on evenings when I seemed abnormally wretched, a magic lantern, which used to be set on top of my lamp while we waited for dinner-time to come: in the manner of the master-builders and glass-painters of gothic days it substituted for the opaqueness of my walls an impalpable iridescence, supernatural phenomena of many colours, in which legends were depicted, as on a shifting and transitory window. But my sorrows were only increased, because this change of lighting destroyed, as nothing else could have done, the customary impression I had formed of my room, thanks to which the room itself, but for the torture of having to go to bed in it, had become quite endurable. For now I no longer recognised it, and I became uneasy, as though I were in a room in some hotel or furnished lodging, in a place where I had just arrived, by train, for the first time.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Riding at a jerky trot, Golo, his mind filled with an infamous design, issued from the little three-cornered forest which dyed dark-green the slope of a convenient hill, and advanced by leaps and bounds towards the castle of poor Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant. This castle was cut off short by a curved line which was in fact the circumference of one of the transparent ovals in the slides which were pushed into position through a slot in the lantern. It was only the wing of a castle, and in front of it stretched a moor on which Genevi\u00e8ve stood, lost in contemplation, wearing a blue girdle. The castle and the moor were yellow, but I could tell their colour without waiting to see them, for before the slides made their appearance the old-gold sonorous name of Brabant had given me an unmistakable clue. Golo stopped for a moment and listened sadly to the little speech read aloud by my great-aunt, which he seemed perfectly to understand, for he modified his attitude with a docility not devoid of a degree of majesty, so as to conform to the indications given in the text; then he rode away at the same jerky trot. And nothing could arrest his slow progress. If the lantern were moved I could still distinguish Golo's horse advancing across the window-curtains, swelling out with their curves and diving into their folds. The body of Golo himself, being of the same supernatural substance as his steed's, overcame all material obstacles--everything that seemed to bar his way--by taking each as it might be a skeleton and embodying it in himself: the door-handle, for instance, over which, adapting itself at once, would float invincibly his red cloak or his pale face, never losing its nobility or its melancholy, never shewing any sign of trouble at such a transubstantiation.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, indeed, I found plenty of charm in these bright projections, which seemed to have come straight out of a Merovingian past, and to shed around me the reflections of such ancient history. But I cannot express the discomfort I felt at such an intrusion of mystery and beauty into a room which I had succeeded in filling with my own personality until I thought no more of the room than of myself. The anaesthetic effect of custom being destroyed, I would begin to think and to feel very melancholy things. The door-handle of my room, which was different to me from all the other doorhandles in the world, inasmuch as it seemed to open of its own accord and without my having to turn it, so unconscious had its manipulation become; lo and behold, it was now an astral body for Golo. And as soon as the dinner-bell rang I would run down to the dining-room, where the big hanging lamp, ignorant of Golo and Bluebeard but well acquainted with my family and the dish of stewed beef, shed the same light as on every other evening; and I would fall into the arms of my mother, whom the misfortunes of Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant had made all the dearer to me, just as the crimes of Golo had driven me to a more than ordinarily scrupulous examination of my own conscience.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But after dinner, alas, I was soon obliged to leave Mamma, who stayed talking with the others, in the garden if it was fine, or in the little parlour where everyone took shelter when it was wet. Everyone except my grandmother, who held that \"It is a pity to shut oneself indoors in the country,\" and used to carry on endless discussions with my father on the very wettest days, because he would send me up to my room with a book instead of letting me stay out of doors. \"That is not the way to make him strong and active,\" she would say sadly, \"especially this little man, who needs all the strength and character that he can get.\" My father would shrug his shoulders and study the barometer, for he took an interest in meteorology, while my mother, keeping very quiet so as not to disturb him, looked at him with tender respect, but not too hard, not wishing to penetrate the mysteries of his superior mind. But my grandmother, in all weathers, even when the rain was coming down in torrents and Fran\u00e7oise had rushed indoors with the precious wicker armchairs, so that they should not get soaked--you would see my grandmother pacing the deserted garden, lashed by the storm, pushing back her grey hair in disorder so that her brows might be more free to imbibe the life-giving draughts of wind and rain. She would say, \"At last one can breathe!\" and would run up and down the soaking paths--too straight and symmetrical for her liking, owing to the want of any feeling for nature in the new gardener, whom my father had been asking all morning if the weather were going to improve--with her keen, jerky little step regulated by the various effects wrought upon her soul by the intoxication of the storm, the force of hygiene, the stupidity of my education and of symmetry in gardens, rather than by any anxiety (for that was quite unknown to her) to save her plum-coloured skirt from the spots of mud under which it would gradually disappear to a depth which always provided her maid with a fresh problem and filled her with fresh despair.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When these walks of my grandmother's took place after dinner there was one thing which never failed to bring her back to the house: that was if (at one of those points when the revolutions of her course brought her, moth-like, in sight of the lamp in the little parlour where the liqueurs were set out on the card-table) my great-aunt called out to her: \"Bathilde! Come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy!\" For, simply to tease her (she had brought so foreign a type of mind into my father's family that everyone made a joke of it), my great-aunt used to make my grandfather, who was forbidden liqueurs, take just a few drops. My poor grandmother would come in and beg and implore her husband not to taste the brandy; and he would become annoyed and swallow his few drops all the same, and she would go out again sad and discouraged, but still smiling, for she was so humble and so sweet that her gentleness towards others, and her continual subordination of herself and of her own troubles, appeared on her face blended in a smile which, unlike those seen on the majority of human faces, had no trace in it of irony, save for herself, while for all of us kisses seemed to spring from her eyes, which could not look upon those she loved without yearning to bestow upon them passionate caresses. The torments inflicted on her by my great-aunt, the sight of my grandmother's vain entreaties, of her in her weakness conquered before she began, but still making the futile endeavour to wean my grandfather from his liqueur-glass--all these were things of the sort to which, in later years, one can grow so well accustomed as to smile at them, to take the tormentor's side with a happy determination which deludes one into the belief that it is not, really, tormenting; but in those days they filled me with such horror that I longed to strike my great-aunt. And yet, as soon as I heard her \"Bathilde! Come in and stop your husband from drinking brandy!\" in my cowardice I became at once a man, and did what all we grown men do when face to face with suffering and injustice; I preferred not to see them; I ran up to the top of the house to cry by myself in a little room beside the schoolroom and beneath the roof, which smelt of orris-root, and was scented also by a wild currant-bush which had climbed up between the stones of the outer wall and thrust a flowering branch in through the half-opened window. Intended for a more special and a baser use, this room, from which, in the daytime, I could see as far as the keep of Roussainville-le-Pin, was for a long time my place of refuge, doubtless because it was the only room whose door \u00cf was allowed to lock, whenever my occupation was such as required an inviolable solitude; reading or dreaming, secret tears or paroxysms of desire. Alas! I little knew that my own lack of will-power, my delicate health, and the consequent uncertainty as to my future weighed far more heavily on my grandmother's mind than any little breach of the rules by her husband, during those endless perambulations, afternoon and evening, in which we used to see passing up and down, obliquely raised towards the heavens, her handsome face with its brown and wrinkled cheeks, which with age had acquired almost the purple hue of tilled fields in autumn, covered, if she were walking abroad, by a half-lifted veil, while upon them either the cold or some sad reflection invariably left the drying traces of an involuntary tear.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My sole consolation when I went upstairs for the night was that Mamma would come in and kiss me after I was in bed. But this good night lasted for so short a time: she went down again so soon that the moment in which I heard her climb the stairs, and then caught the sound of her garden dress of blue muslin, from which hung little tassels of plaited straw, rustling along the double-doored corridor, was for me a moment of the keenest sorrow. So much did I love that good night that I reached the stage of hoping that it would come as late as possible, so as to prolong the time of respite during which Mamma would not yet have appeared. Sometimes when, after kissing me, she opened the door to go, I longed to call her back, to say to her \"Kiss me just once again,\" but I knew that then she would at once look displeased, for the concession which she made to my wretchedness and agitation in coming up to me with this kiss of peace always annoyed my father, who thought such ceremonies absurd, and she would have liked to try to induce me to outgrow the need, the custom of having her there at all, which was a very different thing from letting the custom grow up of my asking her for an additional kiss when she was already crossing the threshold. And to see her look displeased destroyed all the sense of tranquillity she had brought me a moment before, when she bent her loving face down over my bed, and held it out to me like a Host, for an act of Communion in which my lips might drink deeply the sense of her real presence, and with it the power to sleep. But those evenings on which Mamma stayed so short a time in my room were sweet indeed compared to those on which we had guests to dinner, and therefore she did not come at all. Our 'guests' were practically limited to M. Swann, who, apart from a few passing strangers, was almost the only person who ever came to the house at Combray, sometimes to a neighbourly dinner (but less frequently since his unfortunate marriage, as my family did not care to receive his wife) and sometimes after dinner, uninvited. On those evenings when, as we sat in front of the house beneath the big chestnut-tree and round the iron table, we heard, from the far end of the garden, not the large and noisy rattle which heralded and deafened as he approached with its ferruginous, interminable, frozen sound any member of the household who had put it out of action by coming in 'without ringing,' but the double peal--timid, oval, gilded--of the visitors' bell, everyone would at once exclaim \"A visitor! Who in the world can it be?\" but they knew quite well that it could only be M. Swann. My great-aunt, speaking in a loud voice, to set an example, in a tone which she endeavoured to make sound natural, would tell the others not to whisper so; that nothing could be more unpleasant for a stranger coming in, who would be led to think that people were saying things about him which he was not meant to hear; and then my grandmother would be sent out as a scout, always happy to find an excuse for an additional turn in the garden, which she would utilise to remove surreptitiously, as she passed, the stakes of a rose-tree or two, so as to make the roses look a little more natural, as a mother might run her hand through her boy's hair, after the barber had smoothed it down, to make it stick out properly round his head.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And there we would all stay, hanging on the words which would fall from my grandmother's lips when she brought us back her report of the enemy, as though there had been some uncertainty among a vast number of possible invaders, and then, soon after, my grandfather would say: \"I can hear Swann's voice.\" And, indeed, one could tell him only by his voice, for it was difficult to make out his face with its arched nose and green eyes, under a high forehead fringed with fair, almost red hair, dressed in the Bressant style, because in the garden we used as little light as possible, so as not to attract mosquitoes: and I would slip away as though not going for anything in particular, to tell them to bring out the syrups; for my grandmother made a great point, thinking it 'nicer' of their not being allowed to seem anything out of the ordinary, which we kept for visitors only. Although a far younger man, M. Swann was very much attached to my grandfather, who had been an intimate friend, in his time, of Swann's father, an excellent but an eccentric man in whom the least little thing would, it seemed, often check the flow of his spirits and divert the current of his thoughts. Several times in the course of a year I would hear my grandfather tell at table the story, which never varied, of the behaviour of M. Swann the elder upon the death of his wife, by whose bedside he had watched day and night. My grandfather, who had not seen him for a long time, hastened to join him at the Swanns' family property on the outskirts of Combray, and managed to entice him for a moment, weeping profusely, out of the death-chamber, so that he should not be present when the body was laid in its coffin. They took a turn or two in the park, where there was a little sunshine. Suddenly M. Swann seized my grandfather by the arm and cried, \"Oh, my dear old friend, how fortunate we are to be walking here together on such a charming day! Don't you see how pretty they are, all these trees--my hawthorns, and my new pond, on which you have never congratulated me? You look as glum as a night-cap. Don't you feel this little breeze? Ah! whatever you may say, it's good to be alive all the same, my dear Am\u00e9d\u00e9e!\" And then, abruptly, the memory of his dead wife returned to him, and probably thinking it too complicated to inquire into how, at such a time, he could have allowed himself to be carried away by an impulse of happiness, he confined himself to a gesture which he habitually employed whenever any perplexing question came into his mind: that is, he passed his hand across his forehead, dried his eyes, and wiped his glasses. And he could never be consoled for the loss of his wife, but used to say to my grandfather, during the two years for which he survived her, \"It's a funny thing, now; I very often think of my poor wife, but I cannot think of her very much at any one time.\" \"Often, but a little at a time, like poor old Swann,\" became one of my grandfather's favourite phrases, which he would apply to all kinds of things. And I should have assumed that this father of Swann's had been a monster if my grandfather, whom I regarded as a better judge than myself, and whose word was my law and often led me in the long run to pardon offences which I should have been inclined to condemn, had not gone on to exclaim, \"But, after all, he had a heart of gold.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For many years, albeit--and especially before his marriage--M. Swann the younger came often to see them at Combray, my great-aunt and grandparents never suspected that he had entirely ceased to live in the kind of society which his family had frequented, or that, under the sort of incognito which the name of Swann gave him among us, they were harbouring--with the complete innocence of a family of honest innkeepers who have in their midst some distinguished highwayman and never know it--one of the smartest members of the Jockey Club, a particular friend of the Comte de Paris and of the Prince of Wales, and one of the men most sought after in the aristocratic world of the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our utter ignorance of the brilliant part which Swann was playing in the world of fashion was, of course, due in part to his own reserve and discretion, but also to the fact that middle-class people in those days took what was almost a Hindu view of society, which they held to consist of sharply defined castes, so that everyone at his birth found himself called to that station in life which his parents already occupied, and nothing, except the chance of a brilliant career or of a 'good' marriage, could extract you from that station or admit you to a superior caste. M. Swann, the father, had been a stockbroker; and so 'young Swann' found himself immured for life in a caste where one's fortune, as in a list of taxpayers, varied between such and such limits of income. We knew the people with whom his father had associated, and so we knew his own associates, the people with whom he was 'in a position to mix.' If he knew other people besides, those were youthful acquaintances on whom the old friends of the family, like my relatives, shut their eyes all the more good-naturedly that Swann himself, after he was left an orphan, still came most faithfully to see us; but we would have been ready to wager that the people outside our acquaintance whom Swann knew were of the sort to whom he would not have dared to raise his hat, had he met them while he was walking with ourselves. Had there been such a thing as a determination to apply to Swann a social coefficient peculiar to himself, as distinct from all the other sons of other stockbrokers in his father's position, his coefficient would have been rather lower than theirs, because, leading a very simple life, and having always had a craze for 'antiques' and pictures, he now lived and piled up his collections in an old house which my grandmother longed to visit, but which stood on the Quai d'Orl\u00e9ans, a neighbourhood in which my great-aunt thought it most degrading to be quartered. \"Are you really a connoisseur, now?\" she would say to him; \"I ask for your own sake, as you are likely to have 'fakes' palmed off on you by the dealers,\" for she did not, in fact, endow him with any critical faculty, and had no great opinion of the intelligence of a man who, in conversation, would avoid serious topics and shewed a very dull preciseness, not only when he gave us kitchen recipes, going into the most minute details, but even when my grandmother's sisters were talking to him about art. When challenged by them to give an opinion, or to express his admiration for some picture, he would remain almost impolitely silent, and would then make amends by furnishing (if he could) some fact or other about the gallery in which the picture was hung, or the date at which it had been painted. But as a rule he would content himself with trying to amuse us by telling us the story of his latest adventure--and he would have a fresh story for us on every occasion--with some one whom we ourselves knew, such as the Combray chemist, or our cook, or our coachman. These stories certainly used to make my great-aunt laugh, but she could never tell whether that was on account of the absurd parts which Swann invariably made himself play in the adventures, or of the wit that he shewed in telling us of them. \"It is easy to see that you are a regular 'character,' M. Swann!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As she was the only member of our family who could be described as a trifle 'common,' she would always take care to remark to strangers, when Swann was mentioned, that he could easily, if he had wished to, have lived in the Boulevard Haussmann or the Avenue de l'Op\u00e9ra, and that he was the son of old M. Swann who must have left four or five million francs, but that it was a fad of his. A fad which, moreover, she thought was bound to amuse other people so much that in Paris, when M. Swann called on New Year's Day bringing her a little packet of marrons glac\u00e9s, she never failed, if there were strangers in the room, to say to him: \"Well, M. Swann, and do you still live next door to the Bonded Vaults, so as to be sure of not missing your train when you go to Lyons?\" and she would peep out of the corner of her eye, over her glasses, at the other visitors.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if anyone had suggested to my aunt that this Swann, who, in his capacity as the son of old M. Swann, was 'fully qualified' to be received by any of the 'upper middle class,' the most respected barristers and solicitors of Paris (though he was perhaps a trifle inclined to let this hereditary privilege go into abeyance), had another almost secret existence of a wholly different kind: that when he left our house in Paris, saying that he must go home to bed, he would no sooner have turned the corner than he would stop, retrace his steps, and be off to some drawing-room on whose like no stockbroker or associate of stockbrokers had ever set eyes--that would have seemed to my aunt as extraordinary as, to a woman of wider reading, the thought of being herself on terms of intimacy with Aristaeus, of knowing that he would, when he had finished his conversation with her, plunge deep into the realms of Thetis, into an empire veiled from mortal eyes, in which Virgil depicts him as being received with open arms; or--to be content with an image more likely to have occurred to her, for she had seen it painted on the plates we used for biscuits at Combray--as the thought of having had to dinner Ali Baba, who, as soon as he found himself alone and unobserved, would make his way into the cave, resplendent with its unsuspected treasures.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day when he had come to see us after dinner in Paris, and had begged pardon for being in evening clothes, Fran\u00e7oise, when he had gone, told us that she had got it from his coachman that he had been dining \"with a princess.\" \"A pretty sort of princess,\" drawled my aunt; \"I know them,\" and she shrugged her shoulders without raising her eyes from her knitting, serenely ironical.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Altogether, my aunt used to treat him with scant ceremony. Since she was of the opinion that he ought to feel flattered by our invitations, she thought it only right and proper that he should never come to see us in summer without a basket of peaches or raspberries from his garden, and that from each of his visits to Italy he should bring back some photographs of old masters for me.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It seemed quite natural, therefore, to send to him whenever we wanted a recipe for some special sauce or for a pineapple salad for one of our big dinner-parties, to which he himself would not be invited, not seeming of sufficient importance to be served up to new friends who might be in our house for the first time. If the conversation turned upon the Princes of the House of France, \"Gentlemen, you and I will never know, will we, and don't want to, do we?\" my great-aunt would say tartly to Swann, who had, perhaps, a letter from Twickenham in his pocket; she would make him play accompaniments and turn over music on evenings when my grandmother's sister sang; manipulating this creature, so rare and refined at other times and in other places, with the rough simplicity of a child who will play with some curio from the cabinet no more carefully than if it were a penny toy. Certainly the Swann who was a familiar figure in all the clubs of those days differed hugely from, the Swann created in my great-aunt's mind when, of an evening, in our little garden at Combray, after the two shy peals had sounded from the gate, she would vitalise, by injecting into it everything she had ever heard about the Swann family, the vague and unrecognisable shape which began to appear, with my grandmother in its wake, against a background of shadows, and could at last be identified by the sound of its voice. But then, even in the most insignificant details of our daily life, none of us can be said to constitute a material whole, which is identical for everyone, and need only be turned up like a page in an account-book or the record of a will; our social personality is created by the thoughts of other people. Even the simple act which we describe as \"seeing some one we know\" is, to some extent, an intellectual process. We pack the physical outline of the creature we see with all the ideas we have already formed about him, and in the complete picture of him which we compose in our minds those ideas have certainly the principal place. In the end they come to fill out so completely the curve of his cheeks, to follow so exactly the line of his nose, they blend so harmoniously in the sound of his voice that these seem to be no more than a transparent envelope, so that each time we see the face or hear the voice it is our own ideas of him which we recognise and to which we listen. And so, no doubt, from the Swann they had built up for their own purposes my family had left out, in their ignorance, a whole crowd of the details of his daily life in the world of fashion, details by means of which other people, when they met him, saw all the Graces enthroned in his face and stopping at the line of his arched nose as at a natural frontier; but they contrived also to put into a face from which its distinction had been evicted, a face vacant and roomy as an untenanted house, to plant in the depths of its unvalued eyes a lingering sense, uncertain but not unpleasing, half-memory and half-oblivion, of idle hours spent together after our weekly dinners, round the card-table or in the garden, during our companionable country life. Our friend's bodily frame had been so well lined with this sense, and with various earlier memories of his family, that their own special Swann had become to my people a complete and living creature; so that even now I have the feeling of leaving some one I know for another quite different person when, going back in memory, I pass from the Swann whom I knew later and more intimately to this early Swann\u2014this early Swann in whom I can distinguish the charming mistakes of my childhood, and who, incidentally, is less like his successor than he is like the other people I knew at that time, as though one's life were a series of galleries in which all the portraits of any one period had a marked family likeness, the same (so to speak) tonality--this early Swann abounding in leisure, fragrant with the scent of the great chestnut-tree, of baskets of raspberries and of a sprig of tarragon.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet one day, when my grandmother had gone to ask some favour of a lady whom she had known at the Sacr\u00e9 Coeur (and with whom, because of our caste theory, she had not cared to keep up any degree of intimacy in spite of several common interests), the Marquise de Villeparisis, of the famous house of Bouillon, this lady had said to her:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think you know M. Swann very well; he is a great friend of my nephews, the des Laumes.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother had returned from the call full of praise for the house, which overlooked some gardens, and in which Mme. de Villeparisis had advised her to rent a flat; and also for a repairing tailor and his daughter, who kept a little shop in the courtyard, into which she had gone to ask them to put a stitch in her skirt, which she had torn on the staircase. My grandmother had found these people perfectly charming: the girl, she said, was a jewel, and the tailor a most distinguished man, the finest she had ever seen. For in her eyes distinction was a thing wholly independent of social position. She was in ecstasies over some answer the tailor had made, saying to Mamma:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"S\u00e9vign\u00e9 would not have said it better!\" and, by way of contrast, of a nephew of Mme. de Villeparisis whom she had met at the house:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My dear, he is so common!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, the effect of that remark about Swann had been, not to raise him in my great-aunt's estimation, but to lower Mme. de Villeparisis. It appeared that the deference which, on my grandmother's authority, we owed to Mme. de Villeparisis imposed on her the reciprocal obligation to do nothing that would render her less worthy of our regard, and that she had failed in her duty in becoming aware of Swann's existence and in allowing members of her family to associate with him. \"How should she know Swann? A lady who, you always made out, was related to Marshal Mac-Mahon!\" This view of Swann's social atmosphere which prevailed in my family seemed to be confirmed later on by his marriage with a woman of the worst class, you might almost say a 'fast' woman, whom, to do him justice, he never attempted to introduce to us, for he continued to come to us alone, though he came more and more seldom; but from whom they thought they could establish, on the assumption that he had found her there, the circle, unknown to them, in which he ordinarily moved.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But on one occasion my grandfather read in a newspaper that M. Swann was one of the most faithful attendants at the Sunday luncheons given by the Duc de X----, whose father and uncle had been among our most prominent statesmen in the reign of Louis Philippe. Now my grandfather was curious to learn all the little details which might help him to take a mental share in the private lives of men like Mole, the Duc Pasquier, or the Duc de Broglie. He was delighted to find that Swann associated with people who had known them. My great-aunt, however, interpreted this piece of news in a sense discreditable to Swann; for anyone who chose his associates outside the caste in which he had been born and bred, outside his 'proper station,' was condemned to utter degradation in her eyes. It seemed to her that such a one abdicated all claim to enjoy the fruits of those friendly relations with people of good position which prudent parents cultivate and store up for their children's benefit, for my great-aunt had actually ceased to 'see' the son of a lawyer we had known because he had married a 'Highness' and had thereby stepped down--in her eyes--from the respectable position of a lawyer's son to that of those adventurers, upstart footmen or stable-boys mostly, to whom we read that queens have sometimes shewn their favours. She objected, therefore, to my grandfather's plan of questioning Swann, when next he came to dine with us, about these people whose friendship with him we had discovered. On the other hand, my grandmother's two sisters, elderly spinsters who shared her nobility of character but lacked her intelligence, declared that they could not conceive what pleasure their brother-in-law could find in talking about such trifles. They were ladies of lofty ambition, who for that reason were incapable of taking the least interest in what might be called the 'pinchbeck' things of life, even when they had an historic value, or, generally speaking, in anything that was not directly associated with some object aesthetically precious. So complete was their negation of interest in anything which seemed directly or indirectly a part of our everyday life that their sense of hearing--which had gradually come to understand its own futility when the tone of the conversation, at the dinner-table, became frivolous or merely mundane, without the two old ladies' being able to guide it back to the topic dear to themselves--would leave its receptive channels unemployed, so effectively that they were actually becoming atrophied. So that if my grandfather wished to attract the attention of the two sisters, he would have to make use of some such alarm signals as mad-doctors adopt in dealing with their distracted patients; as by beating several times on a glass with the blade of a knife, fixing them at the same time with a sharp word and a compelling glance, violent methods which the said doctors are apt to bring with them into their everyday life among the sane, either from force of professional habit or because they think the whole world a trifle mad.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Their interest grew, however, when, the day before Swann was to dine with us, and when he had made them a special present of a case of Asti, my great-aunt, who had in her hand a copy of the Figaro in which to the name of a picture then on view in a Corot exhibition were added the words, \"from the collection of M. Charles Swann,\" asked: \"Did you see that Swann is 'mentioned' in the Figaro?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I have always told you,\" said my grandmother, \"that he had plenty of taste.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You would, of course,\" retorted my great-aunt, \"say anything just to seem different from us.\" For, knowing that my grandmother never agreed with her, and not being quite confident that it was her own opinion which the rest of us invariably endorsed, she wished to extort from us a wholesale condemnation of my grandmother's views, against which she hoped to force us into solidarity with her own.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But we sat silent. My grandmother's sisters having expressed a desire to mention to Swann this reference to him in the Figaro, my great-aunt dissuaded them. Whenever she saw in others an advantage, however trivial, which she herself lacked, she would persuade herself that it was no advantage at all, but a drawback, and would pity so as not to have to envy them.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't think that would please him at all; I know very well, I should hate to see my name printed like that, as large as life, in the paper, and I shouldn't feel at all flattered if anyone spoke to me about it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She did not, however, put any very great pressure upon my grandmother's sisters, for they, in their horror of vulgarity, had brought to such a fine art the concealment of a personal allusion in a wealth of ingenious circumlocution, that it would often pass unnoticed even by the person to whom it was addressed. As for my mother, her only thought was of managing to induce my father to consent to speak to Swann, not of his wife, but of his daughter, whom he worshipped, and for whose sake it was understood that he had ultimately made his unfortunate marriage.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You need only say a word; just ask him how she is. It must be so very hard for him.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father, however, was annoyed: \"No, no; you have the most absurd ideas. It would be utterly ridiculous.\"\n\nBut the only one of us in whom the prospect of Swann's arrival gave rise to an unhappy foreboding was myself. And that was because on the evenings when there were visitors, or just M. Swann in the house, Mamma did not come up to my room. I did not, at that time, have dinner with the family: I came out to the garden after dinner, and at nine I said good night and went to bed. But on these evenings I used to dine earlier than the others, and to come in afterwards and sit at table until eight o'clock, when it was understood that I must go upstairs; that frail and precious kiss which Mamma used always to leave upon my lips when I was in bed and just going to sleep I had to take with me from the dining-room to my own, and to keep inviolate all the time that it took me to undress, without letting its sweet charm be broken, without letting its volatile essence diffuse itself and evaporate; and just on those very evenings when I must needs take most pains to receive it with due formality, I had to snatch it, to seize it instantly and in public, without even having the time or being properly free to apply to what I was doing the punctiliousness which madmen use who compel themselves to exclude all other thoughts from their minds while they are shutting a door, so that when the sickness of uncertainty sweeps over them again they can triumphantly face and overcome it with the recollection of the precise moment in which the door was shut.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were all in the garden when the double peal of the gate-bell sounded shyly. Everyone knew that it must be Swann, and yet they looked at one another inquiringly and sent my grandmother scouting.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"See that you thank him intelligibly for the wine,\" my grandfather warned his two sisters-in-law; \"you know how good it is, and it is a huge case.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, don't start whispering!\" said my great-aunt. \"How would you like to come into a house and find everyone muttering to themselves?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah! There's M. Swann,\" cried my father. \"Let's ask him if he thinks it will be fine to-morrow.\"\n\nMy mother fancied that a word from her would wipe out all the unpleasantness which my family had contrived to make Swann feel since his marriage. She found an opportunity to draw him aside for a moment. But I followed her: I could not bring myself to let her go out of reach of me while I felt that in a few minutes I should have to leave her in the dining-room and go up to my bed without the consoling thought, as on ordinary evenings, that she would come up, later, to kiss me.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, M. Swann,\" she said, \"do tell me about your daughter; I am sure she shews a taste already for nice things, like her papa.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Come along and sit down here with us all on the verandah,\" said my grandfather, coming up to him. My mother had to abandon the quest, but managed to extract from the restriction itself a further refinement of thought, as great poets do when the tyranny of rhyme forces them into the discovery of their finest lines.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We can talk about her again when we are by ourselves,\" she said, or rather whispered to Swann. \"It is only a mother who can understand. I am sure that hers would agree with me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so we all sat down round the iron table. I should have liked not to think of the hours of anguish which I should have to spend, that evening, alone in my room, without the possibility of going to sleep: I tried to convince myself that they were of no importance, really, since I should have forgotten them next morning, and to fix my mind on thoughts of the future which would carry me, as on a bridge, across the terrifying abyss that yawned at my feet. But my mind, strained by this foreboding, distended like the look which I shot at my mother, would not allow any other impression to enter. Thoughts did, indeed, enter it, but only on the condition that they left behind them every element of beauty, or even of quaintness, by which I might have been distracted or beguiled. As a surgical patient, by means of a local anaesthetic, can look on with a clear consciousness while an operation is being performed upon him and yet feel nothing, I could repeat to myself some favourite lines, or watch my grandfather attempting to talk to Swann about the Duc d'Audriffet-Pasquier, without being able to kindle any emotion from one or amusement from the other. Hardly had my grandfather begun to question Swann about that orator when one of my grandmother's sisters, in whose ears the question echoed like a solemn but untimely silence which her natural politeness bade her interrupt, addressed the other with:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just fancy, Flora, I met a young Swedish governess to-day who told me some most interesting things about the co-operative movement in Scandinavia. We really must have her to dine here one evening.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To be sure!\" said her sister Flora, \"but I haven't wasted my time either. I met such a clever old gentleman at M. Vinteuil's who knows Maubant quite well, and Maubant has told him every little thing about how he gets up his parts. It is the most interesting thing I ever heard. He is a neighbour of M. Vinteuil's, and I never knew; and he is so nice besides.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"M. Vinteuil is not the only one who has nice neighbours,\" cried my aunt C\u00e9line in a voice which seemed loud because she was so timid, and seemed forced because she had been planning the little speech for so long; darting, as she spoke, what she called a 'significant glance' at Swann. And my aunt Flora, who realised that this veiled utterance was C\u00e9line's way of thanking Swann intelligibly for the Asti, looked at him with a blend of congratulation and irony, either just, because she wished to underline her sister's little epigram, or because she envied Swann his having inspired it, or merely because she imagined that he was embarrassed, and could not help having a little fun at his expense.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think it would be worth while,\" Flora went on, \"to have this old gentleman to dinner. When you get him upon Maubant or Mme. Materna he will talk for hours on end.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That must be delightful,\" sighed my grandfather, in whose mind nature had unfortunately forgotten to include any capacity whatsoever for becoming passionately interested in the co-operative movement among the ladies of Sweden or in the methods employed by Maubant to get up his parts, just as it had forgotten to endow my grandmother's two sisters with a grain of that precious salt which one has oneself to 'add to taste' in order to extract any savour from a narrative of the private life of Mole or of the Comte de Paris.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I say!\" exclaimed Swann to my grandfather, \"what I was going to tell you has more to do than you might think with what you were asking me just now, for in some respects there has been very little change. I came across a passage in Saint-Simon this morning which would have amused you. It is in the volume which covers his mission to Spain; not one of the best, little more in fact than a journal, but at least it is a journal wonderfully well written, which fairly distinguishes it from the devastating journalism that we feel bound to read in these days, morning, noon and night.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I do not agree with you: there are some days when I find reading the papers very pleasant indeed!\" my aunt Flora broke in, to show Swann that she had read the note about his Corot in the Figaro.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes,\" aunt C\u00e9line went one better. \"When they write about things or people in whom we are interested.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't deny it,\" answered Swann in some bewilderment. \"The fault I find with our journalism is that it forces us to take an interest in some fresh triviality or other every day, whereas only three or four books in a lifetime give us anything that is of real importance. Suppose that, every morning, when we tore the wrapper off our paper with fevered hands, a transmutation were to take place, and we were to find inside it--oh! I don't know; shall we say Pascal's Pens\u00e9es?\" He articulated the title with an ironic emphasis so as not to appear pedantic. \"And then, in the gilt and tooled volumes which we open once in ten years,\" he went on, shewing that contempt for the things of this world which some men of the world like to affect, \"we should read that the Queen of the Hellenes had arrived at Cannes, or that the Princesse de L\u00e9on had given a fancy dress ball. In that way we should arrive at the right proportion between 'information' and 'publicity.'\" But at once regretting that he had allowed himself to speak, even in jest, of serious matters, he added ironically: \"We are having a most entertaining conversation; I cannot think why we climb to these lofty summits,\" and then, turning to my grandfather: \"Well, Saint-Simon tells how Maulevrier had had the audacity to offer his hand to his sons. You remember how he says of Maulevrier, 'Never did I find in that coarse bottle anything but ill-humour, boorishness, and folly.'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Coarse or not, I know bottles in which there is something very different!\" said Flora briskly, feeling bound to thank Swann as well as her sister, since the present of Asti had been addressed to them both. C\u00e9line began to laugh.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann was puzzled, but went on: \"'I cannot say whether it was his ignorance or a trap,' writes Saint-Simon; 'he wished to give his hand to my children. I noticed it in time to prevent him.'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandfather was already in ecstasies over \"ignorance or a trap,\" but Miss C\u00e9line--the name of Saint-Simon, a 'man of letters,' having arrested the complete paralysis of her sense of hearing--had grown angry.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What! You admire that, do you? Well, it is clever enough! But what is the point of it? Does he mean that one man isn't as good as another? What difference can it make whether he is a duke or a groom so long as he is intelligent and good? He had a fine way of bringing up his children, your  Saint-Simon, if he didn't teach them to shake hands with all honest men. Really and truly, it's abominable. And you dare to quote it!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And my grandfather, utterly depressed, realising how futile it would be for him, against this opposition, to attempt to get Swann to tell him the stories which would have amused him, murmured to my mother: \"Just tell me again that line of yours which always comforts me so much on these occasions. Oh, yes:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What virtues, Lord, Thou makest us abhor!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good, that is, very good.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I never took my eyes off my mother. I knew that when they were at table I should not be permitted to stay there for the whole of dinner-time, and that Mamma, for fear of annoying my father, would not allow me to give her in public the series of kisses that she would have had in my room. And so I promised myself that in the dining-room, as they began to eat and drink and as I felt the hour approach, I would put beforehand into this kiss, which was bound to be so brief and stealthy in execution, everything that my own efforts could put into it: would look out very carefully first the exact spot on her cheek where I would imprint it, and would so prepare my thoughts that I might be able, thanks to these mental preliminaries, to consecrate the whole of the minute Mamma would allow me to the sensation of her cheek against my lips, as a painter who can have his subject for short sittings only prepares his palette, and from what he remembers and from rough notes does in advance everything which he possibly can do in the sitter's absence. But to-night, before the dinner-bell had sounded, my grandfather said with unconscious cruelty: \"The little man looks tired; he'd better go up to bed. Besides, we are dining late to-night.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And my father, who was less scrupulous than my grandmother or mother in observing the letter of a treaty, went on: \"Yes, run along; to bed with you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would have kissed Mamma then and there, but at that moment the dinner-bell rang.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, no, leave your mother alone. You've said good night quite enough. These exhibitions are absurd. Go on upstairs.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so I must set forth without viaticum; must climb each step of the staircase 'against my heart,' as the saying is, climbing in opposition to my heart's desire, which was to return to my mother, since she had not, by her kiss, given my heart leave to accompany me forth. That hateful staircase, up which I always passed with such dismay, gave out a smell of varnish which had to some extent absorbed, made definite and fixed the special quality of sorrow that I felt each evening, and made it perhaps even more cruel to my sensibility because, when it assumed this olfactory guise, my intellect was powerless to resist it. When we have gone to sleep with a maddening toothache and are conscious of it only as a little girl whom we attempt, time after time, to pull out of the water, or as a line of Moli\u00e8re which we repeat incessantly to ourselves, it is a great relief to wake up, so that our intelligence can disentangle the idea of toothache from any artificial semblance of heroism or rhythmic cadence. It was the precise converse of this relief which I felt when my anguish at having to go up to my room invaded my consciousness in a manner infinitely more rapid, instantaneous almost, a manner at once insidious and brutal as I breathed in--a far more poisonous thing than any moral penetration\u2014the peculiar smell of the varnish upon that staircase.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once in my room I had to stop every loophole, to close the shutters, to dig my own grave as I turned down the bed-clothes, to wrap myself in the shroud of my nightshirt. But before burying myself in the iron bed which had been placed there because, on summer nights, I was too hot among the rep curtains of the four-poster, I was stirred to revolt, and attempted the desperate stratagem of a condemned prisoner. I wrote to my mother begging her to come upstairs for an important reason which I could not put in writing. My fear was that Fran\u00e7oise, my aunt's cook who used to be put in charge of me when I was at Combray, might refuse to take my note. I had a suspicion that, in her eyes, to carry a message to my mother when there was a stranger in the room would appear flatly inconceivable, just as it would be for the door-keeper of a theatre to hand a letter to an actor upon the stage. For things which might or might not be done she possessed a code at once imperious, abundant, subtle, and uncompromising on points themselves imperceptible or irrelevant, which gave it a resemblance to those ancient laws which combine such cruel ordinances as the massacre of infants at the breast with prohibitions, of exaggerated refinement, against \"seething the kid in his mother's milk,\" or \"eating of the sinew which is upon the hollow of the thigh.\" This code, if one could judge it by the sudden obstinacy which she would put into her refusal to carry out certain of our instructions, seemed to have foreseen such social complications and refinements of fashion as nothing in Fran\u00e7oise's surroundings or in her career as a servant in a village household could have put into her head; and we were obliged to assume that there was latent in her some past existence in the ancient history of France, noble and little understood, just as there is in those manufacturing towns where old mansions still testify to their former courtly days, and chemical workers toil among delicately sculptured scenes of the Miracle of Theophilus or the Quatre Fils Aymon.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this particular instance, the article of her code which made it highly improbable that--barring an outbreak of fire--Fran\u00e7oise would go down and disturb Mamma when M. Swann was there for so unimportant a person as myself was one embodying the respect she shewed not only for the family (as for the dead, for the clergy, or for royalty), but also for the stranger within our gates; a respect which I should perhaps have found touching in a book, but which never failed to irritate me on her lips, because of the solemn and gentle tones in which she would utter it, and which irritated me more than usual this evening when the sacred character in which she invested the dinner-party might have the effect of making her decline to disturb its ceremonial. But to give myself one chance of success I lied without hesitation, telling her that it was not in the least myself who had wanted to write to Mamma, but Mamma who, on saying good night to me, had begged me not to forget to send her an answer about something she had asked me to find, and that she would certainly be very angry if this note were not taken to her. I think that Fran\u00e7oise disbelieved me, for, like those primitive men whose senses were so much keener than our own, she could immediately detect, by signs imperceptible by the rest of us, the truth or falsehood of anything that we might wish to conceal from her. She studied the envelope for five minutes as though an examination of the paper itself and the look of my handwriting could enlighten her as to the nature of the contents, or tell her to which article of her code she ought to refer the matter. Then she went out with an air of resignation which seemed to imply: \"What a dreadful thing for parents to have a child like this!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A moment later she returned to say that they were still at the ice stage and that it was impossible for the butler to deliver the note at once, in front of everybody; but that when the finger-bowls were put round he would find a way of slipping it into Mamma's hand. At once my anxiety subsided; it was now no longer (as it had been a moment ago) until to-morrow that I had lost my mother, for my little line was going--to annoy her, no doubt, and doubly so because this contrivance would make me ridiculous in Swann's eyes--but was going all the same to admit me, invisibly and by stealth, into the same room as herself, was going to whisper from me into her ear; for that forbidden and unfriendly dining-room, where but a moment ago the ice itself--with burned nuts in it--and the finger-bowls seemed to me to be concealing pleasures that were mischievous and of a mortal sadness because Mamma was tasting of them and I was far away, had opened its doors to me and, like a ripe fruit which bursts through its skin, was going to pour out into my intoxicated heart the gushing sweetness of Mamma's attention while she was reading what I had written. Now I was no longer separated from her; the barriers were down; an exquisite thread was binding us. Besides, that was not all, for surely Mamma would come.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the agony through which I had just passed, I imagined that Swann would have laughed heartily at it if he had read my letter and had guessed its purpose; whereas, on the contrary, as I was to learn in due course, a similar anguish had been the bane of his life for many years, and no one perhaps could have understood my feelings at that moment so well as himself; to him, that anguish which lies in knowing that the creature one adores is in some place of enjoyment where oneself is not and cannot follow--to him that anguish came through Love, to which it is in a sense predestined, by which it must be equipped and adapted; but when, as had befallen me, such an anguish possesses one's soul before Love has yet entered into one's life, then it must drift, awaiting Love's coming, vague and free, without precise attachment, at the disposal of one sentiment to-day, of another to-morrow, of filial piety or affection for a comrade. And the joy with which I first bound myself apprentice, when Fran\u00e7oise returned to tell me that my letter would be delivered; Swann, too, had known well that false joy which a friend can give us, or some relative of the woman we love, when on his arrival at the house or theatre where she is to be found, for some ball or party or 'first-night' at which he is to meet her, he sees us wandering outside, desperately awaiting some opportunity of communicating with her. He recognises us, greets us familiarly, and asks what we are doing there. And when we invent a story of having some urgent message to give to his relative or friend, he assures us that nothing could be more simple, takes us in at the door, and promises to send her down to us in five minutes. How much we love him\u2014as at that moment I loved Fran\u00e7oise--the good-natured intermediary who by a single word has made supportable, human, almost propitious the inconceivable, infernal scene of gaiety in the thick of which we had been imagining swarms of enemies, perverse and seductive, beguiling away from us, even making laugh at us, the woman whom we love. If we are to judge of them by him, this relative who has accosted us and who is himself an initiate in those cruel mysteries, then the other guests cannot be so very demoniacal. Those inaccessible and torturing hours into which she had gone to taste of unknown pleasures--behold, a breach in the wall, and we are\nthrough it. Behold, one of the moments whose series will go to make up their sum, a moment as genuine as the rest, if not actually more important to ourself because our mistress is more intensely a part of it; we picture it to ourselves, we possess it, we intervene upon it, almost we have created it: namely, the moment in which he goes to tell her that we are waiting there below. And very probably the other moments of the party will not be essentially different, will contain nothing else so exquisite or so well able to make us suffer, since this kind friend has assured us that \"Of course, she will be delighted to come down! It will be far more amusing for her to talk to you than to be bored up there.\" Alas! Swann had learned by experience that the good intentions of a third party are powerless to control a woman who is annoyed to find herself pursued even into a ball-room by a man whom she does not love. Too often, the kind friend comes down again alone.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother did not appear, but with no attempt to safeguard my self-respect (which depended upon her keeping up the fiction that she had asked me to let her know the result of my search for something or other) made Fran\u00e7oise tell me, in so many words \"There is no answer\"--words I have so often, since then, heard the hall-porters in 'mansions' and the flunkeys in gambling-clubs and the like, repeat to some poor girl, who replies in bewilderment: \"What! he's said nothing? It's not possible. You did give him my letter, didn't you? Very well, I shall wait a little longer.\" And just as she invariably protests that she does not need the extra gas which the porter offers to light for her, and sits on there, hearing nothing further, except an occasional remark on the weather which the porter exchanges with a messenger whom he will send off suddenly, when he notices the time, to put some customer's wine on the ice; so, having declined Fran\u00e7oise's offer to make me some tea or to stay beside me, I let her go off again to the servants' hall, and lay down and shut my eyes, and tried not to hear the voices of my family who were drinking their coffee in the garden.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But after a few seconds I realised that, by writing that line to Mamma, by approaching--at the risk of making her angry--so near to her that I felt I could reach out and grasp the moment in which I should see her again, I had cut myself off from the possibility of going to sleep until I actually had seen her, and my heart began to beat more and more painfully as I increased my agitation by ordering myself to keep calm and to acquiesce in my ill-fortune. Then, suddenly, my anxiety subsided, a feeling of intense happiness coursed through me, as when a strong medicine begins to take effect and one's pain vanishes: I had formed a resolution to abandon all attempts to go to sleep without seeing Mamma, and had decided to kiss her at all costs, even with the certainty of being in disgrace with her for long afterwards, when she herself came up to bed. The tranquillity which followed my anguish made me extremely alert, no less than my sense of expectation, my thirst for and my fear of danger.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Noiselessly I opened the window and sat down on the foot of my bed; hardly daring to move in case they should hear me from below. Things outside seemed also fixed in mute expectation, so as not to disturb the moonlight which, duplicating each of them and throwing it back by the extension, forwards, of a shadow denser and more concrete than its substance, had made the whole landscape seem at once thinner and longer, like a map which, after being folded up, is spread out upon the ground. What had to move--a leaf of the chestnut-tree, for instance--moved. But its minute shuddering, complete, finished to the least detail and with utmost delicacy of gesture, made no discord with the rest of the scene, and yet was not merged in it, remaining clearly outlined. Exposed upon this surface of silence, which absorbed nothing from them, the most distant sounds, those which must have come from gardens at the far end of the town, could be distinguished with such exact 'finish' that the impression they gave of coming from a distance seemed due only to their 'pianissimo' execution, like those movements on muted strings so well performed by the orchestra of the Conservatoire that, although one does not lose a single note, one thinks all the same that they are being played somewhere outside, a long way from the concert hall, so that all the old subscribers, and my grandmother's sisters too, when Swann had given them his seats, used to strain their ears as if they had caught the distant approach of an army on the march, which had not yet rounded the corner of the Rue de Tr\u00e9vise.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was well aware that I had placed myself in a position than which none could be counted upon to involve me in graver consequences at my parents' hands; consequences far graver, indeed, than a stranger would have imagined, and such as (he would have thought) could follow only some really shameful fault. But in the system of education which they had given me faults were not classified in the same order as in that of other children, and I had been taught to place at the head of the list (doubtless because there was no other class of faults from which I needed to be more carefully protected) those in which I can now distinguish the common feature that one succumbs to them by yielding to a nervous impulse.\nBut such words as these last had never been uttered in my hearing; no one had yet accounted for my temptations in a way which might have led me to believe that there was some excuse for my giving in to them, or that I was actually incapable of holding out against them. Yet I could easily recognise this class of transgressions by the anguish of mind which preceded, as well as by the rigour of the punishment which followed them; and I knew that what I had just done was in the same category as certain other sins for which I had been severely chastised, though infinitely more serious than they. When I went out to meet my mother as she herself came up to bed, and when she saw that I had remained up so as to say good night to her again in the passage, I should not be allowed to stay in the house a day longer, I should be packed off to school next morning; so much was certain. Very good: had I been obliged, the next moment, to hurl myself out of the window, I should still have preferred such a fate. For what I wanted now was Mamma, and to say good night to her. I had gone too far along the road which led to the realisation of this desire to be able to retrace my steps.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could hear my parents' footsteps as they went with Swann; and, when the rattle of the gate assured me that he had really gone, I crept to the window. Mamma was asking my father if he had thought the lobster good, and whether M. Swann had had some of the coffee-and-pistachio ice. \"I thought it rather so-so,\" she was saying; \"next time we shall have to try another flavour.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I can't tell you,\" said my great-aunt, \"what a change I find in Swann. He is quite antiquated!\" She had grown so accustomed to seeing Swann always in the same stage of adolescence that it was a shock to her to find him suddenly less young than the age she still attributed to him. And the others too were beginning to remark in Swann that abnormal, excessive, scandalous senescence, meet only in a celibate, in one of that class for whom it seems that the great day which knows no morrow must be longer than for other men, since for such a one it is void of promise, and from its dawn the moments steadily accumulate without any subsequent partition among his offspring.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I fancy he has a lot of trouble with that wretched wife of his, who 'lives' with a certain Monsieur de Charlus, as all Combray knows. It's the talk of the town.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother observed that, in spite of this, he had looked much less unhappy of late. \"And he doesn't nearly so often do that trick of his, so like his father, of wiping his eyes and passing his hand across his forehead. I think myself that in his heart of hearts he doesn't love his wife any more.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, of course he doesn't,\" answered my grandfather. \"He wrote me a letter about it, ages ago, to which I took care to pay no attention, but it left no doubt as to his feelings, let alone his love for his wife. Hullo! you two; you never thanked him for the Asti!\" he went on, turning to his sisters-in-law.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What! we never thanked him? I think, between you and me, that I put it to him quite neatly,\" replied my aunt Flora.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, you managed it very well; I admired you for it,\" said my aunt C\u00e9line.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But you did it very prettily, too.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes; I liked my expression about 'nice neighbours.'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What! Do you call that thanking him?\" shouted my grandfather. \"I heard that all right, but devil take me if I guessed it was meant for Swann. You may be quite sure he never noticed it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Come, come; Swann is not a fool. I am positive he appreciated the compliment. You didn't expect me to tell him the number of bottles, or to guess what he paid for them.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father and mother were left alone and sat down for a moment; then my father said: \"Well, shall we go up to bed?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"As you wish, dear, though I don't feel in the least like sleeping. I don't know why; it can't be the coffee-ice--it wasn't strong enough to keep me awake like this. But I see a light in the servants' hall: poor Fran\u00e7oise has been sitting up for me, so I will get her to unhook me while you go and undress.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother opened the latticed door which led from the hall to the staircase. Presently I heard her coming upstairs to close her window. I went quietly into the passage; my heart was beating so violently that I could hardly move, but at least it was throbbing no longer with anxiety, but with terror and with joy. I saw in the well of the stair a light coming upwards, from Mamma's candle. Then I saw Mamma herself: I threw myself upon her. For an instant she looked at me in astonishment, not realising what could have happened. Then her face assumed an expression of anger. She said not a single word to me; and, for that matter, I used to go for days on end without being spoken to, for far less offences than this. A single word from Mamma would have been an admission that further intercourse with me was within the bounds of possibility, and that might perhaps have appeared to me more terrible still, as indicating that, with such a punishment as was in store for me, mere silence, and even anger, were relatively puerile.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A word from her then would have implied the false calm in which one converses with a servant to whom one has just decided to give notice; the kiss one bestows on a son who is being packed off to enlist, which would have been denied him if it had merely been a matter of being angry with him for a few days. But she heard my father coming from the dressing-room, where he had gone to take off his clothes, and, to avoid the 'scene' which he would make if he saw me, she said, in a voice half-stifled by her anger: \"Run away at once. Don't let your father see you standing there like a crazy jane!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But I begged her again to \"Come and say good night to me!\" terrified as I saw the light from my father's candle already creeping up the wall, but also making use of his approach as a means of blackmail, in the hope that my mother, not wishing him to find me there, as find me he must if she continued to hold out, would give in to me, and say: \"Go back to your room. I will come.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Too late: my father was upon us. Instinctively I murmured, though no one heard me, \"I am done for!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was not, however. My father used constantly to refuse to let me do things which were quite clearly allowed by the more liberal charters granted me by my mother and grandmother, because he paid no heed to 'Principles,' and because in his sight there were no such things as 'Rights of Man.' For some quite irrelevant reason, or for no reason at all, he would at the last moment prevent me from taking some particular walk, one so regular and so consecrated to my use that to deprive me of it was a clear breach of faith; or again, as he had done this evening, long before the appointed hour he would snap out: \"Run along up to bed now; no excuses!\" But then again, simply because he was devoid of principles (in my grandmother's sense), so he could not, properly speaking, be called inexorable. He looked at me for a moment with an air of annoyance and surprise, and then when Mamma had told him, not without some embarrassment, what had happened, said to her: \"Go along with him, then; you said just now that you didn't feel like sleep, so stay in his room for a little. I don't need anything.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But dear,\" my mother answered timidly, \"whether or not I feel like sleep is not the point; we must not make the child accustomed...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There's no question of making him accustomed,\" said my father, with a shrug of the shoulders; \"you can see quite well that the child is unhappy. After all, we aren't gaolers. You'll end by making him ill, and a lot of good that will do. There are two beds in his room; tell Fran\u00e7oise to make up the big one for you, and stay beside him for the rest of the night. I'm off to bed, anyhow; I'm not nervous like you. Good night.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was impossible for me to thank my father; what he called my sentimentality would have exasperated him. I stood there, not daring to move; he was still confronting us, an immense figure in his white nightshirt, crowned with the pink and violet scarf of Indian cashmere in which, since he had begun to suffer from neuralgia, he used to tie up his head, standing like Abraham in the engraving after Benozzo Gozzoli which M. Swann had given me, telling Sarah that she must tear herself away from Isaac. Many years have passed since that night. The wall of the staircase, up which I had watched the light of his candle gradually climb, was long ago demolished. And in myself, too, many things have perished which, I imagined, would last for ever, and new structures have arisen, giving birth to new sorrows and new joys which in those days I could not have foreseen, just as now the old are difficult of comprehension. It is a long time, too, since my father has been able to tell Mamma to \"Go with the child.\" Never again will such hours be possible for me. But of late I have been increasingly able to catch, if I listen attentively, the sound of the sobs which I had the strength to control in my father's presence, and which broke out only when I found myself alone with Mamma. Actually, their echo has never ceased: it is only because life is now growing more and more quiet round about me that I hear them afresh, like those convent bells which are so effectively drowned during the day by the noises of the streets that one would suppose them to have been stopped for ever, until they sound out again through the silent evening air.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mamma spent that night in my room: when I had just committed a sin so deadly that I was waiting to be banished from the household, my parents gave me a far greater concession than I should ever have won as the reward of a good action. Even at the moment when it manifested itself in this crowning mercy, my father's conduct towards me was still somewhat arbitrary, and regardless of my deserts, as was characteristic of him and due to the fact that his actions were generally dictated by chance expediencies rather than based on any formal plan. And perhaps even what I called his strictness, when he sent me off to bed, deserved that title less, really, than my mother's or grandmother's attitude, for his nature, which in some respects differed more than theirs from my own, had probably prevented him from guessing, until then, how wretched I was every evening, a thing which my mother and grandmother knew well; but they loved me enough to be unwilling to spare me that suffering, which they hoped to teach me to overcome, so as to reduce my nervous sensibility and to strengthen my will. As for my father, whose affection for me was of another kind, I doubt if he would have shewn so much courage, for as soon as he had grasped the fact that I was unhappy he had said to my mother: \"Go and comfort him.\" Mamma stayed all night in my room, and it seemed that she did not wish to mar by recrimination those hours, so different from anything that I had had a right to expect; for when Fran\u00e7oise (who guessed that something extraordinary must have happened when she saw Mamma sitting by my side, holding my hand and letting me cry unchecked) said to her: \"But, Madame, what is little Master crying for?\" she replied: \"Why, Fran\u00e7oise, he doesn't know himself: it is his nerves. Make up the big bed for me quickly and then go off to your own.\" And thus for the first time my unhappiness was regarded no longer as a fault for which I must be punished, but as an involuntary evil which had been officially recognised a nervous condition for which I was in no way responsible: I had the consolation that I need no longer mingle apprehensive scruples with the bitterness of my tears; I could weep henceforward without sin. I felt no small degree of pride, either, in Franchise's presence at this return to humane conditions which, not an hour after Mamma had refused to come up to my room and had sent the snubbing message that I was to go to sleep, raised me to the dignity of a grown-up person, brought me of a sudden to a sort of puberty of sorrow, to emancipation from tears. I ought then to have been happy; I was not. It struck me that my mother had just made a first concession which must have been painful to her, that it was a first step down from the ideal she had formed for me, and that for the first time she, with all her courage, had to confess herself beaten. It struck me that if I had just scored a victory it was over her; that I had succeeded, as sickness or sorrow or age might have succeeded, in relaxing her will, in altering her judgment; that this evening opened a new era, must remain a black date in the calendar. And if I had dared now, I should have said to Mamma: \"No, I don't want you; you mustn't sleep here.\" But I was conscious of the practical wisdom, of what would be called nowadays the realism with which she tempered the ardent idealism of my grandmother's nature, and I knew that now the mischief was done she would prefer to let me enjoy the soothing pleasure of her company, and not to disturb my father again. Certainly my mother's beautiful features seemed to shine again with youth that evening, as she sat gently holding my hands and trying to check my tears; but, just for that reason, it seemed to me that this should not have happened; her anger would have been less difficult to endure than this new kindness which my childhood had not known; I felt that I had with an impious and secret finger traced a first wrinkle upon her soul and made the first white hair shew upon her head. This thought redoubled my sobs, and then I saw that Mamma, who had never allowed herself to go to any length of tenderness with me, was suddenly overcome by my tears and had to struggle to keep back her own. Then, as she saw that I had noticed this, she said to me, with a smile: \"Why, my little buttercup, my little canary-boy, he's going to make Mamma as silly as himself if this goes on. Look, since you can't sleep, and Mamma can't either, we mustn't go on in this stupid way; we must do something; I'll get one of your books.\" But I had none there. \"Would you like me to get out the books now that your grandmother is going to give you for your birthday? Just think it over first, and don't be disappointed if there is nothing new for you then.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was only too delighted, and Mamma went to find a parcel of books in which I could not distinguish, through the paper in which it was wrapped, any more than its squareness and size, but which, even at this first glimpse, brief and obscure as it was, bade fair to eclipse already the paint-box of last New Year's Day and the silkworms of the year before. It contained La Mare au Diable, Fran\u00e7ois le Champi, La Petite Fadette, and Les Ma\u00eetres Sonneurs. My grandmother, as I learned afterwards, had at first chosen Mussel's poems, a volume of Rousseau, and IndianaFran\u00e7ois le Champi, whose reddish cover and incomprehensible title gave it a distinct personality in my eyes and a mysterious attraction. I had not then read any real novels. I had heard it said that George Sand was a typical novelist. That prepared me in advance to imagine that Fran\u00e7ois le Champi contained something inexpressibly delicious. The course of the narrative, where it tended to arouse curiosity or melt to pity, certain modes of expression which disturb or sadden the reader, and which, with a little experience, he may recognise as 'common form' in novels, seemed to me then distinctive\u2014for to me a new book was not one of a number of similar objects, but was like an individual man, unmatched, and with no cause of existence beyond himself--an intoxicating whiff of the peculiar essence of Fran\u00e7ois le Champi. Beneath the everyday incidents, the commonplace thoughts and hackneyed words, I could hear, or overhear, an intonation, a rhythmic utterance fine and strange. The 'action' began: to me it seemed all the more obscure because in those days, when I read to myself, I used often, while I turned the pages, to dream of something quite different. And to the gaps which this habit made in my knowledge of the story more were added by the fact that when it was Mamma who was reading to me aloud she left all the love-scenes out. And so all the odd changes which take place in the relations between the miller's wife and the boy, changes which only the birth and growth of love can explain, seemed to me plunged and steeped in a mystery, the key to which (as I could readily believe) lay in that strange and pleasant-sounding name of Champi, which draped the boy who bore it, I knew not why, in its own bright colour, purpurate and charming. If my mother was not a faithful reader, she was, none the less, admirable when reading a work in which she found the note of true feeling by the respectful simplicity of her interpretation and by the sound of her sweet and gentle voice. It was the same in her daily life, when it was not works of art but men and women whom she was moved to pity or admire: it was touching to observe with what deference she would banish from her voice, her gestures, from her whole conversation, now the note of joy which might have distressed some mother who had long ago lost a child, now the recollection of an event or anniversary which might have reminded some old gentleman of the burden of his years, now the household topic which might have bored some young man of letters. And so, when she read aloud the prose of George Sand, prose which is everywhere redolent of that generosity and moral distinction which Mamma had learned from my grandmother to place above all other qualities in life, and which I was not to teach her until much later to refrain from placing, in the same way, above all other qualities in literature; taking pains to banish from her voice any weakness or affectation which might have blocked its channel for that powerful stream of language, she supplied all the natural tenderness, all the lavish sweetness which they demanded to phrases which seemed to have been composed for her voice, and which were all, so to speak, within her compass. She came to them with the tone that they required, with the cordial accent which existed before they were, which dictated them, but which is not to be found in the words themselves, and by these means she smoothed away, as she read on, any harshness there might be or discordance in the tenses of verbs, endowing the imperfect and the preterite with all the sweetness which there is in generosity, all the melancholy which there is in love; guided the sentence that was drawing to an end towards that which was waiting to begin, now hastening, now slackening the pace of the syllables so as to bring them, despite their difference of quantity, into a uniform rhythm, and breathed into this quite ordinary prose a kind of life, continuous and full of feeling.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My agony was soothed; I let myself be borne upon the current of this gentle night on which I had my mother by my side. I knew that such a night could not be repeated; that the strongest desire I had in the world, namely, to keep my mother in my room through the sad hours of darkness, ran too much counter to general requirements and to the wishes of others for such a concession as had been granted me this evening to be anything but a rare and casual exception. To-morrow night I should again be the victim of anguish and Mamma would not stay by my side. But when these storms of anguish grew calm I could no longer realise their existence; besides, tomorrow evening was still a long way off; I reminded myself that I should still have time to think about things, albeit that remission of time could bring me no access of power, albeit the coming event was in no way dependent upon the exercise of my will, and seemed not quite inevitable only because it was still separated from me by this short interval.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so it was that, for a long time afterwards, when I lay awake at night and revived old memories of Combray, I saw no more of it than this sort of luminous panel, sharply defined against a vague and shadowy background, like the panels which a Bengal fire or some electric sign will illuminate and dissect from the front of a building the other parts of which remain plunged in darkness: broad enough at its base, the little parlour, the dining-room, the alluring shadows of the path along which would come M. Swann, the unconscious author of my sufferings, the hall through which I would journey to the first step of that staircase, so hard to climb, which constituted, all by itself, the tapering 'elevation' of an irregular pyramid; and, at the summit, my bedroom, with the little passage through whose glazed door Mamma would enter; in a word, seen always at the same evening hour, isolated from all its possible surroundings, detached and solitary against its shadowy background, the bare minimum of scenery necessary (like the setting one sees printed at the head of an old play, for its performance in the provinces) to the drama of my undressing, as though all Combray had consisted of but two floors joined by a slender staircase, and as though there had been no time there but seven o'clock at night. I must own that I could have assured any questioner that Combray did include other scenes and did exist at other hours than these. But since the facts which I should then have recalled would have been prompted only by an exercise of the will, by my intellectual memory, and since the pictures which that kind of memory shews us of the past preserve nothing of the past itself, I should never have had any wish to ponder over this residue of Combray. To me it was in reality all dead.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Permanently dead? Very possibly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is a large element of hazard in these matters, and a second hazard, that of our own death, often prevents us from awaiting for any length of time the favours of the first.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I feel that there is much to be said for the Celtic belief that the souls of those whom we have lost are held captive in some inferior being, in an animal, in a plant, in some inanimate object, and so effectively lost to us until the day (which to many never comes) when we happen to pass by the tree or to obtain possession of the object which forms their prison. Then they start and tremble, they call us by our name, and as soon as we have recognised their voice the spell is broken. We have delivered them: they have overcome death and return to share our life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so it is with our own past. It is a labour in vain to attempt to recapture it: all the efforts of our intellect must prove futile. The past is hidden somewhere outside the realm, beyond the reach of intellect, in some material object (in the sensation which that material object will give us) which we do not suspect. And as for that object, it depends on chance whether we come upon it or not before we ourselves must die.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many years had elapsed during which nothing of Combray, save what was comprised in the theatre and the drama of my going to bed there, had any existence for me, when one day in winter, as I came home, my mother, seeing that I was cold, offered me some tea, a thing I did not ordinarily take. I declined at first, and then, for no particular reason, changed my mind. She sent out for one of those short, plump little cakes called 'petites madeleines,' which look as though they had been moulded in the fluted scallop of a pilgrim's shell. And soon, mechanically, weary after a dull day with the prospect of a depressing morrow, I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had soaked a morsel of the cake. No sooner had the warm liquid, and the crumbs with it, touched my palate than a shudder ran through my whole body, and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary changes that were taking place. An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses, but individual, detached, with no suggestion of its origin. And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me, its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory--this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has of filling me with a precious essence; or rather this essence was not in me, it was myself. I had ceased now to feel mediocre, accidental, mortal. Whence could it have come to me, this all-powerful joy? I was conscious that it was connected with the taste of tea and cake, but that it infinitely transcended those savours, could not, indeed, be of the same nature as theirs. Whence did it come? What did it signify? How could I seize upon and define it?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I drink a second mouthful, in which I find nothing more than in the first, a third, which gives me rather less than the second. It is time to stop; the potion is losing its magic. It is plain that the object of my quest, the truth, lies not in the cup but in myself. The tea has called up in me, but does not itself understand, and can only repeat indefinitely with a gradual loss of strength, the same testimony; which I, too, cannot interpret, though I hope at least to be able to call upon the tea for it again and to find it there presently, intact and at my disposal, for my final enlightenment. I put down my cup and examine my own mind. It is for it to discover the truth. But how? What an abyss of uncertainty whenever the mind feels that some part of it has strayed beyond its own borders; when it, the seeker, is at once the dark region through which it must go seeking, where all its equipment will avail it nothing. Seek? More than that: create. It is face to face with something which does not so far exist, to which it alone can give reality and substance, which it alone can bring into the light of day.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And I begin again to ask myself what it could have been, this unremembered state which brought with it no logical proof of its existence, but only the sense that it was a happy, that it was a real state in whose presence other states of consciousness melted and vanished. I decide to attempt to make it reappear. I retrace my thoughts to the moment at which I drank the first spoonful of tea. I find again the same state, illumined by no fresh light. I compel my mind to make one further effort, to follow and recapture once again the fleeting sensation. And that nothing may interrupt it in its course I shut out every obstacle, every extraneous idea, I stop my ears and inhibit all attention to the sounds which come from the next room. And then, feeling that my mind is growing fatigued without having any success to report, I compel it for a change to enjoy that distraction which I have just denied it, to think of other things, to rest and refresh itself before the supreme attempt. And then for the second time I clear an empty space in front of it. I place in position before my mind's eye the still recent taste of that first mouthful, and I feel something start within me, something that leaves its resting-place and attempts to rise, something that has been embedded like an anchor at a great depth; I do not know yet what it is, but I can feel it mounting slowly; I can measure the resistance, I can hear the echo of great spaces traversed.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Undoubtedly what is thus palpitating in the depths of my being must be the image, the visual memory which, being linked to that taste, has tried to follow it into my conscious mind. But its struggles are too far off, too much confused; scarcely can I perceive the colourless reflection in which are blended the uncapturable whirling medley of radiant hues, and I cannot distinguish its form, cannot invite it, as the one possible interpreter, to translate to me the evidence of its contemporary, its inseparable paramour, the taste of cake soaked in tea; cannot ask it to inform me what special circumstance is in question, of what period in my past life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Will it ultimately reach the clear surface of my consciousness, this memory, this old, dead moment which the magnetism of an identical moment has travelled so far to importune, to disturb, to raise up out of the very depths of my being? I cannot tell. Now that I feel nothing, it has stopped, has perhaps gone down again into its darkness, from which who can say whether it will ever rise? Ten times over I must essay the task, must lean down over the abyss. And each time the natural laziness which deters us from every difficult enterprise, every work of importance, has urged me to leave the thing alone, to drink my tea and to think merely of the worries of to-day and of my hopes for to-morrow, which let themselves be pondered over without effort or distress of mind.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And suddenly the memory returns. The taste was that of the little crumb of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray (because on those mornings I did not go out before church-time), when I went to say good day to her in her bedroom, my aunt L\u00e9onie used to give me, dipping it first in her own cup of real or of lime-flower tea. The sight of the little madeleine had recalled nothing to my mind before I tasted it; perhaps because I had so often seen such things in the interval, without tasting them, on the trays in pastry-cooks' windows, that their image had dissociated itself from those Combray days to take its place among others more recent; perhaps because of those memories, so long abandoned and put out of mind, nothing now survived, everything was scattered; the forms of things, including that of the little scallop-shell of pastry, so richly sensual under its severe, religious folds, were either obliterated or had been so long dormant as to have lost the power of expansion which would have allowed them to resume their place in my consciousness. But when from a long-distant past nothing subsists, after the people are dead, after the things are broken and scattered, still, alone, more fragile, but with more vitality, more unsubstantial, more persistent, more faithful, the smell and taste of things remain poised a long time, like souls, ready to remind us, waiting and hoping for their moment, amid the ruins of all the rest; and bear unfaltering, in the tiny and almost impalpable drop of their essence, the vast structure of recollection.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And once I had recognized the taste of the crumb of madeleine soaked in her decoction of lime-flowers which my aunt used to give me (although I did not yet know and must long postpone the discovery of why this memory made me so happy) immediately the old grey house upon the street, where her room was, rose up like the scenery of a theatre to attach itself to the little pavilion, opening on to the garden, which had been built out behind it for my parents (the isolated panel which until that moment had been all that I could see); and with the house the town, from morning to night and in all weathers, the Square where I was sent before luncheon, the streets along which I used to run errands, the country roads we took when it was fine. And just as the Japanese amuse themselves by filling a porcelain bowl with water and steeping in it little crumbs of paper which until then are without character or form, but, the moment they become wet, stretch themselves and bend, take on colour and distinctive shape, become flowers or houses or people, permanent and recognisable, so in that moment all the flowers in our garden and in M. Swann's park, and the water-lilies on the Vivonne and the good folk of the village and their little dwellings and the parish church and the whole of Combray and of its surroundings, taking their proper shapes and growing solid, sprang into being, town and gardens alike, from my cup of tea.9Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/810220", "artist_names": "Paul

PLACE-NAMES: THE PLACE\n\nMY FIRST VISIT TO BALBEC \u2014 FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF M. DE CHARLUS AND OF ROBERT DE SAINT-LOUP \u2014 DINNER WITH BLOCH AND HIS FAMILY\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had arrived at a state almost of complete indifference to Gilberte when, two years later, I went with my grandmother to Balbec. When I succumbed to the attraction of a strange face, when it was with the help of some other girl that I hoped to discover gothic cathedrals, the palaces and gardens of Italy, I said to myself sadly that this love of ours, in so far as it is love for one particular creature, is not perhaps a very real thing, since if the association of pleasant or unpleasant trains of thought can attach it for a time to a woman so as to make us believe that it has been inspired by her, in a necessary sequence of effect to cause, yet when we detach ourselves, deliberately or unconsciously, from those associations, this love, as though it were indeed a spontaneous thing and sprang from ourselves alone, will revive in order to bestow itself on another woman. At the time, however, of my departure for Balbec, and during the earlier part of my stay there, my indifference was still only intermittent. Often, our life being so careless of chronology, interpolating so many anachronisms in the sequence of our days, I lived still among those \u2014 far older days than yesterday or last week \u2014 in which I loved Gilberte. And at once not seeing her became as exquisite a torture to me as it had been then. The self that had loved her, which another self had already almost entirely supplanted, rose again in me, stimulated far more often by a trivial than by an important event. For instance, if I may anticipate for a moment my arrival in Normandy, I heard some one who passed me on the sea-front at Balbec refer to the \u2018Secretary to the Ministry of Posts and his family.\u2019 Now, seeing that as yet I knew nothing of the influence which that family was to exercise over my life, this remark ought to have passed unheeded; instead, it gave me at once an acute twinge, which a self that had for the most part long since been outgrown in me felt at being parted from Gilberte. Because I had never given another thought to a conversation which Gilberte had had with her father in my hearing, in which allusion was made to the Secretary to the Ministry of Posts and to his family. Now our love memories present no exception to the general rules of memory, which in turn are governed by the still more general rules of Habit. And as Habit weakens every impression, what a person recalls to us most vividly is precisely what we had forgotten, because it was of no importance, and had therefore left in full possession of its strength. That is why the better part of our memory exists outside ourselves, in a blatter of rain, in the smell of an unaired room or of the first crackling brushwood fire in a cold grate: wherever, in short, we happen upon what our mind, having no use for it, had rejected, the last treasure that the past has in store, the richest, that which when all our flow of tears seems to have dried at the source can make us weep again. Outside ourselves, did I say; rather within ourselves, but hidden from our eyes in an oblivion more or less prolonged. It is thanks to this oblivion alone that we can from time to time recover the creature that we were, range ourselves face to face with past events as that creature had to face them, suffer afresh because we are no longer ourselves but he, and because he loved what leaves us now indifferent. In the broad daylight of our ordinary memory the images of the past turn gradually pale and fade out of sight, nothing remains of them, we shall never find them again. Or rather we should never find them again had not a few words (such as this \u2018Secretary to the Ministry of Posts\u2019) been carefully locked away in oblivion, just as an author deposits in the National Library a copy of a book which might otherwise become unobtainable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this suffering and this recrudescence of my love for Gilberte lasted no longer than such things last in a dream, and this time, on the contrary, because at Balbec the old Habit was no longer there to keep them alive. And if these two effects of Habit appear to be incompatible, that is because Habit is bound by a diversity of laws. In Paris I had grown more and more indifferent to Gilberte, thanks to Habit. The change of habit, that is to say the temporary cessation of Habit, completed Habit\u2019s task when I started for Balbec. It weakens, but it stabilises; it leads to disintegration but it makes the scattered elements last indefinitely. Day after day, for years past, I had begun by modelling my state of mind, more or less effectively, upon that of the day before. At Balbec, a strange bed, to the side of which a tray was brought in the morning that differed from my Paris breakfast tray, could not, obviously, sustain the fancies upon which my love for Gilberte had fed: there are cases (though not, I admit, commonly) in which, one\u2019s days being paralysed by a sedentary life, the best way to save time is to change one\u2019s place of residence. My journey to Balbec was like the first outing of a convalescent who needed only that to convince him that he was cured\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The journey was one that would now be made, probably, in a motorcar, which would be supposed to render it more interesting. We shall see too that, accomplished in such a way, it would even be in a sense more genuine, since one would be following more nearly, in a closer intimacy, the various contours by which the surface of the earth is wrinkled. But after all the special attraction of the journey lies not in our being able to alight at places on the way and to stop altogether as soon as we grow tired, but in its making the difference between departure and arrival not as imperceptible but as intense as possible, so that we are conscious of it in its totality, intact, as it existed in our mind when imagination bore us from the place in which we were living right to the very heart of a place we longed to see, in a single sweep which seemed miraculous to us not so much because it covered a certain distance as because it united two distinct individualities of the world, took us from one name to another name; and this difference is accentuated (more than in a form of locomotion in which, since one can stop and alight where one chooses, there can scarcely be said to be any point of arrival) by the mysterious operation that is performed in those peculiar places, railway stations, which do not constitute, so to speak, a part of the surrounding town but contain the essence of its personality just as upon their sign-boards they bear its painted name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But in this respect as in every other, our age is infected with a mania for shewing things only in the environment that properly belongs to them, thereby suppressing the essential thing, the act of the mind which isolated them from that environment. A picture is nowadays \u2018presented\u2019 in the midst of furniture, ornaments, hangings of the same period, a secondhand scheme of decoration in the composition of which in the houses of to-day excels that same hostess who but yesterday was so crassly ignorant, but now spends her time poring over records and in libraries; and among these the masterpiece at which we glance up from the table while we dine does not give us that exhilarating delight which we can expect from it only in a public gallery, which symbolises far better by its bareness, by the absence of all irritating detail, those innermost spaces into which the artist withdrew to create it\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unhappily those marvellous places which are railway stations, from which one sets out for a remote destination, are tragic places also, for if in them the miracle is accomplished whereby scenes which hitherto have had no existence save in our minds are to become the scenes among which we shall be living, for that very reason we must, as we emerge from the waiting-room, abandon any thought of finding ourself once again within the familiar walls which, but a moment ago, were still enclosing us. We must lay aside all hope of going home to sleep in our own bed, once we have made up our mind to penetrate into the pestiferous cavern through which we may have access to the mystery, into one of those vast, glass-roofed sheds, like that of Saint-Lazare into which I must go to find the train for Balbec, and which extended over the rent bowels of the city one of those bleak and boundless skies, heavy with an accumulation of dramatic menaces, like certain skies painted with an almost Parisian modernity by Mantegna or Veronese, beneath which could be accomplished only some solemn and tremendous act, such as a departure by train or the Elevation of the Cross\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So long as I had been content to look out from the warmth of my own bed in Paris at the Persian church of Balbec, shrouded in driving sleet, no sort of objection to this journey had been offered by my body. Its objections began only when it had gathered that it would have itself to take part in the journey, and that on the evening of my arrival I should be shewn to \u2018my\u2019 room which to my body would be unknown. Its revolt was all the more deep-rooted in that on the very eve of my departure I learned that my mother would not be coming with us, my father, who would be kept busy at the Ministry until it was time for him to start for Spain with M. de Norpois, having preferred to take a house in the neighbourhood of Paris. On the other hand, the spectacle of Balbec seemed to me none the less desirable because I must purchase it at the price of a discomfort which, on the contrary, I felt to indicate and to guarantee the reality of the impression which I was going there to seek, an impression the place of which no spectacle of professedly equal value, no \u2018panorama\u2019 which I might have gone to see without being thereby precluded from returning home to sleep in my own bed, could possibly have filled. It was not for the first time that I felt that those who love and those who find pleasure are not always the same. I believed myself to be longing fully as much for Balbec as the doctor who was treating me, when he said to me, surprised, on the morning of our departure, to see me look so unhappy, \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you that if I could only manage a week to go down and get a blow by the sea, I shouldn\u2019t wait to be asked twice. You\u2019ll be having races, regattas; you don\u2019t know what all!\u201d But I had already learned the lesson \u2014 long before I was taken to hear Berma \u2014 that, whatever it might be that I loved, it would never be attained save at the end of a long and heart-rending pursuit, in the course of which I should have first to sacrifice my own pleasure to that paramount good instead of seeking it there\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother, naturally enough, looked upon our exodus from a somewhat different point of view, and (for she was still as anxious as ever that the presents which were made me should take some artistic form) had planned, so that she might be offering me, of this journey, a \u2018print\u2019 that was, at least, in parts \u2018old,\u2019 that we should repeat, partly by rail and partly by road, the itinerary that Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 followed when she went from Paris to \u2018L\u2019Orient\u2019 by way of Chaulnes and \u2018the Pont-Audemer.\u2019 But my grandmother had been obliged to abandon this project, at the instance of my father who knew, whenever she organised any expedition with a view to extracting from it the utmost intellectual benefit that it was capable of yielding, what a tale there would be to tell of missed trains, lost luggage, sore throats and broken rules. She was free at least to rejoice in the thought that never, when the time came for us to sally forth to the beach, should we be exposed to the risk of being kept indoors by the sudden appearance of what her beloved S\u00e9vign\u00e9 calls a \u2018beast of a coachload,\u2019 since we should know not a soul at Balbec, Legrandin having refrained from offering us a letter of introduction to his sister. (This abstention had not been so well appreciated by my aunts C\u00e9line and Flora, who, having known as a child that lady, of whom they had always spoken until then, to commemorate this early intimacy, as \u2018Ren\u00e9e de Cambremer,\u2019 and having had from her and still possessing a number of those little presents which continue to ornament a room or a conversation but to which the feeling between the parties no longer corresponds, imagined that they were avenging the insult offered to us by never uttering again, when they called upon Mme. Legrandin, the name of her daughter, confining themselves to a mutual congratulation, once they were safely out of the house: \u201cI made no reference to you know whom!\u201d \u201cI think that went home!\u201d)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so we were simply to leave Paris by that one twenty-two train which I had too often beguiled myself by looking out in the railway timetable, where its itinerary never failed to give me the emotion, almost the illusion of starting by it, not to feel that I already knew it. As the delineation in our mind of the features of any form of happiness depends more on the nature of the longings that it inspires in us than on the accuracy of the information which we have about it, I felt that I knew this train in all its details, nor did I doubt that I should feel, sitting in one of its compartments, a special delight as the day began to cool, should be contemplating this or that view as the train approached one or another station; so much so that this train, which always brought to my mind\u2019s eye the images of the same towns, which I bathed in the sunlight of those post-meridian hours through which it sped, seemed to me to be different from every other train; and I had ended \u2014 as we are apt to do with a person whom we have never seen but of whom we like to believe that we have won his friendship \u2014 by giving a distinct and unalterable cast of countenance to the traveller, artistic, golden-haired, who would thus have taken me with him upon his journey, and to whom I should bid farewell beneath the Cathedral of Saint-Lo, before he hastened to overtake the setting sun\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As my grandmother could not bring herself to do anything so \u2018stupid\u2019 as to go straight to Balbec, she was to break the journey half-way, staying the night with one of her friends, from whose house I was to proceed the same evening, so as not to be in the way there and also in order that I might arrive by daylight and see Balbec Church, which, we had learned, was at some distance from Balbec-Plage, so that I might not have a chance to visit it later on, when I had begun my course of baths. And perhaps it was less painful for me to feel that the desirable goal of my journey stood between me and that cruel first night on which I should have to enter a new habitation, and consent to dwell there. But I had had first to leave the old; my mother had arranged to \u2018move in,\u2019 that afternoon, at Saint-Cloud, and had made, or pretended to make, all the arrangements for going there directly after she had seen us off at the station, without needing to call again at our own house to which she was afraid that I might otherwise feel impelled at the last moment, instead of going to Balbec, to return with her. In fact, on the pretext of having so much to see to in the house which she had just taken and of being pressed for time, but in reality so as to spare me the cruel ordeal of a long-drawn parting, she had decided not to wait with us until that moment of the signal to start at which, concealed hitherto among ineffective comings and goings and preparations that lead to nothing definite, separation is made suddenly manifest, impossible to endure when it is no longer possibly to be avoided, concentrated in its entirety in one enormous instant of impotent and supreme lucidity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the first time I began to feel that it was possible that my mother might live without me, otherwise than for me, a separate life. She was going to stay with my father, whose existence it may have seemed to her that my feeble health, my nervous excitability complicated somewhat and saddened. This separation made me all the more wretched because I told myself that it probably marked for my mother an end of the successive disappointments which I had caused her, of which she had never said a word to me but which had made her realise the difficulty of our taking our holidays together; and perhaps also the first trial of a form of existence to which she was beginning, now, to resign herself for the future, as the years crept on for my father and herself, an existence in which I should see less of her, in which (a thing that not even in my nightmares had yet been revealed to me) she would already have become something of a stranger, a lady who might be seen going home by herself to a house in which I should not be, asking the porter whether there was not a letter for her from me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could scarcely answer the man in the station who offered to take my bag. My mother, to comfort me, tried the methods which seemed to her most efficacious. Thinking it to be useless to appear not to notice my unhappiness, she gently teased me about it:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, and what would Balbec church say if it knew that people pulled long faces like that when they were going to see it? Surely this is not the enraptured tourist Ruskin speaks of. Besides, I shall know if you rise to the occasion, even when we are miles apart I shall still be with my little man. You shall have a letter to-morrow from Mamma.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear,\u201d said my grandmother, \u201cI picture you like Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, your eyes glued to the map, and never losing sight of us for an instant.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then Mamma sought to distract my mind, asked me what I thought of having for dinner, drew my attention to Fran\u00e7oise, complimented her on a hat and cloak which she did not recognise, in spite of their having horrified her long ago when she first saw them, new, upon my great-aunt, one with an immense bird towering over it, the other decorated with a hideous pattern and jet beads. But the cloak having grown too shabby to wear, Fran\u00e7oise had had it turned, exposing an \u2018inside\u2019 of plain cloth and quite a good colour. As for the bird, it had long since come to grief and been thrown away. And just as it is disturbing, sometimes, to find the effects which the most conscious artists attain only by an effort occurring in a folk-song, on the wall of some peasant\u2019s cottage where above the door, at the precisely right spot in the composition, blooms a white or yellow rose \u2014 so the velvet band, the loop of ribbon which would have delighted one in a portrait by Chardin or Whistler, Fran\u00e7oise had set with a simple but unerring taste upon the hat, which was now charming\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To take a parallel from an earlier age, the modesty and integrity which often gave an air of nobility to the face of our old servant having spread also to the garments which, as a woman reserved but not humbled, who knew how to hold her own and to keep her place, she had put on for the journey so as to be fit to be seen in our company without at the same time seeming or wishing to make herself conspicuous \u2014 Fran\u00e7oise in the cherry-coloured cloth, now faded, of her cloak, and the discreet nap of her fur collar, brought to mind one of those miniatures of Anne of Brittany painted in Books of Hours by an old master, in which everything is so exactly in the right place, the sense of the whole is so evenly distributed throughout the parts that the rich and obsolete singularity of the costume expresses the same pious gravity as the eyes, lips and hands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of thought, in relation to Fran\u00e7oise, one could hardly speak. She knew nothing, in that absolute sense in which to know nothing means to understand nothing, save the rare truths to which the heart is capable of directly attaining. The vast world of ideas existed not for her. But when one studied the clearness of her gaze, the lines of nose and lips, all those signs lacking from so many people of culture in whom they would else have signified a supreme distinction, the noble detachment of a chosen spirit, one was disquieted, as one is by the frank, intelligent eyes of a dog, to which, nevertheless, one knows that all our human concepts must be alien, and was led to ask oneself whether there might not be, among those other humble brethren, our peasant countrymen, creatures who were, like the great ones of the earth, of simple mind, or rather, doomed by a harsh fate to live among the simple-minded, deprived of heavenly light, were yet more naturally, more instinctively akin to the chosen spirits than most educated people, were, so to speak, all members, though scattered, straying, robbed of their heritage of reason, of the celestial family, kinsfolk, that have been lost in infancy, of the loftiest minds to whom \u2014 as is apparent from the unmistakable light in their eyes, although they can concentrate that light on nothing \u2014 there has been lacking, to endow them with talent, knowledge only\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother, seeing that I had difficulty in keeping back my tears, said to me: \u201c\u2018Regulus was in the habit, when things looked grave. . . . \u2019 Besides, it isn\u2019t nice for Mamma! What does Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 say? Your grandmother will tell you: \u2018I shall be obliged to draw upon all the courage that you lack.\u2019\u201d And remembering that affection for another distracts one\u2019s selfish griefs, she endeavoured to beguile me by telling me that she expected the removal to Saint-Cloud to go without a hitch, that she liked the cab, which she had kept waiting, that the driver seemed civil and the seats comfortable. I made an effort to smile at these trifles, and bowed my head with an air of acquiescence and satisfaction. But they helped me only to depict to myself with more accuracy Mamma\u2019s imminent departure, and it was with an agonised heart that I gazed at her as though she were already torn from me, beneath that wide-brimmed straw hat which she had bought to wear in the country, in a flimsy dress which she had put on in view of the long drive through the sweltering midday heat; hat and dress making her some one else, some one who belonged already to the Villa Montretout, in which I should not see her\nYou might also like\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To prevent the choking fits which the journey might otherwise give me the doctor had advised me to take, as we started, a good stiff dose of beer or brandy, so as to begin the journey in a state of what he called \u2018euphoria,\u2019 in which the nervous system is for a time less vulnerable. I had not yet made up my mind whether I should do this, but I wished at least that my grandmother should admit that, if I did so decide, I should have wisdom and authority on my side. I spoke therefore as if my hesitation were concerned only with where I should go for my drink, to the bar on the platform or to the restaurant-car on the train. But immediately, at the air of reproach which my grandmother\u2019s face assumed, an air of not wishing even to entertain such an idea for a moment, \u201cWhat!\u201d I said to myself, suddenly determining upon this action of going out to drink, the performance of which became necessary as a proof of my independence since the verbal announcement of it had not succeeded in passing unchallenged, \u201cWhat! You know how ill I am, you know what the doctor ordered, and you treat me like this!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I had explained to my grandmother how unwell I felt, her distress, her kindness were so apparent as she replied, \u201cRun along then, quickly; get yourself some beer or a liqueur if it will do you any good,\u201d that I flung myself upon her, almost smothering her in kisses. And if after that I went and drank a great deal too much in the restaurant-car of the train, that was because I felt that otherwise I should have a more violent attack than usual, which was just what would vex her most. When at the first stop I clambered back into our compartment I told my grandmother how pleased I was to be going to Balbec, that I felt that everything would go off splendidly, that after all I should soon grow used to being without Mamma, that the train was most comfortable, the steward and attendants in the bar so friendly that I should like to make the journey often so as to have opportunities of seeing them again. My grandmother, however, did not appear to feel the same joy as myself at all these good tidings. She answered, without looking me in the face:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to get a little sleep?\u201d and turned her gaze to the window, the blind of which, though we had drawn it, did not completely cover the glass, so that the sun could and did slip in over the polished oak of the door and the cloth of the seat (like an advertisement of a life shared with nature far more persuasive than those posted higher upon the walls of the compartment, by the railway company, representing places in the country the names of which I could not make out from where I sat) the same warm and slumberous light which lies along a forest glade\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But when my grandmother thought that my eyes were shut I could see her, now and again, from among the large black spots on her veil, steal a glance at me, then withdraw it, and steal back again, like a person trying to make himself, so as to get into the habit, perform some exercise that hurts him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thereupon I spoke to her, but that seemed not to please her either. And yet to myself the sound of my own voice was pleasant, as were the most imperceptible, the most internal movements of my body. And so I endeavoured to prolong it. I allowed each of my inflexions to hang lazily upon its word, I felt each glance from my eyes arrive just at the spot to which it was directed and stay there beyond the normal period. \u201cNow, now, sit still and rest,\u201d said my grandmother. \u201cIf you can\u2019t manage to sleep, read something.\u201d And she handed me a volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 which I opened, while she buried herself in the M\u00e9moires de Madame de Beausergent. She never travelled anywhere without a volume of each. They were her two favourite authors. With no conscious movement of my head, feeling a keen pleasure in maintaining a posture after I had adopted it, I lay back holding in my hands the volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 which I had allowed to close, without lowering my eyes to it, or indeed letting them see anything but the blue window-blind. But the contemplation of this blind appeared to me an admirable thing, and I should not have troubled to answer anyone who might have sought to distract me from contemplating it. The blue colour of this blind seemed to me, not perhaps by its beauty but by its intense vivacity, to efface so completely all the colours that had passed before my eyes from the day of my birth up to the moment in which I had gulped down the last of my drink and it had begun to take effect, that when compared with this blue they were as drab, as void as must be retrospectively the darkness in which he has lived to a man born blind whom a subsequent operation has at length enabled to see and to distinguish colours. An old ticket-collector came to ask for our tickets. The silvery gleam that shone from the metal buttons of his jacket charmed me in spite of my absorption. I wanted to ask him to sit down beside us. But he passed on to the next carriage, and I thought with longing of the life led by railwaymen for whom, since they spent all their time on the line, hardly a day could pass without their seeing this\u2019 old collector. The pleasure that I found in staring at the blind, and in feeling that my mouth was half-open, began at length to diminish. I became more mobile; I even moved in my seat; I opened the book that my grandmother had given me and turned its pages casually, reading whatever caught my eye. And as I read I felt my admiration for Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 grow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is a mistake to let oneself be taken in by the purely formal details, idioms of the period or social conventions, the effect of which is that certain people believe that they have caught the S\u00e9vign\u00e9 manner when they have said: \u201cTell me, my dear,\u201d or \u201cThat Count struck me as being a man of parts,\u201d or \u201cHaymaking is the sweetest thing in the world.\u201d Mme. de Simiane imagines already that she is being like her grandmother because she can write: \u201cM. de la Boulie is bearing wonderfully, Sir, and is in excellent condition to hear the news of his death,\u201d or \u201cOh, my dear Marquis, how your letter enchanted me! What can I do but answer it?\u201d or \u201cMeseems, Sir, that you owe me a letter, and I owe you some boxes of bergamot. I discharge my debt to the number of eight; others shall follow. . . . Never has the soil borne so many. Apparently for your gratification.\u201d And she writes in this style also her letter on bleeding, on lemons and so forth, supposing it to be typical of the letters of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. But my grandmother who had approached that lady from within, attracted to her by her own love of kinsfolk and of nature, had taught me to enjoy the real beauties of her correspondence, which are altogether different. They were presently to strike me all the more forcibly inasmuch as Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 is a great artist of the same school as a painter whom I was to meet at Balbec, where his influence on my way of seeing things was immense. I realised at Balbec that it was in the same way as he that she presented things to her readers, in the order of our perception of them, instead of first having to explain them in relation to their several causes. But already that afternoon in the railway carriage, as I read over again that letter in which the moonlight comes: \u201cI cannot resist the temptation: I put on all my bonnets and veils, though there is no need of them, I walk along this mall, where the air is as sweet as in my chamber; I find a thousand phantasms, monks white and black, sisters grey and white, linen cast here and there on the ground, men enshrouded upright against the tree-trunks,\u201d I was enraptured by what, a little later, I should have described (for does not she draw landscapes in the same way as he draws characters?) as the Dostoievsky side of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9\u2018s Letters\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, that evening, after having accompanied my grandmother to her destination and spent some hours in her friend\u2019s house, I had returned by myself to the train, at any rate I found nothing to distress me in the night which followed; this was because I had not to spend it in a room the somnolence of which would have kept me awake; I was surrounded by the soothing activity of all those movements of the train which kept me company, offered to stay and converse with me if I could not sleep, lulled me with their sounds which I wedded \u2014 as I had often wedded the chime of the Combray bells \u2014 now to one rhythm, now to another (hearing as the whim took me first four level and equivalent semi-quavers, then one semi-quaver furiously dashing against a crotchet); they neutralised the centrifugal force of my insomnia by exercising upon it a contrary pressure which kept me in equilibrium and on which my immobility and presently my drowsiness felt themselves to be borne with the same sense of refreshment that I should have had, had I been resting under the protecting vigilance of powerful forces, on the breast of nature and of life, had I been able for a moment to incarnate myself in a fish that sleeps in the sea, driven unheeding by the currents and the tides, or in an eagle outstretched upon the air, with no support but the storm\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sunrise is a necessary concomitant of long railway journeys, just as are hard-boiled eggs, illustrated papers, packs of cards, rivers upon which boats strain but make no progress. At a certain moment \u2014 when I was counting over the thoughts that had filled my mind, in the preceding minutes, so as to discover whether I had just been asleep or not (and when the very uncertainty which made me ask myself the question was to furnish me with an affirmative answer), in the pale square of the window, over a small black wood I saw some ragged clouds whose fleecy edges were of a fixed, dead pink, not liable to change, like the colour that dyes the wing which has grown to wear it, or the sketch upon which the artist\u2019s fancy has washed it. But I felt that, unlike them, this colour was due neither to inertia nor to caprice but to necessity and life. Presently there gathered behind it reserves of light. It brightened; the sky turned to a crimson which I strove, gluing my eyes to the window, to see more clearly, for I felt that it was related somehow to the most intimate life of Nature, but, the course of the line altering, the train turned, the morning scene gave place in the frame of the window to a nocturnal village, its roofs still blue with moonlight, its pond encrusted with the opalescent nacre of night, beneath a firmament still powdered with all its stars, and I was lamenting the loss of my strip of pink sky when I caught sight of it afresh, but red this time, in the opposite window which it left at a second bend in the line, so that I spent my time running from one window to the other to reassemble, to collect oh a single canvas the intermittent, antipodean fragments of my fine, scarlet, ever-changing morning, and to obtain a comprehensive view of it and a continuous picture\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scenery became broken, abrupt, the train stopped at a little station between two mountains. Far down the gorge, on the edge of a hurrying Stream, one could see only a solitary watch-house, deep-planted in the water which ran past on a level with its windows. If a person can be the product of a soil the peculiar charm of which one distinguishes in that person, more even than the peasant girl whom I had so desperately longed to see appear when I wandered by myself along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, in the woods of Roussainville, such a person must be the big girl whom I now saw emerge from the house and, climbing a path lighted by the first slanting rays of the sun, come towards the station carrying a jar of milk. In her valley from which its congregated summits hid the rest of the world, she could never see anyone save in these trains which stopped for a moment only. She passed down the line of windows, offering coffee and milk to a few awakened passengers. Purpled with the glow of morning, her face was rosier than the sky. I felt in her presence that desire to live which is reborn in us whenever we become conscious anew of beauty and of happiness. We invariably forget that these are individual qualities, and, substituting for them in our mind a conventional type at which we arrive by striking a sort of mean amongst the different faces that have taken our fancy, the pleasures we have known, we are left with mere abstract images which are lifeless and dull because they are lacking in precisely that element of novelty, different from anything we have known, that element which is proper to beauty and to happiness. And we deliver on life a pessimistic judgment which we suppose to be fair, for we believed that we were taking into account when we formed it happiness and beauty, whereas in fact we left them out and replaced them by syntheses in which there is not a single atom of either. So it is that a well-read man will at once begin to yawn with boredom when anyone speaks to him of a new \u2018good book,\u2019 because he imagines a sort of composite of all the good books that he has read and knows already, whereas a good book is something special, something incalculable, and is made up not of the sum of all previous masterpieces but of something which the most thorough assimilation of every one of them would not enable him to discover, since it exists not in their sum but beyond it. Once he has become acquainted with this new work, the well-read man, till then apathetic, feels his interest awaken in the reality which it depicts. So, alien to the models of beauty which my fancy was won't to sketch when I was by myself, this strapping girl gave me at once the sensation of a certain happiness (the sole form, always different, in which we may learn the sensation of happiness), of a happiness that would be realised by my staying and living there by her side. But in this again the temporary cessation of Habit played a great part. I was giving the milk-girl the benefit of what was really my own entire being, ready to taste the keenest joys, which now confronted her. As a rule it is with our being reduced to a minimum that we live, most of our faculties lie dormant because they can rely upon Habit, which knows what there is to be done and has no need of their services. But on this morning of travel, the interruption of the routine of my existence, the change of place and time, had made their presence indispensable. My habits, which were sedentary and not matutinal, played me false, and all my faculties came hurrying to take their place, vying with one another in their zeal, rising, each of them, like waves in a storm, to the same unaccustomed level, from the basest to the most exalted, from breath, appetite, the circulation of my blood to receptivity and imagination. I cannot say whether, so as to make me believe that this girl was unlike the rest of women, the rugged charm of these barren tracts had been added to her own, but if so she gave it back to them. Life would have seemed an exquisite thing to me if only I had been free to spend it, hour after hour, with her, to go with her to the stream, to the cow, to the train, to be always at her side, to feel that I was known to her, had my place in her thoughts. She would have initiated me into the delights of country life and of the first hours of the day. I signalled to her to give me some of her coffee. I felt that I must be noticed by her. She did not see me; I called to her. Above her body, which was of massive build, the complexion of her face was so burnished and so ruddy that she appeared almost as though I were looking at her through a lighted window. She had turned and was coming towards me; I could not take my eyes from her face which grew larger as she approached, like a sun which it was somehow possible to arrest in its course and draw towards one, letting itself be seen at close quarters, blinding the eyes with its blaze of red and gold. She fastened on me her penetrating stare, but while the porters ran along the platform shutting doors the train had begun to move. I saw her leave the station and go down the hill to her home; it was broad daylight now; I was speeding away from the dawn. Whether my exaltation had been produced by this girl or had on the other hand been responsible for most of the pleasure that I had found in the sight of her, in the sense of her presence, in either event she was so closely associated with it that my desire to see her again was really not so much a physical as a mental desire, not to allow this state of enthusiasm to perish utterly, not to be separated for ever from the person who, although quite unconsciously, had participated in it. It was not only because this state was a pleasant one. It was principally because (just as increased tension upon a cord or accelerated vibration of a nerve produces a different sound or colour) it gave another tonality to all that I saw, introduced me as an actor upon the stage of an unknown and infinitely more interesting universe; that handsome girl whom I still could see, while the train gathered speed, was like part of a life other than the life that I knew, separated from it by a clear boundary, in which the sensations that things produced in me were no longer the same, from which to return now to my old life would be almost suicide. To procure myself the pleasure of feeling that I had at least an attachment to this new life, it would suffice that I should live near enough to the little station to be able to come to it every morning for a cup of coffee from the girl. But alas, she must be for ever absent from the other life towards which I was being borne with ever increasing swiftness, a life to the prospect of which I resigned myself only by weaving plans that would enable me to take the same train again some day and to stop at the same station, a project which would have the further advantage of providing with subject matter the selfish, active, practical, mechanical, indolent, centrifugal tendency which is that of the human mind; for our mind turns readily aside from the effort which is required if it is to analyse in itself, in a general and disinterested manner, a pleasant impression which we have received. And as, on the other hand, we wish to continue to think of that impression, the mind prefers to imagine it in the future tense, which while it gives us no clue as to the real nature of the thing, saves us the trouble of recreating it in our own consciousness and allows us to hope that we may receive it afresh from without\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certain names of towns, Vezelay or Chartres, Bourses or Beauvais, serve to indicate, by abbreviation, the principal church in those towns. This partial acceptation, in which we are so accustomed to take the word, comes at length \u2014 if the names in question are those of places that we do not yet know \u2014 to fashion for us a mould of the name as a solid whole, which from that time onwards, whenever we wish it to convey the idea of the town \u2014 of that town which we have never seen \u2014 will impose on it, as on a cast, the same carved outlines, in the same style of art, will make of the town a sort of vast cathedral. It was, nevertheless, in a railway-station, above the door of a refreshment-room, that I read the name \u2014 almost Persian in style \u2014 of Balbec. I strode buoyantly through the station and across the avenue that led past it, I asked my way to the beach so as to see nothing in the place but its church and the sea; people seemed not to understand what I meant. Old Balbec, Balbec-en-Terre, at which I had arrived, had neither beach nor harbour. It was, most certainly, in the sea that the fishermen had found, according to the legend, the miraculous Christ, of which a window in the church that stood a few yards from where I now was recorded the discovery; it was indeed from cliffs battered by the waves that had been quarried the stone of its navfc and towers. But this sea, which for those reasons I had imagined as flowing up to die at the foot of the window, was twelve miles away and more, at Balbec-Plage, and, rising beside its cupola, that steeple, which, because I had read that it was itself a rugged Norman cliff on which seeds were blown and sprouted, round which the sea-birds wheeled, I had always pictured to myself as receiving at its base the last drying foam of the uplifted waves, stood on a Square from which two lines of tramway diverged, opposite a Caf\u00e9 which bore, written in letters of gold, the word \u2018Billiards\u2019; it stood out against a background of houses with the roofs of which no upstanding mast was blended. And the church \u2014 entering my mind with the Caf\u00e9, with the passing stranger of whom I had had to ask my way, with the station to which presently I should have to return \u2014 made part of the general whole, seemed an accident, a by-product of this summer afternoon, in which its mellow and distended dome against the sky was like a fruit of which the same light that bathed the chimneys of the houses was ripening the skin, pink, glowing, melting-soft. But I wished only to consider the eternal significance of the carvings when I recognised the Apostles, which I had seen in casts in the Trocad\u00e9ro museum, and which on either side of the Virgin, before the deep bay of the porch, were awaiting me as though to do me reverence. With their benign, blunt, mild faces and bowed shoulders they seemed to be advancing upon me with an air of welcome, singing the Alleluia of a fine day. But it was evident that their expression was unchanging as that on a dead man\u2019s face, and could be modified only by my turning about to look at them in different aspects. I said to myself: \u201cHere I am: this is the Church of Balbec. This square, which looks as though it were conscious of its glory, is the only place in the world that possesses Balbec Church. All that I have seen so far have been photographs of this church \u2014 and of these famous Apostles, this Virgin of the Porch, mere casts only. Now it is the church itself, the statue itself; these are they; they, the unique things \u2014 this is something far greater.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was something less, perhaps, also. As a young man on the day of an examination or of a duel feels the question that he has been asked, the shot that he has fired, to be a very little thing when he thinks of the reserves of knowledge and of valour that he possesses and would like to have displayed, so my mind, which had exalted the Virgin of the Porch far above the reproductions that I had had before my eyes, inaccessible by the vicissitudes which had power to threaten them, intact although they were destroyed, ideal, endowed with universal value, was astonished to see the statue which it had carved a thousand times, reduced now to its own apparent form in stone, occupying, on the radius of my outstretched arm, a place in which it had for rivals an election placard and the point of my stick, fettered to the Square, inseparable from the head of the main street, powerless to hide from the gaze of the Caf\u00e9 and of the omnibus office, receiving on its face half of that ray of the setting sun (half, presently, in a few hours\u2019 time, of the light of the street lamp) of which the Bank building received the other half, tainted simultaneously with that branch office of a money-lending establishment by the smells from the pastry-cook\u2019s oven, subjected to the tyranny of the Individual to such a point that, if I had chosen to scribble my name upon that stone, it was she, the illustrious Virgin whom until then I had endowed with a general existence and an intangible beauty, the Virgin of Balbec, the unique (which meant, alas, the only one) who, on her body coated with the same soot as defiled the neighbouring houses, would have displayed \u2014 powerless to rid herself of them \u2014 to all the admiring strangers come there to gaze upon her, the marks of my piece of chalk and the letters of my name; it was she, indeed, the immortal work of art, so long desired, whom I found, transformed, as was the church itself, into a little old woman in stone whose height I could measure and count her wrinkles. But time was passing; I must return to the station, where I was to wait for my grandmother and Fran\u00e7oise, so that we should all arrive at Balbec-Plage together. I reminded myself of what I had read about Balbec, of Swann\u2019s saying: \u201cIt is exquisite; as fine as Siena.\u201d And casting the blame for my disappointment upon various accidental causes, such as the state of my health, my exhaustion after the journey, my incapacity for looking at things properly, I endeavoured to console myself with the thought that other towns remained still intact for me, that I might soon, perhaps, be making my way, as into a shower of pearls, into the cool pattering sound that dripped from Quimperl\u00e9, cross that green water lit by a rosy glow in which Pont-Aven was bathed; but as for Balbec, no sooner had I set foot in it than it was as though I had broken open a name which ought to have been kept hermetically closed, and into which, seizing at once the opportunity that I had imprudently given them when I expelled all the images that had been living in it until then, a tramway, a Caf\u00e9, people crossing the square, the local branch of a Bank, irresistibly propelled by some external pressure, by a pneumatic force, had come crowding into the interior of those two syllables which, closing over them, let them now serve as a border to the porch of the Persian church, and would never henceforward cease to contain them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the little train of the local railway company which was to take us to Balbec-Plage I found my grandmother, but found her alone \u2014 for, imagining that she was sending Fran\u00e7oise on ahead of her, so as to have everything ready before we arrived, but having mixed up her instructions, she had succeeded only in packing off Fran\u00e7oise in the wrong direction, who at that moment was being carried down all unsuspectingly, at full speed, to Nantes, and would probably wake up next morning at Bordeaux. No sooner had I taken my seat in the carriage, filled with the fleeting light of sunset and with the lingering heat of the afternoon (the former enabling me, alas, to see written clearly upon my grandmother\u2019s face how much the latter had tired her), than she began: \u201cWell, and Balbec?\u201d with a smile so brightly illuminated by her expectation of the great pleasure which she supposed me to have been enjoying that I dared not at once confess to her my disappointment. Besides, the impression which my mind had been seeking occupied it steadily less as the place drew nearer to which my body would have to become accustomed. At the end \u2014 still more than an hour away \u2014 of this journey I was trying to form a picture of the manager of the hotel at Balbec, to whom I, at that moment, did not exist, and I should have liked to be going to present myself to him in more impressive company than that of my grandmother, who would be certain to ask for a reduction of his terms. The only thing positive about him was his haughty condescension; his lineaments were still vague\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every few minutes the little train brought us to a standstill in one of the stations which came before Balbec-Plage, stations the mere names of which (Incarville, Marcouville, Doville, Pont-a-Couleuvre, Arambouville, Saint-Mars-le-Vieux, Hermonville, Maineville) seemed to me outlandish, whereas if I had come upon them in a book I should at once have been struck by their affinity to the names of certain places in the neighbourhood of Combray. But to the trained ear two musical airs, consisting each of so many notes, several of which are common to them both, will present no similarity whatever if they differ in the colour of their harmony and orchestration. So it was that nothing could have reminded me less than these dreary names, made up of sand, of space too airy and empty and of salt, out of which the termination \u2018ville\u2019 always escaped, as the \u2018fly\u2019 seems to spring out from the end of the word \u2018butterfly\u2019\u2014 nothing could have reminded me less of those other names, Roussainville or Martinville, which, because I had heard them pronounced so often by my great-aunt at table, in the dining-room, had acquired a certain sombre charm in which were blended perhaps extracts of the flavour of \u2018preserves,\u2019 the smell of the fire of logs and of the pages of one of Bergotte\u2019s books, the colour of the stony front of the house opposite, all of which things still to-day when they rise like a gaseous bubble from the depths of my memory preserve their own specific virtue through all the successive layers of rival interests which must be traversed before they reach the surface\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These were \u2014 commanding the distant sea from the crests of their several dunes or folding themselves already for the night beneath hills of a crude green colour and uncomfortable shape, like that of the sofa in one\u2019s bedroom in an hotel at which one has just arrived, each composed of a cluster of villas whose line was extended to include a lawn-tennis court and now and then a casino, over which a flag would be snapping in the freshening breeze, like a hollow cough \u2014 a series of watering-places which now let me see for the first time their regular visitors, but let me see only the external features of those visitors \u2014 lawn-tennis players in white hats, the station-master spending all his life there on the spot among his tamarisks and roses, a lady in a straw \u2018boater\u2019 who, following the everyday routine of an existence which I should never know, was calling to her dog which had stopped to examine something in the road before going in to her bungalow where the lamp was already lighted for her return \u2014 which with these strangely usual and slightingly familiar sights stung my un-greeted eyes and stabbed my exiled heart. But how much were my sufferings increased when we had finally landed in the hall of the Grand Hotel at Balbec, and I stood there in front of the monumental staircase that looked like marble, while my grandmother, regardless of the growing hostility of the strangers among whom we should have to live, discussed \u2018terms\u2019 with the manager, a sort of nodding mandarin whose face and voice were alike covered with scars (left by the excision of countless pustules from one and from the other of the divers accents acquired from an alien ancestry and in a cosmopolitan upbringing) who stood there in a smart dinner-jacket, with the air of an expert psychologist, classifying, whenever the \u2018omnibus\u2019 discharged a fresh load, the \u2018nobility and gentry\u2019 as \u2018geesers\u2019 and the \u2018hotel crooks\u2019 as nobility and gentry. Forgetting, probably, that he himself was not drawing five hundred francs a month, he had a profound contempt for people to whom five hundred francs \u2014 or, as he preferred ta put it,\u2018twenty-five louis\u2019 was \u2018a lot of money,\u2019 and regarded them as belonging to a race of pariahs for whom the Grand Hotel was certainly not intended. It is true that even within its walls there were people who did not pay very much and yet had not forfeited the manager\u2019s esteem, provided that he was assured that they were watching their expenditure not from poverty so much as from avarice. For this could in no way lower their standing since it is a vice and may consequently be found at every grade of social position. Social position was the one thing by which the manager was impressed, social position, or rather the signs which seemed to him to imply that it was exalted, such as not taking one\u2019s hat off when one came into the hall, wearing knickerbockers, or an overcoat with a waist, and taking a cigar with a band of purple and gold out of a crushed morocco case \u2014 to none of which advantages could I, alas, lay claim. He would also adorn his business conversation with choice expressions, to which, as a rule, he gave a wrong meaning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I heard my grandmother, who shewed no sign of annoyance at his listening to her with his hat on his head and whistling through his teeth at her, ask him in an artificial voice, \u201cAnd what are . . . your charges? . . . Oh! far too high for my little budget,\u201d waiting upon a bench, I sought refuge in the innermost depths of my own consciousness, strove to migrate to a plane of eternal thoughts \u2014 to leave nothing of myself, nothing that lived and felt on the surface of my body, anaesthetised as are those of animals which by inhibition feign death when they are attacked \u2014 so as not to suffer too keenly in this place, with which my total unfamiliarity was made all the more evident to me when I saw the familiarity that seemed at the same moment to be enjoyed by a smartly dressed lady for whom the manager shewed his respect by taking liberties with the little dog that followed her across the hall, the young \u2018blood\u2019 with a feather in his hat who asked, as he came in, \u2018Any letters?\u2019\u2014 all these people to whom it was an act of home-coming to mount those stairs of imitation marble. And at the same time the triple frown of Minos, ^Eacus and Rhadamanthus (beneath which I plunged my naked soul as into an unknown element where there was nothing now to protect it) was bent sternly upon me by a group of gentlemen who, though little versed perhaps in the art of receiving, yet bore the title \u2018Reception Clerks,\u2019 while beyond them again, through a closed wall of glass, were people sitting in a reading-room for the description of which I should have had to borrow from Dante alternately the colours in which he paints Paradise and Hell, according as I was thinking of the happiness of the elect who had the right to sit and read there undisturbed, or of the terror which my grandmother would have inspired in me if, in her insensibility to this sort of impression, she had asked me to go in there and wait for her by myself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My sense of loneliness was further increased a moment later: when I had confessed to my grandmother that I did not feel well, that I thought that we should be obliged to return to Paris, she had offered no protest, saying merely that she was going out to buy a few things which would be equally useful whether we left or stayed (and which, I afterwards learned, were all for my benefit, Fran\u00e7oise having gone off with certain articles which I might need); while I waited for her I had taken a turn through the streets, packed with a crowd of people who imparted to them a sort of indoor warmth, streets in which were still open the hairdresser\u2019s shop and the pastry-cook\u2019s, the latter filled with customers eating ices, opposite the statue of Duguay-Trouin. This crowd gave me just about as much pleasure as a photograph of it in one of the \u2018illustrateds\u2019 might give a patient who was turning its pages in the surgeon\u2019s waiting-room. I was astonished to find that there were people so different from myself that this stroll through the town had actually been recommended to me by the manager as a distraction, and also that the torture chamber which a new place of residence is could appear to some people a \u2018continuous amusement,\u2019 to quote the hotel prospectus, which might, it was true, exaggerate, but was, for all that, addressed to a whole army of clients to whose tastes it must appeal. True, it invoked, to make them come to the Grand Hotel, Balbec, not only the \u2018exquisite fare\u2019 and the \u2018fairy-like view across the Casino gardens,\u2019 but also the \u2018ordinances of her Majesty Queen Fashion, which no one may break with impunity, or without being taken for a Boeotian, a charge that no well-bred man would willingly incur.\u2019 The need that I now had of my grandmother was enhanced by my fear that I had shattered another of her illusions. She must be feeling discouraged, feeling that if I could not stand the fatigue of this journey there was no hope that any change of air could ever do me good. I decided to return to the hotel and to wait for her there: the manager himself came forward and pressed a button, and a person whose acquaintance I had not yet made, labelled \u2018LIFT\u2019 (who at that highest point in the building, which corresponded to the lantern in a Norman church, was installed like a photographer in his darkroom or an organist in his loft) came rushing down towards me with the agility of a squirrel, tamed, active, caged. Then, sliding upwards again along a steel pillar, he bore me aloft in his train towards the dome of this temple of Mammon. On each floor, on either side of a narrow communicating stair, opened out fanwise a range of shadowy galleries, along one of which, carrying a bolster, a chambermaid came past. I lent to her face, which the gathering dusk made featureless, the mask of my most impassioned dreams of beauty, but read in her eyes as they turned towards me the horror of my own nonentity. Meanwhile, to dissipate, in the course of this interminable assent, the mortal anguish which I felt in penetrating thus in silence the mystery of this chiaroscuro so devoid of poetry, lighted by a single vertical line of little windows which were those of the solitary water-closet on each landing, I addressed a few words to the young organist, artificer of my journey and my partner in captivity, who continued to manipulate the registers of his instrument and to finger the stops. I apologised for taking up so much room, for giving him so much trouble, and asked whether I was not obstructing him in the practice of an art to which, so as to flatter the performer, I did more than display curiosity, I confessed my strong attachment. But he vouchsafed no answer, whether from astonishment at my words, preoccupation with what he was doing, regard for convention, hardness of hearing, respect for holy ground, fear of danger, slowness of understanding, or by the manager\u2019s orders\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is perhaps nothing that gives us so strong an impression of the reality of the external world as the difference in the positions, relative to ourselves, of even a quite unimportant person before we have met him and after. I was the same man who had taken, that afternoon, the little train from Balbec to the coast, I carried in my body the same consciousness But on that consciousness, in the place where, at six o\u2019clock, there had been, with the impossibility of forming any idea of the manager, the Grand Hotel or its occupants, a vague and timorous impatience for the moment at which I should reach my destination, were to be found now the pustules excised from the face of the cosmopolitan manager (he was, as a matter of fact, a naturalised Mon\u00e9gasque, although \u2014 as he himself put it, for he was always using expressions which he thought distinguished without noticing that they were incorrect \u2014\u2018of Rumanian originality\u2019), his action in ringing for the lift, the lift-boy himself, a whole frieze of puppet-show characters issuing from that Pandora\u2019s box which was the Grand Hotel, undeniable, irremovable, and, like everything that is realised, sterilising. But at least this change, which I had done nothing to bring about, proved to me that something had happened which was external to myself \u2014 however devoid of interest that thing might be \u2014 and I was like a traveller who, having had the sun in his face when he started, concludes that he has been for so many hours on the road when he finds the sun behind him. I was half dead with exhaustion, I was burning with fever; I would gladly have gone to bed, but I had no night-things. I should have liked at least to lie down for a little while on the bed, but what good would that have done me, seeing that I should not have been able to find any rest there for that mass of sensations which is for each of us his sentient if not his material body, and that the unfamiliar objects which encircled that body, forcing it to set its perceptions on the permanent footing of a vigilant and defensive guard, would have kept my sight, my hearing, all my senses in a position as cramped and comfortless (even if I had stretched out my legs) as that of Cardinal La Balue in the cage in which he could neither stand nor sit. It is our noticing them that puts things in a room, our growing used to them that takes them away again and clears a space for us. Space there was none for me in my bedroom (mine in name only) at Balbec; it was full of things which did not know me, which flung back at me the distrustful look that I had cast at them, and, without taking any heed of my existence, shewed that I was interrupting the course of theirs. The clock \u2014 whereas at home I heard my clock tick only a few seconds in a week, when I was coming out of some profound meditation \u2014 continued without a moment\u2019s interruption to utter, in an unknown tongue, a series of observations which must have been most uncomplimentary to myself, for the violet curtains listened to them without replying, but in an attitude such as people adopt who shrug their shoulders to indicate that the sight of a third person irritates them. They gave to this room with its lofty ceiling a semi-historical character which might have made it a suitable place for the assassination of the Duc de Guise, and afterwards for parties of tourists personally conducted by one of Messrs. Thomas Cook and Son\u2019s guides, but for me to sleep in \u2014 no. I was tormented by the presence of some little bookcases with glass fronts which ran along the walls, but especially by a large mirror with feet which stood across one corner, for I felt that until it had left the room there would be no possibility of rest for me there. I kept raising my eyes \u2014 which the things in my room in Paris disturbed no more than did my eyelids themselves, for they were merely extensions of my organs, an enlargement of myself \u2014 towards the fantastically high ceiling of this belvedere planted upon the summit of the hotel which my grandmother had chosen for me; and in that region more intimate than those in which we see and hear, that region in which we test the quality of odours, almost in the very heart of my inmost self, the smell of flowering grasses next launched its offensive against my last feeble line of trenches, where I stood up to it, not without tiring myself still further, with the futile incessant defence of an anxious sniffing. Having no world, no room, no body now that was not menaced by the enemies thronging round me, invaded to the very bones by fever, I was utterly alone; I longed to die. Then my grandmother came in, and to the expansion of my ebbing heart there opened at once an infinity of space\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was wearing a loose cambric gown which she put on at home whenever any of us was ill (because she felt more comfortable in it, she used to say, for she always ascribed to her actions a selfish motive), and which was, for tending us, for watching by our beds, her servant\u2019s livery, her nurse\u2019s uniform, her religious habit. But whereas the trouble that servants, nurses, religious take, their kindness to us, the merits that we discover in them and the gratitude that we owe them all go to increase the impression that we have of being, in their eyes, some one different, of feeling that we are alone, keeping in our own hands the control over our thoughts, our will to live, I knew, when I was with my grandmother, that, however great the misery that there was in me, it would be received by her with a pity still more vast; that everything that was mine, my cares, my wishes, would be, in my grandmother, supported upon a desire to save and prolong my life stronger than was my own; and my thoughts were continued in her without having to undergo any deflection, since they passed from my mind into hers without change of atmosphere or of personality. And \u2014 like a man who tries to fasten his necktie in front of a glass and forgets that the end which he sees reflected is not on the side to which he raises his hand, or like a dog that chases along the ground the dancing shadow of an insect in the air \u2014 misled by her appearance in the body as we are apt to be in this world where we have no direct perception of people\u2019s souls, I threw myself into the arms of my grandmother and clung with my lips to her face as though I had access thus to that immense heart which she opened to me. And when I felt my mouth glued to her cheeks, to her brow, I drew from them something so beneficial, so nourishing that I lay in her arms as motionless, as solemn, as calmly gluttonous as a babe at the breast\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At last I let go, and lay and gazed, and could not tire of gazing at her large face, as clear in its outline as a fine cloud, glowing and serene, behind which I could discern the radiance of her tender love. And everything that received, in however slight a degree, any share of her sensations, everything that could be said to belong in any way to her was at once so spiritualised, so sanctified, that with outstretched hands I smoothed her dear hair, still hardly grey, with as much respect, precaution, comfort as if I had actually been touching her goodness. She found a similar pleasure in taking any trouble that saved me one, and in a moment of immobility and rest for my weary limbs something so delicious that when, having seen that she wished to help me with my undressing and to take my boots off, I made as though to stop her and began to undress myself, with an imploring gaze she arrested my hands as they fumbled with the top buttons of my coat and boots\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, do let me!\u201d she begged. \u201cIt is such a joy for your Granny. And be sure you knock on the wall if you want anything in the night. My bed is just on the other side, and the partition is, quite thin. Just give a knock now, as soon as you are ready, so that we shall know where we are.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, sure enough, that evening I gave three knocks \u2014 a signal which, the week after, when I was ill, I repeated every morning for several days, because my grandmother wanted me to have some milk early. Then, when I thought that I could hear her stirring, so that she should not be kept waiting but might, the moment she had brought me the milk, go to sleep again, I ventured on three little taps, timidly, faintly, but for all that distinctly, for if I was afraid of disturbing her, supposing that I had been mistaken and that she was still asleep, I should not have wished her either to lie awake listening for a summons which she had not at once caught and which I should not have the courage to repeat. And scarcely had I given my taps than I heard three others, in a different intonation from mine, stamped with a calm authority, repeated twice over so that there should be no mistake, and saying to me plainly: \u201cDon\u2019t get excited; I heard you; I shall be with you in a minute!\u201d and shortly afterwards my grandmother appeared. I explained to her that I had been afraid that she would not hear me, or might think that it was some one in the room beyond who was lapping; at which she smiled:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMistake my poor chick\u2019s knocking for anyone else! Why, Granny could tell it among a thousand! Do you suppose there\u2019s anyone else in the world who\u2019s such a silly-billy, with such feverish little knuckles, so afraid of waking me up and of not making me understand? Even if he just gave the least scratch, Granny could tell her mouse\u2019s sound at once, especially such a poor miserable little mouse as mine is. I could hear it just now, trying to make up its mind, and rustling the bedclothes, and going through all its tricks.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She pushed open the shutters; where a wing of the hotel jutted out at right angles to my window, the sun was already installed upon the roof, like a slater who is up betimes, and starts early and works quietly so as not to rouse the sleeping town, whose stillness seems to enhance his activity. She told me what o\u2019clock, what sort of day it was; that it was not worth while my getting up and coming to the window, that there was a mist over the sea; if the baker\u2019s shop had opened yet; what the vehicle was that I could hear passing. All that brief, trivial curtain-raiser, that negligible introit of a new day, performed without any spectator, a little scrap of life which was only for our two selves, which I should have no hesitation in repeating, later on, to Fran\u00e7oise or even to strangers, speaking of the fog \u2018which you could have cut with a knife at six o\u2019clock that morning, with the ostentation of one who was boasting not of a piece of knowledge that he had acquired but of a mark of affection shewn to himself alone; dear morning moment, opened like a symphony by the rhythmical dialogue of my three taps, to which the thin wall of my bedroom, steeped in love and joy, grown melodious, immaterial, singing like the angelic choir, responded with three other taps, eagerly awaited, repeated once and again, in which it contrived to waft to me the soul of my grandmother, whole and perfect, and the promise of her coming, with a swiftness of annunciation and melodic accuracy. But on this first night after our arrival, when my grandmqther had left me, I began again to feel as I had felt, the day before, in Paris, at the moment of leaving home. Perhaps this fear that I had \u2014 and shared with so many of my fellow-men \u2014 of sleeping in a strange room, perhaps this fear is only the most humble, obscure, organic, almost unconscious form of that great and desperate resistance set up by the things that constitute the better part of our present life towards our mentally assuming, by accepting it as true, the formula of a future in which those things are to have no part; a resistance which was at the root of the horror that I had so often been made to feel by the thought that my parents must, one day, die, that the stern necessity of life might qblige me to live remote from Gilberte, or simply to settle permanently in a place where I should never see any of my old friends; a resistance which was also at the root of the difficulty that I found in imagining my own death, or a survival such as Bergotte used to promise to mankind in his books, a survival in which I should not be allowed to take with me my memories, my frailties, my character, which did not easily resign themselves to the idea of ceasing to be, and desired for me neither annihilation nor an eternity in which they would have no part\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Swann had said to me, in Paris one day when I felt particularly unwell: \u201cYou ought to go off to one of those glorious islands in the Pacific; you\u2019d never come back again if you did.\u201d I should have liked to answer: \u201cBut then I shall not see your daughter any more; I shall be living among people and things she has never seen.\u201d And yet my better judgment whispered: \u201cWhat difference can that make, since you are not going to be affected by it? When M. Swann tells you that you will not come back he means by that that you will not want to come back, and if you don\u2019t want to that is because you will be happier out there.\u201d For my judgment was aware that Habit \u2014 Habit which was even now setting to work to make me like this unfamiliar lodging, to change the position of the mirror, the shade of the curtains, to stop the clock \u2014 undertakes as well to make dear to us the companions whom at first we disliked, to give another appearance to their faces, to make attractive the sound of their voices, to modify the inclinations of their hearts. It is true that these new friendships for places and people are based upon forgetfulness of the old; but what my better judgment was thinking was simply that I could look without apprehension along the vista of a life in which I should be for ever separated from people all memory of whom I should lose, and it was by way of consolation that my mind was offering to my heart a promise of oblivion which succeeded only in sharpening the edge of its despair. Not that the heart also is not bound in time, when separation is complete, to feel the anodyne effect of habit; but until then it will continue to suffer. And our dread of a future in which we must forego the sight of faces, the sound of voices that we love, friends from whom we derive to-day our keenest joys, this dread, far from being dissipated, is intensified, if to the grief of such a privation we reflect that there will be added what seems to us now in anticipation an even more cruel grief; not to feel it as a grief at all \u2014 to remain indifferent; for if that should occur, our ego would have changed, it would then be not merely the attractiveness of our family, pur mistress, our friends that had ceased to environ us, but our affection for them; it would have been so completely eradicated from our heart, in which to-day it is a conspicuous element, that we should be able to enjoy that life apart from them the very thought of which to-day makes us recoil in horror; so that it would be in a real sense the death of ourselves, a death followed, it is true, by resurrection but in a different ego, the life, the love of which are beyond the reach of those elements of the existing ego that are doomed to die. It is they \u2014 even the meanest of them, such as our obscure attachments to the dimensions, to the atmosphere of a bedroom \u2014 that grow stubborn and refuse, in acts of rebellion which we must recognise to be a secret, partial, tangible and true aspect of our resistance to death, of the long resistance, desperate and daily renewed, to a fragmentary and gradual death such as interpolates itself throughout the whole course of our life, tearing away from us at every moment a shred of ourselves, dead matter on which new cells will multiply, and grow. And for a neurotic nature such as mine, one that is to say in which the intermediaries, the nerves, perform their functions badly \u2014 fail to arrest on its way to the consciousness, allow indeed to penetrate there, distinct, exhausting, innumerable, agonising, the plaint of those most humble elements of the personality which are about to disappear \u2014 the anxiety and alarm which I felt as I lay outstretched beneath that strange and too lofty ceiling were but the protest of an affection that survived in me for a ceiling that was familiar and low. Doubtless this affection too would disappear, and another have taken its place (when death, and then another life, would, in the guise of Habit, have performed their double task); but until its annihilation, every night it would suffer afresh, and on this first night especially, confronted with a future already realised in which there would no longer be any place for it, it rose in revolt, it tortured me with the sharp sound of its lamentations whenever my straining eyes, powerless to turn from what was wounding them, endeavoured to fasten their gaze upon that inaccessible ceiling\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But next morning! \u2014 after a servant had come to call me, and had brought me hot water, and while I was washing and dressing myself and trying in vain to find the things that I wanted in my trunk, from which I extracted, pell-mell, only a lot of things that were of no use whatever, what a joy it was to me, thinking already of the delights of luncheon and of a walk along the shore, to see in the window, and in all the glass fronts of the bookcases as in the portholes of a ship\u2019s cabin, the open sea, naked, unshadowed, and yet with half of its expanse in shadow, bounded by a thin and fluctuant line, and to follow with my eyes the waves that came leaping towards me, one behind another, like divers along a springboard. Every other moment, holding in one hand the starched, unyielding towel, with the name of the hotel printed upon it, with which I was making futile efforts to dry myself, I returned to the window to gaze once more upon that vast amphitheatre, dazzling, mountainous, and upon the snowy crests of its emerald waves, here and there polished and translucent, which with a placid violence, a leonine bending of the brows, let their steep fronts, to which the sun now added a smile without face or features, run forward to their goal, totter and melt and be no more. Window in which I was, henceforward, to plant myself every morning, as at the pane of a mail coach in which one has slept, to see whether, in the night, a long sought mountain-chain has come nearer or withdrawn \u2014 only here it was those hills of the sea which, before they come dancing back towards us, are apt to retire so far that often it was only at the end of a long and sandy plain that I would distinguish, miles it seemed away, their first undulations upon a background transparent, vaporous, bluish, like the glaciers that one sees in the backgrounds of the Tuscan Primitives. On other mornings it was quite close at hand that the sun was smiling upon those waters of a green as tender as that preserved in Alpine pastures (among mountains on which the sun spreads himself here and there like a lazy giant who may at any moment come leaping gaily down their craggy sides) less by the moisture of their soil than by the liquid mobility of their light. Anyhow, in that breach which shore and water between them drive through all the rest of the world, for the passage, the accumulation there of light, it is light above all, according to the direction from which it comes and along which our eyes follow it, it is light that shifts and fixes the undulations of the sea. Difference of lighting modifies no less the orientation of a place, constructs no less before our eyes new goals which it inspires in us the yearning to attain, than would a distance in space actually traversed in the course of a long journey. When, in the morning, the sun came from behind the hotel, disclosing to me the sands bathed in light as far as the first bastions of the sea, it seemed to be shewing me another side of the picture, and to be engaging me in the pursuit, along the winding path of its rays, of a journey motionless but ever varied amid all the fairest scenes of the diversified landscape of the hours. And on this first morning the sun pointed out to me far off with a jovial finger those blue peaks of the sea, which bear no name upon any geographer\u2019s chart, until, dizzy with its sublime excursion over the thundering and chaotic surface of their crests and avalanches, it came back to take shelter from the wind in my bedroom, swaggering across the unmade bed and scattering its riches over the splashed surface of the basin-stand, and into my open trunk, where by its very splendour and ill-matched luxury it added still further to the general effect of disorder. Alas, that wind from the sea; an hour later, in the great dining-room \u2014 while we were having our luncheon, and from the leathern gourd of a lemon were sprinkling a few golden drops on to a pair of soles which presently left on our plates the plumes of their picked skeletons, curled like stiff feathers and resonant as citherns \u2014 it seemed to my grandmother a cruel deprivation not to be able to feel its life-giving breath on her cheek, on account of the window, transparent but closed, which like the front of a glass case in a museum divided us from the beach while allowing us to look out upon its whole extent, and into which the sky entered so completely that its azure had the effect of being the colour of the windows and its white clouds only so many flaws in the glass. Imagining that I was \u2018seated upon the mole\u2019 or at rest in the \u2018boudoir\u2019 of which Baudelaire speaks I asked myself whether his \u2018Sun\u2019s rays upon the sea\u2019 were not \u2014 a very different thing from the evening ray, simple and superficial as the wavering stroke of a golden pencil \u2014 just what at that moment was scorching the sea topaz-brown, fermenting it, turning it pale and milky like foaming beer, like milk, while now and then there hovered over it great blue shadows which some god seemed, for his pastime, to be shifting to and fro by moving a mirror in the sky. Unfortunately, it was not only in its outlook that it differed from our room at Combray, giving upon the houses over the way, this dining-room at Balbec, bare-walled, filled with a sunlight green as the water in a marble font, while a few feet away the full tide and broad daylight erected as though before the gates of the heavenly city an indestructible and moving rampart of emerald and gold. At Combray, since we were known to everyone, I took heed of no one. In life at the seaside one knows only one\u2019s own party. I was not yet old enough, I was still too sensitive to have outgrown the desire to find favour in the sight of other people and to possess their hearts. Nor had I acquired the more noble indifference which a man of the world would have felt, with regard to the people who were eating their luncheon in the room, nor to the boys and girls who strolled past the window, with whom I was pained by the thought that I should never be allowed to go on expeditions, though not so much pained as if my grandmother, contemptuous of social formalities and concerned about nothing but my health, had gone to them with the request, humiliating for me to overhear, that they would consent to let me accompany them. Whether they were returning to some villa beyond my ken, or had emerged from it, racquet in hand, on their way to some lawn-tennis court, or were mounted on horses whose hooves trampled and tore my heart, I gazed at them with a passionate curiosity, in that blinding light of the beach by which social distinctions are altered, I followed all their movements through the transparency of that great bay of glass which allowed so much light to flood the room. But it intercepted the wind, and this seemed wrong to my grandmother, who, unable to endure the thought that I was losing the benefit of an hour in the open air, surreptitiously unlatched a pane and at once set flying, with the bills of fare, the newspapers, veils and hats of all the people at the other tables; she herself, fortified by the breath of heaven, remained calm and smiling like Saint Blandina, amid the torrent of invective which, increasing my sense of isolation and misery, those scornful, dishevelled, furious visitors combined to pour on us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To a certain extent \u2014 and this, at Balbec, gave to the population, as a rule monotonously rich and cosmopolitan, of that sort of smart and \u2018exclusive\u2019 hotel, a quite distinctive local character \u2014 they were composed of eminent persons from the departmental capitals of that region of France, a chief magistrate from Caen, a leader of the Cherbourg bar, a big solicitor from Le Mans, who annually, when the holidays came round, starting from the various points over which, throughout the working year, they were scattered like snipers in a battle or draughtsmen upon a board, concentrated their forces upon this hotel. They always reserved the same rooms, and with their wives, who had pretensions to aristocracy, formed a little group, which was joined by a leading barrister and a leading doctor from Paris, who on the day of their departure would say to the others:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, yes, of course; you don\u2019t go by our train. You are fortunate, you will be home in time for luncheon.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cFortunate, do you say? You, who live in the Capital, in \u2018Paris, the great town,\u2019 while I have to live in a wretched county town of a hundred thousand souls (it is true, we managed to muster a hundred and two thousand at the last census, but what is that compared to your two and a half millions?) going back, too, to asphalt streets and all the bustle and gaiety of Paris life?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They said this with a rustic burring of their r\u2019s, but without bitterness, for they were leading lights each in his own province, who could like other people have gone to Paris had they chosen \u2014 the chief magistrate of Caen had several times been offered a judgeship in the Court of Appeal \u2014 but had preferred to stay where they were, from love of their native towns or of obscurity or of fame, or because they were reactionaries, and enjoyed being on friendly terms with the country houses of the neighbourhood. Besides several of them were not going back at once to their county towns\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For \u2014 inasmuch as the Bay of Balbec was a little world apart in the midst of a great world, a basketful of the seasons in which were clustered in a ring good days and bad, and the months in their order, so that not only, on days when one could make out Rivebelle, which was in itself a sign of coming storms, could one see the sunlight on the houses there while Balbec was plunged in darkness, but later on, when the cold weather had reached Balbec, one could be certain of finding on that opposite shore two or three supplementary months of warmth \u2014 those of the regular visitors to the Grand Hotel whose holidays began late or lasted long, gave orders, when rain and fog came and Autumn was in the air, for their boxes to be packed and embarked, and set sail across the Bay to find summer again at Rivebelle or Costedor. This little group in the Balbec hotel looked with distrust upon each new arrival, and while affecting to take not the least interest in him, hastened, all of them, to ply with questions their friend the head waiter. For it was the same head waiter \u2014 Aim\u00e9\u2014 who returned every year for the season, and kept their tables for them; and their good ladies, having heard that his wife was \u2018expecting,\u2019 would sit after meals working each at one of the \u2018little things,\u2019 stopping only to put up their glasses and stare at us, my grandmother and myself, because we were eating hard-boiled eggs in salad, which was considered common, and was, in fact, \u2018not done\u2019 in the best society of Alen\u00e7on. They affected an attitude of contemptuous irony with regard to a Frenchman who was called \u2018His Majesty\u2019 and had indeed proclaimed himself King of a small island in the South Seas, inhabited by a few savages. He was staying in the hotel with his pretty mistress, whom, as she crossed the beach to bathe, the little boys would greet with \u201cThree cheers for the Queen!\u201d because she would reward them with a shower of small silver. The chief magistrate and the barrister went so far as to pretend not to see her, and if any of their friends happened to look at her, felt bound to warn him that she was only a little shop-girl\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I was told that at Ostend they used the royal bathing machine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, and why not? It\u2019s on hire for twenty francs. You can take it yourself, if you care for that sort of thing. Anyhow, I know for a fact that the fellow asked for an audience, when he was there, with the King, who sent back word that he took no cognisance of any Pantomime Princes.\u201d \u201cReally, that\u2019s interesting! What queer people there are in the world, to be sure!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And I dare say it was all quite true: but it was also from resentment of the thought that, to many of their fellow-visitors, they were themselves simply respectable but rather common people who did not know this King and Queen so prodigal with their small change, that the solicitor, the magistrate, the barrister, when what they were pleased to call the \u2018Carnival\u2019 went by, felt so much annoyance, and expressed aloud an indignation that was quite understood by their friend the head waiter who, obliged to shew proper civility to these generous if not authentic Sovereigns, still, while he took their orders, would dart from afar at his old patrons a covert but speaking glance. Perhaps there was also something of the same resentment at being erroneously supposed to be less and unable to explain that they were more smart, underlining the \u2018fine specimen\u2019 with which they qualified a young \u2018blood,\u2019 the consumptive and dissipated son of an industrial magnate, who appeared every day in a new suit of clothes with an orchid in his buttonhole, drank champagne at luncheon, and then strolled out of the hotel, pale, impassive, a smile of complete indifference on his lips, to the casino to throw away at the baccarat table enormous sums, \u2018which he could ill afford to lose,\u2019 as the solicitor said with a resigned air to the chief magistrate, whose wife had it \u2018on good authority\u2019 that this \u2018detrimental\u2019 young man was bringing his parents\u2019 grey hair in sorrow to the grave\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, the barrister and his friends could not exhaust their flow of sarcasm on the subject of a wealthy old lady of title, because she never moved anywhere without taking her whole household with her. Whenever the wives of the solicitor and the magistrate saw her in the dining-room at meal-times they put up their glasses and gave her an insolent scrutiny, as minute and distrustful as if she had been some dish with a pretentious name but a suspicious appearance which, after the negative result of a systematic study, must be sent away with a lofty wave of the hand and a grimace of disgust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt by this behaviour they meant only to shew that, if there were things in the world which they themselves lacked \u2014 in this instance, certain prerogatives which the old lady enjoyed, and the privilege of her acquaintance \u2014 it was not because they could not, but because they did not choose to acquire them. But they had succeeded in convincing themselves that this really was what they felt; and it was the suppression of all desire for, of all curiosity as to forms of life which were unfamiliar, of all hope of pleasing new people (for which, in the women, had been substituted a feigned contempt, an artificial brightness) that had the awkward result of obliging them to label their discontent satisfaction, and lie everlastingly to themselves, for which they were greatly to be pitied. But everyone else in the hotel was no doubt behaving in a similar fashion, though his behaviour might take a different form, and sacrificing, if not to self-importance, at any rate to certain inculcated principles and mental habits the thrilling delight of mixing in a strange kind of life. Of course, the atmosphere of the microcosm in which the old lady isolated herself was not poisoned with virulent bitterness, as was that of the group in which the wives of the solicitor and magistrate sat chattering with impotent rage. It was indeed embalmed with a delicate and old-world fragrance which, however, was none the less artificial. For at heart the old lady would probably have found in attracting, in attaching to herself (and, with that object, recreating herself), the mysterious sympathy of new friends a charm which is altogether lacking from the pleasure that is to be derived from mixing only with the people of one\u2019s own world, and reminding oneself that, one\u2019s own being the best of all possible worlds, the ill-informed contempt of \u2018outsiders\u2019 may be disregarded. Perhaps she felt that \u2014 were she to arriveincognito at the Grand Hotel, Balbec, she would, in her black stuff gown and old-fashioned bonnet, bring a smile to the lips of some old reprobate, who from the depths of his rocking chair would glance up and murmur, \u201cWhat a scarecrow!\u201d or, still worse, to those of some man of repute who bad, like the magistrate, kept between his pepper-and-salt whiskers a rosy complexion and a pair of sparkling eyes such as she liked to see, and would at once bring the magnifying lens of the conjugal glasses to bear upon so quaint a phenomenon; and perhaps it was in unconfessed dread of those first few minutes, which, though one knows that they will be but a few minutes, are none the less terrifying, like the first plunge of one\u2019s head under water, that this old lady sent down in advance a servant, who would inform the hotel of the personality and habits of his mistress, and, cutting short the manager\u2019s greetings, made, with an abruptness in which there was more timidity than pride, for her room, where her own curtains, substituted for those that draped the hotel windows, her own screens and photographs, set up so effectively between her and the outside world, to which otherwise she would have had to adapt herself, the barrier of her private life that it was her home (in which she had comfortably stayed) that travelled rather than herself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thenceforward, having placed between herself, on the one hand, and the staff of the hotel and its decorators on the other the servants who bore instead of her the shock of contact with all this strange humanity, and kept up around their mistress her familiar atmosphere, having set her prejudices between herself and the other visitors, indifferent whether or not she gave offence to people whom her friends would not have had in their houses, it was in her own world that she continued to live, by correspondence with her friends, by memories, by her intimate sense of and confidence in her own position, the quality of her manners, the competence of her politeness. And every day, when she came downstairs to go for a drive in her own carriage, the lady\u2019s-maid who came after her carrying her wraps, the footman who preceded her, seemed like sentries who, at the gate of an embassy, flying the flag of the country to which she belonged, assured to her upon foreign soil the privilege of extra-territoriality. She did not leave her room until late in the afternoon on the day following our arrival, so that we did not see her in the dining-room, into which the manager, since we were strangers there, conducted us, taking us under his wing, as a corporal takes a squad of recruits to the master-tailor, to have them fitted; we did see however, a moment later, a country gentleman and his daughter, of an obscure but very ancient Breton family, M. and Mlle, de Stermaria, whose table had been allotted to us, in the belief that they had gone out and would not be back until the evening. Having come to Balbec only to see various country magnates whom they knew in that neighbourhood, they spent in the hotel dining-room, what with the invitations they accepted and the visits they paid, only such time as was strictly unavoidable. It was their stiffness that preserved them intact from all human sympathy, from interesting at all the strangers seated round about them, among whom M. de Stermaria kept up the glacial, preoccupied, distant, rude, punctilious and distrustful air that we assume in a railway refreshment-room, among fellow-passengers whom we have never seen before and will never see again, and with whom we can conceive of no other relations than to defend from their onslaught our \u2018portion\u2019 of cold chicken and our corner seat in the train. No sooner had we begun our luncheon than we were asked to leave the table, on the instructions of M. de Stermaria who had just arrived and, without the faintest attempt at an apology to us, requested the head waiter, in our hearing, to \u201csee that such a mistake did not occur again,\u201d for it was repugnant to him that \u201cpeople whom he did not know\u201d should have taken his table\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And certainly into the feeling which impelled a young actress (better known, though, for her smart clothes, her smart sayings, her collection of German porcelain, than in the occasional parts that she had played at the Od\u00e9on), her lover, an immensely rich young man for whose sake she had acquired her culture, and two sprigs of aristocracy at that time much in the public eye to form a little band apart, to travel only together, to come down to luncheon \u2014 when at Balbec \u2014 very late, after everyone had finished; to spend the whole day in their sitting-room playing cards, there entered no sort of ill-humour against the rest of us but simply the requirements of the taste that they had formed for a certain type of conversation, for certain refinements of good living, which made them find pleasure in spending their time, in taking their meals only by themselves, and would have rendered intolerable a life in common with people who had not been initiated into those mysteries. Even at a dinner or a card table, each of them had to be certain that, in the diner or partner who sat opposite to him, there was, latent and not yet made use of, a certain brand of knowledge which would enable him to identify the rubbish with which so many houses in Paris were littered as genuine mediaeval or renaissance \u2018pieces\u2019 and, whatever the subject of discussion, to apply the critical standards common to all their party whereby they distinguished good work from bad. Probably it was only \u2014 at such moments \u2014 by some infrequent, amusing interruption flung into the general silence of meal or game, or by the new and charming frock which the young actress had put on for luncheon or for poker, that the special kind of existence in which these four friends desired, above all things, to remain plunged was made apparent. But by engulfing them thus in a system of habits which they knew by heart it sufficed to protect them from the mystery of the life that was going on all round them. All the long afternoon, the sea was suspended there before their eyes only as a canvas of attractive colouring might hang on the wall of a wealthy bachelor\u2019s flat and it was only in the intervals between the \u2018hands\u2019 that one of the players, finding nothing better to do, raised his eyes to it to seek from it some indication of the weather or the time, and to remind the others that tea was ready. And at night they did not dine in the hotel, where, hidden springs of electricity flooding the great dining-room with light, it became as it were an immense and wonderful aquarium against whose wall of glass the working population of Balbec, the fishermen and also the tradesmen\u2019s families, clustering invisibly in the outer darkness, pressed their faces to watch, gently floating upon the golden eddies within, the luxurious life of its occupants, a thing as extraordinary to the poor as the life of strange fishes or molluscs (an important social question, this: whether the wall of glass will always protect the wonderful creatures at their feasting, whether the obscure folk who watch them hungrily out of the night will not break in some day to gather them from their aquarium and devour them). Meanwhile there may have been, perhaps, among the gazing crowd, a motionless, formless mass there in the dark, some writer, some student of human ichthyology who, as he watched the jaws of old feminine monstrosities close over a mouthful of food which they proceeded then to absorb, was amusing himself by classifying them according to their race, by their innate characteristics as well as by those acquired characteristics which bring it about that an old Serbian lady whose buccal protuberance is that of a great sea-fish, because from her earliest years she has moved in the fresh waters of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, eats her salad for all the world like a La Rochefoucauld\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that hour one could see the three young men in dinner-jackets, waiting for the young woman, who was as usual late but presently, wearing a dress that was almost always different and one of a series of scarves, chosen to gratify some special instinct in her lover, after having from her landing rung for the lift, would emerge from it like a doll coming out of its box. And then all four, because they found that the international phenomenon of the \u2018Palace,\u2019 planted on Balbec soil, had blossomed there in material splendour rather than in food that was fit to eat, bundled into a carriage and went to dine, a mile off, in a little restaurant that was well spoken of, where they held with the cook himself endless discussions of the composition of their meal and the cooking of its various dishes. During their drive, the road bordered with apple-trees that led out of Balbec was no more to them than the distance that must be traversed \u2014 barely distinguishable in the darkness from that which separated their homes in Paris from the Caf\u00e9 Anglais or the Tour d\u2019Argent \u2014 before they could arrive at the fashionable little restaurant where, while the young man\u2019s friends envied him because he had such a smartly dressed mistress, the latter\u2019s scarves were spread about the little company like a fragrant, flowing veil, but one that kept it apart from the outer world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas for my peace of mind, I had none of the detachment that all these people shewed. To many of them I gave constant thought; I should have liked not to pass unobserved by a man with a receding brow and eyes that dodged between the blinkers of his prejudices and his education, the great nobleman of the district, who was none other than the brother-in-law of Legrandin, and came every now and then to see somebody at Balbec and on Sundays, by reason of the weekly garden-party that his wife and he gave, robbed the hotel of a large number of its occupants, because one or two of them were invited to these entertainments and the others, so as not to appear to have been not invited, chose that day for an expedition to some distant spot. He had had, as it happened, an exceedingly bad reception at the hotel on the first day of the season, when the staff, freshly imported from the Riviera, did not yet know who or what he was. Not only was he not wearing white flannels, but, with old-fashioned French courtesy and in his ignorance of the ways of smart hotels, on coming into the hall in which there were ladies sitting, he had taken off his hat at the door, the effect of which had been that the manager did not so much as raise a finger to his own in acknowledgment, concluding that this must be some one of the most humble extraction, what he called \u2018sprung from the ordinary.\u2019 The solicitor\u2019s wife, alone, had felt herself attracted by the stranger, who exhaled all the starched vulgarity of the really respectable, and had declared, with the unerring discernment and the indisputable authority of a person from whom the highest society of Le Mans held no secrets, that one could see at a glance that one was in the presence of a gentleman of great distinction, of perfect breeding, a striking contrast to the sort of people one usually saw at Balbec, whom she condemned as impossible to know so long as she did not know them. This favourable judgment which she had pronounced on Legrandin\u2019s brother-in-law was based perhaps on the spiritless appearance of a man about whom there was nothing to intimidate anyone; perhaps also she had recognised in this gentleman farmer with the gait of a sacristan the Masonic signs of her own inveterate clericalism\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It made no difference my knowing that the young fellows who went past the hotel every day on horseback were the sons of the questionably solvent proprietor of a linen-drapery to whom my father would never have dreamed of speaking; the glamour of \u2018seaside life\u2019 exalted them in my eyes to equestrian statues of demi-gods, and the best thing that I could hope for was that they would never allow their proud gaze to fall upon the wretched boy who was myself, who left the hotel dining-room only to sit humbly upon the sands. I should have been glad to arouse some response even from the adventurer who had been king of a desert island in the South Seas, even of the young consumptive, of whom I liked to think that he was hiding beneath his insolent exterior a shy and tender heart, which would perhaps have lavished on me, and on me alone, the treasures of its affection. Besides (unlike what one generally says of the people one meets when travelling) just as being seen in certain company can invest us, in a watering-place to which we shall return another year, with a coefficient that has no equivalent in our true social life, so there is nothing \u2014 not which we keep so resolutely at a distance, but \u2014 which we cultivate with such assiduity after our return to Paris as the friendships that we have formed by the sea. I was anxious about the opinion that might be held of me by all these temporary or local celebrities whom my tendency to put myself in the place of other people and to reconstruct what was in their minds had made me place not in their true rank, that which they would have held in Paris, for instance, and which would have been quite low, but in that which they must imagine to be, and which indeed was their rank at Balbec, where the want of a common denominator gave them a sort of relative superiority and an individual interest. Alas, none of these people\u2019s contempt for me was so unbearable as that of M. de Stermaria\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For I had noticed his daughter, the moment she came into the room, her pretty features, her pallid, almost blue complexion, what there was peculiar in the carriage of her tall figure, in her gait, which suggested to me \u2014 and rightly \u2014 her long descent, her aristocratic upbringing, all the more vividly because I knew her name, like those expressive themes composed by musicians of genius which paint in splendid colours the glow of fire, the rush of water, the peace of fields and woods, to audiences who, having first let th\u00e7ir eyes run over the programme, have their imaginations trained in the right direction. The label \u2018Centuries of Breeding,\u2019 by adding to Mlle, de Stermaria\u2019s charms the idea of their origin, made them more desirable also, advertising their rarity as a high price enhances the value of a thing that has already taken our fancy. And its stock of heredity gave to her complexion, in which so many selected juices had been blended, the savour of an exotic fruit or of a famous vintage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then mere chance put into our hands, my grandmother\u2019s and mine, the means of giving ourselves an immediate distinction in the eyes of all the other occupants of the hotel. On that first afternoon, at the moment when the old lady came downstairs from her room, producing, thanks to the footman who preceded her, the maid who came running after her with a book and a rug that had been left behind, a marked effect upon all who beheld her and arousing in each of them a curiosity from which it was evident that none was so little immune as M. de Stermaria, the manager leaned across to my grandmother and, from pure kindness of heart (as one might point out the Shah, or Queen Ranavalo to an obscure onlooker who could obviously have no sort of connexion with so mighty a potentate, but might be interested, all the same, to know that he had been standing within a few feet of one) whispered in her ear, \u201cThe Marquise de Villeparisis!\u201d while at the same moment the old lady, catching sight of my grandmother,-could not repress a start of pleased surprise\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It may be imagined that the sudden appearance, in the guise of a. little old woman, of the most powerful of fairies would not have given me so much pleasure, destitute as I was of any means of access to Mlle, de Stermaria, in a strange place where I knew no one: no one, that is to say, for any practical purpose. Aesthetically the number of types of humanity is so restricted that we must constantly, wherever we may be, have the pleasure of seeing people we know, even without looking for them in the works of the old masters, like Swann. Thus it happened that in the first few days of our visit to Balbec I had succeeded in finding Legrandin, Swann\u2019s hall porter and Mme. Swann herself, transformed into a waiter, a foreign visitor whom I never saw again and a bathing superintendent. And a sort of magnetism attracts and retains so inseparably, one after another, certain characteristics, facial and mental, that when nature thus introduces a person into a new body she does not mutilate him unduly. Legrandin turned waiter kept intact his stature, the outline of his nose, part of his chin; Mme. Swann, in the masculine gender and the calling of a bathing superintendent, had been accompanied not only by familiar features, but even by the way she had of speaking. Only, she could be of little if any more use to me, standing upon the beach there in the red sash of her office, and hoisting at the first gust of wind the flag which forbade us to bathe (for these superintendents are prudent men, and seldom know how to swim) than she would have been in that fresco of the Life of Moses in which Swann had long ago identified her in the portrait of Jethro\u2019s Daughter. Whereas this Mme. de Villeparisis was her real self, she had not been the victim of an enchantment which had deprived her of her power, but was capable, on the contrary, of putting at the service of my power an enchantment which would multiply it an hundredfold, and thanks to which, as though I had been swept through the air on the wings of a fabulous bird, I was to cross in a few moments the infinitely wide (at least, at Balbec) social gulf which separated me from Mlle, de Stermaria\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, if there was one person in the world who, more than anyone else, lived shut up in a little world of her own, it was my grandmother. She would not, indeed, have despised me, she would simply not have understood what I meant had she been told that I attached importance to the opinions, that I felt an interest in the persons of people the very existence of whom she had never noticed and would, when the time came to leave Balbec, retain no impression of their names. I dared not confess to her that if these same people had seen her talking to Mme. de Villeparisis, I should have been immensely gratified, because I felt that the Marquise counted for much in the hotel and that her friendship would have given us a position in the eyes of Mlle, de Stermaria. Not that my grandmother\u2019s friend represented to me, in any sense of the word, a member of the aristocracy: I was too well used to her name, which had been familiar to my ears before my mind had begun to consider it, when as a child I had heard it occur in conversation at home: while her title added to it only a touch of quaintness \u2014 as some uncommon Christian name would have done, or as in the names of streets, among which we can see nothing more noble in the Rue Lord Byron, in the plebeian and even squalid Rue Rochechouart, or in the Rue Grammont than in the Rue L\u00e9once Reynaud or the Rue Hyppolyte Lebas. Mme. de Villeparisis no more made me think of a person who belonged to a special world than did her cousin MacMahon, whom I did not clearly distinguish from M. Carnot, likewise President of the Republic, or from Raspail, whose photograph Fran\u00e7oise had bought with that of Pius IX. It was one of my grandmother\u2019s principles that, when away from home, one should cease to have any social intercourse, that one did not go to the seaside to meet people, having plenty of time for that sort of thing in Paris, that they would make one waste on being merely polite, in pointless conversation, the precious time which ought all to be spent in the open air, beside the waves; and finding it convenient to assume that this view was shared by everyone else, and that it authorised, between old friends whom chance brought face to face in the same hotel, the fiction of a mutual incognito, on hearing her friend\u2019s name from the manager she merely looked the other way, and pretended not to see Mme. de Villeparisis, who, realising that my grandmother did not want to be recognised, looked also into the void. She went past, and I was left in my isolation like a shipwrecked mariner who has seen a vessel apparently coming towards him which has then, without lowering a boat, vanished under the horizon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She, too, had her meals in the dining-room, but at the other end of it. She knew none of the people who were staying in the hotel, or who came there to call, not even M. de Cambremer; in fact, I noticed that he gave her no greeting, one day when, with his wife, he had accepted an invitation to take luncheon with the barrister, who drunken with the honour of having the nobleman at his table avoided his friends of every day, and confined himself to a distant twitch of the eyelid, so as to draw their attention to this historic event but so discreetly that his signal could not be interpreted by them as an invitation to join the party\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, I hope you\u2019ve got on your best clothes; I hope you feel smart enough,\u201d was the magistrate\u2019s wife\u2019s greeting to him that evening\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSmart? Why should I?\u201d asked the barrister, concealing his rapture in an exaggerated astonishment. \u201cBecause of my guests, do you mean?\u201d he went on, feeling that it was impossible to keep up the farce any longer. \u201cBut what is there smart about having a few friends in to luncheon? After all, they must feed somewhere!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut it is smart! They are the de Cambremers, aren\u2019t they? I recognized them at once. She is a Marquise. And quite genuine, too. Not through the females.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, she\u2019s a very simple soul, she is charming, no stand-offishness about her. I thought you were coming to join us. I was making signals to you . . . I would have introduced you!\u201d he asserted, tempering with a hint of irony the vast generosity of the offer, like Ahasuerus when he says to Esther:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of all my Kingdom must I give you half!\n\n\u201cNo, no, no, no! We lie hidden, like the modest violet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut you were quite wrong, I assure you,\u201d replied the barrister, growing bolder now that the danger point was passed. \u201cThey weren\u2019t going to eat you. I say, aren\u2019t we going to have our little game of bezique?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, of course! We were afraid to suggest it, now that you go about entertaining Marquises.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, get along with you; there\u2019s nothing so very wonderful about them, Why, I\u2019m dining there to-morrow. Would you care to go instead of me? I mean it. Honestly, I\u2019d just as soon stay here.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no! I should be removed from the bench as a Reactionary,\u201d cried the chief magistrate, laughing till the tears stood in his eyes at his own joke. \u201cBut you go to F\u00e9terne too, don\u2019t you?\u201d he went on, turning to the solicitor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, I go there on Sundays \u2014 in at one door and out at the other. But I don\u2019t have them here to luncheon, like the Leader.\u201d M. de Stermaria was not at Balbec that day, to the barrister\u2019s great regret. But he managed to say a word in season to the head waiter:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAim\u00e9, you can tell M. de Stermaria that he\u2019s not the only nobleman you\u2019ve had in here. You saw the gentleman who was with me to-day at luncheon? Eh? A small moustache, looked like a military man. Well, that was the Marquis de Cambremer!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWas it indeed? I\u2019m not surprised to hear it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat will shew him that he\u2019s not the only man who\u2019s got a title. That will teach him! It\u2019s not a bad thing to take \u2019em down a peg or two, those noblemen. I say, Aim\u00e9, don\u2019t say anything to him unless you like: I mean to say, it\u2019s no business of mine; besides, they know each other already.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And next day M. de Stermaria, who remembered that the barrister had once held a brief for one of his friends, came up and introduced himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOur friends in common, the de Cambremers, were anxious that we should meet; the days didn\u2019t fit; I don\u2019t know quite what went wrong \u2014\u201d stammered the barrister, who, like most liars, imagined that other people do not take the trouble to investigate an unimportant detail which, for all that, may be sufficient (if chance puts you in possession of the humble facts of the case, and they contradict it) to shew the liar in his true colours and to inspire a lasting mistrust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then as at all times, but more easily now that her father had left her and was talking to the barrister, I was gazing at Mlle, de Stermaria. No less than the bold and always graceful originality of her attitudes, as when, leaning her elbows on the table, she raised her glass in both hands over her outstretched arms, the dry flame of a glance at once extinguished, the ingrained, congenital hardness that one could feel, ill-concealed by her own personal inflexions, in the sound of her voice, which had shocked my grandmother; a sort of atavistic starting point to which she recoiled whenever, by glance or utterance, she had succeeded in expressing a thought of her own; all of these qualities carried the mind of him who watched her back to the line of ancestors who had bequeathed to her that inadequacy of human sympathy, those blanks in her sensibility, that short measure of humanity which was at every moment running out. But from a certain look which flooded for a moment the wells \u2014 instantly dry again \u2014 of her eyes, a look in which I could discern that almost obsequious docility which the predominance of a taste for sensual pleasures gives to the proudest of women, who will soon come to recognise but one form of personal distinction, that namely which any man enjoys who can make her feel those pleasures, an actor, an acrobat even, for whom, perhaps, she will one day leave her husband; \u2014 from a certain rosy tint, warm and sensual, which flushed her pallid cheeks, like the colour that stained the hearts of the white water-lilies in the Vivonne, I thought I could discern that she would readily have consented to my coming to seek in her the savour of that life of poetry and romance which she led in Brittany, a life to which, whether from over-familiarity or from innate superiority, or from disgust at the penury or the avarice of her family, she seemed not to attach any great value, but which, for all that, she held enclosed in her body. In the meagre stock of will-power that had been transmitted to her, and gave an element of weakness to her expression, she would not perhaps have found the strength to resist. And, crowned by a feather that was a trifle old-fashioned and pretentious, the grey felt hat which she invariably wore at meals made her all the more attractive to me, not because it was in harmony with her pearly or rosy complexion, but because, by making me suppose her to be poor, it brought her closer to myself. Obliged by her father\u2019s presence to adopt a conventional attitude, but already bringing to the perception and classification of the people who passed before her eyes other principles than his, perhaps she saw in me not my humble rank, but the right sex and age. If one day M. de Stermaria had gone out leaving her behind, if, above all, Mme. de Villeparisis, by coming to sit at our table, had given her an opinion of me which might have emboldened me to approach her, perhaps then we might have contrived to exchange a few words, to arrange a meeting, to form a closer tie. And for a whole month during which she would be left alone, without her parents, in her romantic Breton castle, we should perhaps have been able to wander by ourselves at evening, she and I together in the dusk which would shew in a softer light above the darkening water pink briar roses, beneath oak trees beaten and stunted by the hammering of the waves. Together we should have roamed that isle impregnated with so intense a charm for me because it had enclosed the everyday life of Mlle, de Stermaria and lay at rest in her remembering eyes. For it seemed to me that I should not really have possessed her save there, when I should have traversed those regions which enveloped her in so many memories \u2014 a veil which my desire sought to tear apart, one of those veils which nature interposes between woman and her pursuers (with the same intention as when, for all of us, she places the act of reproduction between ourselves and our keenest pleasure, and for insects, places before the nectar the pollen which they must carry away with them) in order that, tricked by the illusion of possessing her thus more completely, they may be forced to occupy first the scenes among which she lives, and which, of more service to their imagination than sensual pleasure can be, yet would not without that pleasure have had the power to attract them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But I was obliged to take my eyes from Mlle, de Stermaria, for already, considering no doubt that making the acquaintance of an important person was a brief, inquisitive act which was sufficient in itself, and to bring out all the interest that was latent in it required only a handshake and a penetrating stare, without either immediate conversation or any subsequent relations, her father had taken leave of the barrister and returned to sit down facing her, rubbing his hands like a man who has just made a valuable acquisition. As for the barrister, once the first emotion of this interview had subsided, then, as on other days, he could be heard every minute addressing the head waiter:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I am not a king, Aim\u00e9; go and attend to the king! I say, Chief, those little trout don\u2019t look at all bad, do they? We must ask Aim\u00e9 to let us have some. Aim\u00e9, that little fish you have over there looks to me highly commendable; will you bring us some, please, Aim\u00e9, and don\u2019t be sparing with it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He would repeat the name \u2018Aim\u00e9\u2019 all day long, one result of which was that when he had anyone to dinner the guest would remark \u201cI can see, you are quite at home in this place,\u201d and would feel himself obliged to keep, on saying \u2018Aim\u00e9\u2019 also, from that tendency, combining elements of timidity, vulgarity and silliness, which many people have, to believe that it is smart and witty to copy to the letter what is said by the company in which they may happen to be. The barrister repeated the name incessantly, but with a smile, for he felt that he was exhibiting at once the good terms on which he stood with the head waiter and his own superior station. And the head waiter, whenever he caught the sound of his own name, smiled too, as though touched and at the same time proud, shewing that he was conscious of the honour and could appreciate the pleasantry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Terrifying as I always found these meals, in the vast restaurant, generally full, of the mammoth hotel, they became even more terrifying when there arrived for a few days the Proprietor (or he may have been only the General Manager, appointed by a board of directors) not only of this \u2018palace\u2019 but of seven or eight more besides, situated at all the four corners of France, in each of which, travelling continuously, he would spend a week now and again. Then, just after dinner had begun, there appeared every evening in the doorway of the dining-room this small man with white hair and a red nose, astonishingly neat and impassive, who was known, it appeared, as well in London as at Monte-Carlo, as one of the leading hotel-keepers in Europe. Once when I had gone out for a moment at the beginning of dinner, as I came in again I passed close by him, and he bowed to me, but with a coldness in which I could not distinguish whether it should be attributed to the reserve of a man who could never forget what he was, or to his contempt for a customer of so little importance. To those whose importance was considerable the Managing Director would bow, with quite as much coldness but more deeply, lowering his eyelids with a reverence that was almost offended modesty, as though he had found himself confronted, at a funeral, with the father of the deceased or with the Blessed Sacrament. Except for these icy and infrequent salutations, he made not the slightest movement, as if to show that his glittering eyes, which appeared to be starting out of his head, saw everything, controlled everything, assured to us in the \u2018Hotel dinner\u2019 perfection in every detail as well as a general harmony. He felt, evidently, that he was more than the producer of a play, than the conductor of an orchestra, nothing less than a general in supreme command. Having decided that a contemplation carried to its utmost intensity would suffice to assure him that everything was in readiness, that no mistake had been made which could lead to disaster \u2014 to invest him, in a word, with full responsibility, he abstained not merely from any gesture but even from moving his eyes, which, petrified by the intensity of their gaze, took in and directed everything that was going on. I felt that even the movements of my spoon did not escape him, and were he to vanish after the soup, for the whole of dinner the review that he had held would have taken away my appetite. His own was exceedingly good, as one could see at luncheon, which he took like an ordinary guest of the hotel at a table that anyone else might have had in the public dining-room. His table had this peculiarity only, that by his side, while he was eating, the other manager, the resident one, remained standing all the time to make conversation. For being subordinate to this Managing Director he was anxious to please a man of whom he lived in constant fear. My fear of him diminished during these luncheons, for being then lost in the crowd of visitors he would exercise the discretion of a general sitting in a restaurant where there are also private soldiers, in not seeming to take any notice of them. Nevertheless when the porter, from among a cluster of pages, announced to me: \u201cHe leaves to-morrow morning for Dinard. Then he\u2019s going down to Biarritz, and after that to Cannes,\u201d I began to breathe more freely\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My life in the hotel was rendered not only dull because I had no friends there but uncomfortable because Fran\u00e7oise had made so many. It might be thought that they would have made things easier for us in various respects. Quite the contrary. The proletariat, if they succeeded only with great difficulty in being treated as people she knew by Fran\u00e7oise, and could not succeed at all unless they fulfilled the condition of shewing the utmost politeness to her, were, on the other hand, once they had reached the position, the only people who \u2018counted.\u2019 Her time-honoured code taught her that she was in no way bound to the friends of her employers, that she might, if she was busy, shut the door without ceremony in the face of a lady who had come to call on my grandmother. But towards her own acquaintance, that is to say, the select handful of the lower orders whom she admitted to an unconquerable intimacy, her actions were regulated by the most subtle and most stringent of protocols. Thus Fran\u00e7oise having made the acquaintance of the man in the coffee-shop and of a little maid who did dressmaking for a Belgian lady, no longer came upstairs immediately after luncheon to get my grandmother\u2019s things ready, but came an hour later, because the coffee man had wanted to make her a cup of coffee or a tisane in his shop, or the maid had invited her to go and watch her sew, and to refuse either of them would have been impossible, and one of the things that were not done. Moreover, particular attention was due to the little sewing-maid, who was an orphan and had been brought up by strangers to whom she still went occasionally for a few days\u2019 holiday. Her unusual situation aroused Franchise\u2019s pity, and also a benevolent contempt. She, who had a family, a little house that had come to her from her parents, with a field in which her brother kept his cows, how could she regard so uprooted a creature as her equal? And since this girl hoped, on Assumption Day, to be allowed to pay her benefactors a visit, Fran\u00e7oise kept on repeating: \u201cShe does make me laugh! She says, \u2018I hope to be going home for the Assumption.\u2019 \u2018Home!\u2019 says she! It isn\u2019t just that it\u2019s not her own place, they\u2019re people who took her in from nowhere, and the creature says \u2018home\u2019 just as if it really was her home. Poor girl! What a wretched state she must be in, not to know what it is to have a home.\u201d Still, if Fran\u00e7oise had associated only with the ladies\u2019-maids brought to the hotel by other visitors, who fed with her in the \u2018service\u2019 quarters and, seeing her grand lace cap and her handsome profile, took her perhaps for some lady of noble birth, whom \u2018reduced circumstances,\u2019 or a personal attachment had driven to serve as companion to my grandmother, if in a word Fran\u00e7oise had known only people who did not belong to the hotel, no great harm would have been done, since she could not have prevented them from doing us any service, for the simple reason that in no circumstances, even without her knowledge, would it have been possible for them to serve us at all. But she had formed connexions also with one of the wine waiters, with a man in the kitchen, and with the head chambermaid of our landing. And the result of this in our everyday life was that Fran\u00e7oise, who on the day of her arrival, when she still did not know anypne, would set all the bells jangling for the slightest thing, at an hour when my grandmother and I would never have dared to ring, and if we offered some gentle admonition answered: \u201cWell, we\u2019re paying enough for it, aren\u2019t we?\u201d as though it were she herself that would have to pay; nowadays, since she had made friends with a personage in the kitchen, which had appeared to us to augur well for our future comfort, were my grandmother or I to complain of cold feet, Fran\u00e7oise, even at an hour that was quite normal, dared not ring; she assured us that it would give offence because they would have to light the furnace again, or because it would interrupt the servants\u2019 dinner and they would be annoyed. And she ended with a formula that, in spite of the ambiguous way in which she uttered it, was none the less clear, and put us plainly in the wrong: \u201cThe fact is . . . \u201d We did not insist, for fear of bringing upon ourselves another, far more serious: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter . . .!\u201d So that it amounted to this, that we could no longer have any hot water because Fran\u00e7oise had become a friend of the man who would have to heat it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the end we too formed a connexion, in spite of but through my grandmother, for she and Mme. de Villeparisis came in collision one morning in a doorway and were obliged to accost each other, not without having first exchanged gestures of surprise and hesitation, performed movements of recoil and uncertainty, and finally uttered protestations of joy and greeting, as in some of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays, where two actors who have been delivering long soliloquies from opposite sides of the stage, a few feet apart, are supposed not to have seen each other yet, and then suddenly catch sight of each other, cannot believe their eyes, break off what they are saying and finally address each other (the chorus having meanwhile kept the dialogue going) and fall into each other\u2019s arms. Mme. de Villeparisis was tactful, and made as if to leave my grandmother to herself after the first greetings, but my grandmother insisted on her staying to talk to her until luncheon, being anxious to discover how her friend managed to get her letters sent up to her earlier than we got ours, and to get such nice grilled things (for Mme. de Villeparisis, a great epicure, had the poorest opinion of the hotel kitchen which served us with meals that my grandmother, still quoting Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, described as \u201cof a magnificence to make you die of hunger.\u201d) And the Marquise formed the habit of coming every day, until her own meal was ready, to sit down for a moment at our table in the dining-room, insisting that we should not rise from our chairs or in any way put ourselves out. At the most we would linger, as often as not, in the room after finishing our luncheon, to talk to her, at that sordid moment when the knives are left littering the tablecloth among crumpled napkins. For my own part, so as to preserve (in order that I might be able to enjoy Balbec) the idea that I was on the uttermost promontory of the earth, I compelled myself to look farther afield, to notice only the sea, to seek in it the effects described by Baudelaire and to let my gaze fall upon our table only on days when there was set on it some gigantic fish, some marine monster, which unlike the knives and forks was contemporary with the primitive epochs in which the Ocean first began to teem with life, in the Cimmerians\u2019 time, a fish whose body with its numberless vertebrae, its blue veins and red, had been constructed by nature, but according to an architectural plan, like a polychrome cathedral of the deep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a barber, seeing an officer whom he is accustomed to shave with special deference and care recognise a customer who has just entered the shop and stop for a moment to talk to him, rejoices in the thought that these are two men of the same social order, and cannot help smiling as he goes to fetch the bowl of soap, for he knows that in his establishment,\u2019 to the vulgar routine of a mere barber\u2019s-shop, are being added social, not to say aristocratic pleasures, so Aim\u00e9, seeing that Mme. de Villeparisis had found in us old friends, went to fetch our finger-bowls with precisely the smile, proudly modest and knowingly discreet, of a hostess who knows when to leave her guests to themselves. He suggested also a pleased and loving father who looks on, without interfering, at the happy pair who have plighted their troth at his hospitable board. Besides, it was enough merely to utter the name of a person of title for Aim\u00e9 to appear pleased, unlike Fran\u00e7oise, before whom you could not mention Count So-and-so without her face darkening and her speech becoming dry and sharp, all of which meant that she worshipped the aristocracy not less than Aim\u00e9 but far more. But then Fran\u00e7oise had that quality which in others she condemned as the worst possible fault; she was proud. She was not of that friendly and good-humoured race to which Aim\u00e9 belonged. They feel, they exhibit an intense delight when you tell them a piece of news which may be more or less sensational but is at any rate new, and not to be found in the papers. Fran\u00e7oise declined to appear surprised. You might have announced in her hearing that the Archduke Rudolf \u2014 not that she had the least suspicion of his having ever existed \u2014 was not, as was generally supposed, dead, but \u2018alive and kicking\u2019; she would have answered only \u2018Yes,\u2019 as though she had known it all the time. It may, however, have been that if even from our own lips, from us whom she so meekly called her masters, who had so nearly succeeded in taming her, she could not, without having to check an angry start, hear the name of a noble, that was because the family from which she had sprung occupied in its own village a comfortable and independent position, and was not to be threatened in the consideration which it enjoyed save by those same nobles, in whose households, meanwhile, from his boyhood, an Aim\u00e9 would have been domiciled as a servant, if not actually brought up by their charity. Of Fran\u00e7oise, then, Mme. de Villeparisis must ask pardon, first, for her nobility. But (in France, at any rate) that is precisely the talent, in fact the sole occupation of our great gentlemen and ladies. Fran\u00e7oise, following the common tendency of servants, who pick up incessantly from the conversation of their masters with other people fragmentary observations from which they are apt to draw erroneous inductions, as the human race generally does with respect to the habits of animals, was constantly discovering that somebody had \u2018failed\u2019 us, a conclusion to which she was easily led, not so much, perhaps, by her extravagant love for us, as by the delight that she took in being disagreeable to us. But having once established, without possibility of error, the endless little attentions paid to us, and paid to herself also by Mme. de Villeparisis, Fran\u00e7oise forgave her for being a Marquise, and, as she had never ceased to be proud of her because she was one, preferred her thenceforward to all our other friends. It must be added that no one else took the trouble to be so continually nice to us. Whenever my grandmother remarked on a book that Mme. de Villeparisis was reading, or said she had been admiring the fruit which some one had just sent to our friend, within an hour the footman would come to our rooms with book or fruit. And the next time we saw her, in response to our thanks, she would say only, seeming to seek some excuse for the meagreness of her present in some special use to which it might be put: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing wonderful, but the newspapers come so late here, one must have something to read.\u201d Or, \u201cIt is always wiser to have fruit one can be quite certain of, at the seaside.\u201d\u2014\u201cBut I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever seen you eating oysters,\u201d she said to us, increasing the sense of disgust which I felt at that moment, for the living flesh of the oyster revolted me even more than the gumminess of the stranded jellyfish defiled for me the beach at Balbec; \u201cthey are delicious down here! Oh, let me tell my maid to fetch your letters when she goes for mine. What, your daughter writes every day? But what on earth can you find to say to each other?\u201d My grandmother was silent, but it may be assumed that her silence was due to scorn, in her who used to repeat, when she wrote to Mamma, the words of Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u201cAs soon as I have received a letter, I want another at once; I cannot breathe until it comes. There are few who are worthy to understand what I mean.\u201d And I was afraid of her applying to Mme. de Villeparisis the conclusion: \u201cI seek out those who are of the chosen few, and I avoid the rest.\u201d She fell back upon praise of the fruit which Mme. de Villeparisis had sent us the day before. And this had been, indeed, so fine that the manager, in spite of the jealousy aroused by our neglect of his official offerings, had said to me: \u201cI am like you; I\u2019m madder about fruit than any other kind of dessert.\u201d My grandmother told her friend that she had enjoyed them all the more because the fruit which we got in the hotel was generally horrid. \u201cI cannot,\u201d she went on, \u201csay, like Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, that if we should take a sudden fancy for bad fruit we should be obliged to order it from Paris.\u201d \u201cOh yes, of course, you read Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. I saw you with her letters the day you came.\u201d (She forgot that she had never officially seen my grandmother in the hotel until their collision in the doorway.) \u201cDon\u2019t you find it rather exaggerated, her constant anxiety about her daughter? She refers to it too often to be really sincere. She is not natural.\u201d My grandmother felt that any discussion would be futile, and so as not to be obliged to speak of the things she loved to a person incapable of understanding them, concealed by laying her bag upon them the M\u00e9moires de Mme. de Beausergent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were she to encounter Fran\u00e7oise at the moment (which Fran\u00e7oise called \u2018the noon\u2019) when, wearing her fine cap and surrounded with every mark of respect, she was coming downstairs to \u2018feed with the service,\u2019 Mme. Villeparisis would stop her to ask after us. And Fran\u00e7oise, when transmitting to us the Marquise\u2019s message: \u201cShe said to me, \u2018You\u2019ll be sure and bid them good day,\u2019 she said,\u201d counterfeited the voice of Mme. de Villeparisis, whose exact words she imagined herself to be quoting textu-ally, whereas she was really corrupting them no less than Plato corrupts the words of Socrates or Saint John the words of Jesus. Fran\u00e7oise, as was natural, was deeply touched by these attentions. Only she did not believe my grandmother, but supposed that she must be lying in the interest of her class (the rich always combining thus to support one another) when she assured us that Mme. de Villeparisis had been lovely as a young woman. It was true that of this loveliness only the faintest trace remained, from which no one \u2014 unless he happened to be a great deal more of an artist than Fran\u00e7oise \u2014 would have been able to restore her ruined beauty. For in order to understand how beautiful an elderly woman can once have been one must not only study but interpret every line of her face\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI must remember, some time, to ask her whether I\u2019m not right, after all, in thinking that there is some connexion with the Guermantes,\u201d said my grandmother, to my great indignation. How could I be expected to believe in a common origin uniting two names which had entered my consciousness, one through the low and shameful gate of experience, the other by the golden gate of imagination?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We had several times, in the last few days, seen driving past us in a stately equipage, tall, auburn, handsome, with a rather prominent nose, the Princesse de Luxembourg, who was staying in the neighbourhood for a few weeks. Her carriage had stopped outside the hotel, a footman had come in and spoken to the manager, had gone back to the carriage and had reappeared with the most amazing armful of fruit (which combined in a single basket, like the bay itself, different seasons) with a card: \u201cLa Princesse de Luxembourg,\u201d on which were scrawled a few words in pencil. For what princely traveller sojourning here incognito, could they be intended, those glaucous plums, luminous and spherical as was at that moment the circumfluent sea, transparent grapes clustering on a shrivelled stick, like a fine day in autumn, pears of a heavenly ultramarine? For it could not be on my grandmother\u2019s friend that the Princess had meant to pay a call. And yet on the following evening Mme. de Villeparisis sent us the bunch of grapes, cool, liquid, golden; plums too and pears which we remembered, though the plums had changed, like the sea at our dinner-hour, to a dull purple, and on the ultramarine surface of the pears there floated the forms of a few rosy clouds. A few days later we met Mme. de Villeparisis as we came away from the symphony concert that was given every morning on the beach. Convinced that the music to which I had been listening (the Prelude to Lohengrin, the Overture to Tannh\u00e4user and suchlike) expressed the loftiest of truths, I was trying to elevate myself, as far as I could, so as to attain to a comprehension of them, I was extracting from myself so as to understand them, and was attributing to them, all that was best and most profound in my own nature at that time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well, as we came out of the concert, and, on our way back to the hotel, had stopped for a moment on the \u2018front,\u2019 my grandmother and I, for a few words with Mme. de Villeparisis who told us that she had ordered somecroque-monsieurs and a dish of creamed eggs for us at the hotel, I saw, a long way away, coming in our direction, the Princesse de Luxembourg, half leaning upon a parasol in such a way as to impart to her tall and wonderful form that slight inclination, to make it trace that arabesque dear to the women who had been beautiful under the Empire, and knew how, with drooping shoulders, arched backs, concave hips and bent limbs, to make their bodies float as gently as a silken scarf about the rigidity of the invisible stem which might be supposed to have been passed diagonally through them. She went out every morning for a turn on the beach almost at the time when everyone else, after bathing, was climbing home to luncheon, and as hers was not until half past one she did not return to her villa until long after the hungry bathers had left the scorching \u2018front\u2019 a desert. Mme. de Villeparisis presented my grandmother and would have presented me, but had first to ask me my name, which she could not remember. She had, perhaps, never known it, or if she had must have forgotten years ago to whom my grandmother had married her daughter. My name, when she did hear it, appeared to impress Mme. de Villeparisis considerably. Meanwhile the Princesse de Luxembourg had given us her hand and, now and again, while she conversed with the Marquise, turned to bestow a kindly glance on my grandmother and myself, with that embryonic kiss which we put into our smiles when they are addressed to a baby out with its \u2018Nana.\u2019 Indeed, in her anxiety not to appear to be a denizen of a higher sphere than ours, she had probably miscalculated the distance there was indeed between us, for by an error in adjustment she made her eyes beam with such benevolence that I could see the moment approaching when she would put out her hand and stroke us, as if we were two nice beasts and had poked our heads out at her through the bars of our cage in the Gardens. And, immediately, as it happened, this idea of caged animals and the Bois de Boulogne received striking confirmation. It was the time of day at which the beach is crowded by itinerant and clamorous vendors, hawking cakes and sweets and biscuits. Not knowing quite what to do to shew her affection for us, the Princess hailed the next that came by; he had nothing left but one rye-cake, of the kind one throws to the ducks. The Princess took it and said to me: \u201cFor your grandmother.\u201d And yet it was to me that she held it out, saying with a friendly smile, \u201cYou shall give it to her yourself!\u201d thinking that my pleasure would thus be more complete if there were no intermediary between myself and the animals. Other vendors came up; she stuffed my pockets with everything that they had, tied up in packets, comfits, sponge-cakes, sugar-sticks. \u201cYou will eat some yourself,\u201d she told me, \u201cand give some to your grandmother,\u201d and she had the vendors paid by the little Negro page, dressed in red satin, who followed her everywhere and was a nine days\u2019 wonder upon the beach. Then she said good-bye to Mme. de Villeparisis and held out her hand to us with the intention of treating us in the same way as she treated her friend, as people whom she knew, and of bringing herself within our reach. But this time she must have reckoned our level as not quite so low in the scale of creation, for her and our equality was indicated by the Princess to my grandmother by that tender and maternal smile which a woman gives a little boy when she says good-bye to him as though to a grown-up person. By a miraculous stride in evolution, my grandmother was no longer a duck or an antelope, but had already become what the anglophil Mme. Swann would have called a \u2018baby.\u2019 Finally, having taken leave of us all, the Princess resumed her stroll along the basking \u2018front,\u2019 curving her splendid shape which, like a serpent coiled about a wand, was interlaced with the white parasol patterned in blue which Mme. de Luxembourg held, unopened, in her hand. She was my first Royalty \u2014 I say my first, for strictly speaking Princesse Mathilde did not count. The second, as we shall see in due course, was to astonish me no less by her indulgence. One of the ways in which our great nobles, kindly intermediaries between commoners and kings, can befriend us was revealed to me next day when Mme. de Villeparisis reported: \u201cShe thought you quite charming. She is a woman of the soundest judgment, the warmest heart. Not like so many Queens and people! She has real merit.\u201d And Mme. de Villeparisis went on in a tone of conviction, and quite thrilled to be able to say it to us: \u201cI am sure she would be delighted to see you again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But on that previous morning, after we had parted from the Princesse de Luxembourg, Mme. de Villeparisis said a thing which impressed me far more and was not prompted merely by friendly feeling\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAre you,\u201d she had asked me, \u201cthe son of the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry? Indeed! I am told your father is a most charming man. He is having a splendid holiday just now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few days earlier we had heard, in a letter from Mamma, that my father and his friend M. de Norpois had lost their luggage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt has been found; as a matter of fact, it was never really lost, I can tell you what happened,\u201d explained Mme. de Villeparisis, who, without our knowing how, seemed to be far better informed than ourselves of the course of my father\u2019s travels. \u201cI think your father is now planning to come home earlier, next week, in fact, as he will probably give up the idea of going to Algeciras. But he is anxious to devote a day longer to Toledo; it seems, he is an admirer of a pupil of Titian \u2014 I forget the name \u2014 whose work can only be seen properly there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I asked myself by what strange accident, in the impartial glass through which Mme. de Villeparisis considered, from a safe distance, the bustling, tiny, purposeless agitation of the crowd of people whom she knew, there had come to be inserted at the spot through which she observed rhy father a fragment of prodigious magnifying power which made her see in such high relief and in the fullest detail everything that there was attractive about him, the contingencies that were obliging him to return home, his difficulties with the customs, his admiration for El Greco, and, altering the scale of her vision, shewed her this one man so large among all the rest quite small, like that Jupiter to whom Gustave Moreau gave, when he portrayed him by the side of a weak mortal, a superhuman stature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother bade Mme. de Villeparisis good-bye, so that we might stay and imbibe the fresh air for a little while longer outside the hotel, until they signalled to us through the glazed partition that our luncheon was ready. There were sounds of tumult. The young mistress of the King of the Cannibal Island had been down to bathe and was now coming back to the hotel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReally and truly, it\u2019s a perfect plague: it\u2019s enough to make one decide to emigrate!\u201d cried the barrister, who had happened to cross her path, in a towering rage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile the solicitor\u2019s wife was following the bogus Queen with eyes that seemed ready to start from their sockets\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how angry Mme. Blandais makes me when she stares at those people like that,\u201d said the barrister to the chief magistrate, \u201cI feel I want to slap her. That is just the way to make the wretches appear important; and of course that\u2019s the very thing they want, that people should take an interest in them. Do ask her husband to tell her what a fool she\u2019s making of herself. I swear I won\u2019t go out with them again if they stop and gape at those masqueraders.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the coming of the Princesse de Luxembourg, whose carriage, on the day on which she left the fruit, had drawn up outside the hotel, it had not passed unobserved by the little group of wives, the solicitor\u2019s, the barrister\u2019s and the magistrate\u2019s, who had for some time past been most concerned to know whether she was a genuine Marquise and not an adventuress, that Mme. de Villeparisis whom everyone treated with so much respect, which all these ladies were burning to hear that she did not deserve. Whenever Mme. de Villeparisis passed through the hall the chief magistrate\u2019s wife, who scented irregularities everywhere, would raise her eyes from her \u2018work\u2019 and stare at the intruder in a way that made her friends die of laughter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, well, you know,\u201d she explained with lofty condescension, \u201cI always begin by believing the worst. I will never admit that a woman is properly married until she has shewn me her birth certificate and her marriage lines. But there\u2019s no need to alarm yourselves; just wait till I\u2019ve finished my little investigation.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, day after day the ladies would come together, and, laughingly, ask one another: \u201cAny news?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But on the evening after the Princesse de Luxembourg\u2019s call the magistrate\u2019s wife laid a finger on her lips\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve discovered something.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, isn\u2019t Mme. Poncin simply wonderful? I never saw anyone. . . . But do tell us! What has happened?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust listen to this. A woman with yellow hair and six inches of paint on her face and a carriage like a \u2014 you could smell it a mile off; which only a creature like that would dare to have \u2014 came here to-day to call on the Marquise, by way of!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh-yow-yow! Tut-tut-tut-tut. Did you ever! Why, it must be that woman we saw \u2014 you remember, Leader \u2014 we said at the time we didn\u2019t at all like the look of her, but we didn\u2019t know that it was the \u2018Marquise\u2019 she\u00eed come to see. A woman with a nigga-boy, you mean?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cD\u2019you mean to say so? You don\u2019t happen to know her name?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, I made a mistake on purpose; I picked up her card; she tradesunder the name of the \u2018Princesse de Luxembourg!\u2019 Wasn\u2019t I right to have my doubts about her? It\u2019s a nice thing to have to mix promiscuously with a Baronne d\u2019Ange like that?\u201d The barrister quoted Mathurin R\u00e9gnier\u2019sMacette to the chief magistrate\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must not, however, be supposed that this misunderstanding was merely temporary, like those that occur in the second act of a farce to be cleared up before the final curtain. Mme. de Luxembourg, a niece of the King of England and of the Emperor of Austria, and Mme. de Villeparisis, when one called to take the other for a drive, did look like nothing but two \u2018old trots\u2019 of the kind one has always such difficulty in avoiding at a watering place. Nine tenths of the men of the Faubourg Saint-Germain appear to the average man of the middle class simply as alcoholic wasters (which, individually, they not infrequently are) whom, therefore, no respectable person would dream of asking to dinner. The middle class fixes its standard, in this respect, too high, for the feelings of these men would never prevent their being received with every mark of esteem in houses which it, the middle class, may never enter. And so sincerely do they believe that the middle class knows this that they affect a simplicity in speaking of their own affairs and a tone of disparagement of their friends, especially when they are \u2018at the coast,\u2019 which make the misunderstanding complete. If, by any chance, a man of the fashionable world is kept in touch with \u2018business people\u2019 because, having more money than he knows what to do with, he finds himself elected chairman of all sorts of important financial concerns, the business man who at last sees a nobleman worthy, he considers, to rank with \u2018big business,\u2019 would take his oath that such a man can have no dealings with the Marquis ruined by gambling whom the said business man supposes to be all the more destitute of friends the more friendly he makes himself. And he cannot get over his surprise when the Duke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the colossal undertaking, arranges a marriage for his son with the daughter of that very Marquis, who may be a gambler but who bears the oldest name in France, just as a Sovereign would sooner see his son marry the daughter of a dethroned King than that of a President still in office. That is to say, the two worlds take as fantastic! a view of one another as the inhabitants of a town situated at one end of Balbec Bay have of the town at the other end: from Rivebelle you can just see Marcouville l\u2019Orgueilleuse; but even that is deceptive, for you imagine that you are seen from Marcouville, where, as a matter of fact, the splendours of Rive-belle are almost wholly invisible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Balbec doctor, who had been called in to cope with a sudden feverish attack, having given the opinion that I ought not to stay out all day on the beach, in the blazing sun, without shelter, and having written out various prescriptions for my use, my grandmother took his prescriptions with a show of respect in which I could at once discern her firm resolve not to have any of them \u2018made up,\u2019 but did pay attention to his advice on the matter of hygiene, and accepted an offer from Mme. de Villeparisis to take us for drives in her carriage. After this I would spend the mornings, until luncheon, going to and fro between my own room and my grandmother\u2019s. Hers did not look out directly upon the sea, as mine did, but was lighted from three of its four sides \u2014 with views of a strip of the \u2018front,\u2019 of a well inside the building, and of the country inland, and was furnished differently from mine, with armchairs upholstered in a metallic tissue with red flowers from which seemed to emanate the cool and pleasant odour that greeted me when I entered the room. And at that hour when the sun\u2019s rays, coming from different aspects and, as it were, from different hours of the day, broke the angles of the wall, thrust in a reflexion of the beach, made of the chest of drawers a festal altar, variegated as a bank of field-flowers, attached to the wall the wings, folded, quivering, warm, of a radiance that would, at any moment, resume its flight, warmed like a bath a square of provincial carpet before the window overlooking the well, which the sun festooned and patterned like a climbing vine, added to the charm and complexity of the room\u2019s furniture by seeming to pluck and scatter the petals of the silken flowers on the chairs, and to make their silver threads stand out from the fabric, this room in which I lingered for a moment before going to get ready for our drive suggested a prism in which the colours of the light that shone outside were broken up, or a hive in which the sweet juices of the day which I was about to taste were distilled, scattered, intoxicating, visible, a garden of hope which dissolved in a quivering haze of silver threads and rose leaves. But before all this I had drawn back my own curtains, impatient to know what Sea it was that was playing that morning by the shore, like a Nereid. For none of those Seas ever stayed with us longer than a day. On the morrow there would be another, which sometimes resembled its predecessor. But I never saw the same one twice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There were some that were of so rare a beauty that my pleasure on catching sight of them was enhanced by surprise. By what privilege, on one morning rather than another, did the window on being uncurtained disclose to my wondering eyes the nymph Glauconome, whose lazy beauty, gently breathing, had the transparence of a vaporous emerald beneath whose surface I could see teeming the ponderable elements that coloured it? She made the sun join in her play, with a smile rendered languorous by an invisible haze which was nought but a space kept vacant about her translucent surface, which, thus curtailed, became more appealing, like those goddesses whom the sculptor carves in relief upon a block of marble, the rest of which he leaves unchiselled. So, in her matchless colour, she invited us out over those rough terrestrial roads, from which, seated beside Mme. de Villeparisis in her barouche, we should see, all day long and without ever reaching it, the coolness of her gentle palpitation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis used to order her carriage early, so that we should have time to reach Saint-Mars le V\u00eatu, or the rocks of Quetteholme, or some other goal which, for a somewhat lumbering vehicle, was far enough off to require the whole day. In my joy at the long drive we were going to take I would be humming some tune that I had heard recently as I strolled up and down until Mme. de Villeparisis was ready. If it was Sunday hers would not be the only carriage drawn up outside the hotel; several hired flies would be waiting there, not only for the people who had been invited to F\u00e9terne by Mme. de Cambremer, but for those who, rather than stay at home all day, like children in disgrace, declared that Sunday was always quite impossible at Balbec and started off immediately after luncheon to hide themselves in some neighbouring watering-place or to visit one of the \u2018sights\u2019 of the district. And indeed whenever (which was often) anyone asked Mme. Blandais if she had been to the Cambremers\u2019, she would answer peremptorily: \u201cNo; we went to the Falls of the Bee,\u201d as though that were the sole reason for her not having spent the day at F\u00e9teme. And the barrister would be charitable, and say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI envy you. I wish I had gone there instead; they must be well worth seeing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beside the row of carriages, in front of the porch in which I stood waiting, was planted, like some shrub of a rare species, a young page who attracted the eye no less by the unusual and effective colouring of his hair than by his plant-like epidermis. Inside, in the hall, corresponding to the narthex, or Church of the Catechumens in a primitive basilica, through which persons who were not staying in the hotel were entitled to pass, the comrades of this \u2018outside\u2019 page did not indeed work much harder than he but did at least execute certain drilled movements. It is probable that in the early morning they helped with the cleaning. But in the afternoon they stood there only like a Chorus who, even when there is nothing for them to do, remain upon the stage in order to strengthen the cast. The General Manager, the same who had so terrified me, reckoned on increasing their number considerably next year, for he had \u2018big ideas.\u2019 And this prospect greatly afflicted the manager of the hotel, who found that all these boys about the place only \u2018created a nuisance,\u2019 by which he meant that they got in the visitors\u2019 way and were of no use to anyone. But between luncheon and dinner at least, between the exits and entrances of the visitors, they did fill an otherwise empty stage, like those pupils of Mme. de Maintenon who, in the garb of young Israelites, carry on the action whenever Esther or Joad \u2018goes off.\u2019 But the outside page, with his delicate tints, his tall, slender, fragile trunk, in proximity to whom I stood waiting for the Marquise to come downstairs, preserved an immobility into which a certain melancholy entered, for his elder brothers had left the hotel for more brilliant careers elsewhere, and he felt keenly his isolation upon this alien soil. At last Mme. de Villeparisis appeared. To stand by her carriage and to help her into it ought perhaps to have been part of the young page\u2019s duties. But he knew on the one hand that a person who brings her own servants to an hotel expects them to wait on her and is not as a rule lavish with her \u2018tips,\u2019 and that generally speaking this was true also of the nobility of the old Faubourg Saint-Germain. Mme. de Villeparisis was included in both these categories. The arborescent page concluded therefore that he need expect nothing from her, and leaving her own maid and footman to pack her and her belongings into the carriage, he continued to dream sadly of the enviable lot of his brothers and preserved his vegetable immobility\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We would start off; some time after rounding the railway station, we came into a country road which soon became as familiar to me as the roads round Combray, from the bend where, like a fish-hook, it was baited with charming orchards, to the turning at which we left it, with tilled fields upon either side. Among these we could see here and there an apple-tree, stripped it was true of its blossom, and bearing no more now than a fringe of pistils, but sufficient even so to enchant me since I could imagine, seeing those inimitable leaves, how their broad expanse, like the ceremonial carpet spread for a wedding that was now over, had been but the other day swept by the white satin train of their blushing flowers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How often in Paris, during the May of the following year, was I to bring home a branch of apple-blossom from the florist, and to stay all night long before its flowers in which bloomed the same creamy essence that powdered besides and whitened the green unfolding leaves, flowers between whose snowy cups it seemed almost as though it had been the salesman who had, in his generosity towards myself, out of his wealth of invention too and as an effective contrast, added on either side the supplement of a becoming crimson bud: I sat gazing at them, I grouped them in the light of my lamp \u2014 for so long that I was often still there when the dawn brought to their whiteness the same flush with which it must at that moment have been tingeing their sisters on the Balbec road \u2014 and I sought to carry them back in my imagination to that roadside, to multiply them, to spread them out, so as to fill the frame prepared for them, on the canvas, all ready, of those closes the outline of which I knew by heart, which I so longed to see \u2014 which one day I must see again, at the moment when, with the exquisite fervour of genius, spring was covering their canvas with its colours\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before getting into the carriage I had composed the seascape for which I was going to look out, which I had hoped to see with the \u2018sun radiant\u2019 upon it, and which at Balbec I could distinguish only in too fragmentary a form, broken by so many vulgar intromissions that had no place in my dream, bathers, dressing-boxes, pleasure yachts. But when, Mme. de Ville-parisis\u2019s carriage having reached high ground, I caught a glimpse of the sea through the leafy boughs of trees, then no doubt at such a distance those temporal details which had set the sea, as it were, apart from nature and history disappeared, and I could as I looked down towards its waves make myself realise that they were the same which Leconte de Lisle describes for us in his Orestie, where \u201clike a flight of birds of prey, before the dawn of day\u201d the long-haired warriors of heroic Hellas \u201cwith oars an hundred thousand sweep the huge resounding deep.\u201d But on the other hand I was no longer near enough to the sea which seemed to me not a living thing now, but fixed; I no longer felt any power beneath its colours, spread like those of a picture among the leaves, through which it appeared as inconsistent as the sky and only of an intenser blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis, seeing that I was fond of churches, promised me that we should visit one one day and another another, and especially the church at Carqueville \u2018quite buried in all its old ivy,\u2019 as she said with a wave of the hand which seemed tastefully to be clothing the absent \u2018front\u2019 in an invisible and delicate screen of foliage. Mme. de Villeparisis would often, with this little descriptive gesture, find just the right word to define the attraction and the distinctive features of an historic building, always avoiding technical terms, but incapable of concealing her thorough understanding of the things to which she referred. She appeared to seek an excuse for this erudition in the fact that one of her father\u2019s country houses, the one in which she had lived as a girl, was situated in a district in which there were churches similar in style to those round Balbec, so that it would have been unaccountable if she had not acquired a taste for architecture, this house being, incidentally, one of the finest examples of that of the Renaissance. But as it was also a regular museum, as moreover Chopin and Liszt had played there, Lamartine recited poetry, all the most famous artists for fully a century inscribed \u2018sentiments,\u2019 scored melodies, made sketches in the family album, Mme. de Villeparisis ascribed, whether from delicacy, good breeding, true modesty or want of intelligence, only this purely material origin to her acquaintance with all the arts, and had come, apparently, to regard painting, music, literature and philosophy as the appanage of a young lady brought up on the most aristocratic lines in an historic building that was catalogued and starred. You would have said, listening to her, that she knew of no pictures that were not heirlooms. She was pleased that my grandmother liked a necklace which she wore, and which fell over her dress. It appeared in the portrait of an ancestress of her own by Titian which had never left the family. So that one could be certain of its being genuine. She would not listen to a word about pictures bought, heaven knew where, by a Croesus, she was convinced before you spoke that they were forgeries, and had so desire to see them. We knew that she herself painted flowers in water-colour, and my grandmother, who had heard these praised, spoke to her of them. Mme. de Villeparisis modestly changed the subject, but without shewing either surprise or pleasure more than would an artist whose reputation was established and to whom compliments meant nothing. She said merely that it was a delightful pastime because, even if the flowers that sprang from the brush were nothing wonderful, at least the work made you live in the company of real flowers, of the beauty of which, especially when you were obliged to study them closely in order to draw them, you could never grow tired. But at Balbec Mme. de Villeparisis was giving herself a holiday, so as to spare her eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were astonished, my grandmother and I, to find how much more \u2018Liberal\u2019 she was than even the majority of the middle class. She did not understand how anyone could be scandalised by the expulsion of the Jesuits, saying that it had always been done, even under the Monarchy, in Spain even. She took up the defence of the Republic, and against its anti-clericalism had not more to say than: \u201cI should be equally annoyed whether they prevented me from hearing mass when I wanted to, or forced me to hear it when I didn\u2019t!\u201d and even startled us with such utterances as: \u201cOh! the aristocracy in these days, what does it amount to?\u201d \u201cTo my mind, a man who doesn\u2019t work doesn\u2019t count!\u201d\u2014 perhaps only because she felt that they gained point and flavour, became memorable, in fact, on her lips\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When we heard these advanced opinions \u2014 though never so far advanced as to amount to Socialism, which Mme. de Villeparisis held in abhorrence \u2014 expressed so frequently and with so much frankness precisely by one of those people in consideration of whose intelligence our scrupulous and timid impartiality would refuse to condemn outright the ideas of the Conservatives, we came very near, my grandmother and I, to believing that in the pleasant companion of our drives was to be found the measure and the pattern of truth in all things. We took her word for it when she appreciated her Titians, the colonnade of her country house, the conversational talent of Louis-Philippe. But \u2014 like those mines of learning who hold us spellbound when we get them upon Egyptian paintings or Etruscan inscriptions, and yet talk so tediously about modern work that we ask ourselves whether we have not been over-estimating the interest of the sciences in which they are versed since there is not apparent in their treatment of them the mediocrity of mind which they must have brought to those studies just as much as to their fatuous essays on Baudelaire \u2014 Mme. de Villeparisis, questioned by me about Chateaubriand, about Balzac, about Victor Hugo, each of whom had in his day been the guest of her parents, and had been seen and spoken to by her, smiled at my reverence, told amusing anecdotes of them, such as she had a moment ago been telling us of dukes and statesmen, and severely criticised those writers simply because they had been lacking in that modesty, that self-effacement, that sober art which is satisfied with a single right line, and lays no stress on it, which avoids more than anything else the absurdity of grandiloquence, in that opportuneness, those qualities of moderation, of judgment and simplicity to which she had been taught that real greatness aspired and attained: it was evident that she had no hesitation in placing above them men who might after all, perhaps, by virtue of those qualities, have had the advantage of a Balzac, a Hugo, a Vigny in a drawing-room, an academy, a cabinet council, men like Mole, Fontanes, Vitroles, Bersot, Pasquier, Lebrun, Salvandy or Daru\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLike those novels of Stendhal, which you seem to admire. You would have given him a great surprise, I assure you, if you had spoken to him in that tone. My father, who used to meet him at M. M\u00e9rim\u00e9e\u2019s \u2014 now he was a man of talent, if you like \u2014 often told me that Beyle (that was his real name) was appallingly vulgar, but quite good company at dinner, and never in the least conceited about his books. Why, you can see for yourself how he just shrugged his shoulders at the absurdly extravagant compliments of M. de Balzac. There at least he shewed that he knew how to behave like a gentleman.\u201d She possessed the autographs of all these great men, and seemed, when she put forward the personal relations which her family had had with them, to assume that her judgment of them must be better founded than that of young people who, like myself, had had no opportunity of meeting them. \u201cI\u2019m sure I have a right to speak, for they used to come to my father\u2019s house; and as M. Sainte-Beuve, who was a most intelligent man, used to say, in forming an estimate you must take the word of people who saw them close, and were able to judge more exactly of their real worth.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes as the carriage laboured up a steep road through tilled country, making the fields more real, adding to them a mark of authenticity like the precious flower with which certain of the old masters used to sign their pictures, a few hesitating cornflowers, like the Combray cornflowers, would stream in our wake. Presently the horses outdistanced them, but a little way on we would catch sight of another which while it stayed our coming had pricked up to welcome us amid the grass its azure star; some made so bold as to come and plant themselves by the side of the road, and the impression left in my mind was a nebulous blend of distant memories and of wild flowers grown tame\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We began to go down hill; and then met, climbing on foot, on a bicycle, in a cart or carriage, one of those creatures \u2014 flowers of a fine day but unlike the flowers of the field, for each of them secretes something that is not to be found in another, with the result that we can never satisfy upon any of her fellows the desire which she has brought to birth in us \u2014 a farm-girl driving her cow or half-lying along a waggon, a shopkeeper\u2019s daughter taking the air, a fashionable young lady erect on the back seat of a landau, facing her parents. Certainly Bloch had been the means of opening a new era and had altered the value of life for me on the day when he had told me that the dreams which I had entertained on my solitary walks along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, when I hoped that some peasant girl might pass whom I could take in my arms, were not a mere fantasy which corresponded to nothing outside myself, but that all the girls one met, whether villagers or \u2018young ladies,\u2019 were alike ready and willing to give ear to such prayers. And even if I were fated, now that I was ill and did not go out by myself, never to be able to make love to them, I was happy all the same, like a child born in a prison or a hospital, who, having always supposed that the human organism was capable of digesting only dry bread and \u2018physic,\u2019 has learned suddenly that peaches, apricots and grapes are not simply part of the decoration of the country scene but delicious and easily assimilated food. Even if his gaoler or his nurse does not allow him to pluck those tempting fruits, still the world seems to him a better place and existence in it more clement. For a desire seems to us more attractive, we repose on it with more confidence, when we know that outside ourselves there is a reality which conforms to it, even if, for us, it is not to be realised. And we think with more joy of a life in which (on condition that we eliminate for a moment from our mind the tiny obstacle, accidental and special, which prevents us personally from doing so) we can imagine ourself to be assuaging that desire. As to the pretty girls who went past, from the day on which I had first known that their cheeks could be kissed, I had become curious about their souls. And the universe had appeared to me more interesting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s carriage moved fast. Scarcely had I time to see the girl who was coming in our direction; and yet \u2014 as the beauty of people is not like the beauty of things, as we feel that it is that of an unique creature, endowed with consciousness and free-will \u2014 as soon as her individuality, a soul still vague, a will unknown to me, presented a tiny picture of itself, enormously reduced but complete, in the depths of her indifferent eyes, at once, by a mysterious response of the pollen ready in me for the pistils that should receive it, I felt surging through me the embryo, as vague, as minute, of the desire not to let this girl pass without forcing her mind to become conscious of my person, without preventing her desires from wandering to some one else, without coming to fix myself in her dreams and to seize and occupy her heart. Meanwhile our carriage rolled away from her, the pretty girl was already left behind, and as she had \u2014 of me \u2014 none of those notions which constitute a person in one\u2019s mind, her eyes which had barely seen me had forgotten me already. Was it because I had caught but a fragmentary glimpse of her that I had found her so attractive? It may have been. In the first place, the impossibility of stopping when I came to her, the risk of not meeting her again another day, give at once to such a girl the same charm as a place derives from the illness or poverty that prevents us from visiting it, or the so unadventurous days through which we should otherwise have to live from the battle in which we shall doubtless fall. So that, if there were no such thing as habit, life must appear delightful to those of us who would at every moment be threatened with death \u2014 that is to say, to all mankind. Then, if our imagination is set going by the desire for what we may not possess, its flight is not limited by a reality completely perceived, in these casual encounters in which the charms of the passing stranger are generally in direct ratio to the swiftness of our passage. If only night is falling and the carriage is moving fast, whether in town or country, there is not a female torso, mutilated like an antique marble by the speed that tears us away and the dusk that drowns it, but aims at our heart, from every turning in the road, from the lighted interior of every shop, the arrows of Beauty, that Beauty of which we are sometimes tempted to ask ourselves whether it is, in this world, anything more than the complementary part that is added to a fragmentary and fugitive stranger by our imagination over-stimulated by regret\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had I been free to stop, to get down from the carriage and to speak to the girl whom we were passing, should I perhaps have been disillusioned by some fault in her complexion which from the carriage I had not distinguished? (After which every effort to penetrate into her life would have seemed suddenly impossible. For beauty is a sequence of hypotheses which ugliness cuts short when it bars the way that we could already see opening into the unknown.) Perhaps a single word which she might have uttered, a smile, would have furnished me with a key, a clue that I had not expected, to read the expression of her face, to interpret her bearing, which would at once have ceased to be of any interest. It is possible, for I have never in real life met any girls so desirable as on days when I was with some serious person from whom, despite the \u2014 myriad pretexts that I invented, I could not tear myself away: some years after that in which I went for the first time to Balbec, as I was driving through Paris with a friend of my father, and had caught sight of a woman walking quickly along the dark street, I felt that it was unreasonable to forfeit, for a purely conventional scruple, my share of happiness in what may very well be the only life there is, and jumping from the carriage without a word of apology I followed in quest of the stranger; lost her where two streets crossed; caught her up again in a third, and arrived at last, breathless, beneath a street lamp, face to face with old Mme. Verdurin whom I had been carefully avoiding for years, and who, in her delight and surprise, exclaimed: \u201cBut how very nice of you to have run all this way just to say how d\u2019ye do to me!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That year at Balbec, at the moments of such encounters, I would assure my grandmother and Mme. de Villeparisis that I had so severe a headache that the best thing for me would be to go home alone on foot. But they would never let me get out of the carriage. And I must add that pretty girl (far harder to find again than an historic building, for she was nameless and had the power of locomotion) to the collection of all those whom I promised myself that I would examine more closely at a later date. One of them, however, happened to pass more than once before my eyes in circumstances which allowed me to believe that I should be able to get to know her when I chose. This was a milk-girl who came from a farm with an additional supply of cream for the hotel. I fancied that she had recognised me also; and she did, in fact, look at me with an attentiveness which was perhaps due only to the surprise which my attentiveness caused her. And next day, a day on which I had been resting all morning, when Fran\u00e7oise came in about noon to draw my curtains, she handed me a letter which had been left for me downstairs. I knew no one at Balbec. I had no doubt that the letter was from the milk-girl. Alas, it was only from Bergotte who, as he happened to be passing, had tried to see me, but on hearing that I was asleep had scribbled a few charming lines for which the lift-boy had addressed an envelope which I had supposed to have been written by the milk-girl. I was bitterly disappointed, and the thought that it was more difficult, and more flattering to myself to get a letter from Bergotte did not in the least console me for this particular letter\u2019s not being from her. As for the girl, I never came across her again any more than I came across those whom I had seen only from Mme. de Ville-parisis\u2019s carriage. Seeing and then losing them all thus increased the state of agitation in which I was living, and I found a certain wisdom in the philosophers who recommend us to set a limit to our desires (if, that is, they refer to our desire for people, for that is the only kind that ends in anxiety, having for its object a being at once unknown and unconscious. To suppose that philosophy could refer to the desire for wealth would be too silly.). At the same time I was inclined to regard this wisdom as incomplete, for I said to myself that these encounters made me find even more beautiful a world which thus caused to grow along all the country roads flowers at once rare and common, fleeting treasures of the day, windfalls of the drive, of which the contingent circumstances that would never, perhaps, recur had alone prevented me from taking advantage, and which gave a new zest to life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But perhaps in hoping that, one day, with greater freedom, I should be able to find on other roads girls much the same, I was already beginning to falsify and corrupt what there is exclusively individual in the desire to live in the company of a woman whom one has found attractive, and by the mere fact that I admitted the possibility of making this desire grow artificially, I had implicitly acknowledged my allusion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The day on which Mme. de Villeparisis took us to Carqueville, where there was that church, covered in ivy, of which she had spoken to us, a church that, built upon rising ground, dominated both its village and the river that flowed beneath it, and had kept its own little bridge from the middle ages, my grandmother, thinking that I would like to be left alone to study the building at my leisure, suggested to her friend that they should go on and wait for me at the pastry-cook\u2019s, in the village square which was clearly visible from where we were and, in its mellow bloom in the sunshine, seemed like another part of a whole that was all mediaeval. It was arranged that I should join them there later. In the mass of verdure before which I was left standing I was obliged, if I was to discover the church, to make a mental effort which involved my grasping more intensely the idea \u2018Church\u2019; in fact, as happens to schoolboys who gather more fully the meaning of a sentence when they are made, by translating or by paraphrasing it, to divest it of the forms to which they are accustomed, this idea of \u2018Church,\u2019 which as a rule I scarcely needed when I stood beneath steeples that were recognisable in themselves, I was obliged perpetually to recall so as not to forget, here that the arch in this clump of ivy was that of a pointed window, there that the projection of the leaves was due to the swelling underneath of a capital. Then came a breath of wind, and sent a tremor through the mobile porch, which was overrun by eddies that shot and quivered like a flood of light; the pointed leaves opened one against another; and, shuddering, the arboreal front drew after it green pillars, undulant, caressed and fugitive\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I came away from the church I saw by the old bridge a cluster of girls from the village who, probably because it was Sunday, were standing about in their best clothes, rallying the young men who went past. Not so well dressed as the others, but seeming to enjoy some ascendancy over them \u2014 for she scarcely answered when they spoke to her \u2014 with a more serious and a more determined air, there was a tall one who, hoisted upon the parapet of the bridge with her feet hanging down, was holding on her lap a small vessel full of fish which she had presumably just been catching. She had a tanned complexion, gentle eyes but with a look of contempt for her surroundings, a small nose, delicately and attractively modelled. My eyes rested upon her skin; and my lips, had the need arisen, might have believed that they had followed my eyes. But it was not only to her body that I should have liked to attain, there was also her person, which abode within her, and with which there is but one form of contact, namely to attract its attention, but one sort of penetration, to awaken an idea in it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And this inner self of the charming fisher-girl seemed to be still closed to me, I was doubtful whether I had entered it, even after I had seen my own image furtively reflect itself in the twin mirrors of her gaze, following an index of refraction that was as unknown to me as if I had been placed in the field of vision of a deer. But just as it would not have sufficed that my lips should find pleasure in hers without giving pleasure to them also, so I should have wished that the idea of me which was to enter this creature, was to fasten itself in her, should attract to me not merely her attention but her admiration, her desire, and should compel her to keep me in her memory until the day when I should be able to meet her again. Meanwhile I could see, within a stone\u2019s-throw, the square in which Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s carriage must be waiting for me. I had not a moment to lose; and already I could feel that the girls were beginning to laugh at the sight of me thus held suspended before them. I had a five-franc piece in my pocket. I drew it out, and, before explaining to the girl the errand on which I proposed to send her, so as to have a better chance of her listening to me, I held the coin for a moment before her eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSince you seem to belong to the place,\u201d I said to her, \u201cI wonder if you would be so good as to take a message for me. I want you to go to a pastrycook\u2019s \u2014 which is apparently in a square, but I don\u2019t know where that is \u2014 where there is a carriage waiting for me. One moment! To make quite sure, will you ask if the carriage belongs to the Marquise de Villeparisis? But you can\u2019t miss it; it\u2019s a carriage and pair.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That was what I wished her to know, so that she should regard me as someone of importance. But when I had uttered the words \u2018Marquise\u2019 and \u2018carriage and pair,\u2019 suddenly I had a great sense of calm. I felt that the fisher-girl would remember me, and I felt vanishing, with my fear of not being able to meet her again, part also of my desire to meet her. It seemed to me that I had succeeded in touching her person with invisible lips, and that I had pleased her. And this assault and capture of her mind, this immaterial possession had taken from her part of her mystery, just as physical possession does\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We came down towards Hudimesnil; suddenly I was overwhelmed with that profound happiness which I had not often felt since Combray; happiness analogous to that which had been given me by \u2014 among other things \u2014 the steeples of Martinville. But this time it remained incomplete. I had just seen, standing a little way back from the steep ridge over which we were passing, three trees, probably marking the entrance to a shady avenue, which made a pattern at which I was looking now not for the first time; I could not succeed in reconstructing the place from which they had been, as it were, detached, but I felt that it had been familiar to me once; so that my mind having wavered between some distant year and the present moment, Balbec and its surroundings began to dissolve and I asked myself whether the whole of this drive were not a make-believe, Balbec a place to which I had never gone save in imagination, Mme. de Villeparisis a character in a story and the three old trees the reality which one recaptures on raising one\u2019s eyes from the book which one has been reading and which describes an environment into which one has come to believe that one has been bodily transported\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I looked at the three trees; I could see them plainly, but my mind felt that they were concealing something which it had not grasped, as when things are placed out of our reach, so that our fingers, stretched out at arm\u2019s-length, can only touch for a moment their outer surface, and can take hold of nothing. Then we rest for a little while before thrusting out our arm with refreshed vigour, and trying to reach an inch or two farther. But if my mind was thus to collect itself, to gather strength, I should have to be alone. What would I not have given to be able to escape as I used to do on those walks along the Guermantes way, when I detached myself from my parents! It seemed indeed that I ought to do so now. I recognised that kind of pleasure which requires, it is true, a certain effort on the part of the mind, but in comparison with which the attractions of the inertia which inclines us to renounce that pleasure seem very slight. That pleasure, the object of which I could but dimly feel, that pleasure which I must create for myself, I experienced only on rare occasions, but on each of these it seemed to me that the things which had happened in the interval were of but scant importance, and that in attaching myself to the reality of that pleasure alone I could at length begin to lead a new life. I laid my hand for a moment across my eyes, so as to be able to shut them without Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s noticing. I sat there, thinking of nothing, then with my thoughts collected, compressed and strengthened I sprang farther forward in the direction of the trees, or rather in that inverse direction at the end of which I could see them growing within myself. I felt again behind them the same object, known to me and yet vague, which I could not bring nearer. And yet all three of them, as the carriage moved on, I could see coming towards me. Where had I looked at them before? There was no place near Combray where an avenue opened off the road like that. The site which they recalled to me, there was no room for it either in the scenery of the place in Germany where I had gone one year with my grandmother to take the waters. Was I to suppose, then, that they came from years already so remote in my life that the landscape which accompanied them had been entirely obliterated from my memory, and that, like the pages which, with sudden emotion, we recognise in a book which we imagined that we had never read, they surged up by themselves out of the forgotten chapter of my earliest infancy? Were they not rather to be numbered among those dream landscapes, always the same, at least for me in whom their unfamiliar aspect was but the objectivation in my dreams of the effort that I had been making while awake either to penetrate the mystery of a place beneath the outward appearance of which I was dimly conscious of there being something more, as had so often happened to me on the Guermantes way, or to succeed in bringing mystery back to a place which I had longed to know and which, from the day on which I had come to know it, had seemed to me to be wholly superficial, like Balbec? Or were they but an image freshly extracted from a dream of the night before, but already so worn, so altered that it seemed to me to come from somewhere far more distant? Or had I indeed never seen them before; did they conceal beneath their surface, like the trees, like the tufts of grass that I had seen beside the Guermantes way, a meaning as obscure, as hard to grasp as is a distant past, so that, whereas they are pleading with me that I would master a new idea, I imagined that I had to identify something in my memory? Or again were they concealing no hidden thought, and was it simply my strained vision that made me see them double in time as one occasionally sees things double in space? I could not tell. And yet all the time they were coming towards me; perhaps some fabulous apparition, a ring of witches or of norns who would propound their oracles to me. I chose rather to believe that they were phantoms of the past, dear companions of my childhood, vanished friends who recalled our common memories. Like ghosts they seemed to be appealing to me to take them with me, to bring them back to life. In their simple, passionate gesticulation I could discern the helpless anguish of a beloved person who has lost the power of speech, and feels that he will never be able to say to us what he wishes to say and we can never guess. Presently, at a cross-roads, the carriage left them. It was bearing me away from what alone I believed to be true, what would have made me truly happy; it was like my life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I watched the trees gradually withdraw, waving their despairing arms, seeming to say to me: \u201cWhat you fail to learn from us to-day, you will never know. If you allow us to drop back into the hollow of this road from which we sought to raise ourselves up to you, a whole part of yourself which we were bringing to you will fall for ever into the abyss.\u201d And indeed if, in the course of time, I did discover the kind of pleasure and of disturbance which I had just been feeling once again, and if one evening \u2014 too late, but then for all time \u2014 I fastened myself to it, of those trees themselves I was never to know what they had been trying to give me nor where else I had seen them. And when, the road having forked and the carriage with it, I turned my back on them and ceased to see them, with Mme. de Villeparisis asking me what I was dreaming about, I was as wretched as though I had just lost a friend, had died myself, had broken faith with the dead or had denied my God\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was time to be thinking of home. Mme. de Villeparisis, who had a certain feeling for nature, colder than that of my grandmother but capable of recognising, even outside museums and noblemen\u2019s houses, the simple and majestic beauty of certain old and venerable things, told her coachman to take us back by the old Balbec road, a road little used but planted with old elm-trees which we thought quite admirable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once we had got to know this road, for a change we would return \u2014 that is, if we had not taken it on the outward journey \u2014 by another which ran through the woods of Chantereine and Canteloup. The invisibility of the numberless birds that took up one another\u2019s song close beside us in the trees gave me the same sense of being at rest that one has when one shuts one\u2019s eyes. Chained to my back-seat like Prometheus on his rock I listened to my Oceanides. And when it so happened that I caught a glimpse of one of those birds as it passed from one leaf to another, there was so little apparent connexion between it and the songs that I heard that I could not believe that I was beholding their cause in that little body, fluttering, startled and unseeing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This road was like many others of the same kind which are to be found in France, climbing on a fairly steep gradient to its summit and then gradually falling for the rest of the way. At the time, I found no great attraction in it, I was only glad to be going home. But it became for me later on a frequent source of joy by remaining in my memory as a lodestone to which all the similar roads that I was to take, on walks or drives or journeys, would at once attach themselves without breach of continuity and would be able, thanks to it, to communicate directly with my heart. For as soon as the carriage or the motor-car turned into one of these roads that seemed to be merely the continuation of the road along which I had driven with Mme. de Villeparisis, the matter to which I found my consciousness directly applying itself, as to the most recent event in my past, would be (all the intervening years being quietly obliterated) the impressions that I had had on those bright summer afternoons and evenings, driving round Balbec, when the leaves smelt good, a mist rose from the ground, and beyond the village close at hand one could see through the trees the sun setting as though it had been merely some place farther along the road, a forest place and distant, which we should not have time to reach that evening. Harmonised with what I was feeling now in another place, on a similar road, surrounded by all the accessory sensations of breathing deep draughts of air, of curiosity, indolence, appetite, lightness of heart which were common to them both, and excluding all others, these impressions would be reinforced, would take on the consistency of a particular type of pleasure, and almost of a setting of life which, as it happened, I rarely had the luck to-come across, but in which these awakened memories placed, amid the reality that my senses could perceive, no small part of a reality suggested, dreamed, unseizable, to give me, among those regions through which I was passing, more than an aesthetic feeling, a transient but exalted ambition to stay there and to live there always. How often since then, simply because I could smell green leaves, has not being seated on a backseat opposite Mme. de Villeparisis, meeting the Princesse de Luxembourg who waved a greeting to her from her own carriage, coming back to dinner at the Grand Hotel appeared to me as one of those indescribable happinesses which neither the present nor the future can restore to us, which we may taste once only in a lifetime\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often dusk would have fallen before we reached the hotel. Timidly I would quote to Mme. de Villeparisis, pointing to the moon in the sky, some memorable expression of Chateaubriand or Vigny or Victor Hugo: \u2018Shedding abroad that ancient secret of melancholy\u2019 or \u2018Weeping like Diana by the brink of her streams\u2019 or \u2018The shadows nuptial, solemn and august.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd so you think that good, do you?\u201d she would ask, \u201cinspired, as you call it. I must confess that I am always surprised to see people taking things seriously nowadays which the friends of those gentlemen, while doing ample justice to their merits, were the first to laugh at. People weren\u2019t so free then with the word \u2018inspired\u2019 as they are now, when if you say to a writer that he has mere talent he thinks you\u2019re insulting him. You quote me a fine passage from M. de Chateaubriand about moonlight. You shall see that I have my own reasons for being refractory. M. de Chateaubriand used constantly to come to see my father. He was quite a pleasant person when you were alone with him, because then he was simple and amusing, but the moment he had an audience he would begin to pose, and then he became absurd; when my father was in the room, he pretended that he had flung his resignation in the King\u2019s face, and that he had controlled the voting in the Conclave, forgetting that it was my father whom he had asked to beg the King to take him back, and that my father had heard him make the most idiotic forecasts of the Papal election. You ought to have heard M. de Blacas on that famous Conclave; he was a very different kind of man from M. de Chateaubriand. As to his fine phrases about the moon, they became part of our regular programme for entertaining our guests. Whenever there was any moonlight about the house, if there was anyone staying with us for the first time he would be told to take M. de Chateaubriand for a stroll after dinner. When they came in, my father would take his guest aside and say: \u2018Well, and was M. de Chateaubriand very eloquent?\u2019\u2014\u2018Oh, yes.\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s been talking about the moon?\u2019\u2014\u2018Yes, how did you know?\u2019\u2014\u2018One moment, didn\u2019t he say \u2014\u2014\u2019 and then my father would quote the passage. \u2018He did; but how in the world . . .?\u2019\u2014\u2018And he spoke to you of the moonlight on the Roman Campagna?\u2019\u2014\u2018But, my dear sir, you\u2019re a magician.\u2019 My father was no magician, but M. de Chateaubriand had the same little speech about the moon which he served up every time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the mention of Vigny she laughed: \u201cThe man who said: \u2018I am the Comte Alfred de Vigny!\u2019 One either is a Comte or one isn\u2019t; it is not of the slightest importance.\u201d And then perhaps she discovered that it was after all, of some slight importance, for she went on: \u201cFor one thing I am by no means sure that he was, and in any case he was of the humblest origin, that gentleman who speaks in his verses of his \u2018Esquire\u2019s crest.\u2019 In such charming taste, is it not, and so interesting to his readers! Like Musset, a plain Paris cit, who laid so much stress on \u2018The golden falcon that surmounts my helm.\u2019 As if you would ever hear a real gentleman say a thing like that! And yet Musset had some talent as a poet. But except Cinq-Mars I have never been able to read a thing by M. de Vigny. I get so bored that the book falls from my hands. M. Mole, who had all the cleverness and tact that were wanting in M. de Vigny, put him properly in his place when he welcomed him to the Academy. Do you mean to say you don\u2019t know the speech? It is a masterpiece of irony and impertinence.\u201d She found fault with Balzac, whom she was surprised to see her nephews admire, for having pretended to describe a society \u2018in which he was never received\u2019 and of which his descriptions were wildly improbable. As for Victor Hugo, she told us that M. de Bouillon, her father, who had friends among the young leaders of the Romantic movement, had been taken by some of them to the first performance of Hernani, but that he had been unable to sit through it, so ridiculous had he found the lines of that talented but extravagant writer who had acquired the title of \u2018Major Poet\u2019 only by virtue of having struck a bargain, and as a reward for the not disinterested indulgence that he shewed to the dangerous errors of the Socialists\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We had now come in sight of the hotel, with its lights, so hostile that first evening, on our arrival, now protecting and kind, speaking to us of home. And when the carriage drew up outside the door, the porter, the pages, the lift-boy, attentive, clumsy, vaguely uneasy at our lateness, were numbered, now that they had grown familiar, among those beings who change so many times in the course of our life, as we ourself change, but by whom, when they are for the time being the mirror of our habits, we find something attractive in the feeling that we are being faithfully reflected and in a friendly spirit. We prefer them to friends whom we have not seen for some time, for they contain more of what we actually are. Only the outside page, exposed to the sun all day, had been taken indoors for protection from the cold night air and swaddled in thick woollen garments which, combined with the orange effulgence of his locks and the curiously red bloom of his cheeks, made one, seeing him there through the glass front of the hall, think of a hot-house plant muffled up for protection from the frost. We got out of the carriage, with the help of a great many more servants than were required, but they were conscious of the importance of the scene and each felt obliged to take some part in it. I was always very hungry. And so, often, so as not to keep dinner waiting, I would not go upstairs first to the room which had succeeded in becoming so really mine that to catch sight of its long violet curtains and low bookcases was to find myself alone again with that self of which things, like people, gave me a reflected image; but we would all wait together in the hall until the head waiter came to tell us that our dinner was ready. And this gave us another opportunity of listening to Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut you must be tired of us by now,\u201d protested my grandmother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all! Why, I am delighted, what could be nicer?\u201d replied her friend with a winning smile, drawing out, almost intoning her words in a way that contrasted markedly with her customary simplicity of speech\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And indeed at such moments as this she was not natural, her mind reverted to her early training, to the aristocratic manner in which a great lady is supposed to shew common people that she is glad to see them, that she is not at all stiff. And her one and only failure in true politeness lay in this excess of politeness; which it was easy to identify as one of the professional \u2018wrinkles\u2019 of a lady of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, who, always seeing in her humbler friends the latent discontent that she must one day arouse in their bosoms, greedily seizes every opportunity en which she can possibly, in the ledger in which she keeps her social account with them, write down a credit balance which will allow her to enter presently on the opposite page the dinner or reception to which she will not invite them. And so, having long ago taken effect in her once and for all, and ignoring the fact that now both the circumstances and the people concerned were different, that in Paris she hoped to see us often come to her house, the spirit of her caste was urging Mme. de Villeparisis on with feverish ardour, and as if the time that was allowed her for being kind to us was limited, to multiply, while we were still at Balbec, her gifts of roses and melons, loans of books, drives in her carriage and verbal effusions. And for that reason, quite as much as the dazzling glories of the beach, the many-coloured flamboyance and subaqueous light of the rooms, as much even as the riding-lessons by which tradesmen\u2019s sons were deified like Alexander of Macedon, the daily kindnesses shewn us by Mme. de Villeparisis and also the unaccustomed, momentary, holiday ease with which my grandmother accepted them have remained in my memory as typical of life at a watering-place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGive them your cloaks to take upstairs.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother handed hers to the manager, and because he had been so nice to me I was distressed by this want of consideration, which seemed to pain him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI think you\u2019ve hurt his feelings,\u201d said the Marquise. \u201cHe probably fancies himself too great a gentleman to carry your wraps. I remember so well the Duc de Nemours, when I was still quite little, coming to see my father who was living then on the top floor of the Bouillon house, with a fat parcel under his arm of letters and newspapers. I can see the Prince now, in his blue coat, framed in our doorway, which had such pretty woodwork round it \u2014 I think it was Bagard made it \u2014 you know those fine laths that they used to cut, so supple that the joiner would twist them sometimes into little shells and flowers, like the ribbons round a nosegay. \u2018Here you are, Cyrus,\u2019 he said to my father, \u2018look what your porter\u2019s given me to bring you. He said to me: \u201cSince you\u2019re going up to see the Count, it\u2019s not worth my while climbing all those stairs; but take care you don\u2019t break the string.\u201d\u2019 Now that you have got rid of your things, why don\u2019t you sit down; look, sit in this seat,\u201d she said to my grandmother, taking her by the hand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, if you don\u2019t mind, not in that one! There is not room for two, and it\u2019s too big for me by myself; I shouldn\u2019t feel comfortable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou remind me, for it was exactly like this, of a seat that I had for many years until at last I couldn\u2019t keep it any longer because it had been given to my mother by the poor Duchesse de Praslin. My mother, though she was the simplest person in the world, really, had ideas that belonged to another generation, which even in those days I could scarcely understand; and at first she had not been at all willing to let herself be introduced to Mme. de Praslin, who had been plain Mlle. S\u00e9bastian!, while she, because she was a Duchess, felt that it was not for her to be introduced to my mother. And really, you know,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis went on, forgetting that she herself did not understand these fine shades of distinction, \u201ceven if she had just been Mme. de Choiseul, there was a good deal to be said for her claim. The Choiseuls are everything you could want; they spring from a sister of Louis the Fat; they were ruling princes down in Basigny. I admit that we beat them in marriages and in distinction, but the precedence is pretty much the same. This little difficulty gave rise to several amusing incidents, such as a luncheon party which was kept waiting a whole hour or more before one of these ladies could make up her mind to let herself be introduced to the other. In spite of which they became great friends, and she gave my mother a seat like that, in which people always refused to sit, just as you did, until one day my mother heard a carriage drive into the courtyard. She asked a young servant we had, who it was. \u2018The Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld, ma\u2019am.\u2019 \u2018Very well, say that I am at home.\u2019 A quarter of an hour passed; no one came. \u2018What about the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld?\u2019 my mother asked. \u2018Where is she?\u2019 \u2018She\u2019s on the stairs, ma\u2019am, getting her breath,\u2019 said the young servant, who had not been long up from the country, where my mother had the excellent habit of getting all her servants. Often she had seen them born. That\u2019s the only way to get really good ones. And they\u2019re the rarest of luxuries. And sure enough the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld had the greatest difficulty in getting upstairs, for she was an enormous woman, so enormous, indeed, that when she did come into the room my mother was quite at a loss for a moment to know where to put her. And then the seat that Mme. de Praslin had given her caught her eye. \u2018Won\u2019t you sit down?\u2019 she said, bringing it forward. And the Duchess filled it from side to side. She was quite a pleasant woman, for all her massiveness. \u2018She still creates an effect when she comes in,\u2019 one of our friends said once. \u2018She certainly creates an effect when she goes out,\u2019 said my mother, who was rather more free in her speech than would be thought proper nowadays. Even in Mme. de La Rochefoucauld\u2019s own drawing-room people weren\u2019t afraid to make fun of her to her face (at which she was always the first to laugh) over her ample proportions. \u2018But are you all alone?\u2019 my grandmother once asked M. de La Rochefoucauld, when she had come to pay a call on the Duchess, and being met at the door by him had not seen his wife who was at the other end of the room. \u2018Is Mme. de La Rochefoucauld not at home? I don\u2019t see her.\u2019\u2014\u2018How charming of you!\u2019 replied the Duke, who had about the worst judgment of any man I have ever known, but was not altogether lacking in humour.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After dinner, when I had retired upstairs with my grandmother, I said to her that the qualities which attracted us in Mme. de Villeparisis, her tact, her shrewdness, her discretion, her modesty in not referring to herself, were not, perhaps, of very great value since those who possessed them in the highest degree were simply people like Mole and Lom\u00e9nie, and that if the want of them can make our social relations unpleasant yet it did not prevent from becoming Chateaubriand, Vigny, Hugo, Balzac, a lot of foolish fellows who had no judgment, at whom it was easy to mock, like Bloch. . . . But at the name of Bloch, my grandmother cried out in protest. And she began to praise Mme. de Villeparisis. As we are told that it is the preservation of the species which guides our individual preferences in love, and, so that the child may be constituted in the most normal fashion, sends fat men in pursuit of lean women and vice versa, so in some dim way it was the requirements of my happiness threatened by my disordered nerves, by my morbid tendency to melancholy, to solitude, that made her allot the highest place to the qualities of balance and judgment, peculiar not only to Mme. de Villeparisis but to a society in which our ancestors saw blossom the minds of a Doudan, a M. de R\u00e9musat, not to mention a Beausergent, a Joubert, a S\u00e9vign\u00e9, a type of mind that invests life with more happiness, with greater dignity than the converse refinements which brought a Baudelaire, a Poe, a Verlaine, a Rimbaud to sufferings, to a disrepute such as my grandmother did not wish for her daughter\u2019s child. I interrupted her with a kiss and asked her if she had noticed some expression which Mme. de Villeparisis had used and which seemed to point to a woman who thought more of her noble birth than she was prepared to admit. In this way I used to submit my impressions of life to my grandmother, for I was never certain what degree of respect was due to anyone until she had informed me. Every evening I would come to her with the mental sketches that I had made during the day of all those non-existent people who were not her. Once I said to her: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be able to live without you.\u201d \u201cBut you mustn\u2019t speak like that;\u201d her voice was troubled. \u201cWe must harden our hearts more than that, you know. Or what would become of you if I went away on a journey? But I hope that you would be quite sensible and quite happy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI could manage to be sensible if you went away for a few days, but I should count the hours.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut if I were to go away for months . . . \u201d (at the bare suggestion of such a thing my heart was wrung) \u201c . . . for years . . . for . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We both remained silent. We dared not look one another in the face. And yet I was suffering more keenly from her anguish than from my own. And so I walked across to the window, and said to her, with a studied clearness of tone but with averted eyes:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know what a creature of habit I am. For the first few days after I have been parted from the people I love best, I am wretched. But though I go on loving them just as much, I grow used to their absence; life becomes calm, bearable, pleasant; I could stand being parted from them for months, for years . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was obliged to stop, and looked straight out of the window. My grandmother went out of the room for something. But next day I began to talk to her about philosophy, and, speaking in a tone of complete indifference, but at the same time taking care that my grandmother should pay attention to what I was saying, I remarked what a curious thing it was that, according to the latest scientific discoveries, the materialist position appeared to be crumbling, and the most likely thing to be, once again, the survival of the soul and reunion in a life everlasting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis gave us warning that presently she would not be able to see so much of us. A young nephew who was preparing for Sau-mur, and was meanwhile stationed in the neighbourhood, at Donci\u00e8res, was coming to spend a few weeks\u2019 furlough with her, and she would be devoting most of her time to him. In the course of our drives together she had boasted to us of his extreme cleverness, and above all of his goodness of heart; already I was imagining that he would have an instinctive feeling for me, that I was to be his best friend; and when, before his arrival, his aunt gave my grandmother to understand that he had unfortunately fallen into the clutches of an appalling woman with whom he was quite infatuated and who would never let him go, since I believed that that sort of love was doomed to end in mental aberration, crime and suicide, thinking how short the time was that was set apart for our friendship, already so great in my heart, although I had not yet set eyes on him, I wept for that friendship and for the misfortunes that were in store for it, as we weep for a person whom we love when some one has just told us that he is seriously ill and that his days are numbered\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One afternoon of scorching heat I was in the dining-room of the hotel, which they had plunged in semi-darkness, to shield it from the glare, by drawing the curtains which the sun gilded, while through the gaps between them I caught flashing blue glimpses of the sea, when along the central gangway leading inland from the beach to the high road I saw, tall, slender, his head held proudly erect upon a springing neck, a young man go past with searching eyes, whose skin was as fair and whose hair as golden as if they had absorbed all the rays of the%un. Dressed in a clinging, almost white material such as I could never have believed that any man would have the audacity to wear, the thinness of which suggested no less vividly than the coolness of the dining-room the heat and brightness of the glorious day outside, he was walking fast. His eyes, from one of which a monocle kept dropping, were of the colour of the sea. Everyone looked at him with interest as he passed, knowing that this young Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray was famed for the smartness of his clothes. All the newspapers had described the suit in which he had recently acted as second to the young Duc d\u2019Uz\u00e8s in a duel. One felt that this so special quality of his hair, his eyes, his skin, his figure, which would have marked him out in a crowd like a precious vein of opal, azure-shot and luminous, embedded in a mass of coarser substance, must correspond to a life different from that led by other men. So that when, before the attachment which Mme. de Villeparisis had been deploring, the prettiest women in society had disputed the possession of him, his presence, at a watering-place for instance, in the company of the beauty of the season to whom he was paying court, not only made her conspicuous, but attracted every eye fully as much to himself. Because of his \u2018tone,\u2019 of his impertinence befitting a young \u2018lion,\u2019 and especially of his astonishing good looks, some people even thought him effeminate, though without attaching any stigma, for everyone knew how manly he was and that he was a passionate \u2018womaniser.\u2019 This was Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s nephew of whom she had spoken to us. I was overcome with joy at the thought that I was going to know him and to see him for several weeks on end, and confident that he would bestow on me all his affection. He strode rapidly across the hotel, seeming to be in pursuit of his monocle, which kept darting away in front of him like a butterfly. He was coming from the beach, and the sea which filled the lower half of the glass front of the hall gave him a background against which he was drawn at full length, as in certain portraits whose painters attempt, without in anyway falsifying the most accurate observation of contemporary life, but by choosing for their sitter appropriate surroundings, a polo ground, golf links, a racecourse, the bridge of a yacht, to furnish a modern equivalent of those canvases on which the old masters used to present the human figure in the foreground of a landscape. A carriage and pair was waiting for him at the door; and, while his monocle resumed its gambollings in the air of the sunlit street, with the elegance and mastery which a great pianist contrives to display in the simplest piece of execution, where it has not appeared possible that he could shew himself superior to a performer of the second class, Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s nephew, taking the reins that were handed him by the groom, jumped on to the box seat by his side and, while he opened a letter which the manager of the hotel sent out after him, made his horses start\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What a disappointment was mine on the days that followed, when, each time that I met him outside or in the hotel \u2014 his head erect, perpetually balancing the movements of his limbs round the fugitive and dancing monocle which seemed to be their centre of gravity \u2014 I was forced to admit that he had evidently no desire to make our acquaintance, and saw that he did not bow to us although he must have known that we were friends of his aunt. And calling to mind the friendliness that Mme. de Villeparisis, and before her M. de Norpois, had shewn me, I thought that perhaps they were only of a bogus nobility, and that there might be a secret section in the laws that govern the aristocracy which allowed women, perhaps, and certain diplomats to discard, in their relations with plebeians, for a reason which was beyond me, the stiffness which must, on the other hand, be pitilessly maintained by a young Marquis. My intelligence might have told me the opposite. But the characteristic feature of the silly phase through which I was passing \u2014 a phase by no means irresponsive, indeed highly fertile \u2014 is that we do not consult our intelligence and that the most trivial attributes of other people seem to us then to form an inseparable part of their personality. In a world thronged with monsters and with gods, we are barely conscious of tranquillity. There is hardly one of the actions which we performed in that phase which we would not give anything, in later life, to be able to erase from our memory. Whereas what we ought to regret is that we no longer possess the spontaneity which made us perform them. In later life we look at things in a more practical way, in full conformity with the rest of society, but youth was the only time in which we learned anything\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This insolence which I surmised in M. de Saint-Loup, and all that it implied of ingrained severity, received confirmation from his attitude whenever he passed us, his body as inflexibly erect, his head always held as high, his gaze as impassive, or rather, I should say, as implacable, devoid of that vague respect which one has for the rights of other people, even if they do not know one\u2019s aunt, one example of which was that I did not look in quite the same way at an old lady as at a gas lamp. These frigid manners were as far removed from the charming letters which, but a few days since, I had still been imagining him as writing to tell me of his regard for myself, as is removed from the enthusiasm of the Chamber and of the populace which he has been picturing himself as rousing by an imperishable speech, the humble, dull, obscure position of the dreamer who, after pondering it thus by himself, for himself, aloud, finds himself, once the imaginary applause has died away, just the same Tom, Dick or Harry as before. When Mme. de Villeparisis, doubtless in an attempt to counteract the bad impression that had been made on us by an exterior indicative of an arrogant and evil nature, spoke to us again of the inexhaustible goodness of her great-nephew (he was the son of one of her nieces, and a little older than myself), I marvelled how the world, with an utter disregard of truth, ascribes tenderness of heart to people whose hearts are in reality so hard and dry, provided only that they behave with common courtesy to the brilliant members of their own sets. Mme. de Villeparisis herself confirmed, though indirectly, my diagnosis, which was already a conviction, of the essential points of her nephew\u2019s character one day when I met them both coming along a path so narrow that there was nothing for it but to introduce me to him. He seemed not to hear that a person\u2019s name was being repeated to him, not a muscle of his face moved; his eyes, in which there shone not the faintest gleam of human sympathy, shewed merely in the insensibility, in the inanity of their gaze an exaggeration failing which there would have been nothing to distinguish them from lifeless mirrors. Then fastening on me those hard eyes, as though he wished to make sure of me before returning my salute, by an abrupt release which seemed to be due rather to a reflex action of his muscles than to an exercise of will, keeping between himself and me the greatest possible interval, he stretched his arm out to its full extension and, at the end of it, offered me his hand. I supposed that it must mean, at the very least, a duel when, next day, he sent me his card. But he spoke to me only of literature, declared after a long talk that he would like immensely to spend several hours with me every day. He had not only, in this encounter, given proof of an ardent zest for the things of the spirit, he had shewn a regard for myself which was little in keeping with his greeting of me the day before. After I had seen him repeat the same process whenever anyone was introduced to him, I realised that it was simply a social usage peculiar to his branch of the family, to which his mother, who had seen to it that he should be perfectly brought up, had moulded his limbs; he went through those motions without thinking, any more than he thought about his beautiful clothes or hair; they were a thing devoid of the moral significance which I had at first ascribed to them, a thing purely acquired like that other habit that he had of at once demanding an introduction to the family of anyone whom he knew, which had become so instinctive in him that, seeing me again the day after our talk, he fell upon me and without asking how I did begged me to make him known to my grandmother, who was with me, with the same feverish haste as if the request had been due to some instinct of self-preservation, like the act of warding off a blow, or of shutting one\u2019s eyes to avoid a stream of boiling water, without which precautions it would have been dangerous to stay where one was a moment longer\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first rites of exorcism once performed, as a wicked fairy discards her outer form and endures all the most enchanting graces, I saw this disdainful creature become the most friendly, the most considerate young man that I had ever met. \u201cGood,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cI\u2019ve been mistaken about him once already; I was taken in by a mirage; but I have corrected the first only to fall into a second, for he must be a great gentleman who has grown sick of his nobility and is trying to hide it.\u201d As a matter of fact it was not long before all the exquisite breeding, all the friendliness of Saint-Loup were indeed to let me see another creature but one very different from what I had suspected\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This young man who had the air of a scornful, sporting aristocrat had in fact no respect, no interest save for and in the things of the spirit, and especially those modern manifestations of literature and art which seemed so ridiculous to his aunt; he was imbued, moreover, with what she called \u2018Socialistic spoutings,\u2019 was filled with the most profound contempt for his caste and spent long hours in the study of Nietzsche and Proudhon. He was one of those intellectuals, quick to admire what is good, who shut themselves up in a book, and are interested only in pure thought. Indeed in Saint-Loup the expression of this highly abstract tendency, which removed him so far from my customary preoccupations, while it seemed to me touching, also annoyed me not a little. I may say that when I realised properly who had been his father, on days when I had been reading memoirs rich in anecdotes of that famous Comte de Marsantes, in whom were embodied the special graces of a generation already remote, the mind full of speculation \u2014 anxious to obtain fuller details of the life that M. de Marsantes had led, it used to infuriate me that Robert de Saint-Loup, instead of being content to be the son of his father, instead of being able to guide me through the old-fashioned romance of what had been that father\u2019s existence, had trained himself to enjoy Nietzsche and Proudhon. His father would not have shared my regret. He had been himself a man of brains, who had transcended the narrow confines of his life as a man of the world. He had hardly had time to know his son, but had hoped that his son would prove a better man than himself. And I really believe that, unlike the rest of the family, he would have admired his son, would have rejoiced at his abandoning what had been his own small diversions for austere meditations, and without saying a word, in his modesty as a great gentleman endowed with brains, he would have read in secret his son\u2019s favourite authors in order to appreciate how far Robert was superior to himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was, however, this rather painful consideration: that if M. de Marsantes, with his extremely open mind, would have appreciated a son so different from himself, Robert de Saint-Loup, because he was one of those who believe that merit is attached only to certain forms of art and life, had an affectionate but slightly contemptuous memory of a father who had spent all his time hunting and racing, who yawned at Wagner and raved over Offenbach. Saint-Loup had not the intelligence to see that intellectual worth has nothing to do with adhesion to any one aesthetic formula, and had for the intellectuality of M. de Marsantes much the same sort of scorn as might have been felt for Boieldieu or Labiche by a son of Boieldieu or Labiche who had become adepts in the most symbolic literature and the most complex music. \u201cI scarcely knew my father,\u201d he used to say. \u201cHe seems to have been a charming person. His tragedy was the deplorable age in which he lived. To have been born in the Faubourg Saint-Germain and to have to live in the days of La Belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne would be enough to wreck any existence. Perhaps if he\u2019d been some little shopkeeper mad about the Ring he\u2019d have turned out quite different. Indeed they tell me that he was fond of literature. But that can never be proved, because literature to him meant such utterly god-forsaken books.\u201d And in my own case, if I found Saint-Loup a trifle earnest, he could not understand why I was not more earnest still. Never judging anything except by the weight of the intelligence that it contained, never perceiving the magic appeal to the imagination that I found in things which he condemned as frivolous, he was astonished that I\u2014 I, to whom he imagined himself to be so utterly inferior \u2014 could take any interest in them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0>From the first Saint-Loup made a conquest of my grandmother, not only by the incessant acts of kindness which he went out of his way to shew to us both, but by the naturalness which he put into them as into everything. For naturalness \u2014 doubtless because through the artifice of man it allows a feeling of nature to permeate \u2014 was the quality which my grandmother preferred to all others, whether in gardens, where she did not like there to be, as there had been in our Combray garden, too formal borders, or at table, where she detested those dressed-up dishes in which you could hardly detect the foodstuffs that had gone to make them, or in piano-playing, which she did not like to be too finicking, too laboured, having indeed had a special weakness for the discords, the wrong notes of Rubinstein. This naturalness she found and enjoyed even in the clothes that Saint-Loup wore, of a pliant elegance, with nothing swagger, nothing formal about them, no stiffness or starch. She appreciated this rich young man still more highly for the free and careless way that he had of living in luxury without \u2018smelling of money,\u2019 without giving himself airs; she even discovered the charm of this naturalness in the incapacity which Saint-Loup had kept, though as a rule it is outgrown with childhood, at the same time as certain physiological peculiarities of that period, for preventing his face from at once reflecting every emotion. Something, for instance, that he wanted to have but had not expected, were it no more than a compliment, reacted in him in a burst of pleasure so quick, so burning, so volatile, so expansive that it was impossible for him to contain and to conceal it; a grin of delight seized irresistible hold of his face; the too delicate skin of his cheeks allowed a vivid glow to shine through them, his eyes sparkled with confusion and joy; and my grandmother was infinitely touched by this charming show of innocence and frankness, which, incidentally, in Saint-Loup \u2014 at any rate at the period of our first friendship \u2014 was not misleading. But I have known another person, and there are many such, in whom the physiological sincerity of that fleeting blush in no way excluded moral duplicity; as often as not it proves nothing more than the vivacity with which pleasure is felt \u2014 so that it disarms them and they are forced publicly to confess it \u2014 by natures capable of the vilest treachery. But where my grandmother did really adore Saint-Loup\u2019s naturalness was in his way of admitting, without any evasion, his affection for me, to give expression to which he found words than which she herself, she told me, could not have thought of any more appropriate, more truly loving, words to which \u2018S\u00e9vign\u00e9 and Beausergent\u2019 might have set their signatures. He was not afraid to make fun of my weaknesses \u2014 which he had discerned with an acuteness that made her smile \u2014 but as she herself would have done, lovingly, at the same time extolling my good qualities with a warmth, an impulsive freedom that shewed no sign of the reserve, the coldness by means of which young men of his age are apt to suppose that they give themselves importance. And he shewed in forestalling every discomfort, however slight, in covering my legs if the day had turned cold without my noticing it, in arranging (without telling me) to stay later with me in the evening if he thought that I was depressed or felt unwell, a vigilance which, from the point of view of my health, for which a more hardening discipline would perhaps have been better, my grandmother found almost excessive, though as a proof of his affection for myself she was deeply touched by it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was promptly settled between us that he and I were to be great friends for ever, and he would say \u2018our friendship\u2019 as though he were speaking of some important and delightful thing which had an existence independent of ourselves, and which he soon called \u2014 not counting his love for his mistress \u2014 the great joy of his life. These words made me rather uncomfortable and I was at a loss for an answer, for I did not feel when I was with him and talked to him \u2014 and no doubt it would have been the same with everyone else \u2014 any of that happiness which it was, on the other hand, possible for me to experience when I was by myself. For alone, at times, I felt surging from the depths of my being one or other of those impressions which gave me a delicious sense of comfort. But as soon as I was with some one else, when I began to talk to a friend, my mind at once \u2018turned about,\u2019 it was towards the listener and not myself that it directed its thoughts, and when they followed this outward course they brought me no pleasure. Once I had left Saint-Loup, I managed, with the help of words, to put more or less in order the confused minutes that I had spent with him; I told myself that I had a good friend, that a good friend was a rare thing, and I tasted, when I felt myself surrounded by \u2018goods\u2019 that were difficult to acquire, what was precisely the opposite of the pleasure that was natural to me, the opposite of the pleasure of having extracted from myself and brought to light something that was hidden in my inner darkness. If I had spent two or three hours in conversation with Saint-Loup, and he had expressed his admiration of what I had said to him, I felt a sort of remorse, or regret, or weariness at not having been left alone and ready, at last, to begin my work. But I told myself that one is not given intelligence for one\u2019s own benefit only, that the greatest of men have longed for appreciation, that I could not regard as wasted hours in which I had built up an exalted idea of myself in the mind of my friend; I had no difficulty in persuading myself that I ought to be happy in consequence, and I hoped all the more anxiously that this happiness might never be taken from me simply because I had not yet been conscious of it. We fear more than the loss of everything else the disappearance of the \u2018goods\u2019 that have remained beyond our reach, because our heart has not taken possession of them. I felt that I was capable of exemplifying the virtues of friendship better than most people (because I should always place the good of my friends before those personal interests to which other people were devoted but which did not count for me), but not of finding happiness in a feeling which, instead of multiplying the differences that there were between my nature and those of other people \u2014 as there are among all of us \u2014 would cancel them. At the same time my mind was distinguishing in Saint-Loup a personality more collective than his own, that of the \u2018noble\u2019; which like an indwelling spirit moved his limbs, ordered his gestures and his actions; then, at such moments, although in his company, I was as much alone as I should have been gazing at a landscape the harmony of which I could understand. He was no more then than an object the properties of which, in my musing contemplations, I sought to explore. The perpetual discovery in him of this pre-existent, this aeonial creature, this aristocrat who was just what Robert aspired not to be, gave me a keen delight, but one that was intellectual and not social. In the moral and physical agility which gave so much grace to his kindnesses, in the ease with which he offered my grandmother his carriage and made her get into it, in the alacrity with which he sprang from the box, when he was afraid that I might be cold, to spread his own cloak over my shoulders, I felt not only the inherited litheness of the mighty hunters who had been for generations the ancestors of this young man who made no pretence save to intellectuality, their scorn of wealth which, subsisting in him side by side with his enjoyment of it simply because it enabled him to entertain his friends more lavishly, made him so carelessly shower his riches at their feet; I felt in him especially the certainty or the illusion in the minds of those great lords of being \u2018better than other people,\u2019 thanks to which they had not been able to hand down to Saint-Loup that anxiety to shew that one is \u2018just as good that dread of seeming inferior, of which he was indeed wholly unconscious, but which mars with so much ugliness, so much awkwardness, the most sincere overtures of a plebeian. Sometimes I found fault with myself for thus taking pleasure in my friend as in a work of art, that is to say in regarding the play of all the parts of his being as harmoniously ordered by a general idea from which they depended but which he did not know, so that it added nothing to his own good qualities, to that personal value, intellectual and moral, to which he attached so high a price\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet that idea was to a certain extent their determining cause. It was because he was a gentleman that that mental activity, those socialist aspirations, which made him seek the company of young students, arrogant and ill-dressed, connoted in him something really pure and disinterested which was not to be found in them. Looking upon himself as the heir of an ignorant and selfish caste, he was sincerely anxious that they should forgive in him that aristocratic origin which they, on the contrary, found irresistibly attractive and on account of which they sought to know him, though with a show of coldness and indeed of insolence towards him. He was thus led to make advances to people from whom my parents, faithful to the sociological theories of Combray, would have been stupefied at his not turning away in disgust. One day when we were sitting on the sands, Saint-Loup and I, we heard issuing from a canvas tent against which we were leaning a torrent of imprecation against the swarm of Israelites that infested Balbec. \u201cYou can\u2019t go a yard without meeting them,\u201d said the voice. \u201cI am not in principle irremediably hostile to the Jewish nation, but here there is a plethora of them. You hear nothing but, \u2018I thay, Apraham, I\u2019ve chust theen Chacop.\u2019 You would think you were in the Rue d\u2019Abou-kir.\u201d The man who thus inveighed against Israel emerged at last from the tent; we raised our eyes to behold this anti-Semite. It was my old friend Bloch. Saint-Loup at once begged me to remind him that they had met before the Board of Examiners, when Bloch had carried off the prize of honour, and since then at a popular university course\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the most I may have smiled now and then, to discover in Robert the marks of his Jesuit schooling, in the awkwardness which the fear of hurting people\u2019s feelings at once created in him whenever one of his intellectual friends made a social error, did something silly to which Saint-Loup himself attached no importance but felt that the other would have blushed if anybody had noticed it. And it was Robert who used to blush as though it had been he that was to blame, for instance on the day when Bloch, after promising to come and see him at the hotel, went on:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAs I cannot endure to be kept waiting among all the false splendour of these great caravanserais, and the Hungarian band would make me ill, you must tell the \u2018lighft-boy\u2019 to make them shut up, and to let you know at once.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Personally, I was not particularly anxious that Bloch should come to the hotel. He was at Balbec not by himself, unfortunately, but with his sisters, and they in turn had innumerable relatives and friends staying there. Now this Jewish colony was more picturesque than pleasant. Balbec was in this respect like such countries as Russia or Rumania, where the geography books teach us that the Israelite population does not enjoy anything approaching the same esteem and has not reached the same stage of assimilation as, for instance, in Paris. Always together, with no blend of any other element, when the cousins and uncles of Bloch or their coreligionists male or female repaired to the Casino, the ladies to dance, the gentlemen branching off towards the baccarat-tables, they formed a solid troop, homogeneous within itself, and utterly dissimilar to the people who watched them go past and found them there again every year without ever exchanging a word or a sign with them, whether these were on the Cambremers\u2019 list, or the presiding magistrate\u2019s little group, professional or \u2018business\u2019 people, or even simple corn-chandlers from Paris, whose daughters, handsome, proud, derisive and French as the statues at Rheims, would not care to mix with that horde of ill-bred tomboys, who carried their zeal for \u2018seaside fashions\u2019 so far as to be always apparently on their way home from shrimping or out to dance the tango. As for the men, despite the brilliance of their dinner-jackets and patent-leather shoes, the exaggeration of their type made one think of what people call the \u2018intelligent research\u2019 of painters who, having to illustrate the Gospels or the Arabian Nights, consider the country in which the scenes are laid, and give to Saint Peter or to Ali-Baba the identical features of the heaviest \u2018punter\u2019 at the Balbec tables. Bloch introduced his sisters, who, though he silenced their chatter with the utmost rudeness, screamed with laughter at the mildest sallies of this brother, their blindly worshipped idol. So that it is probable that this set of people contained, like every other, perhaps more than any other, plenty of attractions, merits and virtues. But in order to experience these, one had first to penetrate its enclosure. Now it was not popular; it could feel this; it saw in its unpopularity the mark of an anti-semitism to which it presented a bold front in a compact and closed phalanx into which, as it happened, no one ever dreamed of trying to make his way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At his use of the word \u2018lighft\u2019 I had all the less reason to be surprised in that, a few days before, Bloch having asked me why I had come to Balbec (although it seemed to him perfectly natural that he himself should be there) and whether it had been \u201cin the hope of making grand friends,\u201d when I had explained to him that this visit was a fulfilment of one of my earliest longings, though one not so deep as my longing to see Venice, he had replied: \u201cYes, of course, to sip iced drinks with the pretty ladies, while you pretend to be reading the Stones of Venighce, by Lord John Ruskin, a dreary shaver, in fact one of the most garrulous old barbers that you could find.\u201d So that Bloch evidently thought that in England not only were all the inhabitants of the male sex called \u2018Lord,\u2019 but the letter \u2018i\u2019 was invariably pronounced \u2018igh.\u2019 As for Saint-Loup, this mistake in pronunciation seemed to him all the less serious inasmuch as he saw in it pre-eminently a want of those almost \u2018society\u2019 notions which my new friend despised as fully as he was versed in them. But the fear lest Bloch, discovering one day that one says \u2018Venice\u2019 and that Ruskin was not a lord, should retrospectively imagine that Robert had been laughing at him, made the latter feel as guilty as if he had been found wanting in the indulgence with which, as we have seen, he overflowed, so that the blush which would no doubt one day dye the cheek of Bloch on the discovery of his error, Robert already, by anticipation and reflex action, could feel mounting to his own. For he fully believed that Bloch attached more importance than he to this mistake. Which Bloch proved to be true some time later, when he heard me pronounce the word \u2018lift,\u2019 by breaking in with:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, you say \u2018lift,\u2019 do you?\u201d And then, in a dry and lofty tone: \u201cNot that it is of the slightest importance.\u201d A phrase that is like a reflex action of the body, the same in all men whose self-esteem is great, in the gravest circumstances as well as in the most trivial, betraying there as clearly as on this occasion how important the thing in question seems to him who declares that it is of no importance; a tragic phrase at times, the first to escape (and then how heart-breaking) the lips of every man at all proud from whom we have just taken the last hope to which he still clung by refusing to do him a service. \u201cOh, well, it\u2019s not of the slightest importance; I shall make some other arrangement:\u201d the other arrangement which it is not of the slightest importance that he should be driven to adopt being often suicide\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from this, Bloch made me the prettiest speeches. He was certainly anxious to be on the best of terms with me. And yet he asked me: \u201cIs it because you\u2019ve taken a fancy to raise yourself to the peerage that you run after de Saint-Loup-en-Bray? You must be going through a fine crisis of snobbery. Tell me, are you a snob? I think so, what?\u201d Not that his desire to be friendly had suddenly changed. But what is called, in not too correct language, \u2018ill breeding\u2019 was his defect, and therefore the defect which he was bound to overlook, all the more that by which he did not believe that other people could be shocked. In the human race the frequency of the virtues that are identical in us all is not more wonderful than the multiplicity of the defects that are peculiar to each one of us. Undoubtedly, it is not common sense that is \u201cthe commonest thing in the world\u201d; but human kindness. In the most distant, the most desolate ends of the earth, we marvel to see it blossom of its own accord, as in a remote valley a poppy like the poppies in the world beyond, poppies which it has never seen as it has never known aught but the wind that, now and again, stirring the folds of its scarlet cloak, disturbs its solitude. Even if this human kindness, paralysed by self-interest, is not exercised, it exists none the less, and whenever any inconstant egoist does not restrain its action, when, for example, he is reading a novel or a newspaper, it will bud, blossom, grow, even in the heart of him who, cold-blooded in real life, has retained a tender heart, as a lover of fiction, for the weak, the righteous and the persecuted. But the variety of our defects is no less remarkable than the similarity of our virtues. Each of us has his own, so much so that to continue loving him we are obliged not to take them into account but to ignore them and look only to the rest of his character. The most perfect person in the world has a certain defect which shocks us or makes us angry. One man is of rare intelligence, sees everything from an exalted angle, never speaks evil of anyone, but will pocket and forget letters of supreme importance which it was he himself who asked you to let him post for you, and will then miss a vital engagement without offering you any excuse, with a smile, because he prides himself upon never knowing the time. Another is so refined, so gentle, so delicate in his conduct that he never says anything about you before your face except what you are glad to hear; but you feel that he refrains from uttering, that he keeps buried in his heart, where they grow bitter, very different opinions, and the pleasure that he derives from seeing you is so dear to him that he will let you faint with exhaustion sooner than leave you to yourself. A third has more sincerity, but carries it so far that he feels bound to let you know, when you have pleaded the state of your health as an excuse for not having been to see him, that you were seen going to the theatre and were reported to be looking well, or else that he has not been able to profit entirely by the action which you have taken on his behalf, which, by the way, three other of his friends had already offered to take, so that he is only moderately indebted to you. In similar circumstances the previous friend would have pretended not to know that you had gone to the theatre, or that other people could have done him the same service. But this last friend feels himself obliged to repeat or to reveal to somebody the very thing that is most likely to give offence; is delighted with his own frankness and tells you, emphatically: \u201cI am like that.\u201d While others infuriate you by their exaggerated curiosity, or by a want of curiosity so absolute that you can speak to them of the most sensational happenings without their grasping what it is all about; and others again take months to answer you if your letter has been about something that concerns yourself and not them, or else, if they write that they are coming to ask you for something and you dare not leave the house for fear of missing them, do not appear, but leave you in suspense for weeks because, not having received from you the answer which their letter did not in the least \u2018expect,\u2019 they have concluded that you must be cross with them. And others, considering their own wishes and not yours, talk to you without letting you get a word in if they are in good spirits and want to see you, however urgent the work you may have in hand, but if they feel exhausted by the weather or out of humour, you cannot get a word out of them, they meet your efforts with an inert languor and no more take the trouble to reply, even in monosyllables, to what you say to them than if they had not heard you. Each of our friends has his defects so markedly that to continue to love him we are obliged to seek consolation for those defects \u2014 in the thought of his talent, his goodness, his affection for ourself \u2014 or rather to leave them out of account, and for that we need to display all our good will. Unfortunately our obliging obstinacy in refusing to see the defect in our friend is surpassed by the obstinacy with which he persists in that defect, from his own blindness to it or the blindness that he attributes to other people. For he does not notice it himself, or imagines that it is not noticed. Since the risk of giving offence arises principally from the difficulty of appreciating what does and what does not pass unperceived, we ought, at least, from prudence, never to speak of ourselves, because that is a subject on which we may be sure that other people\u2019s views are never in accordance with our own. If we find as many surprises as on visiting a house of plain exterior which inside is full of hidden treasures, torture-chambers, skeletons, when we discover the true lives of other people, the real beneath the apparent universe, we are no less surprised if, in place of the image that we have made of ourself with the help of all the things that people have said to us, we learn from the terms in which they speak of us in our absence what an entirely different image they have been carrying in their own minds of us and of our life. So that whenever we have spoken about ourselves, we may be sure that our inoffensive and prudent words, listened to with apparent politeness and hypocritical approbation, have given rise afterwards to the most exasperated or the most mirthful, but in either case the least favourable, criticism. The least risk that we run is that of irritating people by the disproportion that there is between our idea of ourselves and the words that we use, a disproportion which as a rule makes people\u2019s talk about themselves as ludicrous as the performances of those self-styled music-lovers who when they feel the need to hum a favourite melody compensate for the inadequacy of their inarticulate murmurings by a strenuous mimicry and a look of admiration which is hardly justified by all that they let us hear. And to the bad habit of speaking about oneself and one\u2019s defects there must be added, as part of the same thing, that habit of denouncing in other people defects precisely analogous to one\u2019s own. For it is always of those defects that people speak, as though it were a way of speaking about oneself, indirectly, which added to the pleasure of absolution that of confession. Besides it seems that our attention, always attracted by what is characteristic of ourselves, notices that more than anything else in other people. One short-sighted man says of another: \u201cBut he can scarcely open his eyes!\u201d; a consumptive has his doubts as to the pulmonary integrity of the most robust; an unwashed man speaks only of the baths that other people do not take; an evil-smelling man insists that other people smell; a cuckold sees cuckolds everywhere, a light woman light women, a snob snobs. Then, too, every vice, like every profession, requires and trains a special knowledge which we are never loath to display. The invert detects and denounces inverts; the tailor asked out to dine, before he has begun to talk to you, has passed judgment on the cloth of your coat, which his fingers are itching to feel, and if after a few words of conversation you were to ask a dentist what he really thought of you, he would tell you how many of your teeth wanted filling. To him nothing appears more important, nor more absurd to you who have noticed his own. And it is not only when we speak of ourselves that we imagine other people to be blind; we behave as though they were. On every one of us there is a special god in attendance who hides from him or promises him the concealment from other people of his defect, just as he stops the eyes and nostrils of people who do not wash to the streaks of dirt which they carry in their ears and the smell of sweat which emanates from their armpits, and assures them that they can with impunity carry both of these about a world that will notice nothing. And those who wear artificial pearls, or give them as presents, imagine that people will take them to be genuine. Bloch was ill-bred, neurotic, a snob, and, since he belonged to a family of little repute, had to support, as on the floor of ocean, the incalculable pressure that was imposed on him not only by the Christians upon the surface but by all the intervening layers of Jewish castes superior to his own, each of them crushing with its contempt the one that was immediately beneath it. To carve his way through to the open air by raising himself from Jewish family to Jewish family would have taken Bloch many thousands of years. It was better worth his while to seek an outlet in another direction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Bloch spoke to me of the crisis of snobbery through which I must be passing, and bade me confess that I was a snob, I might well have replied: \u201cIf I were, I should not be going about with you.\u201d I said merely that he was not being very polite. Then he tried to apologise, but in the way that is typical of the ill-bred man who is only too glad to hark back to whatever it was if he can find an opportunity to aggravate his offence. \u201cForgive me,\u201d he used now to plead, whenever we met, \u201cI have vexed you, tormented you; I have been wantonly mischievous. And yet \u2014 man in general and your friend in particular is so singular an animal \u2014 you cannot imagine the affection that I, I who tease you so cruelly, have for you. It carries me often, when I think of you, to tears.\u201d And he gave an audible sob\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What astonished me more in Bloch than his bad manners was to find how the quality of his conversation varied. This youth, so hard to please that of authors who were at the height of their fame he would say: \u201cHe\u2019s a gloomy idiot; he\u2019s a sheer imbecile,\u201d would every now and then tell, with immense gusto, stories that were simply not funny or would instance as a \u2018really remarkable person\u2019 some man who was completely insignificant. This double scale of measuring the wit, the worth, the interest of people continued to puzzle me until I was introduced to M. Bloch, senior\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had not supposed that we should ever be allowed to know him, for Bloch junior had spoken ill of me to Saint-Loup and of Saint-Loup to me. In particular, he had said to Robert that I was (always) a frightful snob. \u201cYes, really, he is overjoyed at knowing M. LLLLegrandin.\u201d This trick of isolating a word, was, in Bloch, a sign at once of irony and of learning. Saint-Loup, who had never heard the name of Legrandin, was bewildered. \u201cBut who is he?\u201d \u201cOh, he\u2019s a bit of all right, he is!\u201d Bloch laughed, thrusting his hands into his pockets as though for warmth, convinced that he was at that moment engaged in contemplation of the picturesque aspect of an extraordinary country gentleman compared to whom those of Barbey d\u2019Aurevilly were as nothing. He consoled himself for his inability to portray M. Legrandin by giving him a string of capital L\u2019s, smacking his lips over the name as over a wine from the farthest bin. But these subjective enjoyments remained hidden from other people. If he spoke ill of me to Saint-Loup he made up for it by speaking no less ill of Saint-Loup to me. We had each of us learned these slanders in detail, the next day, not that we repeated them to each other, a thing which would have seemed to us very wrong, but to Bloch appeared so natural and almost inevitable that in his natural anxiety, in the certainty moreover that he would be telling us only what each of us was bound sooner or later to know, he preferred to anticipate the disclosure and, taking Saint-Loup aside, admitted that he had spoken ill of him, on purpose, so that it might be repeated to him, swore to him \u201cby Zeus Kronion, binder of oaths\u201d that he loved him dearly, that he would lay down his life for him; and wiped away a tear. The same day, he contrived to see me alone, made his confession, declared that he had acted in my interest, because he felt that a certain kind of social intercourse was fatal to me and that I was \u2018worthy of better things.\u2019 Then, clasping me by the hand, with the sentimentality of a drunkard, albeit his drunkenness was purely nervous: \u201cBelieve me,\u201d he said, \u201cand may the black Ker seize me this instant and bear me across the portals of Hades, hateful to men, if yesterday, when I thought of you, of Combray, of my boundless affection for you, of afternoon hours in class which you do not even remember, I did not lie awake weeping all night long. Yes, all night long, I swear it, and alas, I know \u2014 for I know the human soul \u2014 you will not believe me.\u201d I did indeed \u2018not believe\u2019 him, and to his words which, I felt, he was making up on the spur of the moment, and expanding as he went on, his swearing \u2018by Ker\u2019 added no great weight, the Hellenic cult being in Bloch purely literary. Besides, whenever he began to grow sentimental and wished his hearer to grow sentimental over a falsehood, he would say: \u201cI swear it,\u201d more for the hysterical satisfaction of lying than to make people think that he was speaking the truth. I did not believe what he was saying, but I bore him no ill-will for that, for I had inherited from my mother and grandmother their incapacity for resentment even of far worse offenders, and their habit of never condemning anyone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides, he was not altogether a bad youth, this Bloch; he could be, and was at times quite charming. And now that the race of Combray, the race from which sprang creatures absolutely unspoiled like my grandmother and mother, seems almost extinct, as I have hardly any choice now save between honest brutes \u2014 insensible and loyal, in whom the mere sound of their voices shews at once that they take absolutely no interest in one\u2019s life \u2014 and another kind of men who so long as they are with one understand one, cherish one, grow sentimental even to tears, take \u2014 their revenge a few hours later by making some cruel joke at one\u2019s expense, but return to one, always just as comprehending, as charming, as closely assimilated, for the moment, to oneself, I think that it is of this latter sort that I prefer if not the moral worth at any rate the society\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou cannot imagine my grief when I think of you,\u201d Bloch went on. \u201cWhen you come to think of it, it is a rather Jewish side of my nature,\u201d he added ironically, contracting his pupils as though he had to prepare for the microscope an infinitesimal quantity of \u2018Jewish blood,\u2019 and as might (but never would) have said a great French noble who among his ancestors, all Christian, might nevertheless have included Samuel Bernard, or further still, the Blessed Virgin from whom, it is said, the Levy family claim descent, \u201ccoming out. I rather like,\u201d he continued, \u201cto find room among my feelings for the share (not that it is more than a very tiny share) which may be ascribed to my Jewish origin.\u201d He made this statement because it seemed to him at once clever and courageous to speak the truth about his race, a truth which at the same time he managed to water down to a remarkable extent, like misers who decide to pay their debts but have not the courage to pay more than half. This kind of deceit which consists in having the boldness to proclaim the truth, but only after mixing with it an ample measure of lies which falsify it, is commoner than people think, and even among those who do not habitually practise it certain crises in life, especially those in which love is at stake, give them an opportunity of taking to it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All these confidential diatribes by Bloch to Saint-Loup against me and to me against Saint-Loup ended in an invitation to dinner. I am by no means sure that he did not first make an attempt to secure Saint-Loup by himself. It would have been so like Bloch to do so that probably he did; but if so success did not crown his effort, for it was to myself and Saint-Loup that Bloch said one day: \u201cDear master, and you, O horseman beloved of Ares, de Saint-Loup-en-Bray, tamer of horses, since I have encountered you by the shore of Amphitrite, resounding with foam, hard by the tents of the swift-shipped M\u00e9niers, will both of you come to dinner any day this week with my illustrious sire, of blameless heart?\u201d He proffered this invitation because he desired to attach himself more closely to Saint-Loup who would, he hoped, secure him the right of entry into aristocratic circles. Formed by me for myself, this ambition would have seemed to Bloch the mark of the most hideous snobbishness, quite in keeping with the opinion that he already held of a whole side of my nature which he did not regard \u2014 or at least had not hitherto regarded \u2014 as its most important side; but the same ambition in himself seemed to him the proof of a finely developed curiosity in a mind anxious to carry out certain social explorations from which he might perhaps glean some literary benefit. M. Bloch senior, when his son had told him that he was going to bring one of his friends in to dinner, and had in a sarcastic but satisfied tone enunciated the name and title of that friend: \u201cThe Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray,\u201d had been thrown into great commotion. \u201cThe Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray! I\u2019ll be jiggered!\u201d he had exclaimed, using the oath which was with him the strongest indication of social deference. And he cast at a son capable of having formed such an acquaintance an admiring glance which seemed to say: \u201cReally, it is astounding. Can this prodigy be indeed a child of mine?\u201d which gave my friend as much pleasure as if his monthly allowance had been increased by fifty francs. For Bloch was not in his element at home and felt that his father treated him like a lost sheep because of his lifelong admiration for Leconte de Lisle, Heredia and other \u2018Bohemians.\u2019 But to have got to know Saint-Loup-en-Bray, whose father had been chairman of the Suez Canal board (\u2018I\u2019ll be jiggered!\u2019) was an indisputable \u2018score.\u2019 What a pity, indeed, that they had left in Paris, for fear of its being broken on the journey, the stereoscope. Alone among men, M. Bloch senior had the art, or at least the right to exhibit it. He did this, moreover, on rare occasions only, and then to good purpose, on evenings when there was a full-dress affair, with hired waiters. So that from these exhibitions of the stereoscope there emanated, for those who were present, as it were a special distinction, a privileged position, and for the master of the house who gave them a reputation such as talent confers on a man \u2014 which could not have been greater had the photographs been taken by M. Bloch himself and the machine his own invention. \u201cYou weren\u2019t invited to Solomon\u2019s yesterday?\u201d one of the family would ask another. \u201cNo! I was not one of the elect. What was on?\u201d \u201cOh, a great how-d\u2019ye-do, the stereoscope, the whole box of tricks!\u201d \u201cIndeed! If they had the stereoscope I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t there; they say Solomon is quite amazing when he works it.\u201d\u2014\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped;\u201d said M. Bloch now to his son, \u201cit\u2019s a mistake to let him have everything at once; that would leave him nothing to look forward to.\u201d He had actually thought, in his paternal affection and in the hope of touching his son\u2019s heart, of sending for the instrument. But there was not time, or rather they had thought there would not be; for we were obliged to put off the dinner because Saint-Loup could not leave the hotel, where he was waiting for an uncle who was coming to spend a few days with Mme. de Villeparisis. Since \u2014 for he was greatly addicted to physical culture, and especially to long walks \u2014 it was largely on foot, spending the night in wayside farms, that this uncle was to make the journey from the country house in which he was staying, the precise date of his arrival at Balbec was by no means certain. And Saint-Loup, afraid to stir out of doors, even entrusted me with the duty of taking to Incauville, where the nearest telegraph-office was, the messages that he sent every day to his mistress. The uncle for whom we were waiting was called Palam\u00e8de, a name that had come down to him from his ancestors, the Princes of Sicily. And later on when I found, as I read history, belonging to this or that Podest\u00e0 or Prince of the Church, the same Christian name, a fine renaissance medal \u2014 some said, a genuine antique \u2014 that had always remained in the family, having passed from generation to generation, from the Vatican cabinet to the uncle of my friend, I felt the pleasure that is reserved for those who, unable from lack of means to start a case of medals, or a picture gallery, look out for old names (names of localities, instructive and picturesque as an old map, a bird\u2019s-eye view, a sign-board or a return of customs; baptismal names, in which rings out and is plainly heard, in their fine French endings, the defect of speech, the intonation of a racial vulgarity, the vicious pronunciation by which our ancestors made Latin and Saxon words undergo lasting mutilations which in due course became the august law-givers of our grammar books) and, in short, by drawing upon their collections of ancient and sonorous words, give themselves concerts like the people who acquire viols da gamba and viols d\u2019amour so as to perform the music of days gone by upon old-fashioned instruments. Saint-Loup told me that even in the most exclusive aristocratic society his uncle Palam\u00e8de had the further distinction of being particularly difficult to approach, contemptuous, double-dyed in his nobility, forming with his brother\u2019s wife and a few other chosen spirits what was known as the Phoenix Club. There even his insolence was so much dreaded that it had happened more than once that people of good position who had been anxious to meet him and had applied to his own brother for an introduction had met with a refusal: \u201cReally, you mustn\u2019t ask me to introduce you to my brother Palam\u00e8de. My wife and I, we would all of us do our best for you, but it would be no good. Besides, there\u2019s always the danger of his being rude to you, and I shouldn\u2019t like that.\u201d At the Jockey Club he had, with a few of his friends, marked a list of two hundred members whom they would never allow to be introduced to them. And in the Comte de Paris\u2019s circle he was known by the nickname of \u2018The Prince\u2019 because of his distinction and his pride\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup told me about his uncle\u2019s early life, now a long time ago. Every day he used to take women to a bachelor establishment which he shared with two of his friends, as good-looking as himself, on account of which they were known as \u2018The Three Graces.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOne day, a man who just now is very much in the eye, as Balzac would say, of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, but who at a rather awkward period of his early life displayed odd tastes, asked my uncle to let him come to this place. But no sooner had he arrived than it was not to the ladies but to my uncle Palam\u00e8de that he began to make overtures. My uncle pretended not to understand, made an excuse to send for his two friends; they appeared on the scene, seized the offender, stripped him, thrashed him till he bled, and then with twenty degrees of frost outside kicked him into the street where he was found more dead than alive; so much so that the police started an inquiry which the poor devil had the greatest difficulty in getting them to abandon. My uncle would never go in for such drastic methods now, in fact you can\u2019t conceive the number of men of humble position that he, who is so haughty with people in society, has shewn his affection, taken under his wing, even if he is paid for it with ingratitude. It may be a servant who has looked after him in a hotel, for whom he will find a place in Paris, or a farm-labourer whom he will pay to have taught a trade. That is really the rather nice side of his character, in contrast to his social side.\u201d Saint-Loup indeed belonged to that type of young men of fashion, situated at an altitude at which it has been possible to cultivate such expressions as: \u201cWhat is really rather nice about him,\u201d \u201cHis rather nice side,\u201d precious seeds which produce very rapidly a way of looking at things in which one counts oneself as nothing and the \u2018people\u2019 as everything; the exact opposite, in a word, of plebeian pride. \u201cIt seems, it is quite impossible to imagine how he set the tone, how he laid down the law for the whole of society when he was a young man. He acted entirely for himself; in any circumstances he did what seemed pleasing to himself, what was most convenient, but at once the snobs would start copying him. If he felt thirsty at the play, and sent out from his box for a drink, the little sitting-rooms behind all the boxes would be filled, a week later, with refreshments. One wet summer, when he had a touch of rheumatism, he ordered an ulster of a loose but warm vicuna wool, which is used only for travelling rugs, and kept the blue and orange stripes shewing. The big tailors at once received orders from all their customers for blue and orange ulsters of rough wool. If he had some reason for wishing to keep every trace of ceremony out of a dinner in a country house where he was spending the day, and to point the distinction had come without evening clothes and sat down to table in the suit he had been wearing that afternoon, it became the fashion, when you were dining in the country, not to dress. If he was eating some special sweet and instead of taking his spoon used a knife, or a special implement of his own invention which he had had made for him by a silversmith, or his fingers, it at once became wrong to eat it in any other way. He wanted once to hear some Beethoven quartets again (for with all his preposterous ideas he is no fool, mind, he has great gifts) and arranged for some musicians to come and play them to him and a few friends once a week. The ultra-fashionable thing that season was to give quite small parties, with chamber music. I should say he\u2019s not done at all badly out of life. With his looks, he must have had any number of women! I can\u2019t tell you exactly whom, for he is very discreet. But I do know that he was thoroughly unfaithful to my poor aunt. Not that that prevented his being always perfectly charming to her, and her adoring him; he was in mourning for her for years. When he is in Paris, he still goes to the cemetery nearly every day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The morning after Robert had told me all these things about his uncle, while he waited for him (and waited, as it happened, in vain), as I was coming by myself past the Casino on my way back to the hotel, I had the sensation of being watched by somebody who was not far off. I turned my head and saw a man of about forty, very tall and rather stout, with a very dark moustache, who, nervously slapping the leg of his trousers with a switch, kept fastened upon me a pair of eyes dilated with observation. Every now and then those eyes were shot through by a look of intense activity such as the sight of a person whom they do not know excites only in men to whom, for whatever reason, it suggests thoughts that would not occur to anyone else \u2014 madmen, for instance, or spies. He trained upon me a supreme stare at once bold, prudent, rapid and profound, like a last shot which one fires at an enemy at the moment when one turns to flee, and, after first looking all round him, suddenly adopting an absent and lofty air, by an abrupt revolution of his whole body turned to examine a playbill on the wall in the reading of which he became absorbed, while he hummed a tune and fingered the moss-rose in his buttonhole. He drew from his pocket a note-book in which he appeared to be taking down the title of the performance that was announced, looked two or three times at his watch, pulled down over his eyes a black straw hat the brim of which he extended with his hand held out over it like a visor, as though to see whether some one were at last coming, made the perfunctory gesture of annoyance by which people mean to shew that they have waited long enough, although they never make it when they are really waiting, then pushing back his hat and exposing a scalp cropped close except at the sides where he allowed a pair of waved \u2018pigeon\u2019s-wings\u2019 to grow quite long, he emitted the loud panting breath that people give who are not feeling too hot but would like it to be thought that they were. He gave me the impression of a \u2018hotel crook\u2019 who had been watching my grandmother and myself for some days, and while he was planning to rob us had just discovered that I had surprised him in the act of spying; to put me off the scent, perhaps he was seeking only, by his new attitude, to express boredom and detachment, but it was with an exaggeration so aggressive that his object appeared to be \u2014 at least as much as the dissipating of the suspicions that I must have had of him \u2014 to avenge a humiliation which quite unconsciously I must have inflicted on him, to give me the idea not so much that he had not seen me as that I was an object of too little importance to attract his attention. He threw back his shoulders with an air of bravado, bit his lips, pushed up his moustache, and in the lens of his eyes made an adjustment of something that was indifferent, harsh, almost insulting. So effectively that the singularity of his expression made me take him at one moment for a thief and at another for a lunatic. And yet his scrupulously ordered attire was far more sober and far more simple than that of any of the summer visitors I saw at Balbec, and gave a reassurance to my own suit, so often humiliated by the dazzling and commonplace whiteness of their holiday garb. But my grandmother was coming towards me, we took a turn together, and I was waiting for her, an hour later, outside the hotel into which she had gone for a moment, when I saw emerge from it Mme. de Villeparisis with Robert de Saint-Loup and the stranger who had stared at me so intently outside the Casino. Swift as a lightning-flash his look shot through me, just as at the moment when I first noticed him, and returned, as though he had not seen me, to hover, slightly lowered, before his eyes, dulled, like the neutral look which feigns to see nothing without and is incapable of reporting anything to the mind within, the look which expresses merely the satisfaction of feeling round it the eyelids which it cleaves apart with its sanctimonious roundness, the devout, the steeped look that we see on the faces of certain hypocrites, the smug look on those of certain fools. I saw that he had changed his clothes. The suit he was wearing was darker even than the other; and no doubt this was because the true distinction in dress lies nearer to simplicity than the false; but there was something more; when one came near him one felt that if colour was almost entirely absent from these garments it was not because he who had banished it from them was indifferent to it but rather because for some reason he forbade himself the enjoyment of it. And the sobriety which they displayed seemed to be of the kind that comes from obedience to a rule of diet rather than from want of appetite. A dark green thread harmonised, in the stuff of his trousers, with the clock on his socks, with a refinement which betrayed the vivacity of a taste that was everywhere else conquered, to which this single concession had been made out of tolerance for such a weakness, while a spot of red on his necktie was imperceptible, like a liberty which one dares not take\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow are you? Let me introduce my nephew, the Baron de Guermantes,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis greeted me, while the stranger without looking at me, muttering a vague \u201cCharmed!\u201d which he followed with a \u201cH\u2019m, h\u2019m, h\u2019m\u201d to give his affability an air of having been forced, and doubling back his little finger, forefinger and thumb, held out to me his middle and ring fingers, the latter bare of any ring, which I clasped through his suede glove; then, without lifting his eyes to my face, he turned towards Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood gracious; I shall be forgetting my own name next!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cHere am I calling you Baron de Guermantes. Let me introduce the Baron de Charlus. After all, it\u2019s not a very serious mistake,\u201d she went on, \u201cfor you\u2019re a thorough Guermantes whatever else you are.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this time my grandmother had reappeared, and we all set out together. Saint-Loup\u2019s uncle declined to honour me not only with a word, with so much as a look, even, in my direction. If he stared strangers out of countenance (and during this short excursion he two or three times hurled his terrible and searching scrutiny like a sounding lead at insignificant people of obviously humble extraction who happened to pass), to make up for that he never for a moment, if I was to judge by myself, looked at the people whom he did know, just as a detective on special duty might except his personal friends from his professional vigilance. Leaving them \u2014 my grandmother, Mme. de Villeparisis and him \u2014 to talk to one another, I fell behind with Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me, am I right in thinking I heard Mme. de Villeparisis say just now to your uncle that he was a Guermantes?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course he is; Palam\u00e8de de Guermantes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot the same Guermantes who have a place near Combray, and claim descent from Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMost certainly: my uncle, who is the very last word in heraldry and all that sort of thing, would tell you that our \u2018cry,\u2019 our war-cry, that is to say, which was changed afterwards to \u2018Passavant\u2019 was originally \u2018Combraysis,\u2019\u201d he said, smiling so as not to appear to be priding himself on this prerogative of a \u2018cry,\u2019 which only the semi-royal houses, the great chiefs of feudal bands enjoyed. \u201cIt\u2019s his brother who has the place now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so she was indeed related, and quite closely, to the Guermantes, this Mme. de Villeparisis who had so long been for me the lady who had given me a duck filled with chocolates, when I was little, more remote then from the Guermantes way than if she had been shut up somewhere on the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, less brilliant, less highly placed by me than was the Combray optician, and who now suddenly went through one of those fantastic rises in value, parallel to the depreciations, no less unforeseen, of other objects in our possession, which \u2014 rise and fall alike \u2014 introduce in our youth and in those periods of our life in which a trace of youth persists changes as numerous as the Metamorphoses of Ovid\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHaven\u2019t they got, down there, the busts of all the old lords of Guermantes?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes; and a lovely sight they are!\u201d Saint-Loup was ironical. \u201cBetween you and me, I look on all that sort of thing as rather a joke. But they have got at Guermantes, what is a little more interesting, and, that is quite a touching portrait of my aunt by Carri\u00e8re. It\u2019s as fine as Whistler or Velasquez,\u201d went on Saint-Loup, who in his neophyte zeal was not always very exact about degrees of greatness. \u201cThere are also some moving pictures by Gustave Moreau. My aunt is the niece of your friend Mme. de Ville-parisis; she was brought up by her, and married her cousin, who was a nephew, too, of my aunt Villeparisis, the present Duc de Guermantes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen who is this uncle?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe bears the title of Baron de Charlus. Properly speaking, when my great-uncle died, my uncle Palam\u00e8de ought to have taken the title of Prince des Laumes, which his brother used before he became Duc de Guermantes, for in that family they change their names as you\u2019d change your shirt. But my uncle has peculiar ideas about all that sort of thing. And as he feels that people are rather apt to overdo the Italian Prince and Grandee of Spain business nowadays, though he had half-a-dozen titles of \u2018Prince\u2019 to choose from, he has remained Baron de Charlus, as a protest, and with an apparent simplicity which really covers a good deal of pride. \u2018In these days,\u2019 he says, \u2018everybody is Prince something-or-other; one really must have a title that will distinguish one; I shall call myself Prince when I wish to travel incognito.\u2019 According to him there is no older title than the Charlus barony; to prove to you that it is earlier than the Montmorency title, though they used to claim, quite wrongly, to be the premier barons of France when they were only premier in the He de France, where their fief was, my uncle will explain to you for hours on end and enjoy doing it, because, although he\u2019s a most intelligent man, really gifted, he regards that sort of thing as quite a live topic of conversation,\u201d Saint-Loup smiled again. \u201cBut as I am not like him, you mustn\u2019t ask me to talk pedigrees; I know nothing more deadly, more perishing; really, life is not long enough.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I now recognised in the hard look which had made me turn round that morning outside the Casino the same that I had seen fixed on me at Tan-sonville, at the moment when Mme. Swann called Gilberte away\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, I say, all those mistresses that, you told me, your uncle M. de Charlus had had, wasn\u2019t Mme. Swann one of them?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood lord, no! That is to say, my uncle\u2019s a great friend of Swann, and has always stood up for him. But no one has ever suggested that he was his wife\u2019s lover. You would make a great sensation in Paris society if people thought you believed that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I dared not reply that it would have caused an even greater sensation in Combray society if people had thought that I did not believe it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother was delighted with M. de Charlus. No doubt he attached an extreme importance to all questions of birth and social position, and my grandmother had remarked this, but without any trace of that severity which as a rule embodies a secret envy and the annoyance of seeing some one else enjoy an advantage which one would like but cannot oneself possess. As on the other hand my grandmother, content with her lot and never for a moment regretting that she did not move in a more brilliant sphere, employed only her intellect in observing the eccentricities of M. de Charlus, she spoke of Saint-Loup\u2019s uncle with that detached, smiling, almost affectionate kindness with which we reward the object of our disinterested study for the pleasure that it has given us, all the more that this time the object was a person with regard to whom she found that his if not legitimate, at any rate picturesque pretensions shewed him in vivid contrast to the people whom she generally had occasion to see. But it was especially in consideration of his intelligence and sensibility, qualities which it was easy to see that M. de Charlus, unlike so many of the people in society whom Saint-Loup derided, possessed in a marked degree, that my grandmother had so readily forgiven him his aristocratic prejudice. And yet this had not been sacrificed by the uncle, as it was by the nephew, to higher qualities. Rather, M. de Charlus had reconciled it with them. Possessing, by virtue of his descent from the Ducs de Nemours and Princes de Lamballe, documents, furniture, tapestries, portraits painted for his ancestors by Raphael, Velasquez, Boucher, justified in saying that he was visiting a museum and a matchless library when he was merely turning over his family relics at home, he placed in the rank from which his nephew had degraded it the whole heritage of the aristocracy. Perhaps also, being less metaphysical than Saint-Loup, less satisfied with words, more of a realist in his study of men, he did not care to neglect a factor that was essential to his prestige in their eyes and, if it gave certain disinterested pleasures to his imagination, could often be a powerfully effective aid to his utilitarian activities. No agreement can ever be reached between men of his sort and those who obey the ideal within them which urges them to strip themselves bare of such advantages so that they may seek only to realise that ideal, similar in that respect to the painters, the writers who renounce their virtuosity, the artistic peoples who modernise themselves, warrior peoples who take the initiative in a move for universal disarmament, absolute governments which turn democratic and repeal their harsh laws, though as often as not the sequel fails to reward their noble effort; for the men lose their talent, the nations their secular predominance; \u2018pacificism\u2019 often multiplies wars and indulgence criminality. If Saint-Loup\u2019s efforts towards sincerity and emancipation were only to be commended as most noble, to judge by their visible result, one could still be thankful that they had failed to bear fruit in M. de Charlus, who had transferred to his own home much of the admirable panelling from the Guermantes house, instead of substituting, like his nephew, a \u2018modern style\u2019 of decoration, employing Lebourg or Guillaumin. It was none the less true that M. de Charlus\u2019s ideal was highly artificial, and, if the epithet can be applied to the word ideal, as much social as artistic. In certain women of great beauty and rare culture whose ancestresses, two centuries earlier, had shared in all the glory and grace of the old order, he found a distinction which made him take pleasure only in their society, and no doubt the admiration for them which he had protested was sincere, but countless reminiscences; historical and artistic, called forth by their names, entered into and formed a great part of it, just as suggestions of classical antiquity are one of the reasons for the pleasure which a booklover finds in reading an Ode of Horace that is perhaps inferior to poems of our own day which would leave the same booklover cold. Any of these women by the side of a pretty commoner was for him what are, hanging beside a contemporary canvas representing a procession or a wedding, those old pictures the history of which we know, from the Pope or King who ordered them, through the hands of people whose acquisition of them, by gift, purchase, conquest or inheritance, recalls to us some event or at least some alliance of historic interest, and consequently some knowledge that we ourselves have acquired, gives it a fresh utility, increases our sense of the richness of the possessions of our memory or of our erudition. M. de Charlus might be thankful that a prejudice similar to his own, by preventing these several great ladies from mixing with women whose blood was less pure, presented them for his veneration unspoiled, in their unaltered nobility, like an eighteenth-century house-front supported on its flat columns of pink marble, in which the passage of time has wrought no change\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus praised the true \u2018nobility\u2019 of mind and heart which characterised these women, playing upon the word in a double sense by which he himself was taken in, and in which lay the falsehood of this bastard conception, of this medley of aristocracy, generosity and art, but also its seductiveness, dangerous to people like my grandmother, to whom the less refined but more innocent prejudice of a nobleman who cared only about quarterings and took no thought for anything besides would have appeared too silly for words, whereas she was defenceless as soon as a thing presented itself under the externals of a mental superiority, so much so, indeed, that she regarded Princes as enviable above all other men because they were able to have a Labruy\u00e8re, a F\u00e9nelon as their tutors. Outside the Grand Hotel the three Guermantes left us; they were going to luncheon with the Princesse de Luxembourg. While my grandmother was saying good-bye to Mme. de Villcparisis and Saint-Loup to my grandmother, M. de Charlus who, so far, had not uttered a word to me, drew back a little way from the group and, when he reached my side, said: \u201cI shall be taking tea this evening after dinner in my aunt Villeparisis\u2019s room; I hope that you will give me the pleasure of seeing you there, and your grandmother.\u201d With which he rejoined the Marquise\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although it was Sunday there were no more carriages waiting outside the hotel now than at the beginning of the season. The solicitor\u2019s wife, in particular, had decided that it was not worth the expense of hiring one every time simply because she was not going to the Cambremers\u2019, and contented herself with staying in her room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs Mme. Blandais not well?\u201d her husband was asked. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen her all day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe has a slight headache; it\u2019s the heat, there\u2019s thunder coming. The least thing upsets her; but I expect you will see her this evening; I\u2019ve told her she ought to come down. It can\u2019t do her any harm.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had supposed that in thus inviting us to take tea with his aunt, whom I never doubted that he would have warned that we were coming, M. de Charlus wished to make amends for the impoliteness which he had shewn me during our walk that morning. But when, on our entering Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s room, I attempted to greet her nephew, even although I walked right round him, while in shrill accents he was telling a somewhat spiteful story about one of his relatives, I did not succeed in catching his eye; I decided to say \u201cGood evening\u201d to him, and fairly loud, to warn him of my presence; but I realised that he had observed it, for before ever a word had passed my lips, just as I began to bow to him, I saw his two fingers stretched out for me to shake without his having turned to look at me or paused in his story. He had evidently seen me, without letting it appear that he had, and I noticed then that his eyes, which were never fixed on the person to whom he was speaking, strayed perpetually in all directions, like those of certain animals when they are frightened, or those of street hawkers who, while they are bawling their patter and displaying their illicit merchandise, keep a sharp look-out, though without turning their heads, on the different points of the horizon from any of which may appear, suddenly, the police. At the same time I was a little surprised to find that Mme. de Villeparisis, while glad to see us, did not seem to have been expecting us, and I was still more surprised to hear M. de Charlus say to my grandmother: \u201cAh! that was a capital idea of yours to come and pay us a visit; charming of them, is it not, my dear aunt?\u201d No doubt he had noticed his aunt\u2019s surprise at our entry and thought, as a man accustomed to set the tone, to strike the right note, that it would be enough to transform that surprise into joy were he to shew that he himself felt it, that it was indeed the feeling which our arrival there ought to have prompted. In which he calculated wisely; for Mme. de Villeparisis, who had a high opinion of her nephew and knew how difficult it was to please him, appeared suddenly to have found new attractions in my grandmother and continued to make much of her. But I failed to understand how M. de Charlus could, in the space of a few hours, have forgotten the invitation \u2014 so curt but apparently so intentional, so premeditated \u2014 which he had addressed to me that same morning, or why he called a \u2018capital idea\u2019 on my grandmother\u2019s part an idea that had been entirely his own. With a scruple of accuracy which I retained until I had reached the age at which I realised that it is not by asking him questions that one learns the truth of what another man has had in his mind, and that the risk of a misunderstanding which will probably pass unobserved is less than that which may come from a purblind insistence: \u201cBut, sir,\u201d I reminded him, \u201cyou remember, surely, that it was you who asked me if we would come in this evening?\u201d Not a sound, not a movement betrayed that M. de Charlus had so much as heard my question. Seeing which I repeated it, like a diplomat, or like young men after a misunderstanding who endeavour, with untiring and unrewarded zeal, to obtain an explanation which their adversary is determined not to give them. Still M. de Charlus answered me not a word. I seemed to see hovering upon his lips the smile of those who from a great height pass judgment on the characters and breeding of their inferiors\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since he refused to give any explanation, I tried to provide one for myself, but succeeded only in hesitating between several, none of which could be the right one. Perhaps he did not remember, or perhaps it was I who had failed to understand what he had said to me that morning. . . . More probably, in his pride, he did not wish to appear to have sought to attract people whom he despised, and preferred to cast upon them the responsibility for their intrusion. But then, if he despised us, why had he been so anxious that we should come, or rather that my grandmother should come, for of the two of us it was to her alone that he spoke that evening, and never once to me. Talking with the utmost animation to her, as also to Mme. de Villeparisis, hiding, so to speak, behind them, as though he were seated at the back of a theatre-box, he contented himself, turning from them every now and then the exploring gaze of his penetrating eyes, with fastening it on my face, with the same gravity, the same air of preoccupation as if my face had been a manuscript difficult to decipher\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt, if he had not had those eyes, the face of M. de Charlus would have been similar to the faces of many good-looking men. And when Saint-Loup, speaking to me of various other Guermantes, on a later occasion, said: \u201cGad, they\u2019ve not got that thoroughbred air, of being gentlemen to their finger-tips, that uncle Palam\u00e8de has!\u201d confirming my suspicion that a thoroughbred air and aristocratic distinction were not anything mysterious and new but consisted in elements which I had recognised without difficulty and without receiving any particular impression from them, I was to feel that another of my illusions had been shattered. But that face, to which a faint layer of powder gave almost the appearance of a face on the stage, in vain might M. de Charlus hermetically seal its expression; his eyes were like two crevices, two loopholes which alone he had failed to stop, and through which, according to where one stood or sat in relation to him, one felt suddenly flash across one the glow of some internal engine which seemed to offer no reassurance even to him who without being altogether master of it must carry it inside him, at an unstable equilibrium and always on the point of explosion; and the circumspect and unceasingly restless expression of those eyes, with all the signs of exhaustion which, extending from them to a pair of dark rings quite low down upon his cheeks, were stamped on his face, however carefully he might compose and regulate it, made one think of some incognito, some disguise assumed by a powerful mam in danger, or merely by a dangerous \u2014 but tragic \u2014 person. I should have liked to divine what was this secret which other men did not carry in their breasts and which had already made M. de Charlus\u2019s gaze so enigmatic to me when I had seen him that morning outside the Casino. But with what I now knew of his family I could no longer believe that they were the eyes of a thief, nor, after what I had heard of his conversation, could I say that they were those of a madman. If he was cold with me, while making himself agreeable to my grandmother, that arose perhaps not from a personal antipathy for, generally speaking, just as he was kindly disposed towards women, of whose faults he used to speak without, as a rule, any narrowing of the broadest tolerance, so he shewed with regard to men, and especially young men, a hatred so violent as to suggest that of certain extreme misogynists for women. Two or three \u2018carpet-knights,\u2019 relatives or intimate friends of Saint-Loup who happened to mention their names, M. de Charlus, with an almost ferocious expression, in sharp contrast to his usual coldness, called: \u201cLittle cads!\u201d I gathered that the particular fault which he found in the young men of the period was their extreme effeminacy. \u201cThey\u2019re absolute women,\u201d he said with scorn. But what life would not have appeared effeminate beside that which he expected a man to lead, and never found energetic or virile enough? (He himself, when he walked across country, after long hours on the road would plunge his heated body into frozen streams.) He would not even allow a man to wear a single ring. But this profession of virility did not prevent his having also the most delicate sensibilities. When Mme. de Villeparisis asked him to describe to my grandmother some country house in which Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 had stayed, adding that she could not help feeling that there was something rather \u2018literary\u2019 about that lady\u2019s distress at being parted from \u201cthat tiresome Mme. de Grignan\u201d:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he retorted, \u201cI can think of nothing more true. Besides, it was a time in which feelings of that sort were thoroughly understood. The inhabitant of Lafontaine\u2019s Monomotapa, running to see his friend who had appeared to him in a dream, and had looked sad, the pigeon finding that the greatest of evils is the absence of the other pigeon, seem to you perhaps, my dear aunt, as exaggerated as Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9\u2018s impatience for the moment when she will be alone with her daughter. It is so fine what she says when she leaves her: \u2018This parting gives a pain to my soul which I feel like an ache in my body. In absence one is liberal with the hours. One anticipates a time for which one is longing.\u2019\u201d My grandmother was in ecstasies at hearing the Letters thus spoken of, exactly as she would have spoken of them herself. She was astonished that a man could understand them so thoroughly. She found in M. de Charlus a delicacy, a sensibility that were quite feminine. We said to each other afterwards, when we were by ourselves and began to discuss him together, that he must have come under the strong influence of a woman, his mother, or in later life his daughter if he had any children. \u201cA mistress, perhaps,\u201d I thought to myself, remembering the influence that Saint-Loup\u2019s seemed to have had over him, which enabled me to realise the point to which men can be refined by the women with whom they live\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOnce she was with her daughter, ^he had probably nothing to say to her,\u201d put in Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMost certainly she had: if it was only what she calls \u2018things so slight that nobody else would notice them but you and me.\u2019 And anyhow she was with her. And Labruy\u00e8re tells us that that is everything. \u2018To be with the people one loves, to speak to them, not to speak to them, it is all the same.\u2019 He is right; that is the only form of happiness,\u201d added M. de Charlus in a mournful voice, \u201cand that happiness \u2014 alas, life is so ill arranged that one very rarely tastes it; Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 was after all less to be pitied than most of us. She spent a great part of her life with the person whom she loved.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou forget that it was not \u2018love\u2019 in her case; the person was her daughter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut what matters in life is not whom or what one loves,\u201d he went on, in a judicial, peremptory, almost a cutting tone; \u201cit is the fact of loving. What Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 felt for her daughter has a far better claim to rank with the passion that Racine described in Andromaque or Ph\u00e8dre than the commonplace relations young S\u00e9vign\u00e9 had with his mistresses. It\u2019s the same with a mystic\u2019s love for his God. The hard and fast lines with which we circumscribe love arise solely from our complete ignorance of life.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou think all that of Andromaque and Ph\u00e8dre, do you?\u201d Saint-Loup asked his uncle in a faintly contemptuous tone. \u201cThere is more truth in a single tragedy of Racine than in all the dramatic works of Monsieur Victor Hugo,\u201d replied M. de Charlus. \u201cPeople really are overwhelming,\u201d Saint-Loup murmured in my ear. \u201cPreferring Racine to Victor, you may say what you like, it\u2019s epoch-making!\u201d He was genuinely distressed by his uncle\u2019s words, but the satisfaction of saying \u201cyou may say what you like\u201d and, better still, \u201cepoch-making\u201d consoled him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In these reflexions upon the sadness of having to live apart from the person whom one loves (which were to lead my grandmother to say to me that Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s nephew understood certain things quite as well as his aunt, but in a different way, and moreover had something about him that set him far above the average clubman) M. de Charlus not only allowed a refinement of feeling to appear such as men rarely shew; his voice itself, like certain contralto voices which have not been properly trained to the right pitch, so that when they sing it sounds like a duet between a young man and a woman, singing alternately, mounted, when he expressed these delicate sentiments, to its higher notes, took on an unexpected sweetness and seemed to be embodying choirs of betrothed maidens, of sisters, who poured out the treasures of their love. But the bevy of young girls, whom M. de Charlus in his horror of every kind of effeminacy would have been so distressed to learn that he gave the impression of sheltering thus within his voice, did not confine themselves to the interpretation, the modulation of scraps of sentiment. Often while M. de Charlus was talking one could hear their laughter, shrill, fresh laughter of school-girls or coquettes quizzing their partners with all the archness of clever tongues and pretty wits\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He told us how a house that had belonged to his family, in which Marie Antoinette had slept, with a park laid out by Len\u00f4tre, was now in the hands of the Israels, the wealthy financiers, who had bought it. \u201cIsrael \u2014 at least that is the name these people go by, which seems to me a generic, a racial term rather than a proper name. One cannot tell; possibly people of that sort do not have names, and are designated only by the collective title of the tribe to which they belong. It is of no importance! But fancy, after being a home of the Guermantes, to belong to Israels!!!\u201d His voice rose. \u201cIt reminds me of a room in the Ch\u00e2teau of Blois where the caretaker who was shewing me over said: \u2018This is where Mary Stuart used to say her prayers; I use it to keep my brooms in.\u2019 Naturally I wish to know nothing more of this house that has let itself be dishonoured, any more than of my cousin Clara de Chimay after she left her husband. But I keep a photograph of the house, when it was still unspoiled, just as I keep one of the Princess before her large eyes had learned to gaze on anyone but my cousin. A photograph acquires something of the dignity which it ordinarily lacks when it ceases to be a reproduction of reality and shews us things that no longer exist. I could give you a copy, since you are interested in that style of architecture,\u201d he said to my grandmother. At that moment, noticing that the embroidered handkerchief which he had in his pocket was shewing some coloured threads, he thrust it sharply down out of sight with the scandalised air of a prudish but far from innocent lady concealing attractions which, by an excess of scrupulosity, she regards as indecent. \u201cWould you believe,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat the first thing the creatures did was to destroy Len\u00f4tre\u2019s park, which is as bad as slashing a picture by Poussin? For that alone, these Israels ought to be in prison. It is true,\u201d he added with a smile, after a moment\u2019s silence, \u201cthat there are probably plenty of other reasons why they should be there! In any case, you can imagine the effect, with that architecture behind it, of an English garden.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut the house is in the same style as the Petit Trianon,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cand Marie-Antoinette had an English garden laid out there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhich, all the same, ruins Gabriel\u2019s front,\u201d replied M. de Charlus. \u201cObviously, it would be an act of vandalism now to destroy the Hameau. But whatever may be the spirit of the age, I doubt, all the same, whether, in that respect, a whim of Mme. Israel has the same importance as the memory of the Queen.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile my grandmother had been making signs to me to go up to bed, in spite of the urgent appeals of Saint-Loup who, to my utter confusion, had alluded in front of M. de Charlus to the depression that used often to come upon me at night before I went to sleep, which his uncle must regard as betokening a sad want of virility. I lingered a few moments still, then went upstairs, and was greatly surprised when, a little later, having heard a knock at my bedroom door and asked who was there, I heard the voice of M. de Charlus saying dryly:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is Charlus. May I come in, sir? Sir,\u201d he began again in the same tone as soon as he had shut the door, \u201cmy nephew was saying just now that you were apt to be worried at night before going to sleep, and also that you were an admirer of Bergotte\u2019s books. As I had one here in my luggage which you probably do not know, I have brought it to help you to while away these moments in which you are not comfortable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I thanked M. de Charlus with some warmth and told him that, on the contrary, I had been afraid that what Saint-Loup had said to him about my discomfort when night came would have made me appear in his eyes more stupid even than I was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; why?\u201d he answered, in a gentler voice. \u201cYou have not, perhaps, any personal merit; so few of us have! But for a time at least you have youth, and that is always a charm. Besides, sir, the greatest folly of all is to laugh at or to condemn in others what one does not happen oneself to feel. I love the night, and you tell me that you are afraid of it. I love the scent of roses, and I have a friend whom it throws into a fever. Do you suppose that I think, for that reason, that he is inferior to me? I try to understand everything and I take care to condemn nothing. After all, you must not be too sorry for yourself; I do not say that these moods of depression are not painful, I know that one can be made to suffer by things which the world would not understand. But at least you have placed your affection wisely, in your grandmother. You see a great deal of her. And besides, that is a legitimate affection, I mean one that is repaid. There are so many of which one cannot say that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He began walking up and down the room, looking at one thing, taking up another. I had the impression that he had something to tell me, and could not find the right words to express it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have another volume of Bergotte here; I will fetch it for you,\u201d he went on, and rang the bell. Presently a page came. \u201cGo and find me your head waiter. He is the only person here who is capable of obeying an order intelligently,\u201d said M. de Charlus stiffly. \u201cMonsieur Aim\u00e9, sir?\u201d asked the page. \u201cI cannot tell you his name; yes, I remember now, I did hear him called Aim\u00e9. Run along, I am in a hurry.\u201d \u201cHe won\u2019t be a minute, sir, I saw him downstairs just now,\u201d said the page, anxious to appear efficient. There was an interval of silence. The page returned. \u201cSir, M. Aim\u00e9 has gone to bed. But I can take your message.\u201d \u201cNo, you have only to get him out of bed.\u201d \u201cBut I can\u2019t do that, sir; he doesn\u2019t sleep here.\u201d \u201cThen you can leave us alone.\u201d \u201cBut, sir,\u201d I said when the page had gone, \u201cyou are too kind; one volume of Bergotte will be quite enough.\u201d \u201cThat is just what I was thinking.\u201d M. de Charlus walked up and down the room. Several minutes passed in this way, then after a prolonged hesitation, and several false starts, he swung sharply round and, his voice once more stinging, flung at me: \u201cGood night, sir!\u201d and left the room. After all the lofty sentiments which I had heard him express that evening, next day, which was the day of his departure, on the beach, before noon, when I was on my way down to bathe, and M. de Charlus had come across to tell me that my grandmother was waiting for me to join her as soon as I left the water, I was greatly surprised to hear him say, pinching my neck as he spoke, with a familiarity and a laugh that were frankly vulgar:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut he doesn\u2019t give a damn for his old grandmother, does he, eh? Little rascal!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat, sir! I adore her!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSir,\u201d he said, stepping back a pace, and with a glacial air, \u201cyou are still young; you should profit by your youth to learn two things; first, to refrain from expressing sentiments that are too natural not to be taken for granted; and secondly not to dash into speech to reply to things that are said to you before you have penetrated their meaning. If you had taken this precaution a moment ago you would have saved yourself the appearance of speaking at cross-purposes like a deaf man, thereby adding a second absurdity to that of having anchors embroidered on your bathing-dress. I have lent you a book by Bergotte which I require. See that it is brought to me within the next hour by that head waiter with the silly and inappropriate name, who, I suppose, is not in bed at this time of day. You make me see that I was premature in speaking to you last night of the charms of youth; I should have done you a better service had I pointed out to you its thoughtlessness, its inconsequence, and its want of comprehension. I hope, sir, that this little douche will be no less salutary to you than your bathe. But don\u2019t let me keep you standing: you may catch cold. Good day, sir.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt he was sorry afterwards for this speech, for some time later I received \u2014 in a morocco binding on the front of which was inlaid a panel of tooled leather representing in demi-relief a spray of forget-me-nots \u2014 the book which he had lent me, and I had sent back to him, not by Aim\u00e9 who was apparently \u2018off duty,\u2019 but by the lift-boy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus having gone, Robert and I were free at last to dine with Bloch. And I realised during this little party that the stories too readily admitted by our friend as funny were favourite stories of M. Bloch senior, and that the son\u2019s \u2018really remarkable person\u2019 was always one of his father\u2019s friends whom he had so classified. There are a certain number of people whom we admire in our boyhood, a father with better brains than the rest of the family, a teacher who acquires credit in our eyes from the philosophy he reveals to us, a schoolfellow more advanced than we are (which was what Bloch had been to me), who despises the Musset of the Espoir en Dieu when we still admire it, and when we have reached Le-conte or Claudel will be in ecstasies only over:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Saint-Biaise, \u00e0 la Zuecca\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Vous \u00e9tiez, vous \u00e9tiez bien aise:\n\nWith which he will include:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Padoue est un fort bel endroit\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O\u00f9 de tr\u00e8s grands docteurs en droit\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mais j\u2019aime mieux la polenta\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Passe dans mon domino noir\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0La Toppatelle\n\nAnd of all the Nuits will remember only:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Au Havre, devant l\u2019Atlantique\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Venise, \u00e0 l\u2019affreux Lido\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O\u00f9 vient sur l\u2019herbe d\u2019un tombeau\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mourir la p\u00e2le Adriatique\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So, whenever we confidently admire anyone, we collect from him, we quote with admiration sayings vastly inferior to the sort which, left to our own judgment, we would sternly reject, just as the writer of a novel puts into it, on the pretext that they are true, things which people have actually said, which in the living context are like a dead weight, form the dull part of the work. Saint-Simon\u2019s portraits composed by himself (and very likely without his admiring them himself) are admirable, whereas what he cites as the charming wit of his clever friends is frankly dull where it has not become meaningless. He would have scorned to invent what he reports as so pointed or so coloured when said by Mme. Cornuel or Louis XIV, a point which is to be remarked also in many other writers, and is capable of various interpretations, of which it is enough to note but one for the present: namely, that in the state of mind in which we \u2018observe\u2019 we are a long way below the level to which we rise when we create\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was, then, embedded in my friend Bloch a father Bloch who lagged forty years behind his son, told impossible stories and laughed as loudly at them from the heart of my friend as did\u2019 the separate, visible and authentic father Bloch, since to the laugh which the latter emitted, not without several times repeating the last word so that his public might taste the full flavour of the story, was added the braying laugh with which the son never failed, at table, to greet his father\u2019s anecdotes. Thus it came about that after saying the most intelligent things young Bloch, to indicate the portion that he had inherited from his family, would tell us for the thirtieth time some of the gems which father Bloch brought out only (with his swallow-tail coat) on the solemn occasions on which young Bloch brought someone to the house on whom it was worth while making an impression; one of his masters, a \u2018chum\u2019 who had taken all the prizes, or, this evening, Saint-Loup and myself. For instance: \u201cA military critic of great insight, who had brilliantly worked out, supporting them with proofs, the reasons for which, in the Russo-Japanese war, the Japanese must inevitably be beaten and the Russians victorious,\u201d or else: \u201cHe is an eminent gentleman who passes for a great financier in political circles and for a great politician among financiers.\u201d These stories were interchangeable with one about Baron de Rothschild and one about Sir Rufus Israels, who were brought into the conversation in an equivocal manner which might let it be supposed that M. Bloch knew them personally\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was myself taken in, and from the way in which M. Bloch spoke of Bergotte I assumed that he too was an old friend. But with him as with all famous people, M. Bloch knew them only \u2018without actually knowing them,\u2019 from having seen them at a distance in the theatre or in the street. He imagined, moreover, that his appearance, his name, his personality were not unknown to them, and that when they caught sight of him they had often to repress a stealthy inclination to bow. People in society, because they know men of talent, original characters, and have them to dine in their houses, do not on that account understand them any better. But when one has lived to some extent in society, the silliness of its inhabitants makes one too anxious to live, suppose too high a standard of intelligence in the obscure circles in which people know only \u2018without actually knowing.\u2019 I was to discover this when I introduced the topic of Bergotte. M. Bloch was not the only one who was a social success at home. My friend was even more so with his sisters, whom he continually questioned in a hectoring tone, burying his face in his plate, all of which made them laugh until they cried. They had adopted their brother\u2019s language, and spoke it fluently, as if it had been obligatory and the only form of speech that people of intelligence might use. When we arrived, the eldest sister said to one of the younger ones: \u201cGo, tell our sage father and our venerable mother!\u201d \u201cPuppies,\u201d said Bloch, \u201cI present to you the cavalier Saint-Loup, hurler of javelins, who is come for a few days from Donci\u00e8res to the dwellings of polished stone, fruitful in horses.\u201d And, since he was as vulgar as he was literary, his speech ended as a rule in some pleasantry of a less Homeric kind: \u201cSee, draw closer your pepla with fair clasps, what is all that that I see? Does your mother know you\u2019re out?\u201d And the Misses Bloch subsided in a tempest of laughter. I told their brother how much pleasure he had given me by recommending me to read Bergotte, whose books I had loved\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Bloch senior, who knew Bergotte only by sight, and Bergotte\u2019s life only from what was common gossip, had a manner quite as indirect of making the acquaintance of his books, by the help of criticisms that were apparently literary. He lived in the world of \u2018very nearlies,\u2019 where people salute the empty air and arrive at wrong judgments. Inexactitude, incompetence do not modify their assurance; quite the contrary. It is the propitious miracle of self-esteem that, since few of us are in a position to enjoy the society of distinguished people, or to form intellectual friendships, those to whom they are denied still believe themselves to be the best endowed of men, because the optics of our social perspective make every grade of society seem the best to him who occupies it, and beholds as less favoured than himself, less fortunate and therefore to be pitied, the greater men whom he names and calumniates without knowing, judges and \u2014 despises without understanding them. Even in cases where the multiplication of his modest personal advantages by his self-esteem would not suffice to assure a man the dose of happiness, superior to that accorded to others, which is essential to him, envy is always there to make up the balance. It is true that if envy finds expression in scornful phrases, we must translate \u2018I have no wish to know him\u2019 by \u2018I have no means of knowing him.\u2019 That is the intellectual sense. But the emotional sense is indeed, \u2018I have no wish to know him.\u2019 The speaker knows that it is not true, but he does not, all the same, say it simply to deceive; he says it because it is what he feels, and that is sufficient to bridge the gulf between them, that is to say to make him happy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Self-centredness thus enabling every human being to see the universe spread out in a descending scale beneath himself who is its lord, M. Bloch afforded himself the luxury of being pitiless when in the morning, as he drank his chocolate, seeing Bergotte\u2019s signature at the foot of an article in the newspaper which he had scarcely opened, he disdainfully granted the writer an audience soon cut short, pronounced sentence upon him, and gave himself the comforting pleasure of repeating after every mouthful of the scalding brew: \u201cThat fellow Bergotte has become unreadable. My word, what a bore the creature can be. I really must stop my subscription. How involved it all is, bread and butter nonsense!\u201d And he helped himself to another slice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This illusory importance of M. Bloch senior did, moreover, extend some little way beyond the radius of his own perceptions. In the first place his children regarded him as a superior person. Children have always a tendency either to depreciate or to exalt their parents, and to a good son his father is always the best of fathers, quite apart from any objective reason there may be for admiring him. Now, such reasons were not altogether lacking in the case of M. Bloch, who was an educated man, shrewd, affectionate towards his family. In his most intimate circle they were all the more proud of him because, if, in \u2018society,\u2019 people are judged by a standard (which is incidentally absurd) and according to false but fixed rules, by comparison with the aggregate of all the other fashionable people, in the subdivisions of middle-class life, on the other hand, the dinners, the family parties all turn upon certain people who are pronounced good company, amusing, and who in \u2018society\u2019 would not survive a second evening. Moreover in such an environment where the artificial values of the aristocracy do not exist, their place is taken by distinctions even more stupid. Thus it was that in his family circle, and even among the remotest branches of the tree, an alleged similarity in his way of wearing his moustache and in the bridge of his nose led to M. Bloch\u2019s being called \u201cthe Due d\u2019Aumale\u2019s double.\u201d (In the world of club pages, the one who wears his cap on one side and his jacket tightly buttoned, so as to give himself the appearance, he imagines, of a foreign officer, is he not also a personage of a sort to his comrades?)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The resemblance was the faintest, but you would have said that it conferred a title. When he was mentioned, it would always be: \u201cBloch? Which one? The Due d\u2019Aumale?\u201d as people say \u201cPrincesse Mur\u00e2t? Which one? The Queen (of Naples)?\u201d And there were certain other minute marks which combined to give him, in the eyes of the cousinhood, an acknowledged claim to distinction. Not going the length of having a carriage of his own, M. Bloch used on special occasions to hire an open victoria with a pair of horses from the Company, and would drive through the Bois de Boulogne, his body sprawling limply from side to side, two fingers pressed to his brow, other two supporting his chin, and if people who did not know him concluded that he was an \u2018old nuisance,\u2019 they were all convinced, in the family, that for smartness Uncle Solomon could have taught Gramont-Caderousse a thing or two. He was one of those people who when they die, because for years they have shared a table in a restaurant on the boulevard with its news-editor, are described as \u201cwell known Paris figures\u201d in the social column of the Radical. M. Bloch told Saint-Loup and me that Bergotte knew so well why he, M. Bloch, always cut him that as soon as he caught sight of him, at the theatre or in the club, he avoided his eye. Saint-Loup blushed, for it had occurred to him that this club could not be the Jockey, of which his father had been chairman. On the other hand it must be a fairly exclusive club, for M. Bloch had said that Bergotte would never have got into it if he had come up now. So it was not without the fear that he might be \u2018underrating his adversary\u2019 that Saint-Loup asked whether the club in question were the Rue Royale, which was considered \u2018lowering\u2019 by his own family, and to which he knew that certain Israelites had been admitted. \u201cNo,\u201d replied M. Bloch in a tone at once careless, proud and ashamed, \u201cit is a small club, but far more pleasant than a big one, the Ganaches. We\u2019re very strict there, don\u2019t you know.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t Sir Rufus Israels the chairman?\u201d Bloch junior asked his father, so as to give him the opportunity for a glorious lie, never suspecting that the financier had not the same eminence in Saint-Loup\u2019s eyes as in his. The fact of the matter was that the Ganaches club boasted not Sir Rufus Israels but one of his staff. But as this man was on the best of terms with his employer, he had at his disposal a stock of the financier\u2019s cards, and would give one to M. Bloch whenever he wished to travel on a line of which Sir Rufus was a director, the result of which was that old Bloch would say: \u201cI\u2019m just going round to the Club to ask Sir Rufus for a line to the Company.\u201d And the card enabled him to dazzle the guards on the trains. The Misses Bloch were more interested in Bergotte and, reverting to him rather than pursue the subject of the Ganaches, the youngest asked her brother, in the most serious tone imaginable, for she believed that there existed in the world, for the designation of men of talent, no other terms than those which he was in the habit of using: \u201cIs he really an amazing good egg, this Bergotte? Is he in the category of the great lads, good eggs like Villiers and Catullus?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve met him several times at dress rehearsals,\u201d said M. Nissim Bernard. \u201cHe is an uncouth creature, a sort of Schlemihl.\u201d There was nothing very serious in this allusion to Chamisso\u2019s story but the epithet \u2018Schlemihl\u2019 formed part of that dialect, half-German, half-Jewish, the use of which delighted M. Bloch in the family circle, but struck him as vulgar and out of place before strangers. And so he cast a reproving glance at his uncle. \u201cHe has talent,\u201d said Bloch. \u201cAh!\u201d His sister sighed gravely, as though to imply that in that case there was some excuse for me. \u201cAll writers have talent,\u201d said M. Bloch scornfully. \u201cIn fact it appears,\u201d went on his son, raising his fork, and screwing up his eyes with an air of impish irony, \u201cthat he is going to put up for the Academy.\u201d \u201cGo on. He hasn\u2019t enough to shew them,\u201d replied his father, who seemed not to have for the Academy the same contempt as his son and daughters. \u201cHe\u2019s not big enough.\u201d \u201cBesides, the Academy is a salon, and Bergotte has no polish,\u201d declared the uncle (whose heiress Mme. Bloch was), a mild and inoffensive person whose surname, Bernard, might perhaps by itself have quickened my grandfather\u2019s powers of diagnosis, but would have appeared too little in harmony with a face which looked as if it had been brought back from Darius\u2019s palace and restored by Mme. Dieulafoy, had not (chosen by some collector desirous of giving a crowning touch of orientalism to this figure from Susa) his first name, Nissim, stretched out above it the pinions of an androcephalous bull from Khorsabad. But M. Bloch never stopped insulting his uncle, whether it was that he was excited by the unresisting good-humour of his butt, or that the rent of the villa being paid by M. Nissim Bernard, the beneficiary wished to shew that he kept his independence, and, more important still, that he was not seeking by flattery to make sure of the rich inheritance to come. What most hurt the old man was being treated so rudely in front of the manservant. He murmured an unintelligible sentence of which all that could be made out was: \u201cwhen the meschores are in the room.\u201d \u2018Meschores,\u2019 in the Bible, means \u2018the servant of God.\u2019 In the family circle the Blochs used the word when they referred to their own servants, and were always exhilarated by it, because their certainty of not being understood either by Christians or by the servants themselves enhanced in M. Nissim Bernard and M. Bloch their twofold distinction of being \u2018masters\u2019 and at the same time \u2018Jews.\u2019 But this latter source of satisfaction became a source of displeasure when there was \u2018company.\u2019 At such times M. Bloch, hearing his uncle say \u2018meschores,\u2019 felt that he was making his oriental side too prominent, just as a light-of-love who has invited some of her sisters to meet her respectable friends is annoyed if they allude to their profession or use words that do not sound quite nice. Therefore, so far from his uncle\u2019s request\u2019s producing any effect on M. Bloch, he, beside himself with rage, could contain himself no longer. He let no opportunity pass of scarifying his wretched uncle. \u201cOf course, when there is a chance of saying anything stupid, one can be quite certain that you won\u2019t miss it. You would be the first to lick his boots if he were in the room!\u201d shouted M. Bloch, while M. Nissim Bernard in sorrow lowered over his plate the ringleted beard of King Sargon. My friend, when he began to grow his beard, which also was blue-black and crimped, became very like his great-uncle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat! Are you the son of the Marquis de Marsantes? Why, I knew him very well,\u201d said M. Nissim Bernard to Saint-Loup. I supposed that he meant the word \u2018knew\u2019 in the sense in which Bloch\u2019s father had said that he knew Bergotte, namely by sight. But he went on: \u201cYour father was one of my best friends.\u201d Meanwhile Bloch had turned very red, his father was looking intensely cross, the Misses Bloch were choking with suppressed laughter. The fact was that in M. Nissim Bernard the love of ostentation which in M. Bloch and his children was held in cheek, had engendered the habit of perpetual lying. For instance, if he was staying in an hotel, M. Nissim Bernard, as M. Bloch equally might have done, would have his newspapers brought to him always by his valet in the dining-room, in the middle of luncheon, when everybody was there, so that they should see that he travelled with a valet. But to the people with whom he made friends in the hotel the uncle used to say what the nephew would never have said, that he was a Senator. He might know quite well that they would sooner or later discover that the title was usurped; he could not, at the critical moment, resist the temptation to assume it. M. Bloch suffered acutely from his uncle\u2019s lies and from all the embarrassments that they led to. \u201cDon\u2019t pay any attention to him, he talks a great deal of nonsense,\u201d he whispered to Saint-Loup, whose interest was all the more whetted, for he was curious to explore the psychology of liars. \u201cA greater liar even than the Ithacan Odysseus, albeit Athene called him the greatest liar among mortals,\u201d his son completed the indictment. \u201cWell, upon my word!\u201d cried M. Nissim Bernard, \u201cIf I\u2019d only known that I was going to sit down to dinner with my old friend\u2019s son! Why, I have a photograph still of your father at home, in Paris, and any number of letters from him. He used always to call me \u2018uncle,\u2019 nobody ever knew why. He was a charming man, sparkling. I remember so well a dinner I gave at Nice; there were Sardou, Labiche, Augier,\u201d \u201cMoli\u00e8re, Racine, Corneille,\u201d M. Bloch added with sarcasm, while his son completed the tale of guests with \u201cPlautus, Menander, Kalidasa.\u201d M. Nissim Bernard, cut to the quick, stopped short in his reminiscence, and, ascetically depriving himself of a great pleasure, remained silent until the end of dinner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSaint-Loup with helm of bronze,\u201d said Bloch, \u201chave a piece more of this duck with thighs heavy with fat, over which the illustrious sacrificer of birds has spilled numerous libations of red wine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a rule, after bringing out from his store for the entertainment of a distinguished guest his anecdotes of Sir Rufus Israels and others, M. Bloch, feeling that he had succeeded in touching and melting his son\u2019s heart, would withdraw, so as not to spoil his effect in the eyes of the \u2018big pot.\u2019 If, however, there was an absolutely compelling reason, as for instance on the night when his son won his fellowship, M. Bloch would add to the usual string of anecdotes the following ironical reflexion which he ordinarily reserved for his own personal friends, so that young Bloch was extremely proud to see it produced for his: \u201cThe Government have acted unpardonably. They have forgotten to consult M. Coquelin! M. Coquelin has let it be known that he is displeased.\u201d (M. Bloch prided himself on being a reactionary, with a contempt for theatrical people.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the Misses Bloch and their brother reddened to the tips of their ears, so much impressed were they when Bloch senior, to shew that he could be regal to the last in his entertainment of his son\u2019s two \u2018chums,\u2019 gave the order for champagne to be served, and announced casually that, as a treat for us, he had taken three stalls for the performance which a company from the Op\u00e9ra-Comique was giving that evening at the Casino. He was sorry that he had not been able to get a box. They had all been taken. However, he had often been in the boxes, and really one saw and heard better down by the orchestra. All very well, only, if the defect of his son, that is to say the defect which his son believed to be invisible to other people, was coarseness, the father\u2019s was avarice. And so it was in a decanter that we were served with, under the name of champagne, a light sparkling wine, while under that of orchestra stalls he had taken three in the pit, which cost half as much, miraculously persuaded by the divine intervention of his defect that neither at table nor in the theatre (where the boxes were all empty) would the defect be noticed. When M. Bloch had let us moisten our lips in the flat glasses which his son dignified with the style and title of \u2018craters with deeply hollowed flanks,\u2019 he made us admire a picture to which he was so much attached that he had brought it with him to Balbec. He told us that it was a Rubens. Saint-Loup asked innocently if it was signed. M. Bloch replied, blushing, that he had had the signature cut off to make it fit the frame, but that it made no difference, as he had no intention of selling the picture. Then he hurriedly bade us good-night, in order to bury himself in the Journal Officiel, back numbers of which littered the house, and which, he informed us, he was obliged to read carefully on account of his \u2018parliamentary position\u2019 as to the precise nature of which, however, he gave us no enlightenment. \u201cI shall take a muffler,\u201d said Bloch, \u201cfor Zephyrus and Boreas are disputing to which of them shall belong the fish-teeming sea, and should we but tarry a little after the show is over, we shall not be home before the first flush of Eos, the rosy-fingered. By the way,\u201d he asked Saint-Loup when we were outside, and I trembled, for I realised at once that it was of M. de Charlus that Bloch was speaking in that tone of irony, \u201cwho was that excellent old card dressed in black that I saw you walking with, the day before yesterday, on the beach?\u201d \u201cThat was my uncle.\u201d Saint-Loup was ruffled. Unfortunately, a \u2018floater\u2019 was far from seeming to Bloch a thing to be avoided. He shook with laughter. \u201cHeartiest congratulations; I ought to have guessed; he has an excellent style, the most priceless dial of an old \u2018gaga\u2019 of the highest lineage.\u201d \u201cYou are absolutely mistaken; he is an extremely clever man,\u201d retorted Saint-Loup, now furious. \u201cI am sorry about that; it makes him less complete. All the same, I should like very much to know him, for I flatter myself I could write some highly adequate pieces about old buffers like that. Just to see him go by, he\u2019s killing. But I should leave out of account the caricaturable side, which really is hardly worthy of an artist enamoured of the plastic beauty of phrases, of his mug, which (you\u2019ll forgive me) doubled me up for a moment with joyous laughter, and I should bring into prominence the aristocratic side of your uncle, who after all has a distinct bovine effect, and when one has finished laughing does impress one by his great air of style. But,\u201d he went on, addressing myself this time, \u201cthere is also a matter of a very different order about which I have been meaning to question you, and every time we are together, some god, blessed denizen of Olympus, makes me completely forget to ask for a piece of information which might before now have been and is sure some day to be of the greatest use to me. Tell me, who was the lovely lady I saw you with in the Jardin d\u2019Acclimatation accompanied by a gentleman whom I seem to know by sight and a little girl with long hair?\u201d It had been quite plain to me at the time that Mme. Swann did not remember Bloch\u2019s name, since she had spoken of him by another, and had described my friend as being on the staff of some Ministry, as to which I had never since then thought of finding out whether he had joined it. But how came it that Bloch, who, according to what she then told me, had got himself introduced to her, was ignorant of her name? I was so much surprised that I stopped for a moment before answering. \u201cWhoever she is,\u201d he went on, \u201chearty congratulations; you can\u2019t have been bored with her. I picked her up a few days before that on the Zone railway, where, speaking of zones, she was so kind as to undo hers for the benefit of your humble servant; I have never had such a time in my life, and we were just going to make arrangements to meet again when somebody she knew had the bad taste to get in at the last station but one.\u201d My continued silence did not appear to please Bloch. \u201cI was hoping,\u201d he said, \u201cthanks to you, to learn her address, so as to go there several times a week to taste in her arms the delights of Eros, dear to the gods; but I do not insist since you seem pledged to discretion with respect to a professional who gave herself to me three times running, and in the most refined manner, between Paris and the Point-du-Jour. I am bound to see her again, some night.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I called upon Bloch after this dinner; he returned my call, but I was out and he was seen asking for me by Fran\u00e7oise, who, as it happened, albeit he had visited us at Combray, had never set eyes on him until then. So that she knew only that one of \u2018the gentlemen\u2019 who were friends of mine had looked in to see me, she did not know \u2018with what object,\u2019 dressed in a nondescript way, which had not made any particular impression upon her. Now though I knew quite well that certain of Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s social ideas must for ever remain impenetrable by me, ideas based, perhaps, partly upon confusions between words, between names which she had once and for all time mistaken for one another, I could not restrain myself, who had long since abandoned the quest for enlightenment in such cases, from seeking \u2014 and seeking, moreover, in vain \u2014 to discover what could be the immense significance that the name of Bloch had for Fran\u00e7oise. For no sooner had I mentioned to her that the young man whom she had seen was M. Bloch than she recoiled several paces, so great were her stupor and disappointment. \u201cWhat! Is that M. Bloch?\u201d she cried, thunderstruck, as if so portentous a personage ought to have been endowed with an appearance which \u2018made you know\u2019 as soon as you saw him that you were in the presence of one of the great ones of the earth; and, like some one who has discovered that an historical character is not \u2018up to\u2019 the level of his reputation, she repeated in an impressed tone, in which I could detect latent, for future growth, the seeds of a universal scepticism: \u201cWhat! Is that M. Bloch? Well, really, you would never think it, to look at him.\u201d She seemed also to bear me a grudge, as if I had always \u2018overdone\u2019 the praise of Bloch to her. At the same time she was kind enough to add: \u201cWell, he may be M. Bloch, and all that. I\u2019m sure Master can say he\u2019s every bit as good.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had presently, with respect to Saint-Loup, whom she worshipped, a disillusionment of a different kind and of less severity: she discovered that he was a Republican. Now for all that, when speaking, for instance, of the Queen of Portugal, she would say with that disrespect which is, among the people, the supreme form of respect: \u201cAm\u00e9lie, Philippe\u2019s sister,\u201d Fran\u00e7oise was a Royalist. But when it came to a Marquis; a Marquis who had dazzled her at first sight, and who was for the Republic, seemed no longer real. And she shewed the same ill-humour as if I had given her a box which she had believed to be made of gold, and had thanked me for it effusively, and then a jeweller had revealed to her that it was only plated. She at once withdrew her esteem from Saint-Loup, but soon afterwards restored it to him, having reflected that he could not, being the Marquis de Saint-Loup, be a Republican, that he was just pretending, in his own interest, for with such a Government as we had it might be a great advantage to him. From that moment her coldness towards him, her resentment towards myself ceased. And when she spoke of Saint-Loup she said: \u201cHe is a hypocrite,\u201d with a broad and friendly smile which made it clear that she \u2018considered\u2019 him again just as much as when she first knew him, and that she had forgiven him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact, Saint-Loup was absolutely sincere and disinterested, and it was this intense moral purity which, not being able to find entire satisfaction in a selfish sentiment such as love, nor on the other hand meeting in him the impossibility (which existed in me, for instance) of finding its spiritual nourishment elsewhere than in himself, rendered him truly capable (just as I was incapable) of friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise was no less mistaken about Saint-Loup when she complained that he had that sort of air, as if he did not look down upon the people, but that it was all just a pretence, and you had only to see him when he was in a temper with his groom. It had indeed sometimes happened that Robert would scold his groom with a certain amount of brutality, which proved that he had the sense not so much of the difference as of the equality between classes and masses. \u201cBut,\u201d he said in answer to my rebuke of his having treated the man rather harshly, \u201cwhy should I go out of my way to speak politely to him? Isn\u2019t he my equal? Isn\u2019t he just as near to me as any of my uncles and cousins? You seem to think that I ought to treat him with respect, as an inferior. You talk like an aristocrat!\u201d he added scornfully\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And indeed if there was a class to which he shewed himself prejudiced and hostile, it was the aristocracy, so much so that he found it as hard to believe in the superior qualities of a man in society as he found it easy to believe in those of a man of the people. When I mentioned the Princesse de Luxembourg, whom I had met with his aunt:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAn old trout,\u201d was his comment. \u201cLike all that lot. She\u2019s a sort of cousin of mine, by the way.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having a strong prejudice against the people who frequented it, he went rarely into \u2018Society,\u2019 and the contemptuous or hostile attitude which he adopted towards it served to increase, among all his near relatives, the painful impression made by his intimacy with a woman on the stage, a connexion which, they declared, would be his ruin, blaming it specially for having bred in him that spirit of denigration, that bad spirit, and for having led him astray, after which it was only a matter of time before he would have dropped out altogether. And so, many easy-going men of the Faubourg Saint-Germain were without compunction when they spoke of Robert\u2019s mistress. \u201cThose girls do their job,\u201d they would say, \u201cthey are as good as anybody else. But that one; no, thank youl We cannot forgive her. She has done too much harm to a fellow we were fond of.\u201d Of course, he was not the first to be caught in that snare. But the others amused themselves like men of the world, continued to think like men of the world about politics, about everything. As for him, his family found him \u2018soured.\u2019 They did not bear in mind that, for many young men of fashion who would otherwise remain uncultivated mentally, rough in their friendships, without gentleness or taste \u2014 it is very often their mistress who is their real master, and connexions of this sort the only school of morals in which they are initiated into a superior culture, and learn the value of disinterested relations. Even among the lower orders (who, when it comes to coarseness, so often remind us of the world of fashion) the woman, more sensitive, finer, more leisured, is driven by curiosity to adopt certain refinements, respects certain beauties of sentiment and of art which, though she may fail to understand them, she nevertheless places above what has seemed most desirable to the man, above money or position. Now whether the mistress be a young blood\u2019s (such as Saint-Loup) or a young workman\u2019s (electricians, for instance, must now be included in our truest order of Chivalry) her lover has too much admiration and respect for her not to extend them also to what she herself respects and admires; and for him the scale of values is thereby reversed. Her sex alone makes her weak; she suffers from nervous troubles, inexplicable things which in a man, or even in another woman \u2014 a woman whose nephew or cousin he was \u2014 would bring a smile to the lips of this stalwart young man. But he cannot bear to see her suffer whom he loves. The young nobleman who, like Saint-Loup, has a mistress acquires the habit, when he takes her out to dine, of carrying in his pocket the valerian \u2018drops\u2019 which she may need, of ordering the waiter, firmly and with no hint of sarcasm, to see that he shuts the doors quietly and not to put any damp moss on the table, so as to spare his companion those discomforts which himself he has never felt, which compose for him an occult world in whose reality she has taught him to believe, discomforts for which he now feels pity without in the least needing to understand them, for which he will still feel pity when other women than she shall be the sufferers. Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress \u2014 as the first monks of the middle ages taught Christendom \u2014 had taught him to be kind to animals, for which she had a passion, never moving without her dog, her canaries, her love-birds; Saint-Loup looked after them with motherly devotion and treated as brutes the people who were not good to dumb creatures. On the other hand, an actress, or so-called actress, like this one who was living with him \u2014 whether she were intelligent or not, and as to that I had no knowledge \u2014 by making him find the society of fashionable women boring, and look upon having to go out to a party as a painful duty, had saved him from snobbishness and cured him of frivolity. If, thanks to her, his social engagements filled a smaller place in the life of her young lover, at the same time, whereas if he had been simply a drawing-room man, vanity or self-interest would have dictated his choice of friends as rudeness would have characterised his treatment of them, his mistress had taught him to bring nobility and refinement into his friendship. With her feminine instinct, with a keener appreciation in men of certain qualities of sensibility which her lover might perhaps, without her guidance, have misunderstood and laughed at, she had always been swift to distinguish from among the rest of Saint-Loup\u2019s friends, the one who had a real affection for him, and to make that one her favourite. She knew how to make him feel grateful to such a friend, shew his gratitude, notice what things gave his friend pleasure and what pain. And presently Saint-Loup, without any more need of her to prompt him, began to think of all these things by himself, and at Balbec, where she was not with him, for me whom she had never seen, whom he had perhaps not yet so much as mentioned in his letters to her, of his own accord would pull up the window of a carriage in which I was sitting, take out of the room the flowers that made me feel unwell, and when he had to say good-bye to several people at once manage to do so before it was actually time for him to go, so as to be left alone and last with me, to make that distinction between them and me, to treat me differently from the rest. His mistress had opened his mind to the invisible, had brought a serious element into his life, delicacy into his heart, but all this escaped his sorrowing family who repeated: \u201cThat creature will be the death of him; meanwhile she\u2019s doing what she can to disgrace him.\u201d It is true that he had succeeded in getting out of her all the good that she was capable of doing him; and that she now caused him only incessant suffering, for she had taken an intense dislike to him and tormented him in every possible way. She had begun, one fine day, to look upon him as stupid and absurd because the friends that she had among the younger writers and actors had assured her that he was, and she duly repeated what they had said with that passion, that want of reserve which we shew whenever we receive from without and adopt as our own opinions or customs of which we previously knew nothing. She readily professed, like her actor friends, that between Saint-Loup and herself there was a great gulf fixed, and not to be crossed, because they were of different races, because she was an intellectual and he, whatever he might pretend, the born enemy of the intellect. This view of him seemed to her profound, and she sought confirmation of it in the most insignificant words, the most trivial actions of her lover. But when the same friends had further convinced her that she was destroying, in company so ill-suited to her, the great hopes which she had, they said, aroused in them, that her lover would leave a mark on her, that by living with him she was spoiling her future as an artist; to her contempt for Saint-Loup was added the same hatred that she would have felt for him if he had insisted upon inoculating her with a deadly germ. She saw him as seldom as possible, at the same time postponing the hour of a definite rupture, which seemed to me a highly improbable event. Saint-Loup made such sacrifices for her that unless she was ravishingly beautiful (but he had always refused to shew me her photograph, saying: \u201cFor one thing, she\u2019s not a beauty, and besides she always takes badly. These are only some snapshots that I took myself with my kodak; they would give you a wrong idea of her.\u201d) it would surely be difficult for her to find another man who would consent to anything of the sort. I never reflected that a certain obsession to make a name for oneself, even when one has no talent, that the admiration, no more than the privately expressed admiration of people who are imposing on one, can (although it may not perhaps have been the case with Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress) be, even for a little prostitute, motives more determining than the pleasure of making money. Saint-Loup who, without quite understanding what was going on in the mind of his mistress, did not believe her to be completely sincere either in her unfair reproaches or in her promises of undying love, had all the same at certain moments the feeling that she would break with him whenever she could, and accordingly, impelled no doubt by the instinct of self-preservation which was part of his love, a love more clear-sighted, possibly, than Saint-Loup himself, making use, too, of a practical capacity for business which was compatible in him with the loftiest and blindest flights of the heart, had refused to settle upon her any capital, had borrowed an enormous sum so that she should want nothing, but made it over to her only from day to day. And no doubt, assuming that she really thought of leaving him, she was calmly waiting until she had feathered her nest, a process which, with the money given her by Saint-Loup, would not perhaps take very long, but would all the same require a time which must be conceded to prolong the happiness of my new friend \u2014 or his misery\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This dramatic period of their connexion, which had now reached its most acute stage, the most cruel for Saint-Loup, for she had forbidden him to remain in Paris, where his presence exasperated her, and had forced him to spend his leave at Balbec, within easy reach of his regiment \u2014 had begun one evening at the house of one of Saint-Loup\u2019s aunts, on whom he had prevailed to allow his friend to come there, before a large party, to recite some of the speeches from a symbolical play in which she had once appeared in an \u2018advanced\u2019 theatre, and for which she had made him share the admiration that she herself professed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But when she appeared in the room, with a large lily in her hand, and wearing a costume copied from the Ancilla Domini, which she had persuaded Saint-Loup was an absolute \u2018vision of beauty,\u2019 her entrance had been greeted, in that assemblage of clubmen and duchesses, with smiles which the monotonous tone of her chantings, the oddity of certain words and their frequent recurrence had changed into fits of laughter, stifled at first but presently so uncontrollable that the wretched reciter had been unable to go on. Next day Saint-Loup\u2019s aunt had been universally censured for having allowed so grotesque an actress to appear in her drawing-room. A well-known duke made no bones about telling her that she had only herself to blame if she found herself criticised. \u201cDamn it all, people really don\u2019t come to see \u2018turns\u2019 like that! If the woman had talent, even; but she has none and never will have any. \u2018Pon my soul, Paris is not such a fool as people make out. Society does not consist exclusively of imbeciles. This little lady evidently believed that she was going to take Paris by surprise. But Paris is not so easily surprised as all that, and there are still some things that they can\u2019t make us swallow.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the actress, she left the house with Saint-Loup, exclaiming: \u201cWhat do you mean by letting me in for those geese, those uneducated bitches, those dirty corner-boys? I don\u2019t mind telling you, there wasn\u2019t a man in the room who didn\u2019t make eyes at me or squeeze my foot, and it was because I wouldn\u2019t look at them that they were out for revenge.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Words which had changed Robert\u2019s antipathy for people in society into a horror that was at once deep and distressing, and was provoked in him most of all by those who least deserved it, devoted kinsmen who, on behalf of the family, had sought to persuade Saint-Loup\u2019s lady to break with him, a move which she represented to him as inspired by their passion for her. Robert, although he had at once ceased to see them, used to imagine when he was parted from his mistress as he was now, that they or others like them were profiting by his absence to return to the charge and had possibly prevailed over her. And when he spoke of the sensualists who were disloyal to their friends, who sought to seduce their friends\u2019 wives, tried to make them come to houses of assignation, his whole face would glow with suffering and hatred\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI would kill them with less compunction than I would kill a dog, which is at least a well-behaved beast, and loyal and faithful. There are men who deserve the guillotine if you like, far more than poor wretches who have been led into crime by poverty and by the cruelty of the rich.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He spent the greater part of his time in sending letters and telegrams to his mistress. Every time that, while still preventing him from returning to Paris, she found an excuse to quarrel with him by post, I read the news at once in his evident discomposure. Inasmuch as his mistress never told him what fault she found with him, suspecting that possibly if she did not tell him it was because she did not know herself, and simply had had enough of him, he would still have liked an explanation and used to write to her: \u201cTell me what I have done wrong. I am quite ready to acknowledge my faults,\u201d the grief that overpowered him having the effect of persuading him that he had behaved badly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she kept him waiting indefinitely for her answers which, when they did come, were meaningless. And so it was almost always with a furrowed brow, and often with empty hands that I would see Saint-Loup returning from the post office, where, alone in all the hotel, he and Fran\u00e7oise went to fetch or to hand in letters, he from a lover\u2019s impatience, she with a servant\u2019s mistrust of others. (His telegrams obliged him to take a much longer journey.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, some days after our dinner with the Blochs, my grandmother told me with a joyful air that Saint-Loup had just been asking her whether, before he left Balbec, she would not like him to take a photograph of her, and when I saw that she had put on her nicest dress on purpose, and was hesitating between several of her best hats, I felt a little annoyed by this childishness, which surprised me coming from her. I even went the length of asking myself whether I had not been mistaken in my grandmother, whether I did not esteem her too highly, whether she was as unconcerned as I had always supposed in the adornment of her person, whether she had not indeed the very weakness that I believed most alien to her temperament, namely coquetry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, this displeasure that I derived from the prospect of a photographic \u2018sitting,\u2019 and more particularly from the satisfaction with which my grandmother appeared to be looking forward to it, I made so apparent that Fran\u00e7oise remarked it and did her best, unintentionally, to increase it by making me a sentimental, gushing speech, by which I refused to appear moved\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Master; my poor Madame will be so pleased at having her likeness taken, she is going to wear the hat that her old Fran\u00e7oise has trimmed for her, you must allow her, Master.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I acquired the conviction that I was not cruel in laughing at Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s sensibility, by reminding myself that my mother and grandmother, my models in all things, often did the same. But my grandmother, noticing that I seemed cross, said that if this plan of her sitting for her photograph offended me in any way she would give it up. I would not let her; I assured her that I saw no harm in it, and left her to adorn herself, but, thinking that I shewed my penetration and strength of mind, I added a few stinging words of sarcasm, intended to neutralize the pleasure which she seemed to find in being photographed, so that if I was obliged to see my grandmother\u2019s magnificent hat, I succeeded at least in driving from her face that joyful expression which ought to have made me glad; but alas, it too often happens, while the people we love best are still alive, that such expressions appear to us as the exasperating manifestation of some unworthy freak of fancy rather than as the precious form of the happiness which we should dearly like to procure for them. My ill-humour arose more particularly from the fact that, during the last week, my grandmother had appeared to be avoiding me, and I had not been able to have her to myself for a moment, either by night or day. When I came back in the afternoon to be alone with her for a little I was told that she was not in the hotel; or else she would shut herself up with Fran\u00e7oise for endless confabulations which I was not permitted to interrupt. And when, after being out all evening with Saint-Loup, I had been thinking on the way home of the moment at which I should be able to go to my grandmother and to kiss her, in vain might I wait for her to knock on the partition between us the three little taps which would tell me to go in and say good night to her; I heard nothing; at length I would go to bed, a little resentful of her for depriving me, with an indifference so new and strange in her, of a joy on which I had so much counted, I would lie still for a while, my heart throbbing as in my childhood, listening to the wall which remained silent, until I cried myself to sleep1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1087715", "artist_names": "Johnny Crawford", "full_title": "Proud by\u00a0Johnny\u00a0Crawford", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "id": 1087715, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429627056, "path": "/Johnny-crawford-proud-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Johnny-crawford-proud-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "song_art_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Proud", "title_with_featured": "Proud", "updated_by_human_at": 1436290876, "url": "https://genius.com/Johnny-crawford-proud-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/378465", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669754445", "id": 378465, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669754445", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Johnny Crawford", "slug": "Johnny-crawford", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Johnny-crawford"}, "artist": "Johnny Crawford", "lyrics": "Proud LyricsWe had a quarrel the other day\nAnd I just let you walk away\n'Cause I was proud\nSo proud and strong\nYes I was much too proud to say I was wrong\n\nYou turned back crying and called to me\nBut I just stood there silently\n'Cause I was proud\nSo proud and strong\nYes I was much too proud to say I was wrong\nSome other guy might have crawled to you\nAnd said don't go, I need you so\nBut I wouldn't do it\nNo, I couldn't do it\nAnd so I let you say good-bye\nAnd I was proud to let you cry\nProud I held my head up high\nAnd now I'm just a proud and lonely guyYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 9, "api_path": "/songs/2264085", "artist_names": "John Smoltz", "full_title": "Hall of Fame Induction Speech by\u00a0John\u00a0Smoltz", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/cbe0a96795ecf58adab5269a60d13390.300x169x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/cbe0a96795ecf58adab5269a60d13390.1000x563x1.jpg", "id": 2264085, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1860517, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1438735611, "path": "/John-smoltz-hall-of-fame-induction-speech-annotated", "pyongs_count": 6, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/John-smoltz-hall-of-fame-induction-speech-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2015, "month": 7, "day": 26}, "release_date_for_display": "July 26, 2015", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jul. 26, 2015", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/7636777550301c399c996ab16c4f2221.300x326x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/7636777550301c399c996ab16c4f2221.640x696x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Hall of Fame Induction Speech", "title_with_featured": "Hall of Fame Induction Speech", "updated_by_human_at": 1469442233, "url": "https://genius.com/John-smoltz-hall-of-fame-induction-speech-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/540300", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669754445", "id": 540300, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669754445", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "John Smoltz", "slug": "John-smoltz", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/John-smoltz"}, "artist": "John Smoltz", "lyrics": "Hall of Fame Induction Speech LyricsWow, I hope you're ready for a wild ride, cause I'm gonna warm you up for Pedro and Randy and you never know what's gonna be coming, so this is truly a treat and I want to talk about four significant phone calls in my life. The first was getting drafted by the Detroit Tigers. A dream that a hometown kid would have. The second one was not the best of phone calls, it was getting traded by the Detroit Tigers to the Atlanta Braves, the worst team in all of baseball at the time.\n\nThe third was very significant and I will touch on it later, but it was a call from Tommy John, encouraging me to continue with my career at the age of thirty-four. The fourth call is not something I ever dreamed about. I don't know, I can't speak for the rest of the Hall of Famers, but on January Sixth when I got the call letting me know that I had been inducted into the Hall of Fame, well words and emotions could not describe. The phone rang, I was just thankful that Greg Maddux had not put up the ultimate prank in letting me know that this was not for real. Thankfully they told me quickly that I had made it.\n\nSo I truly want to thank the Hall of Fame, Jane Forbes Clark and Jeff Idelson, for what they've done in preserve the character of this great Hall. For Brad Horn, for Whitney,  all the people behind the scenes making this like the perfect wedding, orchestrating it to the fullest. And of course the baseball writers of America. Your votes obviously got me to this point, I cannot thank you enough.\n\nTo Randy, Pedro, and Craig: I will never forget this class. It is a class that I have had the utmost respect for each and every one of them. Of course Craig I've competed the most against. It's hard to believe that I've never competed against Randy Johnson, I can't say that I'm sorry. But I don't think we ever hooked up.\n\nI had a seat in the bullpen when he pitched his perfect game as I was the closer for the Braves and actually half-heartedly started to warm up in the ninth cause it was only a two to nothing game knowing full well I didn't think I was gonna get in that game. But at 6' 10\", he is truly the freak that mastered a game in a way that no other could. And in a weird way, with Pedro Martinez being on the opposite end of the spectrum and me kinda fit in the middle at six-foot-three, it shows why baseball is a game of all sizes and shapes, and why it is truly America's pastime.\n\nCraig's the teammate that you always wanted and the guy you never wanted to play against. And Pedro, you got me in a lot of trouble facing you in my career. You were the most dominant pitcher I'd ever seen. It was Bugs Bunny, and in today's world it was basically Nintendo or any kind of game you watch - that's the kind of stuff you had. I got fined a hundred dollars for check-swinging and hurting my wrist against you, and... thanks a lot.\nWell, I'm gonna try to do it backwards. I'm gonna do the tough part first. And I never thought I'd ever read a speech, but for the sake of time I'm going to. I want you to know that the best way to describe my career is unique. I can't think of another word. It's unique in every way, and I have fingerprints all over my career by those who've touched me and impacted me and have helped me along the way. It is a huge army that got John Smoltz from Lansing, Michigan to where I am today.\n\nI'm not gonna touch on all of them, I'm gonna do that in a personal way. There's too many people to thank, and I know that I will forget  somebody but I will take care of you on the back end, I promise. But I will be talking about some who made it possible to reach this dream.\n\nTo my wife Kathryn, the hardest thing to do is when we met six years ago, is transition from a baseball career to retirement. As Craig mentioned, this life is a great life but a cruel life, a tough one. And you made that transition so seamless, I can't even thank you enough. You took a blended family, and you made them seem like your own. You love my kids as if they were your own. You saw me at my worst, trying to make a comeback with the Boston Red Sox after major shoulder surgery. And I truly could not have made it without you. Everything you did for this event, it's not possible, I'm letting you know right now. There's too many moving parts. I love you so much, you're where my place of comfort and peace really is. And I look forward to the future as a retired, well - broadcaster for the MLB Network as we transition our career.\n\nTo my kids Andrew, Rachel, Carly, and Kelly. I can't tell you what it's like for the journey of a major league player, you sacrifice so much. I love you very much. You've adjusted and adapted to the challenges in our life. It's not the perfect road, we knew it wouldn't be, and I've always tried to give you the best of what I had. I can't wait to see what God has for each and every one of you as you pursue your passions. Although be unique, they are your own. And I can't wait to see the families that you are able to raise as well.\n\nTo Sarah Catherine and Ashley, my two step-daughters. Can't imagine what you two were thinking when your mom and I got married and you were starting a whole new journey. Your willingness to adapt under twists and turns and your ability to just go with the flow. It seems like we've been meant to be together our whole lives. I can't thank you and know how much I love you guys.\n\nTo my mom and dad, this is where the story gets interesting. You did so much for me to get me to this point. You didn't know much about sports or baseball. You pretty much knew what you knew and that was playing the accordion cause that's how you guys met. You were accordion teachers, and I'm thankful for the opportunity that you started me on my quest to be the next Lawrence Welk at the age of four. I played till the age of seven, and then I hit you with the ultimate whopper of all whoppers at the age of seven. I said I know what I'm gonna be in life and I'm gonna be a Major League Baseball player.\n\nYou loved me enough to give me room to go after my dream. You didn't discourage me from leaving the accordion for Major League Baseball. You just told me to have a backup dream. And I did that as well. Even though it was a gas station attendant at the time, I thought that was pretty cool. I cannot imagine the odds and the way you must have felt when I told you that I was going to play in Major League Baseball. These things might have caused you to sway me in a different direction. But you not only allowed me to pursue this newfound passion of mine, you went on a mission to provide opportunities, to give me an opportunity to play this great game of baseball.\n\nYou served as a great example for me and all future parents that when your kid has a dream, no matter how outrageous or outlandish it might be, giving them a chance to pursue that is the greatest thing in life, and you put aside your own- what you knew, and what you thought would fall in the family line of tradition of great accordion players, and I can't thank you enough.\n\nI'm proud... I'm proud of the way I grew up, the heritage in which we grew up, the polka music on the 8-track tapes, I enjoyed it all. You taught me so much to not be afraid of who I am, to live in the moment, to learn, to laugh, to cry. You gave me the characteristics and the morals by which today I live by, and I am so thankful.\n\nDad, you caught me my competitiveness. Your unwillingness to let me win at the age of four and five was relentless, but I thought it was great cause I could return the favor when I had a chance to. You taught me to honor God first, family second, school third, and sports fourth. You put the priorities where they needed to be and you stood by them. I thank you for that.\n\nTo my brother and sister, I can't thank you enough for sacrificing your summers. Thankfully we didn't grow up in Florida or warm weather where you fall prey to playing every day or all year. Two months in Michigan's long enough. But you sacrificed a lot more and your love for me, one year apart, a close-knit family, following my twenty-one year career, you there there at every turn and every time I needed you the most.\n\nMy extended family is the biggest army in the world and I can't thank them enough because of everything we did. It was close-knit, we had a blast. Yes, it always involved playing the accordion and dancing. One of the things I didn't ever do was dance, but I played the accordion and I can't thank you enough for the love that you have and I could not possibly repay you all.\n\nTo my extended family again, to my in-laws for just jumping on this ride and not knowing exactly what you're gonna get. This is a pretty cool ending so far, in the midst of my journey.\nNow, my baseball journey began outside our home in Lansing, Michigan. I got a unique story, I already told you about the accordion. But I had a wild imagination. And before I go any further, Jeff Foxworthy, I'm not gonna tell any corny jokes, so relax, I could see you tense up as we speak right now. Relax, no jokes.\n\nI started with a rubber ball and a brick wall. For those who know me, this will not come as a surprise. I was the GM, the manager, the pitching coach, the grounds crew, the play-by-play, you name it, in my mind I did it. And I would stand outside that wall in a generous strike zone and I would pitch the greatest games ever known to mankind. I'm a self-taught baseball player, I'm a Tiger fanatic growing up, and so I would watch somebody and emulate them immediately outdoors. Thankfully I did not have the technology that exists today that kinda distracts our attention to get outside and do that which we love.\n\nI'm also happy to say that in all those big games that I pitched in my life, I won them all. I truly believed that if the moment were to get there, I would be a little kid on the mound, relishing in the fact that I get to do this. Cause I've already done it in my mind so many different times.\n\nGrowing up in Lansing was incredible, it's where my baseball career kinda took off. I had my best friend Chuck Catsparella, who we did everything together. We thought of games, we went outside, we were constantly doing whatever it took. For a lot of you in the stands that are not old enough you might not know what Strikeout is, but we played a lot of Strikeout and pickup baseball, and games that I'll never forget.\n\nAside from my family and Chuck, a guy that I call my second dad and I owe just a great gratitude to, could not make it today, he's at home in Lansing, Michigan hopefully watching, Carl Wagner. Dedicated over fifty years of his baseball life teaching and honoring kids, over fifty years he provided the opportunity for kids to go out and play the great game of baseball. He taught me to never be complacent, never think you've arrived, cause there's always somebody working harder, and trying to take your job and be better than you are. I can't thank you enough, Carl, and I love you.\n\nTwo other significant people from Lansing real quick, Javier Cavazos, same thing. Dedicates his life to teaching youths all over Lansing, and he has been a big influence on me, putting me in situations. And he may be one of the few people that I have been as a coach will understand, Pedro Martinez.\n\nBecause he told me at a game in Brooklyn, New York facing Brooklyn, New York where I gave up four two-run homers in a row in the fourth inning, one of the greatest moments in my life of learning. I'm not afraid to fail, and I learned from some of the greatest failure moments in my life. In Brooklyn, New York they were all yelling at me in Spanish. He came out and he said, \"You wanna know what they said?\" I said, \"Yeah, you might as well tell me as you're taking me out.\" He said, \"They were yelling to get [?] for your neck cause every time you threw a pitch you turned around and it was over the fence.\" Thank you Javier for your humility as well as your ability to teach kids.\n\nFor Phil Odlum, my high school and basketball coach, I had the two greatest years of my life. What you're gonna know about me is that I loved every minute of my life of where I grew up and where it ends, and where it's going. And Phil Odlum, you gave me the keys to lead a basketball or baseball team that I would take later and pursue that in my big league quest to be the best baseball player but the best teammate I possibly can.\n\nTo start with the draft, I gotta thank the Tigers for drafting me in the twenty-second round. I think I'm the latest draft pick to ever be in the Hall of Fame. And if it were not for the scouts, they're the backbone of our game, for seeing what I had and the motor that was ticking inside the 6' 3\", 180-pound skinny kid, this all would not be possible.\n\nDrafted by my hometown team was a dream come true as I said. I had a unique situation where I got drafted the last day before you go to college. Imagine getting drafted and going to the team you idolize and staying with them for 35 days in the big leagues. I got a chance to see what big leaguer life was- instead of going to rookie ball I went right with the big club, and got a chance to see what the heroes of my generation were doing in their locker room, in their home.\n\nAnd I gotta say this: as odd, and as in awe as I was of these guys, I remember sitting in the locker room at Tiger Stadium, a fish out of water, scared to death. And a Hall of Famer in my mind, a guy that I will never forget in making the first impression in my big league career. Alan Trammell came up to me and said, \"Hi, I am Alan Trammell. Anything I can do for you, don't hesitate to ask. This house is your house.\" And I will never forget. I thank you, Alan Trammell, for teaching me what a professional baseball player is all about.\n\nIt was as if he had introduced and gave me a baton and said now pay this forward every chance you can, because this game has a chance to impact a lot of people. And I have done that to the best of my ability thanks to Alan Trammell's imprint in my life. Just that five to twenty second time of his day he took to welcome a newcomer to the game.\n\nI also want to thank a good friend of mine, Bruce Fields, taking me into an instructional league. Right after big leagues I went into an instructional league and I worked, 6' 3\", 185. I went into the home of three veterans and they helped nurture me for the big leagues that I was about to take on that quest. And thanks to his wife Julie, they put twenty pounds on me, that instructional league that I desperately needed.\nNow onto the trade. The trade, the most infamous trade I guess in Atlanta Braves history. I can't spend enough time talking about this gentleman. I will hear about it later, I know, from the fellow Hall of Famers that I respect but Bobby Cox is every single thing to me on why I stand up here today.\n\nHe was the general manager that took the chance and made the trade and got me over to Atlanta. And yes they were the worst team in baseball at the time. It was the most devastating time in my life but I realized that I would have an opportunity to pitch at a young age in an organization that desperately needed pitching.\n\nI also used to only think about that trade as myself and what it did for me and Tom Glavine reminded me that that trade opened up a spot for him in the big leagues, and he never looked back. So I'm thankful that two-for-one worked out really well.\n\nBobby became my manager, he's the reason that I stayed in the organization for twenty years, I would rather go nowhere else. As I said time does not permit to tell you what an incredible manager- the history that I was able to watch. He empowered people, he gave you confidence when you didn't have it, he was a tremendous leader, and I owe a great amount of my career to this man.\n\nBecause of the faith that he had in me was the reason that I was able to make the transition from starter to closer, and then back to starter. He believed in everything that I did, he knew my personality. He allowed me to play golf, which always puts a smile on my face, and it's the reason that the three of us were able to play for as long as we did.\n\nThe starting rotation will be talked about for the rest of time and maybe always compared to things, but to do something and to make it come full circle. To talk about the two greatest teammates, the two greatest pitchers who got inducted, as I was sitting at the MLB Network watching them absolutely rip me a new one and enjoying every second of it, I thought we would go back in time and just do this for a second.\n\n[Puts on a wig.]\n\nGlav, Maddux, back when I had hair, we had the time of our lives. It's the only time, Greg, you're not going to be able to talk about my bald head. So what I want to talk about is the time that we had both playing golf and pitching. What you don't know about Greg and Tom is that you know that all the statistics got him here and they got them here for the Hall of Fame. But they did things behind the scenes for me that I will never, ever forget.\n\nWhen I lost my changeup they were there helping me to find it. When I lost my golf book, which was the prized treasure of what I had because I was the golf concierge, they looked tirelessly and helped me find it. Recently I've lost twenty pounds, and they helped me find it. Thank you guys.\n\n[Takes off wig.]\n\nI cannot say enough about them and as time permits, obviously you know how much we have been together: Tommy for fifteen years and Greg for ten. To Chipper Jones, soon to be inducted in the Hall of Fame, another one of the Atlanta Braves. I'm not gonna say anything about him because he'll have the mic last. Would somebody please steal his Twitter account, please. That would help.\n\nThanks to all the trainers who worked so hard, I'm a miracle, I'm a medical miracle that stands before you today. I spent more time in the training room, I can't thank them for their patience, I know I drove them crazy. Dave Pursley, Jeff Porter, Jim Lovell, and everybody else that had a hand in my career. I can't thank you all enough, and like I said I hope to one day be able to give you something special.\n\nTo Chris Burnham, Peter Hughes, you were invaluable in my career, and crucial for the day-to-day, what it took to get to the mound. To all the doctors in Atlanta, I spent a lot of time counseling with you and seeing how it was gonna be possible to throw another pitch.\n\nBut one doctor I spent the most time, and the most passionate doctor as Tommy said last year and even Greg, Dr. Joe Chandler, there is no possible way that I could have done this without you, I can't thank you enough. You are everything that I could ask for in your profession. You watched the medical miracle keep existing. We had many times at your house, in your office, and I can't thank you enough for the time that you spent with me. It's invaluable.\n\nTo all the pitching coaches that I had, I had roving pitching coaches in Detroit, John Hiller and Ralph Treuel, thank you for bearing with the wild stallion. Thank you to Bruce Dal Canton, my first pitching coach. And then Roger McDowell of course, but my first encounter of Leo Mazzone was when I came over from the Detroit Tigers in the trade. He helped simplify my mechanics, simplify my ability to pitch. And with the throwing program that we were able to use over the last fifteen years of our career is the reason why we stayed so healthy. Thank you, Leo, for your patience and for your diligence in seeing something through and making it work.\n\nTo my good friend Greg Olson, who's here today. We hit it off right away, on the field and off. His upbeat attitude helped me get through so many of my tough games. I'll never forget him jumping in my arms against the Astros, sorry Greg, and the first time we were able to get to the playoffs. And he jumped into my arms, I never anticipated after going nine innings and he was pretty heavy but at that time he felt pretty light.\n\nWe got a chance to do it again in Game 7 after the unbelievable game of Steve Avery, 1-nothing gem in Pittsburgh. He jumped in my arms again and we were on to the World Series. This all happening after a 2-11 first start, and then Bobby's patience and faith of a 12-2 second half allowed this all to be possible. We never planned it, but however we were working on the trifecta in Game 7 against Jack Morris. We were one run away from that happening, it didn't happen, my idol growing up, Jack Morris ruined that incredible opportunity to have three times, you jumping in my arms. Thank you Oley for all that you did and what we continue to do in our friendship.\n\nAnd all the catchers that I've had. I was not an easy person to catch. I can't thank them enough for their willingness to get me through a game. To Brian McCann, breaking him in, and now with the New York Yankees. It truly was a privilege to teach him what I had learned from a lot of the other catchers in our game.\n\nTo all my teammates, I can't name you enough, I thank you for what it was that we had in an incredible run. My goal in life was to be the teammate that I possibly can. That meant caring for you on and off the field, being their for you, doing my best to be prepared, laughing, joking, golfing, whatever it took. I cared about each and every one of them, that was our family away from our family, and we spent a lot of times and good times together.\n\nA special thanks to the greatest center fielder that I've ever seen in Andruw Jones. Andruw Jones caught more fly balls that I threw than probably anybody else, and he was truly a pleasure to play behind.\n\nTo the Atlanta Braves organization, to wear this great uniform, and represent the great state of Georgia, I never took one day for granted. Wearing this uniform, I played every game as if it was my last. The Braves uniform became such a platform for not only your foundation, but my later foundation that I formed in the charities that we are able to touch. I can't wait to represent these organizations in the future as now representing the greatest team behind me in the Hall of Fame.\n\nA special thank you to the Boston Red Sox for taking a chance on a broken-down guy recovering from a shoulder surgery, I can't thank you for that experience. Giving me another opportunity, although I did not do very well, I am so sorry for that. But giving me that opportunity, you showed me what another organization's view is like and the rich history that you had.\n\nTo the Saint Louis Cardinals, I will never thank you for giving me that chance after being released by the Boston Red Sox, and deservingly so by the way. For giving me an opportunity to end my career in what was an improbable and unbelievable fifteenth playoff season. For Tony La Russa,  I can't thank you for making me feel like one of your own, and entrusting me with the ball in some of the big moments. I will never forget these two organizations, because I would retire after wearing the Cardinals uniform in 2009.\n\nLast but not least, I want to steal a little bit of what- I think Craig Biggio saw my speech, I wanted to thank the clubhouse guys. They are the heart and soul of our team. They are the heart and soul of every junk that we bring to them, and I watch these kids grow up from kids to adults to now having families. It started with Casey Stevenson, Chris Vanzant, Ben Acree to name a few. Bill Acree, for all the things you did away from the game, the game consumes you and you need things to be in the proper order and the right way. I can't thank you enough.\n\nJohn Schuerholz, Terry McGuirk, and the whole Braves organization, you treated me with the family that I now have in Atlanta, and will forever live there, Lord willing. John Holland, Fred Stone, on the visiting side and the Spring training. I had so much fun with the guys behind the scenes because they never get enough time to be noticed or even know that they're there. And sometimes get treated in a way that doesn't represent what the game is.\n\nBefore I hand it over to the next inductee, I would be remiss if I did not talk about Tommy John. I've been given an opportunity as one of the only players, the only one right now to be inducted into the Hall of Fame with Tommy John surgery. It's an epidemic. It's something that is affecting our game. It's something that I thought would cost me my career, but thanks to Dr. James Andrews and all those before him, performing the surgery with such precision has caused it to be almost a false read like a band-aid you put on your arm.\n\nI want to encourage the families and parents that are out there to understand that this is not normal to have a surgery at fourteen and fifteen years old. That you have time, that baseball's not a year-round sport. That you have an opportunity to be athletic and play other sports. Don't let the institutions that are out there running before you guaranteeing scholarship dollars and signing bonuses that this is the way.\n\nWe have such great, dynamic arms in our game that it's a shame that we're having one, and two, and three Tommy John recipients, so I want to encourage you if nothing else, know that your children's passion and desire to play baseball is something that they can do without a competitive pitch. Every throw a kid makes today is a competitive pitch, they don't go outside, they don't have fun, they don't throw enough. But they're competing in maxing out too hard, too early, and that's why we're having these problems. So please, take care of those great future arms.\n\nTo Tommy John, I can't thank you enough for the phone call, whether you were coerced or not, the phone call at the age of thirty-four meant the world to me. Emotionally, I'd given up. I had thought that no one would last and wait for a pitcher of my age on the last year of my contract. Thank you for encouraging me, that was pivotal part of my career, to push through what I thought might be a career ending.\n\nAt thirty-four and fourteen postseason years and two-hundred postseason innings, is one of the reasons I believe that Tommy John, besides genetics, had happened to me. But because of Dr. Andrews and his brilliance and the team that had been before him, I had the confidence that the surgery would work, and the rest would write its story.\n\nLast but not least, or- close to last but not least, I want to thank Mike Nixon and Scott Runyon for taking our family up here in a plane, that was an absolute gift. And as you can see my family's huge, it takes an army. Thank you for your generosity.\n\nBeing inducted into the Hall of Fame is one of the greatest honors that I could have here on Earth. However, I know there's another one coming. The ultimate Hall of Fame. I want to thank God for the talent he has given me and the support system that I have. I would not be the man I am today if it were not for a couple people who sowed seeds into my life. Telling me about Christ and challenging me to take a deeper look into my faith.\n\nJose Alvarez, Marty Clary, Sid Bream, Terry Pendleton, the list could go on, they took the time to not care not so much about my talent but about the heart in the man that I would become. Jacky and Ken Kendall, Mike and Kia McCoy, Walt and Patti Wiley, and last Tim Cash and Barb.\n\nThese are the people, through the toughest times in my life, the intimacy of knowing what life has challenged you with. They've been in my every corner. And they've allowed me to know that I have more to live for than just the uniform that I was wearing. They gave me the greatest gift, to find my salvation in Christ and I can't thank you enough for caring so much to invest your time and your heart in me.\n\nI have a unique group of men that meets every Thursday in JR's. Jeff Foxworthy and the likes of so many men who have through those days taught me the impact that I can make, just beyond wearing a uniform.\n\nI'm so humbled to be a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame. I'm honored by so many of my family members. To be here in Cooperstown is not something I ever dreamt. I know along the way I forgot some people, but in my baseball career I've been around two men that I would entrust my children with, I would leave my children with, who have represented me in baseball with the first class and dignity that I always wanted my parents to be proud of. Myles Shoda and Lonnie Cooper. I cannot thank you for taking care of my needs away from the game and representing my intentions and not yours. It is so vital.\n\nTo the guys that introduced me in transition to broadcasting, thank you for taking the time to take a simple-minded, no-vocabulary, accordion-playing player into transition to baseball. Thank you to the MLB Network, it started with TBS, and I can't thank them- think of another home that I'd rather be and take the abuse when I get back from a great organization like the MLB Network.\n\nI think I've covered it all. I am thankful and honored and blessed. Thank you very, very much.6Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/997870", "artist_names": "Timi Yuro", "full_title": "The Love Of A Boy by\u00a0Timi\u00a0Yuro", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/05c6a54ce20b97b94d7993cc5306ccd1.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/05c6a54ce20b97b94d7993cc5306ccd1.600x600x1.jpg", "id": 997870, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429580577, "path": "/Timi-yuro-the-love-of-a-boy-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Timi-yuro-the-love-of-a-boy-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/05c6a54ce20b97b94d7993cc5306ccd1.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/05c6a54ce20b97b94d7993cc5306ccd1.600x600x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "The Love Of A Boy", "title_with_featured": "The Love Of A Boy", "updated_by_human_at": 1589846972, "url": "https://genius.com/Timi-yuro-the-love-of-a-boy-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/361051", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c6cc233baaa70c6a1cb80d39282cbd73.600x600x1.jpg", "id": 361051, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c6cc233baaa70c6a1cb80d39282cbd73.600x600x1.jpg", "index_character": "t", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Timi Yuro", "slug": "Timi-yuro", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Timi-yuro"}, "artist": "Timi Yuro", "lyrics": "The Love Of A Boy LyricsThe love of a boy\nCan change a girl\nInto a woman!\n(Woman, a woman)\nI know that it's true\n(Know that it's true)\nMy love for you\n(My love for you)\nMade me a woman!\n\nOne time I was only a girl\nYoung and afraid\nYou came to me\nAnd you gave me love \u2013\nWhat a difference you made!\nThe love of a boy\n(Love of a boy)\nCan change a girl\n(Can change a girl)\nInto a woman!\n(Woman, a woman)\nWith just one caress\n(Just one caress)\nYour tenderness\n(Your tenderness)\nMade me a woman \u2013\nMade me a woman in love!\n\nYou are faithful and true\nLove burning deep\nIn my heart and soul\nAnd it's only for you\nMy true, true love!\n\nWoah, oh oh, oh oh\nWoah, oh oh, oh oh . .

the rest remain our slaves,\nOf whom we would make sale in Malta here.\n\nFERNEZE.\nMartin del Bosco, I have heard of thee:\nWelcome to Malta, and to all of us!\nBut to admit a sale of these thy Turks,\nWe may not, nay, we dare not give consent,\nBy reason of a tributary league.\n\nFIRST KNIGHT.\nDel Bosco, as thou lov'st and honour'st us,\nPersuade our governor against the Turk:\nThis truce we have is but in hope of gold,\nAnd with that sum he craves might we wage war.\n\nMARTIN DEL BOSCO.\nWill knights of Malta be in league with Turks,\nAnd buy it basely too for sums of gold?\nMy lord, remember that, to Europe's shame,\nThe Christian isle of Rhodes, from whence you came,\nWas lately lost, and you were stated 65 here\nTo be at deadly enmity with Turks.\n\nFERNEZE.\nCaptain, we know it;

whose heart I'll have,\nAy, and his son's too, or it shall go hard.\nI am not of the tribe of Levi, I,\nThat can so soon forget an injury.\nWe Jews can fawn like spaniels when we please;\nAnd when we grin we bite;

then listen to my words,\nAnd I will teach [thee] that shall stick by thee:\nFirst, be thou void of these affections,\nCompassion, love, vain hope, and heartless fear;\nBe mov'd at nothing, see thou pity none,\nBut to thyself smile when the Christians moan.\n\nITHAMORE.\nO, brave, master! 78 I worship your nose 79 for this.\n\nBARABAS.\nAs for myself, I walk abroad o' nights,\nAnd kill sick people groaning under walls:\nSometimes I go about and poison wells;\nAnd now and then, to cherish Christian thieves,\nI am content to lose some of my crowns,\nThat I may, walking in my gallery,\nSee 'em go pinion'd along by my door.\nBeing young, I studied physic, and began\nTo practice first upon the Italian;\nThere I enrich'd the priests with burials,\nAnd always kept the sexton's arms in ure 80\nWith digging graves and ringing dead men's knells:\nAnd, after that, was I an engineer,\nAnd in the wars 'twixt France and Germany,\nUnder pretence of helping Charles the Fifth,\nSlew friend and enemy with my stratagems:\nThen, after that, was I an usurer,\nAnd with extorting, cozening, forfeiting,\nAnd tricks belonging unto brokery,\nI fill'd the gaols with bankrupts in a year,\nAnd with young orphans planted hospitals;\nAnd every moon made some or other mad,\nAnd now and then one hang himself for grief,\nPinning upon his breast a long great scroll\nHow I with interest tormented him.\nBut mark how I am blest for plaguing them;\u2014\nI have as much coin as will buy the town.\nBut tell me now, how hast thou spent thy time?\n\nITHAMORE.\nFaith, master,\nIn setting Christian villages on fire,\nChaining of eunuchs, binding galley-slaves.\nOne time I was an hostler in an inn,\nAnd in the night-time secretly would I steal\nTo travellers' chambers, and there cut their throats:\nOnce at Jerusalem, where the pilgrims kneel'd,\nI strewed powder on the marble stones,\nAnd therewithal their knees would rankle so,\nThat I have laugh'd a-good 81 to see the cripples\nGo limping home to Christendom on stilts.\n\nBARABAS.\nWhy, this is something: make account of me\nAs of thy fellow; we are villains both;\nBoth circumcised; we hate Christians both:\nBe true and secret; thou shalt want no gold.\nBut stand aside; here comes Don LODOWICK.\nEnter LODOWICK. 82\n\nLODOWICK.\nO, BARABAS, well met;\nWhere is the diamond you told me of?\n\nBARABAS.\nI have it for you, sir: please you walk in with me.\u2014\nWhat, ho, ABIGAIL! open the door, I say!\n\nEnter ABIGAIL, with letters.\n\nABIGAIL.\nIn good time, father; here are letters come\nFrom Ormus, and the post stays here within.\n\nBARABAS.\nGive me the letters.\u2014Daughter, do you hear?\nEntertain LODOWICK, the governor's son,\nWith all the courtesy you can afford,\nProvided that you keep your maidenhead:\nUse him as if he were a Philistine;\nDissemble, swear, protest, vow love to him: 83\nHe is not of the seed of Abraham.\u2014\n\n[Aside to her.]\n\nI am a little busy, sir; pray, pardon me.\u2014\nABIGAIL, bid him welcome for my sake.\n\nABIGAIL.\nFor your sake and his own he's welcome hither.\n\nBARABAS.\nDaughter, a word more: kiss him, speak him fair,\nAnd like a cunning Jew so cast about,\nThat ye be both made sure 84 ere you come out.\n[Aside to her.]\n\nABIGAIL.\nO father, Don MATHIAS is my love!\n\nBARABAS.\nI know it: yet, I say, make love to him;\nDo, it is requisite it should be so.\u2014\n[Aside to her.]\n\nNay, on my life, it is my factor's hand;\nBut go you in, I'll think upon the account.\n\n[Exeunt ABIGAIL and LODOWICK into the house.]\n\nThe account is made, for Lodovico 85 dies.\nMy factor sends me word a merchant's fled\nThat owes me for a hundred tun of wine:\nI weigh it thus much\n\n[snapping his fingers]!\n\nI have wealth enough;\nFor now by this has he kiss'd ABIGAIL,\nAnd she vows love to him, and he to her.\nAs sure as heaven rain'd manna for the Jews,\nSo sure shall he and Don MATHIAS die:\nHis father was my chiefest enemy.\n\nEnter MATHIAS.\n\nWhither goes Don MATHIAS?

friend about him\nJust because I spoke his name somewhere\nJust because I rang him number\nBy mistake today\nHe thinks I still care\n\nJust because I haunt the same old places\nWhere the mem'rys of him lingers everywhere\nJust because I'm not the happy girl\nI used to be\nHe thinks I still care\nBut if he's happy thinking\nI still need him\nThen let that silly notion bring him cheer\nOh how could he ever\nBe so foolish\nTell me where do you he get's such an idea\n\nAnd just because I asked a friend about him\nAnd just because I spoke his name somewhere\nJust because I saw him then with all to peaces\nHe thinks I still care\nHe thinks I still careYou might also likeEmbed"}]
