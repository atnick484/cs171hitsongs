(P\u00ebrkthim n\u00eb Shqip)After Hours Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThought I almost died in my dream again (Baby, almost died)\nFightin' for my life, I\u2005couldn't\u2005breathe again\nI'm fallin'\u2005in too deep (Oh, oh)\nWithout you,\u2005I can't sleep (Fallin' in)\n'Cause my heart belongs to you\nI'll risk it all for you\nI want you next to me\nThis time, I'll never leave\nI wanna share babies\nProtection, we won't need\nYour body next to me\nIs just a memory\nI'm fallin' in too deep, oh\nWithout you, I can't sleep\nInsomnia relieve, oh\nTalk to me, without you, I can't breathe\n[Verse 2]\nMy darkest hours\nGirl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room\nDifferent girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you\nI turned into the man I used to be, to be\nPut myself to sleep\nJust so I can get closer to you inside my dreams\nDidn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me\nI just wanted to call you and say, and say\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, baby\nWhere are you now when I need you most?\nI'd give it all just to hold you close\nSorry that I broke your heart, your heart\n\n[Verse 3]\nNever comin' down, uh\nI was running away from facin' reality, uh\nWastin' all of my time out living my fantasies\nSpendin' money to compensate, compensate\n'Cause I want you, baby, uh\nI be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you\nIt was simply a blessing wakin' beside you\nI'll never let you down again, again\nSee The Weeknd LiveGet tickets as low as $139You might also like[Chorus]\nOh, baby\nWhere are you now when I need you most?\nI'd give it all just to hold you close\nSorry that I broke your heart, your heart\nI said, baby\nI'll treat you better than I did before\nI'll hold you down and not let you go\nThis time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nI know it's all my fault\nMade you put down your guard\nI know I made you fall\nThen said you were wrong for me\nI lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)\nCan't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you\nYou did some things that you regret, still ride for you\n'Cause this house is not a home\n\n[Chorus]\nWithout my baby\nWhere are you now when I need you most?\nI gave it all just to hold you close\nSorry that I broke your heart, your heart\nAnd I said, baby\nI'll treat you better than I did before\nI'll hold you down and not let you go\nThis time, I

up, TNT\nI just wanna be loved\nDmac on the fuckin' track\nDon't nobody understand\u2005me\u2005though\nTahj Money\nThe way\u2005I came in the game\nThe image\u2005that I had put out\nThey wouldn't expect me to have feelings\nKnow it probably don't seem like it\nThat's why they talk about me like I ain't human, but we all is\nBut I'm still bein' me\nI'm still in the streets and I'm still thuggin' until them niggas put me under, yeah\nThat's how we livin' and that's how we goin' out, you hear me? Open your mouth\n[Verse 1]\nI say, \"Mama, I'm so sorry\"\nI got ice burned where my heart at\nOn the road where I had it hard at\nHow I'm chosen? I'm so heartless, so, so heartless\nI ain't know my age, he was sixteen, they killed Lil Dave\nMind in a rage, I'm way too young to feel this pain\nI ain't know how to fade, but I dove in 'cause I'm a man\nI love that girl to death, as we get old, our feelings change\nI pay for therapy because my thoughts ahead of me\nThey keep on draggin' me, I play for keeps, they scared of me\nI cannot barely, can barely sleep or even breathe\nI cannot hold on without you on side of me\nI never knew this fame would take the ones I love from 'way from me\nI wanna see Kacey bad, but I can't seem to call Nene\nGo in with no pen and pad, I got this shit right on my sleeve\nRight now my candle burning wax, I'm feelin' like it's burnin' me\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm just a lonely child\nWho wants someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah\nTake this pain away, this pain away\nBecause my head been runnin' wild, wild\n\n[Verse 2]\nI fell in love with Kaylyn, without even knowin' this bitch done snaked me\nI'm missin' Yaya daily, the one who don't make me feel basic\nHappiness I'm chasin', while killers behind me tryna blank me\nYou don't know what I'm feelin'\nOr what I'm thinkin' and you can't change

Future & JAY-Z]\nI hear the po-po behind me, woo, ain't gon' stop (Skrrt, skrrt)\nI see the po-po behind me, I ain't gon' stop (Skrrt, skrrt)\nI see the po-po behind me, skrrt, ain't gon' stop (Skrrt, skrrt)\nI dropped the top off the Maybach, fuck these cops ('Rrt, 'rrt)\n\n[Verse 1: JAY-Z]\nV12, see ya, 12 (Bye)\nI do the whole dash with no seatbelt\nScreamin', \"Free my nigga Meek Mill\"\nNiggas can't wheelie in this free world\nMeanwhile Georgie Porgie Cinnamon sendin' me threats\nSave your breath, you couldn't beat a flight of steps\nTry that shit with a grown man\nI'll kill that fuckboy with my own hand\nAnd hop back in the coupe (Woo, woo)\nLet's go back to the mud, I'll hop right out the suit\nSave all that woopty-woop\nLet's let the money talk, let the Uzi shoot\nNo jewels in this Patek Philippe\nIt's complicated, three million apiece\nSheesh, that's how we do time\nDujac by the mag, that's how we do wine\n91 thousand for a wine bill\nKeep it real with you, that was Juan's bill\nMy whole team ball\nEverybody's a star but the team ball\n'61 with the thing off\nMe and Blue havin' a sing-off\nThat's a raspberry beret\nThe kind you find in a second-hand store\nThat's a vintage piece\nKind that make haters kiss their teeth, you can't buy this new\nI had the 'Bach-bach-bach, you know how I do\nTwo-tone with the powder blue (Woo)\nRealest shit to come out the stu'\nKhaled is valid, every word is true\nWhat these niggas gon' do without us, Gu'?\nYou might also like[Chorus: Future]\nI took the top off the Maybach\nI took the top off the Maybach\nI took the

with the FLOTUS\nOne-point-five for the Landaulet\nBey, put these fuckboys on notice (Fuckboys on notice)\n\n[Verse 3: Beyonc\u00e9]\nHow I'm the only lady here, still the realest nigga in the room?\nI break the internet, top two and I ain't number two\nMy body, my ice, my cash, all real, I'm a triple threat\nFuck it up and then leave, come back, fuck it up and leave again\nTop off the coupe and it look like Freaknik\nIn the hood, hollerin', \"Free Meek\"\nTwo deep, it's just me and Jay\nJust posted in them courtside seats\nWoo, I'm like, \"hol' up\"\nWoo, I might roll up\nIf they're tryna party with the queen\nThey gon' have to sign a non-disclosure, ayy\n[Chorus: Beyonc\u00e9 & Future]\nI took the top off the Maybach, yeah\nI took the top off the Maybach (Ain't gon' stop)\nI took the top off the Maybach (Rah)\nI took the top off the Maybach (Woo, woo)\nAyy, I took the top off of my Maybach, bitch\nI took the top off of my Maybach, bitch\nI took the top off the

Knock yourself out\nOpen my heart to you when you lock yourself out, girl\nWhen I met her, she was posse'd up, yeah\nIn the section holding bottles up\nOh, she just wanted to be popular\nOh, she just

(You want to par-ty?) Yeah\n(We need to par-ty) Cool (let's have a par-ty) lemme get up\n\n[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]\nSaturday mornin', I ain't gotta work\nLast night's show sold a lot of merch\nBad bitch in my bed so I ain't gotta jerk\nForbes List caught me so it's hard to make a dollar hurt\nAll we need is good green and some Bou Lou\nFive to one, so it's guaranteed you can do you\n'Zilla keep the heater just in case we have a boo-boo\nKan' City natives and we all a little coo-coo\n[Chorus: B.o.B]\nThis the type of shit to make the hood go crazy\nOn the interstate doin' 180\nShe said, \"do it for me, baby\"\nTook a double shot and then we all went crazy (ah, ah, ah)\nWhite girls go crazy\nBlack girls go crazy\nCollege girls go crazy\nThis the type of shit to make the hood go crazy\n\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nSo much liquor, I never spare that kitchen\nKeep it so I usually have a pair that's kissin' *Mwah*\nAnd I'm lifted on purple hair, that's bitchin'\nNow that's what I call a fuckin' air Technician\nDown there, they got the hair that's missin'\nKeep it bare, I promise I'll never tear that kitten\nI am aware sex hittin' is the care when I share that stick and\nSo good I might impair that vision\nSo I dip in then dip off, look for another chick then they pissed off\n'Til I give them another spliff then they lift off\nParty is the mission, I did cross three thick friends\nWe mixin' these licks when they big friend wanna lip off\nSo I told her kindly, \"Get lost, bitch\"\nThis my place and it's way too turnt up to trip off shit!!\nYou might also like[Chorus: B.o.B]\nThis the type of shit to make

go crazy\nThis the type of shit to make the hood go crazy\n\n[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]\nYeah, 2 Chainz!\nYeah, you my prototype\nMy fourth foreign car was a Porsche four door, white (TRU)\nCooler than a polar bear in a bowl of ice\nWith a ring, married to the game, had 'em throwin' rice\nWait a minute, put my thing in her, I'm tryna knock her up\nI'm tryna put a singer in her so I can do a banger with her\nI get brain for dinner\nI don't need to put tender for contender, thank God for strippers\nHigh top with zippers, hard as some nipples\nAll the shit I do is straight off the temple\nTryna squeeze it into my schedule is like a pimple\nTell that poodle, \"Don't mess around with them pitbulls\"\n\n[Chorus: B.o.B]\nThis the type of shit to make the hood go crazy\nOn the interstate doin' 180\nShe said, \"do it for me, baby\"\nTook a double shot and then we all went crazy (ah, ah, ah)\nWhite girls go crazy\nBlack girls go crazy\nCollege girls go crazy\nThis the type of shit to make the hood go crazy\n[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]\nThis the endin' from the N9ne\nGrindin' bitches from behind\nIf you way drunk off the 'gnac\nSpit it up, spit it up, spit it up!\nThis Kan' City, shit's ran gritty\nIn the summertime the chicks be damn pretty\nBorn in the projects, then to the Ville\nThen I did a deal with Travis and made mills\nThis is celebration, this is elevation\nMe and my delegation got niggas hella hatin'\nThis is Nnutthowze, Regime, Rogue Dog\nAnd it's all Strange Music, winners can't lose it, unless\nEverybody got they hands up like (whoa!)\nSee a bad bitch like (ohh!)\nThis whole damn city fuckin' go\nBut this is how the hood go crazy in the Mo\n\n[Chorus: B.o.B]\nThis the type of shit to make the hood go crazy\nOn the interstate doin' 180\nShe said, \"do it for me,

kinda like a shot\nShe said, I saw you coming over, I already thought it over\nAnd okay, so now what\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something\nAt least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing\nI ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are\nAnd she said, where do you think all this is going\nI said, there ain't no way of knowing\nI guess I hadn't thought it through that far\nBut I got a car\n[Verse 2]\nSo, we let the wheels turn and the windows down\nWe let ourselves go all the way through town\nShe never said stop and I never asked her why\nWe drove into the night, when outta nowhere\nShe said, I'd give anything to never go back there\nAnd I kinda wish this day would never end\nShe said, I could use a change but I don't even know where to begin\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something\nAt least it's a start, I said, it's better than nothing\nI ain't in no hurry but I'm ready when you are\nAnd she said, where do you think all this is going\nI said, there ain't no way of knowing\nI really hadn't thought it through that far\nI can't promise you the moon and stars\nBut I got a car\n\n[Verse 3]\nWe got lost in the miles, lost track of the days\n'Til we finally found a stopping place\nWhen the doctor said, you know what's on the way\nAnd we found ourselves in a little white house\nOne Sunday morning, rain pouring down\nShe said, I think it's time but all the lines are out\nSee George Strait LiveGet tickets as low as $116You might also like[Verse 4]\nAnd her eyes teared up and she said, what are we gonna do now\nAnd I said, well I got a car, she said, there's something\nYou think it'll start, I said, it's already running\nGot your things in the back and I'm ready when you are\nShe said, are you

the D-Boys alone cause they motivate us\nAnd why is the half of my whole hood on papers?\nSome are on house arrest, some are on child support\nSome of them did they bid, the other half waiting to go to court\nMr. Landlord, we gon' bust your ass with an eviction note\nBetter have the police with you dog, if you came to repo\nI'm talking strip clubs, I'm talking liquor stores\nWe throw our money

poor people zone\nBut it's my home, all I have known\nWhere I got grown, streets we would roam\nOut of the darkness, I came the farthest\nAmong the hardest survival\nLearn from these streets, it can be bleak\nAccept no defeat, surrender, retreat\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSo we struggling, fighting to eat\nAnd we wondering when we'll be free\nSo we patiently wait for that fateful day\nIt's not far away, but for now we say\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen I get older I will be stronger\nThey'll call me freedom just like a wavin' flag\nAnd then it goes back, and then it goes back\nAnd then it goes back, oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo many wars, settling scores\nBringing us promises, leaving us poor\nI heard them say 'love is the way'\n'Love is the answer,' that's what they say\nBut look how they treat us, make us believers\nWe fight their battles, then they deceive us\nTry to control us, they couldn't hold us\nCause we just move forward like Buffalo Soldiers\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut we struggling, fighting to eat\nAnd we wondering, when we'll be free\nSo we patiently wait for that faithful day\nIt's not far away but for now we say\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWhen I get older, I will be stronger\nThey'll

drinks with pink umbrellas\nOn some island that I can't even spell\nThen we slide over to Gucci\nRight before we go for sushi\nThat's a version of my personal hell\nYou just spent all day long trying on Louis Vitton\nThere's a thousand things that I'd rather do\nLord my mom would beat me senseless\nIf she saw what I was spending on you\nIt's a business doing pleasure, a business doing pleasure

my pocket\nAin't no telling what your gonna need next\nI need to steal a Sherman tank\nJust to break into a bank\nI pray to God this song will be a success\nAll my buddies think it's funny\n'Cause I'm

chest\nOh, yes, I'm a Superwoman\n[Verse 2]\n(This is for)\nFor all the mothers fighting\nFor better days to come\nAnd all my women, all my women sitting here trying\nTo come home before the sun\nAnd all my sisters coming together\nSay \"Yes, I will,\" \"Yes, I can\"\n(Why is that?)\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I am a Superwoman\nYes, I am (Yes, she is)\nStill when I'm a mess\nI still put on a vest\nWith an \"S\" on my chest\nOh yes, I'm a Superwoman\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen I'm breaking down and I can't be found\nAs I start to get weak\n'Cause no one knows me underneath these clothes\nBut I can fly\nWe can fly, ohh\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I am a Superwoman\nYes, I am (Yes, she is)\nStill when I'm a mess\nI still put on a vest\nWith an \"S\" on my chest\nOh yes, I'm a Superwoman (Yes, she is)\nOh, let me tell you, I am Superwoman, yes, I am (Yes, she is)\nOh, yeah\n'Cause even when I'm a mess\nI still put on a vest\nWith an \"S\" on my chest\nOh yes, I'm Superwoman (Yes, I am)\nSaid I'm a Superwoman (Yes, she is)\nHey yeah, oh yeah\nYou might also like[Outro]\nI'm super, I'm super\nYes, I am, yeah (Yes, we are)\nYes, I am\n(Yes, you are)\nOh8Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWe don\u2019t have time left to regret (Hold on)\nIt will take more than common sense (Hold on)\nSo stop your wondering, take a stand (Hold on)\nThere's more to life than just to live (Hold on)\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause an empty room can be so loud\nIt's too many tears to drown them out\nSo hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on\n[Verse 2]\nOne single smile, a helping hand (Hold on)\nIt's not that hard to be a friend (Hold on)\nSo don\u2019t give up, stand till the end (Hold on)\nThere's more to life than just to live (Hold on)\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause an empty room can be so loud\nIt's too many tears to drown them out\nSo hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on\nWhen you love someone and they break your heart\nDon\u2019t give up on love, have faith, restart\nJust hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on\n\n[Bridge]\nWhen it falls apart\nAnd you're feeling lost\nAll your hope is gone\nDon\u2019t forget to hold on, hold on\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause an empty room can be so loud\nIt's too many tears to drown them out\nSo hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on\nWhen you love someone and they break your heart\nDon\u2019t give up on love, have faith, restart\nJust hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on\nYou

days\nOne, two, three, four!\n\n[Refrain]\nEverybody makes mistakes\nEverybody has those days (Oh yeah)\nEverybody knows what, what I'm talkin' 'bout\nEverybody gets that way (That's right)\nEverybody makes mistakes (Uh huh)\nEverybody has those days\nEverybody knows what, what I'm talkin' 'bout\nEverybody gets that way, yeah\n[Verse 1]\nSometimes I'm in a jam, I've gotta make a plan\nIt might be crazy, I do it anyway\nNo way to know for sure, I figure out a cure\nI'm patching up the holes, but then it overflows\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf I'm not doing too well\nWhy be so hard on myself?\n\n[Chorus]\nNobody's perfect, I gotta work it\nAgain and again, 'til I get it right\nNobody's perfect, you live and you learn it\nAnd if I mess it up sometimes (hey)\nNobody's perfect\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes I work a scheme, but then it flips on me\nDoesn't turn out how I planned, gets stuck in quicksand\nBut no problem can't be solved once I get involved\nI try to be delicate, then crash right into it\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut my intentions are good (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nSometimes just misunderstood\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nNobody's perfect, I gotta work it (Work

I'll find a way (Oh)\nNobody's perfect\n\n[Bridge]\nSometimes I fix things up, and they fall apart again\n(Nobody's perfect)\nI might mix things up, but I always get it right in the end\n(You know I do)\n\n[Spoken Interlude]\nNext time you feel like it's just one of those days\nWhen you just can't seem to win\nIf things don't turn out the way you planned\nFigure something else out, don't stay down, try again\nYeah\n\n[Refrain]\nEverybody makes mistakes\nEverybody has those days (That's right)\nEverybody knows what, what I'm talkin' 'bout\nEverybody gets that way\nEverybody makes mistakes
