love you)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI woke up kind of early today and something told me from that moment it wouldn't be the same\nFelt like you were hiding something, but I didn't push it\nI didn't complain or say nothing\nI tried to act like I didn't see it\n'Cause deep down, I knew I didn't wanna believe it\nThere it was, it was you and her, you left your sidekick on the nightstand\nAnd I read\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEverything you did and everything you said\nNow I'm standing here looking like damn\nI thought it was you and I\nNow all I got to say is why\n\n[Chorus]\nAfter all of the times

that I love)\nThe way that I love (The way that I love you)\nOhh, ohh, ohh\n\n[Verse 2]\nI notice now that when I'm around you be tryna lock the doors, whispering on the phone\nNow wait a minute, since we been in this house, you ain't never did this before\nTell me what's this about, I tried to sit and say to myself\nThis here is too good, he don't want nothing else\nBut there it was, it was you and her\nYou left the credit card receipt inside the beamer with\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nEverything you bought\nEverything you spent, now I'm standing here once again\nI thought it was you and I, now all

gotta try harder\n\n[Hook: Akon]\nI tried so hard\nCan't seem to get away from misery\nMan, I tried so hard\nWill always be a victim of these streets\nIt ain't my fault \u2018cause I\nTry to get away but trouble follows me\nAnd still I try so hard\nHopin' one day you'll come and rescue me\nBut until then I'll be posted up\nRight here: rain, sleet, hail, snow\nBut until then I'll be posted up\nRight here with my heat, gettin' dough\n[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]\nFirst let me explain that I'm just a black man\nAnd I come from the dark side\nSo I'm havin' a hard time stayin' on track, man\nMy mind be racin' and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet\nBeen in and out of relationships\nSo I'm startin' to see that it's me where the complications at\nBut I'm layin' back, prayin' that\nYou give that peace of mind to me\nI thought I was right but really I'm wrong\nThen again I was too blind to see\nI was in the fast lane chasin' my dreams\nAnd then it seem when the fame and cash came\nThey just got me goin' crazy-y-y, lately\nI've been so faded tryin' to erase it\nBut I just can't \u2018cause the drama just grows greater\nAnd I've been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off 'til later\n\n[Hook: Akon]\nI tried so hard\nCan't seem to get away from misery\nMan, I tried so hard\nWill always be a victim of these streets\nIt ain't my fault \u2018cause I\nTry to get away but trouble follows me\nAnd still I try so hard\nHopin' one day you'll come and rescue me\nBut until then I'll be posted up\nRight here: rain, sleet, hail, snow\nBut until then I'll be posted up\nRight here with

of the game but I can't seem to get it on track\nAnd I keep runnin' away the ones that say they love me the most\nHow could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close?\nAnd uh, I just don't know but I be out here fightin' demons\nAnd it's like a curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland\nAnd Lord, would you help me?\nAnd stop this pain I keep inflictin' on my family?\nHustlin' and gamblin', trickin' and scramblin'\nAnd losin' sight of what I'm supposed to be handlin'\nIt's hard to manage \u2018cause everyday's a challenge\nAnd man, I'm slippin', can't lose my balance, I'm tryin' not to panic\n\n[Hook: Akon]\nI tried so hard\nCan't seem to get away from misery\nMan, I tried so hard\nWill always be a victim of these streets\nIt ain't my fault \u2018cause I\nTry to get

up\nRight here with my heat, gettin' dough\n[Verse 3: Wish Bone]\nI see that things won't change\nI'm stuck in the game\nAs soon as I get out it keeps pullin' me back, mane\nGot me doin' dirty dirt\nSo used to this hustlin' money\nThat I don't understand no 9-to-5 work\nStudied on the streets, hustlas know what I mean\nHustlas ballin' before us\nI'm tryin' to make it to that major league\nSo we will never leave until the sun came up\nGotta get it\u2014no, nope, not leavin' no budge\nToday games they play\nGotta go hard to get what you put in\nIf you fall off then it's all on you\nGotta watch what you sign to\nTry so hard but I won't pull through\n\n[Hook: Akon]\nI tried so hard\nCan't seem to get away from misery\nMan, I tried so hard\nWill always be a victim of these streets\nIt ain't my fault \u2018cause I\nTry to get away but trouble follows me\nAnd still I try so hard\nHopin' one day you'll come and rescue me\nBut until then I'll be posted up\nRight here: rain,

says something's gotta give\n\n[Chorus]\nSomething's gotta give me butterflies\nSomething's gotta make me feel alive\nSomething's gotta give me dreams at night\nSomething's gotta make me feel alright\nI don't know where it is\nBut something's gotta give\n\n[Verse 2]\nFriday night, she had a date\nCell phone junky\nA half hour late\nThat's the biz, baby\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShe's riding out the twists of fate\nShe's had all that she can take\nShe says something's gotta give\n\n[Chorus]\nSomething's gotta give me butterflies\nSomething's gotta make me feel alive\nSomething's gotta give me dreams at night\nSomething's gotta make me feel alright\nI don't know where it is\nBut something's gotta give\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nI swear\nThere's got to be a meant to be for me out

my name\nCall it, call my name\n\n[Verse 1]\nI've heard your voice this morning\nCalling out my name\nIt had been so long, since I've heard\nThat it didn't really sound quite the same, no\n\nBut it let me know that my name\nHad never really been spoken before\nBefore the day I carried you\nThrough the bridal path door\nAnd ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you\nAnd anybody who really knows me knows the truth\nThat I\n\n[Chorus]\nI just can't stop writing songs about you\nI love you so much\nI just can't wait to get my arms around you\nAnd feel your touch\nIf I don't see you real soon, baby girl\nI might go insane\nI know it's only been three hours\nBut I love it when you call my name, yes I do\n\n[Verse 2]\nI heard a voice on the news saying\nPeople wanna stop the war (Stop the war)\nIf they had a love as sweet as you\nThey'd forget what they were fighting for\n\nWhat's the matter with the world today?\nThe land of the free, somebody lied\nThey can bug my phone and peep around my home\nThey'll only see you and me making love inside\n\n[Chorus]\nI just can't stop writing songs about you\nI love you so much\nI just can't wait to get my arms around you\nAnd feel your touch\nIf I don't see you real soon, baby girl\nI might go insane\nI know it's only been three hours\nBut I love it when you call my name, yes I do\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nI never seen the moon look so lovely\nAs the night I saw it with you\nLet me know I'd never seen the moon before\nSo many speak of the moon\nAs though it had no flaws\nBut to compare it to a beauty like yours\nWould give one pause\n\nNothing about you is false\nThat's why your love is real\nThat's why your love is real love\nGod forbid if you belonged to another\nI'd have to steal you\n\nI'd have to take you from your man\nI might be tempted to break the law 'round here\nBecause your beauty it gives one pause\nIt slows me down\n\n[Chorus]\nI just can't stop writing songs about you\nI love you so much\nI just can't wait to get my arms around you\nAnd feel your touch\nIf I don't see you real soon, baby girl\nI might go insane, right\nI know it's only been three hours\nBut I love it when you call my name, yes I do\n[Outro]\nI love it when you call my name\nCall, call my name\nCall it, call my nameEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/3180", "artist_names": "T.I.

loving\nI know it gon' drive me, crazy\nI wanna be your lover\nI wanna get to know you, baby\nOne dose of my loving\nI know it gon' drive you, crazy\n\n[Verse 1: Young Buck]\nI'm loving how you look in my eyes, swanging them hips when you pass\nI'm visualizing my name tattooed on that ass, baby\nJump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley\nSip some Bacardi then go pull up at the after party\nI think we make a perfect couple, but you think I'm trouble\nMaybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number (what?)\nShe got me feeling like, maybe she the wrong woman\nThink I'ma be chasing a chickenhead, you're on something\nYour toes painted, hair fixed all the time\nAnd your Gucci boots the same color as mine\nIf you read between the lines you can see that I want you\nI betcha I'll have you doing what you said that you won't do\nMake a decision shorty, good things don't last long\nYour girlfriend keeps showing me that thong\nBefore I head home I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn\nIf you come outside you know it's on, holla at your boy\n[Chorus: Joe]\nI wanna get to know ya\nI really wanna fuck you, baby\nOne dose of your loving\nI know it gon' drive me, crazy\nI wanna be your lover\nI wanna get to know you, baby\nOne dose of my loving\nI know it gon' drive you, crazy\n\n[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]\nLately she's been frustrated with the baller, wonder why I don't call her\nMaybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her\nIt gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her\nIn order to let her know that we friends and nutting more\nShe loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around\nI get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound\nPictures hitting the ground, just enough to hold us down\nI'm sticking and moving, cruising after the third round\nJust lay back baby and let me drive you crazy\nI can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady\nI admit I fell in love with her frame\nAnd to make her feel special I let her call me by my government name\nHer panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain\nI wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?\nSurrounding me, hounding me, trying to be my ON-LY\nI'm not your boyfriend, I'm your HO-MIE\nYou might also like[Chorus: Joe]\nI wanna get to know ya\nI really wanna fuck you, baby\nOne dose of your loving\nI know it gon' drive me, crazy\nI wanna be your lover\nI wanna get to know you, baby\nOne dose of my loving\nI know it gon' drive you, crazy\n\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nYeah...\nDon't know what fucked me up more: watching her lick her lips\nOr watching her walk, she hypnotized me with her hips, man\nI sweet talk her if she like\n'Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right?\nLook, I'm legit now, I used to break laws\nNow you can reap the benefits of world tours (wooo!)\nBig house, big Benz \u2013 girl, it's yours\nMink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws\nYou ain't got to look like a model for me to adore you\nAll you gotta do is love me and be loyal\nDon't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you\n'Cause it means somebody's gon' hate you that never saw you\nCome here, let me touch on you, I let you touch on me\nPut my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me\nLet me ride on you, and you can ride on\nWe can do it all the night, we can have a baller night\n[Chorus: Joe]\nI wanna get to know ya\nI really wanna fuck you, baby\nOne dose of your loving\nI know it gon' drive me, crazy\nI wanna be your lover\nI wanna get to know you, baby\nOne dose of my loving\nI know it gon' drive you, crazy\nI wanna get to know ya\nI really wanna fuck you, baby\nOne dose of your loving\nI know it gon' drive me, crazy\nI wanna be your lover\nI wanna get to know you, baby\nOne dose of my

to stunt\nNigga you can't see me\nMy Bentley GT got smoke-gray tints\nI'll teach you how to stunt\nMy neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man\nI'll teach you how to stunt\nI see you scheming, nigga keep on dreaming, I hurt ya man\nI'll teach you how to stunt\n[Verse 3: Young Buck]\nChain so icy, you don't have to like me\nIn a throwback jersey, with the throwback Nikes\nI know you probably seen me with Cash Money from back in the days\nThe only thing changed is the numbers on the Range\nI bought me an old school and blew out the brains\nThe Roc the Mic tour, I threw off my chain\nMy Sprewell's spinning man, I'm doing my thing\nAnd whodi now in trouble now that you in the game\nCome on now, we all know gold is getting old\nThe ice in my teeth keep the Cristal cold\nG-Unit homie, acting like y'all don't know\nLook, I can't even walk through the mall no more\nI just pull up, get out, and get all the hoes\nThey never seen doors lift up on a car before\nDon't be mad at me dog, that's all I know\nThat's how to show these fugazies how it's supposed to go, yeah\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nI'll teach you how to stunt\nMy wrists stay rocked up\nMy TV's pop up in a Maybach Benz\nI'll teach you how to stunt\nNigga you can't see me\nMy Bentley GT got smoke-gray tints\nI'll teach you how to stunt\nMy neck stay blinging, my rims stay gleaming, I'm shining man\nI'll

Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)\nSing it with me, it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nEntertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters\nIn the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum\nHoly or unholy, only have one homie\nOnly this gun, lonely \u2018cause don't anyone know me\nYet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)\nI guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great\nOr they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate\nIt's like these kids hang on every single statement we make\nLike they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum\nNow how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?\nFrom standin' on corners and porches just rappin'\nTo havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass\nBut then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you\nFans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you\nTo get they hands on every dime you have\nThey want you to lose your mind every time you mad\nSo they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon\nAny dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns\nThat's why these prosecutors wanna convict me\nStrictly just to get me off of these streets quickly\nBut all they kids be listenin' to me religiously\nSo I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me\nThey're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me\nIf I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B\nIt's all political, if my music is literal\nAnd I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?\nI couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to\nYou're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you!

How we can come from practically nothin'\nTo bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted\nThat's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing\nExcept for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)\nWho post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long\nIdolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs\nOr for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives\nSo they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die\n'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe\nWe're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes\nThat's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it\nSqueeze it and hold it \u2018cause we consider these minutes golden\nAnd maybe they'll admit it when we're gone\nJust let our spirits live on\nThrough our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can\u2014\n[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]\nSing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)\nSing it with me, it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away\n[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]\nSing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)\nSing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)\nSing it with me, it's just for today\nMaybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away330Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/9579", "artist_names": "Benzino (Ft.

me\nBut she's got a funny way of showin' me how she cares\nLast night she did a doughnut on my lawn\nAnd drove out with one finger in the air, oh yeah\nSometimes it's black, sometimes it's white\nSometimes she's wrong, sometimes I'm right\nSometimes we talk about it or we figure it out\nBut then she'll just change her mind\n\nSometimes she's hot, sometimes I'm cold\nSometimes my head wants to explode\nBut when I think about it, I'm so in love with her every other time\nYeah, every other time\n\nSometimes we sit around\nJust the two of us, on the park bench\nSometimes we swim around\nLike the dolphins in the ocean of our hearts\n\nBut then I think about the time\nWhen we broke up before the prom\nAnd you told everyone that I was gay\nOkay\n\nSometimes I walk around the town\nFor hours just to settle down\nBut I take you back and you kick me down\n'Cause that's the way, uh huh uh huh, I like it\n\nSometimes it's black, sometimes it's white\nSometimes she's wrong,

things\nWins a Nobel Prize and saves a million different lives\nThe world's a better place for all he's done\nIt's funny when you think about the reason he's alive\nIt's all because two people fell in love\n\nRight now at a picnic shelter down by Caney Creek\nYou'll find potato salad hot dogs and baked beans\nThe whole Wilson family's lined up filling their paper plates\nThey've driven or flown in here from fifteen different states\nWell Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew\nThat Miss Emma Tucker was the one\nNow five generations get together every June\nAll because two people fell in love\n[Chorus]\nThere is nothing not affected\nWhen two hearts get connected\nAll that is, will be, or ever was\nEvery single choice we make\nEvery breath we get to take\nIs all because two people fell in love\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I recall a young man who was drifting aimlessly\nAnd a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be\nBut in a little cafe right off of fourteenth avenue\nWith a whole lot to help from up above\nWe met and things sure turned around for me and you\nAnd all because two people fell in love\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Tag]\nYou know, to me it's all so clear\nEvery one of us

got a man\nAt home\nIt hurts me\nYour man's leaving you all alone\nI can't help it that your baby's bad\nCreeping out\nCheating on you\nBeating on you\nChant\u00e9\u2019s got a man at home\nAnd he's so good to me\n[Verse 1]\nI'm sorry that your man ain't home\nI'm sorry that yours left you alone\nIt's such a shame\nYour man is playing games\nAnd I heard you say\nThat men are all the same\nNo, no, no\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's not the truth, girl\nCause I got proof, girl\nOh I got proof, girl\nI got a man at home\n\n[Chorus]\nChant\u00e9\u2019s got a man\nAt home\nIt hurts me\nYour man's leaving you all alone\nI can't help it that your baby's bad\nCreeping out\nCheating on you\nBeating on you\nChant\u00e9\u2019s got a man at home\nAnd he's sure good to me\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nListen\nNow why'd you let him beat you down?\nNo, no, what's up with that\nThere's good men around\nDon't you know\nHow beautiful you are inside, girl\nAnd don't you let nobody\nGo and steal your pride\nOh no no, I know your thing, girl\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIt's not the truth, girl\nCause I got proof, girl\nOh I got proof, girl\nI got a man at home\n\n[Chorus]\nChant\u00e9\u2019s got a man\nAt home\nIt hurts me\nYour man's leaving you all alone\nI can't help it that your baby's bad\nCreeping out\nCheating on you\nBeating on you\nChant\u00e9\u2019s got a man at home\nAnd he's so good to me\n[Bridge]\nI once was where you are\nThought men were all the same\nBut I never gave up hope\nAnd now my life has changed\nListen to me, girls\nOne bad apple\nDon't spoil the whole bunch, girl\nHe always treats me right\nWe never fight\nHe sends me flowers\nAnd wines and dines me\nTook me home to meet his mama\nHow he loves me\nOne bad apple\nDon't spoil the whole bunch, girl\nGive it one more try\nBefore you give up on love\n\n[Chorus]\nChant\u00e9\u2019s got a man\nAt home\nIt hurts me\nYour man's leaving you all alone\nI can't help it that your baby's bad\nCreeping out\nCheating on you\nBeating on you\nChant\u00e9\u2019s got a man at home\nAnd he's so good to me\n\n[Spoken Outro]\nThat's my man calling me\nHello?Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 21, "api_path":

head to cry\nI sing to her a lullaby\n\n[Chorus]\nEverything is gonna be all right\nRockabye\nRockabye\nEverything is gonna be all right\nRockabye\nRockabye\nRockabye\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe still lives with her mom outside the city\nDown that street\nAbout a half a mile\nAnd all her friends tell her she`s so pretty\n\nBut she`d be a whole lot prettier\nIf she smiled once in a while\nCause even her smile looks like a frown\nShe`s seen her share of devils in this angel town\nYou might also like[Repeat Chorus]\nEverything is gonna be all right\nRockabye\nRockabye\nEverything is gonna be all

kind of like Nashville with a tan\n\n[Chorus]\nEverything is gonna be all right\nRockabye\nRockabye\nEverything`s gonna be all right\nRockabye\nRockabye\n\nEverything`s gonna be all

planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nAnother dimension, another dimension\nAnother dimension, another dimension\nAnother dimension, another dimension\nAnother dimension, another dimension\nAnother dimension, another dimension\nAnother dimension, another dimension\n[Verse 1: Mike D]\nWell, now, don't you tell me to smile\nYou stick around, I'll make it worth your while\nGot numbers beyond what you can dial\nMaybe it's because I'm so versatile\nStyle, profile\n\n[Verse 2: Ad-Rock]\nI said it always brings me back when I hear \"Ooh child\"\nFrom the Hudson River out to the Nile\nI run the marathons 'til the very last mile\n\n[Verse 3: MCA]\nWell, if you battle me, I will revile\nPeople always saying my style is wild\nYou've got gall, you've got guile (Guile)\nTo step to me, I\u2019m a rapophile\n\n[Verse 4: Mike D]\nIf you wanna battle, you're in denial\nComing from Uranus to check my style\nGo ahead; put my rhymes on trial\nCast you off into exile\n\n[Chorus]\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nYou might also like[Verse 5: Ad-Rock]\nJazz and AWOL, that's our team\nStep inside the party, disrupt the whole scene\nWhen it comes to beats, well, I'm a fiend\nI like my sugar with coffee and cream\n\n[Verse 6: MCA]\nWell, I gotta keep it going, keep it going full steam\nToo sweet to be sour; too nice to be mean\nWell, on the tough guy style, I'm not too keen\nTrying to change the world, I will plot and scheme\n\n[Verse 7: Mike D]\nMario C likes to keep it clean (Clean)\nGoin' to shine like a sunbeam\nKeep on rapping 'cause that's my dream\nGot an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes\n\n[Verse 8: Ad-Rock]\nNow when it comes to envy, y'all is green\nJealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine ('tine)\nAnother dimension, new galaxy\nIntergalactic planetary\n\n[Chorus]\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\n[Verse 9: MCA]\nWe're from the family tree of old school hip-hop\nKick off your shoes and relax your socks\nThe rhymes will spread just like a pox\n'Cause the music is live, like an electric shock\n\n[Verse 10: Mike D]\nI am known to do the wop (Wop)\nAlso known for the Flintstone Flop\nTammy D getting biz on the crop (Crop)\nBeastie Boys known to let the beat\n\"MMM, D-r-r-rop!\"\nDo it\n\n[Verse 11: Ad-Rock]\nNow when I wrote graffiti, my name was Slop\nIf my rap's soup, my beats is stock\nStep from the table when I start to chop\nI'm the lumberjack, DJ Adrock\n\n[Verse 12: MCA]\nIf you try to knock me, you'll get mocked\nI'll stir fry you in my wok\nYour knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop\nLike a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock\n\n[Chorus]\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nIntergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic\nAnother dimension, another

ears\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe watched as her high school faded behind her\nAnd the house with the white picket fence\nThen she read the note that her momma had wrote\nWrapped up with 26 cents\n[Chorus]\nWhen you get lonely, call me\nAnytime at all and I'll be there with you, always\nAnywhere at all\nThere's nothing I've got that I wouldn't give\nAnd money is never enough\nHere's a penny for your thoughts\nA quarter for the call\nAnd all of your momma's love\n\n[Verse 3]\nA penny and quarter buys a whole lot of nothing\nTaped to an old wrinkled note\nAnd when she didn't have much she had all Momma's love\nInside that old envelope\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you get lonely, call me\nAnytime at all and I'll be there with you, always\nAnywhere at all\nThere's nothing I've got that I wouldn't give\nAnd money is never enough\nHere's a penny for your thoughts\nA quarter for the call\nAnd all of your momma's love\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nOh it's been years since Momma's been gone\nBut when she holds the coins\nShe feels her love just as strong\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you get lonely, call me\nAnything at all and I'll be there with you, always\nAnywhere at all\nThere's nothing I've got that I wouldn't give\nAnd money is never enough\nHere's a penny for your thoughts\nA quarter for the call\nAnd all of your momma's love\n\n[Tag]\nHere's a penny for your thoughts\nQuarter for the call\nAnd
