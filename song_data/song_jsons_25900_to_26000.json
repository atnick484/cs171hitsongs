day\nI get 'em alone, I jump 'em and then fade away\nI give it good so some of them won't stay away\nThey try to lock me up, but I break away\nAnd to the day i lay my eyes on the princess\nAnd you can tell she was a dime from a distance\nIt took a minute to come to my senses\nShe's the perfect match and God is my witness\nNow for the first time I've opened my eyes\nPut the glass in the air, now I toast to the sky\nFeels like I'm in heaven, and I'm hoping to fly\nBaby girl, come along for the ride, you know why cause I...\n\n[Hook: Amerie]\nNow you done been around the world\nAnd you'd seen a

more regrets unraveling, oh!\nIf you were here right now\nI swear I'd tell you this\n[Chorus: All]\nBaby, I don't wanna waste another day\nKeeping it inside is killing me\n'Cause all I ever wanted\nComes right down to you, to you\nI wish that I could find the words to say\nBaby, I would tell you\nEvery time you leave I'm inconsolable\n\n[Verse 2: AJ]\nI climb the walls, yeah\nI can see the edge, but I can't take the fall, no\nI've memorized the number\nSo why can't I make the call?\nMaybe 'cause I know you will always be with me\nIn the possibility, oh-oh-oh!\n\n[Chorus: All & AJ]\nBaby, I don't wanna waste another day\n(Another day)\nKeeping it inside is killing me\n'Cause all I ever wanted\nComes right down to you, to you\nI wish that I could find the words to say\nBaby,

still\n\nCause the world keeps spinning 'round and 'round\nAnd my heart's keeping time to the speed of sound\nI was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way\n\n[TRACY & LINK]\nCause you can't stop the beat\nEver since this whole world began\nA woman found out if she shook it she could shake up a man\nAnd so I'm gonna shake and shimmy it the best that I can today\n'Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the sun in the sky\nYou can wonder if you wanna, but I'll never ask why\nIf you try to hold me down I'm gonna spit in your eye and say\nThat you can't stop the beat\n\n[TRACY]\n(spoken)\nWhat do you have to say Penny?\n\n[PENNY]\n(spoken)\nI am now a checkerboard chick!\n(sung)\nYou can't stop the river as it rushes to the sea\nYou can try to stop the hands of time, but you know it just won't be\nAnd if they try to stop us, Seaweed\nI'll call the NAACP\n'Cause the world keeps spinning 'round and 'round\n\n[SEAWEED]\n'Round and 'round\n\n[PENNY]\nAnd my heart's keeping time to the speed of sound\n\n[SEAWEED]\nSpeed of sound\nYou might also like[PENNY]\nI was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way\n\n[ALL]\n'Cause you can't stop the beat\nEver since we first saw the light\nA man and woman liked to shake it on a Saturday night\nSo I'm gonna shake and shimmy it with all of my might today\n\n'Cause you can't stop the motion of the ocean or the rain from above\nYou can try to stop the paradise we're dreaming of\nBut you cannot stop the rhythm of two hearts in love to stay\n'Cause you can't stop the beat\n\n[EDNA]\n(spoken)\nTracy I have a little something I'd like to add\n(sung)\nYou can't stop my happiness, 'cause I like the way I am\nAnd you just can't stop my knife and fork when I see a Christmas ham\nSo if you don't like the way I look, well, I just don't give a damn\nCause the world\nKeeps spinning 'round and 'round\n\n[EDNA & COMPANY]\nKeeps spinning 'round and 'round\nAnd my heart's\nKeeping time to the speed of sound\nKeeping time to the speed of sound\nI was lost\n'til I heard the drums, then I found my way\n'Til I heard the drums, then I found my way\nCause you can't

beat\n\n[MOTORMOUTH]\n(spoken)\nStep aside [?] It's time to wrap this mother up!\n(sung)\nOh, oh, oh, you can't stop today (No)\nAs it comes speeding down the track (Ooo child)\nYesterday is history and it's never coming back (Begone)\n'Cause tomorrow is a\nBrand new day\nBrand new day\nAnd it don't know white from black (Yeah)\n\n[MOTORMOUTH & ENSEMBLE]\n'Cause the world\nKeeps spinning 'round and 'round\nKeeps spinning 'round and 'round\nAnd my heart's\nKeeping time to the speed of sound\nKeeping time to the speed of sound\nI was lost 'til I heard the drums, then I found my way\n'Til I

Hello friend? That\u2019s lame. Maybe I should give you a name? But that\u2019s a slippery slope. You\u2019re only in my head. We have to remember that. Shit. It\u2019s actually happened. I\u2019m talking to an imaginary person.\n\nWithin the black of frame, silhouettes begin forming.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): What I'm about to tell you is top-secret.\n\nWe pull out to reveal we\u2019re in an office looking out of a very tall Manhattan skyscraper. Shadowy figures sit and stand around a conference table, arguing.\nELLIOT (V.O.): A conspiracy bigger than all of us. There's a powerful group of people out there who are secretly running the world.\nELLIOT (V.O.): I'm talking about the guys that no one knows about. The guys that are invisible. The top 1% of the top 1%. The guys that play God without permission.\nCUT TO BLACK.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): And now I think they\u2019re following me.\n\nINT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING\nWe finally meet ELLIOT (late 20s). His hoodie throws a sliced shadow over his face.\nHe sneaks looks at a couple of mysterious MEN DRESSED IN BLACK, one on either side of the train. One reads the NY Post. The other looks straight ahead, suspiciously so.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): This is about last night. I should have gone to Angela\u2019s birthday party. Instead I went to--\n\nINT. RON\u2019S COFFEE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\nA large coffee shop with a fair amount of patrons. A cheesy sign that reads \u201cRon's Coffee\u201d displays on the door. Elliot sits by himself, hoodie on, no coffee. His leg taps nervously.\n\nElliot intently watches as a mild-mannered Indian with a mustache walks into the shop. This is RON (40s-50s).\n\nHe orders a latte from the front and sits alone. He pulls out his iPad and sips his latte, enjoying the quiet evening to himself.\n\nElliot musters courage with a deep breath and walks over. He sits across from him without saying a word, his leg twitching.\n\nRON stares at him.\nELLIOT: You're Ron.\n\nHe nervously gestures to the cheesy sign. Confused, Ron glares at him in response.\n\nELLIOT (nervous and robotic): But your real name is Rohit Mehta. You changed it to Ron when you bought your first Ron\u2019s Coffee shop six years ago. Now you got 17 of 'em with 8 more coming next quarter.\n\nAn awkward silence. Ron tilts his head, not sure if he should be flattered or concerned.\n\nRON (thick Indian accent): May I help you with something?\n\nELLIOT: I like coming here 'cause your Wi-Fi was fast. I mean, you're one of the few spots that has a fiber connection with gigabit speed. It's good. So good, it scratched that part of my mind, part that doesn't allow good to exist without condition, so I started intercepting all the traffic on your network. That's when I noticed something strange. It's when I decided to hack you.\n\nAnother awkward silence. Ron leans forward.\n\nRON: Hack--\n\nELLIOT: I know you run a website - called Plato's Boys.\nAlarms suddenly go off in Ron\u2019s world.\n\nRON: Pardon me?\n\nELLIOT: You're using Tor networking to keep the servers anonymous. You made it really hard for anyone to see it, but I saw it.\n\nEven though Elliot came off a little amateurish at first, his confidence builds as he continues to talk.\nELLIOT: The onion routing protocol, it's not as anonymous as you think it is. Whoever's in control of the exit nodes is also in control of the traffic, which makes me...the one in control.\n\nRON: I must ask you to kindly leave--\n\nElliot pulls out a thick folder of files and places it on the table.\n\nELLIOT: I own everything. All your emails. All your files. All your pics.\n\nRon flips through a few pages then slaps the folder close.\n\nRON (angry): Get out of here right now, or I'll call the--\n\nELLIOT: Police? You want them to find out about the 100 terabytes of child pornography you serve to your 400,000 users?\nRon is stunned silent. Ron looks down, cornered and speechless. Elliot looks genuinely sympathetic.\n\nELLIOT: Personally, man, I was hoping it was just gonna be some BDSM stuff. You realize how much simpler that would have been?\n\nRON: I did not hurt anyone. I never did. That's my personal life.\n\nAll the blood in Phil\u2019s face as drained. Emotion begins to fill his face. Elliot looks at him, a mix of pity and guilt.\n\nELLIOT: I understand what it's like to be different. I'm very different too. I mean, I don't jerk off to little kids, but I don't know how to talk to people. My dad was the only one I could talk to. But he died.\n\nAt first, Ron is unsure on how to proceed. But sensing an opportunity, he takes a deep breath and nods sympathetically.\n\nRON: I'm sorry to hear that. How did he pass, may I ask?\n\nELLIOT: Leukemia. He definitely got it from radiation at the company he worked at, though I couldn't prove it. Now he's dead. Company's fine, though.\n\nRon can\u2019t help but start crying. Elliot genuinely feels for him.\n\nELLIOT: Oh hey. It's okay, Rohit. You don't have to worry anymore.\n\nRon looks up, confused.\n\nRON (confused then angry): I don't understand. Are you blackmailing me? So that's what this is about money. That's all you care about, huh? No. If I pay you now, you'll want more and more. No matter how much I give. You will inform the police anyway. I won't pay you, sir. Remember, you also broke the law.\n\nElliot nods agreeingly. He looks out the windows, as if looking for something.\n\nELLIOT: Actually, you're right. Partly. See, I usually do this kind of thing from my computer, but this time I wanted to do it AFK. In person. Trying to work on my social anxiety. But there's always the threat of you fleeing after I call you out.\n\nElliot leans over and begins to zip up his bag, getting ready to stand.\n\nELLIOT: You'd tell your sys admin to take your servers down, wipe all the data.\n\nElliot stands, putting his oversized bookbag on.\n\nELLIOT: So I made sure to include the current time and and location on my anonymous tip.\n\nRon stands up with Elliot.\n\nRON (desperate, nervous): Wait. Hold on. I'll give you the money. I'll pay you. How much do you want? I'll pay you.\n\nSirens can be heard. Lights swirl outside the windows.\n\nELLIOT: That's the part you were wrong about, Rohit. I don't give a shit about money.\nPOLICE race into the shop as Elliot breezes past them, heading out, leaving the chaos to surround the destroyed Phil.\nViolent jazz slowly BUILDS on the soundtrack.\nTITLE SEQUENCE\nINT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING\nBack to present day, Elliot snaps awake. He eyes the two MEN IN BLACK who still sneak looks at him.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Now I'm being followed. The higher ups don't like someone with my powers. In three short minutes, I destroyed a man's business, life, existence. I deleted him.\n\nOn the far end of the packed train, a dark-haired man YAWNS loudly. He looks like a disheveled Californian who\u2019s been forced to relocate. He wears cargo pants and what looks like a gas attendant shirt that reads: Computer Repair With A Smile. Below it, a logo reads MR. ROBOT (40s). He looks at Elliot with a stoner\u2019s smile as he brushes his scraggly beard. Elliot doesn\u2019t smile back. Across the crowd of people, the man shouts:\nMR. ROBOT: Hey! Hey, you. Hey, kiddo. What's happening?\n\nElliot doesn\u2019t answer. Instead, he looks away, pretending he didn\u2019t hear him.\n\nMR. ROBOT: Exciting time in the world right now. Exciting time.\nMr. Robot lies on his back, returning to his homeless slumber.\nEXT. NYC STREETS - LATER\nElliot walks through the crowded streets of New York, carefully avoiding the touch of other humans. He carries a huge bookbag on his back.\nINT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - LATER\nHe walks into the modest offices of AllSafe Cybersecurity, as announced by the boring, corporate logo.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): But I'm only a vigilante hacker by night. By day, just a regular cyber security engineer, employee number ER28-0652.\n\nINT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - GIDEON\u2019S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS\nThe AllSafe boss, GIDEON GODDARD (40s), a bearded metrosexual with adult braces stands while ANGELA (20s), a blonde girl-nextdoor trapped in the prim and proper veneer of a private school upbringing, looks at him sternly. Gideon shouts through his glass doors:\n\nGIDEON: Elliot, in here!\n\n[indistinct chatter]\n\nAngela: ...All over the price. Yeah, I can totally, I can totally handle it.\n\nGIDEON: Look--\n\nElliot nervously walks in, curiously looking at Angela who pretends he\u2019s not even there. Gideon passes a file to him.\n\nGIDEON: They were hacked again. Last night.\n\nANGELA: Gideon--\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): That's my childhood friend Angela. She can be a bit high strung sometimes, but trust me she's one of the good ones.\n\nElliot looks over the notes.\nELLIOT: What am I looking at? Is this the log file? This was a RUDY attack.\nConcerned, Gideon nods. Elliot shakes his head, impressed more than he usually is.\n\nELLIOT: This is awesome.\n\nANGELA: Gideon, will you please answer me?\n\nGIDEON (to ELLIOT): Awesome? You think this is awesome? This is killing us, Elliot.\n\nANGELA: Gideon, I'm not leaving--\n\nGIDEON: Angela! Let's just see how this meeting goes today. Their networks are getting attacked every week. Who knows if they'll still even be a client.\n\nELLIOT: They\u2019re coming in?\n\nGideon\u2019s look confirms it. He looks at Elliot\u2019s hoodie.\n\nGIDEON: Hey, what did we say about the dress code?\n\nElliot sheds his hoodie, revealing an oversized, button-downed dress shirt underneath. He hates it.\n\nGIDEON: All right, now, look over those logs. And be ready this afternoon in case they have any questions. Okay?\n\nANGELA: Okay\n\nINT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - HALLWAYS\nElliot and Angela walk out. Elliot smells something on her.\n\nELLIOT: Start smoking again?\n\nANGELA (ignores his question): Did you not get my texts last night? I sent you exactly 13 of them.\n\nELLIOT: Yeah, I'm sorry. I couldn't make it.\n\nANGELA (looks at him): You promised me that you were gonna try this time.\n\nFLASHBACK\nLast night, Elliot nervously walks up to the entrance of a packed bar. Through the big windows outside he sees Angela, laughing, smiling, drinking with friends. Elliot\u2019s hand goes for the door, but his hand trembles--\n\nANGELA: Stop thinking about something else when I'm talking to you. I hate when you do that.\n\nELLIOT: Sorry, I was thinking about work.\n\nANGELA: Maybe that's why Gideon loves you so much. He thanks me all the time for bringing you in. But for some reason, I think you secretly hate it here.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): She was right. I liked most of the people, but our business--a cyber security firm that protects corporations--I can't think of anything I hate more.\n\nELLIOT: No, I love it here.\n\nElliot and Angela both chuckle.\n\nANGELA: I'm sorry. I'm just in a bad mood. I'm late on my last two student loan payments, and I can't get Gideon to give me a raise.\n\nA slick, good-looking white man named OLLIE (20s) walks up and kisses Angela.\n\nOLLIE (to Angela): Hey.\n\nANGELA (to Ollie): Hi.\n\nOLLIE (to Elliot): Yo, buddy. Missed you last night. Where were you?\n\nELLIOT: Gotta go, big meeting today.\n\nElliot doesn\u2019t wait for a response, he disappears into the maze of cubicles quickly.\n\nOLLIE (to Angela): Did you find out what happened?\n\nANGELA: Yeah. He said he was working.\n\nOLLIE (not buying it): Oh, come on. You gotta talk to him.\n\nANGELA (rolls her eyes): We\u2019re gonna be late for the staff meeting.\n\nOLLIE: He can't stand me. And you know why. Angela, I can't have that kind of negativity in my life--\n\nAngela glares at him. Ollie points.\n\nOLLIE: That's exactly what I'm talking about.\n\nEXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY\nElliot shiftlessly walks through the streets once again, big bookbag in tow. His eyes wander around in paranoia. He continues to eat his McDonald\u2019s fries from the bag.\nINT. PSYCHOLOGIST\u2019S OFFICE - DAY\n\nHe sits across from his psychologist, KRISTA (30s-40s), a slender African-American woman who tries too hard at youth with a short dress.\n\nThey\u2019re looking at each other in silence.\n\nKRISTA: What are you thinking about?\n\nELLIOT: Nothing.\n\nKRISTA: Wanna know what I\u2019m thinking about? The first time you came to me.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): I didn't exactly come to Krista. I was forced here. But I do like her. Hacking her was simple. Her password: Dylan 2791. Favorite artist and the year in which she was born, backwards. Though she's a psychologist, she's really bad at reading people. But I'm good at reading people. My secret: I look for the worst in them.\n\nINSERT: Krista\u2019s Gmail and Facebook. We land on her eHarmony profile.\n\nELLIOT (V.O): I know she went through a divorce four years ago. I know she was devastated by it and has been dating losers on eHarmony ever since.\n\nINSERT: A profile pic of a salt and pepper handsome gent. He\u2019s a nice fellow with a middle-aged face and a welcoming smile. His name is listed as Michael Hansen.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Her most recent foray Michael Hansen. I searched for him online, but nothing came up. No LinkedIn, no Facebook, nothing. Something about him bugs me, scratching that part of my mind again. But I'll hack him soon enough. I always do.\n\nBack to the scene. Elliot eyes Krista.\n\nKRISTA: I know you're not yelling like before, which is good. But I can tell you're still holding on to it. And we need to work on your anger issues, Elliot. You're angry at everyone, at society--\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Fuck society.\n\nKRISTA: I know you have a lot to be angry about, but keeping it to yourself and staying quiet like you're doing it's not going to help you. There's pain underneath. That's where our work needs to go.\n\nElliot says nothing. Krista leans forward.\n\nKRISTA: What is it about society that disappoints you so much?\n\nElliot holds back as his eyes wander to the Apple insignia glowing off of Krista\u2019s laptop on her desk.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Oh, I don't know. Is it that we collectively thought Steve Jobs was a great man, even when we knew he made billions off the backs of children?\nHis eyes shift to the glass framed Tour De France poster hanging on the wall featuring Lance Armstrong.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Or maybe it\u2019s that it feels like all our heroes are counterfeit, the world itself just one big hoax.\nHis eyes refocus on the reflection of the glass frame, seeing that Krista\u2019s browser from her laptop is on Twitter.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Spamming each other with our running commentary of bullshit masquerading as insight, our social media faking as intimacy.\n\nKrista still eyes Elliot, waiting for him to respond. He returns his stare back at her, noticing the \u201cI voted\u201d sticker on her blouse.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Or is it that we voted for this? Not with our rigged elections--\n\nHis eyes now notice the expensive accessories of Krista. Her earrings, watch, shoes, her Hunger Games book in her bag.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): But with our things, our property, our money. I'm not saying anything new. We all know why we do this, not because Hunger Games books makes us happy--\n\nKrista crosses her legs, still waiting on Elliot to respond. That\u2019s when Elliot spots a prescription bottle next to Krista\u2019s purse on her desk chair.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): But because we wanna be sedated. Because it\u2019s painful not to pretend, because we\u2019re cowards. Fuck society.\n\nKRISTA (echoing): Elliot. You\u2019re not saying anything, what\u2019s wrong?\nHe finally responds to Krista.\n\nELLIOT: Nothing.\n\nKrista collects herself, frustrated she\u2019s getting nowhere.\n\nELLIOT: Don\u2019t be frustrated.\n\nKRISTA (confused): Why shouldn\u2019t I be?\n\nELLIOT: You\u2019re different than most. You at least try. You at least understand.\n\nKRISTA (intrigued): Understand what?\n\nELLIOT: What it's like to feel alone. You understand the pain. You want to protect people from it. You want to protect me from it. I respect that about you.\n\nLong silence.\nKRISTA: Why do you think I know what it's like to feel alone?\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Shit! From her emails!\n\nKRISTA: Elliot?\n\nELLIOT: I don\u2019t know.\n\nKrista lets it go.\n\nKRISTA: Let's talk about last night. Did you go to Angela's birthday party?\n\nFLASHBACK: Last night, we pick up where we left off. Elliot\u2019s hand trembles as he reaches for the door to the bar. He sweats as he closes his eyes and tries to force himself to go in, but can\u2019t. The door opens, three people file out. Elliot quickly moves out of the way, avoiding physical contact at all costs. He takes a breath and looks through the windows again. Angela is happy, surrounded by friends, enjoying her birthday. Ollie walks up to her. They kiss. This is enough for Elliot to wrap his head in his hoodie and walk away--\n\nBack to the scene.\n\nELLIOT: Yeah. It was nice.\n\nKRISTA: Did you try to talk to anyone?\n\nELLIOT: Sure. I got a girl\u2019s number.\n\nKRISTA (impressed): You did?\n\nELLIOT (chuckles): She\u2019s cute. She likes the Hunger Games.\n\nKRISTA (back to being suspicious): You're hiding again, Elliot. When you hide, your delusions come back. It's a slippery slope. Let's talk about the men in black you've been seeing. Are they still there?\n\nELLIOT: No, I told you they're gone. The meds you gave me are working.\n\nINT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - CUBICLE - LATER\nElliot types away at his computer. He glances up and notices Ollie approaching.\n\nOLLIE: Yo man. Do you wanna--\n\nElliot reluctantly takes off his headphones.\n\nOLLIE: Uh, do you wanna do lunch today?\n\nELLIOT: Uh yeah, I got other plans--\n\nOLLIE: Other plans. Right. That\u2019s what you said the last three times I asked you.\n\nOllie looks around.\n\nOLLIE: Look, bud, you and Angela have been close for a long time, and that's even more reason why I want us to be on good terms. I - I just I feel like things have been awkward between us. Don't you?\n\nELLIOT: I\u2019m okay with it being awkward between us.\n\nOLLIE (awkwardly laughs): Um, yeah. I - I - I\u2019m not okay with that.\n\nOLLIE (more sympathetic tone): Um look, man, I love Angela, and I want us to to get along for her sake. I mean, that's what I'm that's what I'm here for. I just, I - I don't normally do stuff\n\nAs Ollie drones on again, Elliot\u2019s stream of consciousness interrupts:\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Am I that crazy not to like this guy? Among some of his Facebook likes are--\n\nINSERT: Ollie\u2019s Facebook profile and likes.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): George W. Bush\u2019s Decision Points, Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, and the music of Josh Groban. Must I really justify myself any further?\nBack to scene.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): His was the easiest to hack. Password was 123456Seven.\n\nINSERT: Ollie\u2019s Gmail account.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): I witnessed his first \"I love you\" with Angela over Gchat.\n\nINSERT: Profile pic of a trashy woman named Stella B.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Then I witnessed the first of many infidelities with Stella B.\n\nBack to the scene. Ollie\u2019s still in the midst of his phony plea.\n\nOLLIE: ...I've never done anything like this before.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): I've thought about telling Angela, but she has shitty taste in men, and I'm not quite ready to see what comes after this just yet.\n\nOLLIE: ...You like music. I like music. Maroon 5.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Plus I can manage Ollie easier than the others. For now, anyway.\n\nOLLIE: And that's all I mean. I just want you to know that. I like you, bro, and I want you to like me too.\n\nELLIOT: I understand. I\u2019ll try harder.\n\nOLLIE: That's cool, man. Hey, whenever you're ready, I'd love to just...chill--\n\nHe puts his arm on Elliot\u2019s shoulder-- but Elliot, not comfortable with the physical contact, shifts his shoulder away.\n\nOLLIE: Oh, forgot about your no touching thing.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Truth is, I shouldn't hate Ollie; he's not that bad a guy. He's too dumb to be bad. In fact, when I think about the really bad people--\n\nAs if sensing it, Elliot peeks out of his cubicle. He sees a handful of business SUITS at the front. The SUITS head towards Gideon\u2019s office.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): E Corp, the largest conglomerate in the world. They're so big, they're literally everywhere.\n\nE Corp\u2019s logo, which looks like the Enron \u201cE\u201d logo, is shown on all the products inside of the office: desktops, smartphones, laptops.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): A perfect monster of modern society. The E might as well stand for Evil.\n\nAn advertisement plays on a television and displays some of E Corp\u2019s ventures. Agriculture, electronics, medicine, construction.\nELLIOT (V.O.): In fact, after a thorough, intensive self-reprogramming, that's all my mind hears, sees, or reads when they pop up in my world.\n\nINSERT: E Corp advertisement.\n\nWOMAN: That's what we have to offer. Together, we can change the world with E Corp--\n\nINSERT: Replace E Corp logo with Evil Corp logo\n\nELLIOT (V.O.):  Krista would have a shit fit if she knew I did that. But that\u2019s what they are...a conglomerate of evil. And now I have to help them.\n\nGideon and the team of SUITS walk up next to Elliot\u2019s cubicle.\n\nGIDEON: There are six on-site engineers on your account. Plus a few off-site.\n\nElliot sneaks a peek at the head suit, Steve Ballmer with a full mane of hair.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): There he is, Terry Colby, the CTO.\n\nTERRY COLBY looks around with a doofus smile.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Even though he's the head technology guy at one of the biggest companies in the world, he owns a Blackberry.\nElliot\u2019s eyes shift to Terry\u2019s Blackberry on his belt. Terry looks at Elliot\u2019s desktop with confusion.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): But also looks like he doesn't see a terminal very often. He's not a techie. He's a moron.\n\nThe suits, led by Gideon, keep on walking through the office.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): An arrogant moron. The worst kind.\n\nElliot focuses on his terminal, but a person from the pack walks up to him. He\u2019s good-looking, sharply dressed and has a rock star smile. His name is TYRELL WELLICK (30s). He reaches his hand out to Elliot. Elliot painfully takes it.\n\nTYRELL (thick Swedish accent): Oh, hi. Tyrell Wellick. I'm Senior Vice President, Technology.\n\nELLIOT: I\u2019m...Elliot. Just a tech.\n\nTYRELL: Don't be so humble. You know, I started out exactly where you are, and to be honest, you know, my heart is still there. [looking at his screen] So I see you're running Gnome. You know, I'm actually on KDE myself. I know this desktop environment is supposed to be better but you know what they say. Old habits they die hard.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): An executive running Linux with--\n\nTYRELL: Yeah, I know what you're thinking. I'm an executive. I mean why am I even running Linux? Again old habits. It's gonna be fun working with you. I should join the rest of the group. Bonsoir, Elliot.\nHe takes off with an earnest smile.\nElliot sits back down in his cubicle with a resigned sigh. He takes in his small three-walled cube universe amidst the thirty other identical cubes.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Sometimes I dream of saving the world.\n\nHis eyes look over at Lloyd who is busy paying a Verizon bill online.\n\nELLIOT(V.O.): Saving everyone from the invisible hand, one that brands us with an employee badge.\n\nElliot eyes his fellow employees sympathetically, all looking like enslaved serfs with their company badges hanging off them.\nEXT. NYC STREETS - NIGHT\nElliot walks through the streets alone as GROUPS OF FRIENDS laugh while walking in and out of bars. Credit cards are swiped, dollar-tips are thrown, a homeless man begs for change.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): The one that forces us to work for them. The one that controls us every day without us knowing it. But I can\u2019t stop it. I\u2019m not that special.\n\nINT. ELLIOT\u2019S LOFT - NIGHT\n\nElliot enters his messy small loft.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): I'm just anonymous. I'm just alone.\n\nElliot makes his way over to a fishbowl, swimming inside is a black fish named QWERTY.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): If it weren't for Qwerty, I'd be completely empty.\n\nMOMENTS LATER\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): I hate when I can't hold in my loneliness. This crying has been happening too often, every other week now. What do normal people do when they get this sad? They reach out to friends or family, I think.\n\nINT. ELLIOT\u2019S HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - DAY\nA YOUNG ELLIOT (8) sits at the kitchen table. His MOTHER (30s), pretty but cold. Buttoned up, a short haircut, and expressionless face. She methodically smokes a cigarette. Young Elliot looks like he\u2019s been scolded. His mother grabs his arms and slams them down on the table.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.) : That\u2019s not an option.\n\nINT. ELLIOT\u2019S LOFT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER\nElliot crushes up morphine pills. He puts the crushed powder on a small glass table and cuts it with a credit card.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): I do morphine.\n\nINT. ELLIOT\u2019S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER\nElliot snorts up a line of morphine. He lies back down on the floor as it takes effect. He sprawls out on his couch, staring at Qwerty as it takes effect.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): The key to doing morphine without turning into a junkie is to limit yourself to 30 milligrams a day. Anything more just builds up your tolerance. I check every pill I get for purity. I have 8 milligram Suboxone for maintenance in case I go through withdrawals--\n\nElliot\u2019s eyes shift from Qwerty to an empty prescription bottle.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Shit! I\u2019m out again.\n\nHe reaches out for it in disbelief.\nMOMENTS LATER\nSHAYLA (20s), a hipster girl, steps into the room. She slides an orange bottle full of pills.\n\nELLIOT: How much?\n\nSHAYLA: On the house.\n\nELLIOT: No Shayla, not doing that. Okay? This is just a regular drug deal, like it always is.\n\nElliot offers her cash. Shayla resigns herself and takes it.\n\nSHAYLA: So what are you you to tonight? 'Cause I tried to post something on your Facebook and couldn't find you.\n\nELLIOT: I\u2019m not on Facebook.\n\nSHAYLA: What? Why not?\n\nELLIOT: \u2018Cause I hate Facebook.\n\nSHAYLA (offended): That\u2019s crazy.\n\nElliot shoots her a look, \u201cI guess I\u2019m crazy.\u201d Disappointed, Shayla playfully pulls out two white pills from her pocket.\n\nSHAYLA: Well you want to do these together then? Pure Molly.\n\nThe last line piques Elliot\u2019s interest, though his look is already regretting the decision.\nINT. ELLIOT\u2019S LOFT - LATER\nElliot lies naked in his bed, smoking a joint, while a nude Shayla lies next to him, fast asleep. He wears a dumb look.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Don't ever make decisions when you're on morphine.\n\nHis cell beeps. He looks at it.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Instagram check-in for Krista at Pierre Loti. Okay, Michael Hansen. Time to find out who you really are.\n\nEXT. PIERRE LOTI - NIGHT\nElliot, in a hoodie, walks by Pierre Loti across the street. He doesn\u2019t walk towards it, instead he stays put, lurking around the corner.\n\nElliot looks around the city block he\u2019s standing on. In the distance, a late night diner shows two MEN IN BLACK having coffee. Elliot hides in the shadows, watching them.\nEXT. PIERRE LOTI - AWHILE LATER\nElliot\u2019s spies Michael from across the street as he watches him kiss Krista goodbye. They part ways.\n\nMichael hails a cab. Elliot snaps a picture of the number on top of Michael\u2019s cab as it takes off. He quickly pulls out his cell phone and dials.\n\nELLIOT (into the phone): Uh, hi I just left my keys in one of your cabs. 56Y2. Sure.\n\nSuddenly, the MR. ROBOT bum from the subway walks up to their table, begging for money. Elliot shoots a confused look-- but gets interrupted when the operator returns.\n\nELLIOT: 306 Hawthorne. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nHe hangs up and returns his gaze back to the two MEN IN BLACK. Mr. Robot is nowhere to be seen. He lets it go for now and returns to the task at hand.\nEXT. 306 HAWTHORNE AVENUE - LATER\nElliot walks up and sees the cab, waiting by the curb. On the stoop in front of 306 Hawthorne, Michael begrudgingly walks his dog. It\u2019s as if Michael has completely dropped his cheery, nice guy act.\n\nMICHAEL: Come on, asshole, piss already! Come on!\n\nHe jerks the dog by his leash, causing him to YELP.\n\nElliot charges from across the street.\n\nThe cowed dog looks up sheepishly at Michael as it nervously paces around the small patch of grass.\n\nMICHAEL: Come on! Will you will you go? - Come on, go, go!\n\nHe yanks the dog into the air by the leash, when Elliot finally gets there--\n\nELLIOT: Hey!\n\nMICHAEL: Go, will ya?\n\nThe dog yelps again.\n\nELLIOT: Hey!\n\nMichael stops and turns. Elliot looks at the dog with sympathy, but then back at Michael.\n\nELLIOT: May I borrow your phone? Mine's dead. I need to call my mom.\n\nMichael reluctantly nods and pulls out his cell. He slides it unlocked with his passcode and hands it to him.\n\nELLIOT: Thank you.\n\nElliot takes it, immediately memorizing all the apps on his homescreen, specifically the E Corp app.\n\nHe dials his own number and calls. From within Elliot\u2019s back pocket, we see his phone light up and vibrate.\n\nElliot gets his own voicemail. He hangs up, quickly deletes his call log and looks back at Michael.\n\nELLIOT: No answer. Thanks anyway.\n\nMichael takes his phone back with a shrug.\nEXT. NYC SUBWAY - LATER\nElliot walks out of the subway station, smoking a joint. His phone immediately vibrates. He looks at it with a question, then answers.\n\nELLIOT: Angela, is everything okay?\n\nINTERCUT WITH:\nINT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - CUBICLE\nAngela stands apart from Lloyd, who is desperately trying to tackle a tech issue on his desktop.\n\nANGELA (into the phone, discreet): I need you to come to AllSafe.\n\nELLIOT: You're there? It's three in the morning.\n\nANGELA: They attacked Evil Corp servers again, but it's bad this time. It's a DDoS attack.\n\nELLIOT: Did you call Lloyd? He's on call.\n\nANGELA: Yeah, he's here.\n\nELLIOT: Is he talking to their tech department?\n\nANGELA: He's online with them, but so far nothing. I don't think that Lloyd can handle this. Look, Gideon just put me on this account. I can't screw up in my first week. I need you. Please.\n\nElliot looks back into the subway. He tosses his joint.\nINT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - NIGHT\nElliot races in. Angela walks up to him, panicking.\n\nANGELA: Finally!\n\nELLIOT: Calm down, it\u2019s only been an hour.\n\nANGELA: Yeah, well, an hour in Evil Corp time is like $13 million in revenue, approximately. Actually, I calculated that. That's exactly how much they lost.\n\nELLIOT: Don\u2019t worry, I got you.\n\nThey approach Lloyd who is sweating bullets in his cubicle.\n\nELLIOT: Lloyd, what\u2019s up?\n\nNo response, Lloyd is locked in on his terminal.\n\nLLOYD: Elliot. This is bad. Worst DDoS attack I've ever seen.\n\nELLIOT: Did you reconfigure the DNS?\n\nLLOYD: Yes!\n\nELLIOT: Stop the services.\n\nLLOYD: I already stopped the services, tries to reboot the servers but they're not coming back up. Dude, someone is straight up fingerblasting their entire network right now.\n\nElliot types furiously on his desktop, navigating Evil Corp\u2019s\nservers.\nAngela checks her phone.\n\nANGELA: They just started reporting on the outage.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Shit. This is worse than I thought. They\u2019re in the network.\n\nElliot types away as Gideon walks in. Even though he\u2019s angry, he keeps his cool. He sees Elliot, then faces Angela.\n\nGIDEON: What's the status update? See here. I thought we set up security protocols - so that this doesn't happen. Where\u2019s the attack coming from?\n\nELLIOT: Everywhere, obviously. - The USA, Finland, Thailand, Kuwait--\n\nGIDEON: Start restarting the services, load sharing, redirect the traffic--and call Prolexic for help.\n\nELLIOT: Wait.\n\nGIDEON: What?\n\nELLIOT: I don't think this is just a DDoS attack. I think they got a rootkit sitting inside the servers.\n\nANGELA: What\u2019s a rootkit?\n\nLLOYD: It's like a crazy serial rapist with a very big dick.\n\nANGELA: Jesus, Lloyd!\n\nLLOYD: Sorry. It's malicious code that completely takes over their system. It can delete system files and stop programs. Viruses, worms--\n\nANGELA: How do we stop it?\n\nLLOYD: That's the thing. It's fundamentally invisible you can't stop it. All of their servers are timing out. None of them are coming back up.\n\nElliot moves to Lloyd\u2019s terminal to check something.\n\nELLIOT: That's because every time we restart the server the virus replicates itself during boot up and crashes the host.\n\nLLOYD: How are we supposed to bring up the network if we can't restart the servers?\n\nELLIOT: We can't. Which is what they wanted. By defending ourselves, we ended up spreading the virus everywhere.\n\nEveryone exchanges tense looks. Gideon tries to contain himself as he already knows what follows.\n\nELLIOT: Only thing we can do is we've gotta take the whole system offline, wipe the infected servers clean, then bring them back up.\n\nGIDEON: You\u2019re coming with me.\n\nELLIOT (whispers): Yeah.\n\nGIDEON: Lloyd. Tell everybody to start taking everything offline.\n\nLLOYD: Got it.\n\nGIDEON (on the phone): Uh, the server farm in Dulles. We're gonna need the jet.\n\nEXT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT\n\nGideon and Elliot speed walk towards a slick black sedan already waiting for them.\nINT. SERVER FARM - NIGHT\nElliot speed-walks into the loud WHIRRING of the large arrays of servers.\n\nGIDEON: They're booting the network back up. Now, you're downloading the logs, right because--\n\nELLIOT: Stop. Tell him to stop.\n\nGIDEON: What?\n\nELLIOT: Don't start the boot sequence. You guys missed one. There's an infected server up and running.\n\nElliot moves to the server display and points out  cs 30.\n\nELLIOT: What's the ETA before it hits this server? (Elliot)The backup server up and running?\n\nA spectating TECH nervously stares at the display and then Elliot before shrugging.\nElliot returns to the console and starts to furiously type.\n\nELLIOT: The backup server up and running?\n\nTECH: It's ready, but it's not configured for auto switch.\n\nElliot races towards the backup server, cs51. He finds it terminals in.\n\nELLIOT: We need to redirect the traffic, need to switch DNS.\n\nThe displays shows that the network is slowly coming back online, approaching the still-infected server, cs30.\n\nGIDEON: This is impossible.\n\nELLIOT: You got this, you got this, you got this.\n\nAs Elliot continues to type, nearly all the servers but cs30 and cs51 have come back online. He manages to switch the DNS to cs51 at the last second.\n\nELLIOT: We still up?\n\nGideon holds his breath and watches as the network boots up the backup server and then the remaining ones before letting it all out.\n\nGIDEON: We\u2019re okay.\n\nELLIOT: Yeah.\n\nGideon squats down to Elliot with a huge grin on his face. He proudly squeezes Elliot\u2019s shoulder. Elliot shies away from the contact.\n\nELLIOT: I'm gonna take a look at the infected server, okay? Give me a minute.\n\nGIDEON (put off): Yeah. Uh I'll meet you at the elevators.\n\nThe spectators disperse along with Gideon. Elliot continues to furiously type.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): They must have left a mark or something. Every hacker loves attention. They don't just do DDoS attacks for no reason.\n\nThat\u2019s when Elliot stumbles upon a data file in the terminal that reads simply: fsociety00.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): This is it. Fsociety. Is that supposed to be a joke? This was way too easy. They didn't hide it well at all.\n\nHe /dir\u2019s it and a flurry of files go flying by, the last one being README.TXT. He opens it. It reads simply: leavemehere.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): This note is for me. They're telling me to leave it here. But why? Doesn't matter. Time to shut them down.\n\nElliot can\u2019t bring himself to delete the rootkit.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Why can't I delete it? I don't want to delete it. I want it to stay. What's wrong with me?\n\nElliot nervously looks around before he cancels the delete command.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): I'll reconfigure the access to the root directory so only I can use it. And no one will know.\n\nINT. PRIVATE JET (MOVING) - DAWN\nExhausted, Elliot and Gideon sit silently together. Though Elliot is used to the all-nighters, Gideon isn\u2019t. He has a glass of wine as he sits back, deep in thought.\n\nGIDEON: Did you know that I'm gay?\n\nELLIOT: Um...no.\n\nAfter an awkward pause, Gideon uncomfortably nods.\n\nGIDEON: Consider this me coming out to you then, okay? It's hard because I don't like to talk about my sex life. But my partner, he gets very paranoid. He thinks I'm ashamed of-- he wants me to be more public about it. So. Anyway, I'm gay.\n\nELLIOT (awkward pause): Thanks.\n\nGideon: Yeah.\n\nDeep in thought again, Gideon takes a deep breath. Elliot notices the troubled look on his face.\n\nELLIOT: Hey, man, don't worry about it. Hackers have a short attention span. They'll get bored, harass someone else--\n\nGIDEON: Evil Corp is thinking about leaving us. And I don't know if I can blame them...\n\nGideon takes another sip of his wine and leans back in his chair. He shakes his head.\n\nELLIOT: They could have called their other security teams.\n\nGIDEON: Mm.\n\nELLIOT: They called you.\n\nGIDEON: Well, somebody over there likes us, but Terry Colby, he's getting the pressure. And he calls the shots. Evil Corp is 80% of our business. If we lose them, it's gonna be it for us. It's gonna be it--for me.\n\nThey both sit in silence for a moment. Gideon looks over.\n\nGIDEON: I feel like I can talk to you. I mean, more than the others, anyway.\n\nThey share a comfortable moment this time.\n\nGIDEON: I'm sure, in a weird way, you'll be happy if we went under. Oh, come on. Come on. I know you hate wearing those stupid shirts.\n\nELLIOT: Gideon? I promise I'll find them.\n\nINT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - DAY\nElliot\u2019s drained face stares stoically out, trying to piece together the mystery of the recent hacks.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Evil Corp service should be back up soon enough. I'll take a look at the dat file. I'll ask my IRC contacts about fsociety when I get home. I've never seen their name on the boards though. They've gotta be new, but they're good--\n\nElliot\u2019s train of thought is interrupted when Mr. Robot sits across from him, donning the same gas attendant shirt.\n\nMR. ROBOT: Rough night?\n\nShocked, Elliot\u2019s eyes grow large.\n\nMR. ROBOT: I'm getting off here. I think you should come with me. But only if you didn't delete it. You deleted it, we got nothing to talk about.\n\nMr. Robot stands and waits by the doors. Elliot sits there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do at all.\n\nELLIOT: Are you talking to me?\n\nMr. Robot says nothing, but the empty car states the obvious. The subway finally screeches to a halt. Elliot reamins seated as it stops. Mr. Robot walks off the subway. Elliot sits there for a moment, wondering if he should follow him as the doors close. He does.\nPLATFORM - CONTINUOUS\nMr. Robot sits on the other side of the station. Elliot slowly walks over and sits next to him.\n\nELLIOT: Who are you?\n\nMR. ROBOT: We gotta wait for the Q.\n\nELLIOT: Then what?\n\nMR. ROBOT: Then we're going to Brooklyn. Out by Coney Island.\n\nELLIOT: Why? What\u2019s there.\n\nMr. Robot is silent for a moment, taking a deep breath as he looks at Elliot.\n\nMR. ROBOT: Obviously you're gonna ask a lot of questions. It's weird what you're doing right now, I get it. I-I can't tell you anything until we get there.\n\nMr. Robot pulls out a cigarette and lights it.\n\nELLIOT: Can't smoke in here.\n\nMr. Robot ignores him.\n\nELLIOT: You've been following me. Why? What do you want from me?\n\nMR. ROBOT: My dad was a petty thief. Never could hold down a job. So, he just robbed, convenience stores, shops, small-time stuff. One time, he sat me down, he told me something I never forgot. He said, \"Everyone steals. That's how it works. You think people out there are getting exactly what they deserve? No. They're getting paid over or under, but someone in the chain always gets bamboozled. I steal, son, but I don't get caught. That's my contract with society. Now if you can catch me stealing, I'll go to jail. But if you can't, then I've earned the money. \" I respected that, man. I thought that shit was cool as a little kid. A few years after that, they finally caught him. Sent him to jail. Dies five years later. My respect goes with him. I thought he was free doing what he did, but he wasn't. He was in prison. Just like you are now, Elliot. But I'm gonna break you out.\n\nElliot shoots him a quiet, puzzled look. Mr. Robot puts on a pair of sunglasses, smiles big and then stares ahead.\nEXT. CONEY ISLAND - STREETS - DAY\nAn impoverished, ghetto block. Elliot cautiously follows Mr. Robot down the street. An old Ferris wheel can be seen slowly spinning in the distance.\n\nThey finally reach a rundown, closed up arcade. The sign reads: FUN SOCIETY ARCADE (but the U and N are missing/faded). Robot walks up to the back door, gesturing Elliot to follow him.\nTHE BACK - CONTINUOUS\nMr. Robot opens the backdoor. Blue, green, and gray Ethernet cables run from all sides of the door. The sound of KEYBOARD STROKES emanates from within. ROMERO (50s) - a long, gray-haired hippie with a fanny pack - opens the door. He looks over Elliot before going back inside. Mr. Robot walks in. Elliot follows.\nINT. FSOCIETY ARCADE - CONTINUOUS\nAn arcade with very little working games left. Using fallen games as tables for computers, four hackers type away: MOBLEY (30s) - an obese man with shaggy hair. TRENTON (16) - a Muslim girl hunched over at a terminal. DARLENE (20s) - an aggressive yet striking hipster who chain smokes. She wears a fur coat and blue Ray Bans.\n\nELLIOT: Why would you guys actually meet IRL?\n\nNone of them look up, all of them with earbuds plugged in as they type away. Silence fills the room. Mr. Robot gestures for Elliot to follow him around the corner, into the center of the arcade.\n\nMR. ROBOT: You remember that hacker group O-Megz? They got outed by their own leader to the FBI, and six hackers went to prison for it? You know how they got 'em?\n\nMr. Robot walks over to the popcorn machine and starts eating straight out of it.\n\nMR. ROBOT: They went on the dude's computer, tracked 'em all down through emails, VPN sessions, chat messages, texts. One guy, and the whole thing comes down. It's what's called--\n\nELLIOT: A central point of failure.\n\nMR. ROBOT: Right. Because they refused to meet in person, they compromised each other every time they sent so much as a smiley face. The rule here is, it's done here, and only here. It ends when you walk out that door, and begins when you walk in. Our encryption is the real world.\n\nELLIOT: How do you talk to each other then?\n\nMr. Robot walks over to the kitchen sink and pours himself water from the tap.\n\nMR. ROBOT: We don't. We come and go, work on the project when we can.\n\nELLIOT (discreet): How do you trust them?\n\nMR. ROBOT: How do you trust them? - I give them an exercise. If they pass, they join us. If they fail...\n\nELLIOT: The DDoS attack last night...you were testing me.\n\nMr. Robot takes off his jacket as he sits down and smiles yes. Elliot peers back to the hackers.\n\nELLIOT: You said there was a project.\n\nMR. ROBOT (nods):That'll come later. I just wanted you to see the place.\n\nMr. Robot starts typing away. Elliot stands there, unsure of how to proceed.\n\nMR. ROBOT: There's not much you can do without a CPU.\n\nINT. NYC SUBWAY (MOVING) - MORNING\nA visibly unnerved Elliot sits in silence.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): I'm crazy. I have to be crazy because that didn't just happen, right? This is a delusion. Is this a delusion? Shit, I'm a schizo.\n\nINT. NYC STREETS - DAY\nElliot doesn\u2019t walk the streets so carefully this time, as his mind swims in the mystery of what he just witnessed.\n\nELLIOT: Have I really lost it this time? No, no. Last night happened. It was real. Angela called me. I was at AllSafe. Evil Corp's servers were compromised. Those are facts, not delusions. I know. I know, I know I realize I'm saying all of this to an imaginary person, but I created you. I didn't create this.\n\nEXT. ELLIOT\u2019S APARTMENT BUILDING - STEPS - DAY\nElliot walks to his building and sees Angela sitting outside on the steps, waiting for him. She stands when she sees him.\n\nANGELA: Oh, thank God you're here. I was just about to go wait in the Starbucks. You live in a bad neighborhood. Do you know that?\n\nELLIOT: I do know that.\n\nShe shows him a BACK TO THE FUTURE II DVD.\n\nANGELA: Do you want to get high and watch your favorite movie? Oh, you saved our asses last night. I thought Gideon was definitely gonna fire me. Where have you been? I thought you'd be sleeping.\n\nELLIOT: I--yeah, I fell asleep on the train.\n\nANGELA (skeptical): That sounds like such a lie, but, whatever. I don't want to get into that right now. So you want to do this? I miss Qwerty, I hope she still loves me.\n\nINT. ELLIOT\u2019S LOFT\nElliot unlocks the door and they walk into the apartment. They share an awkward moment as they see Shayla, naked, asleep on Elliot\u2019s bed.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Shit.\n\nELLIOT: She wasn't supposed to be here, okay? - Give me a minute and I'll get rid of her.\n\nANGELA: That\u2019s okay. Um...this is great. Elliot, I\u2019m happy for you.\n\nELLIOT: No, it\u2019s not like that.\n\nANGELA: Well, maybe it should be, you know? It's good that you're dating.\n\nElliot reluctantly nods in defeat.\n\nANGELA: Well, I'll see you on Monday. We can do movie night next time. I promise, okay?\n\nELLIOT: Yeah.\n\nANGELA: Have fun.\n\nElliot nods as she walks out the door. Frustrated, he opens the door and slams it shut to wake Shayla.\nShayla stirs awake as he walks towards the bed.\n\nSHAYLA: Elliot? Oh, shit. Is it Wednesday?\n\nELLIOT: Shayla--\n\nSHAYLA: I have to move my car.\n\nELLIOT: Shayla, leave. NOW.\n\nINT. ELLIOT\u2019S LOFT - DAY\nINSERT: Google, 4chan, message boards, blogs, news sites, etc.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): No mention of Mr. Robot anywhere. No mention of fsociety. Not on any of the hacker boards. Not on IRC, forums, blogs, no one's heard of them.\n\nINSERT: Google maps on the fsociety arcade.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Property was owned by Fun Society Amusement, LLC for 13 years. Owner was shot a killed a year and a half ago. No owner since. And the ownership history before that is sparse to nonexistent. This guy is good. Very good. Doesn't matter. Their arcade network's IP is in the dat file. That'll be enough to turn them in.\n\nElliot prints out the incriminating pages and files them in a blue manila envelope. Elliot sits back down, looking at the Google Maps picture of the fsociety arcade. The temptation is too strong, he cracks.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): What\u2019s your ask, Mr. Robot?\n\nEXT. CONEY ISLAND STREETS - LATER\nElliot, carrying his bulky bookbag, walks through the slums of Coney Island, back to the fsociety arcade.\n\nOutside, Darlene stands outside the back door and smokes. She has the thick fur coat on to protect her from the cold air.\n\nElliot enters through the metal gate and walks up to her. She doesn\u2019t say anything to him.\n\nELLIOT: Hey man, where\u2019s your boss?\n\nDarlene shoots him an odd look.\n\nDARLENE: Okay, cut the bullshit. When are you going to give us access to the root directory?\n\nELLIOT: What?\n\nDARLENE: Dude, come on. I wrote that rootkit. I still have to put Colby's IP in the .dat file.\n\nDarlene shakes her head with disgust and flicks her cigarette.\n\nDARLENE: Dickhead.\n\nShe walks towards the back door, leaving Elliot perplexed. Mr. Robot enters from the street, holding a grocery bag full of goodies.\n\nMR. ROBOT: Elliot! Good news. I scored the last bag of Twinkies from Gristedes. You want one?\n\nELLIOT: She just called me a dickhead.\n\nMR. ROBOT (smiles): Yeah, that's Darlene.\n\nMr. Robot gestures towards the Ferris wheel.\n\nMR. ROBOT: Hey, you like Ferris wheels?\n\nEXT. CONEY ISLAND - FERRIS WHEEL - DAY\nElliot and Mr. Robot stand in a slow-moving, empty Ferris wheel car as it does its circular motion up. Mr. Robot looks down at the abandoned area with a grin, eating a twinkie.\n\nMR. ROBOT: Ah, it's beautiful. Gets better the higher up you go, you know? Oh, I love it up here. You like it?\n\nELLIOT: I'm here to tell you I'm turning you in. I'm giving them all the information--\n\nMR. ROBOT: Let me tell you why you're really here.\n\nConfused, Elliot says nothing.\n\nMR. ROBOT: You're here because you sense something wrong with the world. Something you can't explain. But you know it controls you and everyone you care about.\n\nELLIOT: What are you talking about?\n\nMR. ROBOT: Money. Money hasn't been real since we got off the gold standard. It's become virtual. Software. The operating system of our world. And, Elliot, we are on the verge of taking down this virtual reality. Think about it. What if you could take down one conglomerate? A conglomerate so deeply entrenched in the world's economy, that too big to fail doesn\u2019t even come close to describing it.\n\nELLIOT: You want to create another financial meltdown like the one we just had, but way worse. Yeah, why would I want that? Everyone would lose their money.\n\nMR. ROBOT: What if I told you that this conglomerate just so happens to own 70% of the global consumer credit industry? Huh? If we hit their data center just right, we could systematically format all the servers, including backup.\n\nELLIOT: That would erase all--\n\nMR. ROBOT: All the debt we owe them. Every record of every credit card, loan, and mortgage would be wiped clean. It would be impossible to reinforce outdated paper records. It would all be gone. The single biggest incident of wealth redistribution in history.\n\nElliot realizes what he\u2019s talking about. To underline this, he sees an Evil Corp logo proudly displayed on top of a building in the horizon.\n\nELLIOT: Evil Corp. The conglomerate. That's why you picked me. Because I work at AllSafe.\n\nMr. Robot reaches into a pocket and pulls out a slip of paper with an IP address.\n\nMR. ROBOT: Tomorrow, AllSafe is going to get a visit from the FBI and the U. S. Cyber Command. You are going to modify the dat file and put Colby's terminal IP address in there.\n\nELLIOT: Terry Colby? You're gonna frame him? No one's gonna believe that. I met him, he's a moron.\n\nMR. ROBOT: So are the FBI. Even if they don't believe he did it, they'll believe he gave someone access to it.\n\nELLIOT: Yeah, he'll just go to jail. What good will that do?\n\nMR. ROBOT: You don't take down a conglomerate by shooting them in the heart. That's the thing about conglomerates, they don't have hearts. You take them down limb by limb. And as they unravel, their illusion of control unravels.\n\nElliot takes a hard look at Mr. Robot, questioning his seemingly altruistic motives.\n\nELLIOT: Who are you?\n\nMr. Robot takes out a cigarette.\n\nMR. ROBOT: That'll come later. Right now, you have a lot to think about. You have to change the dat file and put Colby's IP in there. You do that, you have set in motion the largest revolution the world will ever see.\n\nElliot\u2019s look of doubt is all but whittled away.\nNeil Diamond\u2019s \u201cIf You Go Away\u201d plays\n\u201dIf you go away on this summer day\u201d\nINT. NYC SUBWAY STATION (MOVING) - NIGHT\nElliot can\u2019t contain the flurry of emotions as they flash across his face.\nSensing Elliot\u2019s excitement, a CHILD smiles at him.

ALLSAFE OFFICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER\n\u201dLike the empty look I see on your face\u201d\nGideon, Elliot, Lloyd, Angela, AllSafe account executives, FBI, and Evil Corp execs cramp the conference table. He nervously glances around the room, tensing up as Terry Colby and Tyrell Wellick walk in. Disappointedly, he pulls out the white envelope\nThe song stops playing after \u201cTill your next hello/If you go away...\u201d\n\nTERRY COLBY: So, what do we got?\n\nGIDEON: So, if you'll take a look at the first page of your agenda--\n\nEveryone flips over one page of their packet. Terry looks over at Elliot. Elliot nervously looks back.\n\nTERRY COLBY: You're the one who stopped the hack. You know, the gals in analysis said this was a tough one. All things being equal, it should have shut us down for days. So you did good.\n\nELLIOT (uncomfortable): Okay.\n\nGIDEON: We should start with our account executive, Angela.\n\nANGELA: Okay, we first noticed the breach at 2:07 A.M. Eastern Standard on Friday night--\n\nTERRY COLBY: You mean, Saturday?\n\nANGELA: Sorry, yes, technically, Saturday morning.\n\nTERRY COLBY (condescending): Yeah, okay, Angela, that's what we're here for. The technicals.\n\nNoting the condescension, Angela hides her anger.\n\nANGELA: Anyway, he arrived at the office at 2:35 and I instruct--\n\nTERRY COLBY: Okay, wait, wait, wait. So that's almost a half hour after the initial breach. Why didn't anyone pipe in from their laptops?\n\nANGELA: It\u2019s not protocol--\n\nELLIOT: It wouldn't have been secure if someone terminaled in on this. It was the smarter move to have someone come in - so they can log in on a secure line.\n\nANGELA (annoyed): Exactly. Then Lloyd was able to--\n\nTERRY COLBY: Just--just actually, just one second.\n\nTerry gestures to Tyrell. Tyrell leans in and Terry whispers something in his ear. Tyrell exchanges a glance with Gideon and they step outside the conference room. From the look on Gideon\u2019s face, it\u2019s not good. Angela looks like she\u2019s gonna flip out.\n\nTERRY COLBY: You know, I, uh, I always loved this view.\n\nAfter the brief exchange, Gideon returns to Angela\u2019s side, collects her papers, and walks her out of the conference room.\n\nTERRY COLBY (to Elliot): Now that that's taken care of, let's pick it up where we left off.\n\nELLIOT: What happened to Angela? She knows more about what happened.\n\nTERRY COLBY: She's not going to work out for us, not on this level. We need to stick to the more tech savvy here.\n\nElliot\u2019s eyes shift back and forth between the embarrassed Angela who is walking down the hallway, the blue manila envelope still in his bag and Terry Colby\u2019s curious look. Elliot instantly gains courage. He swaps the white manila for the blue.\n\nTyrell notes the envelope exchange.\n\nTERRY COLBY: Now, let's get to the heart of this thing because I can't sit here and look through a packet for the next 20 minutes. All right, just who did this? Is it that hard? Who did this?\n\nELLIOT: I found the configuration file of the rootkit with a pattern of IP addresses. Once you decrypt it, you'll know where the hack came from.\n\nCUT TO BLACK\nFADE IN\nINT. ELLIOT\u2019S LOFT - MORNING\nElliot hasn\u2019t slept and it shows.

Apartment 2C.\n\nELLIOT: Great.\n\nElliot inputs keywords based on Michael\u2019s responses for his command line program to run password checks with.\n\nELLIOT: And your security question, favorite baseball team?\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.): Um, Yankees. I don't remember this being a security question--\n\nELLIOT: And lastly, your pet's name?\n\nMICHAEL (O.S.): Um, Flipper. Who am I speaking to? Can I get your name and number--\n\nElliot disconnects and focuses on his command line program.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): With those details plus a dictionary brute-force attack, it'll take my program maybe two minutes to crack his password.\n\nWhile he waits, Elliot goes on Facebook and looks up Angela. He scans through the pictures of her and Ollie. Christmas vacations, Halloween, beach parties, barbecues, etc.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): What I wouldn't give to be normal. To live in that bubble, the reality of the naive.\n\nHe switches Facebook accounts to Krista, his therapist. More happy pictures.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): That's how I justify this. To keep their optimism intact. To protect them.\n\nHis password program BEEPS. He switches screens hurriedly and discovers the program didn\u2019t come up with a single match.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): How? He's too old to have a complicated password. It had to have been a combination of these things.\n\nElliot puts his head down and thinks.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): I'm missing something, I'm missing something, I'm missing something. Michael Hansen isn't his real name.\n\nHe slouches as he rocks back and forth in his chair. He looks up, realizing what he missed.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Michael Hansen isn\u2019t his real name.\n\nEXT. 306 HAWTHORNE AVENUE - NIGHT\nMichael walks down his street pushing a baby in a stroller. His WIFE walks next to him. They exchange words before she heads into the corner convenience store and he walks towards their apartment building, still pushing the stroller. We now see he\u2019s also walking Flipper, his dog. Elliot sits on his stoop, in his hoodie, smoking a cigarette, waiting for him.\n\nElliot\u2019s silhouette takes Michael by surprise.\n\nELLIOT: Lenny Shannon? Michael Hansen? Which one are you playing tonight? You're going to stop seeing Krista.\n\nThe sound of her name immediately makes Michael\u2019s eyes grow wide. Elliot stands and faces him.\n\nMICHAEL: What the fu--\n\nELLIOT: You're going to break up with her. You're never going to see her again.\n\nMICHAEL (recognizing him): You're the guy that used my phone--\n\nELLIOT: You cheated on your current wife with seven different women. I got digital proof of all of it.\n\nStunned, Michael remains still. His wife stands in line at the checkout.\n\nELLIOT: Ashley Madison, online escorts, fake Facebook pages. I own it all. And if you don't stop seeing her, your wife will know everything along with the police.\n\nMICHAEL: The police?\n\nELLIOT: Yeah, one of the escorts was 15.\n\nElliot shows Michael a picture of one of the escorts. Michael puts his head down with a wince.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): That 15 part I made up, but he did have a proclivity for young escorts that helped the lie.\n\nELLIOT: But I'm not gonna do any of that as long as you break up with Krista. Tonight.\n\nMichael looks up at him, now out of fear. His wife is putting away her wallet and is about to walk out.\n\nMICHAEL: Done.\n\nELLIOT: You're also gonna tell her the truth. That you're married, cheat on your wife, you hire hookers. That you never had any intention of being serious with her.\n\nMICHAEL: Why? That would destroy her. She thinks that...we're in love.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Exactly. Krista needs to avoid dickheads like you in the future. Her radar needs fixing.\n\nELLIOT: I'll know if you skip any detail. So don't.\n\nMichael nods quickly as his wife exits the store.\n\nELLIOT: And one more thing I\u2019m gonna need something from you.\n\nINT. ELLIOT\u2019S LOFT - NIGHT\nElliot brings Michael\u2019s dog, Flipper, home. He gives Flipper some dog food. The dog chows down happily.\n\nELLIOT: Hmm. I like you, Flipper. You're cool.\n\nMOMENTS LATER\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): I never want to be right about my hacks, but people always find a way to disappoint.\n\nElliot is on his computer burning a CD. The folder he\u2019s copying is called MICHAEL_HANSEN. Once the burn is complete, he pulls out a sharpie and labels it PINK FLOYD - WISH YOU WERE HERE.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): Michael Hansen now gets filed away among the others. Forever buried in my digital cemetery.\n\nHe grabs a large CD Case from underneath his bed and flips it open. Several other CDs labeled everything from the BEATLES to ZEPPELIN are in there. He files the newly fake-labeled CD and sends the envelope back under his bed. He jumps back on his computer and with a single keystroke deletes the Michael Hansen folder.\nINT. PSYCHOLOGIST\u2019S OFFICE - DAY\nElliot sits in his usual chair. He looks at Krista, who looks disheveled and completely out of it.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.): The look of disillusionment. He told her. She cried all night. Now comes the sadness. I don't like seeing her sad.\n\nELLIOT: You okay?\n\nKRISTA: Sorry. Sorry. Go on.\n\nELLIOT: I think Angela blames me for what happened at the Evil Corp meeting. What do I do? I need to talk to her.\n\nKRISTA: I think you just answered your own question. Talk to her.\n\nELLIOT: She won't respond to any of my texts or emails.\n\nKRISTA (pointed): Then go to her in person. Tell her you need to talk. Communication is key, Elliot. Real human interaction. That's what's important for you right now.\n\nElliot understands, he can\u2019t meet her eye contact.\nINT. ALLSAFE OFFICES - DAY\nElliot quickly walks into the office. Angela sees him and begins to walk away. He tries to catch up.\n\nELLIOT: Hey. Do you..do you think we can talk?\n\nANGELA: What?\n\nELLIOT: You won't talk to me. You haven't talked to me since the meeting.\n\nANGELA: I don't want to talk to you because I feel embarrassed every time I think about what happened. Okay? It's fine. I'll get over it.\n\nELLIOT: It\u2019s been three weeks--\n\nANGELA: I have to get back to work--\n\nELLIOT: You're just going to ignore me?\n\nANGELA: You didn't have to stick up for me in there. I know that you were just trying to help, just don't do it again. Even if I'm losing. Let me lose, okay? Don't look confused. Just say it. Okay?\n\nELLIOT: ...Okay.\n\nElliot nods. She puts her head down, disappointed in herself. Though this is awkward for him, Elliot slowly hugs her.\n\nANGELA: Elliot.\n\nA momentary hesitation as they eye each other. The moment quickly feels like it could be a kiss. But then Elliot and Angela realize eyes are looking at them. They slowly turn only to realize the entire office is looking at the television screens past the pair. Gideon steps in and umutes the television.\n\nON TV:\nTerry Colby is arrested by FBI and taken into custody. A MSNBC banner reads:\n\nBREAKING NEWS - TERRY COLBY ARRESTED - CTO of Evil Corp in custody after investigation into hacking scandal.\n\nElliot\u2019s eyes go wide.\nEXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY\nElliot walks down the street, no longer in a zombified, shiftless state-- but with life and purpose.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.) (incredulous): It\u2019s happening. It\u2019s happening. It\u2019s happening. It\u2019s happening.\n\nElliot stops in Times Square and looks at the TV\u2019s around him announcing news of the disastrous Evil Corp scandal. Pure amazement and joy begin to fill his face as he takes in the sight.\n\nELLIOT (V.O.) (incredulous): It\u2019s happening. It\u2019s happening. It\u2019s happening. It\u2019s happening.\n\nHe stretches his arms out like he\u2019s just won the gold--\n\nA MAN IN BLACK walks up to him. Elliot\u2019s smiles is long gone.\n\nMAN IN BLACK: Sir, step inside the car.\n\nOther MEN IN BLACK stand behind Elliot. Sweating immediately, Elliot even notices POLICE looking the other way.\n\nMAN IN BLACK: Sir. Get inside the vehicle. Now.\nHelpless, Elliot slowly climbs in. Their car, a black Escalade, peels out.\nEXT. NYC STREETS - DAY\nThe first MAN IN BLACK opens the door for Elliot to exit the car. They close him on all sides as they march towards a gargantuan skyscraper.\nINT. SKY RISE - ELEVATOR (MOVING) - DAY\nA nervous wreck, Elliot stands in the high speed elevator as it quickly climbs several stories into the air.\n\nThe elevator DINGS when it reaches the top floor. The doors open and Elliot looks out into the hall, pale as if he\u2019s facing the gallows.\n\nMAN IN BLACK: Go ahead.\n\nNervously, Elliot stares back at the MAN IN BLACK.\n\nMAN IN BLACK: Sir, go on in.\n\nElliot looks down the hall again, it assumes a dizzingly blurry form as we see silhouettes dance in the room at it\u2019s edge.\n\nMAN IN BLACK: Sir, go on in.\n\nINT. TOP FLOOR - CONTINUOUS\nElliot enters alone. He sees a number of MEN circle around a grand conference table. We only see their silhouettes, as they bicker and argue with one another.\nElliot\u2019s silhouette now joins them, dead center in the mess of black outlines.\n\nRealizing that Elliot has shown up, their loud arguing hushes into an abrupt silence. The dark shadows now face Elliot, who remains catatonic.\n\nWhat follows is the longest silence of Elliot\u2019s life as he and the dark faces exchange long, tense stares. No one speaks.\n\nOne blurred face leans forward, Tyrell Wellick. He\u2019s wearing a thin smile.\n\nTYRELL: Bonsoir, Elliot.\nELLIOT (V.O.): Please tell me you\u2019re seeing this too...\nCREDITS7Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

Lyrics[Verse 1: Brandon Flowers]\nThis snowman is shaping up to be an eight\nBut not out of ten\nThe robots awake to find that they've been taped down\nWondering when\nThey'll break through these chains\nBut little boys have action toys for brains\nI'm living proof it can last a long time\n\n[Verse 2: Brandon Flowers]\nNow the girls off the street are innocent and sweet\nWhen they're all in bed\nThey got their make-up and dreams of wonderland\nSprinkled inside their heads\nAnd soon they will change\nBut tonight, Hollywood has never seemed so strange\nNow mothers pray it'll last a long time\n[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]\nI want to roll around like a kid in the snow\nI want to relearn what I already know\nJust let me take flight, dressed in red\nThrough the night, on a great big sled\n\n[Post-Chorus: Brandon Flowers]\nI want to wish you Merry Christmas\nHo, ho, ho\n\n[Verse 3: Brandon Flowers]\nNow the boys are all grown up\nAnd they're working their fingers to the bone\nThey go around chasing them girls on the weekend\nYou know they still can't be alone\nAnd I've been racking my brain\nWith thoughts of peace and love\nHow on earth did we get so mixed up?\nI pray to God it don't last a long time\n\n[Chorus: Brandon Flowers]\nI want to roll around like a kid in the snow\nI want to relearn what I already know\nJust let me take flight, dressed in red\nThrough the night, on

the jungle where the choppers would rumble\nWith the smell of napalm in the air\nAnd the sergeant said \"Look up ahead\"\nLike a dark evil cloud, 1,200 came down on him and 29 more\nThey fought for their lives but most of them died in the 173rd Airborne\n[Chorus]\nOn the 8th of November the angels were cryin'\nAs they carried his brothers away\nWith the fire rainin' down and the hell all around\nThere were few men left standing that day\nSaw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky\n1965, the 8th of November\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow he's 58 and his pony tail's gray\nBut the battle still plays in his head\nHe limps when he walks but he's strong when he talks\nAbout the Shrapnel they left in his leg\nHe puts on a gray suit over his Airborne tattoo\nAnd he ties it on one time a year\nAnd remembers the fallen as he orders a tall one\nAnd swallows it down with his tears\n\n[Chorus]\nOn the 8th of November the angels were cryin'\nAs they carried his brothers away\nWith the fire rainin'

animal that invented lower-livin'?\nThe projects, thank God for Russell Simmons\nThank God for Sugarhill\nI'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill\nY'all know what it is, scared for your own kids\nHow these ghetto niggas taken over showbiz\n\n[Hook]\nThey give us guns and drugs\nThen wonder why in the fuck we thugs\nThey wanna count the slugs\nThen come around here and fuck with

in the hood\n\u2018Cause when niggas get tribal\nIt's all about survival, nobody liable\nI got caught by Five-O\nGrandmama came to court with her Bible\nBut when the judge hit the gavel\nNow I'm too far from my family to travel\nI just came unraveled\nSocked the D.A. before I got gaffled\nOwned by C.A, State Property\nJust like the year fifteen fifty three\nLooking for me, a one-way ticket

the wave\nIt came down crashing, it's time to start again\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBackwards to go forward\nLeft at every corner\nBeen there and back again\nAnd when the music ends\n[Chorus]\nYour life is a flashback\nA question, a photograph\nA statement, a story, a struggle\nA chance to laugh\n'Cause if you don't laugh you cry\nA last crescendo when you die\nSo hit the rewind and listen\nIt's the playback\nThe soundtrack to your life\n\n[Verse 2]\nFirst step, your last breath\nEverything's been planned\nThere's questions and answers\nYou'll never understand\nI hold on but let go\nGive you room to breathe\nRemember the best things\nWere never mine to keep\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nStarting at the ending\nYou won't break while you're bending\nBeen there and back again\nAnd when the music ends\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYour life is a flashback\nA question, a photograph\nA statement, a story, a struggle\nA chance to laugh\n'Cause if you don't laugh you cry\nA last crescendo when you die\nSo hit the rewind and listen\nIt's the playback\nThe soundtrack to your life\n\n[Bridge]\nSoundtrack to your life\nThat it goes by like a bullet\nAnd my name\nIt may be different than yours\nBut we are the same\nBeat up broken back for more\nI'll be dragging my own ass off the floor\nI've thrown myself right in it\nWhat's the point if you don't live it\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nIf you can hear me\nAnd know that I'm right here\nI heard your heartbeat\nIt took away the fear\n[Chorus]\nYour life is a flashback\nA question, a photograph\nA statement, a story, a struggle\nA chance to laugh\n'Cause if you

tried all that you can, turning you red\n[Chorus]\nChange my attempt, good intentions\nShould I? Could I?\nHere we are with your obsession\nShould I? Could I?\n\n[Verse 2]\nCrowned, hopeless, the article read, \"living wasteland\"\nThis time you've tried all that you can, turning you red\nBut I will not hide you through this, I want you to help\n\n[Chorus]\nChange my attempt, good intentions\nShould I?

"What We Do Lyrics[Intro: Freeway]\nMan if I get rocked, this shit for my kids nigga\nIt's that real shit (Even though what we do is wrong)\n\n[Verse 1: Freeway & Jay-Z]\nWe still hustle 'til the sun come up\nCrack a 40 when the sun go down\nIt's a cold winter, y'all niggas better bundle up\nAnd I bet it be a hotter summer, grab a onion just to rock it down\nYou hot now, listen up\nDon't you know cops' sole purpose is to lock us down?\nAnd throw away the key\nBut without this drug shit, your kids ain't got no way to eat, huh?\nWe still try to keep mom, smilin'\nCause when her teeth stop showin'\nAnd her stomach start growlin' then the heat start flowin'\nIf you from the hood, I know you feel me (Keep goin')\nIf a sneak start leaning and the heat stop workin'\nThen my heat start working, I'ma rob me a person\nCatch a nigga sleeping while he out in the open\nAnd I'ma get him (Keep flowin')\nWe gotta raise our kids while we livin'\nMake a million off a record, bail my niggas outta prison\nFuck a Bentley or a Lexus, just my boys in the squadder\nNigga talk reckless then I hit 'em with the Smith 'n\nBut I'm never snitching, I'm a rider\nIf my kids hungry, snatch the dishes out ya kitchen\nI'll be wilding 'til they pick me out a line-up\nEven though what we do is wrong\nWe keep the nines tucked, chopped dimes up, rap about it\nWild out, fuck niggas up, laugh about it\nI'm not tryna visit the morgue\nBut Freeway move out 'til I sit with the Lord\n'Til I, get my shit together, clean up my sins\nFreeway got it in like 10 in the morning\nAnd I can get it to ya like 10 while you yawning mang\nEven though what we do is wrong\nStill deliver the order mang\nAnd I ain't talking 'bout chicken and gravy mang\nI'm talking bout bricks of yayo, halves and quarters\nFou and a halves of hash, you do the math\nSwing past us, scoop up your daughter\nShe wanna roll with a thug that rap, you do the math\nHe gon' blast 'til my stacks in order mang!\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nMang, let me get 'em Free\nHov never slacking mang, zipping in the black Range\nFaster than the red ghost, getting ghost with Pac-Man\nOne-time know I got a knack to get that change\nLeader of the black gang, R-O-C mang\nBang like T-Mac, ski mask, air it out\nGotta kill witnesses 'cause Free's beard's sticking out\nY'all don't want to witness shit, we squeeze hammers mang\nBullets breeze by you, like Louisiana mang\nBut I gotta feed Tianna mang\nSo I move keys, you can call me the Piano Man\nRain, sleet, hail, snow man\nSlang dope, E, hydro man\n\n[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]\nYou, know, B. Sige' in the third lane\nGramps still praying, working on my nerves man\nLike, \"Son you gotta get your soul clean\nBefore they blow them horns like Coltrane\"\nBut still I cry tears of a hustler\nWipe tears from my mother, pour out beers for our brothers\nThat's above us, make beds for the babies\nTuck kids under covers, buy cribs for their mothers\nShit, I'll probably be wilding with their fathers\nTell Ms. Robert, tell Anajmah that I'm riding for her father\nThat's like my brother, like same mother, different father\nAny problems dawg, know I got 'em\nAnd still we grind from the bottom\nJust to make it to the bottom, sold crack in the alleyways\nStill gave back Marcy on Dollar Day\nReal gangstas make hood holidays\nThey ain't thank us but we still paid homage mang\nSoul Food Sunday looking like Big Momma's mang\nTell the gang I never break my promise mang\nMang, uhh!\nYou might also like[Outro]\nEven though what we do is wrong\nWrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong\nWrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong\nEven though what we do is wrong\nWrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong\nWrong, wrong, wrong, wrong12Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path":

on up)\nWe finally got a piece of the pie\n\n[Verse 1]\nWatch these grown men get it, know fo' sho'\nYo, get your back up off the wall and get your feet on the floor\nYou see the boy at the bar wit the glass so tall\nWhen I'm done baby dogg I'ma show you Baltimore\nRight now we gon' party, Bacardi give me some more\nIt's off the rack the club packed, I'm two-cut like two doors\nOf course I do my two-step, I give 'em too much\nI mustered up bad, I drop ashes in my cup\nI had enough they throwin' bows, see they swingin and shit\nI got my arm around this smut dame, puttin' in work\nBefore we merk I got to book somethin'\nSo baby stop frontin'\nI got the drink and the smoke\nAin't got to buy nothin'\nNot bluffin, it's goin' down understand me\nI like my birds nasty, I burst in them cashmeres\nEverything, and you know what I came for\nRight now it's goin' down, let me on the dance floor\n[Hook - repeat 2X]\nWhoa now, that's what the old heads say\nI party like it's my birthday, drinkin and still thirsty\nWhoa now, shorty give me what you got\nThe spot kinda live and I see you gettin hot\n\n[Verse 2]\nI came to shake a load off, so take your coat off\nMixed drinks what you think, OJ and Smirnoff\nI sip it all - hey, what can I say\nSee I just got paid so I'm feelin' the swig and I'm tryin' get laid\nI'm buyin' drinks and they love it\nDivas growin' cheaper\nGucci bag Gucci bucket\nTakin' shots from my cousin\nHe don' know how to act\nCame straight out the woods\nAnd the club wit a sack\nLike what you know no good\nBut I know I pimp nasty\nSneakers is off the meter\nYou can't help wit the clap\nCan't help but the boogie\nGet loose but don't push me\nWe came so deep\nAnd we're all wearin' hoodies\nAll my eighty-dime soldiers\nWhat you doin' tonight\nNow, put yo eight-dimes up\nYou made enough for the night\nLet's take a break\nLet's spend some cake\nYou ain't enjoyin' your life\nYo, we been workin' all week\nSo we gon' do it tonight\nCome on\nYou

run\nShe's gonna get a little huh huh\nLook at her now\nShe wants to take the wheel\nShe says, 'you dirty dog'\nYou want to rock the bop and take it home'\n\n[Pre- Chorus]\nWhy oh why am i gonna play\nSo many times it goes this way\nMy heart gets blown away\nThese eyes are blown away\n[Chorus]\nDo you remember how were were\nDo you remember summer days\nSometimes i feel like going down down\nWalk like a loaded man (down down)\nGet the bump to the bump de bump de bump soul (down down)\nMove like a thing, swing line a thong\nAnd do your jiggy mama til the break of dawn\nLoad the rocket, shock it and rock it til you drop\nDo the bump to the bump and don't stop\n\nLoaded up from dusk til dawn\nI wonder how she feels\nDancing around with my love\nWhile i'm sitting waiting for the huh huh\nFired up that smoke screen\nRed lipstick and high heels\nLook at her now\nShe wants to rock the bop and take it home\n\n[Pre- Chorus]\nWhy oh why am i gonna play\nSo many times it goes this way\nMy heart gets blown away\nThese eyes are born again\nSee Ricky Martin LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like[Chorus][x2]\n\n[Outro]\nWalk like a loaded man (talk like a gazombadam)\nGet the bump to the bump de bump de bump soul\n(slip into the funk like a sweet cologne)\nMove like a thing, swing line a thong\nAnd do your jiggy mama til the break of dawn\nLoad the

What did he say?)\n(How 'bout some one-on-one, you wanna play?)\nI told him why not, I got some time\nBut when I beat you real bad, try not to cry\n(Please Aaron, are you for real?\nOne-on-one with Shaquille O'Neal?)\nYeah, 34 center from the L.A. Lakers\n(You must've been nervous) I knew I could take him\nStared at Shaq, psyche him out\nI said O'Neal, you're in my house now\nStart the game the whistle blows\nPay attention close 'cause the story goes\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's like boom (boom)\nI put it in the hoop\nLike slam (slam)\nI heard the crowd screaming\nOut jam (jam)\nI swear that I'm telling you the facts\n'Cause that's how I beat Shaq\nIt's like boom (boom)\nI put it in the hoop\nLike slam (slam)\nI heard the crowd screaming\nOut jam (jam)\nI swear that I'm telling you the facts\n'Cause that's how I beat Shaq\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nSo check it out, I thought I had the lead\nBut then he started scoring mad points on me\nI was scorin' the bricks (was he hitting all the shots?)\nI knew that there was a way that I could make it stop\nI had a plan, I could change the pace\nI said, \"Yo Shaq you didn't tie your shoelace\"\nHe looked down, I stole the ball\nI'm taking him to school now, watch me all\nA 3-pointer, nothing but net\nCome on Shaq, had enough yet?\nDown by two, I'm catching up\nI guess you're getting nervous 'cause you already lost\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's like boom (boom)\nI put it in the hoop\nLike slam (slam)\nI heard the crowd screaming\nOut jam (jam)\nI swear that I'm telling you the facts\n'Cause that's how I beat Shaq\nIt's like boom (boom)\nI put it in the hoop\nLike slam (slam)\nI heard the crowd screaming\nOut jam (jam)\nI swear that I'm telling you the facts\n'Cause that's how I beat Shaq\n'Cause that's how I beat Shaq\n[Bridge]\nDunk after dunk, jam after jam\nCheerleaders are cheering (Aaron's the man)\nDunk after dunk, jam after jam\nCheerleaders are cheering (Aaron's the man)\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnnouncers were shocked, couldn't believe it was real\n(I can't believe a kid just stuffed O'Neal)\nOne more second, was all that remained\nI put the ball up, I put him in shame\nI must admit that it sounds real crazy\nBut the ball went in, then he cried like a baby\nSorry Shaq, I should've let you win\nYou're good too and we can still be friends\nThe fans went nuts, they put me on their shoulders\nThen I heard a voice and it sounded like my mother's\n(Get up for school, you're gonna be late)\nMa, can't you see that I'm playing a game?\n(How you could be playing if you're still in bed?)\n(Are you gettin' sick, did you hit your head?)\nAw, man it was all a dream\nI guess that kinda thing could never happen to me\nIf it was a dream and it wasn't real\nHow'd I get a jersey with the name O'Neal?

gift or two\nNot really in the Christmas mood\nStanding right in front of me\nWas a little boy waiting anxiously\nPacing 'round like little boys do\nAnd in his hands he held a pair of shoes\nAnd his clothes were worn and old\nHe was dirty from head to toe\nAnd when it came his time to pay\nI couldn't believe what I heard him say\n[Chorus]\nSir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please\nIt's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size\nCould you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time\nYou see, she's been sick for quite awhile\nAnd I know these shoes would make her smile\nAnd I want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe counted pennies for what seemed like years\nThen the Cashier said, \"Son, there's not enough here\"\nHe searched his pockets frantically\nThen he turned and he looked at me\nHe said, \"Mama made Christmas good at our house\nThough most years she just did without\"\n\"Tell me, sir, what am I going to do\nSomehow I've got to buy her these Christmas shoes\"\nSo I laid the money down, I just had to help him out\nAnd I'll never forget the look on his face when he said\n\"Mama's gonna look so great\"\n\n[Chorus]\nSir, I want to buy these shoes for my Mama, please\nIt's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size\nCould you hurry, sir, Daddy says there's not much time\nYou see, she's been sick for quite awhile\nAnd I

"Imagine That Lyrics[Intro: LL Cool J]\nI just want you to fantasize with imagination\nKnow what I'm saying, uh yeah, yeah\nUh, yeah I like that\nGive me some more, some more of my vocals\nYou know sex 'em up a little bit\nYou know what I mean?\n\n[Verse 1: LL Cool J]\nYou're the honey that I see when I'm riding by\nThe one giving me a feeling that I can't deny\nYou got the Prada boots on suede hitting your thigh\nActing like my chrome twenties ain't catching your eye\nSometimes I slow down catch the ass in the mirror\nTurn the fog lights on to see the legs more clearer\nYou're turning me on, keep me standing up\nI wish that I could prove to you that I'm man enough\nI come up to your job and handcuff your boss\nThrow that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off\nThen sit you up on the copy machine\nMake copies of your kitten with my chin in between\nThen I'll take you to the window so the world can see\nBaby I'm down on my knees let your world be free\nPearl tongue, come get up on this desk with me\nMultiple orgasms is your destiny\nWet dream, ride like you're going to Queens\nLike I just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned 18\nTo hell with your boss\nLet that nigga hear you scream\nSounding like that screech on the fax machine\nThen we can take it to the ladies bathroom\nMake your mascara run till you look like a racoon\nTouch yourself baby tell me it's wet\nSqueeze tight so I'll never forget, here we go\n[Chorus: LeShaun (LL Cool J)]\nI'ma get you for your paper\nMake you leave you girl\n(Imagine that)\nMake you trick on me around the world\n(Imagine that)\nHave you calling me your ultimate thrill\n(Imagine that)\nI got you whipped tell your niggas to chill\nI'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide\n(Imagine that)\nMe and my fold got my broads collide\n(Imagine that)\nKnocking girls off two at a time\n(Imagine that)\nDisrespect you and still make you mine (Uh-uh)\n\n[Verse 2: LL Cool J]\nUh, imagine I'm your teacher and you stayed after school\nYou've been a bad girl you broke all the rules\nForgot your homework, chewed gum in class\nAnd the only way to fix it is to give me some ass\nI got a three piece suit on sitting at my desk\nI kinda need a shave but my body smell fresh\nYou're wearing a plad skirt and long white socks\nThe vibe is thick baby, we both red hot\nI kiss your neck unbutton your blouse\nLet my fingers make circles on the edge of your mouth\nYour apple's so ripe I'm your tutor for life\nGot your beggin' me to put you on detention tonight\nYou could read the Iliad and the whole Odyssey\nBut no Trojan soldier scold you like me\nMatch the calculus then measure my frequency\nBut when you blast on my lap that's the highest degree\nPut your hands on the chalkboard scratch it with ya nails\nGive me goose pimples when ya put yo tounge on my dimples\nBaby feel me now you got yo ass suspended\nGot a letter for your parents but I didn't wanna send it\nI stopped by the crib you invited me in\nYou convinced me somehow to sip some juice and gin\nThen you take me to your parent's room and laid me on my back\nYou twisting, kissing ya fist like that\nRubber meets the road till the tire goes flat\nI filled it up with air again baby hold that\nYou a bad girl look you got your sheets all wet\nSqueeze tight so i never forget the teacher's pet\nYou might also like[Chorus: LeShaun (LL Cool J)]\nI'ma get you for your paper\nMake you leave you girl\n(Imagine that)\nMake you trick on me around the world\n(Imagine that)\nHave you calling me your ultimate thrill\n(Imagine that)\nI got you whipped tell your niggas to chill\nI'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide\n(Imagine that)\nMe and my fold got my broads collide\n(Imagine that)\nKnocking girls off two at a time\n(Imagine that)\nDisrespect you and still make you mine (Uh-uh)\n\n[Verse 3: LL Cool J]\nYou was laughing with your girlfriends, sipping a drink\nWhen I came up from behind you and wrapped you with my mink\nGuided you to the dance floor and held you tight\nWe in the Tunnel in the back with the dim red lights\nI'm rocking the tank top baby nothing but ice\nYou rocking the baby tee and mini skirts and spikes\nThe club is so black we can't see our own hands\nI know you feel that bulge through them Fubu pants\nYou bold huh, wanna feel it in your hands\nRub your ass all up on it cause you know that I want it\nGod gave you beauty and you love to flaunt it\nLife is a song, you were born to perform it\nDrink the Cristal at the same time\nGet intoxicated till we lose are minds\nThe crowd seperated as we start to shine\nI lift you in the air your skirt starts to climb\nWe tongue kiss deep in front of the whole crowd\nThe lights start to flash the music is too loud\nWe hit the back door and jump in the limousine\nYou pull up your skirt I put some ice in between\nYou're tired from the dancing so I kiss your feet\nEven though we outside I hear the bass from the beat\nFunkmaster Flex chop it up for the freaks\nDJ Enuff make the mommies wanna creep\nNo problem uh mi spouse no aqui\nTu muy caliente tu vamos con mi\nSi mami I'm the chaffer make it whip\nTake a ride bet you never forget, here we go\n[Chorus: LeShaun (LL Cool J)]\nI'ma get you for your paper\nMake you leave you girl\n(Imagine that)\nMake you trick on me around the world\n(Imagine that)\nHave you calling me your ultimate thrill\n(Imagine that)\nI got you whipped tell your niggas to chill\nI'ma hit you in the backseat and tell you to slide\n(Imagine that)\nMe and my fold got my broads collide\n(Imagine that)\nKnocking girls off two at a time\n(Imagine that)\nDisrespect you and still make you mine (Uh-uh)Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/1789225", "artist_names":

step to me, and win?\nNo I didn't think so, I ran out of ink so\nA pencil will make it so funky it stinks\nSo dope, I'll get a crackhead high\nAnd then again, he'll OD and die\nSo may I, say I, been labeled as a bully\nAm I semi, no because I'm fully\nAutomatically loaded, dramatically exploded\nExploit it, avoid it, why, because I wrote it\nThe mic is like a weapon when I'm steppin through\nI'm getting wreck like a demolition crew\nAnd I'll bet, your girlfriend sweats, I know who\nBut I'm a threat, there ain't a damn thing you can do\nWhen I press up, cause I fess up\nMess up and fuck up\nFlash a little too much cash and you getting stuck up\nDiss the X, you won't get far\nDo it, and I'ma smack you like the bitch you are\nBecause you're a sucker butt, PooPutt\nThere's nothing you could do but shut up\nCause I'm fed up with you but, I'ma let you slide\nCause I'm in a nice mood\nBut on the other hand, I don't mind being rude\nExtremely quick to flip, or take no junk\nBetter than Dominique on the reverse slam dunk\nFive foot eleven which is not that tall\nBut I can handle a rapper just like a basketball\nSo before you fill your oats and start thinkin you're fly\nYou better act like Sybil and \"Walk on By\"\nYou might also like(Chorus)\n\"Unstoppable force\nDMX, an unstoppable force\" 8x\n\n[DMX]\nAn unstoppable force, not to be reckoned with\nClear my throat, get to one two checkin with\nA mic, I'll beat up, slow down and speed up\nMixed the batter, serve you on a platter and eat up\nI know you wanna do me, you would if you could\nBut you can't, so when I'm hungry, you're finger lickin' good\nBetter than a three course, you feel the remorse\nOf the U-N S-T-O-P-P-A-B-L-E force\n\n(Chorus)\n\"Unstoppable force\nDMX, an unstoppable force\" 8xEmbed"}, {"_type":

on\nNothing's fine, I'm torn\n[Chorus]\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\nI'm cold and I am shamed\nLying naked on the floor\nIllusion never changed\nInto something real\nI'm wide awake and I can see\nThe perfect sky is torn\nYou're a little late\nI'm already torn\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo I guess the fortune teller's right\nShould've seen just what was there\nAnd not some holy light\nBut you crawled beneath my veins, and now\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't care, I had no luck\nI don't miss it all that much\nThere's just so many things\nThat I can't touch, I'm torn\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\nI'm cold and I am shamed\nLying naked on the floor\nIllusion never changed\nInto something real\nI'm wide awake and I can see\nThe perfect sky is torn\nYou're a little late, I'm already torn\nTorn\n(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nThere's nothing where he used to lie\nMy inspiration has run dry\nThat's what's going on\nNothing's right, I'm torn\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\nI'm cold and I am shamed\nLying naked on the floor\nIllusion never changed\nInto something real\nI'm wide awake and I can see\nThe perfect sky is torn\n\n[Outro]\nI'm all out of faith\nThis is how I feel\nI'm cold and I'm ashamed\nBound and broken on the floor\nYou're a little late, I'm already torn\nTorn\nOh\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n(Ooh yeah, a little)\n(Ooh yeah, a little)\n(Ooh yeah, a little)24Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/328752", "artist_names": "Backstreet Boys", "full_title": "I'll Never Break
