my brothers like they me\nHad to make myself a boss, it ain't no nigga workin' me\nI invest a couple mil' and let my money work for me\nKnow they hate the way it happened, probably somewhere cursin' me\nI don\u2019t know nothing \u2019bout no killin', all I know is murder beats\nI got rich and understand my next three cars gon\u2019 be a lease\nI ain't never losin' sleep about no beef, I roll in peace\nI put diamonds in my teeth, came from grindin' in the streets\nGet a load and break it down and sell it all and then repeat it\nPray to God for all the dawgs behind the wall, they need they freedom (Free y\u2019all)\nWhen I be on TV and perform, I hope they see me (See me)\nOnce it's up, it's stuck, we get over on niggas, not get even\nForgiato rims on my dually, I ride diesel\nOnly rock Amiris with my team, not no Diesel\nGot some niggas up in Philly play with birds like they Eagles\nShe keep sayin' I'm the man, that shit boostin' up my ego\nStill in Atlanta sellin' bags like they legal, I'm just sayin' (Yeah)\n[Chorus]\nHow you try to run off with the wave and you ain't surfin'?\nGave 'em all the drip, them niggas still acted thirsty\nI ain't even counted up to see what I'm

(Oh), everybody starin' (Lookin')\nLil' one from the hood turned into the man (Big dawg)\nGet a lot of money (Yeah), try to stuff it in my pants (4 Pockets)\nI might do the woah (Woah), nigga, I don't dance\nRings on my hand cost a fortune\nShout out to my mama, no abortion (What's up?)\nD-Boy, white Air Forces (Crisp)\nDifferent kinda bags, I got choices (Flavors)\nAnd I got the swag for a loyal

the baddest, guess I gotta wait to pick 'em\nTry us, then we smashin', then they go to playin' victim (Kill 'em)\nI don't know what happened, all I know is he got hit up\nI'ma need a napkin, chains drippin', VV's lit up\nI'ma get the money and go hard long as I get up (Get up)\nWe gon' beat the trial, I told lil' bruh to do some sit-ups (Push-up)\nWin, win, win, no lose or draw, I never give up

about no charge\nI just stack my money different, every ten go in a rubber band\nToo much attention on these rappers, fuck it, we gon' whack their man\nSome shit I don't understand, I go get it, I never ask\nI don't condone that robbin', but if you slime, suggest you wear a mask\nTreat my niggas and my bitches all like players, buy 'em all bags\nWish I would've answered for the homies that I

just lost his dawg into the system, it got me fucked up\nI can't tell him nothin' negative, so I told him he gon' luck up\nHad a bittersweet birthday, got a bad call in a Rolls truck (What?)\nRed guts look watermelon and spaghetti and some ketchup (Hey)\nAll my niggas leavin' me, this shit got me depressed (Woah)\nThought he was gon' wreck the Maserati or the 'Vette\nBut he on the yard with the old dawgs, they at rec (Huh)\nI missed a court call, what they said?\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Lil Baby]\nNo more fake text messages, leave 'em all on read (Yeah)\nAnd this game some bullshit, but they payin' so I play it (I play it)\nCartier earrings, act like I don't hear what they be sayin' (Yeah)\nKeep that shit too solid, I spent millions on my family (Woo)\nNone of that shit promised, I pay cash, I take chances (Woo)\nI don't understand nothin', I don't want no advance\nBlood on these diamonds, they look good, they dance\nBig truck pull up like a blue ambulance\n\n[Chorus: Young Thug

I\u2005can't\u2005explain\nYeah\n\n[Verse 1]\nClothes busted, nose\u2005dusty, watch the older bros hustlin'\nStarted\u2005off wrong, but you couldn't tell me I ain't know nothin'\nAll I ever want was to put on and give my folks somethin'\nKnockin' on my sister window, comin' in at 4 somethin'\nMama trippin' 'bout the way I'm livin' and how my hoes comin' (In and out)\nCaught the next-door neighbor slippin', we slimed him, left his nose runnin' (In his house)\nKnowin' I can't lie, so when she asked me, I  make no comment\nTerrorizin', thuggin', doin' dumb shit, makin' no money\nIt was time for me to go up, got a pack and made it blow up\nWent into that corner store until I got it all\nKnow I skipped a couple parts, but I can't never tell 'em all\nBut the moral of the story, I got it all out the mud\nThe way karma make me feel, I swear I think I'm in love\nBeen fuckin' strippers since I was lil', fell in love with the club\nBruh gave me everything I need, knew what to say to the plug\nI got my hands on a few mil', but shit, it still ain't enough\nIt's like my life is like a dream, but I'm still here when I wake\nI'm gon' get everything I need, I'll do whatever it take\nI caught a

Lyrics[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Meek Mill]\nYou know I still believe, still believe in you and me\n'Cause every night I go\u2005to\u2005sleep, go to\u2005sleep\nI can see it like a\u2005movie in my dreams\nPut my face in the dirt on the ground\nStill, I raise up to take back the crown, yes\nYou can break my body\nBut you can't lock the soul of a man down (Yeah, uh)\n\n[Verse 1: Meek Mill]\nFollow your dreams, not your addictions\nHow we gon' follow our dreams locked in a prison?\nThey tried to swallow me whole, God be my witness\nDeprive me out of my dreams but I'm relentless\nI want the money, ain't never want attention\nSo I don't pay attention to comments and all the mentions\n'Cause they ain't see my vision\nI was washin' dishes 'til my rags turned into riches\nGlad when it was Christmas\nWe ain't even barely get presents, but we was gifted\nIn the school of failure, we present, perfect attendance\nWelfare baby, we workin' with what they give us\nMade me some commas, judge still gave me a sentence\nNo period, city girls don't get scared when it's really real\nWhen your bank account twenty mil' and your house up on a hill\nAnd your fam in the driveway, you walk out and see the grill\nThank God you believe, make sure you pray when you kneel, yeah\n[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Meek Mill]\nYou know I still believe, still believe in you and me\n'Cause every night I go to sleep, go to sleep\nI can see it like a movie in my dreams\nPut my face in the dirt on the ground\nStill, I raise up to take back the crown, yes\nYou can break my body\nBut you can't lock the soul of a man down (Yeah, uh)\n\n[Verse 2: Meek Mill]\nMy bank account, it was on super-zero\nAin't never panic, I'm a superhero (Uh)\nTarget my goals and I'ma shoot the arrow\nWhen God turned the heat up on me, he said \"You De Niro\"\nPlay your part, got some brains like the scarecrow\nLet's play it smart, 'cause we ain't playin' checkers, this is chess, play your pawns\nSit back like a king, when they move, make your mark\nAnd never ever let your competition take your heart (Take your heart)\nSay I believe in myself\nWhen everybody stop believin', never leave on yourself\nThey had my back against the wall, I had to lean on myself\nAlmost made me put my dreams on the shelf, I'm trippin' (I'm trippin')\nLaws of attraction, you just think I'm rappin'\nI'm just puttin' out the energy so I can grab it\nEverything that's in my memory that I imagined\nIt's finally here, hundred million in a year\nYou might also like[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]\nI still believe, still believe in you and me\n'Cause every night I go to sleep, go to sleep\nI can see it like a movie in my dreams\nPut my face in the dirt on the ground\nStill, I raise up to take back the crown, yes\nYou can break my body\nBut you can't lock the soul of a man down\n\n[Outro: Justin Timberlake, Meek Mill, Justin Timberlake & Meek Mill]\nAs I lay (As I lay) me down to sleep (Down to sleep)\nPray the Lord (Pray) my soul to keep (Soul to keep)\nFallen ones, (Fallen ones) rest in peace (R.I.P.)\nPlease, God, watch over me (Watch over me)\nAs I lay (As I lay) me down to sleep (Down to sleep)\nPray the Lord (Pray)

plumber\nY'all lil' niggas is some foot soldiers, I'm a foot fungus\nYou dead, brother\nI ain't a killer, but don't push me, like a red button\nThe gun headbutt you like \"Bang, bang, bang, bang\"\n'Til your heart stop drummin'\nI shoot you while the sun don't shine, this a hot summer\nBut fall dawg, I knock a wall off with this sawed-off\nThis bitch sound like a hard cough\nI'm a wizard with this mothafucka like I went to Hogwarts\nCut the hog head and the tail off\nI'm the nigga bitches put a spell on\nAnd once it wear off, then, bitch, don't touch me like a airball\nSay slime, I done ate slime, money tall like 8'9\"\nBut I'm still starvin' like a skinny model in LA slime, that plate mine\nHooded up like Trayvon, no FaceTime\nI don't FaceTime with my new thang\nNew Tang clan, like Raekwon, I'm stupid, nigga\nDumb, deaf, brazy, cray-cray, blind\nBut I still see in the dark, nigga\nDark nigga, Akon\nI'm on my shit like maggots\nAnd they then they grow and they fly\nGot real bitches with fake asses\nWith real views and fake eyes\nIt's stupid, I'm stupid\nI'm out of my Kufi, narcotic abuser\nNo needles, 'cause my pockets balloonin'\nYour partners is poodles\nYour bears is cubs, your crocodile's toothless\nTitty-fuck your baby mama\nShe breastfeed your child while I do it, I'm stupid\n[Bridge]\nYour crocodile's toothless\nTitty-fuck your baby mama\nShe breastfeed your

these fuckin' vaginas I'm douchin'\nDroppin' these jewels, it's precious like I'm droppin' my jewelry\nI'm out of my Gucci, you not on my Gucci, that's not an exclusive\nDesigners, excuse me, massagers masseuse me\nOops, I mean masseuses massage me, I'm gruesome, I'm grimey\nTurn you and lil' mami, to tuna salami\nYou pukin', she vomit, that's beautiful science\nThat's Tune in a Masi', that's who in a Hyundai\nYou stupid or drowsy? I pew in the 'Gatti\nPew, pew and I got 'em, pew, pew and I got 'em\nLil' Tunechi a shotta\nCome through with my shottas, catch you and your thotta\nTurn a nigga noodle to nada\nFind it amusin', it's like it's a movie\nThis life is a movie, you died in the movie, I write and produce it\nI cried as I view it, I'm lyin', I'm goofin', I'm tyin' my nooses\nLightin' my fluids, ignitin' influence, wait\nRetire like Ewings, I'm high like I flew in\nAnd my wife lookin' Jewish, wait\nMy money look Arabic, blunt lookin' Cuban\nMy eyes look Korean, the coke look Peruvian, wait\nShe European and she from Aruba, she from the States\nAss overseas, pussy foreign food, we overate\nWe throw them B's up high as the moon, suwu in space\nI come from Mars, but I act like I'm from the Planet of the Apes\nMansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way\nDon't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day\nGot a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face\nAnd I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face\nI cannonballed her face\nFuck her to some Diana Ross and faint\nDamn, I lost the faith\nDon't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case\nYou can't avoid the Drac'\nDrip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today\nBig rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate\nYour pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way\nNow pass the phone to bae\nI'm bringin' a pole, you dancin' on his grave\nHe faker than the lashes on his babe, I'm like lashes on a slave\nI'm ashin' on his head\nHe ain't got no

thousand violins\nSouls floating away like feathers in the wind\n[Verse: Eminem]\nThey said my last album I sounded bitter\nNo, I sound like a spitter\nWho ninety percent of\nThese hypocrites are tryna get rid of\nBut why would I get a chip on my shoulder?\nI was considered, one time, as the illest\nBitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper\nTrue, I just get richer\nBut if it was ever all about skrilla\nThen I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago\nBitch, shut the fuck up\nI should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or to Jigga\nNobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit\nNo wonder you're mad, now I'm\nLooking at them plaques, count 'em (Yeah)\nI'm LL Cool J, Bigger and Deffer, that's how come (Uh)\nI sell like four mil' when I put out a bad album (What?)\nRevival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em\nBut Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta\nFive, and I'll laugh out loud\n'Cause that's what they gave BAD back in the day\nWhich actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause\nIf it happened to James\nIt can happen to Shady\nThey do the same shit to Brady\nMore people hate me than love me\nThis game will make you go crazy\n'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E\nI was the G, the O-A-T\nOnce I was played in rotation\nAt every radio station\nThey said I'm lyrically amazing\nBut I have nothing to say\nBut then when I put out Revival and I had something to say\nThey said that they hated the awake me\nI lose the rage, I'm too tame\nI get it back, they say I'm too angry\nI need to get me some Dre beats\nNo, I should hook up with Tay Keith\nFans keep on pulling me one way\nHaters pull me in another\nGot more hooks in me than Swae Lee\n'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches\nThey said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby\nI dish it out but can't take it\nBut I take it, dish it back out\nAnd they get all bent out of shape\nThis shit's almost comical\nWait, and I meant no disrespect\nI wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z\nThey probably feel the same way because lately\nInstead of us being credited for longevity\nAnd being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we\nGet told we'll never be what we were\nBitch, if I was as half as good as I was\nI'm still twice as good as you'll ever be\nOnly way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically\n'Cause if you diss me I'm coming after you like the letter V\nKilling everything, play this tune, it's your eulogy\nIt's your funeral, prepare to die\nThis is music for you to be

hate\nMy,\u2005my\u2005stepdad\n\n[Verse 1]\nOne thing that\u2005sticks in my craw\nWhen I was\u2005six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my Ma\nSocked her right in her eyeball\nI'm startin' to think I'm psychotic\nWith all the pictures I draw of\nShit that I've already witnessed, it\u2019s probably twisted my thoughts\nAll I can hear is drama with Mom and him\nI can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways\nThe walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm\nOur dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard\nDoctors had to put it down\nHe killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!\n[Chorus]\nI, I, hate\nMy, my stepdad (Stepdad)\nSo tonight I'm sayin', \"Bye-bye stepdad\" (Stepdad)\n\n[Verse 2]\nOutside, I look like I'm calm\nInside, I'm a tickin' time bomb\n'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom (My mom)\nLast night, he said I left the kitchen light on\nBut he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him\nHickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times\nHe swatted me with it, I'd cry\nHe just started hittin' me harder\nGod, I wish I could just jaw him\nIf I could get my weight up\nBut I'm just a second grader\nThis prick is bigger than I am\nBut I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide\nI'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time\nSneak up with a lethal injection\nAnd put him down like they did to my dog\nI'm talkin' euthanasia (Euthanasia), like kids in Taiwan\nThis fuckin' shit's like Saigon (Saigon)\nNeighbors called police on him\nSo many battery charges, this dude's like lithium-ion\nThen Mom and him let bygones (Bygones)\nJust be bygones\nSo on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off\nBut this is why I...\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI, I, hate\nMy, my stepdad (Stepdad)\nSo tonight I'm sayin', \"Bye-bye stepdad\" (Stepdad)\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo this year, I'm goin' into the fifth and I'm tall\nI'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got\nWay bigger fish to fry\nWhich is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off\nThe handle and wait for the fist to fly to put this guy in a pine box\nHe's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan\nSo this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons\nI'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'\nHe walks by, kicks my arm and goes, \"Oops\" and just laughs\nI yelled for Mom (Mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense\nI stood up and said, \"Fuck you, punk\" and I took off and ran\nTo my bedroom, as I fled\nKnowin' shit would hit the fan\nSlammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat\nHe kicked it in\nI swung it hard as I could at his head\nHis noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed\nI'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear\nI threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass\nBeat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad\n\"Ding-dong,\" the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his\nStomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two-liter with\nThen buried him next to my dog\nAnd if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em\n[Chorus]\nI, I, hate\nMy, my stepdad (Stepdad)\nSo tonight I'm sayin', \"Bye-bye stepdad\" (Stepdad)\n'Cause I, I, hate\nMy, my stepdad (Stepdad)\nSo tonight I'm sayin', \"Bye-bye stepdad\"

start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)\nMy father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)\nSo, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)\nBut maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)\nThe neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)\nSay, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)\nI wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)\nTo break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)\nI ought to say, \"No, no, no, sir\" (Mind if I move in closer?)\nAt least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)\n[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]\nI really can't stay\n(Oh, baby, don't hold out)\nBaby, it's cold outside\n\n[Verse 2: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]\nI simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)\nThe answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)\nYour welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)\nSo nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)\nMy sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)\nMy brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)\nMy maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)\nBut maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)\nI've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)\nSay, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)\nYou've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)\nBut don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)\nThere's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)\nAt least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)\n\n[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]\nI really can't stay\n(Get over that cold out)\nBaby, it's cold\nBaby, it's cold outsideYou might also like5Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 12, "api_path": "/songs/5037838", "artist_names": "Harry Styles", "full_title": "Falling by\u00a0Harry\u00a0Styles", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/7eaae87a75effd425aa57446afa8da9c.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/7eaae87a75effd425aa57446afa8da9c.870x870x1.png", "id": 5037838, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 3499957, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1668483074, "path": "/Harry-styles-falling-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 133, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Harry-styles-falling-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2019, "month": 12, "day": 13}, "release_date_for_display": "December 13, 2019", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Dec. 13, 2019", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/ee79ab59275d25a69a5430f3db9c26f8.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ee79ab59275d25a69a5430f3db9c26f8.600x600x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 5, "hot": false, "pageviews": 1823236}, "title": "Falling", "title_with_featured": "Falling", "updated_by_human_at": 1668483074, "url": "https://genius.com/Harry-styles-falling-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/22457", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/413e6976af859481e40e7657eac9df45.1000x563x1.png", "id": 22457, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2891eded074c12bfba2ee9077f29fd57.400x400x1.jpg", "index_character": "h", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Harry Styles", "slug": "Harry-styles", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Harry-styles"}, "artist": "Harry Styles", "lyrics": "TranslationsT\u00fcrk\u00e7eEspa\u00f1olPortugu\u00easPolskiFran\u00e7aisFalling Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI'm in my bed\nAnd you're not here\nAnd there's no one to blame but the drink\u2005in\u2005my wandering hands\nForget\u2005what I said\nIt's not what I\u2005meant\nAnd I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat am I now?

the block selling raw\nShe said, she never would leave\nSoon as she left it was hard\nI wanted her here with me\nShe left me out with my boys\nBut I say, \"That\u2019s okay\"\nProtect my heart with

however you want it\nAim straight for the head, ah\nAnd she know that I love her, she want me to cuff her\nI think she\u2019ll hurt me, I never would let her\nI'm sending condolences inside of a letter\nStill trappin' like Griselda\nNo, it ain't safe in these streets, all alone, ah\nNo, we don't play, keep that heat, we take his soul, ah\nEven though when I\u2019m wrong, I ain't never gon' lie\nIf I feel that I owe you, I'm gon' make it right\nI'll be thuggin' and keepin' my head to the sky\nDouble back on a lap by myself and I cry\nIn the bed while I'm dreaming behind you I die\nBefore that can happen, I let off that fire\nTrappin' and rappin', we shoot to the top\nAfter I'm asking \"Can we have a child?\"\nAfter heartbreak, I\u2019ll cut off relations\nBut I be thinkin' 'bout you

sparkling lights\nBundled up in their mittens and coats\nAnd the cider would flow\nAnd I just wanna be there tonight\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSweet dreams of holly and ribbon\nMistakes are forgiven\nAnd everythin' is icy and blue\nAnd you would be there too\n\n[Chorus]\nUnder the mistletoe\nWatchin' the fire glow\nAnd tellin' me, \"I love you\"\nJust bein' in your arms\nTakes me back to that little farm\nWhere every wish comes true\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn my heart is a Christmas tree farm\nThere's a light in the barn\nWe run inside out from the cold\nIn the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs\nAnd they're warm and they're safe\nThey wake to see a blanket of snow\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSweet dreams of holly and ribbon\nMistakes are forgiven\nAnd everythin' is icy and blue\nAnd you would be there

can't seem to keep her knees closed\nI don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino\nI just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino\nDeep throat, know I get it in like a free throw\nShawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed\n[Verse]\nI fuck her long, ain't no Minute Maid, my diamonds lemonade\nFlexin' hard, call me Popeye, wallet filled with spinach, ayy\nCut you off on the interstate, I'm first to finish, ayy\nI'm a young, rich nigga, bitch, it's always been that way\nTo the grave, might just be tomorrow, might just be today\nSo I always live it up, we poppin' bottles, poppin' K's\nGucci shades from my bougie bitch, I ain't even had to pay\nHad to put on for the team and had to put on for the Bay\nI'm still fly when I wear Robin's wings, I can't stay in one place\nRussian Creams in my rocket ship, we go to outer space\nMask off, mask on, fuck it, I can't catch a case\nBlast off, blast off, see the stars up in the Wraith\nYou can't get into the crib because the mansion got a gate\nYou can't come into my section, I'm gon' put you into place\nIf your club goin' up, you bet I'm sliding like it's chess\nAnd I think I fell in love, she shook that ass up in my face\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino\nI just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino\nDeep throat, know I get it in like a free throw\nShawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed\nI don't want a valentine, I just want Valentino\nI just want the neck, I poke her face like a casino\nDeep throat, know I get it in like a free throw\nShawty want some mo', she just can't seem to keep her knees closed\nYou might also like[Post-Chorus]\nShe just can't seem to keep her knees closed\nShe just can't seem to keep her knees

it off, huh\nFuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes\nWhile serpents shake some brand new scales\nI need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos\nActing familiar, took all the rock\nAnd turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis\nAnd he ungrateful, they don't say thank you\nThey don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions\nFuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal\nRichard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds\nLook at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers\nForty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet\nThat cost a whop, that cost a whopper\nAnd it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker\nPretty still, it ain't no pretty pill\nIt's either real or real\nReal easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field\nSkin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel\nHands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel\nRocket\n[Bridge]\nQuit being violent with me (Yeah, why, why)\nQuit being violent with me\nQuit being violent with me\nYou make me violent\n\n[Outro]\nMy room, my room, my room with me\nEvery night you were in my room\nMy room, my room with me\nI guess I can't state my feelings too soon\nI don't know you\nAnd I can't put no
