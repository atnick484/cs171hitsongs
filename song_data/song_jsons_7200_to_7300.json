still live on and on, and on\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut how do you thank someone\nWho has taken you from crayons to perfume?\nIt isn't easy, but I'll try\nI'll try\n[Chorus]\nIf you wanted the sky\nWrite across the sky in letters\nThat would soar a thousand feet high\n\"To Sir, with love\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe time has come\nFor closing books and long last looks must end\nAnd as I leave\nI know that I am leaving my best friend\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nA friend who taught me right from wrong\nAnd weak from strong, that's a lot to learn\nWhat, what can I give you in return?\nOh, oh\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you wanted the moon\nI would try to make a start\nBut I would rather you let me give my heart\nTo Sir, with love\nIf you wanted the moon\nI would try to make a start\nBut I would rather you let me give my

live?\nWhat's it all about when you sort it out, Alfie?\nAre we meant to take more than we give?\nOr are we meant to be kind?\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd if only fools are kind, Alfie\nThen I guess it is wise to be cruel\nAnd if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie\nWhat will you lend on an old golden rule?\n[Bridge]\nAs sure as I believe there's a heaven above, Alfie\nI know there's something much more\nSomething even non-believers can believe in\n\n[Verse 3]\nI believe in love, Alfie\nWithout true love we just exist, Alfie\nUntil you find the love you've missed you're nothing, Alfie\nWhen you walk let your heart lead the way\nAnd you'll find love any day, Alfie\nAlfieSee Dionne Warwick LiveGet tickets as low as $86You might also like1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

Fled.\n\nThe flossies all and mossies all they drooped upon her draped brimfall. The bowknots, the showlots, they wilted into woeblots. The pearlagraph, the pearlagraph, knew whitchly whether to weep or laugh. For always down in Carolinas lovely Dinahs vaunt their view.\nPoor Isa sits a glooming so gleaming in the gloaming; the tin-celles a touch tarnished wind no lovelinoise awound her swan\u2019s. Hey, lass! Woefear gleam she so glooming, this pooripathete I solde? Her beauman\u2019s gone of a cool. Be good enough to symper-ise. If he\u2019s at anywhere she\u2019s therefor to join him.

She is fading out like Journee\u2019s clothes so you can\u2019t see her now. Still we know how Day the Dyer works, in dims and deeps and dusks and darks. And among the shades that Eve\u2019s now wearing she\u2019ll meet anew fiancy, tryst and trow. Mammy was, Mimmy is, Minuscoline\u2019s to be. In the Dee dips a dame and the dame desires a demselle but the demselle dresses dolly and the dolly does a dulcydamble. The same renew. For though she\u2019s unmerried she\u2019ll after truss up and help that hussyband how to hop. Hip it and trip it and chirrub and sing. Lord Chuffy\u2019s sky sheraph and Glugg\u2019s got to swing.\n\nSo and so, toe by toe, to and fro they go round, for they are the ingelles, scattering nods as girls who may, for they are an angel\u2019s garland.\nCatchmire stockings, libertyed garters, shoddyshoes, quicked out with selver. Pennyfair caps on pinnyfore frocks and a ring on her fomefing finger. And they leap so looply, looply, as they link to light. And they look so loovely, loovelit, noosed in a nuptious night. Withasly glints in. Andecoy glants out. They ramp it a little, a lessle, a lissle. Then rompride round in rout.\n\nSay them all but tell them apart, cadenzando coloratura! R is Rubretta and A is Arancia, Y is for Yilla and N for greeneriN. B is Boyblue with odalisque O while W waters the fleurettes of no-vembrance. Though they\u2019re all but merely a schoolgirl yet these way went they. I\u2019 th\u2019 view o\u2019 th\u2019avignue dancing goes entrancing roundly. Miss Oodles of Anems before the Luvium doeslike. So. And then again doeslike. So. And miss Endles of Eons efter Dies of Eirae doeslike. So. And then again doeslike. So. The many wiles of Winsure.\n\nThe grocer\u2019s bawd she slips her hand in the haricot bag, the lady in waiting sips her sup from the paraffin can, Mrs Wildhare Quickdoctor helts her skelts up the casuaway the flasht instinct she herds if a tinkle of tunder, the widow Megrievy she knits cats\u2019 cradles, this bountiful actress leashes a harrier under her tongue, and here\u2019s the girl who she\u2019s kneeled in coldfashion and she\u2019s told her priest (spt!) she\u2019s pot on a chap (chp!) and this lass not least, this rickissime woman, who she writes foot fortunes money times over in the nursery dust with her capital thumb. Buzz. All run-away sheep bound back bopeep, trailing their teenes behind them. And these ways wend they. And those ways went they. Winnie, Olive and Beatrice, Nelly and Ida, Amy and Rue. Here they come back, all the gay pack, for they are the florals, from foncey and pansey to papavere\u2019s blush, foresake-me-nought, while there\u2019s leaf there\u2019s hope, with primtim\u2019s ruse and marry-may\u2019s blossom, all the flowers of the ancelles\u2019 garden.\n\nBut vicereversing thereout from those palms of perfection to anger arbour, treerack monatan, scroucely out of scout of ocean, virid with woad, what tornaments of complementary rages rocked the divlun from his punchpoll to his tummy\u2019s shentre as he dis-plaid all the oathword science of his visible disgrace. He was feeling so funny and floored for the cue, all over which girls as he don\u2019t know whose hue. If goosseys gazious would but fain smile him a smile he would be fondling a praise he ate some nice bit of fluff. But no geste reveals the unconnouth. They\u2019re all odds against him, the beasties. Scratch. Start.\n\nHe dove his head into Wat Murrey, gave Stewart Ryall a puck on the plexus, wrestled a hurry-come-union with the Gillie Beg, wiped all his sinses, martial and menial, out of Shrove Sundy MacFearsome, excremuncted as freely as any frothblower into MacIsaac, had a belting bout, chaste to chaste, with McAdoo about nothing and, childhood\u2019s age being aye the shameleast, tel a Tartaran tastarin toothsome tarrascone tourtoun, vestimentiv-orous chlamydophagian, imbretellated himself for any time un tellable with what hung over to the Machonochie Middle from the MacSiccaries of the Breeks.

And Unkel Silanse coach in diligence. Discon-nection of the succeeding. He wholehog himself for carberry banishment care of Pencylmania, Bretish Armerica, to melt Mrs Gloria of the Bunkers\u2019 Trust, recorporated, (prunty!) by meteo-romancy and linguified heissrohgin, quit to hail a hurry laracor and catch the Paname\u2013Turricum and regain that absendee tarry easty, his citta immediata, by an alley and detour with farecard awailable getrennty years. Right for Rovy the Roder. From the safe side of distance! Libera, nostalgia! Beate Laurentie O\u2019Tuli, Euro pra nobis! Every monk his own cashel where every little ligger is his own liogotenente with inclined jambs in full purview to his pronaose and to the deretane at his reredoss. Fuisfinister, fuyerescaper! He would, with the greatest of ease, before of weighting midhook, by dear home trashold on the raging canal, for othersites of Jorden, (heave a hevy, waterboy!) make one of hissens with a knockonacow and a chow collegions and fire off, gheol ghiornal, foull subustioned mullmud, his farced epistol to the hibruws.

around\nBut for me they come a tumblin' down\nEvery day heartaches grow a little stronger\nI can't stand this pain much longer\n\n[Verse 3]\nI walk in shadows searching for light\nCold and alone no comfort in sight\nHoping and praying for someone to care\nAlways moving and going nowhere\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat becomes of the brokenhearted\nWho had love that's now departed\nI know I've got to find\nSome kind of peace of mind\nHelp me\n\n[Verse 4]\nI'm searching though I don't succeed\nBut someone look, there's a growing need\nAll is lost, there's no place for beginning\nAll that's left is an unhappy ending\n\n[Chorus]\nNow what becomes of the broken-hearted\nWho had love that's now departed\nI know I've got to find\nSome kind of peace of mind\nI'll be searching everywhere\nJust to find someone to care\nYou might also like[Outro]\nI'll be looking everyday\nI know I'm gonna find a way\nNothing's gonna stop me now\nI'll find a way somehow\nI'll be searching everywhere\nI know I'm gonna find a way2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 20, "api_path": "/songs/332798", "artist_names": "The Mamas & The Papas", "full_title": "California Dreamin' by\u00a0The\u00a0Mamas & The

crazy\n'Cause a walk in the park all alone is just no fun\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat two can easily do, what two can easily do\nIs so hard to be done by one\n[Verse 2]\nI'm sure that you know that I love you with all of my heart\nBut a love that's true really takes two to start\nI wanna do my share\nTo show you that I care\n'Cause a one-sided love will never do\nYou gotta show me that you love me too\n'Cause falling in love all alone is just no fun\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat two can easily do, what two can easily do\nIs so hard to be done by one\n\n[Verse 3]\nOne can build a love affair slowly\nTwo can build a love affair fast\nOne can make a love get started\nTwo can make it last\n\n[Bridge]\nCome on and take me by the hand\nLead me up to the preacher man\nTogether we can do all the things that

Oh, what, now you\u2019re a star?\nNo, you\u2019re still broke, bummy, scrounging for rounds at the bar\nSo I consider the term \u201ctitle\u201d not sounding so hard\nWhen you\u2019ll never have a title on a house or a car\nSee, you never rap enough piff to pack up the joint\nAnd so they made a call to Rone (Calderon) to back up the point\nSee we could battle for one hour.

Well I doubt it for sure\nRenowned or obscure, I never heard a sound you recorded\nBitch, you\u2019ve been making music since 2004\nAnd I still haven\u2019t listened to one album of yours\nAnd the fans of your rap music are white as a Klan unit\nI\u2019m tryin' to make him embrace it, but damn it, he can\u2019t do it\nHe should be grassroot-ing, but instead he pack-mule-ing\n\u2018lac cruising, gat shooting, back of the tan Buick\nSaid you had nicks (Knicks) for starters, like Al Houston and Pat Ewing\nWhat\u2019s next, you makin' gram movements like Fat Jewish?\nWell, that lightweight angle is shaky as Shaq shootin'\nAnd that\u2019s stupid as Atlanta fans rootin' for Cam Newton\nBoy, you said your dream battle\u2019s Jin\nI couldn\u2019t give a shit less\nIt\u2019s funny a little Asian kid couldn\u2019t make you a success (6's)\nIt\u2019s a vignette on forgotten skill and a prequel to popping pills\nIt\u2019s sick how you think you\u2019re sick\nHow the mighty have fallen Ill\nBro. Pat Stay\u2019s first was all short jokes to put this herb down\nSo for me to try any of that shit would be retarded\nBut I gave Pat Stay every short joke he used in his first round\nSo I was up one nothing before this battle even started\nI don\u2019t have short jokes; I don\u2019t have short facts\nI don\u2019t have short quotes; I just have short math\nLookism\nA guy who\u2019s 5\u20196\u201d has to make $183,000 a year\nMore than someone who is 6\u2019 to be deemed equally attractive\nThat\u2019s $24,000 an inch, that\u2019s the fraction we\u2019ll use\nAnd what I did is I took my height and subtract it from dude\u2019s\nSo look at you, 5\u20195\u201d, but that\u2019s adding a few;\nSo Google me. 6\u20191 and a half or 6\u20192\u201d\nBefore this battle even starts, by all the math that I do\nI\u2019m already a quarter million dollars more attractive than you\nAnd there\u2019s nothin' you can do about it, you know that it\u2019s unfair\nYou could be Brad Pitt in the face and no woman would care\nI mean, there\u2019s height restrictions in the military, I don\u2019t know why; it\u2019s disgusting\nBut of course you hate the government, you\u2019re too short to die for your country\nSo that explains his head condition\nHis conspiracies, his pessimism\nAnother adolescent victim, short, poor, expecting visits\nFrom a daddy who\u2019d never swing it, so rage done festered in him\nAnd he turned it against the system\nBut being short is no excuse for being a mental midget\nI mean, you hate yourself for being short, I can tell it through your face\nBut look on the bright side; there\u2019s less of you hate\nAnd losses are a positive, so you should see some growth from this\nBut the fact is, you\u2019re 5\u20193\u201d and you just can\u2019t get over it\nHe\u2019s jealous I call myself the Prince, like that should describe you\nWell, maybe you\u2019re right, too, \u2018cause you and Prince are both 5\u20192\u201d\nI call myself the Prince as a Symbol, that I\u2019m forging my own path\nI call myself the Prince \u2018cause it will always be something I was formerly known as\nLike: 2056, in a nursing home. T-Rex\u2019s granddaughter is nursin' holmes\nBrittle bones, decrepit clothes, shoes too big for your feet\nCause after all the years of gravity, he\u2019s shrunken to 4\u20193\u201d\nHe\u2019s past the whole rapping thing, now he\u2019s battling for his sanity\nDementia and Alzheimer\u2019s; he can\u2019t recognize his own family\nSo they don\u2019t visit, he\u2019s so lonely; his incontinent useless ass\nWell one of the nurses, somehow, hears that he used to rap\nSo as a birthday present, she decides to drag a classic out\nGets all the invalids, the old people, and has them gather \u2018round\nShe says it\u2019s Illmac versus Rone, but then he panics at the sound\nCause as soon as he hears my name, then he flashes back to now\nAnd suddenly, he\u2019s wishin; for his casket and his death\nSuddenly, he\u2019s short of air and he\u2019s grabbing for his neck\nAnd if that was then and this is now, and you\u2019re still panicking' through sweat\nThen imagine just how bad it was at the actual event\n\n[Round 3: Illmaculate]\nHe keeps bringing up conspiracies, and half of you laugh\nWell, I must be a conspiracy theorist; that\u2019s actually facts\nShit, I feel like B.O.B. with what Adam just rapped\n\u2018cause I swear that entire round was actually flat\nAs a matter fact, you talking \u2018bout my drugs, when I got caught for the case\nHe didn\u2019t mention my P\u2019s, did he (Diddy)?\nI mean that\u2019d be perfect, \u2018cause his most-reacted line is when he remixed me\n(P Diddy - Remix me? Fuck all that.)\nWhat you looking at? You are not a man. You will never be a man\nYou know why? He let Pat palm the back of his head with his hand\nNever mind Sandusky molesting this bitch\nYouTube \u201cgetting brains in the lac\u201d. I didn\u2019t edit this shit\nIt\u2019s a video of you giving Pat head in the whip\nYou don\u2019t remember the clip? You didn\u2019t think I would mention this shit?\nPat looked like MadChild last Blackout\nA Swollen Member getting neck while he\u2019s stiff\nThe video starts, Pat getting head in the car, nothing too embarrassing in it\nTil it\u2019s revealed it\u2019s not a girl, it\u2019s you\nGenius, being gay is hilarious\nGet it?\n(No? Me either.)\nTell me this: what was the moment you became aware they were taping there?\nWas it when Pat came, you came up for air, wiped your facial hair\nAfter treating Pat\u2019s dick like you was \u2018bout to find the chain in there?\nI guess we just from two different scenes\nCause I ain\u2019t trying to get on YouTube and watch men (Watchmen) do shit obscene\nYou normally play the Comedian, but in that new clip I seen\nYou just went Dr. Manhattan on us: just blew(blue) dick on screen\nHey, fuck it though. You should get a letterman jacket for pleasuring Pat\nGiving head in the \u2018lac\nYo, I guess when he lettered in track\nAin\u2019t the only time he\u2019s ever been a(-)head in a lap\nWe both battled Pat. Look how we related to him\nI left with Pat\u2019s head. You gave it to him\nHow did that relationship start? Does he think that it\u2019s fate as well?\nOr did you just slide in his DMs like, \u201cA/S/L\u201d?\nThat shit\u2019s gay as hell, and you taped it. Well\nI don\u2019t care he made it, he\u2019s Larry David: he played himself\nYou know what? You\u2019re the most disrespected battler. Pesci ain\u2019t got shit on you\nDaylyt left the stage and dipped on you. Pat Stay put his dick on you\nDiz made you dress up as Bruce Jenner and put a wig on you\nNow, I\u2019m \u2018bout to wig on you\nThe judge decide the outcome, think Pimp a Butterfly album:\nI got schitz(skits) on you\nSlap that Roney Baby the Prince off you;\nCold case. Charron\u2019s face: leave prints on you\nBreak you down; put it together: I\u2019ll jigsaw you\nShow up to your improv group, impromptu, insult the chick on you\nDiss her, and spit on you. No, Diz / Eurgh spit on you\nI\u2019ll diss her(Eurgh) and leave: Irvine crip on you\nWalk in your crib on you, skip the welcome mat, wipe my kicks on you\nSlap the cereal bowl out your hand and go Queenzflip in the whip on you\nWhen I whip on you\nYou know what? It\u2019s something bothering me, I just can\u2019t ignore it\nEverybody blames Sandusky; they got the facts distorted\nI mean, if you seen what Rone was wearing, he was practically asking for it\nForget the rape. That\u2019s a subject that we\u2019ll avoid\nI mean, I had to mention it; I didn\u2019t have any choice\nBut now it\u2019s a tactic employed he\u2019s learned to handle with poise\nSo fuck it, I\u2019ll bell-clap him. Won\u2019t hear any actual noise\nFlat on canvas, no punch landed; you scrapping with Floyd\nShoulder lock, crack clavicle; grapple on point\nJab like Zab; jaw tap him like Roy\nBody blow, head shot; his jaw crack like his voice\nMandible snapped at the joint\nHey yo Sandusky! That\u2019s how you put hands on this boy\nAnd as you just seen, I beat his ass so badly\nI\u2019m on my next lap.

cruel world\nI'm off to join the circus\nGonna be a broken-hearted clown (Ah)\nPaint my face with a good-for-nothin' smile\n'Cause a mean, fickle woman\nTurned my whole world upside-down\n(Goodbye, cruel world)\n[Verse 2]\nFarewell to love (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nI'm off to join the circus\nGotta find a way to hide my tears (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nThen I'll have them rollin' in the aisle (Ah)\nAnd I'll forget that woman\nIf it takes a hundred years\n(Goodbye, cruel world, ooh)\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, step right up (Ooh)\nAnd take a look at a fool (Doo-da-loo-doo-doo)\nHe has got a heart (Doo-da-doo)\nAs stubborn as a mule (Doo-da-loo-doo, ah)\nCome on, everybody, he's good for a laugh\nAnd no one could tell his heart is broken in half\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, the joke's on me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nI'm off to join the circus\nOh, Mr. Barnum, save a place for me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nShoot me out of a cannon, I don't care (Ah)\nLet the people point at me and stare (Ah)\nI'll tell the world that woman (Ah, ah)\nWherever she may be (Ah)\nThat mean, fickle woman made a cryin' clown out of me\n(Goodbye, cruel world)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nShoot me out of a cannon, I don't care (Ah)\nLet the people

"The Works of Lord Byron, Vol. 1 (Hints From Horace) LyricsHints From Horace\n\nATHENS: CAPUCHIN CONVENT, March. 12, 1811. [i]\n\nWho would not laugh, if Lawrence [1], hired to grace [ii]\nHis costly canvas with each flattered face,\nAbused his art, till Nature, with a blush,\nSaw cits grow Centaurs underneath his brush?\nOr, should some limner join, for show or sale,\nA Maid of Honour to a Mermaid's tail? [iii]\nOr low Dubost [2]\u2014as once the world has seen\u2014\nDegrade God's creatures in his graphic spleen?\nNot all that forced politeness, which defends\nFools in their faults, could gag his grinning friends.\nBelieve me, Moschus, like that picture seems [iv]\nThe book which, sillier than a sick man's dreams,\nDisplays a crowd of figures incomplete,\nPoetic Nightmares, without head or feet.\nPoets and painters, as all artists know, [v]\nMay shoot a little with a lengthened bow;\nWe claim this mutual mercy for our task,\nAnd grant in turn the pardon which we ask;\nBut make not monsters spring from gentle dams\u2014\nBirds breed not vipers, tigers nurse not lambs.\n\nA laboured, long Exordium, sometimes tends\n(Like patriot speeches) but to paltry ends; [vi]\nAnd nonsense in a lofty note goes down,\nAs Pertness passes with a legal gown: [vii]\nThus many a Bard describes in pompous strain [viii]\nThe clear brook babbling through the goodly plain:\nThe groves of Granta, and her Gothic halls,\nKing's Coll-Cam's stream-stained windows, and old walls:\nOr, in adventurous numbers, neatly aims\nTo paint a rainbow, or the river Thames. [3]\n\nYou sketch a tree, and so perhaps may shine [ix]\u2014\nBut daub a shipwreck like an alehouse sign;\nYou plan a vase\u2014it dwindles to a pot;\nThen glide down Grub-street\u2014fasting and forgot:\nLaughed into Lethe by some quaint Review,\nWhose wit is never troublesome till\u2014true.\nIn fine, to whatsoever you aspire,\nLet it at least be simple and entire.\nThe greater portion of the rhyming tribe [x]\n(Give ear, my friend, for thou hast been a scribe)\nAre led astray by some peculiar lure. [xi]\nI labour to be brief\u2014become obscure;\nOne falls while following Elegance too fast;\nAnother soars, inflated with Bombast;\nToo low a third crawls on, afraid to fly,\nHe spins his subject to Satiety;\nAbsurdly varying, he at last engraves\nFish in the woods, and boars beneath the waves! [xii]\nUnless your care's exact, your judgment nice,\nThe flight from Folly leads but into Vice;\n\nNone are complete, all wanting in some part,\nLike certain tailors, limited in art.\nFor galligaskins Slowshears is your man [xiii]\nBut coats must claim another artisan. [4]\nNow this to me, I own, seems much the same\nAs Vulcan's feet to bear Apollo's frame;\nOr, with a fair complexion, to expose\nBlack eyes, black ringlets, but\u2014a bottle nose!\nDear Authors! suit your topics to your strength,\nAnd ponder well your subject, and its length;\n\nNor lift your load, before you're quite aware\nWhat weight your shoulders will, or will not, bear.\nBut lucid Order, and Wit's siren voice, [xiv]\nAwait the Poet, skilful in his choice;\nWith native Eloquence he soars along,\nGrace in his thoughts, and Music in his song.\nLet Judgment teach him wisely to combine\nWith future parts the now omitted line:\nThis shall the Author choose, or that reject,\nPrecise in style, and cautious to select;\nNor slight applause will candid pens afford\nTo him who furnishes a wanting word. [xv]\nThen fear not, if 'tis needful, to produce\nSome term unknown, or obsolete in use,\n(As Pitt has furnished us a word or two, [5]\nWhich Lexicographers declined to do;)\nSo you indeed, with care,\u2014(but be content\nTo take this license rarely)\u2014may invent.\nNew words find credit in these latter days,\nIf neatly grafted on a Gallic phrase; [xvi]\n\nWhat Chaucer, Spenser did, we scarce refuse\nTo Dryden's or to Pope's maturer Muse.\nIf you can add a little, say why not,\nAs well as William Pitt, and Walter Scott?\nSince they, by force of rhyme and force of lungs, [xvii]\nEnriched our Island's ill-united tongues;\n'Tis then\u2014and shall be\u2014lawful to present\nReform in writing, as in Parliament.\nAs forests shed their foliage by degrees,\nSo fade expressions which in season please;\n\nAnd we and ours, alas! are due to Fate,\nAnd works and words but dwindle to a date.\nThough as a Monarch nods, and Commerce calls, [xviii]\nImpetuous rivers stagnate in canals;\nThough swamps subdued, and marshes drained, sustain [xix]\nThe heavy ploughshare and the yellow grain,\nAnd rising ports along the busy shore\nProtect the vessel from old Ocean's roar,\nAll, all, must perish; but, surviving last,\nThe love of Letters half preserves the past.\n\nTrue, some decay, yet not a few revive; [xx] [6]\nThough those shall sink, which now appear to thrive,\nAs Custom arbitrates, whose shifting sway [xxi]\nOur life and language must alike obey.\nThe immortal wars which Gods and Angels wage,\nAre they not shown in Milton's sacred page?\nHis strain will teach what numbers best belong\nTo themes celestial told in Epic song. [xxii]\nThe slow, sad stanza will correctly paint\nThe Lover's anguish, or the Friend's complaint.\n\nBut which deserves the Laurel\u2014Rhyme or Blank? [xxiii]\nWhich holds on Helicon the higher rank?\nLet squabbling critics by themselves dispute\nThis point, as puzzling as a Chancery suit.\nSatiric rhyme first sprang from selfish spleen.\nYou doubt\u2014see Dryden, Pope, St. Patrick's Dean. [7]\nBlank verse is now, with one consent, allied\nTo Tragedy, and rarely quits her side.\nThough mad Almanzor [8] rhymed in Dryden's days,\nNo sing-song Hero rants in modern plays;\n\nWhilst modest Comedy her verse foregoes\nFor jest and 'pun' [9] in very middling prose.\nNot that our Bens or Beaumonts show the worse,\nOr lose one point, because they wrote in verse.\nBut so Thalia pleases to appear, [xxiv]\nPoor Virgin! damned some twenty times a year!\nWhate'er the scene, let this advice have weight:\u2014\nAdapt your language to your Hero's state.\nAt times Melpomene forgets to groan,\nAnd brisk Thalia takes a serious tone;\n\nNor unregarded will the act pass by\nWhere angry Townly [10] \"lifts his voice on high.\"\nAgain, our Shakespeare limits verse to Kings,\nWhen common prose will serve for common things;\nAnd lively Hal resigns heroic ire, [xxv]\u2014\nTo \"hollaing Hotspur\" [11] and his sceptred sire. [xxvi]\n'Tis not enough, ye Bards, with all your art,\nTo polish poems; they must touch the heart:\nWhere'er the scene be laid, whate'er the song,\nStill let it bear the hearer's soul along;\n\nCommand your audience or to smile or weep,\nWhiche'er may please you\u2014anything but sleep.\nThe Poet claims our tears; but, by his leave,\nBefore I shed them, let me see 'him' grieve.\nIf banished Romeo feigned nor sigh nor tear,\nLulled by his languor, I could sleep or sneer. [xxvii]\nSad words, no doubt, become a serious face,\nAnd men look angry in the proper place.\nAt double meanings folks seem wondrous sly,\nAnd Sentiment prescribes a pensive eye;\n\nFor Nature formed at first the inward man,\nAnd actors copy Nature\u2014when they can.\nShe bids the beating heart with rapture bound,\nRaised to the Stars, or levelled with the ground;\nAnd for Expression's aid, 'tis said, or sung, [xxviii]\nShe gave our mind's interpreter\u2014the tongue,\nWho, worn with use, of late would fain dispense\n(At least in theatres) with common sense;\nO'erwhelm with sound the Boxes, Gallery, Pit,\nAnd raise a laugh with anything\u2014but Wit.\n\nTo skilful writers it will much import,\nWhence spring their scenes, from common life or Court;\nWhether they seek applause by smile or tear,\nTo draw a Lying Valet, [12] or a Lear, [13]\nA sage, or rakish youngster wild from school,\nA wandering Peregrine, or plain John Bull;\nAll persons please when Nature's voice prevails,\nScottish or Irish, born in Wilts or Wales.\nOr follow common fame, or forge a plot; [xxix]\nWho cares if mimic heroes lived or not!\n\nOne precept serves to regulate the scene:\nMake it appear as if it might have been.\nIf some Drawcansir [14] you aspire to draw,\nPresent him raving, and above all law:\nIf female furies in your scheme are planned,\nMacbeth's fierce dame is ready to your hand;\nFor tears and treachery, for good and evil,\nConstance, King Richard, Hamlet, and the Devil!\nBut if a new design you dare essay,\nAnd freely wander from the beaten way,\n\nTrue to your characters, till all be past,\nPreserve consistency from first to last.\nTis hard [15] to venture where our betters fail, [xxx]\nOr lend fresh interest to a twice-told tale;\nAnd yet, perchance,'tis wiser to prefer\nA hackneyed plot, than choose a new, and err;\nYet copy not too closely, but record,\nMore justly, thought for thought than word for word;\nNor trace your Prototype through narrow ways,\nBut only follow where he merits praise.\n\nFor you, young Bard! whom luckless fate may lead [16]\nTo tremble on the nod of all who read,\nEre your first score of cantos Time unrolls, [xxxi]\nBeware\u2014for God's sake, don't begin like Bowles!\n\"Awake a louder and a loftier strain,\" [17]\u2014\nAnd pray, what follows from his boiling brain?\u2014\nHe sinks to Southey's level in a trice,\nWhose Epic Mountains never fail in mice!\nNot so of yore awoke your mighty Sire\nThe tempered warblings of his master-lyre;\n\nSoft as the gentler breathing of the lute,\n\"Of Man's first disobedience and the fruit\"\nHe speaks, but, as his subject swells along,\nEarth, Heaven, and Hades echo with the song.\"[xxxii]\nStill to the \"midst of things\" he hastens on,\nAs if we witnessed all already done; [xxxiii]\nLeaves on his path whatever seems too mean\nTo raise the subject, or adorn the scene;\nGives, as each page improves upon the sight,\nNot smoke from brightness, but from darkness\u2014light;\n\nAnd truth and fiction with such art compounds,\nWe know not where to fix their several bounds.\nIf you would please the Public, deign to hear\nWhat soothes the many-headed monster's ear: [xxxiv]\nIf your heart triumph when the hands of all\nApplaud in thunder at the curtain's fall,\nDeserve those plaudits\u2014study Nature's page,\nAnd sketch the striking traits of every age;\nWhile varying Man and varying years unfold\nLife's little tale, so oft, so vainly told;\n\nObserve his simple childhood's dawning days,\nHis pranks, his prate, his playmates, and his plays:\nTill time at length the mannish tyro weans,\nAnd prurient vice outstrips his tardy teens! [xxxv]\nBehold him Freshman! forced no more to groan [xxxvi]\nO'er Virgil's [18] devilish verses and his own;\nPrayers are too tedious, Lectures too abstruse,\nHe flies from Tavell's frown to \"Fordham's Mews;\"\n(Unlucky Tavell! [19] doomed to daily cares [xxxvii]\nBy pugilistic pupils, and by bears,)\n\nFines, Tutors, tasks, Conventions threat in vain,\nBefore hounds, hunters, and Newmarket Plain.\nRough with his elders, with his equals rash,\nCivil to sharpers, prodigal of cash;\nConstant to nought\u2014save hazard and a whore, [xxxviii]\nYet cursing both\u2014for both have made him sore:\nUnread (unless since books beguile disease,\nThe P\u2014\u2014x becomes his passage to Degrees);\nFooled, pillaged, dunned, he wastes his terms away, [xxxix]\nAnd unexpelled, perhaps, retires M.A.;\n\nMaster of Arts! as hells and clubs [20] proclaim, [xl]\nWhere scarce a blackleg bears a brighter name!\nLaunched into life, extinct his early fire,\nHe apes the selfish prudence of his Sire;\nMarries for money, chooses friends for rank,\nBuys land, and shrewdly trusts not to the Bank;\nSits in the Senate; gets a son and heir;\nSends him to Harrow\u2014for himself was there.\nMute, though he votes, unless when called to cheer,\nHis son's so sharp\u2014he'll see the dog a Peer!\n\nManhood declines\u2014Age palsies every limb;\nHe quits the scene\u2014or else the scene quits him;\nScrapes wealth, o'er each departing penny grieves, [xli]\nAnd Avarice seizes all Ambition leaves;\nCounts cent per cent, and smiles, or vainly frets,\nO'er hoards diminished by young Hopeful's debts;\nWeighs well and wisely what to sell or buy,\nComplete in all life's lessons\u2014but to die;\nPeevish and spiteful, doting, hard to please,\nCommending every time, save times like these;\n\nCrazed, querulous, forsaken, half forgot,\nExpires unwept\u2014is buried\u2014Let him rot!\nBut from the Drama let me not digress,\nNor spare my precepts, though they please you less. [xlii]\nThough Woman weep, and hardest hearts are stirred, [xliii]\nWhen what is done is rather seen than heard,\nYet many deeds preserved in History's page\nAre better told than acted on the stage;\nThe ear sustains what shocks the timid eye,\nAnd Horror thus subsides to Sympathy,\n\nTrue Briton all beside, I here am French\u2014\nBloodshed 'tis surely better to retrench:\nThe gladiatorial gore we teach to flow\nIn tragic scenes disgusts though but in show;\nWe hate the carnage while we see the trick,\nAnd find small sympathy in being sick.\nNot on the stage the regicide Macbeth\nAppals an audience with a Monarch's death; [xliv]\nTo gaze when sable Hubert threats to sear\nYoung Arthur's eyes, can ours or Nature bear?\n\nA haltered heroine [21] Johnson sought to slay\u2014\nWe saved Irene, but half damned the play,\nAnd (Heaven be praised!) our tolerating times\nStint Metamorphoses to Pantomimes;\nAnd Lewis' [22] self, with all his sprites, would quake\nTo change Earl Osmond's negro to a snake!\nBecause, in scenes exciting joy or grief,\nWe loathe the action which exceeds belief:\nAnd yet, God knows! what may not authors do,\nWhose Postscripts prate of dyeing \"heroines blue\"? [23]\n\nAbove all things, Dan Poet, if you can,\nEke out your acts, I pray, with mortal man,\nNor call a ghost, unless some cursed scrape [xlv]\nMust open ten trap-doors for your escape.\nOf all the monstrous things I'd fain forbid,\nI loathe an Opera worse than Dennis did; [24]\nWhere good and evil persons, right or wrong,\nRage, love, and aught but moralise\u2014in song.\nHail, last memorial of our foreign friends, [xlvi]\nWhich Gaul allows, and still Hesperia lends!\n\nNapoleon's edicts no embargo lay\nOn whores\u2014spies\u2014singers\u2014wisely shipped away.\nOur giant Capital, whose squares are spread [xlvii]\nWhere rustics earned, and now may beg, their bread,\nIn all iniquity is grown so nice,\nIt scorns amusements which are not of price.\nHence the pert shopkeeper, whose throbbing ear\nAches with orchestras which he pays to hear, [xlviii]\nWhom shame, not sympathy, forbids to snore,\nHis anguish doubling by his own \"encore;\" [xlix]\n\nSqueezed in \"Fop's Alley,\" [25] jostled by the beaux,\nTeased with his hat, and trembling for his toes;\nScarce wrestles through the night, nor tastes of ease,\nTill the dropped curtain gives a glad release:\nWhy this, and more, he suffers\u2014can ye guess?\u2014\nBecause it costs him dear, and makes him dress! [26]\nSo prosper eunuchs from Etruscan schools;\nGive us but fiddlers, and they're sure of fools!\nEre scenes were played by many a reverend clerk, [l] [27]\n(What harm, if David danced before the ark?) [li]\n\nIn Christmas revels, simple country folks\nWere pleased with morrice-mumm'ry and coarse jokes.\nImproving years, with things no longer known,\nProduced blithe Punch and merry Madame Joan,\nWho still frisk on with feats so lewdly low, [lii]\n'Tis strange Benvolio [28] suffers such a show;\nSuppressing peer! to whom each vice gives place, [liii]\nOaths, boxing, begging\u2014all, save rout and race.\nFarce followed Comedy, and reached her prime,\nIn ever-laughing Foote's fantastic time: [29]\n\nMad wag! who pardoned none, nor spared the best,\nAnd turned some very serious things to jest.\nNor Church nor State escaped his public sneers,\nArms nor the Gown\u2014Priests\u2014Lawyers\u2014Volunteers:\n\"Alas, poor Yorick!\" now for ever mute!\nWhoever loves a laugh must sigh for Foote.\nWe smile, perforce, when histrionic scenes\nApe the swoln dialogue of Kings and Queens,\nWhen \"Crononhotonthologos must die,\" [30]\nAnd Arthur struts in mimic majesty.\n\nMoschus! with whom once more I hope to sit, [liv]\nAnd smile at folly, if we can't at wit;\nYes, Friend! for thee I'll quit my cynic cell,\nAnd bear Swift's motto, \"Vive la bagatelle!\"\nWhich charmed our days in each \u00c6gean clime,\nAs oft at home, with revelry and rhyme.\nThen may Euphrosyne, who sped the past,\nSoothe thy Life's scenes, nor leave thee in the last;\nBut find in thine\u2014like pagan Plato's bed, [lv] [31]\nSome merry Manuscript of Mimes, when dead.\n\nNow to the Drama let us bend our eyes,\nWhere fettered by whig Walpole low she lies; [32]\nCorruption foiled her, for she feared her glance;\nDecorum left her for an Opera dance!\nYet Chesterfield, [33] whose polished pen inveighs\n'Gainst laughter, fought for freedom to our Plays;\nUnchecked by Megrims of patrician brains,\nAnd damning Dulness of Lord Chamberlains.\nRepeal that act! again let Humour roam\nWild o'er the stage\u2014we've time for tears at home;\n\nLet Archer [34] plant the horns on Sullen's brows,\nAnd Estifania gull her \"Copper\" [35] spouse;\nThe moral's scant\u2014but that may be excused,\nMen go not to be lectured, but amused.\nHe whom our plays dispose to Good or Ill\nMust wear a head in want of Willis' skill; [36]\nAye, but Macheath's example\u2014psha!\u2014no more!\nIt formed no thieves\u2014the thief was formed before; [37]\nAnd spite of puritans and Collier's curse, [lvi]\nPlays make mankind no better, and no worse. [38]\n\nThen spare our stage, ye methodistic men!\nNor burn damned Drury if it rise again.

Dacier, Mons. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, Boileau, and others, have left their dispute on the meaning of this sentence in a tract considerably longer than the poem of Horace. It is printed at the close of the eleventh volume of Madame de S\u00e9vign\u00e9's Letters, edited by Grouvelle, Paris, 1806. Presuming that all who can construe may venture an opinion on such subjects, particularly as so many who can't have taken the same liberty, I should have held \"my farthing candle\" as awkwardly as another, had not my respect for the wits of Louis 14th's Augustan \"Si\u00e8cle\" induced me to subjoin these illustrious authorities. I therefore offer:\n\nfirstly Boileau: \"Il est difficile de trailer des sujets qui sont \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de tout le monde d'une maniere qui vous les rende propres, ce qui s'appelle s'approprier un sujet par le tour qu'on y donne.\"\n\n2dly, Batteux: \"Mais il est bien difficile de donner des traits propres et individuels aux etres purement possibles.\"\n\n3dly, Dacier: \"Il est difficile de traiter convenablement ces caract\u00e8res que tout le monde peut inventer.\"\n\nMr. S\u00e9vign\u00e9's opinion and translation, consisting of some thirty pages, I omit, particularly as Mr. Grouvelle observes, \"La chose est bien remarquable, aucune de ces diverses interpretations ne parait \u00eatre la veritable.\" But, by way of comfort, it seems, fifty years afterwards, \"Le lumineux Dumarsais\" made his appearance, to set Horace on his legs again, \"dissiper tous les nuages, et concilier tous les dissentiments;\" and I suppose some fifty years hence, somebody, still more luminous, will doubtless start up and demolish Dumarsais and his system on this weighty affair, as if he were no better than Ptolemy or Copernicus and comments of no more consequence than astronomical calculations. I am happy to say, \"la longueur de la dissertation\" of Mr. D. prevents Mr. G. from saying any more on the matter. A better poet than Boileau, and at least as good a scholar as Mr. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, has said,\n\n\"A little learning is a dangerous thing.\"\n\nAnd by the above extract, it appears that a good deal may be rendered as useless to the Proprietors.\n\n[Byron chose the words in question, Difficile,' etc., as a motto for the first five cantos of 'Don Juan']\n\n[Footnote 16: About two years ago a young man named Townsend was announced by Mr. Cumberland, in a review (since deceased) [the 'London Review'], as being engaged in an epic poem to be entitled \"Armageddon.\" The plan and specimen promise much; but I hope neither to offend Mr. Townsend, nor his friends, by recommending to his attention the lines of Horace to which these rhymes allude. If Mr. Townsend succeeds in his undertaking, as there is reason to hope, how much will the world be indebted to Mr. Cumberland for bringing him before the public! But, till that eventful day arrives, it may be doubted whether the premature display of his plan (sublime as the ideas confessedly are) has not,\u2014by raising expectation too high, or diminishing curiosity, by developing his argument,\u2014rather incurred the hazard of injuring Mr. Townsend's future prospects. Mr. Cumberland (whose talents I shall not depreciate by the humble tribute of my praise) and Mr. Townsend must not suppose me actuated by unworthy motives in this suggestion. I wish the author all the success he can wish himself, and shall be truly happy to see epic poetry weighed up from the bathos where it lies sunken with Southey, Cottle, Cowley (Mrs. or Abraham), Ogilvy, Wilkie, Pye, and all the \"dull of past and present days.\" Even if he is not a 'Milton', he may be better than 'Blackmore'; if not a 'Homer', an 'Antimachus'. I should deem myself presumptuous, as a young man, in offering advice, were it not addressed to one still younger. Mr. Townsend has the greatest difficulties to encounter; but in conquering them he will find employment; in having conquered them, his reward. I know too well \"the scribbler's scoff, the critic's contumely;\" and I am afraid time will teach Mr. Townsend to know them better. Those who succeed, and those who do not, must bear this alike, and it is hard to say which have most of it. I trust that Mr. Townsend's share will be from 'envy'; he will soon know mankind well enough not to attribute this expression to malice.

Indeed, the public school penance of \"Long and Short\" is enough to beget an antipathy to poetry for the residue of a man's life, and, perhaps, so far may be an advantage.]\n\n[Footnote 19:\n\n\"'Infandum, regina, jubes renovare dolorem'.\"\n\nI dare say Mr. Tavell (to whom I mean no affront) will understand me; and it is no matter whether any one else does or no.\u2014To the above events, \"'qu\u00e6que ipse miserrima vidi, et quorum pars magna fui',\" all 'times' and 'terms' bear testimony.

We confess there is sufficient provocation, if not in the critique, at least in the satire, to urge a 'man of honour' to defy his assailant to mortal combat, and perhaps to warrant a man of law to 'declare' war in Westminster Hall. Of this we shall no doubt hear more in due time\"\n\n('Eclectic Review', May, 1809). Byron pretends to believe that the \"Christian\" Reviewers, actuated by stern zeal for piety, were making mischief in sober earnest. \"Heaviside\" (see last line of Byron's note) was the surgeon in attendance at the duel between Lord Falkland and Mr. A. Powell. (See 'English Bards', 1. 686, note 2.)]]\n\n[Footnote 56: Macbeth, act v. sc. 7.]\n\n[Footnote 57: See the critique of the 'Edinburgh Review' on 'Hours of\nIdleness', January, 1808.]\n[Footnote 58: \"Invenies alium, si te hic fastidit, Alexin.\"]\n\n[Footnote 59: Here 'MS. L.' (a) recommences.]\n\n[Footnote 60: John Jackson (1769-1845), better known as \"Gentleman\" Jackson, was champion of England from 1795 to 1803. His three fights were against Fewterel (1788), George Ingleston, nicknamed \"the Brewer\" (1789), and Mendoza (1795). In 1803 he retired from the ring. His rooms at 13, Bond Street, became the head-quarters of the Pugilistic Club. (See Pierce Egan's 'Life in London', pp. 252-254, where the rooms are described, and a drawing of them by Cruikshank is given.) Jackson's character stood high.\n\n\"From the highest to the lowest person in the Sporting World, his 'decision' is law.\"\n\nHe was Byron's guest at Cambridge, Newstead, and Brighton; received from him many letters; and is described by him, in a note to 'Don Juan' (xi. 19), as:\n\n\"my old friend and corporeal pastor and master.\"]\n\n[Footnote 61: Mr. Southey has lately tied another canister to his tail in 'The Curse of Kehama', maugre the neglect of 'Madoc', etc., and has in one instance had a wonderful effect. A literary friend of mine, walking out one lovely evening last summer, on the eleventh bridge of the Paddington canal, was alarmed by the cry of \"one in jeopardy:\" he rushed along, collected a body of Irish haymakers (supping on butter-milk in an adjacent paddock), procured three rakes, one eel-spear and a landing net, and at last ('horresco referens') pulled out\u2014his own publisher. The unfortunate man was gone for ever, and so was a large quarto wherewith he had taken the leap, which proved, on inquiry, to have been Mr. Southey's last work. Its \"alacrity of sinking\" was so great, that it has never since been heard of; though some maintain that it is at this moment concealed at Alderman Birch's pastry premises, Cornhill. Be this as it may, the coroner's inquest brought in a verdict of \"'Felo de bibliopol\u00e2'\" against a \"quarto unknown;\" and circumstantial evidence being since strong against 'The Curse of Kehama' (of which the above words are an exact description), it will be tried by its peers next session, in Grub-street\u2014Arthur, Alfred, Davideis, Richard Coeur de Lion, Exodus, Exodiad, Epigoniad, Calvary, Fall of Cambria, Siege of Acre, Don Roderick, and Tom Thumb the Great, are the names of the twelve jurors. The judges are Pye, Bowles, and the bell-man of St. Sepulchre's.\n\nThe same advocates, pro and con, will be employed as are now engaged in Sir F. Burdett's celebrated cause in the Scotch courts. The public anxiously await the result, and all 'live' publishers will be subpoenaed as witnesses.\u2014But Mr. Southey has published 'The Curse of Kehama',\u2014an inviting title to quibblers. By the bye, it is a good deal beneath Scott and Campbell, and not much above Southey, to allow the booby Ballantyne to entitle them, in the 'Edinburgh Annual Register' (of which, by the bye, Southey is editor) \"the grand poetical triumvirate of the day.\" But, on second thoughts, it can be no great degree of praise to be the one-eyed leaders of the blind, though they might as well keep to themselves \"Scott's thirty thousand copies sold,\" which must sadly discomfort poor Southey's unsaleables. Poor Southey, it should seem, is the \"Lepidus\" of this poetical triumvirate. I am only surprised to see him in such good company.\n\n\"Such things, we know, are neither rich nor rare,\nBut wonder how the devil 'he' came there.\"\nThe trio are well defined in the sixth proposition of Euclid:\u2014\n\n\"Because, in the triangles D B C, A C B; D B is equal to A C; and B C common to both; the two sides D B, B C, are equal to the two A C, C B, each to each, and the angle D B C is equal to the angle A C B: therefore, the base D C is equal to the base A B, and the triangle D B C (Mr. Southey) is equal to the triangle A C B, the less to the greater, which is absurd\" etc.\n\nThe editor of the 'Edinburgh Register' will find the rest of the theorem hard by his stabling; he has only to cross the river; 'tis the first turnpike t' other side 'Pons Asinorum.'[A]\n\n['The Curse of Kehama', by Robert Southey, was published 1810;\n'Arthur, or The Northern Enchantment', by the Rev.

Burdett 'v.' William Scott ('vide supra'), which was brought before Lord Meadowbank as ordinary in the outer court. Jeffrey was counsel for the pursuer, who sought to recover a sum of \u00a35000 lent under a bond. For the defence it was alleged that the money had been entrusted for a particular purpose, namely, the maintenance of an infant. Jeffrey denied the existence of any such claim, and maintained that whatever was scandalous or calumnious in the defence was absolutely untrue. The case, which was not included in the Scottish Law Reports, was probably settled out of court. Evidently the judge held that on technical grounds an action did not lie. Burdett's enemies were not slow in turning the scandal to account. (See a contemporary pamphlet, 'Adultery and Patriotism', London, 1811.)] ]\n\n[Sub-Footnote A: This Latin has sorely puzzled the University of\nEdinburgh. Ballantyne said it meant the \"Bridge of Berwick,\" but\nSouthey claimed it as half English; Scott swore it was the \"Brig o'\nStirling:\" he had just passed two King James's and a dozen Douglasses\nover it. At last it was decided by Jeffrey, that it meant nothing more\nnor less than the \"counter of Archy Constable's shop.\"]\n[Footnote 62: Voltaire's 'Pucelle' is not quite so immaculate as Mr. Southey's 'Joan of Arc', and yet I am afraid the Frenchman has both more truth and poetry too on his side\u2014(they rarely go together)\u2014than our patriotic minstrel, whose first essay was in praise of a fanatical French strumpet, whose title of witch would be correct with the change of the first letter.]\n\n[Footnote 63: Like Sir Bland Burges's 'Richard'; the tenth book of which I read at Malta, on a trunk of Eyre's, 19, Cockspur-street.

Elizabeth Noel, daughter of Lord Wentworth, and younger sister of Byron's mother-in-law, Lady Milbanke. He was called to the bar in 1777, and in the same year was appointed a Commissioner in Bankruptcy. In 1787 he was returned M.P. for the borough of Helleston; and from 1789 to 1795 held office as Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. In 1795, at the instance of his chief, Lord Grenville, he vacated his post, and by way of compensation was created a baronet with a sinecure post as Knight-Marshal of the Royal Household. Thenceforth he devoted himself to literature. In 1796 he wrote the 'Birth and Triumph of Love', by way of letter-press to some elegant designs of the Princess Elizabeth. (For 'Richard the First' and the 'Exodiad', see note, p. 436.) His plays, 'Riches and Tricks for Travellers', appeared in 1810, and there were other works. In spite of Wordsworth's testimony (Wordsworth signed, but Coleridge dictated and no doubt composed, the letter: see 'Thomas Poole and His Friends', ii. 27) \"to a pure and unmixed vein of native English\" in 'Richard the First (Bland-Burges Papers', 1885, p. 308), Burges as a poet awaits rediscovery.

Nathaniel Bloomfield and his brother Bobby have set all Somersetshire singing; nor has the malady confined itself to one county. Pratt too (who once was wiser) has caught the contagion of patronage, and decoyed a poor fellow named Blackett into poetry; but he died during the operation, leaving one child and two volumes of \"Remains\" utterly destitute. The girl, if she don't take a poetical twist, and come forth as a shoemaking Sappho, may do well; but the \"tragedies\" are as ricketty as if they had been the offspring of an Earl or a Seatonian prize poet. The patrons of this poor lad are certainly answerable for his end; and it ought to be an indictable offence. But this is the least they have done: for, by a refinement of barbarity, they have made the (late) man posthumously ridiculous, by printing what he would have had sense enough never to print himself. Certes these rakers of \"Remains\" come under the statute against \"resurrection men.\" What does it signify whether a poor dear dead dunce is to be stuck up in Surgeons' or in Stationers' Hall? Is it so bad to unearth his bones as his blunders? Is it not better to gibbet his body on a heath, than his soul in an octavo? \"We know what we are, but we know not what we may be;\" and it is to be hoped we never shall know, if a man who has passed through life with a sort of \u00e9clat is to find himself a mountebank on the other side of Styx, and made, like poor Joe Blackett, the laughing-stock of purgatory. The plea of publication is to provide for the child; now, might not some of this 'Sutor ultra Crepidaitis' friends and seducers have done a decent action without inveigling Pratt into biography? And then his inscription split into so many modicums!\u2014\"To the Duchess of Somuch, the Right Hon.

the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside borne to the\nHospital,\nThe meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,\nThe excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly\nWorking his passage to the centre of the crowd,\nThe impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,\nWhat groans of over-fed or half-starv'd who fall sunstruck or\nIn fits,\nWhat exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry\nHome and give birth to babes,\n\nWhat living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what\nhowls restrain'd by decorum,\nArrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made,\nacceptances, rejections with convex lips,\nI mind them or the show or resonance of them \u2014 I come and I\ndepart.\n\n9\n\nThe big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,\nThe dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn\nwagon,\nThe clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,\nThe armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.\nI am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the load,\nI felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,\nI jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and\ntimothy,\nAnd roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.\n\n10\n\nAlone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,\nWandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,\nIn the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,\nKindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd game,\nFalling asleep on the gather'd leaves with my dog and gun by my side.\n\nThe Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle\nand scud,\nMy eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously\nfrom the deck.\n\nThe boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,\nI tuck'd my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;\nYou should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.\n\nI saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far\nwest, the bride was a red girl,\nHer father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders,\nOn a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,\nShe had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach'd to her feet.\n\nThe runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,\nI heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,\nThrough the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,\nAnd went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,\nAnd brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and\nbruis'd feet,\nAnd gave him a room that enter'd from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,\nAnd remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,\nAnd remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\nHe staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass'd north,\nI had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean'd in the corner.\n\n11\n\nTwenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,\nTwenty-eight young men and all so friendly;\nTwenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.\nShe owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,\nShe hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the\nwindow.\nWhich of the young men does she like the best?\nAh the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.\n\nWhere are you off to, lady? for I see you,\nYou splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.\n\nDancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,\nThe rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.\n\nThe beards of the young men glisten'd with wet, it ran from\ntheir long hair,\nLittle streams pass'd all over their bodies.\n\nAn unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies,\nIt descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\n\nThe young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge\nto the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,\nThey do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and\nbending arch,\nThey do not think whom they souse with spray.\n\n12\n\nThe butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his\nknife at the stall in the market,\nI loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.\n\nBlacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,\nEach has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great\nheat in the fire.\n\nFrom the cinder-strew'd threshold I follow their movements,\nThe lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive\narms,\nOverhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,\nThey do not hasten, each man hits in his place.\n\n13\n\nThe negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block\nSwags underneath on its tied-over chain,\nThe negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady\nAnd tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the string-piece,\nHis blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens\nOver his hip-band,\nHis glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of\nHis hat away from his forehead,\nThe sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the\nBlack of his polish'd and perfect limbs.\n\nI behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not\nStop there,\nI go with the team also.\n\nIn me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well\nAs forward sluing,\nTo niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object\nMissing,\nAbsorbing all to myself and for this song.\n\nOxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade,\nWhat is that you express in your eyes?\nIt seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\n\nMy tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my\nDistant and day-long ramble,\nThey rise together, they slowly circle around.\n\nI believe in those wing'd purposes,\nAnd acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,\nAnd consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,\nAnd do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not\nSomething else,\nAnd the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills\nPretty well to me,\nAnd the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.\n\n14\n\nThe wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,\nYa-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,\nThe pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,\nFind its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.\n\nThe sharp-hoof'd moose of the north, the cat on the housesill,\nThe chickadee, the prairie-dog,\nThe litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,\nThe brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread\nWings,\nI see in them and myself the same old law.\n\nThe press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred\nAffections,\nThey scorn the best I can do to relate them.\n\nI am enamour'd of growing out-doors,\nOf men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,\nOf the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes\nAnd mauls, and the drivers of horses,\nI can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.\n\nWhat is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,\nMe going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,\nAdorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take\nMe,\nNot asking the sky to come down to my good will,\nScattering it freely forever.\n\n15\n\nThe pure contralto sings in the organ loft,\nThe carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane\nWhistles its wild ascending lisp,\nThe married and unmarried children ride home to their\nThanksgiving dinner,\nThe pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong\nArm,\nThe mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon\nAre ready,\n\nThe duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,\nThe deacons are ordain'd with cross'd hands at the altar,\nThe spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big\nWheel,\nThe farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe\nAnd looks at the oats and rye,\nThe lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm'd case,\n(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his\nMother's bedroom;)\nThe jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his\nCase,\nHe turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the\nManuscript;\nThe malform'd limbs are tied to the surgeon's table,\nWhat is removed drops horribly in a pail;\nThe quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard\nNods by the bar-room stove,\nThe machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his\nBeat, the gate-keeper marks who pass,\nThe young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him,\nThough I do not know him;)\nThe half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,\nThe western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean\nOn their rifles, some sit on logs,\nOut from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position,\nLevels his piece;\nThe groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,\nAs the woolly-pates ho in the sugar-field, the overseer views\nThem from his saddle,\nThe bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their\nPartners, the dancers bow to each other,\nThe youth lies awake in the cedar-roof'd garret and harks to\nThe musical rain,\nThe Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,\nThe squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm'd cloth is offering\nMoccasins and bead-bags for sale,\nThe connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with\nHalf-shut eyes bent sideways,\n\nAs the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is\nThrown for the shore-going passengers,\nThe young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister\nWinds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the\nKnots,\nThe one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago\nBorne her first child,\nThe clean-hair'd Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine\nOr in the factory or mill,\nThe paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the\nReporter's lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the signpainter\nIs lettering with blue and gold,\nThe canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts\nAt his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,\nThe conductor beats time for the band and all the performers\nFollow him,\nThe child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,\nThe regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the\nWhite sails sparkle!)\nThe drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray,\nThe pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser\nHiggling about the odd cent;)\nThe bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the\nClock moves slowly,\nThe opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open'd lips,\nThe prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her\nTipsy and pimpled neck,\nThe crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and\nWink to each other,\n(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)\nThe President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the\nGreat Secretaries,\nOn the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with\nTwined arms,\nThe crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in\nThe hold,\nThe Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his\nCattle,\n\nAs the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by\nThe jingling of loose change,\nThe floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the\nRoof, the masons are calling for mortar,\nIn single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the\nLaborers;\nSeasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is\nGather'd, it is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes\nOf cannon and small arms!)\nSeasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the\nMower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground;\nOff on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole\nIn the frozen surface,\nThe stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter\nStrikes deep with his axe,\nFlatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood\nOr pecan-trees,\nCoon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through\nThose drain'd by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas,\nTorches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or\nAltamahaw,\nPatriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and\nGreat-grandsons around them,\nIn walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers\nAfter their day's sport,\nThe city sleeps and the country sleeps,\nThe living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,\nThe old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband\nSleeps by his wife;\nAnd these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,\nAnd such as it is to be of these more or less I am,\nAnd of these one and all I weave the song of myself.\n\n16\n\nI am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,\nRegardless of others, ever regardful of others,\nMaternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,\nStuff'd with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with the stuff\nThat is fine,\nOne of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same\nAnd the largest the same,\nA Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant\nAnd hospitable down by the Oconee I live,\nA Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the\nLimberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,\nA Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin\nLeggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,\nA boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier,\nBadger, Buck-eye;\nAt home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with\nFishermen off Newfoundland,\nAt home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and\nTacking,\nAt home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine,\nOr the Texan ranch,\nComrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners,\n(loving their big proportions,)\nComrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake\nHands and welcome to drink and meat,\nA learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,\nA novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,\nOf every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,\nA farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,\nPrisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.\nI resist any thing better than my own diversity,\nBreathe the air but leave plenty after me,\nAnd am not stuck up, and am in my place.\n(The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place,\nThe bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in\nTheir place,\nThe palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)\n\n17\n\nThese are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands,\nThey are not original with me,\nIf they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or\nNext to nothing,\nIf they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they\nAre nothing,\nIf they are not just as close as they are distant they are\nNothing.\nThis is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the\nWater is,\nThis the common air that bathes the globe.\n18\nWith music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,\nI play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches\nFor conquer'd and slain persons.\nHave you heard that it was good to gain the day?\nI also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in\nWhich they are won.\nI beat and pound for the dead,\nI blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for\nThem.\nVivas to those who have fail'd!\nAnd to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!\nAnd to those themselves who sank in the sea!\nAnd to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome\nHeroes!\nAnd the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest\nHeroes known!\n\n19\n\nThis is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,\nIt is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, I make\nAppointments with all,\nI will not have a single person slighted or left away,\nThe kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,\nThe heavy-lipp'd slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;\nThere shall be no difference between them and the rest.\nThis is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of\nHair,\n\nThis the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,\nThis the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,\nThis the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.\n\nDo you guess I have some intricate purpose?\nWell I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica\nOn the side of a rock has.\nDo you take it I would astonish?\nDoes the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering\nThrough the woods?\nDo I astonish more than they?\nThis hour I tell things in confidence,\nI might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.\n\n20\n\nWho goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;\nHow is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?\nWhat is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?\nAll I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,\nElse it were time lost listening to me.\nI do not snivel that snivel the world over,\nThat months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.\nWhimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids,\nConformity goes to the fourth-remov'd,\nI wear my hat as I please indoors or out.\nWhy should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?\nHaving pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel'd\nWith doctors and calculated close,\nI find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.\nIn all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,\nAnd the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.\nI know I am solid and sound,\nTo me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,\nAll are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.\nI know I am deathless,\nI know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,\nI know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt\nStick at night.\n\nI know I am august,\nI do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,\nI see that the elementary laws never apologize,\n(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house\nBy, after all.)\n\nI exist as I am, that is enough,\nIf no other in the world be aware I sit content,\nAnd if each and all be aware I sit content.\n\nOne world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is\nMyself,\nAnd whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or\nTen million years,\nI can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can\nWait.\n\nMy foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite,\nI laugh at what you call dissolution,\nAnd I know the amplitude of time.\n\n21\n\nI am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,\nThe pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are\nWith me,\nThe first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I\nTranslate into a new tongue.\nI am the poet of the woman the same as the man,\nAnd I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,\nAnd I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.\n\nI chant the chant of dilation or pride,\nWe have had ducking and deprecating about enough,\nI show that size is only development.\n\nHave you outstript the rest? are you the President?\nIt is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and\nStill pass on.\n\nI am he that walks with the tender and growing night,\nI call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.\n\nPress close bare-bosom'd night \u2014 press close magnetic\nNourishing night!\nNight of south winds \u2014 night of the large few stars!\nStill nodding night \u2014 mad naked summer night.\n\nSmile O voluptuous cool-breath'd earth!\nEarth of the slumbering and liquid trees!\nEarth of departed sunset \u2014 earth of the mountains misty-topt!\nEarth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!\nEarth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!\nEarth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!\nFar-swooping elbow'd earth \u2014 rich apple-blossom'd earth!\nSmile, for your lover comes.\n\nProdigal, you have given me love \u2014 therefore I to you give\nLove!\nO unspeakable passionate love.\n\n22\n\nYou sea! I resign myself to you also \u2014 I guess what you mean,\nI behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers,\nI believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,\nWe must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of\nSight of the land,\nCushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,\nDash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.\n\nSea of stretch'd ground-swells,\nSea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,\nSea of the brine of life and of unshovell'd yet always-ready\nGraves,\nHowler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,\nI am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.\n\nPartaker of influx and efflux, I, extoller of hate and conciliation,\nExtoller of amies and those that sleep in each others' arms.\n\nI am he attesting sympathy,\n(Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house\nThat supports them?)\nI am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the\nPoet of wickedness also.\n\nWhat blurt is this about virtue and about vice?\nEvil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand\nIndifferent,\nMy gait is no fault-finder's or rejecter's gait,\nI moisten the roots of all that has grown.\n\nDid you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?\nDid you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work'd over and\nRectified?\n\nI find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance,\nSoft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,\nThoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.\n\nThis minute that comes to me over the past decillions,\nThere is no better than it and now.\n\nWhat behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not\nSuch a wonder,\nThe wonder is always and always how there can be a mean\nMan or an infidel.\n\n23\n\nEndless unfolding of words of ages!\nAnd mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.\n\nA word of the faith that never balks,\nHere or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time\nAbsolutely.\n\nIt alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,\nThat mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.\n\nI accept Reality and dare not question it,\nMaterialism first and last imbuing.\n\nHurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!\nFetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,\nThis is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a\nGrammar of the old cartouches,\nThese mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown\nSeas,\nThis is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a\nMathematician.\n\nGentlemen, to you the first honors always!\nYour facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,\nI but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.\n\nLess the reminders of properties told my words,\nAnd more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,\nAnd make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor\nmen and women fully equipt,\nAnd beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire.\n\n24\n\nWalt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,\nTurbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding.\n\nNo sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,\nNo more modest than immodest.\n\nUnscrew the locks from the doors!\nUnscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!\n\nWhoever degrades another degrades me,\nAnd whatever is done or said returns at last to me.\n\nThrough me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the\ncurrent and index.\nI speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,\nBy God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.\n\nThrough me many long dumb voices,\nVoices of the interminable generation of prisoners and slaves,\nVoices of the diseas'd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,\nVoices of cycles of preparation and accretion,\nAnd of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff,\nAnd of the rights of them the others are down upon,\nOf the deform'd, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,\nFog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.\n\nThrough me forbidden voices,\nVoices of sexes and lusts, voices veil'd and I remove the veil,\nVoices indecent by me clarified and transfigur'd.\n\nI do not press my fingers across my mouth,\nI keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,\nCopulation is no more rank to me than death is.\n\nI believe in the flesh and the appetites,\nSeeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.\n\nDivine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch'd from,\nThe scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,\nThis head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.\n\nIf I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it,\nTranslucent mould of me it shall be you!\nShaded ledges and rests it shall be you!\nFirm masculine colter it shall be you!\nWhatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!\nYou my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!\nBreast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!\nMy brain it shall be your occult convolutions!\nRoot of wash'd sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!\nMix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!\nTrickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!\nSun so generous it shall be you!\nVapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!\nYou sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!\nWinds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!\nBroad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you!\nHands I have taken, face I have kiss'd, mortal I have ever touch'd, it shall be you.\n\nI dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,\nEach moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,\nI cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of\nMy faintest wish,\nNor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the\nFriendship I take again.\n\nThat I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,\nA morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the\nMetaphysics of books.\n\nTo behold the day-break!\nThe little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,\nThe air tastes good to my palate.\n\nHefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising,\nFreshly exuding,\nScooting obliquely high and low.\n\nSomething I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,\nSeas of bright juice suffuse heaven.\n\nThe earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,\nThe heav'd challenge from the east that moment over my head,\nThe mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!\n\n25\n\nDazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill\nMe,\nIf I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.\nWe also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,\nWe found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the\nDay-break.\nMy voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,\nWith the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes\nOf worlds.\nSpeech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,\nIt provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,\nWalt you contain enough, why don't you let it out then?\nCome now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of\nArticulation,\nDo you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are\nFolded?\nWaiting in gloom, protected by frost,\nThe dirt receding before my prophetical screams,\nI underlying causes to balance them at last,\n\nMy knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the\nMeaning of all things,\nHappiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in\nSearch of this day.)\nMy final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I\nReally am,\nEncompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,\nI crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward\nYou.\nWriting and talk do not prove me,\nI carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,\nWith the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.\n\n26\n\nNow I will do nothing but listen,\nTo accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute\nToward it.\n\nI hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of\nFlames, clack of sticks cooking my meals.\nI hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,\nI hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or\nFollowing,\nSounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the\nDay and night,\nTalkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh\nOf work-people at their meals,\nThe angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the\nSick,\nThe judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips\nPronouncing a death-sentence,\nThe heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves,\nThe refrain of the anchor-lifters,\nThe ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of\nSwift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory\nTinkles and color'd lights,\nThe steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching\nCars,\n\nThe slow march play'd at the head of the association marching\nTwo and two,\n(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with\nBlack muslin.)\n\nI hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's complaint,)\nI hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,\nIt shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.\n\nI hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,\nAh this indeed is music \u2014 this suits me.\n\nA tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,\nThe orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.\n\nI hear the train'd soprano (what work with hers is this?)\nThe orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,\nIt wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess'd\nThem,\nIt sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick'd by the indolent\nWaves,\nI am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,\nSteep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throttled in\nFakes of death,\nAt length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,\nAnd that we call Being.\n\n27\n\nTo be in any form, what is that?\n(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back\nThither,)\nIf nothing lay more develop'd the quahaug in its callous shell\nWere enough.\n\nMine is no callous shell,\nI have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,\nThey seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.\n\nI merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,\nTo touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I\nCan stand.\n\n28\n\nIs this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,\nFlames and ether making a rush for my veins,\nTreacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,\nMy flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is\nHardly different from myself,\nOn all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,\nStraining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,\nBehaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,\nDepriving me of my best as for a purpose,\nUnbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,\nDeluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and\nPasture-fields,\nImmodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,\nThey bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the\nEdges of me,\nNo consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my\nAnger,\nFetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,\nThen all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.\n\nThe sentries desert every other part of me,\nThey have left me helpless to a red marauder,\nThey all come to the headland to witness and assist against\nMe.\n\nI am given up by traitors,\nI talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the\nGreatest traitor,\nI went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me\nThere.\n\nYou villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in\nIts throat,\nUnclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.\n\n29\n\nBlind loving wrestling touch, sheath'd hooded sharp-tooth'd\nTouch!\nDid it make you ache so, leaving me?\n\nParting track'd by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual\nLoan,\nRich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.\n\nSprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and\nVital,\nLandscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.\n\n30\n\nAll truths wait in all things,\nThey neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,\nThey do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,\nThe insignificant is as big to me as any,\n(What is less or more than a touch?)\n\nLogic and sermons never convince,\nThe damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.\n\n(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,\nOnly what nobody denies is so.)\n\nA minute and a drop of me settle my brain,\nI believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,\nAnd a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,\nAnd a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for\nEach other,\nAnd they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it\nBecomes omnific,\nAnd until one and all shall delight us, and we them.\n\n31\n\nI believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of\nThe stars,\nAnd the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and\nThe egg of the wren,\nAnd the tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest,\nAnd the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,\nAnd the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,\n\nAnd the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any\nStatue,\nAnd a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of\nInfidels.\nI find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits,\nGrains, esculent roots,\nAnd am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,\nAnd have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,\nBut call any thing back again when I desire it.\nIn vain the speeding or shyness,\nIn vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my\nApproach,\nIn vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd\nBones,\nIn vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,\nIn vain the ocean setting in hollows and the great monsters\nLying low,\nIn vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,\nIn vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,\nIn vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,\nIn vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to Labrador,\nI follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the\nCliff.\n\n32\n\nI think I could turn and live with animals, they're so placid\nAnd self-contain'd,\nI stand and look at them long and long.\nThey do not sweat and whine about their condition,\nThey do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,\nThey do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,\nNot one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of\nOwning things,\nNot one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands\nOf years ago,\nNot one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\n\nSo they show their relations to me and I accept them,\nThey bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in\nTheir possession.\n\nI wonder where they get those tokens,\nDid I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop\nThem?\n\nMyself moving forward then and now and forever,\nGathering and showing more always and with velocity,\nInfinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,\nNot too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,\nPicking out here one that I love, and now go with him on\nBrotherly terms.\n\nA gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my\nCaresses,\nHead high in the forehead, wide between the ears,\nLimbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,\nEyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly\nMoving.\n\nHis nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,\nHis well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around\nAnd return.\nI but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,\nWhy do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?\nEven as I stand or sit passing faster than you.\n\n33\n\nSpace and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess'd at,\nWhat I guess'd when I loaf'd on the grass,\nWhat I guess'd while I lay alone in my bed,\nAnd again as I walk'd the beach under the paling stars of the\nMorning.\nMy ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,\nI skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,\nI am afoot with my vision.\n\nBy the city's quadrangular houses \u2014 in log huts, camping\nWith lumbermen,\nAlong the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet\nBed,\nWeeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and\nParsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,\nProspecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new\nPurchase,\nScorch'd ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down\nThe shallow river,\nWhere the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where\nThe buck turns furiously at the hunter,\nWhere the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where\nThe otter is feeding on fish,\nWhere the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,\nWhere the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where\nThe beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail;\nOver the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower'd cotton\nPlant, over the rice in its low moist field,\nOver the sharp-peak'd farm house, with its scallop'd scum\nAnd slender shoots from the gutters,\nOver the western persimmon, over the long-leav'd corn, over\nThe delicate blue-flower flax,\nOver the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer\nThere with the rest,\nOver the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the\nBreeze;\nScaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on\nBy low scragged limbs,\nWalking the path worn in the grass and beat through the\nLeaves of the brush,\nWhere the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the\nWheatlot,\nWhere the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great\nGold-bug drops through the dark,\nWhere the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and\nFlows to the meadow,\nWhere cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous\nShuddering of their hides,\n\nWhere the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons\nStraddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons\nFrom the rafters;\nWhere trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its\nCylinders,\nWhere the human heart beats with terrible throes under its\nRibs,\nWhere the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in\nIt myself and looking composedly down,)\nWhere the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat\nHatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,\nWhere the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,\nWhere the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,\nWhere the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,\nWhere the half-burn'd brig is riding on unknown currents,\nWhere shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are\nCorrupting below;\nWhere the dense-starr'd flag is borne at the head of the\nRegiments,\nApproaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,\nUnder Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my\nCountenance,\nUpon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood\nOutside,\nUpon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good\nGame of base-ball,\nAt he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license,\nBull-dances, drinking, laughter,\nAt the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash,\nSucking the juice through a straw,\nAt apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,\nAt musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings,\nHouse-raisings;\nWhere the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles,\nScreams, weeps,\nWhere the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks\nAre scatter'd, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,\n\nWhere the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the\nStud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,\nWhere the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with\nShort jerks,\nWhere sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and\nLonesome prairie,\nWhere herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square\nMiles far and near,\nWhere the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the\nLong-lived swan is curving and winding,\nWhere the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs\nHer near-human laugh,\nWhere bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid\nBy the high weeds,\nWhere band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground\nWith their heads out,\nWhere burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a cemetery,\nWhere winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled\nTrees,\nWhere the yellow-crown'd heron comes to the edge of the\nMarsh at night and feeds upon small crabs,\nWhere the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm\nNoon,\nWhere the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the\nWalnut-tree over the wall,\nThrough patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired\nLeaves,\nThrough the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,\nThrough the gymnasium, through the curtain'd saloon,\nThrough the office or public hall;\nPleas'd with the native and pleas'd with the foreign, pleas'd\nWith the new and old,\nPleas'd with the homely woman as well as the handsome,\nPleas'd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and\nTalks melodiously,\nPleas'd with the tune of the choir of the whitewash'd church,\nPleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist\npreacher, impress'd seriously at the camp-meeting;\nLooking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole\nforenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,\n\nWandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up to the\nClouds, or down a lane or along the beach,\nMy right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I\nIn the middle;\nComing home with the silent and dark-cheek'd bush-boy,\n(behind me he rides at the drape of the day,)\nFar from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet,\nOr the moccasin print,\nBy the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish\nPatient,\nNigh the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a\nCandle;\nVoyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,\nHurrying with the modern crowd as eager and flickle as any,\nHot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,\nSolitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from\nMe a long while,\nWalking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God\nBy my side,\nSpeeding through space, speeding through heaven and the\nStars,\nSpeeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and\nThe diameter of eighty thousand miles,\nSpeeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,\nCarrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in\nIts belly,\nStorming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\nBacking and filling, appearing and disappearing,\nI tread day and night such roads.\n\nI visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,\nAnd look at quintillions ripen'd and look at quintillions green.\n\nI fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,\nMy course runs below the soundings of plummets.\n\nI help myself to material and immaterial,\nNo guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.\n\nI anchor my ship for a little while only,\nMy messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns\nTo me.\n\nI go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a\nPike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\n\nI ascend to the foretruck,\nI take my place late at night in the crow's-nest,\nWe sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,\nThrough the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the\nWonderful beauty,\nThe enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the\nScenery is plain in all directions,\nThe white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out\nMy fancies toward them,\nWe are approaching some great battle-field in which we are\nSoon to be engaged,\nWe pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass\nWith still feet and caution,\nOr we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin'd city,\nThe blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living\nCities of the globe.\n\nI am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,\nI turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride\nMyself,\nI tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\n\nMy voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,\nThey fetch my man's body up dripping and drown'd.\n\nI understand the large hearts of heroes,\nThe courage of present times and all times,\nHow the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of\nThe steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,\nHow he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful\nOf days and faithful of nights,\nAnd chalk'd in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we\nWill not desert you;\n\nHow he follow'd with them and tack'd with them three days\nAnd would not give it up,\nHow he saved the drifting company at last,\nHow the lank loose-gown'd women look'd when boated\nFrom the side of their prepared graves,\nHow the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the\nSharp-lipp'd unshaved men;\nAll this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,\nI am the man, I suffer'd, I was there.\n\nThe disdain and calmness of martyrs,\nThe mother of old, condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry\nWood, her children gazing on,\nThe hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,\nBlowing, cover'd with sweat,\nThe twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the\nMurderous buckshot and the bullets,\nAll these I feel or am.\n\nI am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\nHell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the\nMarksmen,\nI clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the\nOoze of my skin,\nI fall on the weeds and stones,\nThe riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\nTaunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with\nWhip-stocks.\n\nAgonies are one of my changes of garments,\nI do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself\nBecome the wounded person,\nMy hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\n\nI am the mash'd fireman with breast-bone broken,\nTumbling walls buried me in their debris,\nHeat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my\nComrades,\nI heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,\nThey have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly life me forth.\n\nI lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for\nMy sake,\nPainless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,\nWhite and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are\nBared of their fire-caps,\nThe kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\n\nDistant and dead resuscitate,\nThey show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the\nClock myself.\n\nI am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort's bombardment,\nI am there again.\n\nAgain the long roll of the drummers,\nAgain the attacking cannon, mortars,\nAgain to my listeing ears the cannon responsive.\n\nI take part, I see and hear the whole,\nThe cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd shots,\nThe ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,\nWorkmen searching after damages, making indispensable\nRepairs,\nThe fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped\nExplosion,\nThe whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\n\nAgain gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously\nWaves with his hand,\nHe gasps through the clot Mind not me \u2014 mind\n\u2014 the entrenchments.\n\n34\n\nNow I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,\n(I tell not the fall of Alamo,\nNot one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\nThe hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)\n'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and\nTwelve young men.\nRetreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their\nBaggage for breastworks,\nNine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's, nine\nTimes their number, was the price they took in advance,\nTheir colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,\nThey treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing\nAnd seal, gave up their arms and march'd back prisoners\nOf war.\nThey were the glory of the race of rangers,\nMatchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\nLarge, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and\nAffectionate,\nBearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\nNot a single one over thirty years of age.\nThe second First-day morning they were brought out in\nSquads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer,\nThe work commenced about five o'clock and was over by\nEight.\nNone obey'd the command to kneel,\nSome made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and\nStraight,\nA few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and\nDead lay together,\nThe maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw\nThem there,\nSome half-kill'd attempted to crawl away,\nThese were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the\nBlunts of muskets.\nA youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two\nMore came to release him,\nThe three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's blood.\n\nAt eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies;\nThat is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve\nYoung men.\n\n35\n\nWould you hear of an old-time sea-fight?\nWould you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\nList to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it\nTo me.\n\nOur foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)\nHis was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or\nTruer, and never was, and never will be;\nAlong the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us.\n\nWe closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd,\nMy captain lash'd fast with his own hands.\n\nWe had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water,\nOn our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first\nFire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.\n\nFighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,\nTen o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the\nGain, and five feet of water reported,\nThe master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the\nAfter-hold to give them a chance for themselves.\n\nThe transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\nThey see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.\n\nOur frigate takes fire,\nThe other asks if we demand quarter?\nIf our colors are struck and the fighting done?\n\nNow I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\nWe have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun\nOur part of the fighting.\n\nOnly three guns are in use,\nOne is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's\nMain-mast,\nTwo well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry\nAnd clear his decks.\n\nThe tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially\nThe main-top,\nThey hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\n\nNot a moment's cease,\nThe leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the\nPowder-magazine.\n\nOne of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought\nWe are sinking.\n\nSerene stands the little captain,\nHe is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,\nHis eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\n\nToward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender\nTo us.\n\n36\n\nStretch'd and still lies the midnight,\nTwo great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,\nOur vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass\nTo the one we have conquer'd,\nThe captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders\nThrough a countenance white as a sheet,\nNear by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin,\nThe dead face of an old salt with long white hair and\nCarefully curl'd whiskers,\nThe flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and\nBelow,\nThe husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,\nFormless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of\nFlesh upon the masts and spars,\nCut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe\nOf waves,\nBlack and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong\nScent,\nA few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,\nDelicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields\nBy the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,\n\nThe hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,\nWheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and\nLong, dull, tapering groan,\nThese so, these irretrievable.\n\n37\n\nYou laggards there on guard! look to your arms!\nIn at the conquer'd doors they crowd! I am possess'd!\nEmbody all presences outlaw'd or suffering,\nSee myself in prison shaped like another man,\nAnd feel the dull unintermitted pain,\nFor me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and\nKeep watch,\nIt is I let out in the morning and barr'd at night.\n\nNot a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but I am handcuff'd\nTo him and walk by his side,\n(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with\nSweat on my twitching lips.)\n\nNot a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am\nTried and sentenced.\n\nNot a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the\nLast gasp,\nMy face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl, away from me\nPeople retreat.\n\nAskers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in\nThem,\nI project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.\n\n38\n\nEnough! enough! enough!\nSomehow I have been stunn'd. Stand back!\nGive me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers,\nDreams, gaping,\nI discover myself on the verse of a usual mistake.\n\nThat I could forget the mockers and insults!\nThat I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the\nBludgeons and hammers!\nThat I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion\nAnd bloody crowning!\n\nI remember now,\nI resume the overstaid fraction,\nThe grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or\nTo any graves,\nCorpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.\n\nI troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an\nAverage unending procession,\nInland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,\nOur swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,\nThe blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of\nYears.\n\nEleves, I salute you! come forward!\nContinue your annotations, continue your questionings.\n\n39\n\nThe friendly and flowing savage, who is he?\nIs he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?\n\nIs he some Southwesterner rais'd out-doors? is he Kanadian?\nIs he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?\nThe mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?\n\nWherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,\nThey desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them,\nStay with them.\n\nBehavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass,\nUncomb'd head, laughter, and naivet\u00e8,\nSlow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and\nEmanations,\nThey descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,\n\nThey are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly\nOut of the glance of his eyes.\n\n40\n\nFlaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask \u2014 lie over!\nYou light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.\n\nEarth! you seem to look for something at my hands,\nSay, old top-knot, what do you want?\n\nMan or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,\nAnd might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,\nAnd might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and\nDays.\n\nBehold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,\nWhen I give I give myself.\n\nYou there, impotent, loose in the knees,\nOpen your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within you,\nSpread your palms and life the flaps of your pockets,\nI am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to\nSpare,\nAnd any thing I have I bestow.\n\nI do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,\nYou can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold\nYou.\n\nTo cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,\nOn his right cheek I put the family kiss,\nAnd in my soul I swear I never will deny him.\n\nOn women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler\nBabes,\n(This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant\nRepublics.)\n\nTo any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the\nDoor,\n\nTurn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,\nLet the physician and the priest go home.\n\nI seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,\nO despairer, here is my neck,\nBy God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight\nUpon me.\n\nI dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,\nEvery room of the house do I fill with an arm'd force,\nLovers of me, bafflers of graves.\n\nSleep \u2014 I and they keep guard all night,\nNot doubt, not disease shall dare to lay finger upon you,\nI have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,\nAnd when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell\nYou is so.\n\n41\n\nI am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,\nAnd for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.\n\nI heard what was said of the universe,\nHeard it and heard it of several thousand years;\nIt is middling well as far as it goes \u2014 but is that all?\n\nMagnifying and applying come I,\nOutbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,\nTaking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,\nLithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,\nBuying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,\nIn my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the\nCrucifix engraved,\nWith Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and\nImage,\nTaking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,\nAdmitting they were alive and did the work of their days,\n(They bore mites as for unfledg'd birds who have now to rise\nAnd fly and sing for themselves,)\n\nAccepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself,\nBestowing them freely on each man and woman I see,\nDiscovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,\nPutting higher claims for him there with his roll'd-up sleeves\nDriving the mallet and chisel,\nNot objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of\nSmoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious\nAs any revelation,\nLads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less\nTo me than the gods of the antique wars,\nMinding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,\nTheir brawny limbs passing safe over charr'd laths, their\nWhite foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;\nBy the mechanic's wife with her babe at her nipple\nInterceding for every person born,\nThree scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty\nAngels with shirts bagg'd out at their waists,\nThe snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past\nAnd to come,\nSelling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for\nHis brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery;\nWhat was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod\nAbout me, and not filling the square rod then,\nThe bull and the bug never worshipp'd half enough,\nDung and dirt more admirable than was dream'd,\nThe supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to\nBe one of the supremes,\nThe day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good\nAs the best, and be as prodigious;\nBy my life-lumps! becoming already a creator,\nPutting myself here and now to the ambush'd womb of the\nShadows.\n\n42\n\nA call in the midst of the crowd,\nMy own voice, orotund sweeping and final.\n\nCome my children,\nCome my boys and girls, my women, household and\nIntimates,\n\nNow the performer launches his nerve, he has pass'd his\nPrelude on the reeds within.\n\nEasily written loose-finger'd chords \u2014 I feel the thrum of your\nClimax and close.\n\nMy head slues round on my neck,\nMusic rolls, but not from the organ,\nFolks are around me, but they are no household of mine.\n\nEver the hard unsunk ground,\nEver the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward\nSun, ever the air and the ceaseless tides,\nEver myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,\nEver the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn'd thumb,\nThat breath of itches and thirsts,\nEver the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one\nHides and bring him forth,\nEver love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,\nEver the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.\n\nHere and there with dimes on the eyes walking,\nTo feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,\nTickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once\nGoing,\nMany sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for\nPayment receiving,\nA few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.\n\nThis is the city and I am one of the citizens,\nWhatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars,\nMarkets, newspapers, schools,\nThe mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories,\nStocks, stores, real estate and personal estate.\n\nThe little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and\nTail'd coats,\nI am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or\nFleas,)\nI acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and\nShallowest is deathless with me,\n\nWhat I do and say the same waits for them,\nEvery thought that flounders in me the same flounders in\nThem.\n\nI know perfectly well my own egotism,\nKnow my omnivorous lines and must not write any less,\nAnd would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.\n\nNot words of routine this song of mine,\nBut abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;\nThis printed and bound book \u2014 but the printer and the\nPrinting-office boy?\nThe well-taken photographs \u2014 but your wife or friend close\nAnd solid in your arms?\nThe black ship mail'd with iron, her mighty guns in her\nTurrets \u2014 but the pluck of the captain and engineers?\nIn the houses the dishes and fare and furniture \u2014 but the host\nAnd hostess, and the look out of their eyes?\nThe sky up there \u2014 yet here or next door, or across the way?\nThe saints and sages in history \u2014 but you yourself?\nSermons, creeds, theology \u2014 but the fathomless human brain,\nAnd what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?\n\n43\n\nI do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,\nMy faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,\nEnclosing worship ancient and modern and all between\nAncient and modern,\nBelieving I shall come again upon the earth after five\nThousand years,\nWaiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting\nThe sun,\nMaking a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with\nSticks in the circle of obis,\nHelping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,\nDancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt\nAnd austere in the woods a gymnosophist,\nDrinking mead from the skull-cup, to Shastas and Vedas\nAdmirant, minding the Koran,\n\nWalking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and\nKnife, beating the serpent-skin drum,\nAccepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified,\nKnowing assuredly that he is divine,\nTo the mass kneeling or the puritan's prayer rising, or sitting\nPatiently in a pew,\nRanting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like\nTill my spirit arouses me,\nLooking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement\nAnd land,\nBelonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.\n\nOne of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk\nLike a man leaving charges before a journey.\n\nDown-hearted doubters dull and excluded,\nFrivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd,\nAtheistical,\nI know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt,\nDespair and unbelief.\n\nHow the flukes splash!\nHow they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts\nOf blood!\n\nBe at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,\nI take my place among you as much as among any,\nThe past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,\nAnd what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all\nPrecisely the same.\n\nI do not know what is untried and afterward,\nBut I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.\n\nEach who passes is consider'd, each who stops is consider'd,\nNot a single one can it fail.\n\nIt cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,\nNor the young woman who died and was put by his side,\nNor the little child that peep'd in at the door, and then drew\nBack and was never seen again,\nNor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it\nWith bitterness worse than gall,\nNor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder,\nNor the numberless slaughter'd and wreck'd, nor the brutish\nKoboo call'd the ordure of humanity,\nNor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to\nSlip in,\nNor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of\nThe earth,\nNor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of\nMyriads that inhabit them,\nNor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.\n\n44\n\nIt is time to explain myself \u2014 let us stand up.\nWhat is known I strip away,\nI launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.\n\nThe clock indicates the moment \u2014 but what does eternity\nIndicate?\n\nWe have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,\nThere are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.\nBirths have brought us richness and variety,\nAnd other births will bring us richness and variety.\n\nI do not call one greater and one smaller,\nThat which fills its period and place is equal to any.\nWere mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother,\nMy sister?\nI am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,\nAll has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,\n(What have I to do with lamentation?)\nI am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I an encloser of\nThings to be.\n\nMy feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,\nOn every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between\nThe steps,\nAll below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.\n\nRise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,\nAfar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even\nThere,\nI waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic\nMist,\nAnd took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.\n\nLong I was hugg'd close \u2014 long and long.\n\nImmense have been the preparations for me,\nFaithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.\n\nCycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful\nBoatmen,\nFor room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,\nThey sent influences to look after what was to hold me.\n\nBefore I was born out of my mother generations guided me,\nMy embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.\n\nFor it the nebula cohered to an orb,\nThe long slow strata piled to rest it on,\nVast vegetables gave it sustenance,\nMonstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited\nIt with care.\n\nAll forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight me,\nNow on this spot I stand with my robust soul.\n\n45\n\nO span of youth! ever-push'd elasticity!\nO manhood, balanced, florid and full.\n\nMy lovers suffocate me,\nCrowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,\nJostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to\nMe at night,\nCrying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging\nAnd chirping over my head,\nCalling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,\nLighting on every moment of my life,\nBussing my body with soft balsamic busses,\nNoiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving\nThem to be mine.\n\nOld age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying\nDays!\n\nEvery condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what\nGrows after and out of itself,\nAnd the dark hush promulges as much as any.\n\nI open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,\nAnd all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the\nRim of the farther systems.\n\nWider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,\nOutward and outward and forever outward.\n\nMy sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,\nHe joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,\nAnd greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside\nThem.\n\nThere is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,\nIf I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces,\nWere this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would\nNot avail in the long run,\nWe should surely bring up again where we now stand,\nAnd surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.\n\nA few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues,\nDo not hazard the span or make it impatient,\nThey are but parts, any thing is but a part.\n\nSee ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,\nCount ever so much, there is limitless time around that.\n\nMy rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,\nThe Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,\nThe great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be\nThere.\n\n46\n\nI know I have the best of time and space, and was never\nMeasured and never will be measured.\n\nI tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)\nMy signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut\nFrom the woods,\nNo friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,\nI have no chair, no church, no philosophy,\nI lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,\nBut each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,\nMy left hand hooking you round the waist,\nMy right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the\nPublic road.\n\nNot I, not any one else can travel that road for you,\nYou must travel it for yourself.\n\nIt is not far, it is within reach,\nPerhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not\nKnow,\nPerhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.\n\nShoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us\nHasten forth,\nWonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.\n\nIf you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your\nHand on my hip,\nAnd in due time you shall repay the same service to me,\nFor after we start we never lie by again.\n\nThis day before dawn I ascended a hill and look'd at the\nCrowded heaven,\nAnd I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those\nOrbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in\nThem, shall we be fill'd and satisfied then?\nAnd my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and\nContinue beyond.\n\nYou are also asking me questions and I hear you,\nI answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.\n\nSit a while dear son,\nHere are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,\nBut as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes,\nI kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your\nEgress hence.\n\nLong enough have you dream'd contemptible dreams,\nNow I wash the gum from your eyes,\nYou must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of\nEvery moment of your life.\n\nLong have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,\nNow I will you to be a bold swimmer,\nTo jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me,\nShout, and laughingly dash with your hair.\n\n47\n\nI am the teacher of athletes,\nHe that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves\nThe width of my own,\nHe most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the\nTeacher.\n\nThe boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived\nPower, but in his own right,\nWicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,\nFond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,\nUnrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp\nSteel cuts,\n\nFirst-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a skiff,\nTo sing a song or play on the banjo,\nPreferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with\nSmall-pox over all latherers,\nAnd those well-tann'd to those that keep out of the sun.\n\nI teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?\nI follow you whoever you are from the present hour,\nMy words itch at your ears till you understand them.\n\nI do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time\nWhile I wait for a boat,\n(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of\nYou,\nTied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen'd.)\n\nI swear I will never again mention love or death inside a\nHouse,\nAnd I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or\nHer who privately stays with me in the open air.\n\nIf you would understand me go to the heights or\nWater-shore,\nThe nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of\nWaves a key,\nThe maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.\n\nNo shutter'd room or school can commune with me,\nBut roughs and little children better than they.\n\nThe young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,\nThe woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take\nMe with him all day,\nThe farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound\nOf my voice,\nIn vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and\nSeamen and love them.\n\nThe soldier camp'd or upon the march is mine,\nOn the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do\nNot fail them,\n\nOn that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know\nMe seek me.\n\nMy face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies down alone in\nHis blanket,\nThe driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,\nThe young mother and old mother comprehend me,\nThe girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget\nWhere they are,\nThey and all would resume what I have told them.\n\n48\n\nI have said that the soul is not more than the body,\nAnd I have said that the body is not more than the soul,\nAnd nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,\nAnd whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his\nOwn funeral drest in his shroud,\nAnd I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of\nThe earth,\nAnd to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod\nConfounds the learning of all times,\nAnd there is no trade or employment but the young man\nFollowing it may become a hero,\nAnd there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the\nWheel'd universe,\nAnd I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool\nAnd composed before a million universes.\n\nAnd I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,\nFor I who am curious about each am not curious about\nGod,\n(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about\nGod and about death.)\nI hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God\nNot in the least,\nNor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than\nMyself.\nWhy should I wish to see God better than this day?\nI see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and\nEach moment then,\nIn the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own\nFace in the glass,\nI find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is\nSign'd by God's name,\nAnd I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er\nI go,\nOthers will punctually come for ever and ever.\n\n49\n\nAnd as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is\nIdle to try to alarm me.\n\nTo his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,\nI see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,\nI recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,\nAnd mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.\n\nAnd as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that\nDoes not offend me,\nI smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,\nI reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts of\nMelons.\n\nAnd as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many\nDeaths,\n(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)\n\nI hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,\nO suns \u2014 O grass of graves \u2014 O perpetual transfers and\nPromotions,\nIf you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?\n\nOf the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,\nOf the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing\nTwilight,\nToss, sparkles of day and dusk \u2014 toss on the black stems that\nDecay in the muck,\nToss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.\n\nI ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,\nI perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams\nReflected,\nAnd debouch to the steady and central from the offspring\nGreat or small.\n\n50\n\nThere is that in me \u2014 I do not know what it is \u2014 but I know it\nIs in me.\n\nWrench'd and sweaty \u2014 calm and cool then my body becomes,\nI sleep \u2014 I sleep long.\n\nI do not know it \u2014 it is without name \u2014 it is a word unsaid,\nIt is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.\n\nSomething it swings on more than the earth I swing on,\nTo it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.\n\nPerhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers\nAnd sisters.\n\nDo you see O my brothers and sisters?\nIt is not chaos or death \u2014 it is form, union, plan \u2014 it is eternal\nLife \u2014 it is Happiness.\n\n51\n\nThe past and present wilt \u2014 I have fill'd them, emptied them,\nAnd proceed to fill my next fold of the future.\n\nListener up there! what have you to confide to me?\nLook in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,\n(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a\nMinute longer.)\n\nDo I contradict myself?\nVery well then I contradict myself,\n(I am large, I contain multitudes.)\n\nI concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.\n\nWho has done his day's work? who will soonest be through\nWith his supper?\nWho wishes to walk with me?\n\nWill you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too\nLate?\n\n52\n\nThe spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains\nOf my gab and my loitering.\n\nI too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,\nI sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.\n\nThe last scud of day holds back for me,\nIt flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the\nShadow'd wilds,\nIt coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.\n\nI depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,\nI effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.\n\nI bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,\nIf you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.\n\nYou will hardly know who I am or what I mean,\nBut I shall be good health to you nevertheless,\nAnd filter and fibre your blood.\nFailing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,\nMissing me one place search another,\nI stop somewhere waiting for you.56Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1547235", "artist_names":

level I'm a lucky devil\nTo find a little angel like you!\nA sweet little angel like you\nYou don't play a harp and you haven't got wings\nI knew you've got alot of other heavenly things\nOn the level I'm a lucky devil\nTo find a little angel like you!\nA sweet little angel like you\nMaybe I've got no pitchfork\nMaybe I've got no horns\nBut as long as I've got you baby\nI'm the luckiest devil that ever was born\nNow your love is a treasure and I know what it's worth\n'Cause I'm the only devil that's on heaven on earth\nOn the level I'm a lucky devil\nTo find a little angel like you!\nMaybe I've got no pitchfork\nMaybe I've got no horns\nBut as long as I've got you baby\nI'm the luckiest devil that ever was born\nNow your love is a treasure and I know what it's worth\nI'm the only devil that's on heaven on earth\nOn the level I'm a lucky devil\nTo find a little angel like you!\nA sweet little angel like you\nA sweet little angel like youYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

want you to do\nDon't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost?\nThat's why I'm following you\n\n[Verse 4]\nOn my own\nWould I wander through this wonderland alone\nNever knowing my right foot from my

Martindale", "lyrics": "Deck of Cards LyricsNARRATIVE:\nDuring the North African campaign, a bunch of soldier boys had\nBeen on a long hike and they arrived in a little town called Casino. The\nNext morning being Sunday, several of the boys went to Church. A sergeant\nCommanded the boys in Church and after the Chaplain had read the prayer\nThe text was taken up next. Those of the boys who had a prayer book took\nThem out, but this one boy had only a deck of cards, and so he spread\nThem out. The Sergeant saw the cards and said, \"Soldier, put away those\nCards.\" After the services was over, the soldier was taken prisoner and\nBrought before the Provost Marshall\nThe Marshall said, \"Sergeant, why have you brought this man\nHere?\" \"For playing cards in church, Sir.\" \"And what have you to say for\nYourself, son?\" \"Much, Sir,\" replied the soldier. The Marshall said, \"I\nHope so, for if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever\nPunished.\" The soldier said, \"Sir, I have been on the march for about six\nDays. I have neither a Bible nor a prayer book, but I hope to satisfy\nYou, Sir, with the purity of my intentions.\" And with that, the boy\nStarted his story:\n\n\"You see Sir, when I look at the Ace, it reminds me that there\nIs but one God. And the Deuce reminds me that the Bible is divided into\nTwo parts, the Old and the New Testaments. When I see the Trey, I think\nOf the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. And when I see the Four, I\nThink of the four Evangelists who preached the Gospel; there was Matthew\n\nMark, Luke and John. And when I see the Five, it reminds me of the five\nWise virgins who trimmed their lamps; there were ten of them: five were\nWise and were saved, five were foolish and were shut out. When I see the\nSix, it reminds me that in six days, God made this great heaven and\nEarth. When I see the Seven, it reminds me that on the seventh day, God\nRested from His great work. And when I see the Eight, I think of the\nEight righteous persons God saved when He destroyed this earth; there was\nNoah, his wife, their sons and their wives. And when I see the Nine, I\nThink of the lepers our Savior cleansed, and nine out of the ten didn't\nEven thank Him. When I see the Ten, I think of the Ten Commandments God\nHanded down to Moses on a table of stone. When I see the King, it\nReminds me that there is but one King of Heaven, God Almighty. And when I\nSee the Queen, I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is Queen of\nHeaven. And the Jack or Knave is the Devil. When I count the number\nOf spots on a deck of cards, I find 365, the number of days in a year\nThere are 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year. There are 4 suits, the\nNumber of weeks in a month. There are 12 picture cards, the number of\nMonths in a year. There are 13 tricks, the number of weeks in a quarter\nSo you see, Sir, my pack of cards serves me as a Bible, an Almanac and a\nPrayer Book.\"\nYou might also like\"And friends, the story is true.

this hour of meditation\nGuide him with eternal love.\"\nThere's a village, hidden deep in the valley\nBeneath the mountains high above\nAnd there, twenty years thereafter\nJimmy was to meet his love\n\nAll the chapel bells were ringing\n'Twas a great day in his life\nCause the song that they were singing\nWas for Jimmy and his wife\n\nThen the little congregation\nPrayed for guidance from above\n\"Lead us not into temptation\nBless, O Lord, this celebration\nMay their lives be filled with love.\"\n\nFrom the village, hidden deep in the valley\nOne rainy morning dark and gray\nA soul winged its way to Heaven\nJimmy Brown had passed away\nJust one lonely bell was ringing\nIn the little valley town\n'Twas farewell that it was singing\nTo our dear old Jimmy Brown\nYou might also

wind moans sadly.  From somewhere within the wind\ncomes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters\nsinging \"My Favorite Things.\" A series of sepia images of\nanti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after\nanother on the screen.\n\nIn the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title\nFEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:\nTITLE: \"He who makes a beast of himself Gets rid of the pain\nOf being a man.\"\nDr. Johnson\n\nThe VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe were somewhere around Barstow on\nthe edge of the desert when the\ndrugs began to take hold.\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nA red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black\nscreen.\n\nEXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nTHE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred\nmiles an hour.  THE STONES' \"Sympathy For the Devil\" blares.\n\nAT THE WHEEL\n\nSTRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,\nBEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.\nBESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND\nWRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY\nUNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.\n\nThe music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths\nup a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember saying something like:\n\"I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe\nyou should drive...\"\n\nGONZO starts shaving.\n\n2.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nSuddenly there was a terrible roar\nall around us and the sky was full\nof what looked like huge bats, all\nswooping and screeching and diving\naround the car...\n\nClose on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The\nreflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close\nto one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!\nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\n... and a voice was screaming: Holy\nJesus!  What are these goddamn\nanimals?\n\nCUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -\n\nDUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere.\nGONZO casually looks over...\n\nGONZO\nWhat are you yelling about?\n\nDUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench\nmakes GONZO nick his face with his razor.\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  It's your turn to drive.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNo point mentioning these bats.  I\nthought.  The poor bastard will see\nthem soon enough.\n\nDUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,\nfrantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A\nMOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles\nthrough the impressive stash.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had two bags of grass, seventy-\nfive pellets of mescaline, five\nsheets of high powered blotter\nacid, a salt shaker half full of\ncocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-\ncolored uppers, downers, screamers,\nlaughers... Also a quart of tequila,\na quart of rum, a case of beer, a\npint of raw ether and two dozen\namyls.\n\n3.\n\n\nDUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the\nSHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with\nanother six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives\nback into the car.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNot that we needed all that for the\ntrip, but once you get locked into\na serious drug collection, the\ntendency is to push it as far as\nyou can.\n\nTHE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,\nweakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A\nBAT?\n\nEXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nIN THE RED SHARK\n\nGONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a\nlousy driver.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe only thing that really worried\nme was the ether.  There is nothing\nin the world more helpless and\nirresponsible and depraved than a\nman in the depths of an ether binge.\nAnd I knew we'd get into that\nrotten stuff pretty soon.\n\nThe radio news wars with \"SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL\" on a tape\nrecorder.\n\nRADIO NEWS\nAn overdose of heroin was listed as\nthe official cause of death for\npretty 19 year old Diane Hanby\nwhose body was found stuffed in a\nrefrigerator last week...\n\nGONZO changes the station - \"ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET\nJESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE\" vies with \"SYMPATHY\"... He\nsings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.\nThe RED SHARK fishtails.\n\nGONZO\n\"One toke over the line, sweet\nJesus.\"\n\n4.\n\n\nDUKE\n(muttering to himself)\nOne toke.  You poor fool.  Wait\ntill you see those goddamn bats.\n\nUP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD\n\nA LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a\nthumb.  The RED SHARK roars past.  Then, fifty yards down\nthe road...\n\nGONZO\nLet's give that boy a lift.\n\nGONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side\nof the road.\n\nDUKE\nWe can't stop here - this is bat\ncountry!\n\nGONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.  The\nHITCHHIKER races to the car.  A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.\n\nHITCHHIKER\nHot damn!  I never rode in a\nconvertible before!\n\nThen the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the\nsight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-\nNORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.\n\nDUKE\nIs that right?  Well, I guess\nyou're about ready, eh?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER hesitates.\n\nGONZO\nWe're your friends.  We're not like\nthe others.\n\nDUKE\n(hissing sharply)\nNo more of that talk or I'll put\nthe leeches on you.\n\nDUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.\n\nEXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nThe HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED\nSHARK screams down the road.\n\n5.\n\n\nGONZO sings along to the tape player.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out\nand taking his chances.\n\nDUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear\nview mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHow long could we maintain, I\nwondered.  How long before one of\nus starts raving and jabbering at\nthis boy?  What will he think then?\nThis same lonely desert was the\nlast known home of the Manson family.\n\nThe HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling\ndown GONZO's neck.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWould he make that grim connection\nwhen my attorney starts screaming\nabout bats and huge manta rays\ncoming down on the car?\n\nDUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with\nthe words, sometimes not.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIf so - well, we'll just have to\ncut his head off and bury him\nsomewhere.  Because it goes without\nsaying that we can't turn him loose.\nHe'd report us at once to some kind\nof outback Nazi law enforcement\nagency, and they'll run us down\nlike dogs...\n\nDUKE\n(out loud to himself)\nJesus!  Did I say that?\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOr just think it?  Was I talking?\nDid they hear me?\n\nGONZO\n(reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)\nIt's okay.  He's admiring the shape\nof your skull.\n\nDUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER\ngiggles nervously.\n\n6.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMaybe I better have a chat with\nthis boy I thought.  Perhaps if I\nexplain things, he'll rest easy...\n\nDUKE\n(roaring over the\nroad noise)\nTHERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD\nPROBABLY UNDERSTAND --\n\nThe HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.\n\nDUKE\n(yells)\nCAN YOU HEAR ME?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs\ninto the back seat.\n\nDUKE\nThat's good.  Because I want you to\nhave all the background.  This is a\nvery ominous assignment -- with\novertones of extreme personal\ndanger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism!\nThis is important, goddamnit!  This\nis a true story!...\n(WHACKS the BACK OF\nTHE DRIVER'S SEAT\nwith his fist)\n\n\nThe CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.\n\nGONZO\n(screams)\nKeep your hands off my fucking neck!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS\nHIM BACK DOWN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur vibrations were getting nasty --\nbut why?  Was there no communication\nin this car?  Had we deteriorated\nto the level of dumb beasts?\n\nThe HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.\n\n7.\n\n\nDUKE\n(to HITCHHIKER)\nI want you to understand that this\nman at the wheel is my attorney!\nHe's not just some dingbat I found\non the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I\nthink he's probably Samoan.  But it\ndoesn't matter, does it?  Are you\nprejudiced?\n\nHITCHHIKER\nHell, no!\n\nDUKE\nI didn't think so.  Because in\nspite of his race, this man is\nextremely valuable to me.  Hell, I\nforgot all about this beer.  You\nwant one?\n(HITCHHIKER shakes\nhis head)\nHow about some ether?\n\nHITCHHIKER\nWhat?\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  Let's get right to the\nheart of this thing.  Twenty-four\nhours ago we were sitting in the\nPogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills\nHotel...\n\nINT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY\n\nA uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE\nthrough the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They\nare the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL\nBOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore\nSlings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED\nVERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\n... in the patio section, of\ncourse, drinking Singapore Slings\nwith mescal on the side, hiding\nfrom the brutish realities of this\nfoul year of Our Lord, 1971.\n\nThe DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and\nshades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank\ntop undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious\nconversation.\n\n8.\n\n\nDUKE\nI'm telling you, the Salazar story\nis getting too complicated.  The\nweasels have started closing in.\n\nThe DWARF sneers.\n\nDWARF\nPerhaps this is the call you've\nbeen waiting for all this time,\nsir...\n\nDUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...\n\nDUKE\nUh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...\n\nDUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A\nMOVIE SPY.\n\nDWARF\nThat was headquarters.  They want\nme to go to Las Vegas at once and\nmake contact with a Portuguese\nphotographer named Lacerda.  He'll\nhave the details.  All I have to do\nis check into my sound proof suite\nand he'll seek me out.\n\nGONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!\n\nGONZO\nGod hell!  I think I see the\npattern!  This one sounds like real\ntrouble!  You're going to need\nplenty of legal advice before this\nthing is over.  As your attorney I\nmust advise you that you'll need a\nvery fast car with no top and after\nthat, the cocaine.  And then the\ntape recorder, for special music,\nand some Acapulco shirts...\n(GONZO tucks his\nkhaki undershirt into\nhis white\nbellbottoms -- he\nmeans business!)\nThis blows my weekend, because\nnaturally I'll have to go with\nyou -- and we'll have to arm\nourselves.\n\n9.\n\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  If a thing's worth doing,\nit's worth doing right.\n\nDUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them\nwith the (very large) check in his hand.\n\nThey sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it\nswinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.\n\nDUKE\nI tell you, my man.  This is the\nAmerican Dream in action!  We'd be\nfools not to ride this strange\ntorpedo all the way to the end.\n\nGONZO\nIndeed.  We must do it.  What kind\nof story is this?\n\nEXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY\n\nDUKE and GONZO emerge.\n\nDUKE\nThe Mint 400!  The richest off-road\nrace for motorcycles and dune-\nbuggies in the history of organized\nsport!\n(handing parking\nticket to Valet)\n-- a fantastic spectacle in honor\nof some fatback grossero who owns\nthe luxurious Mint Hotel in the\nheart of downtown Vegas... at least\nthat's what the press release says.\n\nTheir car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.  They\njump in.\n\nDUKE\nWe're going to have to drum it up\non our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.\n\nAnd they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-\nbleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY\n\nThe PINTO races through shot.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nGetting hold of the drugs and\nshirts had been no problem...\n\n10.\n\n\nEXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY\n\nThe PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back\nwindow full of Hawaiian shirts.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\n... but the car and tape recorder\nwere not easy things to round up at\n6:30 on a Friday afternoon in\nHollywood.\n\nINT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY\n\nTORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile\nas GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE.  DUKE carries over four\nSingapore Slings.\n\nGONZO\nO.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it.\nWe'll be there in thirty minutes.\n(to DUKE -- hand over\nthe PHONE)\nI finally located a car with\nadequate horsepower and the proper\ncoloring.\n(into PHONE)\nWhat?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has\na major credit card!  Do you\nrealize who the fuck you're talking\nto?\n\nDUKE\nDon't take any guff from these\nswine.\n(GONZO slams the\nphone down)\nNow we need a sound store with the\nfinest equipment.  Nothing dinky.\nOne of those new Belgian Heliowatts\nwith a voice-activated shotgun\nmike, for picking up conversations\nin oncoming cars.\n\nGONZO\nWe won't make the nut unless we\nhave unlimited credit.\n\nDUKE\nWe will.  You Samoans are all the\nsame.  You have no faith in the\nessential decency of the white\nman's culture.\n\n11.\n\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK\n\nThe PINTO races down street.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe store was closed, but the\nsalesman said he would wait, if we\nhurried...\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK\n\nThey're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.  DUKE\nBANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut we were delayed en route when a\nStingray in front of us killed a\npedestrain.\n\nDirectly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered\ncorpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.\n\nEXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had trouble, again, at the car\nrental agency.\n\nBehind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with\nsatisfaction -- checking it out.  A nervous AGENT holds out\na clipboard.  DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.\n\nAGENT\nSay... uh... you fellas are going\nto be careful with this car, aren't\nyou?\n\nDUKE\nOf course.\n\nDUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the\ngas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.\n\nAGENT\nWell, good god!  You just backed\nover that two foot concrete abutment\nand you didn't even slow down!\nForty-five in reverse!  And you\nbarely missed the pump!\n\nDUKE\nNo harm done.  I always test the\ntransmission that way.  The rear\nend.  For stress factors.\n\n12.\n\n\nGONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box\nof rum and ice into the RED SHARK.\n\nAGENT\nSay.  Are you fellows drinking?\n\nDUKE\nNot me.  We're responsible people.\n\nHe JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.  The\nAGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.\n\nGONZO\nThere's another worrier.  He's\nprobably all cranked up on speed.\n\nEXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nSTRANGE AND MAGICAL.  In the moonlight: the silhouetted\nfigures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe spent the rest of that night\nrounding up materials and packing\nthe car.  Then we ate some mescaline\nand went swimming.\n\nThe surf crashes in the distance...\n\nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT\n\nDUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself\nfloat up through the silvery bubbles...\n\nDUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING\nMOONLIT SURF.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur trip was different.  It was to\nbe a classic affirmation of\neverything right and true in the\nnational character; a gross,\nphysical salute to the fantastic\npossibilities of life in this\ncountry.  But only for those with\ntrue grit...\n\nEXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\n\nDUKE's intense face.\n\nDUKE\n...and we're chock full of that!\n\n13.\n\n\nGONZO\nDamn right!\n\nDUKE\nMy attorney understands this\nconcept, despite his racial handicap.\nBut do you?!\n\nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHe said he understood, but I could\nsee in his eyes that he didn't.

The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL\nBEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy attorney had never been able to\naccept the notion -- often espoused\nby former drug abusers -- that you\ncan get a lot higher without drugs\nthan with them.  And neither have\nI, for that matter.\n\nThe pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL\nLIGHTSHOW PATTERN.

But I spilled the\nrest on the sleeve of my red\nPendleton shirt.\n\nDUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the\ndoor to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in\nslow-motion.\n\nMUSICIAN\nWhat's the trouble?\n\nDUKE\n(also in slow-motion)\nWell, all this white stuff on my\nsleeve is LSD.\n\nThe MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A\nlong pause.\n\nCut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-\ncut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.\nWe cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the\nmen's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...\nsucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The\nSTOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWith a bit of luck his life was\nruined -- forever thinking that\njust behind some narrow door in all\nhis favorite bars, men in red\nPendleton shirts are getting\nincredible kicks from things he'll\nnever know.\n\nINT.

Six?  It\nseems like a lifetime -- the kind\nof peak that never comes again.\nSan Francisco in the middle sixties\nwas a very special time and place\nto be a part of.  But no\nexplanation, no mix of words or\nmusic or memories can touch that\nsense of knowing that you were\nthere and alive in that corner of\ntime and the world.

IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nTHERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION,\nAT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE\nSPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A\nFANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT\nWHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,\nTHAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I\nTHINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE\nOF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE\nFORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY\nMEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T\nNEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY\nprevail.  We had all the momentum;\nwe were riding the crest of a high\nand beautiful wave...\n\nDUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE\nNEVER SEEN BEFORE.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nSo now, less than five years later,\nyou can go up on a steep hill in\nLas Vegas and look west, and with\nthe right kind of eyes you can\nalmost see the high water mark --\nthat place where the wave finally\nbroke and rolled back.\n\n52.\n\n\nThe memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.\nSuddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi\nshouting \"WOODSTOCK \u00dcBER ALLES!\"\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN\n\nA harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking\nlike shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe decision to flee came suddenly.\nOr maybe not.\n\nDUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of\nfruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.\n\nBELL BOY\nRoom service!\n\nThe BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already\nstacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMaybe I'd planned it all along --\nsubconsciously waiting for the\nright moment.  The bill was a\nfactor, I think.  Because I had no\nmoney to pay for it.\n\nDUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur room service tabs had been\nrunning somewhere between $29 and\n$36 per hour, for forty-eight\nconsecutive hours.  Incredible.\nHow could it happen?\n\nDUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED\nLUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room --\nempty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut by the time I asked this\nquestion, there was no one around\nto answer.\n\nDUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.\n\n53.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy attorney was gone.  He must have\nsensed trouble.\n\nQUICK CUT TO:\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY\n\nGONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of\nbrand-new fine cowhide luggage.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nPanic.\n\nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase --\nleaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both\nways, then hurries away down the corridor.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt crept up my spine like first\nrising vibes of an acid frenzy.\nAll these horrible realities began\nto dawn on me.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY\n\nAn anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the\nelevator descends.  He searches his pockets...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nHere I was, alone in Las Vegas,\nwith this goddamned incredibly\nexpensive car, completely twisted\non drugs, no cash, no story for the\nmagazine.  And on top of everything\nelse I had a gigantic goddamn hotel\nbill to deal with.\n\nDUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.\n\nThe door opens.  A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN\nHANDCUFFS.\n\nDUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner.  Doors\nclose.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI didn't even know who had won the\nrace.  Maybe nobody.\n\n54.\n\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\n\nDUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering\nMANAGER.  Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.\n\nDUKE\n(muttering to himself)\nHow would Horatio Alger have\nhandled this situation?\n\nEXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY\n\nMotoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN\nwith a smile.  The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves\nat the CAR BOY.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nStay calm.  Stay calm.  I'm a\nrelatively respectable citizen -- a\nmultiple felon, perhaps, but\ncertainly not dangerous.\n\nThe CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.  DUKE jumps in.  The\nback seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint\n400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.\n\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\nLuckily, I had taken the soap and\ngrapefruit and other luggage out to\nthe car a few hours earlier.  Now\nit was only a matter of slipping\nthe noose...\n\nDUKE shifts into drive.  Deliverance!\n\nCLERK'S VOICE\nMR. DUKE!\n\nDUKE freezes.\n\nCLERK'S VOICE\nMr. Duke!  We've been looking for\nyou!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe game was up!  They had me.\n\nDUKE\n(to himself)\nWell, why not?  Many fine books\nhave been written in prison.\n\n55.\n\n\nResigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.  A young CLERK\narrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS\nHAND.\n\nCLERK\nSir?\n(thrusts out a TELEGRAM)\nThis telegram came for you.\nActually, it isn't for you.  It's\nfor somebody named Thompson, but it\nsays 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does\nthat make sense?\n\nDUKE\n(barely able to speak)\nYes... It makes sense.\n\nDUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.\n\nThe CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous\nstash inside.\n\nCLERK\nI checked the register for this man\nThompson.  We don't show him but I\nfigured he might be part of your\nteam.\n\nDUKE\nHe is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to\nhim.\n\nHe fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.\n\nSECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word\nor two.\n\nCLERK\nWhat confused us was Dr. Gonzo's\nsignature on the telegram from Los\nAngeles.  When we knew he was right\nhere in the hotel.\n\nDUKE\nYou did the right thing.  Never try\nto understand a press message.\nAbout half the time we use codes --\nespecially with Dr. Gonzo.\n\nCLERK\nTell me.  When will the doctor be\nawake?\n\n56.\n\n\nDUKE\n(tenses)\nAwake?  What do you mean?\n\nDUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.\n\nCLERK\n(uncomfortably)\nWell... the manager, Mr. Heem,\nwould like to meet him.  Nothing\nunusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet\nall our large accounts... put them\non a personal basis... just a chat\nand a handshake, you understand.\n\nDUKE\nOf course.  But if I were you, I'd\nleave the Doctor alone until after\nhe's eaten breakfast.  He's a very\ncrude man.\n\nDUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.\n\nCLERK\nBut he will be available?  Perhaps\nlater this morning?\n\nDUKE\nLook.  That telegram was all\nscrambled.  It was actually from\nThompson, not to him.  Western\nUnion must have gotten the names\nreversed.  I have to get going.  I\nhave to get out to the track.\n\nCLERK\nThere's no hurry!  The race is over!\n\nDUKE\n(taking off)\nNot for me.\n\nHe waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.\n\nCLERK\nLet's have lunch!\n\nDUKE\nRighto!\n\nEXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY\n\nDUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.\n\n57.\n\n\nA \"YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS\" sign flashes past.\n\nBob Dylan plays: \"Memphis Blues Again -- \"Aaww, Mama, can\nthis really by the end...?\"\n\nA sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nJesus, bad waves of paranoia,\nmadness, fear and loathing --\nintolerable vibrations in this\nplace.  Get out!  The weasels were\nclosing in.  I could smell the ugly\nbrutes.  Flee!\n\nDUKE drives fast.\n\nDUKE\nDo me one last favor Lord: just\ngive me five more high-speed hours\nbefore you bring the hammer down;\njust let me get rid of this goddamn\ncar and off of this horrible desert.\n\nA sign flashes \"YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.\"\n\nA patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nYou evil bastard!  This is your\nwork!  You'd better take care of\nme, Lord... because if you don't\nyou're going to have me on your\nhands.\n\nThe patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nFew people understand the psychology\nof dealing with a Highway Traffic\nCop.  Your normal speeder will\npanic and immediately pull over to\nthe side.  This is wrong.\n\nDUKE floors the gas pedal.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt arouses contempt in the cop heart.\n\nTHE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.\n\n58.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMake the bastard chase you.  He\nwill follow.  But he won't know\nwhat to make of your blinker signal\nthat says you're about to turn right.\n\nDUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThis is to let him know you're\nlooking for a proper place to pull\noff and talk.\n\nAN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.\n\nDUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt will take him a moment to\nrealize that he is about to make\n180 degree turn at speed... but you\nwill be ready for it, braced for\nthe G's and the fast heel toe work.\n\nThe patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.\n\nEXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY\n\nThe patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE\nstands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nJust what the FUCK did you think\nyou were doing?!\n\nDUKE smiles.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nMay I see your license.\n\nDUKE\nOf course, officer.\n\nDUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer\ncan -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI knew I was fucked.\n\nThe COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for\nDUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.\n\n59.\n\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nCould I have that, please?\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  It was getting warm anyway.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --\nglances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars\nof soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nYou realize...\n\nDUKE\nYeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I\nunderstand that.  I knew it was a\ncrime but I did it anyway.  Shit,\nwhy argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nThat's a strange attitude.\n\nHe looks at DUKE thoughtfully.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nYou know -- I get the feeling you\ncould use a nap.  There's a rest\narea up ahead.  Why don't you pull\nover and sleep a few hours?\n\nDUKE\nA nap won't help.  I've been awake\nfor too long -- three or four\nnights.  I can't even remember.  If\nI go to sleep now, I'm dead for\ntwenty hours.\n\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nOkay.  Here's how it is.  What goes\ninto my book, as of noon, is that I\napprehended you... for driving too\nfast, and advised you to proceed no\nfurther than the next rest area...\nyour stated destination, right?\nWhere you plan to take a long nap.\nDo I make myself clear?\n\nDUKE\nHow far is Baker?  I was hoping to\nstop there for lunch.\n\n60.\n\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nNot my jurisdiction.  The city\nlimits are two point two miles\nbeyond the rest area.  Can you make\nit that far?\n\nDUKE\nI'll try.  I've been wanting to go\nto Baker for a long time.  I've\nheard a lot about it.\n\nThe PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nExcellent seafood.  With a mind\nlike yours, you'll probably want to\ntry the land-crab.  Try the Majestic\nDiner.\n\nThe PATROLMAN slams the door shut.\n\nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY\n\nDUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI felt raped.  The Pig had done me\non all fronts, and now he was going\noff to chuckle about it -- on the\nwest side of town, waiting for me\nto make a run for L.A.\n\nDUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he\nsignals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn\nhe sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn\ntheir eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER\ndrops his thumb.\n\nDUKE\nGreat Jesus, it's him.\n\nDUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE\nWAY HE CAME.\n\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.\n\nDUKE\nThey've nailed me!  I'm trapped in\nsome stinking desert crossroads\ncalled Baker.  I don't have much\ntime.  The fuckers are closing in.\nThey'll hunt me down like a beast!\n\n61.\n\n\nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nGONZO sits surrounded by legal papers and law books.  Mexican\nDay of the Dead masks hang from the walls -- flame-red demons.\n\nGONZO\nWho?  You sound a little paranoid.\n\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE screams -- sweat pouring.\n\nDUKE\nYou bastard!  I need a lawyer\nimmediately!\n\nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nGONZO\nWhat are you doing in Baker?\nDidn't you get my telegram?\n\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE\nWhat?  Fuck telegrams.  I'm in\ntrouble.  You worthless bastard.\nI'll cripple your ass for this!\nAll that shit in the car is yours!\nYou understand that?  When I finish\ntestifying out here you'll be\ndisbarred!\n\nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\n\nGONZO\nYou're supposed to be in Vegas.  We\nhave a suite at the Flamingo.  I\nwas just about to leave for the\nairport.\n\nINT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\n\nDUKE pulls out the telegram from his top pocket.\n\nGONZO'S VOICE\nYou brainless scumbag!  You're\nsupposed to be covering the National\nDistrict Attorney's conference!  I\nmade all the reservations... rented\na white Cadillac convertible... the\nwhole thing is arranged!  What the\nhell are you doing out there in the\nmiddle of the fucking desert?\n\n62.\n\n\nDUKE stares at the telegram.\n\nDUKE\nNever mind.  It's all a big joke.\nI'm actually sitting beside the\npool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking\nfrom a portable phone.  Some dwarf\nbrought it out from the casino.  I\nhave total credit!  Can you grasp\nthat?\n(shouts)\nDon't come anywhere near this place!\nForeigners aren't welcome here!\n\nDUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone.\n\nEXT. DESERT - DAY\n\nC/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWell.  This is how the world works.\n\nC/U An IGUANA basks in the sun.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nAll energy flows according to the\nwhims of the Great Magnet.\n\nC/U Barrel of the gun.  It fires.  An explosion of desert\ndirt.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhat a fool I was to defy Him.\n\nThe IGUANA sits unfazed.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nNever cross the Great Magnet.  I\nunderstood this now...\n(another blast from\nthe gun)\n... and with understanding came a\nsense of almost terminal relief.\n\nDUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the\nthuds of the explosions echo away.\n\nEXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY\n\nThe RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.\n\n63.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI had to get rid of The Shark.  Too\nmany people might recognize it...\n...especially the Vegas Police.\n(tight C/U of DUKE)\nLuckily, my credit card was still\ntechnically valid.\n\nPULL BACK TO REVEAL:\n\nDUKE, now driving a white Cadillac Coupe de Ville -- THE\nWHITE WHALE.\n\nDUKE pushes buttons -- lowers the top.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThis was a superior machine -- ten\ngrand worth of gimmicks and high\nprice special effects.  The rear\nwindows leapt up with a touch like\nfrogs in a dynamited pond.  The\ndashboard was full of esoteric\nlights and dials and meters that I\nwould never understand.\n\nEXT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - AFTERNOON\n\nA GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S\nCONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIf the Pigs were gathering in\nVegas, I felt the Drug Culture\nshould be represented as well...\nand there was a certain bent appeal\nin the notion of running a savage\nburn on one Las Vegas hotel and\nthen just wheeling across town and\nchecking into another.\n\nThe WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately\nattended by impressed MINIONS.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMe and a thousand ranking cops from\nall over America.  Why not?  Move\nconfidently into their midst.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON\n\nDUKE enters -- old Levis, grubby sneakers, 10 peso Acapulco\nshirt coming apart at the seams, 3 day growth, eyes hidden\nbehind mirror shades.  He heads for the check-in line.\n\n64.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy arrival was badly timed.\n\nTHE PLACE IS FULL OF COPS.  200 of them, on vacation, all\ndressed in cut price Vegas casuals: plaid Bermuda shorts,\nArnie Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals.\n\nAhead of DUKE -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK.\nThe POLICE CHIEF'S AGNEW STYLE WIFE stands to the side,\nweeping.  The POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around.\n\nPOLICE CHIEF\nWhat do you mean I'm too late to\nregister?  I'm a police chief.\nFrom Michigan.  Look, fella, I told\nyou.\n(waves a POSTCARD)\nI have a postcard here that says I\nhave reservations in this hotel.\n\nCLERK\n(prissily)\nI'm sorry, sir.  You're on the\n\"late list.\" Your reservations were\ntransferred to the... ah...\nMoonlight Motel, which is out on\nParadise Boulevard...\n\nPOLICE CHIEF\nI've already paid for my goddamn\nroom!\n\nCLERK\nIt's actually a very fine place of\nlodging and only sixteen blocks\nfrom here, with its own pool and...\n\nPOLICE CHIEF\nYou dirty little faggot!  Call the\nmanager!  I'm tired of listening to\nthis dogshit!\n\nFRIENDS restrain the POLICE CHIEF.\n\nCLERK\n(solicitously)\nI'm so sorry, sir.  May I call you\na cab?\n\nThe POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nOf course, I could hear what the\nClerk was really saying...\n\n65.\n\n\nCLERK\n(IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION)\nListen, you fuzzy little shithead --\nI've been fucked around, in my\ntime, by a fairly good cross-\nsection of mean-tempered rule-crazy\ncops and now it's MY turn. \"Fuck\nyou, officer, I'm in charge here,\nand I'm telling you we don't have\nroom for you.\"\n\nDUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.\n\nDUKE\nSay.  I hate to interrupt, but I\nwonder if maybe I could just sort\nof slide through and get out of\nyour way.  Name's Raoul Duke --\nRaoul Duke.  My attorney made the\nreservation.\n\nDUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE\ngoes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he\nwas some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The\nCLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.\n\nCLERK\nCertainly, Mr. Duke!\n\nDUKE\nMy bags are out there in that white\nCadillac convertible.  Can you have\nsomeone drive it around to the room?\n\nALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.\n\nDUKE\nOh, and could I get a quart of Wild\nTurkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and\na night's worth of ice delivered to\nmy room, please?\n\nCLERK\nDon't worry about a thing, sir.\nJust enjoy your stay.\n\nDUKE\nWell, thank you.\n\nDUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the\nelevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of\nbeer and toasts them.  The doors close.\n\n66.\n\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE rams the key home -- swings the door open.\n\nDUKE\nAh, home at last!\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON\n\nDUKE enters.  The door hits something with a thud.\n\nA 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull.\n\nGONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a\ndrug-addled grin on his face.\n\nDUKE\nYou degenerate pig!\n\nGONZO\nIt can't be helped.  This is Lucy.\n(laughing distractedly)\nYou know--like \"Lucy In The Sky\nWith Diamonds.\"\n\nLUCY eyes DUKE venomously.\n\nGONZO\nLucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit!\nRemember what happened at the\nairport!  No more of that, okay?\n\nLUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his\narm round her shoulder.\n\nGONZO\nLucy... this is my client.  This is\nMr. Duke, the famous journalist.\nHe's paying for this suite, Lucy.\nHe's on our side.\n\nDUKE flops onto the sofa.\n\nGONZO\nMr. Duke is my friend.  He loves\nartists.\n\nDUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of\nartwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in\ncharcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.\n\nGONZO\nLucy paints portraits of Barbra\nStreisand.\n\n67.\n\n\nLUCY\nI drew these from TV.\n\nGONZO\nFantastic.  She came all the way\ndown here from Montana just to give\nthese portraits to Barbra.  We're\ngoing over to the Americana Hotel\ntonight to meet her backstage...\n\nDUKE's voice rises above GONZO.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI desperately needed peace, rest,\nsanctuary.  I hadn't counted on\nthis.  Finding my attorney on acid\nand locked into some kind of\npreternatural courtship.\n\nDUKE\nWell, I guess they brought the car\nround by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF\nOUT OF THE TRUNK.\n\nDUKE fixes GONZO hard.\n\nGONZO\nAbsolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF.\n(to LUCY)\nNow, we'll be right back.  Don't\nanswer the phone if it rings.\n\nLUCY\n(makes one-fingered\nJesus freak sign)\nGod bless.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE collars GONZO -- serious.\n\nDUKE\nWELL?  What are your plans?\n\nGONZO\nPlans?\n\nDUKE\nLucy.\n\n68.\n\n\nGONZO\n(struggling to focus)\nShit.  I met her on the plane and I\nhad all that acid.\n(he shrugs)\nYou know, those little blue barrels.\nI gave her a cap before I realized...\nshe's a religious freak... Jesus,\nshe's never even had a drink.\n\nDUKE\nWell... It'll probably work out.\nWe can keep her loaded and peddle\nher ass at the drug convention.\n\nGONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.\n\nGONZO\nListen, she's running away from\nhome for something like the fifth\ntime in six months.  It's terrible.\n\nDUKE\nShe's perfect for this gig.  These\ncops will go fifty bucks a head to\nbeat her into submission and then\ngang fuck her.  We can set her up\nin one of these back street motels,\nhang pictures of Jesus all over the\nroom, then turn these pigs loose on\nher... Hell she's strong; she'll\nhold her own.\n\nGONZO's face twitches badly.\n\nGONZO\nJesus Christ.  I knew you were sick\nbut I never expected to hear you\nactually say that kind of stuff.\n\nDUKE\nIt's straight economics.  This girl\nis a god-send.  Shit, she can make\nus a grand a day.\n\nGONZO\nNO!  Stop talking like that.\n\nDUKE\nI figure she can do about four at a\ntime.  Christ, if we keep her full\nof acid that's more like two grand\na day.  Maybe three.\n\n69.\n\n\nGONZO\nYou filthy bastard.  I should cave\nyour fucking head in.\n\nDUKE\nIn a few hours, she'll probably be\nsane enough to work herself into a\ntowering Jesus-based rage at the\nhazy recollection of being seduced\nby some kind of cruel Samoan who\nfed her liquor and LSD, dragged her\nto a Vegas hotel room and savagely\npenetrated every orifice in her\nbody with his throbbing,\nuncircumcised member.\n\nGONZO starts crying.\n\nGONZO\nNO!  I felt sorry for the girl, I\nwanted to help her!\n\nDUKE\nYou'll go straight to the gas\nchamber.  And even if you manage to\nbeat that, they'll send you back to\nNevada for Rape and Consensual\nSodomy.  She's got to go.\n\nPause.\n\nGONZO\nShit, it doesn't pay to try to help\nsomebody these days.\n\nA silence.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe only alternative was to take\nher out to the desert and feed her\nremains to the lizards.  But, it\nseemed a bit heavy for the thing we\nwere trying to protect: My attorney.\n\nGONZO\nWe have to cut her loose.  She's\ngot two hundred dollars.  And we\ncan always call the cops up there\nin Montana, where she lives, and\nturn her in.\n\nDUKE\nWhat?... What kind of goddamn\nmonster are you?\n\n70.\n\n\nGONZO\nIt just occurred to me, that she\nhas no witnesses.  Anything that\nshe says about us is completely\nworthless.\n\nDUKE\nUs?\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET\n\nDUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.\n\nDUKE\nHotel Americana?  I need a\nreservation.  For my niece.  Listen,\nI need her treated very gently.\nShe's an artist, and might seem a\ntrifle highstrung...\n\nIn the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the\ndoor.\n\nGONZO\nOkay, Lucy, it's time to go meet\nBarbra...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI felt like a Nazi, but it had to\nbe done.\n\nEXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK\n\nThe WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps\nLUCY and her paintings from the car.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nLucy was a potentially fatal\nmillstone on both our necks.  There\nwas absolutely no choice but to cut\nher adrift and hope her memory was\nfucked.\n\nGONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --\nwaves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting\nto come down...\n\nGONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands\ntogether as if washing his hands of the situation.\n\nGONZO\nWell that's that.  Take off slowly.\nDon't attract attention.\n\n71.\n\n\nThey pull out into traffic.\n\nEXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK\n\nGONZO\nI gave the cabbie an extra ten\nbucks to make sure she gets there\nsafe.  Also, I told him I'd be\nthere myself in an hour, and if she\nwasn't, I'd come back out here and\nrip his lungs out.\n\nDUKE\nThat's good.  You can't be subtle\nin this town.\n\nGONZO\nAs your attorney, I advise you to\ntell me where you put the goddamn\nmescaline.\n\nDUKE\nMaybe we should take it easy tonight.\n\nGONZO\nRight.  Let's find a good seafood\nrestaurant and eat some red salmon.\nI feel a powerful lust for red\nsalmon...\n\nThe electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The\nsun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson\ntune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING\n\nGONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.\n\nIn the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him.\n\nDUKE\nCome on, we're going to be late.\n\nGONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth\nwith a towel.\n\nGONZO\nThis goddamn mescaline.  Why the\nfuck can't they make it a little\nless pure?  Maybe mix it up with\nRolaids or something.\n\n72.\n\n\nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY\n\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n(crackling and\nbooming over the\nlousy sound system)\nOn behalf of the prosecuting\nattorneys of this county, I welcome\nyou to the Third National DA's\nConference on Narcotics and\nDangerous Drugs.\n\nThe EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman\ntype -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads:\nNATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. \"If You Don't Know, Come To\nLearn... If You Know, Come To Teach.\"\n\nA BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS\nAND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod\ndress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be\nWITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around\n20 REDNECKS.\n\nA dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles\ndistort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.\n\nAt the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI\nwingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name\ntag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.\n\nGONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT,\nCRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge.\n\nGONZO\n(lowers his voice)\nI saw these bastards in Easy Rider,\nbut I didn't believe they were real.\nNot like this.  Not hundreds of them!\n\nDUKE\nThey're actually nice people when\nyou get to know them.\n\nGONZO\nMan, I know these people in my\ngoddamn blood!\n\nDUKE\nDon't mention that word around here.\nYou'll get them excited.\n\nGONZO\nThis is a fucking nightmare.\n\n73.\n\n\nDUKE\nRight.  Sure as hell some dope-\ndealing bomb freak is going to\nrecognize you and put the word out\nthat you're partying with a thousand\ncops.\n\nCOP IN BACK\nSSSSHHH!\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST -- a \"drug expert\" -- takes the stage.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nWe must come to terms with the Drug\nCulture in the country... country...\ncountry...\n\nThe sound systems echoes.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)\nThe reefer butt is called a \"roach,\"\nbecause it resembles a cockroach...\ncockroach... cockroach...\n\nGONZO\n(whispers)\nWhat the fuck are these people\ntalking about?  You'd have to be\ncrazy on acid to think a joint\nlooked like a goddamn cockroach!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt was clear that we had stumbled\ninto a prehistoric gathering.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nNow, there are four states of being\nin the cannabis, or marijuana,\nsociety: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and\nSquare.  The square is seldom if\never cool.  He is not \"with it,\"\nthat is, he doesn't know \"what's\nhappening.\" But if he manages to\nfigure it out, he moves up a notch\nto \"hip.\"\n\nDUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)\nAnd if he can bring himself to\napprove of what is happening, he\nbecomes \"groovy.\" After that, with\nmuch luck and perseverance, he can\nrise to the rank of \"cool.\" A cool\nguy... cool guy... cool guy...\n\n74.\n\n\nCOP IN BACK\nDr. Bloomquist, do you think the\nanthropologist, Margaret Mead's\nstrange behavior of late might\npossibly be explained by a private\nmarijuana addiction?\n\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nI really don't know, but at her\nage, if she did smoke grass, she'd\nhave one hell of a trip!\n\nRoars of laughter.\n\nGONZO\nI know a hell of a lot better ways\nto waste my time than listening to\nthis bullshit.\n\nHe stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and\nplunges down the aisle to the door.\n\nCOP IN BACK\nDown in front!\n\nGONZO\nFuck you!  I have to get out!  I\ndon't belong here!\n\nCOP IN BACK\nGood riddance!\n\nHe stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to\nthe stage.\n\nThe lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER\nMADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nKNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE\nMAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be\nable to see his eyes because of\nTea-Shades, but his knuckles will\nbe white from inner tension...\n\nDUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF\nwho necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\n... and his pants will be crusted\nwith semen from constantly jacking\noff when he can't find a rape\nvictim...\n\n75.\n\n\nDUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness,\nhe gets up, hand over mouth.\n\nDUKE\nPardon me, I feel sick.\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nHe will stagger and babble when\nquestioned.  He will not respect\nyour badge.  The Dope Fiend fears\nnothing.  He will attack, for no\nreason, with every weapon at his\ncommand -- including yours...\n\nDUKE heads for the exit.\n\nDUKE\nSorry, sick... Beg pardon!  Feeling\nsick...\n\nFILM NARRATOR\nBEWARE.  Any officer apprehending a\nsuspected marijuana addict should\nuse all necessary force immediately.\nOne stitch in time [on him] will\nusually save nine on you.\n\nDUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.\n\nINT. CASINO BAR - DAY\n\nDUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING\nCOP about 40 whose name tag identifies him as a DISTRICT\nATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA.\n\nDA\nI'm a whiskey man myself.  We don't\nhave much trouble from drugs where\nI come from...\n\nGONZO\nYou will.  One of these nights\nyou'll wake up and find a junkie\ntearing your bedroom apart.\n\nDA\nNaw!\n\nGONZO\nThey'll climb right into your\nbedroom and sit on your chest with\nbig Bowie knives.  They might even\nsit on your wife's chest.  Put the\nblade right down on her throat.\n\n76.\n\n\nDA\nNot down in my parts.\n\nDUKE joins them.\n\nDUKE\n(to WAITRESS)\nRum and ice, please.\n\nDA\n(looks at DUKE'S NAME TAG)\nYou're another one of these\nCalifornia boys.  Your friend\nhere's been tellin' us about dope\nfiends.\n\nDUKE\nThey're everywhere.  Nobody's safe.\nAnd sure as hell not in the South.\nThey like warm weather... You'd\nnever believe it.  In L.A. it's out\nof control.  First it was drugs,\nnow it's witchcraft.\n\nDA\nWitchcraft?  Shit, you can't mean it!\n\nThe BARTENDER cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the\nconversation.\n\nGONZO\nRead the newspapers.\n\nDUKE\nMan, you don't know trouble until\nyou have to face down a bunch of\nthese addicts gone crazy for human\nsacrifice!\n\nDA\nNaw!  That's science fiction stuff!\n\nDUKE\nNot where we operate.\n\nGONZO\nHell, in Malibu alone, these\ngoddamn Satan worshippers kill six\nor eight people every day.  All\nthey want is the blood.  They'll\ntake people right off the street if\nthey have to.\n\n77.\n\n\nDUKE\nJust the other day we had a case\nwhere they grabbed a girl right out\nof a McDonald's hamburger stand.\nShe was a waitress, about sixteen\nyears old... with a lot of people\nwatching, too!\n\nThe BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more\nfuriously.\n\nDA\nWhat happened?  What did they do to\nher?\n\nGONZO\nDo?  Jesus Christ, man.  They\nchopped her goddamn head off right\nthere in the parking lot!  Then\nthey cut all kinds of holes in her\nhead and sucked out the blood!\n\nDA\n(DA ad-libs a\nsummation of the crime)\nAnd nobody did anything?\n\nDUKE\nWhat could they do?  The guy that\ntook the head was about six-seven,\nand maybe three-hundred pounds.  He\nwas packing two Lugers, and the\nothers had M-16s.\n\nGONZO\nThey just ran back out into Death\nValley -- you know, where Manson\nturned up...\n\nDUKE\nLike big lizards.\n\nGONZO\n... and every one of them stacked\nnaked...\n\nDA\nNaked!?\n\nDUKE\nNaked.\n\n78.\n\n\nGONZO\nYeh, naked!... except for the\nweapons.\n\nDUKE\nThey were all veterans.\n\nDA\nVeterans?!!!?\n\nAgog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes\nthe glass -- faster and faster...\n\nGONZO\nYeh.  The big guy used to be a\nmajor in the Marines.\n\nDA\nA major!\n\nGONZO\nWe know where he lives, but we\ncan't get near the house.\n\nDA\nNaw!  Not a major.\n\nGONZO\nHe wanted the pineal gland.\n\nDA\nReally?\n\nGONZO\nThat's how he got so big.  When he\nquit the Marines he was just a\nlittle guy.\n\nDUKE\nUsually, it's whole families.\nDuring the night.  Most of them\ndon't even wake up until they feel\ntheir heads going -- and then, of\ncourse, it's too late.\n\nThe glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nHappens every day.\n\nDUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile.\n\n79.\n\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nThree more rums.  Plenty of ice.\nMaybe a handful of lime chunks.\n\nWAITRESS\nAre you guys with the police\nconvention upstairs?\n\nDA\nWe sure are, Miss.\n\nWAITRESS\nI thought so.  I never heard that\nkind of talk around here before.\nJesus Christ!  How do you guys\nstand that kind of work?\n\nGONZO\n(grinning)\nWe like it.  It's groovy.\n\nThe WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO.\n\nDUKE\nWhat's wrong with you?  Hell,\nsomebody has to do it.\n\nGONZO\nHurry up with those drinks.  We're\nthirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine\na Bloody Mary.\n\nDA\n(whacks his fist on\nthe bar)\nHell, I really hate to hear this.\nBecause everything that happens in\nCalifornia seems to get down our\nway, sooner or later.  Mostly\nAtlanta.  But that was back when\nthe goddamn bastards were peaceful.\nAll we had to do was to keep 'em\nunder surveillance.  They didn't\nroam around much... But now Jesus,\nit seems nobody's safe.\n\nGONZO\n(with a conspiratorial\nnod)\nYou're going to need to take the\nbull by the horns -- go to the mat\nwith this scum.\n\n80.\n\n\nDA\nWhat do you mean by that?\n\nGONZO\nYou know what I mean.  We've done\nit before and we can damn well do\nit again!\n\nDUKE\nCut their goddamn heads off.  Every\none of them.  That's what we're\ndoing in California.\n\nDA\n(stupefied)\nWHAT?\n\nGONZO\nSure.  It's all on the Q.T., but\neverybody who matters is with us\nall the way down the line.\n\nDUKE\nWe keep it quiet.  It's not the\nkind of thing you'd want to talk\nabout upstairs.  Not with the press\naround.\n\nDA\n(recovering slightly)\nHell, no.  We'd never hear the\ngoddamn end of it.\n\nDUKE\nDobermans don't talk.\n\nDA\nWhat?\n\nGONZO\nSometimes it's easier to just rip\nout the backstraps.\n\nDUKE\nThey'll fight like hell if you try\nto take the head without the dogs.\n\nDA\nGod almighty!\n(muttering in a daze)\nI don't think I should tell my wife\nabout this.  She'd never understand.\nYou know how women are.\n\n81.\n\n\nDUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back.\n\nDUKE\nJust be thankful your heart is\nyoung and strong.\n\nDUKE and GONZO leave the stunned DA -- staring into the\nswirling ice in drink.\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.\n\nGONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the\nbathroom.  Immediate sounds of retching.\n\nThe phone message light is blinking.  DUKE opens a beer,\npicks up the phone.\n\nDUKE\nWhat's the message?  My light is\nblinking.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nAh, yes.  Mr. Duke?  You have one\nmessage: \"Call Lucy at the Americana\nHotel, room 1600.\"\n\nDUKE\nHoly shit!\n\nDUKE slams the phone down.  GONZO emerges from the\nbathroom -- looking like death.\n\nDUKE\nLucy called.\n\nGONZO sags visibly -- like an animal taking a bullet.\n\nGONZO\nWhat?\n\nThe telephone rings.  DUKE answers.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY\n\nA worried CLERK speaks in to the phone.\n\nCLERK\nMr. Duke?  Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm\nsorry we were cut off a moment\nago... I thought I should call\nagain, because I was wondering...\n\n82.\n\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE\nWHAT?\n(hand over the PHONE)\nWhat was that crazy bitch said to\nhim?\n(screams)\nThere's a war on, man!  People are\nbeing killed!\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nKilled?\n\nDUKE\nIN VIETNAM!  ON THE GODDAMN\nTELEVISION!\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nOh... yes... yes... This terrible\nwar.  When will it end?\n\nDUKE\nTell me.  What do you want?\n\nIn the background GONZO is upturning a sofa to retrieve his\nstash from the lining.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nThe woman who left that message for\nyou sounded very disturbed.  I\nthink she was crying...\n\nDUKE\nCrying?  Why was she crying?\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nWell, uh.  She didn't say Mr. Duke.\nBut since I know you're here with\nthe Police Convention...\n\nDUKE\nLook, you want to be gentle with\nthat woman if she ever calls again.\nWe're watching her very carefully...\nthis woman has been into laudanum.\nIt's a controlled experiment, but I\nsuspect we'll need your cooperation\nbefore this thing is over.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\n(hesitantly)\nWell, certainly... We're always\nhappy to cooperate with the police...\n\n83.\n\n\nDUKE\nDon't worry.  You're protected.\nJust treat this poor woman like\nyou'd treat any other human being\nin trouble.\n\nCLERK (V/O)\nWhat?  Ah... yes, yes, I see what\nyou mean... Yes... so, you'll be\nresponsible then?\n\nDUKE\nOf course.  And now I have to get\nback to the news.  Send up some ice.\n\nHe hangs up.  GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.\n\nGONZO\nGood work.  They'll treat us like\ngoddamn lepers after that.\n\nDUKE\n(slowly, carefully)\nLucy is looking for you.\n\nGONZO\n(laughing)\nNo, she's looking for you.\n\nDUKE\nMe?\n\nGONZO\nShe really flipped over you.  The\nonly way I could get rid of her was\nby saying you were taking me out to\nthe desert for a showdown -- that\nyou wanted me out of the way so you\ncould have her all to yourself.\n(laughing again)\nI guess she figures you won.  That\nphone message wasn't for me, was it?\n\nA look of stunned realization from DUKE...\n\nINT. FANTASY COURT ROOM - DAY\n\nLUCY is on the witness stand.\n\nLUCY\nYessir, those two men in the dock\nare the ones who gave me the LSD\nand took me to the hotel.\n\n84.\n\n\nA doomed DUKE and GONZO await their fate.\n\nLUCY\nI don't know for sure what they\ndone to me, but I remember it was\nhorrible.\n\nJUDGE\nTwenty years... and Double\nCastration!\n\nThe JUDGE bangs his gavel.\n\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY\n\nDUKE is madly stuffing his suitcase.\n\nGONZO\nWait!  You can't leave me alone in\nthis snake pit.  This room is in my\nname.\n\nDUKE KEEPS PACKING.  GONZO is looking worried.\n\nGONZO\nOK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call\nher.  I'll get her off our backs.\nYou're right.  She's my problem.\n\nDUKE\nIt's gone too far.\n\nGONZO\nRelax.  Let me handle this.\n(dials the PHONE,\nsnaps angrily at DUKE)\nYou'd make a piss-poor lawyer.\n...Room 1600, please.\n(to DUKE)\nAs your attorney, I advise you not\nto worry.\n(nods towards bathroom)\nTake a hit out of that little brown\nbottle in my shaving kit.\n\nDUKE goes in the bathroom.  He finds a little bottle -- a\nlabel: \"DRINK ME.\"\n\nDUKE\nWhat is this?\n\n85.\n\n\nGONZO\nYou won't need much.  Just a little\ntiny taste, that stuff makes pure\nmescaline seem like ginger-beer.\nAdrenochrome.\n\nDUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.\n\nDUKE\nAdrenochrome...\n\nGONZO\n(into PHONE)\nHi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got\nyour message...what?  Hell, no, I\ntaught the bastard a lesson he'll\nnever forget... what?  No, not\ndead, but he won't be bothering\nanybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left\nhim out there, I stomped him, then\npulled all his teeth out...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember thinking, \"Jesus, what a\nterrible thing to lay on somebody\nwith a head full of acid.\"\n\nDUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies\nit -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...\n\nGONZO\n(to PHONE)\nBut here's the problem.  That\nbastard cashed a bad check\ndownstairs and gave you as a\nreference.  They'll be looking for\nboth of you.  Yeah, I know, but you\ncan't judge a book by its cover,\nLucy.  Some people are just\nbasically rotten... Anyway, the\nlast thing you want to do is call\nthis hotel again; they'll trace the\ncall and put you straight behind\nbars... no, I'm moving to the\nTropicana right away.  I have to\ngo, they've got the phone tapped.\nYeah, I know, it was horrible, but\nit's all over now... OH MY GOD!\nTHEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN!\n(throws the PHONE\ndown; shouts)\nNo!  Get away from me!  I'm innocent!\nIt was Duke!  I swear to God!\n(MORE)\n\n86.\n\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\n(stomps the PHONE; moans)\nNo, I don't know where she is.\nYou'll never catch Lucy!  She's\ngone!  I swear, I don't know where\nshe is!  DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME!\n(slams the PHONE down)\n\n\nGONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.\n\nGONZO\nWell.  That's that.  She's probably\nstuffing herself down the\nincinerator about now.  That's the\nlast we should be hearing from Lucy.\n(fumbling with the\nhash pipe)\nWhere's the opium?\n\nDUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY\nSTRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember slumping on the bed, his\nperformance had given me a bad jolt.\nFor a moment I thought his mind had\nsnapped -- that he actually believed\nhe was being attacked by invisible\nenemies.  But the room was quiet\nagain.\n\nDUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE.\n\nDUKE\nWhere'd you get this?\n\nGONZO\nNever mind, it's absolutely pure.\n\nDUKE\nJesus... what kind of monster\nclient have you picked up this time?\nThere's only one source for this\nstuff -- the adrenaline gland from\na living human body!\n\nGONZO turns to smile at DUKE.\n\n87.\n\n\nGONZO\nI know, but the guy didn't have any\ncash to pay me.  He's one of these\nSatanism freaks.  He offered me\nhuman blood -- said it would take\nme higher than I've ever been in my\nlife.\n(laughs -- struts\nround DUKE -- eyes\nbright with expectation)\nI thought he was kidding, so I told\nhim I'd just as soon have an ounce\nor so of pure adrenochrome -- or\nmaybe just a fresh adrenaline gland\nto chew on.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI could already feel the stuff\nworking on me -- the first wave\nfelt like a combination of mescaline\nand methedrine -- maybe I should\ntake a swim, I thought...\n\nDUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...\n\nGONZO\nYeah, they nailed this guy for\nchild molesting.  He swore he\ndidn't do it. \"Why should I fuck\nwith children?\" he says. \"They're\ntoo small.\" Christ, werewolf is\nentitled to legal counsel.  I\ndidn't dare turn the creep down.\nHe might have picked up a letter\nopener and gone after my pineal\ngland!\n\nGONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE.  DUKE'S BODY IS\nGOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  We should get some of\nthat.  Just eat a big handful and\nsee what happens.\n\nGONZO\nSome of what?\n\nDUKE\n(spitting words)\nExtract of pineal!\n\n88.\n\n\nGONZO\n(STARING AT DUKE WITH\nA STRANGE SMILE)\nSure.  That's a good idea.  One\nwhiff of that shit would turn you\ninto something out of a goddamn\nmedical encyclopedia.\n\nGONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK.\n\nGONZO\nMan, your head would swell up like\na watermelon, you'd probably gain\nabout a hundred pounds in two\nhours...\n\nA CLOVEN HOOF BURSTS THROUGH GONZO'S SHOE.\n\nDUKE\nRight!\n\nGONZO\n... grow claws... bleeding warts.\n\nGONZO'S CHEST EXPANDS -- BONY RIBS BURSTING HIS SHIRT.\n\nDUKE\nYes!\n\nGONZO\n... then you'd notice about six\nhuge hairy tits swelling up on your\nback...\n\nA TAIL LASHES, HOOFS STRIKE THE FLOOR.  GONZO TOWERS -- A\nFLAME RED DEMON!\n\nDUKE\nFantastic!\n\nDUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY\nat the bedspread, JERKING IT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM.  His\nheels are dug into the mattress with both KNEES LOCKED,\nEYEBALLS SWELLING.\n\nGONZO-DEMON LOOMS AGAINST THE CEILING.\n\nGONZO\nyou'd go blind... your body would\nturn to wax... they'd have to put\nyou in a wheelbarrow and...\n\nGONZO'S VOICE FADES AWAY -- DUKE'S frenzied gaze reveals\nGONZO REVERTED TO NORMAL HUMAN SHAPE AND SIZE.\n\n89.\n\n\nGONZO\nMan I'll try about anything; but\nI'd never touch a pineal gland.\n\nDUKE\nFINISH THE FUCKING STORY!  What\nhappened?!  What about the glands?\n\nGONZO, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily...\ntowards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE...\n\nGONZO\nJesus, that stuff got right on top\nof you, didn't it.\n\nVEINS stand out on DUKE's forehead.  He is purplish-red.\nOVER THE TOP!  Too late, he realizes he is NEAR DEATH!\n\nDUKE\nMaybe you could just... shove me\ninto the pool, or something...\n\nGONZO shakes his head disgustedly.\n\nGONZO\nIf I put you in the pool right now,\nyou'd sink like a goddamn stone.\nYou took too much.  Jesus, look at\nyour face, you're about to explode.\n\nGONZO sits back down... watching the TV.\n\nGONZO\nDon't try and fight it, or you'll\nget brain bubbles.  Strokes,\naneurysms.  You'll just wither up\nand die.\n\nDUKE FALLS TO THE GROUND, WRITHING, CATATONIC, SINKING INTO\nPARALYSIS.\n\nAND THE SOUND, SUDDENLY AND STRANGELY, OF THE VOICE OF\nRICHARD NIXON AND HIS DISTORTED FACE ON THE TV SCREEN.\n\nNIXON\nSacrifice... sacrifice...\nsacrifice...\n\nDUKE PASSES OUT.\n\nBLACK SCREEN\n\n90.\n\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\n\nDarkness.  Insanely, somewhere NILSSON plays -- \"Put the\nlime in the coconut and mix em all up...\"\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhat kind of rat-bastard psychotic\nwould play that song -- right now,\nat this moment?\n\nDUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in.  He lies,\nawkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been\nthere days -- months.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhen I came to the general back\nalley ambiance of the suite was so\nrotten, so incredibly foul.  How\nlong had I been lying there?  Hours?\nDays?  Months?  All these signs of\nviolence.  What had happened?\n\nDUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE\nSIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving\nwhisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights\nreplace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,\npornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered\non a shattered mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere was evidence in this room of\nexcessive consumption of almost\nevery type of drug known to\ncivilized man since 1544 AD.\n\nDUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --\nHOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut what kind of addict would need\nall these coconut husks and crushed\nhoneydew rinds?  Would the presence\nof junkies account for all these\nuneaten french fries?  These\npuddles of glazed ketchup on the\nbureau?  Maybe so, but then why all\nthis booze?  And these crude\npornographic photos smeared with\nmustard that had dried to a hard\nyellow crust...\n\nDUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT\nRAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.\n\n91.\n\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThese were not the hoof prints of\nyour normal god-fearing junkie.  It\nwas too savage, too aggressive.\n\nQUICK FLASHBACK:\n\nGONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER:\n\nBACK IN THE ROOM:\n\nDUKE stares at the smashed mirror.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nGrim memories and bad flashbacks.\n\nIn the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN\nVOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS.\n\nDUKE unzips and pisses.  THERE IN THE TOILET BOWL IS THE\nMAGNUM .357!\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nSomething ugly had happened.

That way we won't have to\nrisk another of these little\nincidents, will we?\n\nMAID\nWhatever you say, gentlemen.  I\ncan't tell you how sorry I am about\nwhat happened...\n\nGONZO\nDon't worry, it's all over now.\nThank God for the decent people.\n\nShe smiles, repeating to herself \"One Hand Washes The Other\"\nas GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.\n\nCUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.\n\nA grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.\n\nGONZO ON TAPE\n...

Or buy your coach.\u201d\n\nVaccaro\u2019s audience, the members of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, bristled. These were eminent reformers\u2014among them the president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, two former heads of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and several university presidents and chancellors. The Knight Foundation, a nonprofit that takes an interest in college athletics as part of its concern with civic life, had tasked them with saving college sports from runaway commercialism as embodied by the likes of Vaccaro, who, since signing his pioneering shoe contract with Michael Jordan in 1984, had built sponsorship empires successively at Nike, Adidas, and Reebok. Not all the members could hide their scorn for the \u201csneaker pimp\u201d of schoolyard hustle, who boasted of writing checks for millions to everybody in higher education.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d asked Bryce Jordan, the president emeritus of Penn State, \u201cshould a university be an advertising medium for your industry?\u201d\n\nVaccaro did not blink. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t, sir,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou sold your souls, and you\u2019re going to continue selling them. You can be very moral and righteous in asking me that question, sir,\u201d Vaccaro added with irrepressible good cheer, \u201cbut there\u2019s not one of you in this room that\u2019s going to turn down any of our money. You\u2019re going to take it. I can only offer it.\u201d\n\nWilliam Friday, a former president of North Carolina\u2019s university system, still winces at the memory. \u201cBoy, the silence that fell in that room,\u201d he recalled recently. \u201cI never will forget it.\u201d Friday, who founded and co-chaired two of the three Knight Foundation sports initiatives over the past 20 years, called Vaccaro \u201cthe worst of all\u201d the witnesses ever to come before the panel.\n\nBut what Vaccaro said in 2001 was true then, and it\u2019s true now: corporations offer money so they can profit from the glory of college athletes, and the universities grab it. In 2010, despite the faltering economy, a single college athletic league, the football-crazed Southeastern Conference (SEC), became the first to crack the billion-dollar barrier in athletic receipts. The Big Ten pursued closely at $905 million. That money comes from a combination of ticket sales, concession sales, merchandise, licensing fees, and other sources\u2014but the great bulk of it comes from television contracts.\nEducators are in thrall to their athletic departments because of these television riches and because they respect the political furies that can burst from a locker room. \u201cThere\u2019s fear,\u201d Friday told me when I visited him on the University of North Carolina campus in Chapel Hill last fall. As we spoke, two giant construction cranes towered nearby over the university\u2019s Kenan Stadium, working on the latest $77 million renovation. (The University of Michigan spent almost four times that much to expand its Big House.) Friday insisted that for the networks, paying huge sums to universities was a bargain. \u201cWe do every little thing for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe furnish the theater, the actors, the lights, the music, and the audience for a drama measured neatly in time slots. They bring the camera and turn it on.\u201d Friday, a weathered idealist at 91, laments the control universities have ceded in pursuit of this money. If television wants to broadcast football from here on a Thursday night, he said, \u201cwe shut down the university at 3 o\u2019clock to accommodate the crowds.\u201d He longed for a campus identity more centered in an academic mission.\n\nThe United States is the only country in the world that hosts big-time sports at institutions of higher learning. This should not, in and of itself, be controversial. College athletics are rooted in the classical ideal of mens sane in corpore sano\u2014a sound mind in a sound body\u2014and who would argue with that? College sports are deeply inscribed in the culture of our nation. Half a million young men and women play competitive intercollegiate sports each year. Millions of spectators flock into football stadiums each Saturday in the fall, and tens of millions more watch on television. The March Madness basketball tournament each spring has become a major national event, with upwards of 80 million watching it on television and talking about the games around the office water cooler. ESPN has spawned ESPNU, a channel dedicated to college sports, and Fox Sports and other cable outlets are developing channels exclusively to cover sports from specific regions or divisions.\nWith so many people paying for tickets and watching on television, college sports has become Very Big Business. According to various reports, the football teams at Texas, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, and Penn State\u2014to name just a few big-revenue football schools\u2014each earn between $40 million and $80 million in profits a year, even after paying coaches multimillion-dollar salaries. When you combine so much money with such high, almost tribal, stakes\u2014football boosters are famously rabid in their zeal to have their alma mater win\u2014corruption is likely to follow.\n\nScandal after scandal has rocked college sports. In 2010, the NCAA sanctioned the University of Southern California after determining that star running back Reggie Bush and his family had received \u201cimproper benefits\u201d while he played for the Trojans. (Among other charges, Bush and members of his family were alleged to have received free airfare and limousine rides, a car, and a rent-free home in San Diego, from sports agents who wanted Bush as a client.) The Bowl Championship Series stripped USC of its 2004 national title, and Bush returned the Heisman Trophy he had won in 2005. Last fall, as Auburn University football stormed its way to an undefeated season and a national championship, the team\u2019s star quarterback, Cam Newton, was dogged by allegations that his father had used a recruiter to solicit up to $180,000 from Mississippi State in exchange for his son\u2019s matriculation there after junior college in 2010. Jim Tressel, the highly successful head football coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes, resigned last spring after the NCAA alleged he had feigned ignorance of rules violations by players on his team. At least 28 players over the course of the previous nine seasons, according to Sports Illustrated, had traded autographs, jerseys, and other team memorabilia in exchange for tattoos or cash at a tattoo parlor in Columbus, in violation of NCAA rules. Late this summer, Yahoo Sports reported that the NCAA was investigating allegations that a University of Miami booster had given millions of dollars in illicit cash and services to more than 70 Hurricanes football players over eight years.\n\nThe list of scandals goes on. With each revelation, there is much wringing of hands. Critics scold schools for breaking faith with their educational mission, and for failing to enforce the sanctity of \u201camateurism.\u201d Sportswriters denounce the NCAA for both tyranny and impotence in its quest to \u201cclean up\u201d college sports. Observers on all sides express jumbled emotions about youth and innocence, venting against professional mores or greedy amateurs.\nFor all the outrage, the real scandal is not that students are getting illegally paid or recruited, it\u2019s that two of the noble principles on which the NCAA justifies its existence\u2014\u201camateurism\u201d and the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d\u2014are cynical hoaxes, legalistic confections propagated by the universities so they can exploit the skills and fame of young athletes. The tragedy at the heart of college sports is not that some college athletes are getting paid, but that more of them are not.\n\n\nDon Curtis, a UNC trustee, told me that impoverished football players cannot afford movie tickets or bus fare home. Curtis is a rarity among those in higher education today, in that he dares to violate the signal taboo: \u201cI think we should pay these guys something.\u201d\nFans and educators alike recoil from this proposal as though from original sin. Amateurism is the whole point, they say. Paid athletes would destroy the integrity and appeal of college sports. Many former college athletes object that money would have spoiled the sanctity of the bond they enjoyed with their teammates. I, too, once shuddered instinctively at the notion of paid college athletes.\n\nBut after an inquiry that took me into locker rooms and ivory towers across the country, I have come to believe that sentiment blinds us to what\u2019s before our eyes. Big-time college sports are fully commercialized. Billions of dollars flow through them each year. The NCAA makes money, and enables universities and corporations to make money, from the unpaid labor of young athletes.\nSlavery analogies should be used carefully. College athletes are not slaves. Yet to survey the scene\u2014corporations and universities enriching themselves on the backs of uncompensated young men, whose status as \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d deprives them of the right to due process guaranteed by the Constitution\u2014is to catch an unmistakable whiff of the plantation. Perhaps a more apt metaphor is colonialism: college sports, as overseen by the NCAA, is a system imposed by well-meaning paternalists and rationalized with hoary sentiments about caring for the well-being of the colonized. But it is, nonetheless, unjust. The NCAA, in its zealous defense of bogus principles, sometimes destroys the dreams of innocent young athletes.\n\nThe NCAA today is in many ways a classic cartel. Efforts to reform it\u2014most notably by the three Knight Commissions over the course of 20 years\u2014have, while making changes around the edges, been largely fruitless. The time has come for a major overhaul. And whether the powers that be like it or not, big changes are coming. Threats loom on multiple fronts: in Congress, the courts, breakaway athletic conferences, student rebellion, and public disgust. Swaddled in gauzy clich\u00e9s, the NCAA presides over a vast, teetering glory.\nFounding Myths\nFrom the start, amateurism in college sports has been honored more often in principle than in fact; the NCAA was built of a mixture of noble and venal impulses. In the late 19th century, intellectuals believed that the sporting arena simulated an impending age of Darwinian struggle. Because the United States did not hold a global empire like England\u2019s, leaders warned of national softness once railroads conquered the last continental frontier. As though heeding this warning, ingenious students turned variations on rugby into a toughening agent. Today a plaque in New Brunswick, New Jersey, commemorates the first college game, on November 6, 1869, when Rutgers beat Princeton 6\u20134.\nWalter Camp graduated from Yale in 1880 so intoxicated by the sport that he devoted his life to it without pay, becoming \u201cthe father of American football.\u201d He persuaded other schools to reduce the chaos on the field by trimming each side from 15 players to 11, and it was his idea to paint measuring lines on the field. He conceived functional designations for players, coining terms such as quarterback. His game remained violent by design. Crawlers could push the ball forward beneath piles of flying elbows without pause until they cried \u201cDown!\u201d in submission.\n\nIn an 1892 game against its archrival, Yale, the Harvard football team was the first to deploy a \u201cflying wedge,\u201d based on Napoleon\u2019s surprise concentrations of military force. In an editorial calling for the abolition of the play, The New York Times described it as \u201chalf a ton of bone and muscle coming into collision with a man weighing 160 or 170 pounds,\u201d noting that surgeons often had to be called onto the field. Three years later, the continuing mayhem prompted the Harvard faculty to take the first of two votes to abolish football. Charles Eliot, the university\u2019s president, brought up other concerns. \u201cDeaths and injuries are not the strongest argument against football,\u201d declared Eliot. \u201cThat cheating and brutality are profitable is the main evil.\u201d Still, Harvard football persisted. In 1903, fervent alumni built Harvard Stadium with zero college funds. The team\u2019s first paid head coach, Bill Reid, started in 1905 at nearly twice the average salary for a full professor.\n\nA newspaper story from that year, illustrated with the Grim Reaper laughing on a goalpost, counted 25 college players killed during football season. A fairy-tale version of the founding of the NCAA holds that President Theodore Roosevelt, upset by a photograph of a bloodied Swarthmore College player, vowed to civilize or destroy football. The real story is that Roosevelt maneuvered shrewdly to preserve the sport\u2014and give a boost to his beloved Harvard. After McClure\u2019s magazine published a story on corrupt teams with phantom students, a muckraker exposed Walter Camp\u2019s $100,000 slush fund at Yale. In response to mounting outrage, Roosevelt summoned leaders from Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to the White House, where Camp parried mounting criticism and conceded nothing irresponsible in the college football rules he\u2019d established. At Roosevelt\u2019s behest, the three schools issued a public statement that college sports must reform to survive, and representatives from 68 colleges founded a new organization that would soon be called the National Collegiate Athletic Association. A Haverford College official was confirmed as secretary but then promptly resigned in favor of Bill Reid, the new Harvard coach, who instituted new rules that benefited Harvard\u2019s playing style at the expense of Yale\u2019s. At a stroke, Roosevelt saved football and dethroned Yale.\n\nFor nearly 50 years, the NCAA, with no real authority and no staff to speak of, enshrined amateur ideals that it was helpless to enforce. (Not until 1939 did it gain the power even to mandate helmets.) In 1929, the Carnegie Foundation made headlines with a report, \u201cAmerican College Athletics,\u201d which concluded that the scramble for players had \u201creached the proportions of nationwide commerce.\u201d Of the 112 schools surveyed, 81 flouted NCAA recommendations with inducements to students ranging from open payrolls and disguised booster funds to no-show jobs at movie studios. Fans ignored the uproar, and two-thirds of the colleges mentioned told The New York Times that they planned no changes. In 1939, freshman players at the University of Pittsburgh went on strike because they were getting paid less than their upperclassman teammates.\n\nEmbarrassed, the NCAA in 1948 enacted a \u201cSanity Code,\u201d which was supposed to prohibit all concealed and indirect benefits for college athletes; any money for athletes was to be limited to transparent scholarships awarded solely on financial need. Schools that violated this code would be expelled from NCAA membership and thus exiled from competitive sports.\n\nThis bold effort flopped. Colleges balked at imposing such a drastic penalty on each other, and the Sanity Code was repealed within a few years. The University of Virginia went so far as to call a press conference to say that if its athletes were ever accused of being paid, they should be forgiven, because their studies at Thomas Jefferson\u2019s university were so rigorous.\n\nThe Big Bluff\nIn 1951, the NCAA seized upon a serendipitous set of events to gain control of intercollegiate sports. First, the organization hired a young college dropout named Walter Byers as executive director. A journalist who was not yet 30 years old, he was an appropriately inauspicious choice for the vaguely defined new post. He wore cowboy boots and a toupee. He shunned personal contact, obsessed over details, and proved himself a bureaucratic master of pervasive, anonymous intimidation. Although discharged from the Army during World War II for defective vision, Byers was able to see an opportunity in two contemporaneous scandals. In one, the tiny College of William and Mary, aspiring to challenge football powers Oklahoma and Ohio State, was found to be counterfeiting grades to keep conspicuously pampered players eligible. In the other, a basketball point-shaving conspiracy (in which gamblers paid players to perform poorly) had spread from five New York colleges to the University of Kentucky, the reigning national champion, generating tabloid \u201cperp\u201d photos of gangsters and handcuffed basketball players. The scandals posed a crisis of credibility for collegiate athletics, and nothing in the NCAA\u2019s feeble record would have led anyone to expect real reform.\n\nBut Byers managed to impanel a small infractions board to set penalties without waiting for a full convention of NCAA schools, which would have been inclined toward forgiveness. Then he lobbied a University of Kentucky dean\u2014A. D. Kirwan, a former football coach and future university president\u2014not to contest the NCAA\u2019s dubious legal position (the association had no actual authority to penalize the university), pleading that college sports must do something to restore public support. His gambit succeeded when Kirwan reluctantly accepted a landmark precedent: the Kentucky basketball team would be suspended for the entire 1952\u201353 season. Its legendary coach, Adolph Rupp, fumed for a year in limbo.\n\nThe Kentucky case created an aura of centralized command for an NCAA office that barely existed. At the same time, a colossal misperception gave Byers leverage to mine gold. Amazingly in retrospect, most colleges and marketing experts considered the advent of television a dire threat to sports. Studies found that broadcasts reduced live attendance, and therefore gate receipts, because some customers preferred to watch at home for free. Nobody could yet imagine the revenue bonanza that television represented. With clunky new TV sets proliferating, the 1951 NCAA convention voted 161\u20137 to outlaw televised games except for a specific few licensed by the NCAA staff.\n\nAll but two schools quickly complied. The University of Pennsylvania and Notre Dame protested the order to break contracts for home-game television broadcasts, claiming the right to make their own decisions. Byers objected that such exceptions would invite disaster. The conflict escalated. Byers brandished penalties for games televised without approval. Penn contemplated seeking antitrust protection through the courts. Byers issued a contamination notice, informing any opponent scheduled to play Penn that it would be punished for showing up to compete. In effect, Byers mobilized the college world to isolate the two holdouts in what one sportswriter later called \u201cthe Big Bluff.\u201d\n\nByers won. Penn folded in part because its president, the perennial White House contender Harold Stassen, wanted to mend relations with fellow schools in the emerging Ivy League, which would be formalized in 1954. When Notre Dame also surrendered, Byers conducted exclusive negotiations with the new television networks on behalf of every college team. Joe Rauh Jr., a prominent civil-rights attorney, helped him devise a rationing system to permit only 11 broadcasts a year\u2014the fabled Game of the Week. Byers and Rauh selected a few teams for television exposure, excluding the rest. On June 6, 1952, NBC signed a one-year deal to pay the NCAA $1.14 million for a carefully restricted football package. Byers routed all contractual proceeds through his office. He floated the idea that, to fund an NCAA infrastructure, his organization should take a 60 percent cut; he accepted 12 percent that season. (For later contracts, as the size of television revenues grew exponentially, he backed down to 5 percent.) Proceeds from the first NBC contract were enough to rent an NCAA headquarters, in Kansas City.\n\nOnly one year into his job, Byers had secured enough power and money to regulate all of college sports. Over the next decade, the NCAA\u2019s power grew along with television revenues. Through the efforts of Byers\u2019s deputy and chief lobbyist, Chuck Neinas, the NCAA won an important concession in the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, in which Congress made its granting of a precious antitrust exemption to the National Football League contingent upon the blackout of professional football on Saturdays. Deftly, without even mentioning the NCAA, a rider on the bill carved each weekend into protected broadcast markets: Saturday for college, Sunday for the NFL. The NFL got its antitrust exemption. Byers, having negotiated the NCAA\u2019s television package up to $3.1 million per football season\u2014which was higher than the NFL\u2019s figure in those early years\u2014had made the NCAA into a spectacularly profitable cartel.\n\n\u201cWe Eat What We Kill\u201d\nThe NCAA\u2019s control of college sports still rested on a fragile base, however: the consent of the colleges and universities it governed. For a time, the vast sums of television money delivered to these institutions through Byers\u2019s deals made them willing to submit. But the big football powers grumbled about the portion of the television revenue diverted to nearly a thousand NCAA member schools that lacked major athletic programs. They chafed against cost-cutting measures\u2014such as restrictions on team size\u2014designed to help smaller schools. \u201cI don\u2019t want Hofstra telling Texas how to play football,\u201d Darrell Royal, the Longhorns coach, griped. By the 1970s and \u201980s, as college football games delivered bonanza ratings\u2014and advertising revenue\u2014to the networks, some of the big football schools began to wonder: Why do we need to have our television coverage brokered through the NCAA? Couldn\u2019t we get a bigger cut of that TV money by dealing directly with the networks?\nByers faced a rude internal revolt. The NCAA\u2019s strongest legions, its big football schools, defected en masse. Calling the NCAA a price-fixing cartel that siphoned every television dollar through its coffers, in 1981 a rogue consortium of 61 major football schools threatened to sign an independent contract with NBC for $180 million over four years.\n\nWith a huge chunk of the NCAA\u2019s treasury walking out the door, Byers threatened sanctions, as he had against Penn and Notre Dame three decades earlier. But this time the universities of Georgia and Oklahoma responded with an antitrust suit. \u201cIt is virtually impossible to overstate the degree of our resentment \u2026 of the NCAA,\u201d said William Banowsky, the president of the University of Oklahoma. In the landmark 1984 NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the NCAA\u2019s latest football contracts with television\u2014and any future ones\u2014as an illegal restraint of trade that harmed colleges and viewers. Overnight, the NCAA\u2019s control of the television market for football vanished. Upholding Banowsky\u2019s challenge to the NCAA\u2019s authority, the Regents decision freed the football schools to sell any and all games the markets would bear. Coaches and administrators no longer had to share the revenue generated by their athletes with smaller schools outside the football consortium. \u201cWe eat what we kill,\u201d one official at the University of Texas bragged.\n\nA few years earlier, this blow might have financially crippled the NCAA\u2014but a rising tide of money from basketball concealed the structural damage of the Regents decision. During the 1980s, income from the March Madness college basketball tournament, paid directly by the television networks to the NCAA, grew tenfold. The windfall covered\u2014and then far exceeded\u2014what the organization had lost from football.\n\nStill, Byers never forgave his former deputy Chuck Neinas for leading the rebel consortium. He knew that Neinas had seen from the inside how tenuous the NCAA\u2019s control really was, and how diligently Byers had worked to prop up its Oz-like fa\u00e7ade. During Byers\u2019s tenure, the rule book for Division I athletes grew to 427 pages of scholastic detail. His NCAA personnel manual banned conversations around water coolers, and coffee cups on desks, while specifying exactly when drapes must be drawn at the NCAA\u2019s 27,000-square-foot headquarters near Kansas City (built in 1973 from the proceeds of a 1 percent surtax on football contracts). It was as though, having lost control where it mattered, Byers pedantically exerted more control where it didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter retiring in 1987, Byers let slip his suppressed fury that the ingrate football conferences, having robbed the NCAA of television revenue, still expected it to enforce amateurism rules and police every leak of funds to college players. A lethal greed was \u201cgnawing at the innards of college athletics,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. When Byers renounced the NCAA\u2019s pretense of amateurism, his former colleagues would stare blankly, as though he had gone senile or, as he wrote, \u201cdesecrated my sacred vows.\u201d But Byers was better positioned than anyone else to argue that college football\u2019s claim to amateurism was unfounded. Years later, as we will see, lawyers would seize upon his words to do battle with the NCAA.\n\nMeanwhile, reformers fretted that commercialism was hurting college sports, and that higher education\u2019s historical balance between academics and athletics had been distorted by all the money sloshing around. News stories revealed that schools went to extraordinary measures to keep academically incompetent athletes eligible for competition, and would vie for the most-sought-after high-school players by proffering under-the-table payments. In 1991, the first Knight Commission report, \u201cKeeping Faith With the Student Athlete,\u201d was published; the commission\u2019s \u201cbedrock conviction\u201d was that university presidents must seize control of the NCAA from athletic directors in order to restore the preeminence of academic values over athletic or commercial ones. In response, college presidents did take over the NCAA\u2019s governance. But by 2001, when the second Knight Commission report (\u201cA Call to Action: Reconnecting College Sports and Higher Education\u201d) was issued, a new generation of reformers was admitting that problems of corruption and commercialism had \u201cgrown rather than diminished\u201d since the first report. Meanwhile the NCAA itself, revenues rising, had moved into a $50 million, 116,000-square-foot headquarters in Indianapolis. By 2010, as the size of NCAA headquarters increased yet again with a 130,000-square-foot expansion, a third Knight Commission was groping blindly for a hold on independent college-athletic conferences that were behaving more like sovereign pro leagues than confederations of universities. And still more money continued to flow into NCAA coffers. With the basketball tournament\u2019s 2011 television deal, annual March Madness broadcast revenues had skyrocketed 50-fold in less than 30 years.\n\nThe Myth of the \u201cStudent-Athlete\u201d\nToday, much of the NCAA\u2019s moral authority\u2014indeed much of the justification for its existence\u2014is vested in its claim to protect what it calls the \u201cstudent-athlete.\u201d The term is meant to conjure the nobility of amateurism, and the precedence of scholarship over athletic endeavor. But the origins of the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d lie not in a disinterested ideal but in a sophistic formulation designed, as the sports economist Andrew Zimbalist has written, to help the NCAA in its \u201cfight against workmen\u2019s compensation insurance claims for injured football players.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe crafted the term student-athlete,\u201d Walter Byers himself wrote, \u201cand soon it was embedded in all NCAA rules and interpretations.\u201d The term came into play in the 1950s, when the widow of Ray Dennison, who had died from a head injury received while playing football in Colorado for the Fort Lewis A&M Aggies, filed for workmen\u2019s-compensation death benefits. Did his football scholarship make the fatal collision a \u201cwork-related\u201d accident? Was he a school employee, like his peers who worked part-time as teaching assistants and bookstore cashiers? Or was he a fluke victim of extracurricular pursuits? Given the hundreds of incapacitating injuries to college athletes each year, the answers to these questions had enormous consequences. The Colorado Supreme Court ultimately agreed with the school\u2019s contention that he was not eligible for benefits, since the college was \u201cnot in the football business.\u201d\n\nThe term student-athlete was deliberately ambiguous. College players were not students at play (which might understate their athletic obligations), nor were they just athletes in college (which might imply they were professionals). That they were high-performance athletes meant they could be forgiven for not meeting the academic standards of their peers; that they were students meant they did not have to be compensated, ever, for anything more than the cost of their studies. Student-athlete became the NCAA\u2019s signature term, repeated constantly in and out of courtrooms.\n\nUsing the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d defense, colleges have compiled a string of victories in liability cases. On the afternoon of October 26, 1974, the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs were playing the Alabama Crimson Tide in Birmingham, Alabama. Kent Waldrep, a TCU running back, carried the ball on a \u201cRed Right 28\u201d sweep toward the Crimson Tide\u2019s sideline, where he was met by a swarm of tacklers. When Waldrep regained consciousness, Bear Bryant, the storied Crimson Tide coach, was standing over his hospital bed. \u201cIt was like talking to God, if you\u2019re a young football player,\u201d Waldrep recalled.\n\nWaldrep was paralyzed: he had lost all movement and feeling below his neck. After nine months of paying his medical bills, Texas Christian refused to pay any more, so the Waldrep family coped for years on dwindling charity.\n\nThrough the 1990s, from his wheelchair, Waldrep pressed a lawsuit for workers\u2019 compensation. (He also, through heroic rehabilitation efforts, recovered feeling in his arms, and eventually learned to drive a specially rigged van. \u201cI can brush my teeth,\u201d he told me last year, \u201cbut I still need help to bathe and dress.\u201d) His attorneys haggled with TCU and the state worker-compensation fund over what constituted employment. Clearly, TCU had provided football players with equipment for the job, as a typical employer would\u2014but did the university pay wages, withhold income taxes on his financial aid, or control work conditions and performance? The appeals court finally rejected Waldrep\u2019s claim in June of 2000, ruling that he was not an employee because he had not paid taxes on financial aid that he could have kept even if he quit football. (Waldrep told me school officials \u201csaid they recruited me as a student, not an athlete,\u201d which he says was absurd.)\n\nThe long saga vindicated the power of the NCAA\u2019s \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d formulation as a shield, and the organization continues to invoke it as both a legalistic defense and a noble ideal. Indeed, such is the term\u2019s rhetorical power that it is increasingly used as a sort of reflexive mantra against charges of rabid hypocrisy.\n\nLast Thanksgiving weekend, with both the FBI and the NCAA investigating whether Cam Newton had been lured onto his team with illegal payments, Newton\u2019s Auburn Tigers and the Alabama Crimson Tide came together for their annual game, known as the Iron Bowl, before 101,821 fans at Bryant-Denny Stadium. This game is always a highlight of the football season because of the historic rivalry between the two schools, and the 2010 edition had enormous significance, pitting the defending national champion Crimson Tide against the undefeated Tigers, who were aiming for their first championship since 1957. I expected excited fans; what I encountered was the throbbing heart of college sports. As I drove before daybreak toward the stadium, a sleepless caller babbled over WJOX, the local fan radio station, that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t stop thinking about the coin toss.\u201d In the parking lot, ticketless fans were puzzled that anyone need ask why they had tailgated for days just to watch their satellite-fed flat screens within earshot of the roar. All that morning, pilgrims packed the Bear Bryant museum, where displays elaborated the misery of Alabama\u2019s 4\u201324 run before the glorious Bryant era dawned in 1958.\n\nFinally, as Auburn took the field for warm-ups, one of Alabama\u2019s public-address-system operators played \u201cTake the Money and Run\u201d (an act for which he would be fired). A sea of signs reading $CAM taunted Newton. The game, perhaps the most exciting of the season, was unbearably tense, with Auburn coming from way behind to win 28\u201327, all but assuring that it would go on to play for the national championship. Days later, Auburn suspended Newton after the NCAA found that a rules violation had occurred: his father was alleged to have marketed his son in a pay-for-play scheme; a day after that, the NCAA reinstated Newton\u2019s eligibility because investigators had not found evidence that Newton or Auburn officials had known of his father\u2019s actions. This left Newton conveniently eligible for the Southeastern Conference championship game and for the postseason BCS championship bowl. For the NCAA, prudence meant honoring public demand.\n\n\u201cOur championships,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert has declared, \u201care one of the primary tools we have to enhance the student-athlete experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoremasters\u201d\nNCAA v. Regents left the NCAA devoid of television football revenue and almost wholly dependent on March Madness basketball. It is rich but insecure. Last year, CBS Sports and Turner Broadcasting paid $771 million to the NCAA for television rights to the 2011 men\u2019s basketball tournament alone. That\u2019s three-quarters of a billion dollars built on the backs of amateurs\u2014on unpaid labor. The whole edifice depends on the players\u2019 willingness to perform what is effectively volunteer work. The athletes, and the league officials, are acutely aware of this extraordinary arrangement. William Friday, the former North Carolina president, recalls being yanked from one Knight Commission meeting and sworn to secrecy about what might happen if a certain team made the NCAA championship basketball game. \u201cThey were going to dress and go out on the floor,\u201d Friday told me, \u201cbut refuse to play,\u201d in a wildcat student strike. Skeptics doubted such a diabolical plot. These were college kids\u2014unlikely to second-guess their coaches, let alone forfeit the dream of a championship. Still, it was unnerving to contemplate what hung on the consent of a few young volunteers: several hundred million dollars in television revenue, countless livelihoods, the NCAA budget, and subsidies for sports at more than 1,000 schools. Friday\u2019s informants exhaled when the suspect team lost before the finals.\n\nCognizant of its precarious financial base, the NCAA has in recent years begun to pursue new sources of revenue. Taking its cue from member schools such as Ohio State (which in 2009 bundled all its promotional rights\u2014souvenirs, stadium ads, shoe deals\u2014and outsourced them to the international sports marketer IMG College for a guaranteed $11 million a year), the NCAA began to exploit its vault of college sports on film. For $29.99 apiece, NCAA On Demand offers DVDs of more than 200 memorable contests in men\u2019s ice hockey alone. Video-game technology also allows nostalgic fans to relive and even participate in classic moments of NCAA Basketball. NCAA Football, licensed by the NCAA through IMG College to Electronic Arts, one of the world\u2019s largest video-game manufacturers, reportedly sold 2.5 million copies in 2008. Brit Kirwan, the chancellor of the Maryland university system and a former president at Ohio State, says there were \u201cterrible fights\u201d between the third Knight Commission and the NCAA over the ethics of generating this revenue.\n\nAll of this money ultimately derives from the college athletes whose likenesses are shown in the films or video games. But none of the profits go to them. Last year, Electronic Arts paid more than $35 million in royalties to the NFL players union for the underlying value of names and images in its pro football series\u2014but neither the NCAA nor its affiliated companies paid former college players a nickel. Naturally, as they have become more of a profit center for the NCAA, some of the vaunted \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d have begun to clamor that they deserve a share of those profits. You \u201csee everybody getting richer and richer,\u201d Desmond Howard, who won the 1991 Heisman Trophy while playing for the Michigan Wolverines, told USA Today recently. \u201cAnd you walk around and you can\u2019t put gas in your car? You can\u2019t even fly home to see your parents?\u201d\n\nSome athletes have gone beyond talk. A series of lawsuits quietly making their way through the courts cast a harsh light on the absurdity of the system\u2014and threaten to dislodge the foundations on which the NCAA rests. On July 21, 2009, lawyers for Ed O\u2019Bannon filed a class-action antitrust suit against the NCAA at the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. \u201cOnce you leave your university,\u201d says O\u2019Bannon, who won the John Wooden Award for player of the year in 1995 on UCLA\u2019s national-championship basketball team, \u201cone would think your likeness belongs to you.\u201d The NCAA and UCLA continue to collect money from the sales of videos of him playing. But by NCAA rules, O\u2019Bannon, who today works at a Toyota dealership near Las Vegas, alleges he is still not allowed to share the revenue the NCAA generates from his own image as a college athlete. His suit quickly gathered co-plaintiffs from basketball and football, ex-players featured in NCAA videos and other products. \u201cThe NCAA does not license student-athlete likenesses,\u201d NCAA spokesperson Erik Christianson told The New York Times in response to the suit, \u201cor prevent former student-athletes from attempting to do so. Likewise, to claim the NCAA profits off student-athlete likenesses is also pure fiction.\u201d\n\nThe legal contention centers on Part IV of the NCAA\u2019s \u201cStudent-Athlete Statement\u201d for Division I, which requires every athlete to authorize use of \u201cyour name or picture \u2026 to promote NCAA championships or other NCAA events, activities or programs.\u201d Does this clause mean that athletes clearly renounce personal interest forever? If so, does it actually undermine the NCAA by implicitly recognizing that athletes have a property right in their own performance? Jon King, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, expects the NCAA\u2019s core mission of amateurism to be its \u201clast defense standing.\u201d\n\nIn theory, the NCAA\u2019s passion to protect the noble amateurism of college athletes should prompt it to focus on head coaches in the high-revenue sports\u2014basketball and football\u2014since holding the top official accountable should most efficiently discourage corruption. The problem is that the coaches\u2019 growing power has rendered them, unlike their players, ever more immune to oversight. According to research by Charles Clotfelter, an economist at Duke, the average compensation for head football coaches at public universities, now more than $2 million, has grown 750 percent (adjusted for inflation) since the Regents decision in 1984; that\u2019s more than 20 times the cumulative 32 percent raise for college professors. For top basketball coaches, annual contracts now exceed $4 million, augmented by assorted bonuses, endorsements, country-club memberships, the occasional private plane, and in some cases a negotiated percentage of ticket receipts. (Oregon\u2019s ticket concessions netted former football coach Mike Bellotti an additional $631,000 in 2005.)\n\nThe NCAA rarely tangles with such people, who are apt to fight back and win. When Rick Neuheisel, the head football coach of the Washington Huskies, was punished for petty gambling (in a March Madness pool, as it happened), he sued the NCAA and the university for wrongful termination, collected $4.5 million, and later moved on to UCLA. When the NCAA tried to cap assistant coaches\u2019 entering salary at a mere $16,000, nearly 2,000 of them brought an antitrust suit, Law v. NCAA, and in 1999 settled for $54.5 million. Since then, salaries for assistant coaches have commonly exceeded $200,000, with the top assistants in the SEC averaging $700,000. In 2009, Monte Kiffin, then at the University of Tennessee, became the first assistant coach to reach $1 million, plus benefits.\n\nThe late Myles Brand, who led the NCAA from 2003 to 2009, defended the economics of college sports by claiming that they were simply the result of a smoothly functioning free market. He and his colleagues deflected criticism about the money saturating big-time college sports by focusing attention on scapegoats; in 2010, outrage targeted sports agents. Last year Sports Illustrated published \u201cConfessions of an Agent,\u201d a firsthand account of dealing with high-strung future pros whom the agent and his peers courted with flattery, cash, and tawdry favors. Nick Saban, Alabama\u2019s head football coach, mobilized his peers to denounce agents as a public scourge. \u201cI hate to say this,\u201d he said, \u201cbut how are they any better than a pimp? I have no respect for people who do that to young people. None.\u201d\n\nSaban\u2019s raw condescension contrasts sharply with the lonely penitence from Dale Brown, the retired longtime basketball coach at LSU. \u201cLook at the money we make off predominantly poor black kids,\u201d Brown once reflected. \u201cWe\u2019re the whoremasters.\u201d\n\n\u201cPicayune Rules\u201d\nNCAA officials have tried to assert their dominion\u2014and distract attention from the larger issues\u2014by chasing frantically after petty violations. Tom McMillen, a former member of the Knight Commission who was an All-American basketball player at the University of Maryland, likens these officials to traffic cops in a speed trap, who could flag down almost any passing motorist for prosecution in kangaroo court under a \u201cmaze of picayune rules.\u201d The publicized cases have become convoluted soap operas. At the start of the 2010 football season, A. J. Green, a wide receiver at Georgia, confessed that he\u2019d sold his own jersey from the Independence Bowl the year before, to raise cash for a spring-break vacation. The NCAA sentenced Green to a four-game suspension for violating his amateur status with the illicit profit generated by selling the shirt off his own back. While he served the suspension, the Georgia Bulldogs store continued legally selling replicas of Green\u2019s No. 8 jersey for $39.95 and up.\n\nA few months later, the NCAA investigated rumors that Ohio State football players had benefited from \u201chook-ups on tatts\u201d\u2014that is, that they\u2019d gotten free or underpriced tattoos at an Ohio tattoo parlor in exchange for autographs and memorabilia\u2014a violation of the NCAA\u2019s rule against discounts linked to athletic personae. The NCAA Committee on Infractions imposed five-game suspensions on Terrelle Pryor, Ohio State\u2019s tattooed quarterback, and four other players (some of whom had been found to have sold their Big Ten championship rings and other gear), but did permit them to finish the season and play in the Sugar Bowl. (This summer, in an attempt to satisfy NCAA investigators, Ohio State voluntarily vacated its football wins from last season, as well as its Sugar Bowl victory.) A different NCAA committee promulgated a rule banning symbols and messages in players\u2019 eyeblack\u2014reportedly aimed at Pryor\u2019s controversial gesture of support for the pro quarterback Michael Vick, and at Bible verses inscribed in the eyeblack of the former Florida quarterback Tim Tebow.\n\nThe moral logic is hard to fathom: the NCAA bans personal messages on the bodies of the players, and penalizes players for trading their celebrity status for discounted tattoos\u2014but it codifies precisely how and where commercial insignia from multinational corporations can be displayed on college players, for the financial benefit of the colleges. Last season, while the NCAA investigated him and his father for the recruiting fees they\u2019d allegedly sought, Cam Newton compliantly wore at least 15 corporate logos\u2014one on his jersey, four on his helmet visor, one on each wristband, one on his pants, six on his shoes, and one on the headband he wears under his helmet\u2014as part of Auburn\u2019s $10.6 million deal with Under Armour.\n\n\u201cRestitution\u201d\nObscure NCAA rules have bedeviled Scott Boras, the preeminent sports agent for Major League Baseball stars, in cases that may ultimately prove more threatening to the NCAA than Ed O\u2019Bannon\u2019s antitrust suit. In 2008, Andrew Oliver, a sophomore pitcher for the Oklahoma State Cowboys, had been listed as the 12th-best professional prospect among sophomore players nationally. He decided to dismiss the two attorneys who had represented him out of high school, Robert and Tim Baratta, and retain Boras instead. Infuriated, the Barattas sent a spiteful letter to the NCAA. Oliver didn\u2019t learn about this until the night before he was scheduled to pitch in the regional final for a place in the College World Series, when an NCAA investigator showed up to question him in the presence of lawyers for Oklahoma State. The investigator also questioned his father, Dave, a truck driver.\n\nHad Tim Baratta been present in their home when the Minnesota Twins offered $390,000 for Oliver to sign out of high school? A yes would mean trouble. While the NCAA did not forbid all professional advice\u2014indeed, Baseball America used to publish the names of agents representing draft-likely underclassmen\u2014NCAA Bylaw 12.3.2.1 prohibited actual negotiation with any professional team by an adviser, on pain of disqualification for the college athlete. The questioning lasted past midnight.\n\nJust hours before the game was to start the next day, Oklahoma State officials summoned Oliver to tell him he would not be pitching. Only later did he learn that the university feared that by letting him play while the NCAA adjudicated his case, the university would open not only the baseball team but all other Oklahoma State teams to broad punishment under the NCAA\u2019s \u201crestitution rule\u201d (Bylaw 19.7), under which the NCAA threatens schools with sanctions if they obey any temporary court order benefiting a college athlete, should that order eventually be modified or removed. The baseball coach did not even let his ace tell his teammates the sad news in person. \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s probably not a good idea for you to be at the game,\u2019\u201d Oliver recalls.\n\nThe Olivers went home to Ohio to find a lawyer. Rick Johnson, a solo practitioner specializing in legal ethics, was aghast that the Baratta brothers had turned in their own client to the NCAA, divulging attorney-client details likely to invite wrath upon Oliver. But for the next 15 months, Johnson directed his litigation against the two NCAA bylaws at issue. Judge Tygh M. Tone, of Erie County, came to share his outrage. On February 12, 2009, Tone struck down the ban on lawyers negotiating for student-athletes as a capricious, exploitative attempt by a private association to \u201cdictate to an attorney where, what, how, or when he should represent his client,\u201d violating accepted legal practice in every state. He also struck down the NCAA\u2019s restitution rule as an intimidation that attempted to supersede the judicial system. Finally, Judge Tone ordered the NCAA to reinstate Oliver\u2019s eligibility at Oklahoma State for his junior season, which started several days later.\n\nThe NCAA sought to disqualify Oliver again, with several appellate motions to stay \u201can unprecedented Order purporting to void a fundamental Bylaw.\u201d Oliver did get to pitch that season, but he dropped into the second round of the June 2009 draft, signing for considerably less than if he\u2019d been picked earlier. Now 23, Oliver says sadly that the whole experience \u201cmade me grow up a little quicker.\u201d His lawyer claimed victory. \u201cAndy Oliver is the first college athlete ever to win against the NCAA in court,\u201d said Rick Johnson.\n\nYet the victory was only temporary. Wounded, the NCAA fought back with a vengeance. Its battery of lawyers prepared for a damages trial, ultimately overwhelming Oliver\u2019s side eight months later with an offer to resolve the dispute for $750,000. When Oliver and Johnson accepted, to extricate themselves ahead of burgeoning legal costs, Judge Tone was compelled to vacate his orders as part of the final settlement. This freed NCAA officials to reassert the two bylaws that Judge Tone had so forcefully overturned, and they moved swiftly to ramp up rather than curtail enforcement. First, the NCAA\u2019s Eligibility Center devised a survey for every drafted undergraduate athlete who sought to stay in college another year. The survey asked whether an agent had conducted negotiations. It also requested a signed release waiving privacy rights and authorizing professional teams to disclose details of any interaction to the NCAA Eligibility Center. Second, NCAA enforcement officials went after another Scott Boras client.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays had made the left-handed pitcher James Paxton, of the University of Kentucky, the 37th pick in the 2009 draft. Paxton decided to reject a reported $1 million offer and return to school for his senior year, pursuing a dream to pitch for his team in the College World Series. But then he ran into the new NCAA survey. Had Boras negotiated with the Blue Jays? Boras has denied that he did, but it would have made sense that he had\u2014that was his job, to test the market for his client. But saying so would get Paxton banished under the same NCAA bylaw that had derailed Andrew Oliver\u2019s career. Since Paxton was planning to go back to school and not accept their draft offer, the Blue Jays no longer had any incentive to protect him\u2014indeed, they had every incentive to turn him in. The Blue Jays\u2019 president, by telling reporters that Boras had negotiated on Paxton\u2019s behalf, demonstrated to future recruits and other teams that they could use the NCAA\u2019s rules to punish college players who wasted their draft picks by returning to college. The NCAA\u2019s enforcement staff raised the pressure by requesting to interview Paxton.\n\nThough Paxton had no legal obligation to talk to an investigator, NCAA Bylaw 10.1(j) specified that anything short of complete cooperation could be interpreted as unethical conduct, affecting his amateur status. Under its restitution rule, the NCAA had leverage to compel the University of Kentucky to ensure obedience.\n\nAs the 2010 season approached, Gary Henderson, the Kentucky coach, sorely wanted Paxton, one of Baseball America\u2019s top-ranked players, to return. Rick Johnson, Andrew Oliver\u2019s lawyer, filed for a declaratory judgment on Paxton\u2019s behalf, arguing that the state constitution\u2014plus the university\u2019s code of student conduct\u2014barred arbitrary discipline at the request of a third party. Kentucky courts deferred to the university, however, and Paxton was suspended from the team. \u201cDue to the possibility of future penalties, including forfeiture of games,\u201d the university stated, it \u201ccould not put the other 32 players of the team and the entire UK 22-sport intercollegiate athletics department at risk by having James compete.\u201d The NCAA appraised the result with satisfaction. \u201cWhen negotiations occur on behalf of student-athletes,\u201d Erik Christianson, the NCAA spokesperson, told The New York Times in reference to the Oliver case, \u201cthose negotiations indicate that the student-athlete intends to become a professional athlete and no longer remain an amateur.\u201d\n\nPaxton was stranded. Not only could he not play for Kentucky, but his draft rights with the Blue Jays had lapsed for the year, meaning he could not play for any minor-league affiliate of Major League Baseball. Boras wrangled a holdover job for him in Texas with the independent Grand Prairie AirHogs, pitching against the Pensacola Pelicans and Wichita Wingnuts. Once projected to be a first-round draft pick, Paxton saw his stock plummet into the fourth round. He remained unsigned until late in spring training, when he signed with the Seattle Mariners and reported to their minor-league camp in Peoria, Arizona.\n\n\u201cYou Might As Well Shoot Them in the Head\u201d\n\u201cWhen you dream about playing in college,\u201d Joseph Agnew told me not long ago, \u201cyou don\u2019t ever think about being in a lawsuit.\u201d Agnew, a student at Rice University in Houston, had been cut from the football team and had his scholarship revoked by Rice before his senior year, meaning that he faced at least $35,000 in tuition and other bills if he wanted to complete his degree in sociology. Bereft of his scholarship, he was flailing about for help when he discovered the National College Players Association, which claims 7,000 active members and seeks modest reforms such as safety guidelines and better death benefits for college athletes. Agnew was struck by the NCPA scholarship data on players from top Division I basketball teams, which showed that 22 percent were not renewed from 2008 to 2009\u2014the same fate he had suffered.\n\nIn October 2010, Agnew filed a class-action antitrust suit over the cancellation of his scholarship and to remove the cap on the total number of scholarships that can be awarded by NCAA schools. In his suit, Agnew did not claim the right to free tuition. He merely asked the federal court to strike down an NCAA rule, dating to 1973, that prohibited colleges and universities from offering any athletic scholarship longer than a one-year commitment, to be renewed or not, unilaterally, by the school\u2014which in practice means that coaches get to decide each year whose scholarships to renew or cancel. (After the coach who had recruited Agnew had moved on to Tulsa, the new Rice coach switched Agnew\u2019s scholarship to a recruit of his own.) Agnew argued that without the one-year rule, he would have been free to bargain with all eight colleges that had recruited him, and each college could have decided how long to guarantee his scholarship.\n\nAgnew\u2019s suit rested on a claim of an NCAA antitrust violation combined with a laudable academic goal\u2014making it possible for students to finish their educations. Around the same time, lawyers from President Obama\u2019s Justice Department initiated a series of meetings with NCAA officials and universities in which they asked what possible educational rationale there was for allowing the NCAA\u2014an organization that did not itself pay for scholarships\u2014to impose a blanket restriction on the length of scholarships offered by colleges. Tidbits leaked into the press. In response, the NCAA contended that an athletic scholarship was a \u201cmerit award\u201d that should be reviewed annually, presumably because the degree of \u201cmerit\u201d could change. Justice Department lawyers reportedly suggested that a free market in scholarships would expand learning opportunities in accord with the stated rationale for the NCAA\u2019s tax-exempt status\u2014that it promotes education through athletics. The one-year rule effectively allows colleges to cut underperforming \u201cstudent-athletes,\u201d just as pro sports teams cut their players. \u201cPlenty of them don\u2019t stay in school,\u201d said one of Agnew\u2019s lawyers, Stuart Paynter. \u201cThey\u2019re just gone. You might as well shoot them in the head.\u201d\n\nAgnew\u2019s lawsuit has made him a pariah to former friends in the athletic department at Rice, where everyone identified so thoroughly with the NCAA that they seemed to feel he was attacking them personally. But if the premise of Agnew\u2019s case is upheld by the courts, it will make a sham of the NCAA\u2019s claim that its highest priority is protecting education.\n\n\u201cThey Want to Crush These Kids\u201d\nAcademic performance has always been difficult for the NCAA to address. Any detailed regulation would intrude upon the free choice of widely varying schools, and any academic standard broad enough to fit both MIT and Ole Miss would have little force. From time to time, a scandal will expose extreme lapses. In 1989, Dexter Manley, by then the famous \u201cSecretary of Defense\u201d for the NFL\u2019s Washington Redskins, teared up before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Education, Arts, and Humanities, when admitting that he had been functionally illiterate in college.\n\nWithin big-time college athletic departments, the financial pressure to disregard obvious academic shortcomings and shortcuts is just too strong. In the 1980s, Jan Kemp, an English instructor at the University of Georgia, publicly alleged that university officials had demoted and then fired her because she refused to inflate grades in her remedial English courses. Documents showed that administrators replaced the grades she\u2019d given athletes with higher ones, providing fake passing grades on one notable occasion to nine Bulldog football players who otherwise would have been ineligible to compete in the 1982 Sugar Bowl. (Georgia lost anyway, 24\u201320, to a University of Pittsburgh team led by the future Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino.) When Kemp filed a lawsuit against the university, she was publicly vilified as a troublemaker, but she persisted bravely in her testimony. Once, Kemp said, a supervisor demanding that she fix a grade had bellowed, \u201cWho do you think is more important to this university, you or Dominique Wilkins?\u201d (Wilkins was a star on the basketball team.) Traumatized, Kemp twice attempted suicide.\n\nIn trying to defend themselves, Georgia officials portrayed Kemp as naive about sports. \u201cWe have to compete on a level playing field,\u201d said Fred Davison, the university president. During the Kemp civil trial, in 1986, Hale Almand, Georgia\u2019s defense lawyer, explained the university\u2019s patronizing aspirations for its typical less-than-scholarly athlete. \u201cWe may not make a university student out of him,\u201d Almand told the court, \u201cbut if we can teach him to read and write, maybe he can work at the post office rather than as a garbage man when he gets through with his athletic career.\u201d This argument backfired with the jurors: finding in favor of Kemp, they rejected her polite request for $100,000, and awarded her $2.6 million in damages instead. (This was later reduced to $1.08 million.) Jan Kemp embodied what is ostensibly the NCAA\u2019s reason for being\u2014to enforce standards fairly and put studies above sports\u2014but no one from the organization ever spoke up on her behalf.\n\nTHE NCAA BODY charged with identifying violations of any of the Division I league rules, the Committee on Infractions, operates in the shadows. Josephine Potuto, a professor of law at the University of Nebraska and a longtime committee member who was then serving as its vice chair, told Congress in 2004 that one reason her group worked in secret was that it hoped to avoid a \u201cmedia circus.\u201d The committee preferred to deliberate in private, she said, guiding member schools to punish themselves. \u201cThe enforcement process is cooperative, not adversarial,\u201d Potuto testified. The committee consisted of an elite coterie of judges, athletic directors, and authors of legal treatises. \u201cThe committee also is savvy about intercollegiate athletics,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cannot be conned.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, a series of unlikely circumstances peeled back the veil of secrecy to reveal NCAA procedures so contorted that even victims marveled at their comical wonder. The saga began in March of 2007, shortly after the Florida State Seminoles basketball team was knocked out of the NIT basketball tournament, which each spring invites the best teams not selected for the March Madness tournament. At an athletic-department study hall, Al Thornton, a star forward for the team, completed a sports-psychology quiz but then abandoned it without posting his written answers electronically by computer. Brenda Monk, an academic tutor for the Seminoles, says she noticed the error and asked a teammate to finish entering Thornton\u2019s answers onscreen and hit \u201csubmit,\u201d as required for credit. The teammate complied, steaming silently, and then complained at the athletic office about getting stuck with clean-up chores for the superstar Thornton (who was soon to be selected by the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the NBA draft). Monk promptly resigned when questioned by FSU officials, saying her fatigue at the time could not excuse her asking the teammate to submit the answers to another student\u2019s completed test.\n\nMonk\u2019s act of guileless responsibility set off a chain reaction. First, FSU had to give the NCAA preliminary notice of a confessed academic fraud. Second, because this would be its seventh major infraction case since 1968, FSU mounted a vigorous self-investigation to demonstrate compliance with NCAA academic rules. Third, interviews with 129 Seminoles athletes unleashed a nightmare of matter-of-fact replies about absentee professors who allowed group consultations and unlimited retakes of open-computer assignments and tests. Fourth, FSU suspended 61 of its athletes in 10 sports. Fifth, the infractions committee applied the byzantine NCAA bylaws to FSU\u2019s violations. Sixth, one of the penalties announced in March of 2009 caused a howl of protest across the sports universe.\n\nTwenty-seven news organizations filed a lawsuit in hopes of finding out how and why the NCAA proposed to invalidate 14 prior victories in FSU football. Such a penalty, if upheld, would doom coach Bobby Bowden\u2019s chance of overtaking Joe Paterno of Penn State for the most football wins in Division I history. This was sacrosanct territory. Sports reporters followed the litigation for six months, reporting that 25 of the 61 suspended FSU athletes were football players, some of whom were ruled ineligible retroactively from the time they had heard or yelled out answers to online test questions in, of all things, a music-appreciation course.\n\nWhen reporters sought access to the transcript of the infractions committee\u2019s hearing in Indianapolis, NCAA lawyers said the 695-page document was private. (The NCAA claimed it was entitled to keep all such records secret because of a landmark Supreme Court ruling that it had won in 1988, in NCAA v. Tarkanian, which exempted the organization from any due-process obligations because it was not a government organization.) Media outlets pressed the judge to let Florida State share its own copy of the hearing transcript, whereupon NCAA lawyers objected that the school had never actually \u201cpossessed\u201d the document; it had only seen the transcript via a defendant\u2019s guest access to the carefully restricted NCAA Web site. This claim, in turn, prompted intercession on the side of the media by Florida\u2019s attorney general, arguing that letting the NCAA use a technical loophole like this would undermine the state\u2019s sunshine law mandating open public records. After tumultuous appeals, the Florida courts agreed and ordered the NCAA transcript released in October of 2009.\n\nNews interest quickly evaporated when the sports media found nothing in the record about Coach Bowden or the canceled football victories. But the transcript revealed plenty about the NCAA. On page 37, T. K. Wetherell, the bewildered Florida State president, lamented that his university had hurt itself by cooperating with the investigation. \u201cWe self-reported this case,\u201d he said during the hearing, and he later complained that the most ingenuous athletes\u2014those who asked \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal, this happens all the time?\u201d\u2014received the harshest suspensions, while those who clammed up on the advice of lawyers went free. The music-appreciation professor was apparently never questioned. Brenda Monk, the only instructor who consistently cooperated with the investigation, appeared voluntarily to explain her work with learning-disabled athletes, only to be grilled about her credentials by Potuto in a pettifogging inquisition of remarkable stamina.\n\nIn January of last year, the NCAA\u2019s Infractions Appeals Committee sustained all the sanctions imposed on FSU except the number of vacated football victories, which it dropped, ex cathedra, from 14 to 12. The final penalty locked Bobby Bowden\u2019s official win total on retirement at 377 instead of 389, behind Joe Paterno\u2019s 401 (and counting). This carried stinging symbolism for fans, without bringing down on the NCAA the harsh repercussions it would have risked if it had issued a television ban or substantial fine.\n\nCruelly, but typically, the NCAA concentrated public censure on powerless scapegoats. A dreaded \u201cshow cause\u201d order rendered Brenda Monk, the tutor, effectively unhirable at any college in the United States. Cloaking an old-fashioned blackball in the stately language of law, the order gave notice that any school hiring Monk before a specified date in 2013 \u201cshall, pursuant to the provisions of Bylaw 19.5.2.2(l), show cause why it should not be penalized if it does not restrict the former learning specialist [Monk] from having any contact with student-athletes.\u201d Today she works as an education supervisor at a prison in Florida.\n\nTHE FLORIDA STATE verdict hardly surprised Rick Johnson, the lawyer who had represented the college pitchers Andrew Oliver and James Paxton. \u201cAll the NCAA\u2019s enforcements are random and selective,\u201d he told me, calling the organization\u2019s appeals process a travesty. (Johnson says the NCAA has never admitted to having wrongly suspended an athlete.) Johnson\u2019s scalding experience prompted him to undertake a law-review article on the subject, which in turn sent him trawling through NCAA archives. From the summary tax forms required of nonprofits, he found out that the NCAA had spent nearly $1 million chartering private jets in 2006. \u201cWhat kind of nonprofit organization leases private jets?,\u201d Johnson asks. It\u2019s hard to determine from tax returns what money goes where, but it looks as if the NCAA spent less than 1 percent of its budget on enforcement that year. Even after its plump cut for its own overhead, the NCAA dispersed huge sums to its 1,200 member schools, in the manner of a professional sports league. These annual payments are universal\u2014every college gets something\u2014but widely uneven. They keep the disparate shareholders (barely) united and speaking for all of college sports. The payments coerce unity within the structure of a private association that is unincorporated and unregulated, exercising amorphous powers not delegated by any government.\n\nSearching through the archives, Johnson came across a 1973 memo from the NCAA general counsel recommending the adoption of a due-process procedure for athletes in disciplinary cases. Without it, warned the organization\u2019s lawyer, the association risked big liability claims for deprivation of rights. His proposal went nowhere. Instead, apparently to limit costs to the universities, Walter Byers had implemented the year-by-year scholarship rule that Joseph Agnew would challenge in court 37 years later. Moreover, the NCAA\u2019s 1975 convention adopted a second recommendation \u201cto discourage legal actions against the NCAA,\u201d according to the minutes. The members voted to create Bylaw 19.7, Restitution, to intimidate college athletes in disputes with the NCAA. Johnson recognized this provision all too well, having won the temporary court judgment that the rule was illegal if not downright despotic. It made him nearly apoplectic to learn that the NCAA had deliberately drawn up the restitution rule as an obstacle to due process, contrary to the recommendation of its own lawyer. \u201cThey want to crush these kids,\u201d he says.\n\nThe NCAA, of course, has never expressed such a desire, and its public comments on due process tend to be anodyne. At a congressional hearing in 2004, the infractions-committee vice chair, Josephine Potuto, repeatedly argued that although the NCAA is \u201cnot bound by any judicial due process standards,\u201d its enforcement, infractions, and hearing procedures meet and \u201cvery likely exceed\u201d those of other public institutions. Yet when pressed, Potuto declared that athletes would have no standing for due process even if the Supreme Court had not exempted the NCAA in the 1988 Tarkanian decision. \u201cIn order to reach due-process issues as a legal Constitutional principle, the individual challenging has to have a substantive property or liberty interest,\u201d she testified. \u201cThe opportunity to play intercollegiate athletics does not rise to that level.\u201d\n\nTo translate this from the legal jargon, Potuto used a circular argument to confine college athletes beneath any right to freedom or property in their own athletic effort. They have no stake to seek their rights, she claimed, because they have no rights at stake.\n\nPotuto\u2019s assertion might be judged preposterous, an heir of the Dred Scott dictum that slaves possessed no rights a white person was bound to respect. But she was merely being honest, articulating assumptions almost everyone shares without question. Whether motivated by hostility for students (as critics like Johnson allege), or by noble and paternalistic tough love (as the NCAA professes), the denial of fundamental due process for college athletes has stood unchallenged in public discourse. Like other NCAA rules, it emanates naturally from the premise that college athletes own no interest in sports beyond exercise, character-building, and good fun. Who represents these young men and women? No one asks.\n\nThe debates and commissions about reforming college sports nibble around the edges\u2014trying to reduce corruption, to prevent the \u201ccontamination\u201d of athletes by lucre, and to maintain at least a pretense of concern for academic integrity. Everything stands on the implicit presumption that preserving amateurism is necessary for the well-being of college athletes. But while amateurism\u2014and the free labor it provides\u2014may be necessary to the preservation of the NCAA, and perhaps to the profit margins of various interested corporations and educational institutions, what if it doesn\u2019t benefit the athletes? What if it hurts them?\n\n\u201cThe Plantation Mentality\u201d\n\u201cNinety percent of the NCAA revenue is produced by 1 percent of the athletes,\u201d Sonny Vaccaro says. \u201cGo to the skill positions\u201d\u2014the stars. \u201cNinety percent African Americans.\u201d The NCAA made its money off those kids, and so did he. They were not all bad people, the NCAA officials, but they were blind, Vaccaro believes. \u201cTheir organization is a fraud.\u201d\n\nVaccaro retired from Reebok in 2007 to make a clean break for a crusade. \u201cThe kids and their parents gave me a good life,\u201d he says in his peppery staccato. \u201cI want to give something back.\u201d Call it redemption, he told me. Call it education or a good cause. \u201cHere\u2019s what I preach,\u201d said Vaccaro. \u201cThis goes beyond race, to human rights. The least educated are the most exploited. I\u2019m probably closer to the kids than anyone else, and I\u2019m 71 years old.\u201d\n\nVaccaro is officially an unpaid consultant to the plaintiffs in O\u2019Bannon v. NCAA. He connected Ed O\u2019Bannon with the attorneys who now represent him, and he talked to some of the additional co-plaintiffs who have joined the suit, among them Oscar Robertson, a basketball Hall of Famer who was incensed that the NCAA was still selling his image on playing cards 50 years after he left the University of Cincinnati.\n\nJon King, an antitrust lawyer at Hausfeld LLP in San Francisco, told me that Vaccaro \u201copened our eyes to massive revenue streams hidden in college sports.\u201d King and his colleagues have drawn on Vaccaro\u2019s vast knowledge of athletic-department finances, which include off-budget accounts for shoe contracts. Sonny Vaccaro and his wife, Pam, \u201chad a mountain of documents,\u201d he said. The outcome of the 1984 Regents decision validated an antitrust approach for O\u2019Bannon, King argues, as well as for Joseph Agnew in his continuing case against the one-year scholarship rule. Lawyers for Sam Keller\u2014a former quarterback for the University of Nebraska who is featured in video games\u2014are pursuing a parallel \u201cright of publicity\u201d track based on the First Amendment. Still other lawyers could revive Rick Johnson\u2019s case against NCAA bylaws on a larger scale, and King thinks claims for the rights of college players may be viable also under laws pertaining to contracts, employment, and civil rights.\n\nVaccaro had sought a law firm for O\u2019Bannon with pockets deep enough to withstand an expensive war of attrition, fearing that NCAA officials would fight discovery to the end. So far, though, they have been forthcoming. \u201cThe numbers are off the wall,\u201d Vaccaro says. \u201cThe public will see for the first time how all the money is distributed.\u201d\n\nVaccaro has been traveling the after-dinner circuit, proselytizing against what he sees as the NCAA\u2019s exploitation of young athletes. Late in 2008, someone who heard his stump speech at Howard University mentioned it to Michael Hausfeld, a prominent antitrust and human-rights lawyer, whose firm had won suits against Exxon for Native Alaskans and against Union Bank of Switzerland for Holocaust victims\u2019 families. Someone tracked down Vaccaro on vacation in Athens, Greece, and he flew back directly to meet Hausfeld. The shoe salesman and the white-shoe lawyer made common cause.\n\nHausfeld LLP has offices in San Francisco, Philadelphia, and London. Its headquarters are on K Street in Washington, D.C., about three blocks from the White House. When I talked with Hausfeld there not long ago, he sat in a cavernous conference room, tidy in pinstripes, hands folded on a spotless table that reflected the skyline. He spoke softly, without pause, condensing the complex fugue of antitrust litigation into simple sentences. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the basic question,\u201d he said, noting that the NCAA claims that student-athletes have no property rights in their own athletic accomplishments. Yet, in order to be eligible to play, college athletes have to waive their rights to proceeds from any sales based on their athletic performance.\n\n\u201cWhat right is it that they\u2019re waiving?,\u201d Hausfeld asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t waive something you don\u2019t have. So they had a right that they gave up in consideration to the principle of amateurism, if there be such.\u201d (At an April hearing in a U.S. District Court in California, Gregory Curtner, a representative for the NCAA, stunned O\u2019Bannon\u2019s lawyers by saying: \u201cThere is no document, there is no substance, that the NCAA ever takes from the student-athletes their rights of publicity or their rights of likeness. They are at all times owned by the student-athlete.\u201d Jon King says this is \u201clike telling someone they have the winning lottery ticket, but by the way, it can only be cashed in on Mars.\u201d The court denied for a second time an NCAA motion to dismiss the O\u2019Bannon complaint.)\n\nThe waiver clause is nestled among the paragraphs of the \u201cStudent-Athlete Statement\u201d that NCAA rules require be collected yearly from every college athlete. In signing the statement, the athletes attest that they have amateur status, that their stated SAT scores are valid, that they are willing to disclose any educational documents requested, and so forth. Already, Hausfeld said, the defendants in the Ed O\u2019Bannon case have said in court filings that college athletes thereby transferred their promotional rights forever. He paused. \u201cThat\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody assigns rights like that. Nobody can assert rights like that.\u201d He said the pattern demonstrated clear abuse by the collective power of the schools and all their conferences under the NCAA umbrella\u2014\u201ca most effective cartel.\u201d\n\nThe faux ideal of amateurism is \u201cthe elephant in the room,\u201d Hausfeld said, sending for a book. \u201cYou can\u2019t get to the bottom of our case without exposing the hypocrisy of amateurism, and Walter Byers says it eloquently.\u201d An assistant brought in Byers\u2019s memoir. It looked garish on the shiny table because dozens of pink Post-its protruded from the text. Hausfeld read to me from page 390:\n\nThe college player cannot sell his own feet (the coach does that) nor can he sell his own name (the college will do that). This is the plantation mentality resurrected and blessed by today\u2019s campus executives.\nHe looked up. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the NCAA\u2019s architect.\u201d He found a key recommendation on page 388:\n\nProsecutors and the courts, with the support of the public, should use antitrust laws to break up the collegiate cartel\u2014not just in athletics but possibly in other aspects of collegiate life as well.\nCould the book become evidence? Might the aged Byers testify? (He is now 89.) Was that part of the plaintiffs\u2019 strategy for the O\u2019Bannon trial? Hausfeld smiled faintly. \u201cI\u2019d rather the NCAA lawyers not fully understand the strategy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe put the spiny book away and previewed what lies ahead. The court soon would qualify his clients as a class. Then the Sherman Antitrust Act would provide for thorough discovery to break down exactly what the NCAA receives on everything from video clips to jerseys, contract by contract. \u201cAnd we want to know what they\u2019re carrying on their books as the value of their archival footage,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThey say it\u2019s a lot of money. We agree. How much?\u201d\n\nThe work will be hard, but Hausfeld said he will win in the courts, unless the NCAA folds first. \u201cWhy?\u201d Hausfeld asked rhetorically. \u201cWe know our clients are foreclosed: neither the NCAA nor its members will permit them to participate in any of that licensing revenue. Under the law, it\u2019s up to them [the defendants] to give a pro-competitive justification. They can\u2019t. End of story.\u201d\n\nIN 2010 THE third Knight Commission, complementing a previous commission\u2019s recommendation for published reports on academic progress, called for the finances of college sports to be made transparent and public\u2014television contracts, conference budgets, shoe deals, coaches\u2019 salaries, stadium bonds, everything. The recommendation was based on the worthy truism that sunlight is a proven disinfectant. But in practice, it has not been applied at all. Conferences, coaches, and other stakeholders resisted disclosure; college players still have no way of determining their value to the university.\n\n\u201cMoney surrounds college sports,\u201d says Domonique Foxworth, who is a cornerback for the NFL\u2019s Baltimore Ravens and an executive-committee member for the NFL Players Association, and played for the University of Maryland. \u201cAnd every player knows those millions are floating around only because of the 18-to-22-year-olds.\u201d Yes, he told me, even the second-string punter believes a miracle might lift him into the NFL, and why not? In all the many pages of the three voluminous Knight Commission reports, there is but one paragraph that addresses the real-life choices for college athletes. \u201cApproximately 1 percent of NCAA men\u2019s basketball players and 2 percent of NCAA football players are drafted by NBA or NFL teams,\u201d stated the 2001 report, basing its figures on a review of the previous 10 years, \u201cand just being drafted is no assurance of a successful professional career.\u201d Warning that the odds against professional athletic success are \u201castronomically high,\u201d the Knight Commission counsels college athletes to avoid a \u201crude surprise\u201d and to stick to regular studies. This is sound advice as far as it goes, but it\u2019s a bromide that pinches off discussion. Nothing in the typical college curriculum teaches a sweat-stained guard at Clemson or Purdue what his monetary value to the university is. Nothing prods students to think independently about amateurism\u2014because the universities themselves have too much invested in its preservation. Stifling thought, the universities, in league with the NCAA, have failed their own primary mission by providing an empty, cynical education on college sports.\n\nThe most basic reform would treat the students as what they are\u2014adults, with rights and reason of their own\u2014and grant them a meaningful voice in NCAA deliberations. A restoration of full citizenship to \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d would facilitate open governance, making it possible to enforce pledges of transparency in both academic standards and athletic finances. Without that, the NCAA has no effective checks and balances, no way for the students to provide informed consent regarding the way they are governed. A thousand questions lie willfully silenced because the NCAA is naturally afraid of giving \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d a true voice. Would college players be content with the augmented scholarship or allowance now requested by the National College Players Association? If a player\u2019s worth to the university is greater than the value of his scholarship (as it clearly is in some cases), should he be paid a salary? If so, would teammates in revenue sports want to be paid equally, or in salaries stratified according to talent or value on the field? What would the athletes want in Division III, where athletic budgets keep rising without scholarships or substantial sports revenue? Would athletes seek more or less variance in admissions standards? Should non-athletes also have a voice, especially where involuntary student fees support more and more of college sports? Might some schools choose to specialize, paying players only in elite leagues for football, or lacrosse? In athletic councils, how much would high-revenue athletes value a simple thank you from the tennis or field-hockey players for the newly specified subsidies to their facilities?\n\nUniversity administrators, already besieged from all sides, do not want to even think about such questions. Most cringe at the thought of bargaining with athletes as a general manager does in professional sports, with untold effects on the budgets for coaches and every other sports item. \u201cI would not want to be part of it,\u201d North Carolina Athletic Director Dick Baddour told me flatly. After 44 years at UNC, he could scarcely contemplate a world without amateur rules. \u201cWe would have to think long and hard,\u201d Baddour added gravely, \u201cabout whether this university would continue those sports at all.\u201d\n\nI, too, once reflexively recoiled at the idea of paying college athletes and treating them like employees or professionals. It feels abhorrent\u2014but for reasons having to do more with sentiment than with practicality or law. Not just fans and university presidents but judges have often found cursory, non-statutory excuses to leave amateur traditions intact. \u201cEven in the increasingly commercial modern world,\u201d said a federal-court judge in Gaines v. NCAA in 1990, \u201cthis Court believes there is still validity to the Athenian concept of a complete education derived from fostering the full growth of both mind and body.\u201d The fact that \u201cthe NCAA has not distilled amateurism to its purest form,\u201d said the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1988, \u201cdoes not mean its attempts to maintain a mixture containing some amateur elements are unreasonable.\u201d\n\nBut one way or another, the smokescreen of amateurism may soon be swept away. For one thing, a victory by the plaintiffs in O\u2019Bannon\u2019s case would radically transform college sports. Colleges would likely have to either stop profiting from students or start paying them. The NCAA could also be forced to pay tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars in damages. If O\u2019Bannon and Vaccaro and company win, \u201cit will turn college sports on its ear,\u201d said Richard Lapchick, the president of the National Consortium for Academics and Sports, in a recent interview with The New York Times.\n\nThough the O\u2019Bannon case may take several years yet to reach resolution, developments on other fronts are chipping away at amateurism, and at the NCAA. This past summer, Sports Illustrated editorialized in favor of allowing college athletes to be paid by non-university sources without jeopardizing their eligibility. At a press conference last June, Steve Spurrier, the coach of the South Carolina Gamecocks football team (and the winner of the 1966 Heisman Trophy as a Florida Gator), proposed that coaches start paying players $300 a game out of their own pockets. The coaches at six other SEC schools (Alabama, Florida, Ole Miss, Mississippi State, LSU, and Tennessee) all endorsed Spurrier\u2019s proposal. And Mark Emmert, the NCAA president, recently conceded that big changes must come. \u201cThe integrity of collegiate athletics is seriously challenged today by rapidly growing pressures coming from many directions,\u201d Emmert said in July. \u201cWe have reached a point where incremental change is not sufficient to meet these challenges. I want us to act more aggressively and in a more comprehensive way than we have in the past. A few new tweaks of the rules won\u2019t get the job done.\u201d\n\nThreats to NCAA dominion also percolate in Congress. Aggrieved legislators have sponsored numerous bills. Senator Orrin Hatch, citing mistreatment of his Utah Utes, has called witnesses to discuss possible antitrust remedies for the Bowl Championship Series. Congressional committees have already held hearings critical of the NCAA\u2019s refusal to follow due process in disciplinary matters; other committees have explored a rise in football concussions. Last January, calls went up to investigate \u201cinformal\u201d football workouts at the University of Iowa just after the season-ending bowl games\u2014workouts so grueling that 41 of the 56 amateur student-athletes collapsed, and 13 were hospitalized with rhabdomyolysis, a life-threatening kidney condition often caused by excessive exercise.\n\nThe greatest threat to the viability of the NCAA may come from its member universities. Many experts believe that the churning instability within college football will drive the next major change. President Obama himself has endorsed the drumbeat cry for a national playoff in college football. This past spring, the Justice Department questioned the BCS about its adherence to antitrust standards. Jim Delany, the commissioner of the Big Ten, has estimated that a national playoff system could produce three or four times as much money as the existing bowl system does. If a significant band of football schools were to demonstrate that they could orchestrate a true national playoff, without the NCAA\u2019s assistance, the association would be terrified\u2014and with good reason. Because if the big sports colleges don\u2019t need the NCAA to administer a national playoff in football, then they don\u2019t need it to do so in basketball. In which case, they could cut out the middleman in March Madness and run the tournament themselves. Which would deprive the NCAA of close to $1 billion a year, more than 95 percent of its revenue. The organization would be reduced to a rule book without money\u2014an organization aspiring to enforce its rules but without the financial authority to enforce anything.\n\nThus the playoff dreamed of and hankered for by millions of football fans haunts the NCAA. \u201cThere will be some kind of playoff in college football, and it will not be run by the NCAA,\u201d says Todd Turner, a former athletic director in four conferences (Big East, ACC, SEC, and Pac-10). \u201cIf I\u2019m at the NCAA, I have to worry that the playoff group can get basketball to break away, too.\u201d\n\nThis danger helps explain why the NCAA steps gingerly in enforcements against powerful colleges. To alienate member colleges would be to jeopardize its own existence. Long gone are television bans and the \u201cdeath penalty\u201d sentences (commanding season-long shutdowns of offending teams) once meted out to Kentucky (1952), Southwestern Louisiana (1973), and Southern Methodist University (1987). Institutions receive mostly symbolic slaps nowadays. Real punishments fall heavily on players and on scapegoats like literacy tutors.\n\nA deeper reason explains why, in its predicament, the NCAA has no recourse to any principle or law that can justify amateurism. There is no such thing. Scholars and sportswriters yearn for grand juries to ferret out every forbidden bauble that reaches a college athlete, but the NCAA\u2019s ersatz courts can only masquerade as public authority. How could any statute impose amateur status on college athletes, or on anyone else? No legal definition of amateur exists, and any attempt to create one in enforceable law would expose its repulsive and unconstitutional nature\u2014a bill of attainder, stripping from college athletes the rights of American citizenship.\n\nFOR ALL OUR queasiness about what would happen if some athletes were to get paid, there is a successful precedent for the professionalization of an amateur sports system: the Olympics. For years, Walter Byers waged war with the NCAA\u2019s older and more powerful nemesis, the Amateur Athletic Union, which since 1894 had overseen U.S. Olympic athletes. Run in high-handed fashion, the AAU had infamously banned Jesse Owens for life in 1936\u2014weeks after his four heroic gold medals punctured the Nazi claim of Aryan supremacy\u2014because instead of using his sudden fame to tour and make money for the AAU at track meets across Europe, he came home early. In the early 1960s, the fights between the NCAA and the AAU over who should manage Olympic athletes become so bitter that President Kennedy called in General Douglas MacArthur to try to mediate a truce before the Tokyo Olympic Games.\n\nUltimately, Byers prevailed and effectively neutered the AAU. In November 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed the bipartisan Amateur Sports Act. Amateurism in the Olympics soon dissolved\u2014and the world did not end. Athletes, granted a 20 percent voting stake on every Olympic sport\u2019s governing body, tipped balances in the United States and then inexorably around the world. First in marathon races, then in tennis tournaments, players soon were allowed to accept prize money and keep their Olympic eligibility. Athletes profited from sponsorships and endorsements. The International Olympic Committee expunged the word amateur from its charter in 1986. Olympic officials, who had once disdained the NCAA for offering scholarships in exchange for athletic performance, came to welcome millionaire athletes from every quarter, while the NCAA still refused to let the pro Olympian Michael Phelps swim for his college team at Michigan.\n\nThis sweeping shift left the Olympic reputation intact, and perhaps improved. Only hardened romantics mourned the amateur code. \u201cHey, come on,\u201d said Anne Audain, a track-and-field star who once held the world record for the 5,000 meters. \u201cIt\u2019s like losing your virginity. You\u2019re a little misty for awhile, but then you realize, Wow, there\u2019s a whole new world out there!\u201d\n\nWithout logic or practicality or fairness to support amateurism, the NCAA\u2019s final retreat is to sentiment. The Knight Commission endorsed its heartfelt cry that to pay college athletes would be \u201can unacceptable surrender to despair.\u201d Many of the people I spoke with while reporting this article felt the same way. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay college players,\u201d said Wade Smith, a tough criminal lawyer and former star running back at North Carolina. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to do it. We\u2019d lose something precious.\u201d\n\n\u201cScholarship athletes are already paid,\u201d declared the Knight Commission members, \u201cin the most meaningful way poss-ible: with a free education.\u201d This evasion by prominent educators severed my last reluctant, emotional tie with imposed amateurism. I found it worse than self-serving. It echoes masters who once claimed that heavenly salvation would outweigh earthly injustice to slaves. In the era when our college sports first arose, colonial powers were turning the whole world upside down to define their own interests as all-inclusive and benevolent. Just so, the NCAA calls it heinous exploitation to pay college athletes a fair portion of what they earn.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/838710", "artist_names":

Religious Experience LyricsAlmost anyone who loves tennis and follows the men\u2019s tour on television has, over the last few years, had what might be termed Federer Moments. These are times, as you watch the young Swiss play, when the jaw drops and eyes protrude and sounds are made that bring spouses in from other rooms to see if you\u2019re O.K.\n\nThe Moments are more intense if you\u2019ve played enough tennis to understand the impossibility of what you just saw him do. We\u2019ve all got our examples. Here is one. It\u2019s the finals of the 2005 U.S. Open, Federer serving to Andre Agassi early in the fourth set. There\u2019s a medium-long exchange of groundstrokes, one with the distinctive butterfly shape of today\u2019s power-baseline game, Federer and Agassi yanking each other from side to side, each trying to set up the baseline winner...until suddenly Agassi hits a hard heavy cross-court backhand that pulls Federer way out wide to his ad (=left) side, and Federer gets to it but slices the stretch backhand short, a couple feet past the service line, which of course is the sort of thing Agassi dines out on, and as Federer\u2019s scrambling to reverse and get back to center, Agassi\u2019s moving in to take the short ball on the rise, and he smacks it hard right back into the same ad corner, trying to wrong-foot Federer, which in fact he does \u2014 Federer\u2019s still near the corner but running toward the centerline, and the ball\u2019s heading to a point behind him now, where he just was, and there\u2019s no time to turn his body around, and Agassi\u2019s following the shot in to the net at an angle from the backhand side...and what Federer now does is somehow instantly reverse thrust and sort of skip backward three or four steps, impossibly fast, to hit a forehand out of his backhand corner, all his weight moving backward, and the forehand is a topspin screamer down the line past Agassi at net, who lunges for it but the ball\u2019s past him, and it flies straight down the sideline and lands exactly in the deuce corner of Agassi\u2019s side, a winner \u2014 Federer\u2019s still dancing backward as it lands. And there\u2019s that familiar little second of shocked silence from the New York crowd before it erupts, and John McEnroe with his color man\u2019s headset on TV says (mostly to himself, it sounds like), \u201cHow do you hit a winner from that position?\u201d And he\u2019s right: given Agassi\u2019s position and world-class quickness, Federer had to send that ball down a two-inch pipe of space in order to pass him, which he did, moving backwards, with no setup time and none of his weight behind the shot. It was impossible. It was like something out of \u201cThe Matrix.\u201d I don\u2019t know what-all sounds were involved, but my spouse says she hurried in and there was popcorn all over the couch and I was down on one knee and my eyeballs looked like novelty-shop eyeballs.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s one example of a Federer Moment, and that was merely on TV \u2014 and the truth is that TV tennis is to live tennis pretty much as video porn is to the felt reality of human love.\n\nJournalistically speaking, there is no hot news to offer you about Roger Federer. He is, at 25, the best tennis player currently alive. Maybe the best ever. Bios and profiles abound. \u201c60 Minutes\u201d did a feature on him just last year. Anything you want to know about Mr. Roger N.M.I. Federer \u2014 his background, his home town of Basel, Switzerland, his parents\u2019 sane and unexploitative support of his talent, his junior tennis career, his early problems with fragility and temper, his beloved junior coach, how that coach\u2019s accidental death in 2002 both shattered and annealed Federer and helped make him what he now is, Federer\u2019s 39 career singles titles, his eight Grand Slams, his unusually steady and mature commitment to the girlfriend who travels with him (which on the men\u2019s tour is rare) and handles his affairs (which on the men\u2019s tour is unheard of), his old-school stoicism and mental toughness and good sportsmanship and evident overall decency and thoughtfulness and charitable largess \u2014 it\u2019s all just a Google search away. Knock yourself out.\n\nThis present article is more about a spectator\u2019s experience of Federer, and its context. The specific thesis here is that if you\u2019ve never seen the young man play live, and then do, in person, on the sacred grass of Wimbledon, through the literally withering heat and then wind and rain of the \u201906 fortnight, then you are apt to have what one of the tournament\u2019s press bus drivers describes as a \u201cbloody near-religious experience.\u201d It may be tempting, at first, to hear a phrase like this as just one more of the overheated tropes that people resort to to describe the feeling of Federer Moments. But the driver\u2019s phrase turns out to be true \u2014 literally, for an instant ecstatically \u2014 though it takes some time and serious watching to see this truth emerge.\n\nBeauty is not the goal of competitive sports, but high-level sports are a prime venue for the expression of human beauty. The relation is roughly that of courage to war.\nThe human beauty we\u2019re talking about here is beauty of a particular type; it might be called kinetic beauty. Its power and appeal are universal. It has nothing to do with sex or cultural norms. What it seems to have to do with, really, is human beings\u2019 reconciliation with the fact of having a body.(1)\n\nOf course, in men\u2019s sports no one ever talks about beauty or grace or the body. Men may profess their \u201clove\u201d of sports, but that love must always be cast and enacted in the symbology of war: elimination vs. advance, hierarchy of rank and standing, obsessive statistics, technical analysis, tribal and/or nationalist fervor, uniforms, mass noise, banners, chest-thumping, face-painting, etc. For reasons that are not well understood, war\u2019s codes are safer for most of us than love\u2019s. You too may find them so, in which case Spain\u2019s mesomorphic and totally martial Rafael Nadal is the man\u2019s man for you \u2014 he of the unsleeved biceps and Kabuki self-exhortations. Plus Nadal is also Federer\u2019s nemesis and the big surprise of this year\u2019s Wimbledon, since he\u2019s a clay-court specialist and no one expected him to make it past the first few rounds here. Whereas Federer, through the semifinals, has provided no surprise or competitive drama at all. He\u2019s outplayed each opponent so completely that the TV and print press are worried his matches are dull and can\u2019t compete effectively with the nationalist fervor of the World Cup.(2)\n\nJuly 9\u2019s men\u2019s final, though, is everyone\u2019s dream. Nadal vs. Federer is a replay of last month\u2019s French Open final, which Nadal won. Federer has so far lost only four matches all year, but they\u2019ve all been to Nadal. Still, most of these matches have been on slow clay, Nadal\u2019s best surface. Grass is Federer\u2019s best. On the other hand, the first week\u2019s heat has baked out some of the Wimbledon courts\u2019 slickness and made them slower. There\u2019s also the fact that Nadal has adjusted his clay-based game to grass \u2014 moving in closer to the baseline on his groundstrokes, amping up his serve, overcoming his allergy to the net. He just about disemboweled Agassi in the third round. The networks are in ecstasies. Before the match, on Centre Court, behind the glass slits above the south backstop, as the linesmen are coming out on court in their new Ralph Lauren uniforms that look so much like children\u2019s navalwear, the broadcast commentators can be seen practically bouncing up and down in their chairs. This Wimbledon final\u2019s got the revenge narrative, the king-versus-regicide dynamic, the stark character contrasts. It\u2019s the passionate machismo of southern Europe versus the intricate clinical artistry of the north. Apollo and Dionysus. Scalpel and cleaver. Righty and southpaw. Nos. 1 and 2 in the world. Nadal, the man who\u2019s taken the modern power-baseline game just as far as it goes, versus a man who\u2019s transfigured that modern game, whose precision and variety are as big a deal as his pace and foot-speed, but who may be peculiarly vulnerable to, or psyched out by, that first man. A British sportswriter, exulting with his mates in the press section, says, twice, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a war.\u201d\n\nPlus it\u2019s in the cathedral of Centre Court. And the men\u2019s final is always on the fortnight\u2019s second Sunday, the symbolism of which Wimbledon emphasizes by always omitting play on the first Sunday. And the spattery gale that has knocked over parking signs and everted umbrellas all morning suddenly quits an hour before match time, the sun emerging just as Centre Court\u2019s tarp is rolled back and the net posts driven home.\n\nFederer and Nadal come out to applause, make their ritual bows to the nobles\u2019 box. The Swiss is in the buttermilk-colored sport coat that Nike\u2019s gotten him to wear for Wimbledon this year. On Federer, and perhaps on him alone, it doesn\u2019t look absurd with shorts and sneakers. The Spaniard eschews all warm-up clothing, so you have to look at his muscles right away. He and the Swiss are both in all-Nike, up to the very same kind of tied white Nike hankie with the swoosh positioned above the third eye. Nadal tucks his hair under his hankie, but Federer doesn\u2019t, and smoothing and fussing with the bits of hair that fall over the hankie is the main Federer tic TV viewers get to see; likewise Nadal\u2019s obsessive retreat to the ballboy\u2019s towel between points. There happen to be other tics and habits, though, tiny perks of live viewing. There\u2019s the great care Roger Federer takes to hang the sport coat over his spare courtside chair\u2019s back, just so, to keep it from wrinkling \u2014 he\u2019s done this before each match here, and something about it seems childlike and weirdly sweet. Or the way he inevitably changes out his racket sometime in the second set, the new one always in the same clear plastic bag closed with blue tape, which he takes off carefully and always hands to a ballboy to dispose of. There\u2019s Nadal\u2019s habit of constantly picking his long shorts out of his bottom as he bounces the ball before serving, his way of always cutting his eyes warily from side to side as he walks the baseline, like a convict expecting to be shanked. And something odd on the Swiss\u2019s serve, if you look very closely. Holding ball and racket out in front, just before starting the motion, Federer always places the ball precisely in the V-shaped gap of the racket\u2019s throat, just below the head, just for an instant. If the fit isn\u2019t perfect, he adjusts the ball until it is. It happens very fast, but also every time, on both first serves and second.\n\nA between-the-legs return against Nicolas Kiefer at last year's U.S. Open.\nNadal and Federer now warm each other up for precisely five minutes; the umpire keeps time. There\u2019s a very definite order and etiquette to these pro warm-ups, which is something that television has decided you\u2019re not interested in seeing. Centre Court holds 13,000 and change. Another several thousand have done what people here do willingly every year, which is to pay a stiff general admission at the gate and then gather, with hampers and mosquito spray, to watch the match on an enormous TV screen outside Court 1. Your guess here is probably as good as anyone\u2019s.\n\nRight before play, up at the net, there\u2019s a ceremonial coin-toss to see who\u2019ll serve first. It\u2019s another Wimbledon ritual. The honorary coin-tosser this year is William Caines, assisted by the umpire and tournament referee. William Caines is a 7-year-old from Kent who contracted liver cancer at age 2 and somehow survived after surgery and horrific chemo. He\u2019s here representing Cancer Research UK. He\u2019s blond and pink-cheeked and comes up to about Federer\u2019s waist. The crowd roars its approval of the re-enacted toss. Federer smiles distantly the whole time. Nadal, just across the net, keeps dancing in place like a boxer, swinging his arms from side to side. I\u2019m not sure whether the U.S. networks show the coin-toss or not, whether this ceremony\u2019s part of their contractual obligation or whether they get to cut to commercial. As William\u2019s ushered off, there\u2019s more cheering, but it\u2019s scattered and disorganized; most of the crowd can\u2019t quite tell what to do. It\u2019s like once the ritual\u2019s over, the reality of why this child was part of it sinks in. There\u2019s a feeling of something important, something both uncomfortable and not, about a child with cancer tossing this dream-final\u2019s coin. The feeling, what-all it might mean, has a tip-of-the-tongue-type quality that remains elusive for at least the first two sets.(3)\n\nA top athlete\u2019s beauty is next to impossible to describe directly. Or to evoke. Federer\u2019s forehand is a great liquid whip, his backhand a one-hander that he can drive flat, load with topspin, or slice \u2014 the slice with such snap that the ball turns shapes in the air and skids on the grass to maybe ankle height. His serve has world-class pace and a degree of placement and variety no one else comes close to; the service motion is lithe and uneccentric, distinctive (on TV) only in a certain eel-like all-body snap at the moment of impact. His anticipation and court sense are otherworldly, and his footwork is the best in the game \u2014 as a child, he was also a soccer prodigy. All this is true, and yet none of it really explains anything or evokes the experience of watching this man play. Of witnessing, firsthand, the beauty and genius of his game. You more have to come at the aesthetic stuff obliquely, to talk around it, or \u2014 as Aquinas did with his own ineffable subject \u2014 to try to define it in terms of what it is not.\n\nOne thing it is not is televisable. At least not entirely. TV tennis has its advantages, but these advantages have disadvantages, and chief among them is a certain illusion of intimacy. Television\u2019s slow-mo replays, its close-ups and graphics, all so privilege viewers that we\u2019re not even aware of how much is lost in broadcast. And a large part of what\u2019s lost is the sheer physicality of top tennis, a sense of the speeds at which the ball is moving and the players are reacting. This loss is simple to explain. TV\u2019s priority, during a point, is coverage of the whole court, a comprehensive view, so that viewers can see both players and the overall geometry of the exchange. Television therefore chooses a specular vantage that is overhead and behind one baseline. You, the viewer, are above and looking down from behind the court. This perspective, as any art student will tell you, \u201cforeshortens\u201d the court. Real tennis, after all, is three-dimensional, but a TV screen\u2019s image is only 2-D. The dimension that\u2019s lost (or rather distorted) on the screen is the real court\u2019s length, the 78 feet between baselines; and the speed with which the ball traverses this length is a shot\u2019s pace, which on TV is obscured, and in person is fearsome to behold. That may sound abstract or overblown, in which case by all means go in person to some professional tournament \u2014 especially to the outer courts in early rounds, where you can sit 20 feet from the sideline \u2014 and sample the difference for yourself. If you\u2019ve watched tennis only on television, you simply have no idea how hard these pros are hitting the ball, how fast the ball is moving,(4) how little time the players have to get to it, and how quickly they\u2019re able to move and rotate and strike and recover. And none are faster, or more deceptively effortless about it, than Roger Federer.\n\nInterestingly, what is less obscured in TV coverage is Federer\u2019s intelligence, since this intelligence often manifests as angle. Federer is able to see, or create, gaps and angles for winners that no one else can envision, and television\u2019s perspective is perfect for viewing and reviewing these Federer Moments. What\u2019s harder to appreciate on TV is that these spectacular-looking angles and winners are not coming from nowhere \u2014 they\u2019re often set up several shots ahead, and depend as much on Federer\u2019s manipulation of opponents\u2019 positions as they do on the pace or placement of the coup de gr\u00e2ce. And understanding how and why Federer is able to move other world-class athletes around this way requires, in turn, a better technical understanding of the modern power-baseline game than TV \u2014 again \u2014 is set up to provide.\n\nWimbledon is strange. Verily it is the game\u2019s Mecca, the cathedral of tennis; but it would be easier to sustain the appropriate level of on-site veneration if the tournament weren\u2019t so intent on reminding you over and over that it\u2019s the cathedral of tennis. There\u2019s a peculiar mix of stodgy self-satisfaction and relentless self-promotion and -branding. It\u2019s a bit like the sort of authority figure whose office wall has every last plaque, diploma, and award he\u2019s ever gotten, and every time you come into the office you\u2019re forced to look at the wall and say something to indicate that you\u2019re impressed. Wimbledon\u2019s own walls, along nearly every significant corridor and passage, are lined with posters and signs featuring shots of past champions, lists of Wimbledon facts and trivia, historic lore, and so on. Some of this stuff is interesting; some is just odd. The Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Museum, for instance, has a collection of all the various kinds of rackets used here through the decades, and one of the many signs along the Level 2 passage of the Millennium Building(5) promotes this exhibition with both photos and didactic text, a kind of History of the Racket. Here, sic, is the climactic end of this text:\n\nToday\u2019s lightweight frames made of space-age materials like graphite, boron, titanium and ceramics, with larger heads \u2014 mid-size (90-95 square inches) and over-size (110 square inches) \u2014 have totally transformed the character of the game. Nowadays it is the powerful hitters who dominate with heavy topspin. Serve-and-volley players and those who rely on subtlety and touch have virtually disappeared.\n\nIt seems odd, to say the least, that such a diagnosis continues to hang here so prominently in the fourth year of Federer\u2019s reign over Wimbledon, since the Swiss has brought to men\u2019s tennis degrees of touch and subtlety unseen since (at least) the days of McEnroe\u2019s prime. But the sign\u2019s really just a testament to the power of dogma. For almost two decades, the party line\u2019s been that certain advances in racket technology, conditioning, and weight training have transformed pro tennis from a game of quickness and finesse into one of athleticism and brute power. And as an etiology of today\u2019s power-baseline game, this party line is broadly accurate. Today\u2019s pros truly are measurably bigger, stronger, and better conditioned,(6) and high-tech composite rackets really have increased their capacities for pace and spin. How, then, someone of Federer\u2019s consummate finesse has come to dominate the men\u2019s tour is a source of wide and dogmatic confusion.\nThere are three kinds of valid explanation for Federer\u2019s ascendancy. One kind involves mystery and metaphysics and is, I think, closest to the real truth. The others are more technical and make for better journalism.\n\nThe metaphysical explanation is that Roger Federer is one of those rare, preternatural athletes who appear to be exempt, at least in part, from certain physical laws. Good analogues here include Michael Jordan,(7) who could not only jump inhumanly high but actually hang there a beat or two longer than gravity allows, and Muhammad Ali, who really could \u201cfloat\u201d across the canvas and land two or three jabs in the clock-time required for one. There are probably a half-dozen other examples since 1960. And Federer is of this type \u2014 a type that one could call genius, or mutant, or avatar. He is never hurried or off-balance. The approaching ball hangs, for him, a split-second longer than it ought to. His movements are lithe rather than athletic. Like Ali, Jordan, Maradona, and Gretzky, he seems both less and more substantial than the men he faces. Particularly in the all-white that Wimbledon enjoys getting away with still requiring, he looks like what he may well (I think) be: a creature whose body is both flesh and, somehow, light.\n\nThis thing about the ball cooperatively hanging there, slowing down, as if susceptible to the Swiss\u2019s will \u2014 there\u2019s real metaphysical truth here. And in the following anecdote. After a July 7 semifinal in which Federer destroyed Jonas Bjorkman \u2014 not just beat him, destroyed him \u2014 and just before a requisite post-match news conference in which Bjorkman, who\u2019s friendly with Federer, says he was pleased to \u201chave the best seat in the house\u201d to watch the Swiss \u201cplay the nearest to perfection you can play tennis,\u201d Federer and Bjorkman are chatting and joking around, and Bjorkman asks him just how unnaturally big the ball was looking to him out there, and Federer confirms that it was \u201clike a bowling ball or basketball.\u201d He means it just as a bantery, modest way to make Bjorkman feel better, to confirm that he\u2019s surprised by how unusually well he played today; but he\u2019s also revealing something about what tennis is like for him. Imagine that you\u2019re a person with preternaturally good reflexes and coordination and speed, and that you\u2019re playing high-level tennis. Your experience, in play, will not be that you possess phenomenal reflexes and speed; rather, it will seem to you that the tennis ball is quite large and slow-moving, and that you always have plenty of time to hit it. That is, you won\u2019t experience anything like the (empirically real) quickness and skill that the live audience, watching tennis balls move so fast they hiss and blur, will attribute to you.(8)\n\nVelocity\u2019s just one part of it. Now we\u2019re getting technical. Tennis is often called a \u201cgame of inches,\u201d but the clich\u00e9 is mostly referring to where a shot lands. In terms of a player\u2019s hitting an incoming ball, tennis is actually more a game of micrometers: vanishingly tiny changes around the moment of impact will have large effects on how and where the ball travels. The same principle explains why even the smallest imprecision in aiming a rifle will still cause a miss if the target\u2019s far enough away.\n\nBy way of illustration, let\u2019s slow things way down. Imagine that you, a tennis player, are standing just behind your deuce corner\u2019s baseline. A ball is served to your forehand \u2014 you pivot (or rotate) so that your side is to the ball\u2019s incoming path and start to take your racket back for the forehand return. Keep visualizing up to where you\u2019re about halfway into the stroke\u2019s forward motion; the incoming ball is now just off your front hip, maybe six inches from point of impact. Consider some of the variables involved here. On the vertical plane, angling your racket face just a couple degrees forward or back will create topspin or slice, respectively; keeping it perpendicular will produce a flat, spinless drive. Horizontally, adjusting the racket face ever so slightly to the left or right, and hitting the ball maybe a millisecond early or late, will result in a cross-court versus down-the-line return. Further slight changes in the curves of your groundstroke\u2019s motion and follow-through will help determine how high your return passes over the net, which, together with the speed at which you\u2019re swinging (along with certain characteristics of the spin you impart), will affect how deep or shallow in the opponent\u2019s court your return lands, how high it bounces, etc. These are just the broadest distinctions, of course \u2014 like, there\u2019s heavy topspin vs. light topspin, or sharply cross-court vs. only slightly cross-court, etc. There are also the issues of how close you\u2019re allowing the ball to get to your body, what grip you\u2019re using, the extent to which your knees are bent and/or weight\u2019s moving forward, and whether you\u2019re able simultaneously to watch the ball and to see what your opponent\u2019s doing after he serves. These all matter, too. Plus there\u2019s the fact that you\u2019re not putting a static object into motion here but rather reversing the flight and (to a varying extent) spin of a projectile coming toward you \u2014 coming, in the case of pro tennis, at speeds that make conscious thought impossible. Mario Ancic\u2019s first serve, for instance, often comes in around 130 m.p.h. Since it\u2019s 78 feet from Ancic\u2019s baseline to yours, that means it takes 0.41 seconds for his serve to reach you.(9) This is less than the time it takes to blink quickly, twice.\n\nThe upshot is that pro tennis involves intervals of time too brief for deliberate action. Temporally, we\u2019re more in the operative range of reflexes, purely physical reactions that bypass conscious thought. And yet an effective return of serve depends on a large set of decisions and physical adjustments that are a whole lot more involved and intentional than blinking, jumping when startled, etc.\n\nSuccessfully returning a hard-served tennis ball requires what\u2019s sometimes called \u201cthe kinesthetic sense,\u201d meaning the ability to control the body and its artificial extensions through complex and very quick systems of tasks. English has a whole cloud of terms for various parts of this ability: feel, touch, form, proprioception, coordination, hand-eye coordination, kinesthesia, grace, control, reflexes, and so on. For promising junior players, refining the kinesthetic sense is the main goal of the extreme daily practice regimens we often hear about.(10) The training here is both muscular and neurological. Hitting thousands of strokes, day after day, develops the ability to do by \u201cfeel\u201d what cannot be done by regular conscious thought. Repetitive practice like this often looks tedious or even cruel to an outsider, but the outsider can\u2019t feel what\u2019s going on inside the player \u2014 tiny adjustments, over and over, and a sense of each change\u2019s effects that gets more and more acute even as it recedes from normal consciousness.(11)\n\nThe time and discipline required for serious kinesthetic training are one reason why top pros are usually people who\u2019ve devoted most of their waking lives to tennis, starting (at the very latest) in their early teens. It was, for example, at age 13 that Roger Federer finally gave up soccer, and a recognizable childhood, and entered Switzerland\u2019s national tennis training center in Ecublens. At 16, he dropped out of classroom studies and started serious international competition.\n\nIt was only weeks after quitting school that Federer won Junior Wimbledon. Obviously, this is something that not every junior who devotes himself to tennis can do. Just as obviously, then, there is more than time and training involved \u2014 there is also sheer talent, and degrees of it. Extraordinary kinesthetic ability must be present (and measurable) in a kid just to make the years of practice and training worthwhile...but from there, over time, the cream starts to rise and separate. So one type of technical explanation for Federer\u2019s dominion is that he\u2019s just a bit more kinesthetically talented than the other male pros. Only a little bit, since everyone in the Top 100 is himself kinesthetically gifted \u2014 but then, tennis is a game of inches.\n\nThis answer is plausible but incomplete. It would probably not have been incomplete in 1980. In 2006, though, it\u2019s fair to ask why this kind of talent still matters so much. Recall what is true about dogma and Wimbledon\u2019s sign. Kinesthetic virtuoso or no, Roger Federer is now dominating the largest, strongest, fittest, best-trained and -coached field of male pros who\u2019ve ever existed, with everyone using a kind of nuclear racket that\u2019s said to have made the finer calibrations of kinesthetic sense irrelevant, like trying to whistle Mozart during a Metallica concert.\n\nAccording to reliable sources, honorary coin-tosser William Caines\u2019s backstory is that one day, when he was 2\u00bd, his mother found a lump in his tummy, and took him to the doctor, and the lump was diagnosed as a malignant liver tumor. At which point one cannot, of course, imagine...a tiny child undergoing chemo, serious chemo, his mother having to watch, carry him home, nurse him, then bring him back to that place for more chemo. How did she answer her child\u2019s question \u2014 the big one, the obvious one? And who could answer hers? What could any priest or pastor say that wouldn\u2019t be grotesque?\n\nIt\u0092s 2-1 Nadal in the final\u2019s second set, and he\u2019s serving. Federer won the first set at love but then flagged a bit, as he sometimes does, and is quickly down a break. Now, on Nadal\u2019s ad, there\u2019s a 16-stroke point. Nadal is serving a lot faster than he did in Paris, and this one\u2019s down the center. Federer floats a soft forehand high over the net, which he can get away with because Nadal never comes in behind his serve. The Spaniard now hits a characteristically heavy topspin forehand deep to Federer\u2019s backhand; Federer comes back with an even heavier topspin backhand, almost a clay-court shot. It\u2019s unexpected and backs Nadal up, slightly, and his response is a low hard short ball that lands just past the service line\u2019s T on Federer\u2019s forehand side. Against most other opponents, Federer could simply end the point on a ball like this, but one reason Nadal gives him trouble is that he\u2019s faster than the others, can get to stuff they can\u2019t; and so Federer here just hits a flat, medium-hard cross-court forehand, going not for a winner but for a low, shallowly angled ball that forces Nadal up and out to the deuce side, his backhand. Nadal, on the run, backhands it hard down the line to Federer\u2019s backhand; Federer slices it right back down the same line, slow and floaty with backspin, making Nadal come back to the same spot. Nadal slices the ball right back \u2014 three shots now all down the same line \u2014 and Federer slices the ball back to the same spot yet again, this one even slower and floatier, and Nadal gets planted and hits a big two-hander back down the same line \u2014 it\u2019s like Nadal\u2019s camped out now on his deuce side; he\u2019s no longer moving all the way back to the baseline\u2019s center between shots; Federer\u2019s hypnotized him a little. Federer now hits a very hard, deep topspin backhand, the kind that hisses, to a point just slightly on the ad side of Nadal\u2019s baseline, which Nadal gets to and forehands cross-court; and Federer responds with an even harder, heavier cross-court backhand, baseline-deep and moving so fast that Nadal has to hit the forehand off his back foot and then scramble to get back to center as the shot lands maybe two feet short on Federer\u2019s backhand side again. Federer steps to this ball and now hits a totally different cross-court backhand, this one much shorter and sharper-angled, an angle no one would anticipate, and so heavy and blurred with topspin that it lands shallow and just inside the sideline and takes off hard after the bounce, and Nadal can\u2019t move in to cut it off and can\u2019t get to it laterally along the baseline, because of all the angle and topspin \u2014 end of point. It\u2019s a spectacular winner, a Federer Moment; but watching it live, you can see that it\u2019s also a winner that Federer started setting up four or even five shots earlier. Everything after that first down-the-line slice was designed by the Swiss to maneuver Nadal and lull him and then disrupt his rhythm and balance and open up that last, unimaginable angle \u2014 an angle that would have been impossible without extreme topspin.\n\nExtreme topspin is the hallmark of today\u2019s power-baseline game. This is something that Wimbledon\u2019s sign gets right.(12) Why topspin is so key, though, is not commonly understood. What\u2019s commonly understood is that high-tech composite rackets impart much more pace to the ball, rather like aluminum baseball bats as opposed to good old lumber. But that dogma is false. The truth is that, at the same tensile strength, carbon-based composites are lighter than wood, and this allows modern rackets to be a couple ounces lighter and at least an inch wider across the face than the vintage Kramer and Maxply. It\u2019s the width of the face that\u2019s vital. A wider face means there\u2019s more total string area, which means the sweet spot\u2019s bigger. With a composite racket, you don\u2019t have to meet the ball in the precise geometric center of the strings in order to generate good pace. Nor must you be spot-on to generate topspin, a spin that (recall) requires a tilted face and upwardly curved stroke, brushing over the ball rather than hitting flat through it \u2014 this was quite hard to do with wood rackets, because of their smaller face and niggardly sweet spot. Composites\u2019 lighter, wider heads and more generous centers let players swing faster and put way more topspin on the ball...and, in turn, the more topspin you put on the ball, the harder you can hit it, because there\u2019s more margin for error. Topspin causes the ball to pass high over the net, describe a sharp arc, and come down fast into the opponent\u2019s court (instead of maybe soaring out).\nSo the basic formula here is that composite rackets enable topspin, which in turn enables groundstrokes vastly faster and harder than 20 years ago \u2014 it\u2019s common now to see male pros pulled up off the ground and halfway around in the air by the force of their strokes, which in the old days was something one saw only in Jimmy Connors.\n\nConnors was not, by the way, the father of the power-baseline game. He whaled mightily from the baseline, true, but his groundstrokes were flat and spinless and had to pass very low over the net. Nor was Bjorn Borg a true power-baseliner. Both Borg and Connors played specialized versions of the classic baseline game, which had evolved as a counterforce to the even more classic serve-and-volley game, which was itself the dominant form of men\u2019s power tennis for decades, and of which John McEnroe was the greatest modern exponent. You probably know all this, and may also know that McEnroe toppled Borg and then more or less ruled the men\u2019s game until the appearance, around the mid-1980\u2019s, of (a) modern composite rackets(13) and (b) Ivan Lendl, who played with an early form of composite and was the true progenitor of power-baseline tennis.(14)\n\nIvan Lendl was the first top pro whose strokes and tactics appeared to be designed around the special capacities of the composite racket. His goal was to win points from the baseline, via either passing shots or outright winners. His weapon was his groundstrokes, especially his forehand, which he could hit with overwhelming pace because of the amount of topspin he put on the ball. The blend of pace and topspin also allowed Lendl to do something that proved crucial to the advent of the power-baseline game. He could pull off radical, extraordinary angles on hard-hit groundstrokes, mainly because of the speed with which heavy topspin makes the ball dip and land without going wide. In retrospect, this changed the whole physics of aggressive tennis. For decades, it had been angle that made the serve-and-volley game so lethal. The closer one is to the net, the more of the opponent\u2019s court is open \u2014 the classic advantage of volleying was that you could hit angles that would go way wide if attempted from the baseline or midcourt. But topspin on a groundstroke, if it\u2019s really extreme, can bring the ball down fast and shallow enough to exploit many of these same angles. Especially if the groundstroke you\u2019re hitting is off a somewhat short ball \u2014 the shorter the ball, the more angles are possible. Pace, topspin, and aggressive baseline angles: and lo, it\u2019s the power-baseline game.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that Ivan Lendl was an immortally great tennis player. He was simply the first top pro to demonstrate what heavy topspin and raw power could achieve from the baseline. And, most important, the achievement was replicable, just like the composite racket. Past a certain threshold of physical talent and training, the main requirements were athleticism, aggression, and superior strength and conditioning. The result (omitting various complications and subspecialties(15)) has been men\u2019s pro tennis for the last 20 years: ever bigger, stronger, fitter players generating unprecedented pace and topspin off the ground, trying to force the short or weak ball that they can put away.\n\nIllustrative stat: When Lleyton Hewitt defeated David Nalbandian in the 2002 Wimbledon men\u2019s final, there was not one single serve-and-volley point.(16)\n\nThe generic power-baseline game is not boring \u2014 certainly not compared with the two-second points of old-time serve-and-volley or the moon-ball tedium of classic baseline attrition. But it is somewhat static and limited; it is not, as pundits have publicly feared for years, the evolutionary endpoint of tennis. The player who\u2019s shown this to be true is Roger Federer. And he\u2019s shown it from within the modern game.\n\nThis within is what\u2019s important here; this is what a purely neural account leaves out. And it is why sexy attributions like touch and subtlety must not be misunderstood. With Federer, it\u2019s not either/or. The Swiss has every bit of Lendl and Agassi\u2019s pace on his groundstrokes, and leaves the ground when he swings, and can out-hit even Nadal from the backcourt.(17) What\u2019s strange and wrong about Wimbledon\u2019s sign, really, is its overall dolorous tone. Subtlety, touch, and finesse are not dead in the power-baseline era. For it is, still, in 2006, very much the power-baseline era: Roger Federer is a first-rate, kick-ass power-baseliner. It\u2019s just that that\u2019s not all he is. There\u2019s also his intelligence, his occult anticipation, his court sense, his ability to read and manipulate opponents, to mix spins and speeds, to misdirect and disguise, to use tactical foresight and peripheral vision and kinesthetic range instead of just rote pace \u2014 all this has exposed the limits, and possibilities, of men\u2019s tennis as it\u2019s now played.\n\nWhich sounds very high-flown and nice, of course, but please understand that with this guy it\u2019s not high-flown or abstract. Or nice. In the same emphatic, empirical, dominating way that Lendl drove home his own lesson, Roger Federer is showing that the speed and strength of today\u2019s pro game are merely its skeleton, not its flesh. He has, figuratively and literally, re-embodied men\u2019s tennis, and for the first time in years the game\u2019s future is unpredictable. You should have seen, on the grounds\u2019 outside courts, the variegated ballet that was this year\u2019s Junior Wimbledon. Drop volleys and mixed spins, off-speed serves, gambits planned three shots ahead \u2014 all as well as the standard-issue grunts and booming balls. Whether anything like a nascent Federer was here among these juniors can\u2019t be known, of course. Genius is not replicable. Inspiration, though, is contagious, and multiform \u2014 and even just to see, close up, power and aggression made vulnerable to beauty is to feel inspired and (in a fleeting, mortal way) reconciled.4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1555997", "artist_names": "Robin Luke", "full_title": "Susie Darlin' by\u00a0Robin\u00a0Luke",

written in the stars\nWe can go wherever, so let's do it now or never\nBaby, nothing's ever, ever too far\nGlitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes\nShining just the way we are\nI feel like we're forever every time we get together\nBut whatever, let's get lost on Mars\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou want me, I want you, baby\nMy sugarboo, I'm levitating\nThe Milky Way, we're renegading\nYeah, yeah, yeah,
