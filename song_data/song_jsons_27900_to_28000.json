niggas out the bayou\nPockets flooded, y'all be dilute\nWatered down, I'm Big Mac\nI'm quarter pound, you chicken nugget\nFuck it, travel bag Balenciaga, 30,000 just for luggage\nFinancial advisor buggin', Flower Boy is buzzin'\nGrammy-nominated, tell yo' cousin ain't nobody fuckin' with him\n[Chorus]\nMan, now they go\nI cut off some friends, where they go?\nI stick to the plan, that's the

shit in drive, I'm live like ammunition\nNo permission needed, I proceeded to accelerate\nHad days with hella hate, but gotta let that anger migrate\nAll this shit that's on my plate\nThat food for thought that can't be bought\nBut only taught, and on the real, know\n[Chorus: Logic]\nI can't get much higher, been smoking that fire\nRiding 'round the city with my homies that know me\nKnow that I

reason\nEyes so low from the chiefin'\nI be getting high when I wake up\nAnd roll me one more 'fore I'm sleeping\nMan, I be smoking so good that I be forgetting the past\nIt don't even come to my house\nIf it ain't wrapped up in a turkey bag\nWe roll up the herb and laugh, kick back, blow a zip\nTake it on a plane, know I smoke the same when I'm on a trip\nNigga like me always got weed on 'em (got weed on 'em)\nTry to tell me that she don't smoke, later on she joinin'\nAin't no point, no I'm back, keep going in\nYou been rolling with cats, who boring\nI be bringing them stacks

in the bank\nThis that RattPack and that Taylor Gang\nThey know the face and they know the name\nI'm a married man with a bad wife\nNever fuck around unless it's Mary Jane\nCome play the game,

use\nWe ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through\n\n[Verse 1]\nBlack boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you\nBlack boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you\nPull up on the side of you\nWindow rolled down, 'profile'\nThen we wonder why we see this side of you\nProbably comin' from the dope house\nWe could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out\nWe know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum\nOn you another drug charge, homie, it's back inside for you\nAnd just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true\nPistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to unload it\nIn your back, then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you\nFucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?\nI keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'\nNo matter how many lives you ruin\nIt's for the red, white and blue\nTime to go find a new one and split his head right in two\nNo one's ever indicted you\nWhy? 'Cause you're a...\n[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]\nWhite boy, white boy, you're a rockstar\nMy momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live\nWhite boy, white boy, in your cop car\nBut I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve\nWhite boy, white boy, you're untouchable\nThe world's coming to an end, I don't even care\nNobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar\n\n[Verse 2]\nBlack boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and\nWe don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man\nDon't tell us your attitude's a result of that\nBalderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?\nWhy you kicking that soda can?\nPull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and\nThrow your ass in the van cuffed\nYou don't have to know our plans or what our intentions are\nOur cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands\nAnd put our minds more at ease\nOr get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy\nWe're fightin' a crime war, here come the swine\nTryna clean up the streets from all these minorities\nThat's what we call 'em pigsties for\nThey're like eyesores to police\nTalk to you like just a piece of trash\nFeels like we're stuck in a time warp to me\nAs I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions\nAs this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in\nTo the sixties, having black skin is risky\n'Cause this keeps happening\nThroughout history, African-Americans have been treated like shit\nAnd I admit, there have been times where it's been embarrassin' to be a...\nYou might also like[Chorus: Eminem & Cheech and Chong]\nWhite boy, white boy, you're a rockstar\nMy momma talkin' to me, tryna tell me how to live\nWhite boy, white boy, in your cop car\nBut I don't listen to her, 'cause my head is like a sieve\nWhite boy, white boy, you're untouchable\nThe world's coming to an end, I don't even care\nNobody can tell me shit 'cause I'm a big rockstar\n[Part II]\n\n[Verse 3]\nSeems like the average lifespan of a white man\nIs more than twice than a black life span\nI wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner\nI feel like checking out on life, can't escape this circumstance\nI'd rather hear 'em say \"Die N-word\" than Die Antwoord\nNinja, now it's better disguised banter\nBut that's life, strapped 'cause we're strapped financially\nAnd can't find answers\nWe're applying, but McDonald's\nSeems to be the only franchise that'll hire\nSo how can we have higher standards?\nAs Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter\nWe fight back with violence but acts like that are\nBlack eyes on the movement\nWhich makes black lives madder\nAt cops and cops madder\nThat's why it's at a stalemate\nAnd can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops\nI wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops\nThe block is our backyards, officers, not the crack spot\nCall the attack dogs off of us, man\nYou always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop\nAnd bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop\nSendin' white cops in the black neighborhoods\nWho ain't acclimated to 'em, like that's the way to do it\nWho seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns\nAnd know nobody black so they act afraid of us\nAnd that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em\nA subconscious racist\nWait, why are there black neighborhoods?\n'Cause America segregated us, designated us to an area\nSeparated us, Section-Eight'd us\nWhen we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us\nAnd education sucks, and every day's another\nFreddie Gray for us, a levy breaks or fuzz\nWhy is it they treat us like dryer lint?\nWe just want a safe environment for our kids\nBut can't escape the sirens\nDon't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in\nThe poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in\nThe lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence\nAnd we're trapped in these racial biases\nThat plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise\nEvery time we see a devil's face\nLions, tigers, and bears, oh my\nIt's more like billy clubs and gats\nAnd we really love it when you think we're guilty \u2018cause we're black\n\"But you kill each other, facts\nYou peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats\u201d\nSingle mother strugglin' through substance abuse\nWhile people with nothin' to lose shoot each other for shoes\nFuck your Republican views\nPull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?\nAnd streets act as a narrator, don't gotta read comics\nOr be that into characters, just to see that, just to be black\nYou better be strapped with a derringer\nOr be \u201ccapped in America\u201d like Steve Rogers\n'Cause no one oversees these cops and\nAll we see is 'em beat charges\nWe done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious, and got off\nSo we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings\nJust keep marchin', 'til we reach congress\nBut they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance\nIf you try to slander the flag but\nSomebody has to be the sacrificial lamb\nSo they call it a Kaepernick tantrum\nIf you don't stand for the national anthem\nWe raise it, you better praise it\nOr you'll be made to feel like a traitor, we'll\nTreat you like Rodney Dangerfield\nHome of the brave is still racist 'ville\nSo this whole nation feels like a plantation field\nIn a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals\nThat had its Natives killed\nGot you singin' this star-spangled spiel\nTo a piece of cloth that represents the \"Land of the Free\" that made people slaves to build270Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/3156682", "artist_names": "Romeo Santos (Ft.

house party that I didn't even wanna go to\nThe way you move\nHad me first time feelin' in a while I should make one too\nSometimes, the finish line is just the start of something new\nIf I'd have never lost her\nThen I'd have never found you\nNo, I'd have never found you (Never found you)\nNever found you\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, I still go out sometimes\nBut I don't ever try to get that drunk\nNow when I can't sleep, it's 'cause you're all over me in the sheets\nAll night keepin' me up\nYeah, it's hard to believe that a goodbye could be\nSo good to me\n\n[Chorus]\nNo, I'd have never found

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nStarted off poor with plans to own more\nNow we own stores and fuck the baddest whores\nI was on tour with niggas that sold raw\nStarted sellin' white, we won't sell it no more\nI'm like, Trump ain't feelin' us, cops still killin' us\nNiggas takin' shots, can't stop me, they ain't real enough\nCut her off, act like she's dead and it's killin' her\nNew Dawn, Hermes seat, I let the ceiling up\nJust to kill 'em softly, ooh, get 'em off me\nTry to crucify me like I'm Jesus the way she cross me\nI'm too bossy and too thorough\nTo move like a weirdo, on point like an arrow\nWe started off with zero, now I'm seein' M's\nDiamonds like water and they jumpin' out the gym\nShootin' like Harden if your head was the rim\n'Cause niggas wanna line me like a shape up and a trim, damn\nBack when I was broke, they was cool with it\nNow every move I make I'm in the news with it\nEven if I ain't do it they be like \"You did it!\"\nMy teacher always used to tell me \"You gon' lose nigga!\"\nThat's why I never went to school nigga\nAnd why I'm rappin' like I got somethin' to prove nigga\nWent and bought the mansion with the pool in it\nBilly with the stamp, I get two with it\nMove with it 'cause these niggas wanna take my life\nNo weapon formed against me every time I pray at night\nScoopin' thotties in the Phantom, that's the way of life\nAnd make 'em fuck their best friends like they was dykes\nReachin' for the Glock every time I play the light\nI'm on 12 o'clock every time I play them bikes\nI'm with the pack, uh, gettin' back, yeah\nSpendin' dope, nigga, sellin' smack, gang\nI'm gettin' chips off music like Rap Snacks\nYeah, 10 mil in cash of Ethika, that's a fact\nMoney, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet\nI know these niggas upset, they ain't see me fall yet\nWins and losses!\n[Chorus]\nThey wanna see me fold\nAnd I will never sell my soul\nI'm on some shit that they ain't seen before\nDream chasin', catchin' all my goals\nAnd I don't need these whores\nI'm gettin' money, me and all my woes\nPlay with me, you know it's all-out war\nThe young niggas goin' all out for us\n\n[Verse 2]\nBloggers in a frenzy, truck to the Bentley\nAin't doin' no interviews, I'm busy, nigga we litty\nSo when you see me out don't ask me about no Nicki\nFuck I look like tellin' my business on Wendy\nNiggas gossip like queens, we was servin' fiends\n.40 bust your windows out: Jazmine Sullivan\nThey told 'em pop Mollys, I told 'em to be kings\nSippin' 1942 like it's lean\nI done seen all these niggas try to downplay my dreams\nSo I'ma give it to 'em every time I'm on the scene\nPull up Ghost Ghost, Wraith Wraith when you see me\nSome suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me\nI know it, I go through it, don't show it\nI told niggas who wrote it, ain't takin' back what I quoted\nStarted off with a quarter, flipped that to a half\nTurned that to an ounce, got some shit in the stash\nNigga say that he gon' rob me, put a brick on his ass\nNow every killer in my city tryna look for his ass\nAnd one thing 'bout Meek Milly, I'ma get to a bag\nHad to starve all day just to get to it fast\nLike Ramadan, totin' K's like it's Palestine\nReal niggas in my ambiance, bottom line\nEver since I met Ross and signed the dotted line\nI gave my momma 10,000 at least a thousand times\nDo the math on it!\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThey wanna see me fold\nAnd I will never sell my soul\nI'm on some shit that they ain't seen before\nDream chasin', catchin' all my goals\nAnd I don't need these whores\nI'm gettin' money, me and all my woes\nPlay with me, you know it's all-out war\nThe young niggas goin' all out for us\n\n[Verse 3]\nTalkin', this my cocky flow\nDamn Daniel, why you son him? Mr Miyagi though\nThis that rose gold Patek, call me like '94\nMean nothin' to me, I tell you how it gotta go\nRain, sleet, on that corner when the block was slow\nEverybody was tryna trap, we started poppin' though\nHeard that bitch say she cut me, I was like \"\u00a1adi\u00f3s!\"\nIn the field, knock 'em down, it look like dominoes\nYoung nigga, I turned my Impala to a Wraith\nWhen you get a dollar they gon' hate\nBought my mom the crib with that gate\nPrivate school for all them babies, now they straight, nigga\n\n[Chorus]\nThey wanna see me fold\nAnd I will never sell my soul\nI'm on some shit that they ain't seen before\nDream chasin', catchin' all my goals\nAnd I don't need these whores\nI'm gettin' money, me and all my woes\nPlay with me, you know it's all-out war\nThe young niggas goin' all out for us30Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/3131268", "artist_names": "Romeo Santos", "full_title": "Imitadora by\u00a0Romeo\u00a0Santos", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/09d133fc668277a690bd28abc57c07aa.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/09d133fc668277a690bd28abc57c07aa.960x960x1.jpg", "id": 3131268, "instrumental": false, "language": "es", "lyrics_owner_id": 3848985, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1657910176, "path": "/Romeo-santos-imitadora-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 5, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Romeo-santos-imitadora-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2017, "month": 6, "day": 23}, "release_date_for_display": "June 23, 2017", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jun. 23, 2017", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/dc072c71b4ffa18baada13557edb574d.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/dc072c71b4ffa18baada13557edb574d.640x640x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 126029}, "title": "Imitadora", "title_with_featured": "Imitadora", "updated_by_human_at": 1657910184, "url": "https://genius.com/Romeo-santos-imitadora-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/14717", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ccdf6a62577079b6c2ff8dea6c2d6955.421x421x1.jpg", "id": 14717, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ccdf6a62577079b6c2ff8dea6c2d6955.421x421x1.jpg", "index_character": "r", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": true, "name": "Romeo Santos", "slug": "Romeo-santos", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Romeo-santos", "iq": 115}, "artist": "Romeo Santos", "lyrics": "Imitadora Lyrics[Letra de \"Imitadora\"]\n\n[Intro]\nHey\nWho are you?\n\n[Verso]\nMi memoria ha conservado lo que se ha llevado el viento\nY yo estoy estancado en esos tiempos\nCuando t\u00fa me amabas y con gran fulgor sent\u00eda tus besos\nDime, qu\u00edtame esta duda\n\u00bfQui\u00e9n es esta extra\u00f1a que se ha apoderado de tu ser?\n\u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 la amante loca que me erizaba la piel?\nPorque ya t\u00fa no me tocas como lo hac\u00eda esa mujer\nAlgo no anda bien\nEscucha las palabras de Romeo\n[Coro]\nEsta noche me hago el interrogante\nY le pongo fin a la impostora, usurpadora\nExijo contigo una entrevista\nSospecho plagio a mi se\u00f1ora, mala imitadora\nDime, tengo unas preguntas\n\u00bfD\u00f3nde fue bajo la lluvia que te di ese primer beso?\nDime tambi\u00e9n, rel\u00e1tame el momento\nN\u00famero de alojamiento donde yo te hice mujer\nConf\u00edrmame\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 me enciende en el sexo?\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 me encanta de tu cuerpo?\nNuestra primera aventura\nQuiero detalles\n\u00bfSer\u00e1 el cuello o el ombliguito tu punto favorito?\nPorque yo s\u00ed s\u00e9 cual es\nSi en verdad eres la original, demu\u00e9stramelo ahora\n\n[Coro]\nEsta noche me hago el interrogante\nY le pongo fin a la impostora, usurpadora\nExijo contigo una entrevista\nSospecho plagio a mi se\u00f1ora, mala imitadora\nDime, tengo unas preguntas\n\u00bfD\u00f3nde fue bajo la lluvia que te di ese primer beso?\nDime tambi\u00e9n, rel\u00e1tame el momento\nN\u00famero de alojamiento donde yo te hice mujer\nConf\u00edrmame\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 me enciende en el sexo?\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 me encanta de tu cuerpo?\nNuestra primer aventura\nQuiero detalles\n\u00bfSer\u00e1 el cuello o el ombliguito\nTu punto favorito?\nPorque yo s\u00ed s\u00e9 cual es\nMmm, si en verdad eres la original, demu\u00e9stramelo ahora\nYou might also like[Interludio: Romeo Santos]\nT\u00fa no era' as\u00ed cuando te conoc\u00ed\nThe king\n\n[Outro: Romeo Santos & Phillip Jackson]\nTell me where she's at?\n\u00bfQui\u00e9n es esta imitadora hoy en su lugar?\nTell me where she's at?\nYo la extra\u00f1o \u00bfa d\u00f3nde se me perdi\u00f3?\nTell me where she's at?\nQue regrese mi amada porque t\u00fa, no eres t\u00fa5Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 12, "api_path": "/songs/2927027", "artist_names": "Meek Mill (Ft.

game left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)\nThe streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)\nNiggas said they with you when they really not (really not)\nNiggas plot on everything you got (everything you got)\nThe streets left me with a heavy heart (heavy heart)\n\n[Verse 1]\nUh, I kept it triller from the very start\nSeen so many people crossed me, don't know where to start\nUh, that bitch left me with a heavy heart\nYeah, still on them papers, they won't let me off\nNever thought we'd make it out the ghetto, now look where we are\nFucking famous bitches and that pussy taste like caviar\nI done gave these niggas everything and that was from the heart\nRollie, chain, every car, all it did was left me scarred\nHeard my dog talk behind my back and I'm like let him talk\nI won't say his name but he gone feel this shit in every bar\nFeel this shit in all my verses\nWas it really worth it\nCut the grass and all the snakes gone surface\nNobody's perfect\nShowed them cash, he kinda made me nervous\nMaybe I'm trippin'\nHoping this paranoia from all this shit that we been in\nWatched you pour gasoline, and burned out all of your bridges\nNigga, you sunk the friendship, something you got to live with\nFuck it!\n[Chorus]\nI gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)\nAlways kept it real from the very start (very start)\nNiggas ain't thorough like I always

screaming let me out\nNo they ain't riding, it was drama, I'm like yeah we out\nTrying to please these niggas, shit gone prolly wear me out\nDrive me crazy, I been by myself lately\n40 on my belt lately, I ain't need no help lately\nNigga cross me, I cut him off and I felt crazy\n'Cause I got a purple heart\nShit I'd rather work and walk 'fore I ride luxury with niggas that don't fuck with me\nI'm startin' to hate this fame shit look what it done to me\nSeen half these niggas turn they back when rappers tried to come for me\nDon't want them in my company just want to be a company\nHunnit mill'\nDream chasers, chasing dreams\nHate is fake, and love is real\nNiggas said I wouldn't win told them yes the fuck I will\nHit the studio with all my feeling and I let 'em spill\nForever thorough, be a sucka nigga, no I never will (No!)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI gave this hustle everything I got (thing I got)\nAlways kept it real from the very start (very

a big head, I was like hol' Gina\nI made a mil, I got a deal, I lift the whole team up\nI had the whole squad lit, I had the city poppin'\nI told my dog don't listen to them, get caught up in that gossip\nThey wanna see you in the hood back when you ain't got shit\nRemember nights was on the 'gram, toasting with the pilot\nThen everything went sour, this little thing of ours\n\n[Chorus]\nI gave
