Infinite Love,\nWhose latence is the plenitude of All,\nThou with retracted beams, and self-eclipse\nVeiling, revealest thine eternal Sun.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspBut some there are who deem themselves most free\nWhen they within this gross and visible sphere\nChain down the wing\u00e9d thought, scoffing ascent,\nProud in their meanness: and themselves they cheat\nWith noisy emptiness of learned phrase,\nTheir subtle fluids, impacts, essences,\nSelf-working tools, uncaused effects, and all\nThose blind Omniscients, those Almighty Slaves,\nUntenanting creation of its God.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspBut Properties are God: the naked mass\n(If mass there be, fantastic guess or ghost)\nActs only by its inactivity.\nHere we pause humbly. Others boldlier think\nThat as one body seems the aggregate\nOf atoms numberless, each organized;\nSo by a strange and dim similitude\nInfinite myriads of self-conscious minds\nAre one all-conscious Spirit, which informs\nWith absolute ubiquity of thought\n(His one eternal self-affirming act!)\nAll his involv\u00e9d Monads, that yet seem\nWith various province and apt agency\nEach to pursue its own self-centering end.\nSome nurse the infant diamond in the mine;\nSome roll the genial juices through the oak;\nSome drive the mutinous clouds to clash in air,\nAnd rushing on the storm with whirlwind speed,\nYoke the red lightnings to their volleying car.\nThus these pursue their never-varying course,\nNo eddy in their stream. Others, more wild,\nWith complex interests weaving human fates,\nDuteous or proud, alike obedient all,\nEvolve the process of eternal good.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspAnd what if some rebellious, o'er dark realms\nArrogate power? yet these train up to God,\nAnd on the rude eye, unconfirmed for day,\nFlash meteor-lights better than total gloom.\nAs ere from Lieule-Oaive's vapoury head\nThe Laplander beholds the far-off Sun\nDart his slant beam on unobeying snows,\nWhile yet the stern and solitary Night\nBrooks no alternate sway, the Boreal Morn\nWith mimic lustre substitutes its gleam.\nGuiding his course or by Niemi lake\nOr Balda Zhiok, or the mossy stone\nOf Solfar-kapper, while the snowy blast\nDrifts arrowy by, or eddies round his sledge,\nMaking the poor babe at its mother's back\nScream in its scanty cradle: he the while\nWins gentle solace as with upward eye\nHe marks the streamy banners of the North,\nThinking himself those happy spirits shall join\nWho there in floating robes of rosy light\nDance sportively. For Fancy is the power\nThat first unsensualises the dark mind,\nGiving it new delights; and bids it swell\nWith wild activity; and peopling air,\nBy obscure fears of Beings invisible,\nEmancipates it from the grosser thrall\nOf the present impulse, teaching Self-control,\nTill Superstition with unconscious hand\nSeat Reason on her throne. Wherefore not vain,\nNor yet without permitted power impressed,\nI deem those legends terrible, with which\nThe polar ancient thrills his uncouth throng:\nWhether of pitying Spirits that make their moan\nO'er slaughter'd infants, or that Giant Bird\nVuokho, of whose rushing wings the noise\nIs Tempest, when the unutterable Shape\nSpeeds from the mother of Death, and utters once\nThat shriek, which never murderer heard, and lived.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspOr if the Greenland Wizard in strange trance\nPierces the untravelled realms of Ocean's bed\nOver the abysm, even to that uttermost cave\nBy mis-shaped prodigies beleaguered, such\nAs Earth ne'er bred, nor Air, nor the upper Sea:\nWhere dwells the Fury Form, whose unheard name\nWith eager eye, pale cheek, suspended breath,\nAnd lips half-opening with the dread of sound,\nUnsleeping Silence guards, worn out with fear\nLest haply 'scaping on some treacherous blast\nThe fateful word let slip the Elements\nAnd frenzy Nature. Yet the wizard her,\nArm'd with Torngarsuck's power, the Spirit of Good,\nForces to unchain the foodful progeny\nOf the Ocean stream;\u2014thence thro' the realm of Souls,\nWhere live the Innocent, as far from cares\nAs from the storms and overwhelming waves\nThat tumble on the surface of the Deep,\nReturns with far-heard pant, hotly pursued\nBy the fierce Warders of the Sea, once more,\nEre by the frost foreclosed, to repossess\nHis fleshly mansion, that had staid the while\nIn the dark tent within a cow'ring group\nUntenanted.\u2014Wild phantasies! yet wise,\nOn the victorious goodness of high God\nTeaching reliance, and medicinal hope,\nTill from Bethabra northward, heavenly Truth\nWith gradual steps, winning her difficult way,\nTransfer their rude Faith perfected and pure.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspIf there be Beings of higher class than Man,\nI deem no nobler province they possess,\nThan by disposal of apt circumstance\nTo rear up kingdoms: and the deeds they prompt,\nDistinguishing from mortal agency,\nThey choose their human ministers from such states\nAs still the Epic song half fears to name,\nRepelled from all the minstrelsies that strike\nThe palace-roof and soothe the monarch's pride.\nAnd such, perhaps, the Spirit, who (if words\nWitnessed by answering deeds may claim our faith)\nHeld commune with that warrior-maid of France\nWho scourged the Invader. From her infant days,\nWith Wisdom, mother of retired thoughts,\nHer soul had dwelt; and she was quick to mark\nThe good and evil thing, in human lore\nUndisciplined. For lowly was her birth,\nAnd Heaven had doomed her early years to toil\nThat pure from Tyranny's least deed, herself\nUnfeared by Fellow-natures, she might wait\nOn the poor labouring man with kindly looks,\nAnd minister refreshment to the tired\nWay-wanderer, when along the rough-hewn bench\nThe sweltry man had stretched him, and aloft\nVacantly watched the rudely-pictured board\nWhich on the Mulberry-bough with welcome creak\nSwung to the pleasant breeze. Here, too, the Maid\nLearnt more than Schools could teach: Man's shifting mind,\nHis vices and his sorrows! And full oft\nAt tales of cruel wrong and strange distress\nHad wept and shivered. To the tottering Eld\nStill as a daughter would she run: she placed\nHis cold limbs at the sunny door, and loved\nTo hear him story, in his garrulous sort,\nOf his eventful years, all come and gone.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspSo twenty seasons past. The Virgin's form,\nActive and tall, nor Sloth nor Luxury\nHad shrunk or paled. Her front sublime and broad,\nHer flexile eye-brows wildly haired and low,\nAnd her full eye, now bright, now unillumed,\nSpake more than Woman's thought; and all her face\nWas moulded to such features as declared\nThat Pity there had oft and strongly worked,\nAnd sometimes Indignation. Bold her mien,\nAnd like an haughty huntress of the woods\nShe moved: yet sure she was a gentle maid!\nAnd in each motion her most innocent soul\nBeamed forth so brightly, that who saw would say\nGuilt was a thing impossible in her!\nNor idly would have said\u2014for she had lived\nIn this bad World, as in a place of Tombs,\nAnd touched not the pollutions of the Dead.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp'Twas the cold season when the Rustic's eye\nFrom the drear desolate whiteness of his fields\nRolls for relief to watch the skiey tints\nAnd clouds slow-varying their huge imagery;\nWhen now, as she was wont, the healthful Maid\nHad left her pallet ere one beam of day\nSlanted the fog-smoke. She went forth alone\nUrged by the indwelling angel-guide, that oft,\nWith dim inexplicable sympathies\nDisquieting the heart, shapes out Man's course\nTo the predoomed adventure. Now the ascent\nShe climbs of that steep upland, on whose top\nThe Pilgrim-man, who long since eve had watched\nThe alien shine of unconcerning stars,\nShouts to himself, there first the Abbey-lights\nSeen in Neufch\u00e2tel's vale; now slopes adown\nThe winding sheep-track vale-ward: when, behold\nIn the first entrance of the level road\nAn unattended team! The foremost horse\nLay with stretched limbs; the others, yet alive\nBut stiff and cold, stood motionless, their manes\nHoar with the frozen night-dews. Dismally\nThe dark-red dawn now glimmered; but its gleams\nDisclosed no face of man. The maiden paused,\nThen hailed who might be near. No voice replied.\nFrom the thwart wain at length there reached her ear\nA sound so feeble that it almost seemed\nDistant: and feebly, with slow effort pushed,\nA miserable man crept forth: his limbs\nThe silent frost had eat, scathing like fire.\nFaint on the shafts he rested. She, meantime,\nSaw crowded close beneath the coverture\nA mother and her children\u2014lifeless all,\nYet lovely! not a lineament was marred\u2014\nDeath had put on so slumber-like a form!\nIt was a piteous sight; and one, a babe.\nThe crisp milk frozen on its innocent lips,\nLay on the woman's arm, its little hand\nStretched on her bosom.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspMutely questioning,\nThe Maid gazed wildly at the living wretch.\nHe, his head feebly turning, on the group\nLooked with a vacant stare, and his eye spoke\nThe drowsy calm that steals on worn-out anguish.\nShe shuddered; but, each vainer pang subdued,\nQuick disentangling from the foremost horse\nThe rustic bands, with difficulty and toil\nThe stiff cramped team forced homeward. There arrived,\nAnxiously tends him she with healing herbs,\nAnd weeps and prays\u2014but the numb power of Death\nSpreads o'er his limbs; and ere the noon-tide hour,\nThe hovering spirits of his Wife and Babes\nHail him immortal! Yet amid his pangs,\nWith interruptions long from ghastly throes,\nHis voice had faltered out this simple tale.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspThe Village, where he dwelt an husbandman,\nBy sudden inroad had been seized and fired\nLate on the yester-evening. With his wife\nAnd little ones he hurried his escape.\nThey saw the neighbouring hamlets flame, they heard\nUproar and shrieks! and terror-struck drove on\nThrough unfrequented roads, a weary way!\nBut saw nor house nor cottage. All had quenched\nTheir evening hearth-fire: for the alarm had spread.\nThe air clipt keen, the night was fanged with frost,\nAnd they provisionless! The weeping wife\nIll hushed her children's moans; and still they moaned,\nTill Fright and Cold and Hunger drank their life.\nThey closed their eyes in sleep, nor knew 'twas Death.\nHe only, lashing his o'er-wearied team,\nGained a sad respite, till beside the base\nOf the high hill his foremost horse dropped dead.\nThen hopeless, strengthless, sick for lack of food,\nHe crept beneath the coverture, entranced,\nTill wakened by the maiden.\u2014Such his tale.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspAh! suffering to the height of what was suffered,\nStung with too keen a sympathy, the Maid\nBrooded with moving lips, mute, startful, dark!\nAnd now her flushed tumultuous features shot\nSuch strange vivacity, as fires the eye\nOf Misery fancy-crazed! and now once more\nNaked, and void, and fixed, and all within\nThe unquiet silence of confus\u00e9d thought\nAnd shapeless feelings. For a mighty hand\nWas strong upon her, till in the heat of soul\nTo the high hill-top tracing back her steps,\nAside the beacon, up whose smouldered stones\nThe tender ivy-trails crept thinly, there,\nUnconscious of the driving element,\nYea, swallowed up in the ominous dream, she sate\nGhastly as broad-eyed Slumber! a dim anguish\nBreathed from her look! and still with pant and sob,\nInly she toiled to flee, and still subdued,\nFelt an inevitable Presence near.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspThus as she toiled in troublous ecstasy,\nA horror of great darkness wrapt her round,\nAnd a voice uttered forth unearthly tones,\nCalming her soul,\u2014'O Thou of the Most High\nChosen, whom all the perfected in Heaven\nBehold expectant\u2014'\n\n[The following fragments were intended to form part of the poem when finished.]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp'Maid beloved of Heaven!\n(To her the tutelary Power exclaimed)\nOf Chaos the adventurous progeny\nThou seest; foul missionaries of foul sire.\nFierce to regain the losses of that hour\nWhen Love rose glittering, and his gorgeous wings\nOver the abyss fluttered with such glad noise,\nAs what time after long and pestful calms,\nWith slimy shapes and miscreated life\nPoisoning the vast Pacific, the fresh breeze\nWakens the merchant-sail uprising. Night\nAn heavy unimaginable moan\nSent forth, when she the Protoplast beheld\nStand beauteous on Confusion's charm\u00e9d wave.\nMoaning she fled, and entered the Profound\nThat leads with downward windings to the Cave\nOf Darkness palpable, Desert of Death\nSunk deep beneath Gehenna's massy roots.\nThere many a dateless age the Beldame lurked\nAnd trembled; till engendered by fierce Hate,\nFierce Hate and gloomy Hope, a Dream arose,\nShaped like a black cloud marked with streaks of fire.\nIt roused the Hell-Hag: she the dew-damp wiped\nFrom off her brow, and through the uncouth maze\nRetraced her steps; but ere she reached the mouth\nOf that drear labyrinth, shuddering she paused,\nNor dared re-enter the diminished Gulph.\nAs through the dark vaults of some mouldered Tower\n(Which, fearful to approach, the evening hind\nCircles at distance in his homeward way)\nThe winds breathe hollow, deemed the plaining groan\nOf prisoned spirits; with such fearful voice\nNight murmured, and the sound through Chaos went.\nLeaped at her call her hideous-fronted brood!\nA dark behest they heard, and rushed on earth;\nSince that sad hour, in Camps and Courts adored,\nRebels from God, and Tyrants o'er Mankind!'\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspFrom his obscure haunt\nShrieked Fear, of Cruelty the ghastly Dam,\nFeverous yet freezing, eager-paced yet slow,\nAs she that creeps from forth her swampy reeds.\nAgue, the biform Hag! when early Spring\nBeams on the marsh-bred vapours.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp'Even so (the exulting Maiden said)\nThe sainted Heralds of Good Tidings fell,\nAnd thus they witnessed God! But now the clouds\nTreading, and storms beneath their feet, they soar\nHigher, and higher soar, and soaring sing\nLoud songs of triumph! O ye Spirits of God,\nHover around my mortal agonies!'\nShe spake, and instantly faint melody\nMelts on her ear, soothing and sad, and slow,\nSuch measures, as at calmest midnight heard\nBy ag\u00e9d Hermit in his holy dream,\nForetell and solace death; and now they rise\nLouder, as when with harp and mingled voice\nThe white-robed multitude of slaughtered saints\nAt Heaven's wide-open'd portals gratulant\nReceive some martyred patriot. The harmony\nEntranced the Maid, till each suspended sense\nBrief slumber seized, and confused ecstasy.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspAt length awakening slow, she gazed around:\nAnd through a mist, the relict of that trance\nStill thinning as she gazed, an Isle appeared,\nIts high, o'er-hanging, white, broad-breasted cliffs,\nGlassed on the subject ocean. A vast plain\nStretched opposite, where ever and anon\nThe plough-man following sad his meagre team\nTurned up fresh sculls unstartled, and the bones\nOf fierce hate-breathing combatants, who there\nAll mingled lay beneath the common earth,\nDeath's gloomy reconcilement! O'er the fields\nStept a fair Form, repairing all she might,\nHer temples olive-wreathed; and where she trod,\nFresh flowerets rose, and many a foodful herb.\nBut wan her cheek, her footsteps insecure,\nAnd anxious pleasure beamed in her faint eye,\nAs she had newly left a couch of pain,\nPale Convalescent! (Yet some time to rule\nWith power exclusive o'er the willing world,\nThat blessed prophetic mandate then fulfilled\u2014\nPeace be on Earth!) An happy while, but brief,\nShe seemed to wander with assiduous feet,\nAnd healed the recent harm of chill and blight,\nAnd nursed each plant that fair and virtuous grew.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspBut soon a deep precursive sound moaned hollow:\nBlack rose the clouds, and now, (as in a dream)\nTheir reddening shapes, transformed to Warrior-hosts,\nCoursed o'er the sky, and battled in mid-air.\nNor did not the large blood-drops fall from Heaven\nPortentous! while aloft were seen to float,\nLike hideous features looming on the mist,\nWan stains of ominous light! Resigned, yet sad,\nThe fair Form bowed her olive-crown\u00e9d brow,\nThen o'er the plain with oft-reverted eye\nFled till a place of Tombs she reached, and there\nWithin a ruined Sepulchre obscure\nFound hiding-place.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspThe delegated Maid\nGazed through her tears, then in sad tones exclaimed;\u2014\nThou mild-eyed Form! wherefore, ah! wherefore fled?\nThe Power of Justice like a name all light,\nShone from thy brow; but all they, who unblamed\nDwelt in thy dwellings, call thee Happiness.\nAh! why, uninjured and unprofited,\nShould multitudes against their brethren rush?\nWhy sow they guilt, still reaping misery?\nLenient of care, thy songs, O Peace! are sweet,\nAs after showers the perfumed gale of eve,\nThat flings the cool drops on a feverous cheek;\nAnd gay thy grassy altar piled with fruits.\nBut boasts the shrine of D\u00e6mon War one charm,\nSave that with many an orgie strange and foul,\nDancing around with interwoven arms,\nThe Maniac Suicide and Giant Murder\nExult in their fierce union!

Shriek'd Ambition's giant throng,\nAnd with them hissed the locust-fiends that crawled\nAnd glittered in Corruption's slimy track.\nGreat was their wrath, for short they knew their reign;\nAnd such commotion made they, and uproar,\nAs when the mad Tornado bellows through\nThe guilty islands of the western main,\nWhat time departing from their native shores,\nEboe, or Koromantyn's plain of palms,\nThe infuriate spirits of the murdered make\nFierce merriment, and vengeance ask of Heaven.\nWarmed with new influence, the unwholesome plain\nSent up its foulest fogs to meet the morn:\nThe

got a swingin' band\nYou can rock and roll to Dixieland\nThe customers knows it's the place to go\nDown at Papa Joe's\nA little waitress comes to set you down\nShe's got the best frog legs in town\nThere's a welcome sign hangin' on the door\nSo don't you be afraid to ask for more\n\nNow the only time Joe's closed at night\nIs when the Police come and turns out the light\nThey get a little mad 'cause they don't fight\nDown at Papa Joe's\n\nIt's thicker than fleas on a monkey's back\nBut the folks down there, they like it like that\nThey live it up and they all come back\nDown at Papa

race)\n\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-pe-pe-mm-meh\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\n\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-pe-pe-mm-meh\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee-ee-ee\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee-ee-ee\n\nI got into the rocket ship to see the Martian hop\nI saw the place a-shining red so there I made my stop\nBut as I opened up the door and climbed the ladder down\nI saw the Martians on the floor a-dancing to this sound\n\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee the Martian hop\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee-ee-ee\n\nIt seemed I was the first one there and so I was surprised\nTo see the Martians twist and stomp before my very eyes\nThey did the loco-motion and the hully gully, too\nI couldn't name a single dance the Martians wouldn't do\n\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee the Martian hop\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee-ee-ee\n\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee-ee-ee\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee-ee-ee\nYou might also likeAnd right around the stroke of twelve the dance had just begun\nThe Earth kids parked their spaceship down on Mars to have some fun\nAnd so I left my friends, the Martians, stomping on the ground\nAnd even though I'm back on Earth I still can hear this sound\n\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee the Martian hop\nEeeeee-ee-ee\nEe-ee-ee-ee\n\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-pe-pe-mm-meh\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\n\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-pe-pe-mm-meh\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\n\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-pe-pe-mm-meh\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\n\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-pe-pe-mm-meh\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-mir-mir\nPa-pa-mm-pe-pe-mm-meh\nPe-pe-mm-mir-mirEmbed"},

walk with you\nIn dreams, I talk to you\nIn dreams, you're mine all of the time\nWe're together in dreams, in dreams\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nBut just before the dawn\nI awake and find you gone\nI can't help

who could work it like that\nDo it perfectly slow and then perfectly fast\nI'm the only one that's out here, and I'm certain of that\nPlay me a beat, it gets turned into ash\nIf I play you a beat, it gets turned into trash\nAyy, hold up, wait\nWhen I'm on the track, I make no mistakes\nI can do the shit for like thirty-thousand hours\nFuck thirty-thousand words, I don't slow my breaks\nI go UK, then I make so many pounds\nEverybody think I'm overweight\nGettin' bread, see me eatin'\nBut I gotta go in, better hold my plate\nOoh, ooh, gotta switch up\nI'm so godly, I'm the bishop\nNow these haters wanna link up\nMy bars make them get the hiccups\nSo I had to run it up real quick\nFreestyle, gotta do some real shit real quick\nEverything I do is real big\n'Cause I gotta get the crowd to feel this,  real lit, real shit\nNowadays, they write me and I don't write it back\nSee my future demons like a psychic and a psychopath\nSwear I'm drivin' down the road and I might'a crashed\nDo the dash, always movin', don't know where to find me at\nHey, movin' on, gotta find a team\nEarnin' all my stripes like Camilla, but I'm lima beans\nAll these rappers 'bout to get fucked like they Riley Reid\nI'm your teacher, so be quiet or I am assignin' seats\nPioneer to the shit, Leif Eriksson\nI was even hunted, 2012, like I'm Jerry Lynn\nAll these places got me sneezin', need a Claritin\nUntil

That's nice to be given advice when I paint it\nHave twice much the fame, and\nI can't even comprehend that much in the future\nHatin' the teacher, but you loving the tutor\nEnter the game, I'm a fuckin' intruder\nStealin' these flows, man, I'm stuck as a looter\nProcrastinatin' 'cause my fucking computer\nNo willpower, I'm just stuck as a loser\n\n[Verse 4]\nSittin' alone at 3 AM\nChillin' on a late night is the weekday's friend\nMan, this shit is too wild, I \"must behave, Ben\"\nThat's what the teachers are preachin' to me, but even when\nI'm on the top of this drop and they're rocking the world with confidence\nAccomplishments topplin' everyone and you try stoppin' it?\n-Obvious there's a problem, and solvin' it just ain't up to me\nLuckily, I've been trained to test the system, don't you fuck with me\nI hope you like my company, I hope you do appreciate it\nI hope that one day, you'll see we made it\nNo, you cannot recreate it, all of this pain, I just alleviate it\nI'm just trying to find the mindset, grinding to be the greatest\nThat is why I'm strivin', livin', tryin', I'm buyin'\nI'm givin' dignity, cryin', I'm winnin', but feel like dyin'\nI'm shining, I'm like a diamond, but I am dead on the inside\nGuessin' now we'll rest with this, but set it on my big mind\n[Hook 1]\nAnd I'm in time\n-Workin' all my life, get that in line\nI'm tryna figure out, everyone get their pictures out\nNobody's gonna live without this shit on the incline\nI'm on the incline, I'm on the incline\nStay in your lane, you got your place and I'm in mine\nI'm on the incline, bitch, I'm on the incline\nNobody can really understand how my shit climb\n\n[Verse 5]\nHave I been livin' yet? Spendin' time on the internet\nI'm wastin', they hatin' it, I should be makin' it, aimin' for goals but takin' this shit instead\nI stay in bed, laughin' at stupid shit, ludicrous\nWho is this ten-year-old pregnant with two new kids? Why am I doing this?\nWhy the fuck do I care? I don't, but I kinda do\nI don't know what I try to do, but whatever it is, I say, \"Bye\", to you\nHey, me, I lied to you! Don't realize? Well it's time you do\nYou have no idea what I can do, when the skies are gray, you gotta find a blue\nYou gotta try to do, something to put you into a new positive mindset\nSet headlines, go wreck lines, pass deadlines, leave lines dead\nI guess that I digress, and I digest the way I'm blessed\nImpressed after I'm pressed, you seek intent for what I said\nBut I'm just gonna move on, get your groove on for my new song\nDo right, and you do wrong, got a big head, Jimmy Neutron\nYou try to hate, well, get in line, just delivered some quick rhymes\nSome straight bars, we have came far, but we lookin' up on the incline\n\n[Interlude 1]\nWater break\nI got a lot to say\nIt's been eleven minutes so far\nActually, it hasn't, it's been shorter\n\n[Verse 6]\nHow can\nI have a believable meaning\nWhen all of you livin' in paradise, livin' in luxury\nNobody seen it or  greet it?\nBut what if it's different? I mean, it's all seeming to be\nAnd it's in inconceivable dreaming\nI know it's so unbelievable, being\nStuck in this rare unachievable feeling\nThey givin' me something, I ended up leaving\nThey givin' me nothing, I ended up grievin'\nNo positive side, ended up seeing\nWhat life could be like from a  different lead in\nThank God for a cover zone\nSo I know when and where to cross it\nAll over the place\nI'm surprised I haven't lost it\n\n[Hook 2]\nYeah, ayy, and I'm feeling like I'm at the top, uh\nLivin' to the max now\nYeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud\nI'm steppin' up, I never back down, more focused on my background\nAnd the music and how my rap sounds, speak up, cut the track down\nGo till the end, I don't back out, stuck in the trap, figure that out\nAfter, I'll do the math now, it's garbage, take the trash out\nBut I'm here to stay till I pass out, blackout\n\n[Verse 7]\nOkay, it's time to go fast\nSo sit back and relax, and just maybe you'll get it\nAbout time, but maybe you're mad I said it\nYou gon' pay attention, cash or credit?\nI have to let it go back a second\nI have some lyrics in the past that I have to edit\nNow we're back in the middle of the track and fed it\nMix it up and if you talk, then, nah, forget it\nWe moved on, walked past the exit\nWant you to come back and pass a message\n-Never pack bags and trash, you left it\nKinda sucks that sometimes we have to end it\nMoney, never am glad I spent it\nIf I ever had told you I'm mad, I meant it\nIf you ever feel bad or sad, accept it\nThink back to the track and the rap that Ben did\nYeah, pretty obvious I'm killing it\nIf this isn't my time, then maybe you need a syllabus\nI'm feelin' all the rhythm, you can tell that I am into this\nVoice is more powerful than a million instruments\nSuddenly, lyrics go demon, like it's somebody else\nPeople want me to grow because of you\nBut I'm never going to level my endeavors to be better\nThan the people that never had trust in me\nYeah, uh\n\n[Hook 3]\nAnd I'm feeling like I'm at the top, yeah\nLivin' to the max now, uh\nYeah, that's how, and I'ma say it that loud\nI'm stepping up, I never back down, more focused on background\nAnd the music and how my rap sounds\n\n[Verse 8]\nSpeak up, and they're messing with the track now\nPeople are tellin' me that I'm fallin' short\nLooking back at you when you're missing all the cash now\nAnd I'm mad at the fact that\nI'm not in my right mind\nMeant to be a half-decent rapper\nBut I keep on saying all the wrong words at the right time\nLookin' at yourself, you never know what you might find\nLookin' at the sky in the middle of the nighttime\nI find so much life\nI wonder why I can't just find mine\nGot so many confusing questions\nSo much knowledge, I can't use the lessons\nI'm emerging out with a new profession\nI'ma do the best with my new perfection\nAnd I'm doin' it\nI'm moving onto this future shit\nThese hooligans are complete fools in that\nThey just don't understand that I am through with it\nImprovin' it, I'm improvin' it\nI got my brain, and I'm usin' it\nAnd I'ma make it out alive when I'm playin' and takin'\nAnd makin' this cash, that I'm tearing these tools to bits\nYou're clueless\nNinety percent of y'all ignorant\nKeeping your minds oh-so limited\nGet off your high horse, because it is time to figure it out\nSeeming so close, I can picture it now\nSuccess in my drink, and I'm sippin' it now\nEnvisioning deeper ambitions, and now\nI'ma get to it, that is what living's about\n\n[Interlude 2]\nUh, God!\nUh\nMy voice is gone already, shit\nAlright, ayy, ayy, ayy\n\n[Verse 9]\nThink I've got a consensus, bein' lost in the trenches\nAdolescent lessons expressin' God's job is to tempt us\nMakin' it hard to stay alive, it's so easy to die\nMakin' you hang your head low, but say, \"Reach for the skies\"\nLife is a walkin' contradiction, I see through its lies\nI'm just tryna tell the stories I've seen through its eyes\nI feel I'm forcing and feeding of off reasons to cry\nWith all this fake deep bullshit, I'm too eager to try\nYeah, everybody sendin' blessings in need of reply\nTryna sell their own tears, for they bleedin', they dry\nFuck your demons inside, I'm in need of the, \"Why?\"\nSo I can summarize my life through my breathing and sigh\nLike, oh well, I can say that I tried\nHopped into life and then I stayed for the ride\nSo many beautiful faces, but they vacant inside\nAnd I'm just patiently waiting for the day I decide, damn\nThis reminds me of days when I drive in L.A.\u200b\nI'm screamin', \"Hi\" to the sky up with a smile on my face\nNow I'm hidin' my face, I keep tryin' to trace\nAll of the steps that I had taken to findin' my place\nSwept out to oceans so lonely, waves feel like an embrace\nAnd now I'm lookin' at my mic like it's sent as a prophet\nI used to be an atheist, but that turned me agnostic\nRecently, I've been wondering if I've fuckin' lost it\nSee my friends from kindergarten go to rehab\nThat's the type of shit that makes you think back\nTo simpler times, blissfully ignorant minds\nBefore reality could ground us, we would live in the skies\nAnd as a- and as a kid, I never thought I'd be bein' like this (Nah)\nMan, as a kid, I never thought this would even exist\nI felt elusive, intangible, just steam in the mist\nAnd now I'm wakin' up feelin' I ain't even this shit\nYou only look at what you got once you see that it's lost\nAnd life's too gradual for me to believe in my sauce\nDon't understand rappers braggin', \"I got that paper on me\"\nMan, I got kids in schools who doin' presentations on me\nSo what the fuck you really value tryin' to take that from me?\nTo me, I'll take that over Rollies and makin' some money\nRain or sunny, I'ma do this every day, I study\nAnd write these lyrics till my brain is fuzzy, damn\nLike Tyler, Creator tweets, I just capitalize\nThese Romans tally up my hits with the capital 'I's\nThis is a natural high\nI see it comin' from afar, I'm still actin' surprised, but I ain't mastered the skies\nI wrote this album so much passion, I actually cried\nThey say 'cause I was never trappin', my rap is a lie\nThey think 'cause I'm a awkward kid, I'm invalid\nAs DJ Khaled's son receivin' a platinum plaque for bein' alive\nThrew out half of my album, it wasn't good enough\nShit, I mean it still isn't good enough\nI'm like a active volcano, I know I could erupt\nBut I guess I am not full enough, damn\nI swear, the higher you get, that's the lower you feel\nMan, that's more shit you gotta do, or you won't get a deal\nMan, that's more shit you gotta prove so they know that it's real\nThirty seconds of listenin', thinkin' you know how I feel\nYeah, said this a motherfucking thesis statement\nYeah, came a long way, I cannot be complacent\nEvery day I wake up stressed, I have to be the greatest\nAnd if not, then that's a day I truly feel I've wasted\nMost of the pressure on my shoulders is comin' from me\nSo when I die, I know I left us with something to leave\nSo when I wake up in the morning with something to see\nYeah, I got so much shit that I'm wantin' to be\n\n[Verse 10]\nBenny, Ben, Benjamin, Selena Gomez has said\nIf you ready, come get it then, everyone is jealous-\nMany want to get friends with them just in case he is relevant\nGot iPhone camera lenses to get the Instagram evidence\nYeah, I know I'm way too cocky\nBut I'm workin', I'm figurin' it all out\nSo when people say you can't, that makes you wanna get better\nThat's benefit of the doubt\nI've been on the top of this, never droppin' the bottom\nIt's opposite from the positives, got them from talkin' often\nAnd I'm locked in a pocket of all my thoughts, and they keep turnin' around\nAlways stoppin' my songs 'cause they keep burnin' the sound, I'm like-\nYeah, this is freedom of speech\nTryna' murder all the people who be keepin' the peace\nSacrifice your whole life 'cause you need a degree\nOpportunity in front of you, you need to achieve, I'm like-\nNah, I'm just tryna find some clarity\nApparently, it all has to do with popularity\nThere will be obstacles, primarily, people blinded to\nWhat is carefully being prepared to me\nSometimes you'll have hilarity, parody, and prosperity\nI'm askin' Hillary Clinton to marry me, powerful in the very least\n\n[Verse 11]\nGiving you all of my money, but never see legacy every day that I'm meant to see\nEveryone here is impaired, it is so scary and menacing, but I know enemy\n'Cause I go- uh, walking away, hopping block and what's often the case\nShot in the face, gun locked and loaded, been off at the race, droppin' the bass\nOff of the place, brought in a way, predict what I will probably say\nAnd at the end of the day, you still talking to me, so obviously, let the audience say\nSo let me explain this to those who came in, looking at the stages\nSeeing a white kid thinking he's famous, when they don't understand\nThat I take risks and I make hits, from basic playlist to the greatest\nEntertaining the nation, be patient whilst waiting for me to break in\n\n[Verse 12]\n-Re-energize, got lyrics to memorize\nStart an enterprise of better guys who cannot be successful and never try\nThat's my dream job, bein' lazy, just sittin'\nWith the TV on, they say that I'm bright like neon\nBut I ain't takin' responsibility, pay me for havin'\nLimited ability with little humility\nBut whatever I'm doin', it seems to be killin' me\nI'm unwillingly artistically fittin' into this history\nTryna show you why I'm better, but none of you believe me\nTryna win this gold and try hard, good game, gg\nYou beat me, and now you see me in 3D, but you can't feel me\nShowin' up on your device, control/option/delete\nConsider myself elite, measure myself in retweets\nI be talkin' way more chill so you can reach me\nInstead of pretendin' you understand what I am talkin' 'bout\nI'm the exhibit you kinda scared for, like a haunted house\nTryna show you something instead of just sittin' on the couch\nI'll be honest now, I rarely- end up walkin' out\nInto reality, in normality actually happily\nFound myself doin' nothing, and you don't laugh at me, why?\n'Cause, ideally, you would do the same thing\nNothing 'cause for- a brain that is amazing\nNot complainin', but the best part of life is not even livin' it\nLove sleepin' and just usin' the internet\nBut my time is limited, and I better figure this\nBefore I'm slippin' this opportunity, out my fingertips\nAnd let me just tell you what I have came to do\nTryna show you I can rap as fast as I'm able to\nTryna show you I can hop in here, like a kangaroo\nAnd say some stupid metaphors and leave after I'm breakin' through\nAnd if a major record label is looking at me\nI'm a nice guy with bad teeth, got a nice eye for bad beats\nI can rap fast, and rap slow\nI may make mistakes but everyone, has, so\nI'm like MJ back when he had the afro\nAlso, I'm not black, so... maybe not\nBut before everyone gets angry, stop\nI'm that person, then people naturally hate me, block\nAll the people who keep on going crazy off\n'Cause I won't be making amazing songs in a mainstream, got\nA lot of prominent features, I'm a confident speaker\nWith some dominant teachers\nI deserve to be a starter, but constantly on the bleachers\nI'm awfully small-achiever when I'm up on the spot, and eager\nThey be fearin' this every time that they hearin' it\nTo know that my lyrics have the precision to buildin' a pyramid\nSo when you're nearin' this, please let me know\nWhen I'm standin' here frozen, please let it go\nHear the metronome combined in the compilation\nTo unlock super-stardom and move all across the nation\nBut that is just a dream, and probably a combination\nOf a big ego and false encouragement on the way in\nBut when I'm playin', just know it's all a big game\nI was tryna blow up- bang! Have a big name\nBut when you think about it, it is all insane\nWhat can be created from chemicals in this brain\nBut when you look at me, you lackin' respect\nWhen I'm crackin' my neck so that I can rap to my chest\nHas in a breath, some say that it's magic, I step\nUntil I'm on the same stage, and you have it again\nBut, but when you think about the hall-of-fame\nYou think about how people used to sit and call you names\nAnd you check and wonder if it will be all the same\nStep back into reality, it all remains, damn\n\n[Interlude 3]\nAlright, I just spilled water on my computer right now\nOn my computer-'s breaking while I'm doing this thirty-thousands words shit\nHold on, uh\nGoddamn it\n\n[Verse 13]\nMy lyrics are not showing up on the screen, you knowin' just what I mean\nThis is off the top, I don't need to use no machines\nHold up, I know I can freestyle, but I can't do it forever\nBut I am very clever, okay, okay\nI'm gonna take a drink, if you're watchin' this, take a drink too\nThese are some shit' that you can drink to\nBut drink water unless you're of age\nYou know what I'm sayin'? Ayy\n\n[Interlude 4]\nOkay, okay\nUh\nUh\nAyy\n\n[Verse 14]\nI feel like I'm way too different, ridiculous\n-Most of humanity's made of idiots\nI barely even get myself, and you thinkin' you understand?\nYou think hiding behind a screen gives you the upper-hand?\nPlease... what I do is barely poetry\nThere's hope for me, I'm noticing people starting to notice me\nBut still consider me confident\nStill consider me ready and giving out all my flawlessness\nBut honestly, all of this is haunting me, probably\nIt is just my sense of myself wobbling, toppling\nInto awfully small pieces, normally all bleedin'\nIt's tragic and not fleetin', it follows me all evening\nIt's calling my name constantly, makes it so hard to stay awake\nI close my eyes and let it go, and it all fades away\nYeah, we're just tryna find that great escape\nTo get away from how we're living life day-to-day\nSome people find it in a drink or in a cup\nOr in some bling or in a drug, or in the things that give us love\nBut all I know is that it's tough\nAnd all I know is that this stuff isn't enough; it's way too much\n\n[Verse 15]\nI'm young and ill, like the dictator, man, what I gotta do to make the quick paper?\nThese kid-haters are like ten years old but still claim to be big players\nThat shit will make me go, but I'm aiming high, and you aiming low\nGot amazing rhymes and a crazy flow, and I may be lyin', but I came to show\nWhat I can do when I get on the mic, and I'm keeping it moving, you said I'm the hype\nAnd I'm seeing it through in successes inside, I don't take it for granted with plans in this life\n-Set on the wrong, forgetting the right, like, 2 AM in my head in the lights\nAhead of the best of 'em, lettin' the rest of 'em go off to bed in the night\n-Getting it like I be livin' in first class, I know that you never will surpass\n-Getting the worst task for this burnt trash whenever I work fast\nRemember the memos they sendin' and sendin' again and again  and they never will end it\nAnd say it is splendid, but never relented and every sentence I say is perfected\nTake a deep breath, 'cause I need that\nMost of y'all don't even care what I'm saying, you really just like how I speak fast\nMy bars are meta, I got meta bars with meta-eights and metaphors\nYou want better cores and better cars, but you don't know what I'm headin' towards\nSay that I am the king of this shit, crazy rhymes, they ain't thinkin' of this\nI'm singin' and rappin', and makin' it happen and makin' you laugh when I'm bringin' this shit\nTryna find the other way, y'all just waiting for another day\n'Cause what other fourteen-year-old had hit 100K?\nI'm making the most of a crazier flow, so many ways it could go\nI'm taking the throne and you chillin' and stayin' at home, I'm willing to make it my own\nI'm bakin' my cake, and you know that I'm eating it, even if staying up late is the needed bit\nReason is, stayin' the same, I'm just fleein' it, leavin' my life while I'm seeing these seasons switch\nMeaning, these people ain't feelin' rich, reach in the fire, I'm heatin' it\nPleasin' these liars, they've peaked, and so now they're recedin' agreein' to be a live without leading it\nFlow's so dope, I think it's time that we take a break\nWe all make mistakes and play some hate, I got 808s here to save the day\n'Cause I am on top of it, lost in my thoughts and I gotta be stoppin' it, rockin' it\nYou know my flow is so dominant, positive, confident, full of accomplishments, compliments\nAll of these offers is boring as fuck, though I am not a part of 'em\nStart a new part to the charts and I gotta be sure this art is the star on the map when I'm starting it\nBreaking it up, like cartilage, flow is so crazy, it's dope and you know it\nI know that you hate to admit it, but really, this shit is the business, rhymes keep darkenin'\nUnder the radar, you don't know what's comin', I'm comin' right up, and your bitch started runnin'\nI found to be part of a little of something called love, and I guess that's the art of it\nI try to go slow, but it don't work\n-Gettin' better, and that don't hurt, and you think I'm dead, and you're sure\nYou're salty and not kosher, slave to the corporates and the owners\nThis is live and love, call it Shrek, like the ogre\nHah, bitch, I have had enough, and I am sure I ain't mad enough\nForgettin' the rest while I'm gettin' success, and I look at the numbers, I add 'em up\nMy chart is like a parabola, thank you a lot for havin' us\nAnd so, every day, I take one step up, man, I am takin' the ladder up\n-Hundred K- get the plaque, lookin' forward, not heading back\nRemember what I had said is that we ain't givin' up, remember that\nHit me up when you're done whining, I'll hit you up when I'm done rhyming\nListen up, 'cause I'm combining all my skills into one finding\nWe run, grinding, you know we do, we got the shit that we're goin' through\nThese lyrics go over you, you  don't listen, so you don't know it's true\n'Cause we in, and we've done it, thousands, now we a hundred\nShoutout to Didac and Momo and the others\nShit, I consider them brothers, shit, I consider you all are my family\nShoutout to those who will stand with me, even when all of the others abandon me\nYeah, drama, we move past that, now I look at you with the last laugh\nBetter trackback, now I rap fast, so many skills in my backpack\nStarted off so terribly, now all of these people compare to me\nIn the past, I never anticipated what there would be\nAnd see ya, so long now, off to the end of the song now\nSee ya next at five-hundred and a million, it's on now\n\n[Interlude 5]\nIt's on now\nOh shit, I'm almost out of water\nThis is a hard- this a- real challenge\nThis like, physically difficult, ayy\n\n[Hook 4]\nWhen I walk up in the scene, I hear a orchestra\nNow everybody telling me I don't perform enough\nMy math teacher told me that I'd never be shit\nAnd now, I'm searched more then the quadratic formula\nI got the formula, I got the formula\nYou got the sauce, but goddamn, I got the formula, ayy\nPeople always asking Ben, \"Why you record so much?\"\nI got to fry up all these rappers quick, like, order up\n\n[Verse 16]\nFormula, like I'm Mr. Krabs\nI change and transform it up, you stuck in the past\nYeah, I wear Supreme goggles to my science lab\nUh, it hurts to write this song, 'cause I don't like to brag\nAnd now I've tied myself up, like a Nike Mag'\nPeople love to criticize me for the life I've had\nThey make it 'bout white and black, like I'm Michael Jack'\nI make these haters look confused, like it's Dora asking where Swipper at, ayy\nUh, bitch, I'm supreme, 'cause I got it on me, now they copy that, like a walkie-talkie\nAnd I'm feelin' like they really want to stop me, tryna fold my paper, like it's origami\nWanna justify the hate, they call me cocky, and I am, 'cause your girl call me, 'Papi'\nTryna take ti-t-uh.. paparazzi, I'm a fax machine up in a lot of copies\nAyy, still saying, \"Who would'a thought?\", like, who would'a guessed it?\nHaven't lifted weights in two years, but somehow, I'm always flexing\nIf you really want to find the answer to your question, here is where you should look:\nWant the secret to the sauce, motherfucker? Better go and find a cookbook\n\n[Verse 17]\nAyy, they doubt a fucker with a dream\nLooking to the stars for some money and a scheme, yeah\nLooking at the cars, all the hundreds and the greens\nSerpent's told you, \"No,\" and it's like nothing's as it seems\nGod damn, I guess I really thought he was the man\nI guess I really thought he had some fans, but that shit is all a sham\nAll that cash he stocked was from a scam\nAll the views he got was from some spam\nI've been living like, \"Man, ain't why he been doin' what he can?\nWhy ain't he just sticking to the plan?\nHow has he been living with no limits, getting millions by the minutes?\"\nI don't get it, I don't really understand\nI've been living like, \"Damn, he ain't getting money by the 'Gram\nI'll do better if I study my exams, do I really wanna stand\nNext to all these average fucking sad duds?\"\nSo I hate this motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one\n\n[Hook 5]\nYeah\nHate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he has one\nAyy\nJust because you gave up, doesn't mean I'm a backup\nUh, uh, uh\nFeel all my good times get replaced by the bad ones\nAnd so they hate a motherfucker with a dream, 'cause he\n\n[Verse 18]\n'Cause he been living this passion, I'ma just sit and imagine\nI've got a bitch on my lap and she listen to rap, and she really been digging my track, and I'm livin' for Snap\nThat shit invisible now, I'm unoriginal now\nI'm making a- minimum wage, this is literal AIDS, and I'm needin' to figure this out\nHow did I get to the stage? I wanna get up on stage, do this shit everyday\nAnd I won't care 'bout whatever they say, let 'em all pester away\nBut I just can't shoot my shot, got a bad gun\nSo I hate this motherfucker with a dream 'cause he has one\n\n[Verse 19]\nBy now, if you're still watching this shit\nYou are a boss and you deserve some applause for this shit\nBut we ain't over, we ain't done, though\nAm I takin' a break? Are you dumb, bro?\nWell, we nearin' 10K, but I still need 30K\nWhile all you sit around, I would rather work than play\nLyrics go through your dome, through your vertebrae\nHit you back and forth till you end up at the pearly gates\n\n[Interlude 6]\nThat was actually a pretty good bar\nI just wrote that like, right- a second ago, before I recorded this\nAyy, ayy\nYou know, just to add some- fill stuff in, uh\n\n[Hook 6]\nSometimes, I don't know what to think\nSometimes, I don't know what'll\nMake it okay, make it okay\nI'm snorin' all day for dreams, yeah, ayy\n\n[Verse 20]\nUh, I wake up pondering, damn, my mind is wandering\nAll these opportunities left squandered in my oxygen\nAll accomplishments left haunted in my lack of confidence\nOften is the result of falling under consciousness\nYou'd make babies cry, I make crazy lives\nYou're just angry, 'cause you're livin' in a fading lie\nAnd I've been feeling this energy, feeling that somebody's getting the penalty\nFearing that, one day ,you'll end up ahead of me, feeling that this is the end of me\nNo, will I tell you? No, never- I think I'm so clever\nBut in the grand scheme of things, I know that I'm no better\nBut I don't ever\nWant to go to show, just one mo' letter\nI'm a go-getter, I go get A's and get grades\nAnd get A's, then wake up, and get C's, but get paid\nUh... my life is so unusual\nTo most, it isn't suitable, to me, it's irrefutable\nCan't see me in a cubicle, I'd rather watch my funeral\nI'd rather go back to stab my own brains out back in utero\nUh, but you know that I'm capable\nYou know I'ma pounce at any chance that is available\nFeeling so unique and I think it's not explainable\nNo one hears my lyrics, and says, \"OMG, relatable!\"\nNo, that's not what I'm here to give\nBeen waiting years for this, you're about to experience\nSomething that I've spent time, money and thought on\nLearned about all the times money had thought wrong\nKinda funny, it's long gone, but time is crummy and not long\nI ain't lucky, I'm not calm, not by a long-shot\n-Out on the inside, see me on the outside\nAlways think I'm positive, and never see the downsides\nIt's 'bout time you know the truth, you couldn't be further from it\nGet your head out your own ass, you couldn't be further up it\n\n[Interlude 7]\nOkay\nOkay, okay, we're like thirty minutes in\nThirty minutes, but we got thirty-thousand, bro\nFuck\n\n[Verse 21]\nYeah, I'm the key to the equation, bitch, you better beware\nI'm like the 'e' that equals all other emcees squared\nI'm just me, performing in front of empty chairs\nBut y'all see, so all of y'all better get prepared\nI got so much opportunity, I gotta make the most of it\nShoes made of the banana peels, I feel like I'm supposed to slip\nMan, in this life, we all climbing unstable ladders\nIt's not about who goes faster, but it's 'bout the man who'll hold his grip\nDamn, I got a crazy ass work ethic\nBlocked out south east and west, leave in one direction\nI finished my album, and people saying they lovin' it\nFuck with it, but I took it down and redid it to perfection\nWe all students of rap, but we don't learn lessons\nLike a Eskimo's jacket, all them be forgettin'\nWanted to fuck a nun, started like really badly\nAnd I didn't even have to ask for me to get her blessing- that's a horrible bar\nCan't stand me 'cause I crossed them up, their ankles hurtin'\nYeah, uh... yeah, yeah, I'm an amazing person\nI base my motivation on my favorite angels words a-\n-bout how I'ma make it, gettin' famous, man, that thing's for certain\n\n[Verse 22]\nYou keep your standards low, man, I keep my standards high\nWanna' get on any action, like the Brazzers camera guy\nCan't deny I'm fucking insane, sometimes I fantasize\nHow it would be like to be normal, but I just randomize\nAnd analyze my situations, leaving people paralyzed\nAnd take a step out of bed, meanwhile I'm at my paradise\nAmerica is very nice, but I'd like to see the world\nBut I'd like to get out in to the open and meet my girl\n\n[Verse 23]\nIn a Mercedes Benz with his lady friends\nCrazy Ben is just chillin' with them women, you know they be tens\nThey be tens or more, they be tens or more\nI like to talk to all these people 'cause they marvel at my metaphors\nIt's free speech, I can say what I want\nBut these listenin' are tryna make me pay for my talk\nThey don't like what I'm doin', they don't appreciate the banter\nI get it, you're jealous, but listen, 'cause I'm the answer, uh\nMotherfucker, I'ma live for the right time\nFuck that, I'ma live for the moment\nSitting here in the middle of the night time\nMy mind puzzled with the thoughts that be flowin'\nDamn, I've been livin' in a headache\nBitches never listenin', they saying that they ready\nBut I can never believe them\nGot these goals and they can never achieve 'em\nHow can your dreams come true if you ain't willin' to dream 'em?\nDamn, that's a lot of shit to think about\nSuddenly, company starts to come to me, wondering\nWhat I'm doin', next I realize, that shit, I gotta figure out\nMade some beats, I gotta hit 'em out, heh\nGot these dreams that I'm livin' out\nIn my mind's eye, givin' out lots of songs with responses\nThat I never pictured, wow, damn, damn\nThis beat's way too holy to rap over\nMental block, my mind's capacities, that's lower\nYour raps slower, they lack closure, they lack substance\nLike a printer without toner, y'all fillin' pages that have nothin'\nOoh, but I have got somethin' to tell you\nI ain't got some money or bullshit to sell you\nSpeakin' from late nights, I'm thinkin' of Drake's life\nWatching these interviews, thinkin' one day I might\nBe on that stage right beside all these players\nShit's up to me, I won't hide it in prayers\nI'll prove it in music I use to influence\nI do this way harder than people assumin'\nResumin' my writin', viewin' this lightin'\nThat puts me to be in the view of the hidin'\nI do what they're likin', but that makes 'em hate me\nNo matter what I do, they just mistake the\nReason I'm flowin', the reason I start up\nNot just for the fame, and the money, the star bucks\nAnd- damn, I ain't talking about the coffee place\nMost to these rappers only write this shit using copy/paste\nI'd have made a lot of songs that go to waste, uh\nI just need a home run, I already loaded bases\nI have got so many cases\nBeen visiting, living in so many places\nExperiences that I made me to Emmy\nBen, B-E-N, please, I hope you let me\nBe me, I ain't greedy or needy\nBelieve me, I just want to be on your TV\nGet on my level, 'cause I need a new staircase\nDamn, yeah, I've been looking at their space\nAnd, one day, I'll be there\nI know what I'm doin', I'm already prepared\n\n[Verse 24]\nI've been waiting like thirty-thousand years\nTryna make the world listen, so make sure that you can hear\nI'm trying to take a passion out of turning my career\nI'm concerned without my fear, but I earned it, and I'm here\nNow I earned it, and I'm here to stay\nI'm coming in, you're trying to clear the way, another chance, another fucking year to play\nNot even seventeen, eighteen, I'm so near to fame\nNot really, look at all the shit, I just hear this day\nI don't know- I look at the future nostalgically\nI'd cure every disease, and y'all still wouldn't be proud of me\nUndoubtably know how to be what I am about to be\nTo say that money talks, and that shit seems so damn loud to me\n\n[Verse 25]\nRecently, I have been feeling alienated\nMy songs out of this world, people claim that aliens made 'em\nBut, baby, I'm crazy, don't hate me- don't hate me 'cause I'm different\nHate me because you hate me, then maybe we can live with it\n\n[Verse 26]\nPeople say that this is the biggest thing to hop on the screen\nAll will scream, overreacting, like it's a drama scene\nY'all are mean, and since the best quality is honesty\nPromise me that it's the reality, where's Keanu Reeves?\nTrapped in a Matrix, it's how I felt sometimes back in the ages\nWhen I would rap on the stages, and now, I laugh at those days, and\nI'm moving on, grooving while you lose the song\nMove along, nothing to see here except some stupid pawns\nWho could bomb this whole place up with one great lung?\nOne great tongue, I am that one great one\nOn vacation, I vacate to a location\nFar away from where people just may run\nA light to go to where there is no one, no one, no fun\nOh, son, I'm tryna be me, and so young\nI can murder this beat with no gun, go run\nI've too many problems to handle, here, hold one\nI just hop onto the rap boat, but that ship has now sunks\nAnd now, punks can make loud junk, Uptown Funk\nWas a great song, catchy at first, but that radio station\nPlaying it, making it just get to the worst\nMy head's gonna burst if I hear it again, and I'm sure\nI'll throw my speakers on the ground, denting the earth\nAnd now, I'm ending this verse, and I mean it\nNow the ink of this pen just keeps on bleeding, yeah\n\n[Verse 27]\nGood rappers never get to see the light of day\nBut when you selling sex and a gimmick, they'll sign you right away\nI'll obey... nah, whatever, man, what is this?\nI'm rapping so fast to the max, and I'm playing my tracks so that people will know I mean business\nNobody witness anything better than when I am showing you this shit\nKnow I'm suspicious, because I'll be flowing and growing like, \"Oh, this kid is big\"\nKnow how I live it, go on a mission, y'all better listen\nTill I'm ahead of this shit by all of the inches, 'eah\nAnd when I'm, uh... I'm telling y'all that I got a story\nGod ignores me, stop the glory, cop is for me in auditory\nNot visually, typically, the original me\nSo unforgivable, so inexplicable, obvious the pinnacle digitally\nDamn, that was fast, felt so jammed till I unpacked\nAnd I'm just tryna prove to you the things that I can move on the track\nAnd I'm trying to get a record deal, never ever felt so real\nWhenever we're the guests to feel, whenever f-this gets to feel\nSo different, and I'm loving it, time to change and discover it\nTime to make a difference, and I'm living it, so I'm up for it\nI always talk to them other kids, them other kids couldn't understand me\nOne path, making a knot, ain't gonna stop for plan B\n\n[Interlude 9]\nI wrote that one a long time ago\nThat was the first time that I looked- that I- I looked at those again\nBut you know, I still- I'm not that rusty, not that rusty\nI- actually... classic!\n\n[Verse 28]\nWe just living in the solar system\nOne big world here to hold the wisdom\nOne big jail to control the victims\nWe're all here, tryna find a soul in rhythm\nA voice in writing and a choice deciding\nWhether or not to follow what the boys are likin'\nWhat the girls are doing, what we gotta be exposed to\nThink about who you are, and it's so true\nThink about the people who you think have really known you\nDo they really know you? Do you even know you?\nDamn, that shit is like a Jaden Smith tweet\nSometimes you gotta think 'bout how crazy shit be\nAnd lately, it seems to make the extremes\nSo prominent and dominant in making big dreams\nI'm seeing aliens scream\nWhen I go to sleep, man, my brain needs fixing\nBut I'm just tryna make it in life\nFuck you to people who be saying it like\nI ain't making it right? Take a vacation and hike\nI'm chilled out, bitches, getting famous despite\nThe fact that I'm young and little bit nerdy\nAnd I know a lot of people would consider me early\nI'm just a little kid working tryna configure my searches\nTryna deliver my purpose, and take a shit on my burdens\nI'm just me, no, I ain't a victim to hurting\nI just see all the people living and burning\nSo be free, time to be a little bit nervous\nIt don't matter if you're scared, 'cause this shit is disturbing\nAnd I get it, I don't wanna ever forget it\nGuessin' I'm headed towards the ending, and I know it is splendid\nSo I'll see ya 'round, underachievers\nHop on my wagon, 'cause we dragging late, we gotta be leaving, man\n\n[Hook 8]\nSo basically, I do this for fun, they ain't making me\nI'm tryna have a blast, 'cause we growing so fast, we be getting my career from A to Z\nAnd, basically, I'm great you see, I made my life at the age of three\nBut now, what am I meant to do when my own fanbase are hating me?\n\n[Verse 29]\nI've been see' 'ple- misusing their fans, like crooks\nManipulating their audience to catch that hook\nThey'll believe anything that you'll tell them, look-\nYou can feed them shit so you can sell your book, haha\nBut no shots fired, though\nNothing wrong with a little bit of lying though\nI mean... look at Fox News\nThat's the whole premise of their entire show\nBut no political shit, I always do just enough, I'm a minimalist\nMakin the most of my minimums, winnin' 'em, got a couple of synonyms to help you listen to original bits\nI got a lot of digital prints, man, your own homedog is a literal bitch\nBut I'm filling the syllables, it's a little predictable, 'cause I've written this shit for all of the cynical kids\nI got time! Maybe a little too much of it\nBut you know that I'm tryna move up a bit\nPeople look at me and say my potential has\nGot a big max, and you know that I'm lovin' it\nSo fire, can't handle me with oven mitts\nUnderground, blessed if you discovered it\nFlow is so unique, I got so much to do\nNot like any other kid\n\n[Hook 9]\nAyy, yo, what you say, though?\nYeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though\nYeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low\nYou know I'm comin' to them checks like Usain Bolt\n\n[Verse 30]\nWait so, inhale the fumes while I paint this\nPicture: me, I'm sitting in my room and I'm anxious\nTryna make my moves while they huge and they famous\nI knew this shit I couldn't do, I was jaded\nNow, somehow, I'm next up, yeah, I'm blessed up\nNow I wake up and I'm fly, I don't dress up\nNow I'm fly and my opponents better catch up\nI get my checks, uh, all y'all need to step up\nI-I-I-I-I-I- remember tryna practice my cadence\nIn tracks I was makin', I had to be patient\nEverybody said that shit was trash, and they were right\nBut I turned that shit and made a right, shit is day and night\nNow I gotta take a flight to Vegas, might not stay the night\nEverybody see me eatin', now they wanna take a bite\nSo I'm like, \"Okay... no way\"\nYeah, when it comes to this shit, man, I don't play\nI'm like Houdini in my Ghost, you can't see me, I'm gone\nBall so hard, I gotta wear my Yeezys to prom\nYouTube bitches asking me to retweet they song\nI'm the reason people got Spotify Premium on\n\n[Hook 9]\nLike, ayy, yo, what you say, though?\nYeah, it's Quadeca comin' straight out the Bay, though\nYeah, when I walk out in the town, I gotta stay low\nYou know I'm runnin' to them checks like Usain Bolt\n\n[Verse 31]\nSo I'm like okay, nah, no way\nWhen it comes to that shit, man, I don't play\nIf you ask me how I got it I will say\nI got the drive, yeah, really get out of the roadway, uh\n\n[Interlude 8]\nDamn\nSome of these\nAre too slow and also too fast\nWhatever\n\n[Verse 31]\nI'm out of order, three hoes like I'm Santa Claus\nPull up on your bitch, Bape hoodie with a camouflage\nHey now, yo, what's the play now?\nI'm tryna slide, I ain't talkin' 'bout a playground\nYeah, I remember all them days I would stay down\n20K's chillin' in my PayPal\nSo what the fuck you wanna say- you wanna say now?

I hear 'em followin' loudly\nAnd I don't wanna hear about this shit again\nI guess that's the way it goes when they stalk me\nAnd do anything to try and stop me\nI did nothing wrong, but that's how it goes\nWhen a basic bitch try to block me, uh\n\n[Verse 35]\nLivin' life, but you're stayin' the same\nHow you expect yourself to go take the fame\nMake your name, but you don't take the pain\nYou wanna be unique but not make a change\nLike, what? How you expect to go through this\nThink about the goals, man, why you wanna do this\nSo stupid and useless if you never lose it\nRisk yourself a little for the movement- when did I write-\nThis ain't the Ode to Joy, this the ode to success\nDon't know if there is a God, but I know that I'm blessed\nAnd I'm open to \"No\" and I'm open to \"Yes\"\nI'll do whatever I can to go to the best\nThat will go to the right and go to the left\nNo doubt I'ma show up at night instead of goin' to bed\nWhen I know that I'm right, I'm explodin' my chest\nI keep on loadin' the time and it goes over my head\nI think \"No, why do I even try these things?\nI need shiny things like diamond rings\nAnd flying rings and pricey bling- uh\nThat is what drives these strings\nI'm so- I'm so lively and lazy at the same time\nSayin' somethin' sane and crazy in the same rhyme\nNever go to practice, don't phase me till it's gametime\nLearnin' this life will amaze me, how I made my\nDay, find a minute, I'm livin', winnin' and willin'\nTo spit rhythm and chillin', they get so pissed with me, I'm either villain\nNo, they not kiddin', and no, I'm not quittin', I know I'm just sittin'\nSittin' with a dream, and maybe\nMaybe just see then, see then where the dream could take me\nBut I know it can't, I know it takes luck, I'm angry!\nWhy am I just the B of the A-team\nAt the feet of the mainstream?

Ayy\nLet's gom random shit, ayy\n\n[Verse 39]\nI take no credit for anything that I do\nThat's how I live life with a positive attitude\nThat's why I've seem pissed, but I'm never gettin' mad at you\nThat's the reason that people mirror my attributes\nWhat I contribute to the world is\nSome crazy shit nobody else's world did\nAnd I'm just tryin' to spread some peaces love\nBut, man, it's really hard, 'cause you need some luck\nI've been waitin', 'cause this is\nThe best time for me to be layin' out of business, uh\nAnd I'm breathin' in the air, but it all tastes tainted\nWhen all of this time is wasted, really ain't wasted\n\n[Interlude 14]\nThis is trash, I have- don't know when I wrote this\nI think I wrote this in like 2013, this is how far back I-\nThis is how far back we are, I'm not even gonna rap this\nLet's do something else- oh, okay, let's do this\n\n[Verse 40]\nIt's bumpin', bumpin', this beat is just so disgustin'\nYou leavin' me in the lust of my meet-and-greet for my lovin'\nI'm enchanted, damn, this beat is just full of somethin'\nThat's makin' me want to get up, and breath in all the percussion\nMan, I'm dancing, dancing, man, I'm feelin' the rhythm\nDroppin' my head, fancy snares, then when it hits 'em\nIt really gets in my bloodstream, life just makes sense to me\nBass and a good groove is really a great recipe\nCan't mess with me, no one- feelin' too good in the moment\nFeelin' new when I go in, and feelin' blue when it's over\nAnd I'm noddin' yes, and then I am applaudin' next\nAnd then, I'm tryna to mentally send God a text\nLike, \"Hey, what's up, God? I don't know if you're real\nBut, listen to how this bumps, you supposedly feel\nLike a god\u2014 well, you get what I'm sayin'?\"\nAnd goddamn, I just can't really express when I'm playing\n\n[Hook]\nI said it's bumpin', uh- y'all just go for a ride\nWe feelin' good at the top, man, we more than high\nYeah, we be feelin' it, know that this the realest shit\nAll the pain, this is healin' it, love it, I'm never leavin' it\nIt's bumpin'\n\n[Verse 41]\nReally, this is bumpin' to me\nYou ain't feelin' it, so then you just get up and you leave\nBut this is something to me, so don't come runnin' to me\nI said we comin' in this shit like we be fuckin' the dream\nNo, never mind, probably not\nBut I constantly got energy that's lost in my thoughts\nAnd I'm not gonna stop, and yes, this may be costing a lot\nBut lookin' at the end result, man, we've accomplished a lot\nAnd no, I'm not gonna regret a thing after this, I'm still trying to master this\n'Cause now, I'm known as that weird-ass rappin' kid\nThe fact of it is that it is really just a giant hobby\nSomething for me to be original, not a lyin' copy\nTryna make some shit where you can really get your head nodding\nVerses so fire that- 's when it's done, it's- left sobbing\nBlah, blah, blah, it's uh- we just a work-in-progress\nSome of my shit means shit and other words are nonsense\nBut now we easin' up, we got a beat that's bumpin'\nSee me stuntin' while I'm flowin', we adjustin', see me bluffin'\nEvery day, man, see me bluffin', that is what I do\nListen to some good shit, tryna make a substitute\nI got so much stuff to do, and I am just a youngin' too\nWho just hopped on the scene? Everybody wonders who\nBut all I know is that we find a safety in rhythm\nAnd that is the reason that I am making a shipment\nI said it's bumpin'\n\n[Interlude 15]\nNearin'- we're nearin' an hour\nIf you're still watchin' this shit, I love you, I actually, like, love you\nLong time, okay\n\n[Hook 13]\nI said, I'm married to the game, but I only just met her\nHopin' that my shit get better, but I'm just gonna\nMove with it, ride with it\nIt's my life, the only burden is the time limit\nFuck it, I'm livin', ayy, I said, \"Fuck it, I'm livin'\"\nPeople getting mad, just because, yeah, I'm winnin'\nJust because, yeah, I'm winnin', they're stuck-up, and I get it\nJust because your life stucks, stop corrupting mine with it\nI messed-I messed up the punchline, it's actually really good\nJust because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, ayy\nAyy, ayy, uh\nJust because your life sucks, stop corrupting mine with it, uh\n\n[Verse 42]\nAnd how am I meant to keep my workflow up?\nIf a girl shows up, all my world blows up\nI'm just sittin' and waitin', instead of becomin' the greatest\nTryna find a brand new motherfuckin' deal\nAll you bitches fake, all my numbers real\nAll my shit is punchin' in your stomach, like a meal\nAm I married to the game if I can't afford a ring?\nIt's all very much the same if I can't afford to sing\nNow, it's scary for a king, damn, I said, it's scary for a king, even\nThey call me odd, but I bring even\nI bring reason to believe, and you're eatin' it up for free, and\nThe meaning is rarely seen and no line can be drawn between 'em, I don't show seasons\nYeah, I am me no matter what, and that can grow pleasin'\nI'm barely close to anybody, I don't know people\nMan, I don't know people who so equal\nI don't know nobody who doesn't own evil\nMan, that is just a truth and a lie\nA truth and a lie, somethin' like the blue in the sky\nOr a suit and a tie, yeah, I'm new to this life, I'm new to my mind\nNew to the time, man, I'm like the proof in disguise\nAnd uh, I'm- lookin' at all of this shit\nOh, you should know I'm not fallin' for this\nYou get discouraged for one minute\nAnd the next one, you be callin' it quits\nAnd I'll probably get rich If I focus enough\nYou close-minded, let's open it up\nAnd all of these people assumin' 'bout what I be doin'\nBut they do not know what is up\nUh, I just wish\nThat they'd go away\nAnd I won't obey\nNo, I will never ever show the way\nAnd I will try to mask it up\nWith other jokes on fucking jokes\nAlways playin' G'\nBut now I'm movin' onto other notes\n\n[Interlude 16]\nMy voice is fucking hurting\nIt's hurting a lot, I'm not- I haven't had vocal training\nSo I don't know how to- just do this for a long period of time\nWithout causing damage to my vocal cords, but who gives a fuck?\nMan, I just live it up\nI'm gonna go a little bit quieter now\nUh-huh\nYeah\n\n[Chorus 1]\nAll of these people keep on changin'\nAll of these times and different phases\nAll of these lights on all these stages\nAll of these sights is so amazing\nYeah, I've seen at least a million faces\nA million times, a million places\nBut when it's all said and done\nI look and I wonder why, uh\n\n[Verse 43]\nEveryone knows that it's so amazing\nAll the support is my motivation\nCompared to the big people at the Capital\nMy name is spelt in lower cases\nPeople loved me before I made it\nPeople liked it before they watched it\nI'm wantin' way too much more than I have\nAnd I'm glad, because now, I will never stop it\nMan on a mission, and I g- vision\nOf talking a lot of wisdom, man, I gotta listen\nGotta follow and be the leader, and tomorrow\nI'll be the teacher when they need the feature\nGot flow, and it's so damn crazy\nPeople consider me so amazing\nI'm holding control and then folding them verses\nIt hurts because I am on loaded bases\nAdvanced shit, I know the basics\nAlready know them, they're overrated\nMeanwhile, I am not rated at all, so we hopin'\n'Cause now I am open for game, and\nI'm charged up\nI ain't Drake, but I'm on the worst behavior\nSo many people they know the players\nDon't know the game and don't know the makers\nDon't know the fakers, but who cares?\nI'm not here to cater, I'm here to improve and show that I'm greater\nI'm here to go move and just go on the layers\nAnd bitch, I am going so later\nI got time\nMy own lyrics, I got mine\nAnd I'm on time for the wrong lines\nAnd I'm not crying, so let's start grinding, let's go\n\n[Hook 14]\nI've been all on my own\nAll on my own, people keep calling my phone\nWanting to know when I'll be the star of the show\nBut I'm all my own, yeah\nAnd I don't want to talk about it, stop to doubt it\n'Cause the world is awfully crowded, but-\nThe ghost of me is haunting the throne\nSo I'll make it there all on my own\n\n[Verse 44]\nMy intermission is mixing with intermissions\nAnd following intuition conflicting with my decision\nAnd it is more than just business, 'cause this is for self-approval\nAnd it is to make it look like I'm living for something useful\nAnd it's sad, but you know it's true for most of you\nAppearances distracting from the goals that you should go pursue, the growing movement\nTo a new type of thing that you can gain from\nTo push away the past and the places that you came from\nDay one for me was like six months ago-\n\n[Interlude 17]\nOh, holy shit!\nI actually reached the end of the beat\nBut I still have, like\nTen-thousand more words\nHold on, I gotta pause this\nHold on, three, it's still one take\n\n[Verse 45]\n-Past and the places that you came from\nDay one for me was like six months ago\nLook at where we been, but imagine where one can go\nIt's not fun to know that we just livin' to die\nIt's not fun to know that we just livin' to die\nWe now know how much money you can give for a lie\nGive for a look, but how much can you give for an eye?\nWhat's the point of feeling shit if you just living to cry?\nSo, get your ass up, 'cause it's time to make it happen\nAlways been shitty at rappin', but I practice for the passion, man\n\n[Hook 15]\nYeah, I've been living life all on my own, bitch\nUh, I ain't the star of the show, bitch\n\n[Verse 46]\nI know like four people who truly respect the grind\nAnd it's usually left to climb in a newly perfected rhyme\nAnd then if time is money then free time ain't really free\nAnd all my fan' pissed 'cause my own lyrics ain't really me\n-Stemming from a branch of a wishlist on my Christmas tree\nI want to be what's taunting me, but sorry, I'm a mini-me\nIn the face of my full potential, that is the biggest me\nBigger than you, bigger than anybody in history\nThe challenge is a challenge, the fact that you got to maximize\nTo satisfy your lavish life and have a crazy magic time\nAnd luckily, I'm so damn young, 'cause, man, I have the time\nTo learn from my mistakes and grow into a mastermind\nI'm trying to master my craft, and the problem is that I've got\nSeveral different things to potentially make my job\nI want to make the MLS, and also have a mili' subs\nAnd also get a mili' plays, and maybe make a mili' bucks\nA million- shit, all we ever want is more, really\nAnd once I get three million, I want four milli'\nIt's so silly, it's so tricky, this whole cycle\nWe can never be happy, but that is so vital\n\n[Interlude 18]\nUh\nThose are actually some good lyrics, uh\n\n[Verse 47]\nRebirth, feet hit the earth, my knees hurt\nThey're weaker than previously, her\nBreathing seems to be burnt like free CDs were\nBefore we could be searched, I'm like \"Please, just please work\"\nLike a lenient slave owner\u2014 that's edgy, like gravestones, oh, you get me\nI saved dough for a Bentley, t'ere more than a Chevy\nI play- I play-\n-Who cares about flexin' if you ain't holding it heavy?\nUh, I've been tryin' to prove to all of the people I knew who didn't like what I do\nDisgusted like, \"Ew\", yeah, this shit goes outta you, plans have now all become true\nI'm seeing them through, man, that's the reason I do, all of the things that I do\nIt's not for a crew, not for a god or a demon, I've really been needing a clue\nFillin' these shoes, reading these pieces and news, damn, this shit really is screwed\nIt gives me the blues whenever I'm shielding my eyes from the darkness and don't get a view, uh\nBut if ignorance is really bliss, then why this ignorance be killin' kids?\nAnd why this ignorance that's clearly vicious is not given shit and ends up innocent?\nThat shit really is ridiculous, it's magnificently fucked up\nBut nobody wants to tough it up, I haven't seen it goin' down, it's comin' up\nL\u2014\n\n[Verse 48]\n\u2014cay to the Vatican, havin' them\nGood times and bad times with New Romans, do that again, well, that was when\nI was so young, too young to really know fun\nBut so what? I guess that's what happens when you grow up\nDry your eyes and wipe your nose up\nJust keep drinking till you throw up, no, we won't judge\nBut we all just want to be loved and somehow get validated by those we hate\nSuch a twisted system that we've been given to operate\nI've been really thinkin' and figurin' out who's not a fake\nWash away the thoughts I made along the way, it all has changed\nYeah, and now we lookin', it's so far away\nAnd it's so far away\n\n[Hook 16]\nThis a civil war\nIt's a fuckin' civil war\nYeah, we be aimin' to the peace\nSo what we killin' for?\nYeah, anymore\nWhat we even livin' for?\nYeah, they be murderin' for peace\nThat is a civil war\n\n[Verse 49]\nYou know- you know they be lookin' at me right now\nLike the sewer system, they about to pipe down\nI've been writin' my essays, my webpage\nYeah, I call that a new construction site now\nBlue's Clues, man, I think I gotta find out\nAll these questions, man, I really wanna hide out\nOr I wanna drop out, maybe learn a lot 'bout\nMy shit before I wait to see it die out\nDamn, I-I just wanna go along\nI'm holdin' strong, I know- I know I'm not the boldest one\nI'm old enough, I'm growin' up, bars so sick, they throwin' up\nThey know what's up, now, I'm in the- now I'm really doin' the\nDoin' in the big leagues like I got drafted\nBefore the year-round hype over March Madness\nWanna get it to where these girls strippin' down\nLike it's no big deal, like we takin' liberal arts classes\nThey be sayin', \"Damn, Ben really got savage\"\nNo, but unlike you, I am not average-\n\n[Interlude 19]\nHold on, I have to fix this fucking instrumental\nThis is so mental, hold on, I have to fix it real quick\nI'm gonna fix it, take a pause\nUh, yeah, ayy\n\n[Verse 50]\nI'm addicted to the screen and the validations\nOf people who are thirteen in another nation\nI've been looking for acceptance in the message\nOr a comment on a video, it seems to be wasted\nLike Internet track meets, they erased it\nLook at this shit, I've just recently made it\nThat how it goes when I'm beatin' and breathin'\nAcheivin' and keep on succeedin', they hate it\nY'all lousy and can't breathe all that smoke, bro\nYou doubt me, but you'll see where I go, so\nAllow me to break free from my own dome\nTo get out and be me, believe in my own zone\nThings become intense in the heat of the ozone\nIt's surroundin' me, I need to go home, so\nCan I pretty please just be al-alone?\nNobody to retweet, delete on my home phone\nI ain't gon'-I ain't gon' hop on that drug shit\nWhen they all claimin' they love it, uh\nI ain't gon' hop on that loud shit\nWhen I know I ain't about it, uh\nYeah, they cannot take this away now\nThey have something to say now\nYou cannot order this shit on a takeout\nAll of these bitches is fake now\n\n[Verse 51]\n\u2014My clothes is Japanese, I wear it casually\nAnd I'm a killer on the mic, might cause a couple casualties\n-All I'm needin' is a beat to make your fuckin' salary\nMan, I said, \"Fuck the peanut gallery, I got a fuckin' allergy\"\nTrappin' out my PayPal, make it Friends and Family\nNow I'm so hot, I need some oven mitts, ain't safe to handle me\nNow I made my checks from Spotify, they pay me handsomely\nI got the mic up to my brain to help maintain my sanity, okay\nEverybody 'round me, they been wasting my time, ayy\nPull up to the functions, see they face when I rhyme, ayy\nEveryone's a critic on my case all the time\nDo it by myself, I don't need a way to get signed\n\n[Hook 17]\nBitch, I'm clouted up, yeah, I'm clouted up, ayy\nGet my numbers up, gotta add 'em up, ayy\nUntil I get it, I ain't never packin' up, no\nAnd they all comin' for my blood like Dracula, ayy\n\n[Verse 52]\nOkay, I'm backin' this, not maskin' shit, now everybody wanna go package shit\nI don't give a fuck, you know I'm abstinent, I'ma fuck the whole game up on accident\nWait a minute, shit, I'm too passionate, so they stand up for my anthems, no Kaepernick\n'Member when they used to all laugh at this, now they hit me up like, \"What the fuck's happenin'?\nYeah, I had to sacrifice a lot of sleep\nBecause a lot of people want a lot from me\nYeah, standing in the way of who I wanna be\nNow random strangers recognize me when I cross the street\n\n[Verse 53]\nSo many memories, do you remember these\nMoments way back in the time?\nTrapped in the back of my mind\nI am so happy to grind, I am so happy to find\nSo much experience now that I'm passing the lines\nNow that I'm grasping the signs\nI have been laughing a lot, got nothing to hide\nNo, I've got nothing to hide\nBitch, I am stuck, left behind\nI need a drive, yeah, I need something to ride\nFill my own bank account, shit that I'm making now\nPuttin' it off to the side\nFeeling alive, yes, I am breathing the air\nAnd I'm feeling so careless, but I can't\nLet go\nDamn\nEvery morning\nI'm wanting to drop out\nBut I can't stop now\nI put too much work in this shit to go pop out\nSo I walk down five different paths every day\nJust need the one, it's only begun\nNo, I'm not going away\nNo, I'm not gonna- 's uh- say\nThat this shit is going badly at all\nI'm glad that I fall\nI love the ref, but I am mad at the call\nI'm mad at the call\nYeah, I'm having it all, I'm traveling far\nAnd I'm practicing hard\nNever goin' back to the start, never goin' back to the start\n\n[Verse 54]\nUh, yeah\nPutting my mind on the table\nNo, I am so able, I'm lining the cables\nI got the horsepower, but tied to the stables, get by with no label\nI do the mixing and mastering\nWriting and rapping and making it happen, I'm\nEating my cake, and I'm having it\nReal emotion, I'm tapping in, passionate\nAnd I am working my hardest\nIt's already started, yes, I am being an artist\nI'm feeling the largest\nI'm feeling the largest\n\n[Part III]\n\n[Intro 3]\nOh!\nIs that the final beat change up?\nAlright, we were on that last beat for like an hour\nFor lit-

good\n\nMany a man would face his gun and many a man would fall\nThe man who shot Liberty Valance\nHe shot Liberty Valance\nHe was the bravest of them all\n\nThe love of a girl can make a man\nStay on when he should go, stay on\nJust trying to build a peaceful life\nWhere love is free to grow\n\nBut the point of a gun\nWas the only law that Liberty understood\nWhen the final showdown came to pass\nA law book was no good\n\nAlone and afraid she prayed that he'd\nReturn that fateful night, ah, that night\nWhen nothing she said could keep\nHer man from going out to fight\n\nFrom the moment a girl gets to be full grown\nThe very first thing she learns\nWhen two men go out to face each other\nOnly one returns\nYou might also likeEveryone heard two shots ring out\nThe shot made Liberty

TWO\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0THE VERDURINS QUARREL WITH M. DE CHARLUS\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After dinner, I told Albertine that, since I was out of bed, I might as well take the opportunity to go and see some of my friends, Mme. de Villeparisis, Mme. de Guermantes, the Cambremers, anyone in short whom I might find at home. I omitted to mention only the people whom I did intend to see, the Verdurins. I asked her if she would not come with me. She pleaded that she had no suitable clothes. \u201cBesides, my hair is so awful. Do you really wish me to go on doing it like this?\u201d And by way of farewell she held out her hand to me in that abrupt fashion, the arm outstretched, the shoulders thrust back, which she used to adopt on the beach at Balbec and had since then entirely abandoned. This forgotten gesture retransformed the body which it animated into that of the Albertine who as yet scarcely knew me. It restored to Albertine, ceremonious beneath an air of rudeness, her first novelty, her strangeness, even her setting. I saw the sea behind this girl whom I had never seen shake hands with me in this fashion since I was at the seaside. \u201cMy aunt thinks it makes me older,\u201d she added with a sullen air. \u201cOh that her aunt may be right!\u201d thought I. \u201cThat Albertine by looking like a child should make Mme. Bontemps appear younger than she is, is all that her aunt would ask, and also that Albertine shall cost her nothing between now and the day when, by marrying me, she will repay what has been spent on her.\u201d But that Albertine should appear less young, less pretty, should turn fewer heads in the street, that is what I, on the contrary, hoped. For the age of a duenna is less reassuring to a jealous lover than the age of the woman\u2019s face whom he loves. I regretted only that the style in which I had asked her to do her hair should appear to Albertine an additional bolt on the door of her prison. And it was henceforward this new domestic sentiment that never ceased, even when I was parted from Albertine, to form a bond attaching me to her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I said to Albertine, who was not dressed, or so she told me, to accompany me to the Guermantes\u2019 or the Cambremers\u2019, that I could not be certain where I should go, and set off for the Verdurins\u2019. At the moment when the thought of the concert that I was going to hear brought back to my mind the scene that afternoon: \u201cGrand pied de grue, grand pied de grue,\u201d\u2014 a scene of disappointed love, of jealous love perhaps, but if so as bestial as the scene to which a woman might be subjected by, so to speak, an orang-outang that was, if one may use the expression, in love with her \u2014 at the moment when, having reached the street, I was just going to hail a cab, I heard the sound of sobs which a man who was sitting upon a curbstone was endeavouring to stifle. I came nearer; the man, who had buried his face in his hands, appeared to be quite young, and I was surprised to see, from the gleam of white in the opening of his cloak, that he was wearing evening clothes and a white tie. As he heard my step he uncovered a face bathed in tears, but at once, having recognised me, turned away. It was Morel. He guessed that I had recognised him and, checking his tears with an effort, told me that he had stopped to rest for a moment, he was in such pain. \u201cI have grossly insulted, only to-day,\u201d he said, \u201ca person for whom I had the very highest regard. It was a cowardly thing to do, for she loves me.\u201d \u201cShe will forget perhaps, as time goes on,\u201d I replied, without realising that by speaking thus I made it apparent that I had overheard the scene that afternoon. But he was so much absorbed in his own grief that it never even occurred to him that I might know something about the affair. \u201cShe may forget, perhaps,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I myself can never forget. I am too conscious of my degradation, I am disgusted with myself! However, what I have said I have said, and nothing can unsay it. When people make me lose my temper, I don\u2019t know what I am doing. And it is so bad for me, my nerves are all on edge,\u201d for, like all neurasthenics, he was keenly interested in his own health. If, during the afternoon, I had witnessed the amorous rage of an infuriated animal, this evening, within a few hours, centuries had elapsed and a fresh sentiment, a sentiment of shame, regret, grief, shewed that a great stage had been passed in the evolution of the beast destined to be transformed into a human being. Nevertheless, I still heard ringing in my ears his \u2018grand pied de grue\u2018 and dreaded an imminent return to the savage state. I had only a very vague impression, however, of what had been happening, and this was but natural, for M. de Charlus himself was totally unaware that for some days past, and especially that day, even before the shameful episode which was not a direct consequence of the violinist\u2019s condition, Morel had been suffering from a recurrence of his neurasthenia. As a matter of fact, he had, in the previous month, proceeded as rapidly as he had been able, a great deal less rapidly than he would have liked, towards the seduction of Jupien\u2019s niece with whom he was at liberty, now that they were engaged, to go out whenever he chose. But whenever he had gone a trifle far in his attempts at violation, and especially when he suggested to his betrothed that she might make friends with other girls whom she would then procure for himself, he had met with a resistance that made him furious. All at once (whether she would have proved too chaste, or on the contrary would have surrendered herself) his desire had subsided. He had decided to break with her, but feeling that the Baron, vicious as he might be, was far more moral than himself, he was afraid lest, in the event of a rupture, M. de Charlus might turn him out of the house. And so he had decided, a fortnight ago, that he would not see the girl again, would leave M. de Charlus and Jupien to clean up the mess (he employed a more realistic term) by themselves, and, before announcing the rupture, to \u2018b \u2014\u2014-off\u2019 to an unknown destination\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For all that his conduct towards Jupien\u2019s niece coincided exactly, in its minutest details, with the plan of conduct which he had outlined to the Baron as they were dining together at Saint-Mars le V\u00eatu, it is probable that his intention was entirely different, and that sentiments of a less atrocious nature, which he had not foreseen in his theory of conduct, had improved, had tinged it with sentiment in practice. The sole point in which, on the contrary, the practice was worse than the theory is this, that in theory it had not appeared to him possible that he could remain in Paris after such an act of betrayal. Now, on the contrary, actually to \u2018b \u2014\u2014\u2014 off\u2019 for so small a matter seemed to him quite unnecessary. It meant leaving the Baron who would probably be furious, and forfeiting his own position. He would lose all the money that the Baron was now giving him. The thought that this was inevitable made his nerves give away altogether, he cried for hours on end, and in order not to think about it any more dosed himself cautiously with morphine. Then suddenly he hit upon an idea which no doubt had gradually been taking shape in his mind and gaining strength there for some time, and this was that a rupture with the girl would not inevitably mean a complete break with M. de Charlus. To lose all the Baron\u2019s money was a serious thing in itself. Morel in his uncertainty remained for some days a prey to dark thoughts, such as came to him at the sight of Bloch. Then he decided that Jupien and his niece had been trying to set a trap for him, that they might consider themselves lucky to be rid of him so cheaply. He found in short that the girl had been in the wrong in being so clumsy, in not having managed to keep him attached to her by a sensual attraction. Not only did the sacrifice of his position with M. de Charlus seem to him absurd, he even regretted the expensive dinners he had given the girl since they became engaged, the exact cost of which he knew by heart, being a true son of the valet who used to bring his \u2018book\u2019 every month for my uncle\u2019s inspection. For the word book, in the singular, which means a printed volume to humanity in general, loses that meaning among Royal Princes and servants. To the latter it means their housekeeping book, to the former the register in which we inscribe our names. (At Balbec one day when the Princesse de Luxembourg told me that she had not brought a book with her, I was about to offer her Le P\u00eacheur d\u2019Islande and Tartar\u00een de Tarascon, when I realised that she had meant not that she would pass the time less agreeably, but that I should find it more difficult to pay a call upon her.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding the change in Morel\u2019s point of view with regard to the consequences of his behaviour, albeit that behaviour would have seemed to him abominable two months earlier, when he was passionately in love with Jupien\u2019s niece, whereas during the last fortnight he had never ceased to assure himself that the same behaviour was natural, praiseworthy, it continued to intensify the state of nervous unrest in which, finally, he had announced the rupture that afternoon. And he was quite prepared to vent his anger, if not (save in a momentary outburst) upon the girl, for whom he still felt that lingering fear, the last trace of love, at any rate upon the Baron. He took care, however, not to say anything to him before dinner, for, valuing his own professional skill above everything, whenever he had any difficult music to play (as this evening at the Verdurins\u2019) he avoided (as far as possible, and the scene that afternoon was already more than ample) anything that might impair the flexibility of his wrists. Similarly a surgeon who is an enthusiastic motorist, does not drive when he has an operation to perform. This accounts to me for the fact that, while he was speaking to me, he kept bending his fingers gently one after another to see whether they had regained their suppleness. A slight frown seemed to indicate that there was still a trace of nervous stiffness. But, so as not to increase it, he relaxed his features, as we forbid ourself to grow irritated at not being able to sleep or to prevail upon a woman, for fear lest our rage itself may retard the moment of sleep or of satisfaction. And so, anxious to regain his serenity so that he might, as was his habit, absorb himself entirely in what he was going to play at the Verdurins\u2019, and anxious, so long as I was watching him, to let me see how unhappy he was, he decided that the simplest course was to beg me to leave him immediately. His request was superfluous, and it was a relief to me to get away from him. I had trembled lest, as we were due at the same house, within a few minutes, he might ask me to take him with me, my memory of the scene that afternoon being too vivid not to give me a certain distaste for the idea of having Morel by my side during the drive. It is quite possible that the love, and afterwards the indifference or hatred felt by Morel for Jupien\u2019s niece had been sincere. Unfortunately, it was not the first time that he had behaved thus, that he had suddenly \u2018dropped\u2019 a girl to whom he had sworn undying love, going so far as to produce a loaded revolver, telling her that he would blow out his brains if ever he was mean enough to desert her. He did nevertheless desert her in time, and felt instead of remorse, a sort of rancour against her. It was not the first time that he had behaved thus, it was not to be the last, with the result that the heads of many girls \u2014 girls less forgetful of him than he was of them \u2014 suffered \u2014 as Jupien\u2019s niece\u2019s head continued long afterwards to suffer, still in love with Morel although she despised him \u2014 suffered, ready to burst with the shooting of an internal pain because in each of them \u2014 like a fragment of a Greek carving \u2014 an aspect of Morel\u2019s face, hard as marble and beautiful as an antique sculpture, was embedded in her brain, with his blossoming hair, his fine eyes, his straight nose, forming a protuberance in a cranium not shaped to receive it, upon which no operation was possible. But in the fulness of time these stony fragments end by slipping into a place where they cause no undue discomfort, from which they never stir again; we are no longer conscious of their presence: I mean forgetfulness, or an indifferent memory\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile I had gained two things in the course of the day. On the one hand, thanks to the calm that was produced in me by Albertine\u2019s docility, I found it possible, and therefore made up my mind, to break with her. There was on the other hand, the fruit of my reflexions during the interval that I had spent waiting for her, at the piano, the idea that Art, to which I would try to devote my reconquered liberty, was not a thing that justified one in making a sacrifice, a thing above and beyond life, that did not share in its fatuity and futility; the appearance of real individuality obtained in works of art being due merely to the illusion created by the artist\u2019s technical skill. If my afternoon had left behind it other deposits, possibly more profound, they were not to come to my knowledge until much later. As for the two which I was able thus to weigh, they were not to be permanent; for, from this very evening my ideas about art were to rise above the depression to which they had been subjected in the afternoon, while on the other hand my calm, and consequently the freedom that would enable me to devote myself to it, was once again to be withdrawn from me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As my cab, following the line of the embankment, was coming near the Verdurins\u2019 house, I made the driver pull up. I had just seen Brichot alighting from the tram at the foot of the Rue Bonaparte, after which he dusted his shoes with an old newspaper and put on a pair of pearl grey gloves. I went up to him on foot. For some time past, his sight having grown steadily weaker, he had been endowed \u2014 as richly as an observatory \u2014 with new spectacles of a powerful and complicated kind, which, like astronomical instruments, seemed to be screwed into his eyes; he focussed their exaggerated blaze upon myself and recognised me. They \u2014 the spectacles \u2014 were in marvellous condition. But behind them I could see, minute, pallid, convulsive, expiring, a remote gaze placed under this powerful apparatus, as, in a laboratory equipped out of all proportion to the work that is done in it, you may watch the last throes of some insignificant animalcule through the latest and most perfect type of microscope. I offered him my arm to guide him on his way. \u201cThis time it is not by great Cherbourg that we meet,\u201d he said to me, \u201cbut by little Dunkerque,\u201d a remark which I found extremely tiresome, as I failed to understand what he meant; and yet I dared not ask Brichot, dreading not so much his scorn as his explanations. I replied that I was longing to see the room in which Swann used to meet Odette every evening. \u201cWhat, so you know that old story, do you?\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet from those days to the death of Swann is what the poet rightly calls: \u2018Grande spatium mortalis aevi.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The death of Swann had been a crushing blow to me at the time. The death of Swann! Swann, in this phrase, is something more than a noun in the possessive case. I mean by it his own particular death, the death allotted by destiny to the service of Swann. For we talk of \u2018death\u2019 for convenience, but there are almost as many different deaths as there are people. We are not equipped with a sense that would enable us to see, moving at every speed in every direction, these deaths, the active deaths aimed by destiny at this person or that. Often there are deaths that will not be entirely relieved of their duties until two or even three years later. They come in haste to plant a tumour in the side of a Swann, then depart to attend to their other duties, returning only when, the surgeons having performed their operation, it is necessary to plant the tumour there afresh. Then comes the moment when we read in the Gaulois that Swann\u2019s health has been causing anxiety but that he is now making an excellent recovery. Then, a few minutes before the breath leaves our body, death, like a sister of charity who has come to nurse, rather than to destroy us, enters to preside over our last moments, crowns with a supreme halo the cold and stiffening creature whose heart has ceased to beat. And it is this diversity among deaths, the mystery of their circuits, the colour of their fatal badge, that makes so impressive a paragraph in the newspapers such as this:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe regret to learn that M. Charles Swann passed away yesterday at his residence in Paris, after a long and painful illness. A Parisian whose intellectual gifts were widely appreciated, a discriminating but steadfastly loyal friend, he will be universally regretted, in those literary and artistic circles where the soundness and refinement of his taste made him a willing and a welcome guest, as well as at the Jockey Club of which he was one of the oldest and most respected members. He belonged also to the Union and Agricole. He had recently resigned his membership of the Rue Royale. His personal appearance and eminently distinguished bearing never failed to arouse public interest at all the great events of the musical and artistic seasons, especially at private views, at which he was a regular attendant until, during the last years of his life, he became almost entirely confined to the house. The funeral will take place, etc.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From this point of view, if one is not \u2018somebody,\u2019 the absence of a well known title makes the process of decomposition even more rapid. No doubt it is more or less anonymously, without any personal identity, that a man still remains Duc d\u2019Uz\u00e8s. But the ducal coronet does for some time hold the elements together, as their moulds keep together those artistically designed ices which Albertine admired, whereas the names of ultra-fashionable commoners, as soon as they are dead, dissolve and lose their shape. We have seen M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 speak of Cartier as the most intimate friend of the Duc de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, as a man greatly in demand in aristocratic circles. To a later generation, Cartier has become something so formless that it would almost be adding to his importance to make him out as related to the jeweller Cartier, with whom he would have smiled to think that anybody could be so ignorant as to confuse him! Swann on the contrary was a remarkable personality, in both the intellectual and the artistic worlds; and even although he had \u2018produced\u2019 nothing, still he had a chance of surviving a little longer. And yet, my dear Charles \u2014\u2014-, whom I used to know when I was still so young and you were nearing your grave, it is because he whom you must have regarded as a little fool has made you the hero of one of his volumes that people are beginning to speak of you again and that your name will perhaps live. If in Tissot\u2019s picture representing the balcony of the Rue Royale club, where you figure with Galliffet, Edmond Polignac and Saint-Maurice, people are always drawing attention to yourself, it is because they know that there are some traces of you in the character of Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to more general realities, it was of this foretold and yet unforeseen death of Swann that I had heard him speak himself to the Duchesse de Guermantes, on the evening of her cousin\u2019s party. It was the same death whose striking and specific strangeness had recurred to me one evening when, as I ran my eye over the newspaper, my attention was suddenly arrested by the announcement of it, as though traced in mysterious lines interpolated there out of place. They had sufficed to make of a living man some one who can never again respond to what you say to him, to reduce him to a mere name, a written name, that has passed in a moment from the real world to the realm of silence. It was they that even now made me anxious to make myself familiar with the house in which the Verdurins had lived, and where Swann, who at that time was not merely a row of five letters printed in a newspaper, had dined so often with Odette. I must add also (and this is what for a long time made Swann\u2019s death more painful than any other, albeit these reasons bore no relation to the individual strangeness of his death) that I had never gone to see Gilberte, as I promised him at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s, that he had never told me what the \u2018other reason\u2019 was, to which he alluded that evening, for his selecting me as the recipient of his conversation with the Prince, that a thousand questions occurred to me (as bubbles rise from the bottom of a pond) which I longed to ask him about the most different subjects: Vermeer, M. de Mouchy, Swann himself, a Boucher tapestry, Combray, questions that doubtless were not very vital since I had put off asking them from day to day, but which seemed to me of capital importance now that, his lips being sealed, no answer would ever come\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d Brichot went on, \u201cit was not here that Swann met his future wife, or rather it was here only in the very latest period, after the disaster that partially destroyed Mme. Verdurin\u2019s former home.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, in my fear of displaying before the eyes of Brichot an extravagance which seemed to me out of place, since the professor had no share in its enjoyment, I had alighted too hastily from the carriage and the driver had not understood the words I had flung at him over my shoulder in order that I might be well clear of the carriage before Brichot caught sight of me. The consequence was that the driver followed us and asked me whether he was to call for me later; I answered hurriedly in the affirmative, and was regarded with a vastly increased respect by the professor who had come by omnibus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! So you were in a carriage,\u201d he said in solemn tones. \u201cOnly by the purest accident. I never take one as a rule. I always travel by omnibus or on foot. However, it may perhaps entitle me to the great honour of taking you home to-night if you will oblige me by consenting to enter that rattletrap; we shall be packed rather tight. But you are always so considerate to me.\u201d Alas, in making him this offer, I am depriving myself of nothing (I reflected) since in any case I shall be obliged to go home for Albertine\u2019s sake. Her presence in my house, at an hour when nobody could possibly call to see her, allowed me to dispose as freely of my time as I had that afternoon, when, seated at the piano, I knew that she was on her way back from the Trocad\u00e9ro and that I was in no hurry to see her again. But furthermore, as also in the afternoon, I felt that I had a woman in the house and that on returning home I should not taste the fortifying thrill of solitude. \u201cI accept with great good will,\u201d replied Brichot. \u201cAt the period to which you allude, our friends occupied in the Rue Montalivet a magnificent ground floor apartment with an upper landing, and a garden behind, less sumptuous of course, and yet to my mind preferable to the old Venetian Embassy.\u201d Brichot informed me that this evening there was to be at \u2018Quai Conti\u2019 (thus it was that the faithful spoke of the Verdurin drawing-room since it had been transferred to that address) a great musical \u2018tow-row-row\u2019 got up by M. de Charlus. He went on to say that in the old days to which I had referred, the little nucleus had been different, and its tone not at all the same, not only because the faithful had then been younger. He told me of elaborate jokes played by Elstir (what he called \u2018pure buffooneries\u2019), as for instance one day when the painter, having pretended to fail at the last moment, had come disguised as an extra waiter and, as he handed round the dishes, whispered gallant speeches in the ear of the extremely proper Baroness Putbus, crimson with anger and alarm; then disappearing before the end of dinner he had had a hip-bath carried into the drawing-room, out of which, when the party left the table, he had emerged stark naked uttering fearful oaths; and also of supper parties to which the guests came in paper costumes, designed, cut out and coloured by Elstir, which were masterpieces in themselves, Brichot having worn on one occasion that of a great nobleman of the court of Charles VII, with long turned-up points to his shoes, and another time that of Napoleon I, for which Elstir had fashioned a Grand Cordon of the Legion of Honour out of sealing-wax. In short Brichot, seeing again with the eyes of memory the drawing-room of those days with its high windows, its low sofas devoured by the midday sun which had had to be replaced, declared that he preferred it to the drawing-room of to-day. Of course, I quite understood that by \u2018drawing-room\u2019 Brichot meant \u2014 as the word church implies not merely the religious edifice but the congregation of worshippers \u2014 not merely the apartment, but the people who visited it, the special pleasures that they came to enjoy there, to which, in his memory, those sofas had imparted their form upon which, when you called to see Mme. Verdurin in the afternoon, you waited until she was ready, while the blossom on the horse chestnuts outside, and on the mantelpiece carnations in vases seemed, with a charming and kindly thought for the visitor expressed in the smiling welcome of their rosy hues, to be watching anxiously for the tardy appearance of the lady of the house. But if the drawing-room seemed to him superior to what it was now, it was perhaps because our mind is the old Proteus who cannot remain the slave of any one shape and, even in the social world, suddenly abandons a house which has slowly and with difficulty risen to the pitch of perfection to prefer another which is less brilliant, just as the \u2018touched-up\u2019 photographs which Odette had had taken at Otto\u2019s, in which she queened it in a \u2018princess\u2019 gown, her hair waved by Lenth\u00e9ric, did not appeal to Swann so much as a little \u2018cabinet picture\u2019 taken at Nice, in which, in a cloth cape, her loosely dressed hair protruding beneath a straw hat trimmed with pansies and a bow of black ribbon, instead of being twenty years younger (for women as a rule look all the older in a photograph, the earlier it is), she looked like a little servant girl twenty years older than she now was. Perhaps too he derived some pleasure from praising to me what I myself had never known, from shewing me that he had tasted delights that I could never enjoy. If so, he was successful, for merely by mentioning the names of two or three people who were no longer alive and to each of whom he imparted something mysterious by his way of referring to them, to that delicious intimacy, he made me ask myself what it could have been like; I felt that everything that had been told me about the Verdurins was far too coarse; and indeed, in the case of Swann whom I had known, I reproached myself with not having paid him sufficient attention, with not having paid attention to him in a sufficiently disinterested spirit, with not having listened to him properly when he used to entertain me while we waited for his wife to come home for luncheon and he shewed me his treasures, now that I knew that he was to be classed with the most brilliant talkers of the past. Just as we were coming to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s doorstep, I caught sight of M. de Charlus, steering towards us the bulk of his huge body, drawing unwillingly in his wake one of those blackmailers or mendicants who nowadays, whenever he appeared, sprang up without fail even in what were to all appearance the most deserted corners, by whom this powerful monster was, evidently against his will, invariably escorted, although at a certain distance, as is the shark by its pilot, in short contrasting so markedly with the haughty stranger of my first visit to Balbec, with his stern aspect, his affectation of virility, that I seemed to be discovering, accompanied by its satellite, a planet at a wholly different period of its revolution, when one begins to see it full, or a sick man now devoured by the malady which a few years ago was but a tiny spot which was easily concealed and the gravity of which was never suspected. Although the operation that Brichot had undergone had restored a tiny portion of the sight which he had thought to be lost for ever, I do not think he had observed the ruffian following in the Baron\u2019s steps. Not that this mattered, for, ever since la Raspeli\u00e8re, and notwithstanding the professor\u2019s friendly regard for M. de Charlus, the sight of the latter always made him feel ill at ease. No doubt to every man the life of every other extends along shadowy paths which he does not suspect. Falsehood, however, so often treacherous, upon which all conversation is based, conceals less perfectly a feeling of hostility, or of sordid interest, or a visit which we wish to look as though we had not paid, or an escapade with the mistress of a day which we are anxious to keep from our wife, than a good reputation covers up \u2014 so as not to let their existence be guessed \u2014 evil habits. They may remain unknown to us for a lifetime; an accidental encounter upon a pier, at night, will disclose them; even then this accidental discovery is frequently misunderstood and we require a third person, who is in the secret, to supply the unimaginable clue of which everyone is unaware. But, once we know about them, they alarm us because we feel that that way madness lies, far more than by their immorality. Mme. de Surgis did not possess the slightest trace of any moral feeling, and would have admitted anything of her sons that could be degraded and explained by material interest, which is comprehensible to all mankind! But she forbade them to go on visiting M. de Charlus when she learned that, by a sort of internal clockwork, he was inevitably drawn upon each of their visits, to pinch their chins and to make each of them pinch his brother\u2019s. She felt that uneasy sense of a physical mystery which makes us ask ourself whether the neighbour with whom we have been on friendly terms is not tainted with cannibalism, and to the Baron\u2019s repeated inquiry: \u201cWhen am I going to see your sons again?\u201d she would reply, conscious of the thunderbolts that she was attracting to her defenceless head, that they were very busy working for examinations, preparing to go abroad, and so forth. Irresponsibility aggravates faults, and even crimes, whatever anyone may say. Landru (assuming that he really did kill his wives) if he did so from a financial motive, which it is possible to resist, may be pardoned, but not if his crime was due to an irresistible Sadism\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Brichot\u2019s coarse pleasantries, in the early days of his friendship with the Baron, had given place, as soon as it was a question, not of uttering commonplaces, but of understanding, to an awkward feeling which concealed a certain merriment. He reassured himself by recalling pages of Plato, lines of Virgil, because, being mentally as well as physically blind, he did not understand that in those days to fall in love with a young man was like, in our day (Socrates\u2019s jokes reveal this more clearly than Plato\u2019s theories), keeping a dancing girl before one marries and settles down. M. de Charlus himself would not have understood, he who confused his mania with friendship, which does not resemble it in the least, and the athletes of Praxiteles with obliging boxers. He refused to see that for the last nineteen hundred years (\u201ca pious courtier under a pious prince would have been an atheist under an atheist prince,\u201d as Labruy\u00e8re reminds us) all conventional homosexuality \u2014 that of Plato\u2019s young friends as well as that of Virgil\u2019s shepherds \u2014 has disappeared, that what survives and increases is only the involuntary, the neurotic kind, which we conceal from other people and disguise to ourselves. And M. de Charlus would have been wrong in not denying frankly the pagan genealogy. In exchange for a little plastic beauty, how vast the moral superiority! The shepherd in Theocritus who sighs for love of a boy, later on will have no reason to be less hard of heart, less dull of wit than the other shepherd whose flute sounds for Amaryllis. For the former is not suffering from a malady, he is conforming to the customs of his time. It is the homosexuality that survives in spite of obstacles, a thing of scorn and loathing, that is the only true form, the only form that can be found conjoined in a person with an enhancement of his moral qualities. We are appalled at the apparently close relation between these and our bodily attributes, when we think of the slight dislocation of a purely physical taste, the slight blemish in one of the senses, which explain why the world of poets and musicians, so firmly barred against the Duc de Guermantes, opens its portals to M. de Charlus. That the latter should shew taste in the furnishing of his home, which is that of an eclectic housewife, need not surprise us; but the narrow loophole that opens upon Beethoven and Veronese! This does not exempt the sane from a feeling of alarm when a madman who has composed a sublime poem, after explaining to them in the most logical fashion that he has been shut up by mistake, through his wife\u2019s machinations, imploring them to intercede for him with the governor of the asylum, complaining of the promiscuous company that is forced upon him, concludes as follows: \u201cYou see that man who is waiting to speak to me on the lawn, whom I am obliged to put up with; he thinks that he is Jesus Christ. That alone will shew you the sort of lunatics that I have to live among; he cannot be Christ, for I am Christ myself!\u201d A moment earlier, you were on the point of going to assure the governor that a mistake had been made. At this final speech, even if you bear in mind the admirable poem at which this same man is working every day, you shrink from him, as Mme. de Surgis\u2019s sons shrank from M. de Charlus, not that he would have done them any harm, but because of his ceaseless invitations, the ultimate purpose of which was to pinch their chins. The poet is to be pitied, who must, with no Virgil to guide him, pass through the circles of an inferno of sulphur and brimstone, to cast himself into the fire that falls from heaven, in order to rescue a few of the inhabitants of Sodom! No charm in his work; the same severity in his life as in those of the unfrocked priests who follow the strictest rule of celibacy so that no one may be able to ascribe to anything but loss of faith their discarding of the cassock\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Making a pretence of not seeing the seedy individual who was following in his wake (whenever the Baron ventured into the Boulevards or crossed the waiting-room in Saint-Lazarre station, these followers might be counted by the dozen who, in the hope of \u2018touching him for a dollar,\u2019 never let him out of their sight), and afraid at the same time that the other might have the audacity to accost him, the Baron had devoutly lowered his darkened eyelids which, in contrast to his rice-powdered cheeks, gave him the appearance of a Grand Inquisitor painted by El Greco. But this priestly expression caused alarm, and he looked like an unfrocked priest, various compromises to which he had been driven by the need to apologise for his taste and to keep it secret having had the effect of bringing to the surface of his face precisely what the Baron sought to conceal, a debauched life indicated by moral decay. This last, indeed, whatever be its cause, is easily detected, for it is never slow in taking bodily form and proliferates upon a face, especially on the cheeks and round the eyes, as physically as the ochreous yellows accumulate there in a case of jaundice or repulsive reds in a case of skin disease. Nor was it merely in the cheeks, or rather the chaps of this painted face, in the mammiferous chest, the aggressive rump of this body allowed to deteriorate and invaded by obesity, upon which there now floated iridescent as a film of oil, the vice at one time so jealously confined by M. de Charlus in the most secret chamber of his heart. Now it overflowed in all his speech\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo this is how you prowl the streets at night, Brichot, with a good-looking young man,\u201d he said as he joined us, while the disappointed ruffian made off. \u201cA fine example. We must tell your young pupils at the Sorbonne that this is how you behave. But, I must say, the society of youth seems to be good for you, Monsieur le Professeur, you are as fresh as a rosebud. I have interrupted you, you looked as though you were enjoying yourselves like a pair of giddy girls, and had no need of an old Granny Killjoy like myself. I shan\u2019t take it to the confessional, since you are almost at your destination.\u201d The Baron\u2019s mood was all the more blithe since he knew nothing whatever about the scene that afternoon, Jupien having decided that it was better to protect his niece against a repetition of the onslaught than to inform M. de Charlus. And so the Baron was still looking forward to the marriage, and delighting in the thought of it. One would suppose that it is a consolation to these great solitaries to give their tragic celibacy the relief of a fictitious fatherhood. \u201cBut, upon my word, Brichot,\u201d he went on, turning with a laugh to gaze at us, \u201cI feel quite awkward when I see you in such gallant company. You were like a pair of lovers. Going along arm in arm, I say, Brichot, you do go the pace!\u201d Ought one to ascribe this speech to the senility of a particular state of mind, less capable than in the past of controlling its reflexes, which in moments of automatism lets out a secret that has been so carefully hidden for forty years? Or rather to that contempt for plebeian opinion which all the Guermantes felt in their hearts, and of which M. de Charlus\u2019s brother, the Duke, was displaying a variant form when, regardless of the fact that my mother could see him, he used to shave standing by his bedroom window in his unbuttoned nightshirt. Had M. de Charlus contracted, during the roasting journeys between Donci\u00e8res and Douville, the dangerous habit of making himself at ease, and, just as he would push back his straw hat in order to cool his huge forehead, of unfastening \u2014 at first, for a few moments only \u2014 the mask that for too long had been rigorously imposed upon his true face? His conjugal attitude towards Morel might well have astonished anyone who had observed it in its full extent. But M. de Charlus had reached the stage when the monotony of the pleasures that his vice has to offer became wearying. He had sought instinctively for novel displays, and, growing tired of the strangers whom he picked up, had passed to the opposite pole, to what he used to imagine that he would always loathe, the imitation of family life, or of fatherhood. Sometimes even this did not suffice him, he required novelty, and would go and spend the night with a woman, just as a normal man may, once in his life, have wished to go to bed with a boy, from a curiosity similar though inverse, and in either case equally unhealthy. The Baron\u2019s existence as one of the \u2018faithful,\u2019 living, for Charlie\u2019s sake, entirely among the little clan, had had, in stultifying the efforts that he had been making for years to keep up lying appearances, the same influence that a voyage of exploration or residence in the colonies has upon certain Europeans who discard the ruling principles by which they were guided at home. And yet, the internal revolution of a mind, ignorant at first of the anomaly contained in its body, then appalled at it after the discovery, and finally growing so used to it as to fail to perceive that it is not safe to confess to other people what the sinner has come in time to confess without shame to himself, had been even more effective in liberating M. de Charlus from the last vestiges of social constraint than the time that he spent at the Verdurins\u2019. No banishment, indeed, to the South Pole, or to the summit of Mont Blanc, can separate us so entirely from our fellow creatures as a prolonged residence in the seclusion of a secret vice, that is to say of a state of mind that is different from theirs. A vice (so M. de Charlus used at one time to style it) to which the Baron now gave the genial aspect of a mere failing, extremely common, attractive on the whole and almost amusing, like laziness, absent-mindedness or greed. Conscious of the curiosity that his own striking personality aroused, M. de Charlus derived a certain pleasure from satisfying, whetting, sustaining it. Just as a Jewish journalist will come forward day after day as the champion of Catholicism, not, probably, with any hope of being taken seriously, but simply in order not to disappoint the good-natured amusement of his readers, M. de Charlus would genially denounce evil habits among the little clan, as he would have mimicked a person speaking English or imitated Mounet-Sully, without waiting to be asked, so as to pay his scot with a good grace, by displaying an amateur talent in society; so that M. de Charlus now threatened Brichot that he would report to the Sorbonne that he was in the habit of walking about with young men, exactly as the circumcised scribe keeps referring in and out of season to the \u2018Eldest Daughter of the Church\u2019 and the \u2018Sacred Heart of Jesus,\u2019 that is to say without the least trace of hypocrisy, but with a distinctly histrionic effect. It was not only the change in the words themselves, so different from those that he allowed himself to use in the past, that seemed to require some explanation, there was also the change that had occurred in his intonations, his gestures, all of which now singularly resembled the type M. de Charlus used most fiercely to castigate; he would now utter unconsciously almost the same little cries (unconscious in him, and all the more deep-rooted) as are uttered consciously by the inverts who refer to one another as \u2018she\u2019; as though this deliberate \u2018camping,\u2019 against which M. de Charlus had for so long set his face, were after all merely a brilliant and faithful imitation of the manner that men of the Charlus type, whatever they may say, are compelled to adopt when they have reached a certain stage in their malady, just as sufferers from general paralysis or locomotor ataxia inevitably end by displaying certain symptoms. As a matter of fact \u2014 and this is what this purely unconscious \u2018camping\u2019 revealed \u2014 the difference between the stern Charlus, dressed all in black, with his stiffly brushed hair, whom I had known, and the painted young men, loaded with rings, was no more than the purely imaginary difference that exists between an excited person who talks fast, keeps moving all the time, and a neurotic who talks slowly, preserves a perpetual phlegm, but is tainted with the same neurasthenia in the eyes of the physician who knows that each of the two is devoured by the same anguish and marred by the same defects. At the same time one could tell that M. de Charlus had aged from wholly different signs, such as the extraordinary frequency in his conversation of certain expressions that had taken root in it and used now to crop up at every moment (for instance: \u2018the chain of circumstances\u2019) upon which the Baron\u2019s speech leaned in sentence after sentence as upon a necessary prop. \u201cIs Charlie here yet?\u201d Brichot asked M. de Charlus as we came in sight of the door. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said the Baron, raising his arms and half-shutting his eyes with the air of a person who does not wish anyone to accuse him of being indiscreet, all the more so as he had probably been reproached by Morel for things which he had said and which the other, as timorous as he was vain, and as ready to deny M. de Charlus as he was to boast of his friendship, had considered serious albeit they were quite unimportant. \u201cYou know, he never tells me what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d If the conversations of two people bound by a tie of intimacy are full of falsehood, this occurs no less spontaneously in the conversations that a third person holds with a lover on the subject of the person with whom the latter is in love, whatever be the sex of that person\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you seen him lately?\u201d I asked M. de Charlus, with the object of seeming at once not to be afraid of mentioning Morel to him and not to believe that they were actually living together. \u201cHe came in, as it happened, for five minutes this morning while I was still half asleep, and sat down on the side of my bed, as though he wanted to ravish me.\u201d I guessed at once that M. de Charlus had seen Charlie within the last hour, for if we ask a woman when she last saw the man whom we know to be \u2014 and whom she may perhaps suppose that we suspect of being \u2014 her lover, if she has just taken tea with him, she replies: \u201cI saw him for an instant before luncheon.\u201d Between these two incidents the only difference is that one is false and the other true, but both are equally innocent, or, if you prefer it, equally culpable. And so we should be unable to understand why the mistress (in this case, M. de Charlus) always chooses the false version, did we not know that such replies are determined, unknown to the person who utters them, by a number of factors which appear so out of proportion to the triviality of the incident that we do not take the trouble to consider them. But to a physicist the space occupied by the tiniest ball of pith is explained by the harmony of action, the conflict or equilibrium, of laws of attraction or repulsion which govern far greater worlds. Just as many different laws acting in opposite directions dictate the more general responses with regard to the innocence, the \u2018platonism,\u2019 or on the contrary the carnal reality of the relations that one has with the person whom one says one saw in the morning when one has seen him or her in the evening. Here we need merely record, without pausing to consider them, the desire to appear natural and fearless, the instinctive impulse to conceal a secret assignation, a blend of modesty and ostentation, the need to confess what one finds so delightful and to shew that one is loved, a divination of what the other person knows or guesses \u2014 but does not say \u2014 a divination which, exceeding or falling short of the other person\u2019s, makes one now exaggerate, now under-estimate it, the spontaneous longing to play with fire and the determination to rescue something from the blaze. At the same time, speaking generally, let us say that M. de Charlus, notwithstanding the aggravation of his malady which perpetually urged him to reveal, to insinuate, sometimes boldly to invent compromising details, did intend, during this period in his life, to make it known that Charlie was not a man of the same sort as himself and that they were friends and nothing more. This did not prevent him (even though it may quite possibly have been true) from contradicting himself at times (as with regard to the hour at which they had last met), whether he forgot himself at such moments and told the truth, or invented a lie, boastingly or from a sentimental affectation or because he thought it amusing to baffle his questioner. \u201cYou know that he is to me,\u201d the Baron went on, \u201cthe best of comrades, for whom I have the greatest affection, as I am certain\u201d (was he uncertain of it, then, that he felt the need to say that he was certain?) \u201che has for me, but there is nothing at all between us, nothing of that sort, you understand, nothing of that sort,\u201d said the Baron, as naturally as though he had been speaking of a woman. \u201cYes, he came in this morning to pull me out of bed. Though he knows that I hate anybody to see me in bed. You don\u2019t mind? Oh, it\u2019s horrible, it\u2019s so disturbing, one looks so perfectly hideous, of course I\u2019m no longer five-and-twenty, they won\u2019t choose me to be Queen of the May, still one does like to feel that one is looking one\u2019s best.\u201d\nYou might also like\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is possible that the Baron was in earnest when he spoke of Morel as a good comrade, and that he was being even more truthful than he supposed when he said: \u201cI never know what he\u2019s doing; he tells me nothing about his life.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed we may mention (interrupting for a few moments our narrative, which shall be resumed immediately after the closure of this parenthesis which opens at the moment when M. de Charlus, Brichot and myself are arriving at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s front door), we may mention that shortly before this evening the Baron had been plunged in grief and stupefaction by a letter which he had opened by mistake and which was addressed to Morel. This letter, which by a repercussion was to cause intense misery to myself also, was written by the actress L\u00e9a, notorious for her exclusive interest in women. And yet her letter to Morel (whom M. de Charlus had never suspected of knowing her, even) was written in the most impassioned tone. Its indelicacy prevents us from reproducing it here, but we may mention that L\u00e9a addressed him throughout in the feminine gender, with such expressions as: \u201cGo on, you bad woman!\u201d or \u201cOf course you are so, my pretty, you know you are.\u201d And in this letter reference was made to various other women who seemed to be no less Morel\u2019s friends than L\u00e9a\u2019s. On the other hand, Morel\u2019s sarcasm at the Baron\u2019s expense and L\u00e9a\u2019s at that of an officer who was keeping her, and of whom she said: \u201cHe keeps writing me letters begging me to be careful! What do you say to that, my little white puss,\u201d revealed to M. de Charlus a state of things no less unsuspected by him than were Morel\u2019s peculiar and intimate relations with L\u00e9a. What most disturbed the Baron was the word \u2018so.\u2019 Ignorant at first of its application, he had eventually, at a time already remote in the past, learned that he himself was \u2018so.\u2019 And now the notion that he had acquired of this word was again put to the challenge. When he had discovered that he was \u2018so,\u2019 he had supposed this to mean that his tastes, as Saint-Simon says, did not lie in the direction of women. And here was this word \u2018so\u2019 applied to Morel with an extension of meaning of which M. de Charlus was unaware, so much so that Morel gave proof, according to this letter, of his being \u2018so\u2019 by having the same taste as certain women for other women. From that moment the Baron\u2019s jealousy had no longer any reason to confine itself to the men of Morel\u2019s acquaintance, but began to extend to the women also. So that the people who were \u2018so\u2019 were not merely those that he had supposed to be \u2018so,\u2019 but a whole and vast section of the inhabitants of the planet, consisting of women as well as of men, loving not merely men but women also, and the Baron, in the face of this novel meaning of a word that was so familiar to him, felt himself tormented by an anxiety of the mind as well as of the heart, born of this twofold mystery which combined an extension of the field of his jealousy with the sudden inadequacy of a definition\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus had never in his life been anything but an amateur. That is to say, incidents of this sort could never be of any use to him. He worked off the painful impression that they might make upon him in violent scenes in which he was a past-master of eloquence, or in crafty intrigues. But to a person endowed with the qualities of a Bergotte, for instance, they might have been of inestimable value. This may indeed explain, to a certain extent (since we have to grope blindfold, but choose, like the lower animals, the herb that is good for us), why men like Bergotte have generally lived in the company of persons who were ordinary, false and malicious. Their beauty is sufficient for the writer\u2019s imagination, enhances his generosity, but does not in any way alter the nature of his companion, whose life, situated thousands of feet below the level of his own, her incredible stories, her lies carried farther, and, what is more, in another direction than what might have been expected, appear in occasional flashes. The lie, the perfect lie, about people whom we know, about the relations that we have had with them, about our motive for some action, a motive which we express in totally different terms, the lie as to what we are, whom we love, what we feel with regard to the person who loves us and believes that she has fashioned us in her own image because she keeps on kissing us morning, noon and night, that lie is one of the only things in the world that can open a window for us upon what is novel, unknown, that can awaken in us sleeping senses to the contemplation of universes that otherwise we should never have known. We are bound to say, in so far as M. de Charlus is concerned, that, if he was stupefied to learn with regard to Morel a certain number of things which the latter had carefully concealed from him, he was not justified in concluding from this that it was a mistake to associate too closely with the lower orders. We shall indeed see, in the concluding section of this work, M. de Charlus himself engaged in doing things which would have stupefied the members of his family and his friends far more than he could possibly have been stupefied by the revelations of L\u00e9a. (The revelation that he had found most painful had been that of a tour which Morel had made with L\u00e9a, whereas at the time he had assured M. de Charlus that he was studying music in Germany. He had found support for this falsehood in obliging friends in Germany to whom he had sent his letters, to be forwarded from there to M. de Charlus, who, as it happened, was so positive that Morel was there that he had not even looked at the postmark.) But it is time to rejoin the Baron as he advances with Brichot and myself towards the Verdurins\u2019 door\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd what,\u201d he went on, turning to myself, \u201chas become of your young Hebrew friend, whom we met at Douville? It occurred to me that, if you liked, one might perhaps invite him to the house one evening.\u201d For M. de Charlus, who did not shrink from employing a private detective to spy upon every word and action of Morel, for all the world like a husband or a lover, had not ceased to pay attention to other young men. The vigilance which he made one of his old servants maintain, through an agency, upon Morel, was so indiscreet that his footmen thought they were being watched, and one of the housemaids could not endure the suspense, never ventured into the street, always expecting to find a policeman at her heels. \u201cShe can do whatever she likes! It would be a waste of time and money to follow her! As if her goings on mattered to us!\u201d the old servant ironically exclaimed, for he was so passionately devoted to his master that, albeit he in no way shared the Baron\u2019s tastes, he had come in time, with such ardour did he employ himself in their service, to speak of them as though they were his own. \u201cHe is the very best of good fellows,\u201d M. de Charlus would say of this old servant, for we never appreciate anyone so much as those who combine with other great virtues that of placing themselves unconditionally at the disposal of our vices. It was moreover of men alone that M. de Charlus was capable of feeling any jealousy so far as Morel was concerned. Women inspired in him no jealousy whatever. This is indeed an almost universal rule with the Charlus type. The love of the man with whom they are in love for women is something different, which occurs in another animal species (a lion does not interfere with tigers); does not distress them; if anything, reassures them. Sometimes, it is true, in the case of those who exalt their inversion to the level of a priesthood, this love creates disgust. These men resent their friends\u2019 having succumbed to it, not as a betrayal but as a lapse from virtue. A Charlus, of a different variety from the Baron, would have been as indignant at the discovery of Morel\u2019s relations with a woman as upon reading in a newspaper that he, the interpreter of Bach and Handel, was going to play Puccini. It is, by the way, for this reason that the young men who, with an eye to their own personal advantage, condescend to the love of men like Charlus, assure them that women inspire them only with disgust, just as they would tell a doctor that they never touch alcohol, and care only for spring water. But M. de Charlus, in this respect, departed to some extent from the general rule. Since he admired everything about Morel, the latter\u2019s successes with women caused him no annoyance, gave him the same joy as his successes on the platform, or at \u00e9cart\u00e9. \u201cBut do you know, my dear fellow, he has women,\u201d he would say, with an air of disclosure, of scandal, possibly of envy, above all of admiration. \u201cHe is extraordinary,\u201d he would continue. \u201cEverywhere, the most famous whores can look at nobody but him. They stare at him everywhere, whether, it\u2019s on the underground or in the theatre. It\u2019s becoming a nuisance! I can\u2019t go out with him to a restaurant without the waiter bringing him notes from at least three women. And always pretty women too. Not that there\u2019s anything surprising in that. I was watching him yesterday, I can quite understand it, he has become so beautiful, he looks just like a Bronzino, he is really marvellous.\u201d But M. de Charlus liked to shew that he was in love with Morel, to persuade other people, possibly to persuade himself, that Morel was in love with him. He applied to the purpose of having Morel always with him (notwithstanding the harm that the young fellow might do to the Baron\u2019s social position) a sort of self-esteem. For (and this is frequent among men of good position, who are snobs, and, in their vanity, sever all their social ties in order to be seen everywhere with a mistress, a person of doubtful or a lady of tarnished reputation, whom nobody will invite, and with whom nevertheless it seems to them flattering to be associated) he had arrived at that stage at which self-esteem devotes all its energy to destroying the goals to which it has attained, whether because, under the influence of love, a man finds a prestige which he is alone in perceiving in ostentatious relations with the beloved object, or because, by the waning of social ambitions that have been gratified, and the rising of a tide of subsidiary curiosities all the more absorbing the more platonic they are, the latter have not only reached but have passed the level at which the former found it difficult to remain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for young men in general, M. de Charlus found that to his fondness for them Morel\u2019s existence was not an obstacle, and that indeed his brilliant reputation as a violinist or his growing fame as a composer and journalist might in certain instances prove an attraction. Did anyone introduce to the Baron a young composer of an agreeable type, it was in Morel\u2019s talents that he sought an opportunity of doing the stranger a favour. \u201cYou must,\u201d he would tell him, \u201cbring me some of your work so that Morel can play it at a concert or on tour. There is hardly any decent music written, now, for the violin. It is a godsend to find anything new. And abroad they appreciate that sort of thing enormously. Even in the provinces there are little musical societies where they love music with a fervour and intelligence that are quite admirable.\u201d Without any greater sincerity (for all this could serve only as a bait and it was seldom that Morel condescended to fulfil these promises), Bloch having confessed that he was something of a poet (when he was \u2018in the mood,\u2019 he had added with the sarcastic laugh with which he would accompany a platitude, when he could think of nothing original), M. de Charlus said to me: \u201cYou must tell your young Israelite, since he writes verses, that he must really bring me some for Morel. For a composer, that is always the stumbling block, to find something decent to set to music. One might even consider a libretto. It would not be without interest, and would acquire a certain value from the distinction of the poet, from my patronage, from a whole chain of auxiliary circumstances, among which Morel\u2019s talent would take the chief place, for he is composing a lot just now, and writing too, and very pleasantly, I must talk to you about it. As for his talent as a performer (there, as you know, he is already a past-master), you shall see this evening how well the lad plays Vinteuil\u2019s music; he overwhelms me; at his age, to have such an understanding while he is still such a boy, such a kid! Oh, this evening is only to be a little rehearsal. The big affair is to come off in two or three days. But it will be much more distinguished this evening. And so we are delighted that you have come,\u201d he went on, employing the plural pronoun doubtless because a King says: \u201cIt is our wish.\u201d \u201cThe programme is so magnificent that I have advised Mme. Verdurin to give two parties. One in a few days\u2019 time, at which she will have all her own friends, the other to-night at which the hostess is, to use a legal expression, \u2018disseized.\u2019 It is I who have issued the invitations, and I have collected a few people from another sphere, who may be useful to Charlie, and whom it will be nice for the Verdurins to meet. Don\u2019t you agree, it is all very well to have the finest music played by the greatest artists, the effect of the performance remains muffled in cotton-wool, if the audience is composed of the milliner from across the way and the grocer from round the corner. You know what I think of the intellectual level of people in society, still they can play certain quite important parts, among others that which in public events devolves upon the press, and which is that of being an organ of publicity. You know what I mean; I have for instance invited my sister-in-law Oriane; it is not certain that she will come, but it is on the other hand certain that, if she does come, she will understand absolutely nothing. But one does not ask her to understand, which is beyond her capacity, but to talk, a task which is admirably suited to her, and which she never fails to perform. What is the result? To-morrow as ever is, instead of the silence of the milliner and the grocer, an animated conversation at the Mortemarts\u2019 with Oriane telling everyone that she has heard the most marvellous music, that a certain Morel, and so forth; unspeakable rage of the people not invited, who will say: \u2018Palam\u00e8de thought, no doubt, that we were unworthy; anyhow, who are these people who were giving the party?\u2019 a counterblast quite as useful as Oriane\u2019s praises, because Morel\u2019s name keeps cropping up all the time and is finally engraved in the memory like a lesson that one has read over a dozen times. All this forms a chain of circumstances which may be of value to the artist, to the hostess, may serve as a sort of megaphone for a performance which will thus be made audible to a remote public. Really, it is worth the trouble; you shall see what progress Charlie has made. And what is more, we have discovered a new talent in him, my dear fellow, he writes like an angel. Like an angel, I tell you.\u201d M. de Charlus omitted to say that for some time past he had been employing Morel, like those great noblemen of the seventeenth century who scorned to sign and even to write their own slanderous attacks, to compose certain vilely calumnious little paragraphs at the expense of Comtesse Mole. Their insolence apparent even to those who merely glanced at them, how much more cruel were they to the young woman herself, who found in them, so skilfully introduced that nobody but herself saw the point, certain passages from her own correspondence, textually quoted, but interpreted in a sense which made them as deadly as the cruellest revenge. They killed the lady. But there is edited every day in Paris, Balzac would tell us, a sort of spoken newspaper, more terrible than its printed rivals. We shall see later on that this verbal press reduced to nothing the power of a Charlus who had fallen out of fashion, and exalted far above him a Morel who was not worth the millionth part of his former patron. Is this intellectual fashion really so simple, and does it sincerely believe in the nullity of a Charlus of genius, in the incontestable authority of a crass Morel? The Baron was not so innocent in his implacable vengeance. Whence, no doubt, that bitter venom on his tongue, the spreading of which seemed to dye his cheeks with jaundice when he was in a rage. \u201cYou who knew Bergotte,\u201d M. de Charlus went on, \u201cI thought at one time that you might, perhaps, by refreshing his memory with regard to the youngster\u2019s writings, collaborate in short with myself, help me to assist a twofold talent, that of a musician and a writer, which may one day acquire the prestige of that of Berlioz. As you know, the Illustrious have often other things to think about, they are smothered in flattery, they take little interest except in themselves. But Bergotte, who was genuinely unpretentious and obliging, promised me that he would get into the Gaulois, or some such paper, those little articles, a blend of the humourist and the musician, which he really does quite charmingly now, and I am really very glad that Charlie should combine with his violin this little stroke of Ingres\u2019s pen. I know that I am prone to exaggeration, when he is concerned, like all the old fairy godmothers of the Conservatoire. What, my dear fellow, didn\u2019t you know that? You have never observed my little weakness. I pace up and down for hours on end outside the examination hall. I\u2019m as happy as a queen. As for Charlie\u2019s prose, Bergotte assured me that it was really very good indeed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus, who had long been acquainted with Bergotte through Swann, had indeed gone to see him a few days before his death, to ask him to find an opening for Morel in some newspaper for a sort of commentary, half humorous, upon the music of the day. In doing so, M. de Charlus had felt some remorse, for, himself a great admirer of Bergotte, he was conscious that he never went to see him for his own sake, but in order, thanks to the respect, partly intellectual, partly social, that Bergotte felt for him, to be able to do a great service to Morel, or to some other of his friends. That he no longer made use of people in society for any other purpose did not shock M. de Charlus, but to treat Bergotte thus had appeared to him more offensive, for he felt that Bergotte had not the calculating nature of people in society, and deserved better treatment. Only, his was a busy life, and he could never find time for anything except when he was greatly interested in something, when, for instance, it affected Morel. What was more, as he was himself extremely intelligent, the conversation of an intelligent man left him comparatively cold, especially that of Bergotte who was too much the man of letters for his liking and belonged to another clan, did not share his point of view. As for Bergotte, he had observed the calculated motive of M. de Charlus\u2019s visits, but had felt no resentment, for he had been incapable, throughout his life, of any consecutive generosity, but anxious to give pleasure, broadminded, insensitive to the pleasure of administering a rebuke. As for M. de Charlus\u2019s vice, he had never partaken of it to the smallest extent, but had found in it rather an element of colour in the person affected, fas et nefas, for an artist, consisting not in moral examples but in memories of Plato or of Sodom. \u201cBut you, fair youth, we never see you at Quai Conti. You don\u2019t abuse their hospitality!\u201d I explained that I went out as a rule with my cousin. \u201cDo you hear that! He goes out with his cousin! What a most particularly pure young man!\u201d said M. de Charlus to Brichot. Then, turning again to myself: \u201cBut we are not asking you to give an account of your life, my boy. You are free to do anything that amuses you. We merely regret that we have no share in it. Besides, you shew very good taste, your cousin is charming, ask Brichot, she quite turned his head at Douville. We shall regret her absence this evening. But you did just as well, perhaps, not to bring her with you. Vinteuil\u2019s music is delightful. But I have heard that we are to meet the composer\u2019s daughter and her friend, who have a terrible reputation. That sort of thing is always awkward for a girl. They are sure to be there, unless the ladies have been detained in the country, for they were to have been present without fail all afternoon at a rehearsal which Mme. Verdurin was giving to-day, to which she had invited only the bores, her family, the people whom she could not very well have this evening. But a moment ago, before dinner, Charlie told us that the sisters Vinteuil. as we call them, for whom they were all waiting, never came.\u201d Notwithstanding the intense pain that I had felt at the sudden association with its effect, of which alone I had been aware, of the cause, at length discovered, of Albertine\u2019s anxiety to be there that afternoon, the presence publicly announced (but of which I had been ignorant) of Mlle. Vinteuil and her friend, my mind was still sufficiently detached to remark that M. de Charlus, who had told us, a few minutes earlier, that he had not seen Charlie since the morning, was now brazenly admitting that he had seen him before dinner. My pain became visible. \u201cWhy, what is the matter with you?\u201d said the Baron. \u201cYou are quite green; come, let us go in, you will catch cold, you don\u2019t look at all well.\u201d It was not any doubt as to Albertine\u2019s virtue that M. de Charlus\u2019s words had awakened in me. Many other doubts had penetrated my mind already; at each fresh doubt we feel that the measure is heaped full, that we cannot cope with it, then we manage to find room for it all the same, and once it is introduced into our vital essence it enters into competition there with so many longings to believe, so many reasons to forget, that we speedily become accustomed to it, and end by ceasing to pay it any attention. There remains only, like a partly healed pain, the menace of possible suffering, which, the counterpart of desire, a feeling of the same order, and like it become the centre of our thoughts, radiates through them to an infinite circumference a wistful melancholy, as desire radiates pleasures whose origin we fail to perceive, wherever anything may suggest the idea of the person with whom we are in love. But pain revives as soon as a fresh doubt enters our mind complete; even if we assure ourself almost immediately: \u201cI shall deal with this, there must be some method by which I need not suffer, it cannot be true,\u201d nevertheless there has been a first moment in which we suffered as though we believed it. If we had merely members, such as legs and arms, life would be endurable; unfortunately we carry inside us that little organ which we call the heart, which is subject to certain maladies in the course of which it is infinitely impressionable by everything that concerns the life of a certain person, so that a lie \u2014 that most harmless of things, in the midst of which we live so unconcernedly, if the lie be told by ourselves or by strangers \u2014 coming from that person, causes the little heart, which surgeons ought really to be able to excise from us, intolerable anguish. Let us not speak of the brain, for our mind may go on reasoning interminably in the course of this ansuish, it does no more to mitigate it than by taking thought can we soothe an aching tooth. It is true that this person is to blame for having lied to us, for she had sworn to us that she would always tell us the truth. But we know from our own shortcomings, towards other people, how little an oath is worth. And we have deliberately believed them when they came from her, the very person to whose interest it has always been to lie to us, and whom, moreover, we did not select for her virtues. It is true that, later on, she would almost cease to have any need to lie to us \u2014 at the moment when our heart will have grown indifferent to her falsehood \u2014 because then we shall not feel any interest in her life. We know this, and, notwithstanding, we deliberately sacrifice our own lives, either by killing ourselves for her sake, or by letting ourselves be sentenced to death for having murdered her, or simply by spending, in the course of a few evenings, our whole fortune upon her, which will oblige us presently to commit suicide because we have not a penny in the world. Besides, however calm we may imagine ourselves when we are in love, we always have love in our heart in a state of unstable equilibrium. A trifle is sufficient to exalt it to the position of happiness, we radiate happiness, we smother in our affection not her whom we love, but those who have given us merit in her eyes, who have protected her from every evil temptation; we think that our mind is at ease, and a word is sufficient: \u2018Gilberte is not coming,\u2019 \u2018Mademoiselle Vinteuil is expected,\u2019 to make all the preconceived happiness towards which we were rising collapse, to make the sun hide his face, to open the bag of the winds and let loose the internal tempest which one day we shall be incapable of resisting. That day, the day upon which the heart has become so frail, our friends who respect us are pained that such trifles, that certain persons, can so affect us, can bring us to death\u2019s door. But what are they to do? If a poet is dying of septic pneumonia, can one imagine his friends explaining to the pneumococcus that the poet is a man of talent and that it ought to let him recover? My doubt, in so far as it referred to Mlle. Vinteuil, was not entirely novel. But to a certain extent, my jealousy of the afternoon, inspired by L\u00e9a and her friends, had abolished it. Once that peril of the Trocad\u00e9ro was removed, I had felt that I had recaptured for all time complete peace of mind. But what was entirely novel to me was a certain excursion as to which Andr\u00e9e had told me: \u201cWe went to this place and that, we didn\u2019t meet anyone,\u201d and during which, on the contrary, Mlle. Vinteuil had evidently arranged to meet Albertine at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s. At this moment I would gladly have allowed Albertine to go out by herself, to go wherever she might choose, provided that I might lock up Mlle. Vinteuil and her friend somewhere and be certain that Albertine would not meet them. The fact is that jealousy is, as a rule, partial, of intermittent application, whether because it is the painful extension of an anxiety which is provoked now by one person, now by another with whom our mistress may be in love, or because of the exiguity of our thought which is able to realise only what it can represent to itself and leaves everything else in an obscurity which can cause us only a proportionately modified anguish\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as we were about to ring the bell we were overtaken by Saniette who informed us that Princess Sherbatoff had died at six o\u2019clock, and added that he had not at first recognised us. \u201cI envisaged you, however, for some time,\u201d he told us in a breathless voice. \u201cIs it aught but curious that I should have hesitated?\u201d To say \u201cIs it not curious\u201d would have seemed to him wrong, and he had acquired a familiarity with obsolete forms of speech that was becoming exasperating. \u201cNot but what you are people whom one may acknowledge as friends.\u201d His grey complexion seemed to be illuminated by the livid glow of a storm. His breathlessness, which had been noticeable, as recently as last summer, only when M. Verdurin \u2018jumped down his throat,\u2019 was now continuous. \u201cI understand that an unknown work of Vinteuil is to be performed by excellent artists, and singularly by Morel.\u201d \u201cWhy singularly?\u201d inquired the Baron who detected a criticism in the adverb. \u201cOur friend Saniette,\u201d Brichot made haste to exclaim, acting as interpreter, \u201cis prone to speak, like the excellent scholar that he is, the language of an age in which \u2018singularly\u2019 was equivalent to our \u2018especially.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we entered the Verdurins\u2019 hall, M. de Charlus asked me whether I was engaged upon any work and as I told him that I was not, but that I was greatly interested at the moment in old dinner-services of plate and porcelain, he assured me that I could not see any finer than those that the Verdurins had; that moreover I might have seen them at la Raspeli\u00e8re, since, on the pretext that one\u2019s possessions are also one\u2019s friends, they were so silly as to cart everything down there with them; it would be less convenient to bring everything out for my benefit on the evening of a party; still, he would tell them to shew me anything that I wished to see. I begged him not to do anything of the sort. M. de Charlus unbuttoned his greatcoat, took off his hat, and I saw that the top of his head had now turned silver in patches. But like a precious shrub which is not only coloured with autumn tints but certain leaves of which are protected by bandages of wadding or incrustations of plaster, M. de Charlus received from these few white hairs at his crest only a further variegation added to those of his face. And yet, even beneath the layers of different expressions, paint and hypocrisy which formed such a bad \u2018make-up,\u2019 his face continued to hide from almost everyone the secret that it seemed to me to be crying aloud. I was almost put to shame by his eyes in which I was afraid of his surprising me in the act of reading it, as from an open book, by his voice which seemed to me to be repeating it in every tone, with an untiring indecency. But secrets are well kept by such people, for everyone who comes in contact with them is deaf and blind. The people who learned the truth from some one else, from the Verdurins for instance, believed it, but only for so long as they had not met M. de Charlus. His face, so far from spreading, dissipated every scandalous rumour. For we form so extravagant an idea of certain characters that we would be incapable of identifying one of them with the familiar features of a person of our acquaintance. And we find it difficult to believe in such a person\u2019s vices, just as we can never believe in the genius of a person with whom we went to the Opera last night\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus was engaged in handing over his greatcoat with the instructions of a familiar guest. But the footman to whom he was handing it was a newcomer, and quite young. Now M. de Charlus had by this time begun, as people say, to \u2018lose his bearings\u2019 and did not always remember what might and what might not be done. The praiseworthy desire that he had felt at Balbec to shew that certain topics did not alarm him, that he was not afraid to declare with regard to some one or other: \u201cHe is a nice-looking boy,\u201d to utter, in short, the same words as might have been uttered by somebody who was not like himself, this desire he had now begun to express by saying on the contrary things which nobody could ever have said who was not like him, things upon which his mind was so constantly fixed that he forgot that they do not form part of the habitual preoccupation of people in general. And so, as he gazed at the new footman, he raised his forefinger in the air in a menacing fashion and, thinking that he was making an excellent joke: \u201cYou are not to make eyes at me like that, do you hear?\u201d said the Baron, and, turning to Brichot: \u201cHe has a quaint little face, that boy, his nose is rather fun,\u201d and, completing his joke, or yielding to a desire, he lowered his forefinger horizontally, hesitated for an instant, then, unable to control himself any longer, thrust it irresistibly forwards at the footman and touched the tip of his nose, saying \u201cPif!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a rum card,\u201d the footman said to himself, and inquired of his companions whether it was a joke or what it was. \u201cIt is just a way he has,\u201d said the butler (who regarded the Baron as slightly \u2018touched,\u2019 \u2018a bit balmy\u2019), \u201cbut he is one of Madame\u2019s friends for whom I have always had the greatest respect, he has a good heart.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAre you coming back this year to Incarville?\u201d Brichot asked me. \u201cI believe that our hostess has taken la Raspeli\u00e8re again, for all that she has had a crow to pick with her landlords. But that is nothing, it is a cloud that passes,\u201d he added in the optimistic tone of the newspapers that say: \u201cMistakes have been made, it is true, but who does not make mistakes at times?\u201d But I remembered the state of anguish in which I had left Balbec, and felt no desire to return there. I kept putting off to the morrow my plans for Albertine. \u201cWhy, of course he is coming back, we need him, he is indispensable to us,\u201d declared M. de Charlus with the authoritative and uncomprehending egoism of friendliness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this moment M. Verdurin appeared to welcome us. When we expressed our sympathy over Princess Sherbatoff, he said: \u201cYes, I believe she is rather ill.\u201d \u201cNo, no, she died at six o\u2019clock,\u201d exclaimed Saniette. \u201cOh, you exaggerate everything,\u201d was M. Verdurin\u2019s brutal retort, for, since he had not cancelled his party, he preferred the hypothesis of illness, imitating unconsciously the Duc de Guermantes. Saniette, not without fear of catching cold, for the outer door was continually being opened, stood waiting resignedly for some one to take his hat and coat. \u201cWhat are you hanging about there for, like a whipped dog?\u201d M. Verdurin asked him. \u201cI am waiting until one of the persons who are charged with the cloakroom can take my coat and give me a number.\u201d \u201cWhat is that you say?\u201d demanded M. Verdurin with a stern expression. \u201c\u2018Charged with the cloakroom?\u2019 Are you going off your head? \u2018In charge of the cloakroom,\u2019 is what we say, if we\u2019ve got to teach you to speak your own language, like a man who has had a stroke.\u201d \u201cCharged with a thing is the correct form,\u201d murmured Saniette in a stifled tone; \u201cthe abb\u00e9 Le Batteux. . . . \u201d \u201cYou make me tired, you do,\u201d cried M. Verdurin in a voice of thunder. \u201cHow you do wheezel Have you been running upstairs to an attic?\u201d The effect of M. Verdurin\u2019s rudeness was that the servants in the cloakroom allowed other guests to take precedence of Saniette and, when he tried to hand over his things, replied: \u201cWait for your turn, Sir, don\u2019t be in such a hurry.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s system for you, competent fellows, that\u2019s right, my lads,\u201d said M. Verdurin with an approving smile, in order to encourage them in their tendency to keep Saniette waiting till the end. \u201cCome along,\u201d he said to us, \u201cthe creature wants us all to catch our death hanging about in his beloved draught. Come and get warm in the drawing-room. \u2018Charged with the cloakroom,\u2019 indeed, what an idiot!\u201d \u201cHe is inclined to be a little precious, but he\u2019s not a bad fellow,\u201d said Brichot. \u201cI never said that he was a bad fellow, I said that he was an idiot,\u201d was M. Verdurin\u2019s harsh retort\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile Mme. Verdurin was busily engaged with Cottard and Ski. Morel had just declined (because M. de Charlus could not be present) an invitation from some friends of hers to whom she had promised the services of the violinist. The reason for Morel\u2019s refusal to perform at the party which the Verdurins\u2019 friends were giving, a reason which we shall presently see reinforced by others of a far more serious kind, might have found its justification in a habit common to the leisured classes in general but specially distinctive of the little nucleus. To be sure, if Mme. Verdurin intercepted between a newcomer and one of the faithful a whispered speech which might let it be supposed that they were already acquainted, or wished to become more intimate (\u201cOn Friday, then, at So-and-So\u2019s,\u201d or \u201cCome to the studio any day you like; I am always there until five o\u2019clock, I shall look forward to seeing you\u201d), agitated, supposing the newcomer to occupy a \u2018position\u2019 which would make him a brilliant recruit to the little clan, the Mistress, while pretending not to have heard anything, and preserving in her fine eyes, shadowed by the habit of listening to Debussy more than they would have been by that of sniffing cocaine, the extenuated expression that they derived from musical intoxication alone, revolved nevertheless behind her splendid brow, inflated by all those quartets and the headaches that were their consequence, thoughts which were not exclusively polyphonic, and unable to contain herself any longer, unable to postpone the injection for another instant, flung herself upon the speakers, drew them apart, and said to the newcomer, pointing to the \u2018faithful\u2019 one: \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t care to come and dine to meet him, next Saturday, shall we say, or any day you like, with some really nice people! Don\u2019t speak too loud, as I don\u2019t want to invite all this mob\u201d (a word used to denote for five minutes the little nucleus, disdained for the moment in favour of the newcomer in whom so many hqpes were placed)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this infatuated impulse, this need to make friendly overtures, had its counterpart. Assiduous attendance at their Wednesdays aroused in the Verdurins an opposite tendency. This was the desire to quarrel, to hold aloof. It had been strengthened, had almost been wrought to a frenzy during the months spent at la Raspeli\u00e8re, where they were all together morning, noon and night. M. Verdurin went out of his way to prove one of his guests in the wrong, to spin webs in which he might hand over to his comrade spider some innocent fly. Failing a grievance, he would invent some absurdity. As soon as one of the faithful had been out of the house for half an hour, they would make fun of him in front of the others, would feign surprise that their guests had not noticed how his teeth were never clean, or how on the contrary he had a mania for brushing them twenty times a day. If any one took the liberty of opening a window, this want of breeding would cause a glance of disgust to pass between host and hostess. A moment later Mme. Verdurin would ask for a shawl, which gave M. Verdurin an excuse for saying in a tone of fury: \u201cNo, I shall close the window, I wonder who had the impertinence to open it,\u201d in the hearing of the guilty wretch who blushed to the roots of his hair. You were rebuked indirectly for the quantity of wine that you had drunk. \u201cIt won\u2019t do you any harm. Navvies thrive on it!\u201d If two of the faithful went out together without first obtaining permission from the Mistress, their excursions led to endless comments, however innocent they might be. Those of M. de Charlus with Morel were not innocent. It was only the fact that M. de Charlus was not staying at la Raspeli\u00e8re (because Morel was obliged to live near his barracks) that retarded the hour of satiety, disgust, retching. That hour was, however, about to strike\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin was furious and determined to \u2018enlighten\u2019 Morel as to the ridiculous and detestable part that M. de Charlus was making him play. \u201cI must add,\u201d she went on (Mme. Verdurin, when she felt that she owed anyone a debt of gratitude which would be a burden to him, and was unable to rid herself of it by killing him, would discover a serious defect in him which would honourably dispense her from shewing her gratitude), \u201cI must add that he gives himself airs in my house which I do not at all like.\u201d The truth was that Mme. Verdurin had another more serious reason than Morel\u2019s refusal to play at her friends\u2019 party for picking a quarrel with M. de Charlus. The latter, overcome by the honour he was doing the Mistress in bringing to Quai Conti people who after all would never have come there for her sake, had, on hearing the first names that Mme. Verdurin had suggested as those of people who ought to be invited, pronounced the most categorical ban upon them in a peremptory tone which blended the rancorous pride of a crotchety nobleman with the dogmatism of the expert artist in questions of entertainment who would cancel his programme and withhold his collaboration sooner than agree to concessions which, in his opinion, would endanger the success of the whole. M. de Charlus had given his approval, hedging it round with reservations, to Saintine alone, with whom, in order not to be bothered with his wife, Mme. de Guermantes had passed, from a daily intimacy, to a complete severance of relations, but whom M. de Charlus, finding him intelligent, continued to see. True, it was among a middle-class set, with a cross-breeding of the minor nobility, where people are merely very rich and connected with an aristocracy whom the true aristocracy does not know, that Saintine, at one time the flower of the Guermantes set, had gone to seek his fortune and, he imagined, a social foothold. But Mme. Verdurin, knowing the blue-blooded pretensions of the wife\u2019s circle, and failing to take into account the husband\u2019s position (for it is what is immediately over our head that gives us the impression of altitude and not what is almost invisible to us, so far is it lost in the clouds), felt that she ought to justify an invitation of Saintine by pointing out that he knew a great many people, \u201chaving married Mlle. \u2014\u2014-.\u201d The ignorance which this assertion, the direct opposite of the truth, revealed in Mme. Verdurin caused the Baron\u2019s painted lips to part in a smile of indulgent scorn and wide comprehension. He disdained a direct answer, but as he was always ready to express in social examples theories which shewed the fertility of his mind and the arrogance of his pride, with the inherited frivolity of his occupations: \u201cSaintine ought to have come to me before marrying,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is such a thing as social as well as physiological eugenics, and I am perhaps the only specialist in existence. Saintine\u2019s case aroused no discussion, it was clear that, in making the marriage that he made, he was tying a stone to his neck, and hiding his light under a bushel. His social career was at an end. I should have explained this to him, and he would have understood me, for he is quite intelligent. On the other hand, there was a person who had everything that he required to make his position exalted, predominant, world-wide, only a terrible cable bound him to the earth. I helped him, partly by pressure, partly by force, to break his bonds and now he has won, with a triumphant joy, the freedom, the omnipotence that he owes to me; it required, perhaps, a little determination on his part, but what a reward! Thus a man can himself, when he has the sense to listen to me, become the midwife of his destiny.\u201d It was only too clear that M. de Charlus had not been able to influence his own; action is a different thing from speech, even eloquent speech, and from thought, even the thoughts of genius. \u201cBut, so far as I am concerned, I live the life of a philosopher who looks on with interest at the social reactions which I have foretold, but who does not assist them. And so I have continued to visit Saintine, who has always received me with the whole-hearted deference which is my due. I have even dined with him in his new abode, where one is heavily bored, in the midst of the most sumptuous splendour, as one used to be amused in the old days when, living from hand to mouth, he used to assemble the best society in a wretched attic. Him, then, you may invite, I give you leave, but I rule out with my veto all the other names that you have mentioned. And you will thank me for it, for, if I am an expert in arranging marriages, I am no less an expert in arranging parties. I know the rising people who give tone to a gathering, make it go; and I know also the names that will bring it down to the ground, make it fall flat.\u201d These exclusions were not always founded upon the Baron\u2019s personal resentments nor upon his artistic refinements, but upon his skill as an actor. When he had perfected, at the expense of somebody or something, an entirely successful epigram, he was anxious to let it be heard by the largest possible audience, but took care not to admit to the second performance the audience of the first who could have borne witness that the novelty was not novel. He would then rearrange his drawing-room, simply because he did not alter his programme, and, when he had scored a success in conversation, would, if need be, have organised a tour, and given exhibitions in the provinces. Whatever may have been the various motives for these exclusions, they did not merely annoy Mme. Verdurin, who felt her authority as a hostess impaired, they also did her great damage socially, and for two reasons. The first was that M. de Charlus, even more susceptible than Jupien, used to quarrel, without anyone\u2019s ever knowing why, with the people who were most suited to be his friends. Naturally, one of the first punishments that he could inflict upon them was that of not allowing them to be invited to a party which he was giving at the Verdurins\u2019. Now these pariahs were often people who are in the habit of ruling the roost, as the saying is, but who in M. de Charlus\u2019s eyes had ceased to rule it from the day on which he had quarrelled with them. For his imagination, in addition to finding people in the wrong in order to quarrel with them, was no less ingenious in stripping them of all importance as soon as they ceased to be his friends. If, for instance, the guilty person came of an extremely old family, whose dukedom, however, dates only from the nineteenth century, such a family as the Montesquieu, from that moment all that counted for M. de Charlus was the precedence of the dukedom, the family becoming nothing. \u201cThey are not even Dukes,\u201d he would exclaim. \u201cIt is the title of the abb\u00e9 de Montesquieu which passed most irregularly to a collateral, less than eighty years ago. The present Duke, if Duke he can be called, is the third. You may talk to me if you like of people like the Uz\u00e8s, the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00efl\u00eee, the Luynes, who are tenth or fourteenth Dukes, or my brother who is twelfth Duc de Guermantes and seventeenth Prince of Cordova. The Montesquieu are descended from an old family, what would that prove, supposing that it were proved? They have descended so far that they have reached the fourteenth storey below stairs.\u201d Had he on the contrary quarrelled with a gentleman who possessed an ancient dukedom, who boasted the most magnificent connexions, was related to ruling princes, but to whose line this distinction had come quite suddenly without any length of pedigree, a Luynes for instance, the case was altered, pedigree alone counted. \u201cI ask you \u2014 M. Alberti, who does not emerge from the mire until Louis XIII. What can it matter to us that favouritism at court allowed them to pick up dukedoms to which they have no right?\u201d What was more, with M. de Charlus, the fall came immediately after the exaltation because of that tendency peculiar to the Guermantes to expect from conversation, from friendship, something that these are incapable of giving, as well as the symptomatic fear of becoming the objects of slander. And the fall was all the greater, the higher the exaltation had been. Now nobody had ever found such favour with the Baron as he had markedly shewn for Comtesse Mole. By what sign of indifference did she reveal, one fine day, that she had been unworthy of it? The Comtesse always maintained that she had never been able to solve the problem. The fact remains that the mere sound of her name aroused in the Baron the most violent rage, provoked the most eloquent but the most terrible philippics. Mme. Verdurin, to whom Mme. Mol\u00e9 had been very kind, and who was founding, as we shall see, great hopes upon her and had rejoiced in anticipation at the thought that the Comtesse would meet in her house all the noblest names, as the Mistress said, \u201cof France and Navarre,\u201d at once proposed to invite \u201cMadame de Mol\u00e9.\u201d \u201cOh, my God! Everyone has his own taste,\u201d M. de Charlus had replied, \u201cand if you, Madame, feel a desire to converse with Mme. Pipelet, Mme. Gibout and Mme. Joseph Prudhomme, I ask nothing better, but let it be on an evening when I am not present. I could see as soon as you opened your mouth that we do not speak the same language, since I was mentioning the names of the nobility, and you retort with the most obscure names of professional and tradespeople, dirty scandalmongering little bounders, little women who imagine themselves patronesses of the arts because they repeat, an octave lower, the manners of my Guermantes sister-in-law, like a jay that thinks it is imitating a peacock. I must add that it would be positively indecent to admit to a party which I am pleased to give at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s a person whom I have with good reason excluded from my society, a sheep devoid of birth, loyalty, intelligence, who is so idiotic as to suppose that she is capable of playing the Duchesse de Guermantes and the Princesse de Guermantes, a combination which is in itself idiotic, since the Duchesse de Guermantes and the Princesse de Guermantes are poles apart. It is as though a person should pretend to be at once Reichenberg and Sarah Bernhardt. In any case, even if it were not impossible, it would be extremely ridiculous. Even though I may, myself, smile at times at the exaggeration of one and regret the limitations of the other, that is my right. But that upstart little frog trying to blow herself out to the magnitude of two great ladies who, at all events, always reveal the incomparable distinction of blood, it is enough, as the saying is, to make a cat laugh. The Mol\u00e9! That is a name which must not be uttered in my hearing, or else I must simply withdraw,\u201d he concluded with a smile, in the tone of a doctor, who, thinking of his patient\u2019s interests in spite of that same patient\u2019s opposition, lets it be understood that he will not tolerate the collaboration of a homoeopath. On the other hand, certain persons whom M. de Charlus regarded as negligible might indeed be so for him but not for Mme. Verdurin. M. de Charlus, with his exalted birth, could afford to dispense with people in the height of fashion, the assemblage of whom would have made Mme. Verdurin\u2019s drawing-room one of the first in Paris. She, at the same time, was beginning to feel that she had already on more than one occasion missed the coach, not to mention the enormous retardation that the social error of the Dreyfus case had inflicted upon her, not without doing her a service all the same. I forget whether I have mentioned the disapproval with which the Duchesse de Guermantes had observed certain persons of her world who, subordinating everything else to the Case, excluded fashionable women from their drawing-rooms and admitted others who were not fashionable, because they were for or against the fresh trial, and had then been criticised in her turn by those same ladies, as lukewarm, unsound in her views, and guilty of placing social distinctions above the national interests; may I appeal to the reader, as to a friend with regard to whom one completely forgets, at the end of a conversation, whether one has remembered, or had an opportunity to tell him something important? Whether I have done so or not, the attitude of the Duchesse de Guermantes can easily be imagined, and indeed if we look at it in the light of subsequent history may appear, from the social point of view, perfectly correct. M. de Cambremer regarded the Dreyfus case as a foreign machination intended to destroy the Intelligence Service, to undermine discipline, to weaken the army, to divide the French people, to pave the way for invasion. Literature being, apart from a few of La Fontaine\u2019s fables, a sealed book to the Marquis, he left it to his wife to prove that the cruelly introspective writers of the day had, by creating a spirit of irreverence, arrived by a parallel course at a similar result. \u201cM. Reinach and M. Hervieu are in the plot,\u201d she would say. Nobody will accuse the Dreyfus case of having premeditated such dark designs upon society. But there it certainly has broken down the hedges. The social leaders who refuse to allow politics into society are as foreseeing as the soldiers who refuse to allow politics to permeate the army. Society is like the sexual appetite; one does not know at what forms of perversion it may not arrive, once we have allowed our choice to be dictated by aesthetic considerations. The reason that they were Nationalists gave the Faubourg Saint-Germain the habit of entertaining ladies from another class of society; the reason vanished with Nationalism, the habit remained. Mme. Verdurin, by the bond of Dreyfusism, had attracted to her house certain writers of distinction who for the moment were of no advantage to her socially, because they were Dreyfusards. But political passions are like all the rest, they do not last. Fresh generations arise which are incapable of understanding them. Even the generation that felt them changes, feels political passions which, not being modelled exactly upon their predecessors, make it rehabilitate some of the excluded, the reason for exclusion having altered. Monarchists no longer cared, at the time of the Dreyfus case, whether a man had been a Republican, that is to say a Radical, that is to say Anticlerical, provided that he was an anti-Semite and a Nationalist. Should a war ever come, patriotism would assume another form and if a writer was chauvinistic nobody would stop to think whether he had or had not been a Dreyfusard. It was thus that, at each political crisis, at each artistic revival, Mme. Verdurin had collected one by one, like a bird building its nest, the several items, useless for the moment, of what would one day be her Salon. The Dreyfus case had passed, Anatole France remained. Mme. Verdurin\u2019s strength lay in her genuine love of art, the trouble that she used to take for her faithful, the marvellous dinners that she gave for them alone, without inviting anyone from the world of fashion. Each of the faithful was treated at her table as Bergotte had been treated at Mme. Swann\u2019s. When a boon companion of this sort had turned into an illustrious man whom everybody was longing to meet, his presence at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s had none of the artificial, composite effect of a dish at an official or farewell banquet, cooked by Potel or Chabot, but was merely a delicious \u2018ordinary\u2019 which you would have found there in the same perfection on a day when there was no party at all. At Mme. Verdurin\u2019s the cast was trained to perfection, the repertory most select, all that was lacking was an audience. And now that the public taste had begun to turn from the rational and French art of a Bergotte, and to go in, above all things, for exotic forms of music, Mme. Verdurin, a sort of official representative in Paris of all foreign artists, was not long in making her appearance, by the side of the exquisite Princess Yourbeletief, an aged Fairy Godmother, grim but all-powerful, to the Russian dancers. This charming invasion, against whose seductions only the stupidest of critics protested, infected Paris, as we know, with a fever of curiosity less burning, more purely aesthetic, but quite as intense perhaps as that aroused by the Dreyfus case. There again Mme. Verdurin, but with a very different result socially, was to take her place in the front row. Just as she had been seen by the side of Mme. Zola, immediately under the bench, during the trial in the Assize Court, so when the new generation of humanity, in their enthusiasm for the Russian ballet, thronged to the Opera, crowned with the latest novelty in aigrettes, they invariably saw in a stage box Mme. Verdurin by the side of Princess Yourbeletief. And just as, after the emotions of the law courts, people used to go in the evening to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, to meet Picquart or Labori in the flesh and what was more to hear the latest news of the Case, to learn what hopes might be placed in Zurlinden, Loubet, Colonel Jouaust, the Regulations, so now, little inclined for sleep after the enthusiasm aroused by the Scheherazade or Prince Igor, they repaired to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, where under the auspices of Princess Yourbeletief and their hostess an exquisite supper brought together every night the dancers themselves, who had abstained from dinner so as to be more resilient, their director, their designers, the great composers Igor Stravinski and Richard Strauss, a permanent little nucleus, around which, as round the supper-table of M. and Mme. Helv\u00e9tius, the greatest ladies in Paris and foreign royalties were not too proud to gather. Even those people in society who professed to be endowed with taste and drew unnecessary distinctions between the various Russian ballets, regarding the setting of the Sylphides as somehow \u2018purer\u2019 than that of Scheherazade, which they were almost prepared to attribute to Negro inspiration, were enchanted to meet face to face the great revivers of theatrical taste, who in an art that is perhaps a little more artificial than that of the easel had created a revolution as profound as Impressionism itself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To revert to M. de Charlus, Mme. Verdurin would not have minded so much if he had placed on his Index only Comtesse Mol\u00e9 and Mme. Bontemps, whom she had picked out at Odette\u2019s on the strength of her love of the fine arts, and who during the Dreyfus case had come to dinner occasionally bringing her husband, whom Mme. Verdurin called \u2018lukewarm,\u2019 because he was not making any move for a fresh trial, but who, being extremely intelligent, and glad to form relations in every camp, was delighted to shew his independence by dining at the same table as Labori, to whom he listened without uttering a word that might compromise himself, but managed to slip in at the right moment a tribute to the loyalty, recognised by all parties, of Jaur\u00e8s. But the Baron had similarly proscribed several ladies of the aristocracy whose acquaintance Mme. Verdurin, on the occasion of some musical festivity or a collection for charity, had recently formed and who, whatever M. de Charlus might think of them, would have been, far more than himself, essential to the formation of a fresh nucleus at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, this time aristocratic. Mme. Verdurin had indeed been reckoning upon this party, to which M. de Charlus would be bringing her women of the same set, to mix her new friends with them, and had been relishing in anticipation the surprise that the latter would feel upon meeting at Quai Conti their own friends or relatives invited there by the Baron. She was disappointed and furious at his veto. It remained to be seen whether the evening, in these conditions, would result in profit or loss to herself. The loss would not be too serious if only M. de Charlus\u2019s guests came with so friendly a feeling for Mme. Verdurin that they would become her friends in the future. In this case the mischief would be only half done, these two sections of the fashionable world, which the Baron had insisted upon keeping apart, would be united later on, he himself being excluded, of course, when the time came. And so Mme. Verdurin was awaiting the Baron\u2019s guests with a certain emotion. She would not be slow in discovering the state of mind in which they came, and the degree of intimacy to which she might hope to attain. While she waited, Mme. Verdurin took counsel with the faithful, but, upon seeing M. de Charlus enter the room with Brichot and myself, stopped short. Greatly to our astonishment, when Brichot told her how sorry he was to learn that her dear friend was so seriously ill, Mme. Verdurin replied: \u201cListen, I am obliged to confess that I am not at all sorry. It is useless to pretend to feel what one does not feel.\u201d No doubt she spoke thus from want of energy, because she shrank from the idea of wearing a long face throughout her party, from pride, in order not to appear to be seeking excuses for not having cancelled her invitations, from self-respect also and social aptitude, because the absence of grief which she displayed was more honourable if it could be attributed to a peculiar antipathy, suddenly revealed, to the Princess, rather than to a universal insensibility, and because her hearers could not fail to be disarmed by a sincerity as to which there could be no doubt. If Mme. Verdurin had not been genuinely unaffected by the death of the Princess, would she have gone on to excuse herself for giving the party, by accusing herself of a far more serious fault? Besides, one was apt to forget that Mme. Verdurin would thus have admitted, while confessing her grief, that she had not had the strength of mind to forego a pleasure; whereas the indifference of the friend was something more shocking, more immoral, but less humiliating, and consequently easier to confess than the frivolity of the hostess. In matters of crime, where the culprit is in danger, it is his material interest that prompts the confession. Where the fault incurs no penalty, it is self-esteem. Whether it was that, doubtless feeling the pretext to be too hackneyed of the people who, so as not to allow a bereavement to interrupt their life of pleasure, go about saying that it seems to them useless to display the outward signs of a grief which they feel in their hearts, Mme. Verdurin preferred to imitate those intelligent culprits who are revolted by the commonplaces of innocence and whose defence \u2014 a partial admission, though they do not know it \u2014 consists in saying that they would see no harm in doing what they are accused of doing, although, as it happens, they have had no occasion to do it; or that, having adopted, to explain her conduct, the theory of indifference, she found, once she had started upon the downward slope of her unnatural feeling, that it was distinctly original to have felt it, that she displayed a rare perspicacity in having managed to diagnose her own symptoms, and a certain \u2018nerve\u2019 in proclaiming them; anyhow, Mme. Verdurin kept dwelling upon her want of grief, not without a certain proud satisfaction, as of a paradoxical psychologist and daring dramatist. \u201cYes, it is very funny,\u201d she said, \u201cI hardly felt it. Of course, I don\u2019t mean to say that I wouldn\u2019t rather she were still alive, she was not a bad person.\u201d \u201cYes, she was,\u201d put in M. Verdurin. \u201cAh! He doesn\u2019t approve of her because he thought that I was doing myself harm by having her here, but he is quite pig-headed about that.\u201d \u201cDo me the justice to admit,\u201d said M. Verdurin, \u201cthat I never approved of your having her. I always told you that she had a bad reputation.\u201d \u201cBut I have never heard a thing against her,\u201d protested Saniette. \u201cWhat!\u201d exclaimed Mme. Verdurin, \u201ceverybody knew; bad isn\u2019t the word, it was scandalous, appalling. No, it has nothing to do with that. I couldn\u2019t explain, myself, what I felt; I didn\u2019t dislike her, but I took so little interest in her that, when we heard that she was seriously ill, my husband himself was quite surprised, and said: \u2018Anyone would think that you didn\u2019t mind.\u2019 Why, this evening, he offered to put off the party, and I insisted upon having it, because I should have thought it a farce to shew a grief which I do not feel.\u201d She said this because she felt that it had a curious smack of the \u2018independent theatre,\u2019 and was at the same time singularly convenient; for an admitted insensibility or immorality simplifies life as much as does easy virtue; it converts reproachable actions, for which one no longer need seek any excuse, into a duty imposed by sincerity. And the faithful listened to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s speech with the blend of admiration and misgiving which certain cruelly realistic plays, that shewed a profound observation, used at one time to cause, and, while they marvelled to see their beloved Mistress display a novel aspect of her rectitude and independence, more than one of them, albeit he assured himself that after all it would not be the same thing, thought of his own death, and asked himself whether, on the day when death came to him, they would draw the blinds or give a party at Quai Conti. \u201cI am very glad that the party has not been put off, for my guests\u2019 sake,\u201d said M. de Charlus, not realising that in expressing himself thus he was offending Mme. Verdurin. Meanwhile I was struck, as was everybody who approached Mme. Verdurin that evening, by a far from pleasant odour of rhinogomenol. The reason was as follows. We know that Mme. Verdurin never expressed her artistic feelings in a moral, but always in a physical fashion, so that they might appear more inevitable and more profound. So, if one spoke to her of Vinteuil\u2019s music, her favourite, she remained unmoved, as though she expected to derive no emotion from it. But after a few minutes of a fixed, almost abstracted gaze, in a sharp, matter of fact, scarcely civil tone (as though she had said to you: \u201cI don\u2019t in the least mind your smoking, it\u2019s because of the carpet; it\u2019s a very fine one [not that that matters either], but it\u2019s highly inflammable, I\u2019m dreadfully afraid of fire, and I shouldn\u2019t like to see you all roasted because some one had carelessly dropped a cigarette end on it\u201d), she replied: \u201cI have no fault to find with Vinteuil; to my mind, he is the greatest composer of the age, only I can never listen to that sort of stuff without weeping all the time\u201d (she did not apply any pathos to the word \u2018weeping,\u2019 she would have used precisely the same tone for \u2018sleeping\u2019; certain slandermongers used indeed to insist that the latter verb would have been more applicable, though no one could ever be certain, for she listened to the music with her face buried in her hands, and certain snoring sounds might after all have been sobs). \u201cI don\u2019t mind weeping, not in the least; only I get the most appalling colds afterwards. It stuffs up my mucous membrane, and the day after I look like nothing on earth. I have to inhale for days on end before I can utter. However, one of Cottard\u2019s pupils, a charming person, has been treating me for it. He goes by quite an original rule: \u2018Prevention is better than cure.\u2019 And he greases my nose before the music begins. It is radical. I can weep like all the mothers who ever lost a child, not a trace of a cold. Sometimes a little conjunctivitis, that\u2019s all. It is absolutely efficacious. Otherwise I could never have gone on listening to Vinteuil. I was just going from one bronchitis to another.\u201d I could not refrain from alluding to Mlle. Vinteuil. \u201cIsn\u2019t the composer\u2019s daughter to be here,\u201d I asked Mme. Verdurin, \u201cwith one of her friends?\u201d \u201cNo, I have just had a telegram,\u201d Mme. Verdurin said evasively, \u201cthey have been obliged to remain in the country.\u201d I felt a momentary hope that there might never have been any question of their leaving it and that Mme. Verdurin had announced the presence of these representatives of the composer only in order to make a favourable impression upon the performers and their audience. \u201cWhat, didn\u2019t they come, then, to the rehearsal this afternoon?\u201d came with a feigned curiosity from the Baron who was anxious to let it appear that he had not seen Charlie. The latter came up to greet me. I whispered a question in his ear about Mlle. Vinteuil; he seemed to me to know little or nothing about her. I signalled to him not to let himself be heard and told him that we should discuss the question later on. He bowed, and assured me that he would be delighted to place himself entirely at my disposal. I observed that he was far more polite, more respectful, than he had been in the past. I spoke warmly of him \u2014 who might perhaps be able to help me to clear up my suspicions \u2014 to M. de Charlus who replied: \u201cHe only does what is natural, there would be no point in his living among respectable people if he didn\u2019t learn good manners.\u201d These, according to M. de Charlus, were the old manners of France, untainted by any British bluntness. Thus when Charlie, returning from a tour in the provinces or abroad, arrived in his travelling suit at the Baron\u2019s, the latter, if there were not too many people present, would kiss him without ceremony upon both cheeks, perhaps a little in order to banish by so ostentatious a display of his affection any idea of its being criminal, perhaps because he could not deny himself a pleasure, but still more, doubtless, from a literary sense, as upholding and illustrating the traditional manners of France, and, just as he would have countered the Munich or modern style of furniture by keeping in his rooms old armchairs that had come to him from a great-grandmother, countering the British phlegm with the affection of a warm-hearted father of the eighteenth century, unable to conceal his joy at beholding his son once more. Was there indeed a trace of incest in this paternal affection? It is more probable that the way in which M. de Charlus habitually appeased his vicious cravings, as to which we shall learn something in due course, was not sufficient for the need of affection, which had remained unsatisfied since the death of his wife; the fact remains that after having thought more than once of a second marriage, he was now devoured by a maniacal desire to adopt an heir. People said that he was going to adopt Morel, and there was nothing extraordinary in that. The invert who has been unable to feed his passion save on a literature written for women-loving men, who used to think of men when he read Mussel\u2019sNuits, feels the need to partake, nevertheless, in all the social activities of the man who is not an invert, to keep a lover, as the old frequenter of the Opera keeps ballet-girls, to settle down, to marry or form a permanent tie, to become a father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus took Morel aside on the pretext of making him tell him what was going to be played, but above all finding a great consolation, while Charlie shewed him his music, in displaying thus publicly their secret intimacy. In the meantime I myself felt a certain charm. For albeit the little clan included few girls, on the other hand girls were abundantly invited on the big evenings. There were a number present, and very pretty girls too, whom I knew. They wafted smiles of greeting to me across the room. The air was thus decorated at every moment with the charming smile of some girl. That is the manifold, occasional ornament of evening parties, as it is of days. We remember an atmosphere because girls were smiling in it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many people might have been greatly surprised had they overheard the furtive remarks which M. de Charlus exchanged with a number of important gentlemen at this party. These were two Dukes, a distinguished General, a great writer, a great physician, a great barrister. And the remarks in question were: \u201cBy the way, did you notice the footman, I mean the little fellow they take on the carriage? At our cousin Guermantes\u2019, you don\u2019t know of anyone?\u201d \u201cAt the moment, no.\u201d \u201cI say, though, outside the door, where the carriages stop, there used to be a fair little person, in breeches, who seemed to me most attractive. She called my carriage most charmingly, I would gladly have prolonged the conversation.\u201d \u201cYes, but I believe she\u2019s altogether against it, besides, she puts on airs, you like to get to business at once, you would loathe her. Anyhow, I know there\u2019s nothing doing, a friend of mine tried.\u201d \u201cThat is a pity, I thought the profile very fine, and the hair superb.\u201d \u201cReally, as much as that? I think, if you had seen a little more of her, you would have been disillusioned. No, in the supper-room, only two months ago you would have seen a real marvel, a great fellow six foot six, a perfect skin, and loves it, too. But he\u2019s gone off to Poland.\u201d \u201cAh, that is rather a long way.\u201d \u201cYou never know, he may come back, perhaps. One always meets again somewhere.\u201d There is no great social function that does not, if, in taking a section of it, we contrive to cut sufficiently deep, resemble those parties to which doctors invite their patients, who utter the most intelligent remarks, have perfect manners, and would never shew that they were mad did they not whisper in our ear, pointing to some old gentleman who goes past: \u201cThat\u2019s Joan of Arc.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI feel that it is our duty to enlighten him,\u201d Mme. Verdurin said to Brichot. \u201cNot that I have anything against Charlus, far from it. He is a pleasant fellow and as for his reputation, I don\u2019t mind saying that it is not of a sort that can do me any harm! As far as I\u2019m concerned, in our little clan, in our table-talk, as I detest flirts, the men who talk nonsense to a woman in a corner instead of discussing interesting topics, I\u2019ve never had any fear with Charlus of what happened to me with Swann, and Elstir, and lots of them. With him I was quite safe, he would come to my dinners, all the women in the world might be there, you could be certain that the general conversation would not be disturbed by flirtations and whisperings. Charlus is in a class of his own, one doesn\u2019t worry, he might be a priest. Only, he must not be allowed to take it upon himself to order about the young men who come to the house and make a nuisance of himself in our little nucleus, or he\u2019ll be worse than a man who runs after women.\u201d And Mme. Verdurin was sincere in thus proclaiming her indulgence towards Charlism. Like every ecclesiastical power she regarded human frailties as less dangerous than anything that might undermine the principle of authority, impair the orthodoxy, modify the ancient creed of her little Church. \u201cIf he does, then I shall bare my teeth. What do you say to a gentleman who tried to prevent Charlie from coming to a rehearsal because he himself was not invited? So he\u2019s going to be taught a lesson, I hope he\u2019ll profit by it, otherwise he can simply take his hat and go. He keeps the boy under lock and key, upon my word he does.\u201d And, using exactly the same expressions that almost anyone else might have used, for there are certain not in common currency which some particular subject, some given circumstance recalls almost inevitably to the mind of the speaker, who imagines that he is giving free expression to his thought when he is merely repeating mechanically the universal lesson, she went on: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to see Morel nowadays without that great lout hanging round him, like an armed escort.\u201d M. Verdurin offered to take Charlie out of the room for a minute to explain things to him, on the pretext of asking him a question. Mme. Verdurin was afraid that this might upset him, and that he would play badly in consequence. It would be better to postpone this performance until after the other. Perhaps even until a later occasion. For however Mme. Verdurin might look forward to the delicious emotion that she would feel when she knew that her husband was engaged in enlightening Charlie in the next room, she was afraid, if the shot missed fire, that he would lose his temper and would fail to reappear on the sixteenth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What ruined M. de Charlus that evening was the ill-breeding \u2014 so common in their class \u2014 of the people whom he had invited and who were now beginning to arrive. Having come there partly out of friendship for M. de Charlus and also out of curiosity to explore these novel surroundings, each Duchess made straight for the Baron as though it were he who was giving the party and said, within a yard of the Verdurins, who could hear every word: \u201cShew me which is mother Verdurin; do you think I really need speak to her? I do hope at least, that she won\u2019t put my name in the paper to-morrow, nobody would ever speak to me again. What! That woman with the white hair, but she looks quite presentable.\u201d Hearing some mention of Mlle. Vinteuil, who, however, was not in the room, more than one of them said: \u201cAh! The sonata-man\u2019s daughter? Shew me her\u201d and, each finding a number of her friends, they formed a group by themselves, watched, sparkling with ironical curiosity, the arrival of the faithful, able at the most to point a finger at the odd way in which a person had done her hair, who, a few years later, was to make this the fashion in the very best society, and, in short, regretted that they did not find this house as different from the houses that they knew, as they had hoped to find it, feeling the disappointment of people in society who, having gone to the Bo\u00eete \u00e0 Bruant in the hope that the singer would make a butt of them, find themselves greeted on their arrival with a polite bow instead of the expected:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ah! voyez c\u2019te gueule, c\u2019te binette\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ah! voyez c\u2019te gueule qu\u2019elle a\n\nM. de Charlus had, at Balbec, given me a perspicacious criticism of Mme. de Vaugoubert who, notwithstanding her keen intellect, had brought about, after his unexpected prosperity, the irremediable disgrace of her husband. The rulers to whose Court M. de Vaugoubert was accredited, King Theodosius and Queen Eudoxia, having returned to Paris, but this time for a prolonged visit, daily festivities had been held in their honour, in the course of which the Queen, on the friendliest terms with Mme. de Vaugoubert, whom she had seen for the last ten years in her own capital, and knowing neither the wife of the President of the Republic nor those of his Ministers, had neglected these ladies and kept entirely aloof with the Ambassadress. This lady, believing her own position to be unassailable \u2014 M. de Vaugoubert having been responsible for the alliance between King Theodosius and France \u2014 had derived from the preference that the Queen shewed for her society a proud satisfaction but no anxiety at the peril that threatened her, which took shape a few months later in the fact, wrongly considered impossible by the too confident couple, of the brutal dismissal from the Service of M. de Vaugoubert. M. de Charlus, remarking in the \u2018crawler\u2019 upon the downfall of his lifelong friend, expressed his astonishment that an intelligent woman had not, in such circumstances, brought all her influence with the King and Queen to bear, so as to secure that she might not seem to possess any influence, and to make them transfer to the wives of the President and his Ministers a civility by which those ladies would have been all the more flattered, that is to say which would have made them more inclined, in their satisfaction, to be grateful to the Vaugouberts, inasmuch as they would have supposed that civility to be spontaneous, and not dictated by them. But the man who can see the mistakes of others need only be exhilarated by circumstances in order to succumb to them himself. And M, de Charlus, while his guests fought their way towards him, to come and congratulate him, thank him, as though he were the master of the house, never thought of asking them to say a few words to Mme. Verdurin. Only the Queen of Naples, in whom survived the same noble blood that had flowed in the veins of her sisters the Empress Elisabeth and the Duchesse d\u2019Alen\u00e7on, made a point of talking to Mme. Verdurin as though she had come for the pleasure of meeting her rather than for the music and for M. de Charlus, made endless pretty speeches to her hostess, could not cease from telling her for how long she had been wishing to make her acquaintance, expressed her admiration for the house and spoke to her of all manner of subjects as though she were paying a call. She would so much have liked to bring her niece Elisabeth, she said (the niece who shortly afterwards was to marry Prince Albert of Belgium), who would be so sorry. She stopped talking when she saw the musicians mount the platform, asking which of them was Morel. She can scarcely have been under any illusion as to the motives that led M. de Charlus to desire that the young virtuoso should be surrounded with so much glory. But the venerable wisdom of a sovereign in whose veins flowed the blood of one of the noblest races in history, one of the richest in experience, scepticism and pride, made her merely regard the inevitable defects of the people whom she loved best, such as her cousin Charlus (whose mother had been, like herself, a \u2018Duchess in Bavaria\u2019), as misfortunes that rendered more precious to them the support that they might find in herself and consequently made it even more pleasant to her to provide that support. She knew that M. de Charlus would be doubly touched by her having taken the trouble to come, in the circumstances. Only, being as good as she had long ago shewn herself brave, this heroic woman who, a soldier-queen, had herself fired her musket from the ramparts of Gaeta, always ready to take her place chivalrously by the weaker side, seeing Mme. Verdurin alone and abandoned, and unaware (for that matter) that she ought not to leave the Queen, had sought to pretend that for her, the Queen of Naples, the centre of this party, the lodestone that had made her come was Mme. Verdurin. She expressed her regret that she would not be able to remain until the end, as she had, although she never went anywhere, to go on to another party, and begged that on no account, when she had to go, should any fuss be made for her, thus discharging Mme. Verdurin of the honours which the latter did not even know that she ought to render\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One must, however, do M. de Charlus the justice of saying that, if he entirely forgot Mme. Verdurin and allowed her to be ignored, to a scandalous extent, by the people \u2018of his own world\u2019 whom he had invited, he did, on the other hand, realise that he must not allow these people to display, during the \u2018symphonic recital\u2019 itself, the bad manners which they were exhibiting towards the Mistress. Morel had already mounted the platform, the musicians were assembling, and one could still hear conversations, not to say laughter, speeches such as \u201cit appears, one has to be initiated to understand it.\u201d Immediately M. de Charlus, drawing himself erect, as though he had entered a different body from that which I had seen, not an hour ago, crawling towards Mme. Verdurin\u2019s door, assumed a prophetic expression and regarded the assembly with an earnestness which indicated that this was not the moment for laughter, whereupon one saw a rapid blush tinge the cheeks of more than one lady thus publicly rebuked, like a schoolgirl scolded by her teacher in front of the whole class. To my mind, M. de Charlus\u2019s attitude, noble as it was, was somehow slightly comic; for at one moment he pulverised his guests with a flaming glare, at another, in order to indicate to them as with a vade mecum the religious silence that ought to be observed, the detachment from every worldly consideration, he furnished in himself, as he raised to his fine brow his white-gloved hands, a model (to which they must conform) of gravity, already almost of ecstasy, without acknowledging the greetings of late-comers so indelicate as not to understand that it was now the time for High Art. They were all hypnotised; no one dared utter a sound, move a chair; respect for music \u2014 by virtue of Palam\u00e8de\u2019s prestige \u2014 had been instantaneously inculcated in a crowd as ill-bred as it was exclusive\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I saw appear on the little platform, not only Morel and a pianist, but performers upon other instruments as well, I supposed that the programme was to begin with works of composers other than Vinteuil. For I imagined that the only work of his in existence was his sonata for piano and violin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin sat in a place apart, the twin hemispheres of her pale, slightly roseate brow magnificently curved, her hair drawn back, partly in imitation of an eighteenth century portrait, partly from the desire for coolness of a fever-stricken patient whom modesty forbids to reveal her condition, aloof, a deity presiding over musical rites, patron saint of Wagnerism and sick-headaches, a sort of almost tragic Norn, evoked by the spell of genius in the midst of all these bores, in whose presence she would more than ordinarily scorn to express her feelings upon hearing a piece of music which she knew better than they. The concert began, I did not know what they were playing, I found myself in a strange land. Where was I to locate it? Into what composer\u2019s country had I come? I should have been glad to know, and, seeing nobody near me whom I might question, I should have liked to be a character in those Arabian Nights which I never tired of reading and in which, in moments of uncertainty, there arose a genie or a maiden of ravishing beauty, invisible to everyone else but not to the embarrassed hero to whom she reveals exactly what he wishes to learn. Well, at this very moment I was favoured with precisely such a magical apparition. As, in a stretch of country which we suppose to be strange to us and which as a matter of fact we have approached from a new angle, when after turning out of one road we find ourself emerging suddenly upon another every inch of which is familiar only we have not been in the habit of entering it from that end, we say to ourself immediately: \u201cWhy, this is the lane that leads to the garden gate of my friends the X\u2014\u2014 I shall be there in a minute,\u201d and there, indeed, is their daughter at the gate, come out to greet us as we pass; so, all of a sudden, I found myself, in the midst of this music that was novel to me, right in the heart of Vinteuil\u2019s sonata; and, more marvellous than any maiden, the little phrase, enveloped, harnessed in silver, glittering with brilliant effects of sound, as light and soft as silken scarves, came towards me, recognisable in this new guise. My joy at having found it again was enhanced by the accent, so friendlily familiar, which it adopted in addressing me, so persuasive, so simple, albeit without dimming the shimmering beauty with which it was resplendent. Its intention, however, was, this time, merely to shew me the way, which was not the way of the sonata, for this was an unpublished work of Vinteuil in which he had merely amused himself, by an allusion which was explained at this point by a sentence in the programme which one ought to have been reading simultaneously, in making the little phrase reappear for a moment. No sooner was it thus recalled than it vanished, and I found myself once more in an unknown world, but I knew now, and everything that followed only confirmed my knowledge, that this world was one of those which I had never even been capable of imagining that Vinteuil could have created, for when, weary of the sonata which was to me a universe thoroughly explored, I tried to imagine others equally beautiful but different, I was merely doing what those poets do who fill their artificial paradise with meadows, flowers and streams which duplicate those existing already upon Earth. What was now before me made me feel as keen a joy as the sonata would have given me if I had not already known it, and consequently, while no less beautiful, was different. Whereas the sonata opened upon a dawn of lilied meadows, parting its slender whiteness to suspend itself over the frail and yet consistent mingling of a rustic bower of honeysuckle with white geraniums, it was upon continuous, level surfaces like those of the sea that, in the midst of a stormy morning beneath an already lurid sky, there began, in an eery silence, in an infinite void, this hew masterpiece, and it was into a roseate dawn that, in order to construct itself progressively before me, this unknown universe was drawn from silence and from night. This so novel redness, so absent from the tender, rustic, pale sonata, tinged all the sky, as dawn does, with a mysterious hope. And a song already thrilled the air, a song on seven notes, but the strangest, the most different from any that I had ever imagined, from any that I could ever have been able to imagine, at once ineffable and piercing, no longer the cooing of a dove as in the sonata, but rending the air, as vivid as the scarlet tinge in which the opening bars had been bathed, something like the mystical crow of a cock, an ineffable but over-shrill appeal of the eternal morning. The cold atmosphere, soaked in rain, electric \u2014 of a quality so different, feeling wholly other pressures, in a world so remote from that, virginal and endowed only with vegetable life, of the sonata \u2014 changed at every moment, obliterating the empurpled promise of the Dawn. At noon, however, beneath a scorching though transitory sun, it seemed to fulfil itself in a dull, almost rustic bliss in which the peal of clanging, racing bells (like those which kindled the blaze of the square outside the church of Combray, which Vinteuil, who must often have heard them, had perhaps discovered at that moment in his memory like a colour which the painter\u2019s hand has conveyed to his palette) seemed to materialise the coarsest joy. To be honest, from the aesthetic point of view, this joyous motive did not appeal to me, I found it almost ugly, its rhythm dragged so laboriously along the ground that one might have succeeded in imitating almost everything that was essential to it by merely making a noise, sounds, by the tapping of drumsticks upon a table. It seemed to me that Vinteuil had been lacking, here, in inspiration, and consequently I was a little lacking also in the power of attention\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I looked at the Mistress, whose sullen immobility seemed to be protesting against the noddings \u2014 in time with the music \u2014 of the empty heads of the ladies of the Faubourg. She did not say: \u201cYou understand that I know something about this music, and more than a little! If I had to express all that I feel, you would never hear the end of it!\u201d She did not say this. But her upright, motionless body, her expressionless eyes, her straying locks said it for her. They spoke also of her courage, said that the musicians might go on, need not spare her nerves, that she would not flinch at the andante, would not cry out at the allegro. I looked at the musicians. The violoncellist dominated the instrument which he clutched between his knees, bowing his head to which its coarse features gave, in moments of mannerism, an involuntary expression of disgust; he leaned over it, fingered it with the same domestic patience with which he might have plucked a cabbage, while by his side the harpist (a mere girl) in a short skirt, bounded on either side by the lines of her golden quadrilateral like those which, in the magic chamber of a Sibyl, would arbitrarily denote the ether, according to the consecrated rules, seemed to be going in quest, here and there, at the point required, of an exquisite sound, just as though, a little allegorical deity, placed in front of the golden trellis of the heavenly vault, she were gathering, one by one, its stars. As for Morel, a lock, hitherto invisible and lost in the rest of his hair, had fallen loose and formed a curl upon his brow. I turned my head slightly towards the audience to discover what M. de Charlus might be feeling at the sight of this curl. But my eyes encountered only the face, or rather the hands of Mme. Verdurin, for the former was entirely buried in the latter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But very soon, the triumphant motive of the bells having been banished, dispersed by others, I succumbed once again to the music; and I began to realise that if, in the body of this septet, different elements presented themselves in turn, to combine at the close, so also Vinteuil\u2019s sonata, and, as I was to find later on, his other works as well, had been no more than timid essays, exquisite but very slight, towards the triumphant and complete masterpiece which was revealed to me at this moment. And so too, I could not help recalling how I had thought of the other worlds which Vinteuil might have created as of so many universes as hermetically sealed as each of my own love-affairs, whereas in reality I was obliged to admit that in the volume of my latest love \u2014 that is to say, my love for Albertine \u2014 my first inklings of love for her (at Balbec at the very beginning, then after the game of ferret, then on the night when she slept at the hotel, then in Paris on the foggy afternoon, then on the night of the Guermantes\u2019 party, then at Balbec again, and finally in Paris where my life was now closely linked to her own) had been nothing more than experiments; indeed, if I were to consider, not my love for Albertine, but my life as a whole, my earlier love-affairs had themselves been but slight and timid essays, experiments, which paved the way to this vaster love: my love for Albertine. And I ceased to follow the music, in order to ask myself once again whether Albertine had or had not seen Mlle. Vinteuil during the last few days, as we interrogate afresh an internal pain, from which we have been distracted for a moment. For it was in myself that Albertine\u2019s possible actions were performed. Of each of the people whom we know we possess a double, but it is generally situated on the horizon of our imagination, of our memory; it remains more or less external to ourselves, and what it has done or may have done has no greater capacity to cause us pain than an object situated at a certain distance, which provides us with only the painless sensations of vision. The things that affect these people we perceive in a contemplative fashion, we are able to deplore them in appropriate language which gives other people a sense of our kindness of heart, we do not feel them; but since the wound inflicted on me at Balbec, it was in my heart, at a great depth, difficult to extract, that Albertine\u2019s double was lodged. What I saw of her hurt me, as a sick man would be hurt whose senses were so seriously deranged that the sight of a colour would be felt by him internally like a knife-thrust in his living flesh. It was fortunate that I had not already yielded to the temptation to break with Albertine; the boring thought that I should have to see her again presently, when I went home, was a trifling matter compared with the anxiety that I should have felt if the separation had been permanent at this moment when I felt a doubt about her before she had had time to become immaterial to me. At the moment when I pictured her thus to myself waiting for me at home, like a beloved wife who found the time of waiting long, and had perhaps fallen asleep for a moment in her room, I was caressed by the passage of a tender phrase, homely and domestic, of the septet. Perhaps \u2014 everything is so interwoven and superimposed in our inward life \u2014 it had been inspired in Vinteuil by his daughter\u2019s sleep \u2014 his daughter, the cause to-day of all my troubles \u2014 when it enveloped in its quiet, on peaceful evenings, the work of the composer, this phrase which calmed me so, by the same soft background of silence which pacifies certain of Schumann\u2019s reveries, during which, even when \u2018the Poet is speaking,\u2019 one can tell that \u2018the child is asleep.\u2019 Asleep, awake, I should find her again this evening, when I chose to return home, Albertine, my little child. And yet, I said to myself, something more mysterious than Albertine\u2019s love seemed to be promised at the outset of this work, in those first cries of dawn. I endeavoured to banish the thought of my mistress, so as to think only of the composer. Indeed, he seemed to be present. One would have said that, reincarnate, the composer lived for all time in his music; one could feel the joy with which he was choosing the colour of some sound, harmonising it with the rest. For with other and more profound gifts Vinteuil combined that which few composers, and indeed few painters have possessed, of using colours not merely so lasting but so personal that, just as time has been powerless to fade them, so the disciples who imitate him who discovered them, and even the masters who surpass him do not pale their originality. The revolution that their apparition has effected does not live to see its results merge unacknowledged in the work of subsequent generations; it is liberated, it breaks out again, and alone, whenever the innovator\u2019s works are performed in all time to come. Each note underlined itself in a colour which all the rules in the world could not have taught the most learned composers to imitate, with the result that Vinteuil, albeit he had appeared at his hour and was fixed in his place in the evolution of music, would always leave that place to stand in the forefront, whenever any of his compositions was performed, which would owe its appearance of having blossomed after the works of other more recent composers to this quality, apparently paradoxical and actually deceiving, of permanent novelty. A page of symphonic music by Vinteuil, familiar already on the piano, when one heard it rendered by an orchestra, like a ray of summer sunlight which the prism of the window disintegrates before it enters a dark dining-room, revealed like an unsuspected, myriad-hued treasure all the jewels of the Arabian Nights. But how can one compare to that motionless brilliance of light what was life, perpetual and blissful motion? This Vinteuil, whom I had known so timid and sad, had been capable \u2014 when he had to select a tone, to blend another with it \u2014 of audacities, had enjoyed a good fortune, in the full sense of the word, as to which the hearing of any of his works left one in no doubt. The joy that such chords had aroused in him, the increase of strength that it had given him wherewith to discover others led the listener on also from one discovery to another, or rather it was the composer himself who guided him, deriving from the colours that he had invented a wild joy which gave him the strength to discover, to fling himself upon the others which they seemed to evoke, enraptured, quivering, as though from the shock of an electric spark, when the sublime came spontaneously to life at the clang of the brass, panting, drunken, maddened, dizzy, while he painted his great musical fresco, like Michelangelo strapped to his scaffold and dashing, from his supine position, tumultuous brush-strokes upon the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Vinteuil had been dead for many years; but in the sound of these instruments which he had animated, it had been given him to prolong, for an unlimited time, a part at least of his life. Of his life as a man merely? If art was indeed but a prolongation of life, was it worth while to sacrifice anything to it, was it not as unreal as life itself? If I was to listen properly to this septet, I could not pause to consider the question. No doubt the glowing septet differed singularly from the candid sonata; the timid question to which the little phrase replied, from the breathless supplication to find the fulfilment of the strange promise that had resounded, so harsh, so supernatural, so brief, setting athrob the still inert crimson of the morning sky, above the sea. And yet these so widely different phrases were composed of the same elements, for just as there was a certain universe, perceptible by us in those fragments scattered here and there, in private houses, in public galleries, which were Elstir\u2019s universe, the universe which he saw, in which he lived, so to the music of Vinteuil extended, note by note, key by key, the unknown colourings of an inestimable, unsuspected universe, made fragmentary by the gaps that occurred between the different occasions of hearing his work performed; those two so dissimilar questions which commanded the so different movements of the sonata and the septet, the former breaking into short appeals a line continuous and pure, the latter welding together into an indivisible structure a medley of scattered fragments, were nevertheless, one so calm and timid, almost detached and as though philosophic, the other so anxious, pressing, imploring, were nevertheless the same prayer, poured forth before different risings of the inward sun and merely refracted through the different mediums of other thoughts, of artistic researches carried on through the years in which he had tried to create something new. A prayer, a hope which was at heart the same, distinguishable beneath these disguises in the various works of Vinteuil, and on the other hand not to be found elsewhere than in his works. For these phrases historians of music might indeed find affinities, a pedigree in the works of other great composers, but merely for subordinate reasons, from external resemblances, from analogies which were ingeniously discovered by reasoning rather than felt by a direct impression. The impression that these phrases of Vinteuil imparted was different from any other, as though, notwithstanding the conclusions to which science seems to point, the individual did really exist. And it was precisely when he was seeking vigorously to be something new that one recognised beneath the apparent differences the profound similarities; and the deliberate resemblances that existed in the body of a work, when Vinteuil repeated once and again a single phrase, diversified it, amused himself by altering its rhythm, by making it reappear in its original form, these deliberate resemblances, the work of the intellect, inevitably superficial, never succeeded in being as striking as those resemblances, concealed, involuntary, which broke out in different colours, between the two separate masterpieces; for then Vinteuil, seeking to do something new, questioned himself, with all the force of his creative effort, reached his own essential nature at those depths, where, whatever be the question asked, it is in the same accent, that is to say its own, that it replies. Such an accent, the accent of Vinteuil, is separated from the accents of other composers by a difference far greater than that which we perceive between the voices of two people, even between the cries of two species of animal: by the difference that exists between the thoughts of those other composers and the eternal investigations of Vinteuil, the question that he put to himself in so many forms, his habitual speculation, but as free from analytical formulas of reasoning as if it were being carried out in the world of the angels, so that we can measure its depth, but without being any more able to translate it into human speech than are disincarnate spirits when, evoked by a medium, he questions them as to the mysteries of death. And even when I bore in mind the acquired originality which had struck me that afternoon, that kinship which musical critics might discover among them, it is indeed a unique accent to which rise, and return in spite of themselves those great singers that original composers are, which is a proof of the irreducibly individual existence of the soul. Though Vinteuil might try to make more solemn, more grand, or to make more sprightly and gay what he saw reflected in the mind of his audience, yet, in spite of himself, he submerged it all beneath an undercurrent which makes his song eternal and at once recognisable. This song, different from those of other singers, similar to all his own, where had Vinteuil learned, where had he heard it? Each artist seems thus to be the native of an unknown country, which he himself has forgotten, different from that from which will emerge, making for the earth, another great artist. When all is said, Vinteuil, in his latest works, seemed to have drawn nearer to that unknown country. The atmosphere was no longer the same as in the sonata, the questioning phrases became more pressing, more uneasy, the answers more mysterious; the clean-washed air of morning and evening seemed to influence even the instruments. Morel might be playing marvellously, the sounds that came from his violin seemed to me singularly piercing, almost blatant. This harshness was pleasing, and, as in certain voices, one felt in it a sort of moral virtue and intellectual superiority. But this might give offence. When his vision of the universe is modified, purified, becomes more adapted to his memory of the country of his heart, it is only natural that this should be expressed by a general alteration of sounds in the musician, as of colours in the painter. Anyhow, the more intelligent section of the public is not misled, since people declared later on that Vinteuil\u2019s last compositions were the most profound. Now no programme, no subject supplied any intellectual basis for judgment. One guessed therefore that it was a question of transposition, an increasing profundity of sound\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This lost country composers do not actually remember, but each of them remains all his life somehow attuned to it; he is wild with joy when he is singing the airs of his native land, betrays it at times in his thirst for fame, but then, in seeking fame, turns his back upon it, and it is only when he despises it that he finds it when he utters, whatever the subject with which he is dealing, that peculiar strain the monotony of which \u2014 for whatever its subject it remains identical in itself \u2014 proves the permanence of the elements that compose his soul. But is it not the fact then that from those elements, all the real residuum which we are obliged to keep to ourselves, which cannot be transmitted in talk, even by friend to friend, by master to disciple, by lover to mistress, that ineffable something which makes a difference in quality between what each of us has felt and what he is obliged to leave behind at the threshold of the phrases in which he can communicate with his fellows only by limiting himself to external points common to us all and of no interest, art, the art of a Vinteuil like that of an Elstir, makes the man himself apparent, rendering externally visible in the colours of the spectrum that intimate composition of those worlds which we call individual persons and which, without the aid of art, we should never know? A pair of wings, a different mode of breathing, which would enable us to traverse infinite space, would in no way help us, for, if we visited Mars or Venus keeping the same senses, they would clothe in the same aspect as the things of the earth everything that we should be capable of seeing. The only true voyage of discovery, the only fountain of Eternal Youth, would be not to visit strange lands but to possess other eyes, to behold the universe through the eyes of another, of a hundred others, to behold the hundred universes that each of them beholds, that each of them is; and this we can contrive with an Elstir, with a Vinteuil; with men like these we do really fly from star to star. The andante had just ended upon a phrase filled with a tenderness to which I had entirely abandoned myself; there followed, before the next movement, a short interval during which the performers laid down their instruments and the audience exchanged impressions. A Duke, in order to shew that he knew what he was talking about, declared: \u201cIt is a difficult thing to play well.\u201d Other more entertaining people conversed for a moment with myself. But what were their words, which like every human and external word, left me so indifferent, compared with the heavenly phrase of music with which I had just been engaged? I was indeed like an angel who, fallen from the inebriating bliss of paradise, subsides into the most humdrum reality. And, just as certain creatures are the last surviving testimony to a form of life which nature has discarded, I asked myself if music were not the unique example of what might have been \u2014 if there had not come the invention of language, the formation of words, the analysis of ideas \u2014 the means of communication between one spirit and another. It is like a possibility which has ended in nothing; humanity has developed along other lines, those of spoken and written language. But this return to the unanalysed was so inebriating, that on emerging from that paradise, contact with people who were more or less intelligent seemed to me of an extraordinary insignificance. People \u2014 I had been able during the music to remember them, to blend them with it; or rather I had blended with the music little more than the memory of one person only, which was Albertine. And the phrase that ended the andante seemed to me so sublime that I said to myself that it was a pity that Albertine did not know it, and, had she known it, would not have understood what an honour it was to be blended with anything so great as this phrase which brought us together, and the pathetic voice of which she seemed to have borrowed. But, once the music was interrupted, the people who were present seemed utterly lifeless. Refreshments were handed round. M. de Charlus accosted a footman now and then with: \u201cHow are you? Did you get my note? Can you come?\u201d No doubt there was in these remarks the freedom of the great nobleman who thinks he is flattering his hearer and is himself more one of the people than a man of the middle classes; there was also the cunning of the criminal who imagines that anything which he volunteers is on that account regarded as innocent. And he added, in the Guermantes tone of Mme. de Villeparisis: \u201cHe\u2019s a good young fellow, such a good sort, I often employ him at home.\u201d But his adroitness turned against the Baron, for people thought his intimate conversation and correspondence with footmen extraordinary. The footmen themselves were not so much flattered as embarrassed, in the presence of their comrades. Meanwhile the septet had begun again and was moving towards its close; again and again one phrase or another from the sonata recurred, but always changed, its rhythm and harmony different, the same and yet something else, as things recur in life; and they were phrases of the sort which, without our being able to understand what affinity assigns to them as their sole and necessary home the past life of a certain composer, are to be found only in his work, and appear constantly in it, where they are the fairies, the dryads, the household gods; I had at the start distinguished in the septet two or three which reminded me of the sonata. Presently \u2014 bathed in the violet mist which rose particularly in Vinteuil\u2019s later work, so much so that, even when he introduced a dance measure, it remained captive in the heart of an opal \u2014 I caught the sound of another phrase from the sonata, still hovering so remote that I barely recognised it; hesitating, it approached, vanished as though in alarm, then returned, joined hands with others, come, as I learned later on, from other works, summoned yet others which became in their turn attractive and persuasive, as soon as they were tamed, and took their places in the ring, a ring divine but permanently invisible to the bulk of the audience, who, having before their eyes only a thick veil through which they saw nothing, punctuated arbitrarily with admiring exclamations a continuous boredom which was becoming deadly. Then they withdrew, save one which I saw reappear five times or six, without being able to distinguish its features, but so caressing, so different \u2014 as was no doubt the little phrase in Swann\u2019s sonata \u2014 from anything that any woman had ever made me desire, that this phrase which offered me in so sweet a voice a happiness which would really have been worth the struggle to obtain it, is perhaps \u2014 this invisible creature whose language I did not know and whom I understood so well \u2014 the only Stranger that it has ever been my good fortune to meet. Then this phrase broke up, was transformed, like the little phrase in the sonata, and became the mysterious appeal of the start. A phrase of a plaintive kind rose in opposition to it, but so profound, so vague, so internal, almost so organic and visceral that one could not tell at each of its repetitions whether they were those of a theme or of an attack of neuralgia. Presently these two motives were wrestling together in a close fight in which now one disappeared entirely, and now the listener could catch only a fragment of the other. A wrestling match of energies only, to tell the truth; for if these creatures attacked one another, it was rid of their physical bodies, of their appearance, of their names, and finding in me an inward spectator, himself indifferent also to their names and to all details, interested only in their immaterial and dynamic combat and following with passion its sonorous changes. In the end the joyous motive was left triumphant; it was no longer an almost anxious appeal addressed to an empty sky, it was an ineffable joy which seemed to come from paradise, a joy as different from that of the sonata as from a grave and gentle angel by Bellini, playing the theorbo, would be some archangel by Mantegna sounding a trump. I might be sure that this new tone of joy, this appeal to a super-terrestrial joy, was a thing that I would never forget. But should I be able, ever, to realise it? This question seemed to me all the more important, inasmuch as this phrase was what might have seemed most definitely to characterise \u2014 from its sharp contrast with all the rest of my life, with the visible world \u2014 those impressions which at remote intervals I recaptured in my life as starting-points, foundation-stones for the construction of a true life: the impression that I had felt at the sight of the steeples of Martinville, or of a line of trees near Balbec. In any case, to return to the particular accent of this phrase, how strange it was that the presentiment most different from what life assigns to us on earth, the boldest approximation to the bliss of the world beyond should have been materialised precisely in the melancholy, respectable little old man whom we used to meet in the Month of Mary at Combray; but, stranger still, how did it come about that this revelation, the strangest that I had yet received, of an unknown type of joy, should have come to me from him, since, it was understood, when he died he left nothing behind him but his sonata, all the rest being non-existent in indecipherable scribbljngs. Indecipherable they may have been, but they had nevertheless been in the end deciphered, by dint of patience, intelligence and respect, by the only person who had lived sufficiently in Vinteuil\u2019s company to understand his method of working, to interpret his orchestral indications: Mlle. Vinteuil\u2019s friend. Even in the lifetime of the great composer, she had acquired from his daughter the reverence that the latter felt for her father. It was because of this reverence that, in those moments in which people run counter to their natural inclinations, the two girls had been able to find an insane pleasure in the profanations which have already been narrated. (Her adoration of her father was the primary condition of his daughter\u2019s sacrilege. And no doubt they ought to have foregone the delight of that sacrilege, but it did not express the whole of their natures.) And, what is more, the profanations had become rarefied until they disappeared altogether, in proportion as their morbid carnal relations, that troubled, smouldering fire, had given place to the flame of a pure and lofty friendship. Mlle. Vinteuil\u2019s friend was sometimes worried by the importunate thought that she had perhaps hastened the death of Vinteuil. At any rate, by spending years in poring over the cryptic scroll left by him, in establishing the correct reading of those illegible hieroglyphs, Mlle. Vinteuil\u2019s friend had the consolation of assuring the composer whose grey hairs she had sent in sorrow to the grave an immortal and compensating glory. Relations which are not consecrated by the laws establish bonds of kinship as manifold, as complex, even more solid than those which spring from marriage. Indeed, without pausing to consider relations of so special a nature, do we not find every day that adultery, when it is based upon genuine love, does not upset the family sentiment, the duties of kinship, but rather revivifies them. Adultery brings the spirit into what marriage would often have left a dead letter. A good-natured girl who merely from convention will wear mourning for her mother\u2019s second husband has not tears enough to shed for the man whom her mother has chosen out of all the world as her lover. Anyhow, Mlle. Vinteuil had acted only in a spirit of Sadism, which did not excuse her, but it gave me a certain consolation to think so later on. She must indeed have realised, I told myself, at the moment when she and her friend profaned her father\u2019s photograph, that what they were doing was merely morbidity, silliness, and not the true and joyous wickedness which she would have liked to feel. This idea that it was merely a pretence of wickedness spoiled her pleasure. But if this idea recurred to her mind later on, as it had spoiled her pleasure, so it must then have diminished her grief. \u201cIt was not I,\u201d she must have told herself, \u201cI was out of my mind. I myself mean still to pray for my father\u2019s soul, not to despair of his forgiveness.\u201d Only it is possible that this idea, which had certainly presented itself to her in her pleasure, may not have presented itself in her grief. I would have liked to be able to put it into her mind. I am sure that I should have done her good and that I should have been able to reestablish between her and the memory of her father a pleasant channel of communication\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As in the illegible note-books in which a chemist of genius, who does not know that death is at hand, jots down discoveries which will perhaps remain forever unknown, Mlle. Vinteuil\u2019s friend had disentangled, from papers more illegible than strips of papyrus, dotted with a cuneiform script, the formula eternally true, forever fertile, of this unknown joy, the mystic hope of the crimson Angel of the dawn. And I to whom, albeit not so much perhaps as to Vinteuil, she had been also, she had been once more this very evening, by reviving afresh my jealousy of Albertine, she was above all in the future to be the cause of so many sufferings, it was thanks to her, in compensation, that there had been able to come to my ears the strange appeal which I should never for a moment cease to hear, as the promise and proof that there existed something other, realisable no doubt by art, than the nullity that I had found in all my pleasures and in love itself, and that if my life seemed to me so empty, at least there were still regions unexplored\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What she had enabled us, thanks to her labour, to know of Vinteuil was, to tell the truth, the whole of Vinteuil\u2019s work. Compared with this septet, certain phrases from the sonata which alone the public knew appeared so commonplace that one failed to understand how they could have aroused so much admiration. Similarly we are surprised that for years past, pieces as trivial as the Evening Star or Elisabeth\u2019s Prayer can have aroused in the concert-hall fanatical worshippers who wore themselves out in applause and in crying encore at the end of what after all is poor and trite to us who know Tristan, the Rheingold and theMeistersinger. We are left to suppose that those featureless melodies contained already nevertheless in infinitesimal, and for that reason, perhaps, more easily assimilable quantities, something of the originality of the masterpieces which, in retrospect, are alone of importance to us, but which their very perfection may perhaps have prevented from being understood; they have been able to prepare the way for them in our hearts. Anyhow it is true that, if they gave a confused presentiment of the beauties to come, they left these in a state of complete obscurity. It was the same with Vinteuil; if at his death he had left behind him \u2014 excepting certain parts of the sonata \u2014 only what he had been able to complete, what we should have known of him would have been, in relation to his true greatness, as little as, in the case of, say, Victor Hugo, if he had died after the Pas d\u2019Armes du Roi Jean, the Fianc\u00e9e du Timbalier and Sarah la Baigneuse, without having written a line of the L\u00e9gende des Si\u00e8cles or the Contemplations: what is to us his real work would have remained purely potential, as unknown as those universes to which our perception does not attain, of which we shall never form any idea\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anyhow, the apparent contrast, that profound union between genius (talent too and even virtue) and the sheath of vices in which, as had happened in the case of Vinteuil, it is so frequently contained, preserved, was legible, as in a popular allegory, in the mere assembly of the guests among whom I found myself once again when the music had come to an end. This assembly, albeit limited this time to Mme. Verdurin\u2019s drawing-room, resembled many others, the ingredients of which are unknown to the general public, and which philosophical journalists, if they are at all well-informed, call Parisian, or Panamist, or Dreyfusard, never suspecting that they may equally well be found in Petersburg, Berlin, Madrid, and at every epoch; if as a matter of fact the Under Secretary of State for Fine Arts, an artist to his fingertips, well-bred and smart, several Duchesses and three Ambassadors with their wives were present this evening at Mme. Verdurin\u2019s, the proximate, immediate cause of their presence lay in the relations that existed between M. de Charlus and Morel, relations which made the Baron anxious to give as wide a celebrity as possible to the artistic triumphs of his young idol, and to obtain for him the Cross of the Legion of Honour; the remoter cause which had made this assembly possible was that a girl living with Mlle. Vinteuil in the same way as the Baron was living with Charlie had brought to light a whole series of works of genius which had been such a revelation that before long a subscription was to be opened under the patronage of the Minister of Education, with the object of erecting a statue of Vinteuil. Moreover, these works had been assisted, no less than by Mlle. Vinteuil\u2019s relations with her friend, by the Baron\u2019s relations with Charlie, a sort of cross-road, a short cut, thanks to which the world was enabled to overtake these works without the preliminary circuit, if not of a want of comprehension which would long persist, at least of a complete ignorance which might have lasted for years. Whenever an event occurs which is within the range of the vulgar mind of the moralising journalist, a political event as a rule, the moralising journalists are convinced that there has been some great change in France, that we shall never see such evenings again, that no one will ever again admire Ibsen, Renan, Dosto\u00efevski, D\u2019Annunzio, Tolstoi, Wagner, Strauss. For moralising journalists take their text from the equivocal undercurrents of these official manifestations, in order to find something decadent in the art which is there celebrated and which as often as not is more austere than any other. But there is no name among those most revered by these moralising journalists which has not quite naturally given rise to some such strange gathering, although its strangeness may have been less flagrant and better concealed. In the case of this gathering, the impure elements that associated themselves with it struck me from another aspect; to be sure, I was as well able as anyone to dissociate them, having learned to know them separately, but anyhow it came to pass that some of them, those which concerned Mlle. Vinteuil and her friend, speaking to me of Combray, spoke to me also of Albertine, that is to say of Balbec, since it was because I had long ago seen Mlle. Vinteuil at Montjouvain and had learned of her friend\u2019s intimacy with Albertine, that I was presently, when I returned home, to find, instead of solitude, Albertine awaiting me, and that the others, those which concerned Morel and M. de Charlus, speaking to me of Balbec, where I had seen, on the platform at Donci\u00e8res, their intimacy begin, spoke to me of Combray and of its two \u2018ways,\u2019 for M. de Charlus was one of those Guermantes, Counts of Combray, inhabiting Combray without having any dwelling there, between earth and heaven, like Gilbert the Bad in his window: while, after all, Morel was the son of that old valet who had enabled me to know the lady in pink, and had permitted me, years after, to identify her with Mme. Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus repeated, when, the music at an end, his guests came, to say good-bye to him, the same error that he had made when they arrived. He did not ask them to shake hands with their hostess, to include her and her husband in the gratitude that was being showered on himself. There was a long queue waiting, but a queue that led to the Baron alone, a fact of which he must have been conscious, for as he said to me a little later: \u201cThe form of the artistic celebration ended in a \u2018few-words-in-the-vestry\u2019 touch that was quite amusing.\u201d The guests even prolonged their expressions of gratitude with indiscriminate remarks which enabled them to remain for a moment longer in the Baron\u2019s presence, while those who had not yet congratulated him on the success of his party hung wearily in the rear. A stray husband or two may have announced his intention of going; but his wife, a snob as well as a Duchess, protested: \u201cNo, no, even if we are kept waiting an hour, we cannot go away without thanking Palam\u00e8de, who has taken so much trouble. There is nobody else left now who can give entertainments like this.\u201d Nobody would have thought of asking to be introduced to Mme. Verdurin any more than to the attendant in a theatre to which some great lady has for one evening brought the whole aristocracy. \u201cWere you at Eliane de Montmorency\u2019s yesterday, cousin?\u201d asked Mme. de Mortemart, seeking an excuse to prolong their conversation. \u201cGood gracious, no; I like Eliane, but I never can understand her invitations. I must be very stupid, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d he went on, parting his lips in a broad smile, while Mme. de Mortemart realised that she was to be made the first recipient of \u2018one of Palam\u00e8de\u2019s\u2019 as she had often been of \u2018one of Oriane\u2019s.\u2019\u201cI did indeed receive a card a fortnight ago from the charming Eliane. Above the questionably authentic name of \u2018Montmorency\u2019 was the following kind invitation: \u2018My dear cousin, will you please remember me next Friday at half-past nine.\u2019 Beneath were written two less gratifying words: \u2018Czech Quartet.\u2019 These seemed to me incomprehensible, and in any case to have no more connexion with the sentence above than the words \u2018My dear \u2014\u2014-,\u2019 which you find on the back of a letter, with nothing else after them, when the writer has already begun again on the other side, and has not taken a fresh sheet, either from carelessness or in order to save paper. I am fond of Eliane: and so I felt no annoyance, I merely ignored the strange and inappropriate allusion to a Czech Quartet, and, as I am a methodical man, I placed on my chimney-piece the invitation to remember Madame de Montmorency on Friday at half-past nine. Although renowned for my obedient, punctual and meek nature, as Buffon says of the camel\u201d\u2014 at this, laughter seemed to radiate from M. de Charlus who knew that on the contrary he was regarded as the most impossible person to live with \u2014\u201cI was a few minutes late (it took me a few minutes to change my clothes), and without any undue remorse, thinking that half-past nine meant ten, at the stroke of ten in a comfortable dressing-gown, with warm slippers on my feet, I sat down in my chimney corner to remember Eliane as she had asked me and with a concentration which began to relax only at half-past ten. Tell her please that I complied strictly with her audacious request. I am sure she will be gratified.\u201d Mme. de Mortemart was helpless with laughter, in which M. de Charlus joined. \u201cAnd to-morrow,\u201d she went on, forgetting that she had already long exceeded the time that might be allotted to her, \u201care you going to our La Rochefoucauld cousins?\u201d \u201cOh, that, now, is quite impossible, they have invited me, and you too, I see, to a thing it is utterly impossible to imagine, which is called, if I am to believe their card of invitation, a \u2018dancing tea.\u2019 I used to be considered pretty nimble when I was young, but I doubt whether I could ever decently have drunk a cup of tea while I was dancing. No, I have never cared for eating or drinking in unnatural positions. You will remind me that my dancing days are done. But even sitting down comfortably to drink my tea \u2014 of the quality of which I am suspicious since it is called \u2018dancing\u2019\u2014 I should be afraid lest other guests younger than myself, and less nimble possibly than I was at their age, might spill their cups over my clothes which would interfere with my pleasure in draining my own.\u201d Nor indeed was M. de Charlus content with leaving Mme. Verdurin out of the conversation while he spoke of all manner of subjects which he seemed to be taking pleasure in developing and varying, that cruel pleasure which he had always enjoyed of keeping indefinitely on their feet the friends who were waiting with an excruciating patience for their turn to come; he even criticised all that part of the entertainment for which Mme. Verdurin was responsible. \u201cBut, talking about cups, what in the world are those strange little bowls which remind me of the vessels in which, when I was a young man, people used to get sorbets from Poir\u00e9-Blanche. Somebody said to me just now that they were for \u2018iced coffee.\u2019 But if it comes to that, I have seen neither coffee nor ice. What curious little objects \u2014 so very ambiguous.\u201d In saying this M. de Charlus had placed his white-gloved hands vertically over his lips and had modestly circumscribed his indicative stare as though he were afraid of being heard, or even seen by his host and hostess. But this was a mere feint, for in a few minutes he would be offering the same criticisms to the Mistress herself, and a little later would be insolently enjoining: \u201cNo more iced-coffee cups, remember! Give them to one of your friends whose house you wish to disfigure. But warn her not to have them in the drawing-room, or people might think that they had come into the wrong room, the things are so exactly like chamberpots.\u201d \u201cBut, cousin,\u201d said the guest, lowering her own voice also, and casting a questioning glance at M. de Charlus, for she was afraid of offending not Mme. Verdurin but him, \u201cperhaps she doesn\u2019t quite know yet. . . . \u201d \u201cShe shall be taught.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d laughed the guest, \u201cshe couldn\u2019t have a better teacher! She is lucky! If you are in charge, one can be sure there won\u2019t be a false note.\u201d \u201cThere wasn\u2019t one, if it comes to that, in the music.\u201d \u201cOh! It was sublime. One of those pleasures which can never be forgotten. Talking of that marvellous violinist,\u201d she went on, imagining in her innocence that M. de Charlus was interested in the violin \u2018pure and simple,\u2019\u201cdo you happen to know one whom I heard the other day playing too wonderfully a sonata by Faur\u00e9, his name is Frank. . . . \u201d \u201cOh, he\u2019s a horror,\u201d replied M. de Charlus, overlooking the rudeness of a contradiction which implied that his cousin was lacking in taste. \u201cAs far as violinists are concerned, I advise you to confine yourself to mine.\u201d This paved the way to a fresh exchange of glances, at once furtive and scrutinous, between M. de Charlus and his cousin, for, blushing and seeking by her zeal to atone for her blunder, Mme. de Mortemart went on to suggest to M. de Charlus that she might give a party, to hear Morel play. Now, so far as she was concerned, this party had not the object of bringing an unknown talent into prominence, an object which she would, however, pretend to have in mind, and which was indeed that of M. de Charlus. She regarded it only as an opportunity for giving a particularly smart party and was calculating already whom she would invite and whom she would reject. This business of selection, the chief preoccupation of people who give parties (even the people whom \u2018society\u2019 journalists are so impudent or so foolish as to call \u2018the \u00e9lite\u2019), alters at once the expression \u2014 and the handwriting \u2014 of a hostess more profoundly than any hypnotic suggestion. Before she had even thought of what Morel was to play (which she regarded, and rightly, as a secondary consideration, for even if everybody this evening, from fear of M. de Charlus, had observed a polite silence during the music, it would never have occurred to anyone to listen to it), Mme. de Mortemart, having decided that Mme. de Valcourt was not to be one of the elect, had automatically assumed that air of conspiracy, of a secret plotting which so degrades even those women in society who can most easily afford to ignore what \u2018people will say.\u2019\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be possible for me to give a party, for people to hear your friend play?\u201d murmured Mme. de Mortemart, who, while addressing herself exclusively to M. de Charlus, could not refrain, as though under a fascination, from casting a glance at Mme. de Valcourt (the rejected) in order to make certain that the other was too far away to hear her. \u201cNo she cannot possibly hear what I am saying,\u201d Mme. de Mortemart concluded inwardly, reassured by her own glance which as a matter of fact had had a totally different effect upon Mme. de Valcourt from that intended: \u201cWhy,\u201d Mme. de Valcourt had said to herself when she caught this glance, \u201cMarie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is planning something with Palam\u00e8de which I am not to be told.\u201d \u201cYou mean my prot\u00e9g\u00e9,\u201d M. de Charlus corrected, as merciless to his cousin\u2019s choice of words as he was to her musical endowments. Then without paying the slightest attention to her silent prayers, as she made a smiling apology: \u201cWhy, yes . . . \u201d he said in a loud tone, audible throughout the room, \u201calthough there is always a risk in that sort of exportation of a fascinating personality into surroundings that must inevitably diminish his transcendent gifts and would in any case have to be adapted to them.\u201d Madame de Mortemart told herself that the aside, the pianissimo of her question had been a waste of trouble, after the megaphone through which the answer had issued. She was mistaken. Mme. de Valcourt heard nothing, for the simple reason that she did not understand a single word. Her anxiety diminished and would rapidly have been extinguished had not Mme. de Mortemart, afraid that she might have been given away and afraid of having to invite Mme. de Valcourt, with whom she was on too intimate terms to be able to leave her out if the other knew about her party beforehand, raised her eyelids once again in Edith\u2019s direction, as though not to lose sight of a threatening peril, lowering them again briskly so as not to commit herself. She intended, on the morning after the party, to write her one of those letters, the complement of the revealing glance, letters which people suppose to be subtle and which are tantamount to a full and signed confession. For instance: \u201cDear Edith, I am so sorry about you, I did not really expect you last night\u201d (\u201cHow could she have expected me,\u201d Edith would ask herself, \u201csince she never invited me?\u201d) \u201cas I know that you are not very fond of parties of that sort, which rather bore you. We should have been greatly honoured, all the same, by your company\u201d (never did Mme. de Mortemart employ the word \u2018honoured,\u2019 except in the letters in which she attempted to cloak a lie in the semblance of truth). \u201cYou know that you are always at home in our house, however, you were quite right, as it was a complete failure, like everything that is got up at a moment\u2019s notice.\u201d But already the second furtive glance darted at her had enabled Edith to grasp everything that was concealed by the complicated language of M. de Charlus. This glance was indeed so violent that, after it had struck Mme. de Valcourt, the obvious secrecy and mischievous intention that it embodied rebounded upon a young Peruvian whom Mme. de Mortemart intended, on the contrary, to invite. But being of a suspicious nature, seeing all too plainly the mystery that was being made without realising that it was not intended to mystify him, he at once conceived a violent hatred of Mme. de Mortemart and determined to play all sorts of tricks upon her, such as ordering fifty iced coffees to be sent to her house on a day when she was not giving a party, or, when she was, inserting a paragraph in the newspapers announcing that the party was postponed, and publishing false reports of her other parties, in which would figure the notorious names of all the people whom, for various reasons, a hostess does not invite or even allow to be introduced to her. Mme. de Mortemart need not have bothered herself about Mme. de Valcourt. M. de Charlus was about to spoil, far more effectively than the other\u2019s presence could spoil it, the projected party. \u201cBut, my dear cousin,\u201d she said in response to the expression \u2018adapting the surroundings,\u2019 the meaning of which her momentary state of hyperaesthesia had enabled her to discern, \u201cwe shall save you all the trouble. I undertake to ask Gilbert to arrange everything.\u201d \u201cNot on any account, all the more as he must not be invited to it. Nothing can be arranged except by myself. The first thing is to exclude all the people who have ears and hear not.\u201d M. de Charlus\u2019s cousin, who had been reckoning upon Morel as an attraction in order to give a party at which she could say that, unlike so many of her kinswomen, she had \u2018had Palam\u00e8de,\u2019 carried her thoughts abruptly, from this prestige of M. de Charlus, to all sorts of people with whom he would get her into trouble if he began interfering with the list of her guests. The thought that the Prince de Guermantes (on whose account, partly, she was anxious to exclude Mme. de Valcourt, whom he declined to meet) was not to be invited, alarmed her. Her eyes assumed an uneasy expression. \u201cIs the light, which is rather too strong, hurting you?\u201d inquired M. de Charlus with an apparent seriousness the underlying irony of which she failed to perceive. \u201cNo, not at all, I was thinking of the difficulty, not for myself of course, but for my family, if Gilbert were to hear that I had given a party without inviting him, when he never has a cat on his housetop without. . . . \u201d \u201cWhy of course, we must begin by eliminating the cat on the housetop, which could only miaow; I suppose that the din of talk has prevented you from realising that it was a question not of doing the civilities of a hostess but of proceeding to the rites customary at every true celebration.\u201d Then, deciding, not that the next person had been kept waiting too long, but that it did not do to exaggerate the favours shewn to one who had in mind not so much Morel as her own visiting-list, M. de Charlus, like a physician who cuts short a consultation when he considers that it has lasted long enough, gave his cousin a signal to withdraw, not by bidding her good night but by turning to the person immediately behind her. \u201cGood evening, Madame de Montesquieu, marvellous, wasn\u2019t it? I have not seen H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, tell her that every general abstention, even the most noble, that is to say her own, must include exceptions, if they are brilliant, as has been the case to-night. To shew that one is rare is all very well, but to subordinate one\u2019s rarity, which is only negative, to what is precious is better still. In your sister\u2019s case, and I value more than anyone her systematic absence from places where what is in store for her is not worthy of her, here to-night, on the contrary, her presence at so memorable an exhibition as this would have been apr\u00e9sidence, and would have given your sister, already so distinguished, an additional distinction.\u201d Then he turned to a third person, M. d\u2019Argencourt. I was greatly astonished to see in this room, as friendly and flattering towards M. de Charlus as he was severe with him elsewhere, insisting upon Morel\u2019s being introduced to him and telling him that he hoped he would come and see him, M. d\u2019Argencourt, that terrible scourge of men such as M. de Charlus. At the moment he was living in the thick of them. It was certainly not because he had in any sense become one of them himself. But for some time past he had practically deserted his wife for a young woman in society whom he adored. Being intelligent herself, she made him share her taste for intelligent people, and was most anxious to have M. de Charlus in her house. But above all M. d\u2019Argencourt, extremely jealous and not unduly potent, feeling that he was failing to satisfy his captive and anxious at once to introduce her to people and to keep her amused, could do so without risk to himself only by surrounding her with innocuous men, whom he thus cast for the part of guardians of his seraglio. These men found that he had become quite pleasant and declared that he was a great deal more intelligent than they had supposed, a discovery that delighted him and his mistress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The remainder of M. de Charlus\u2019s guests drifted away fairly rapidly. Several of them said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to call at the vestry\u201d (the little room in which the Baron, with Charlie by his side, was receiving congratulations, and to which he himself had given the name), \u201cbut I must let Palam\u00e8de see me so that he shall know that I stayed to the end.\u201d Nobody paid the slightest attention to Mme. Verdurin. Some pretended not to know which was she and said good night by mistake to Mme. Cottard, appealing to me for confirmation with a \u201cThat is Mme. Verdurin, ain\u2019t it?\u201d Mme. d\u2019Arpajon asked me, in the hearing of our hostess: \u201cTell me, has there ever been a Monsieur Verdurin?\u201d The Duchesses, finding none of the oddities that they expected in this place which they had hoped to find more different from anything that they already knew, made the best of a bad job by going into fits of laughter in front of Elstir\u2019s paintings; for all the rest of the entertainment, which they found more in keeping than they had expected with the style with which they were familiar, they gave the credit to M. de Charlus, saying: \u201cHow clever Palam\u00e8de is at arranging things; if he were to stage an opera in a stable or a bathroom, it would still be perfectly charming.\u201d The most noble ladies were those who shewed most fervour in congratulating M. de Charlus upon the success of a party, of the secret motive of which some of them were by no means unaware, without, however, being embarrassed by the knowledge, this class of society \u2014 remembering perhaps certain epochs in history when their own family had already arrived at an identical stage of brazenly conscious effrontery \u2014 carrying their contempt for scruples almost as far as their respect for etiquette. Several of them engaged Charlie on the spot for different evenings on which he was to come and play them Vinteuil\u2019s septet, but it never occurred to any of them to invite Mme. Verdurin. This last was already blind with fury when M. de Charlus who, his head in the clouds, was incapable of perceiving her condition, decided that it would be only decent to invite the Mistress to share his joy. And it was perhaps yielding to his literary preciosity rather than to an overflow of pride that this specialist in artistic entertainments said to Mme. Verdurin: \u201cWell, are you satisfied? I think you have reason to be; you see that when I set to work to give a party there are no half-measures. I do not know whether your heraldic knowledge enables you to gauge the precise importance of the display, the weight that I have lifted, the volume of air that I have displaced for you. You have had the Queen of Naples, the brother of the King of Bavaria, the three premier peers. If Vinteuil is Mahomet, we may say that we have brought to him some of the least movable of mountains. Bear in mind that to attend your party the Queen of Naples has come up from Neuilly, which is a great deal more difficult for her than evacuating the Two Sicilies,\u201d he went on, with a deliberate sneer, notwithstanding his admiration for the Queen. \u201cIt is an historic event. Just think that it is perhaps the first time she has gone anywhere since the fall of Gaeta. It is probable that the dictionaries of dates will record as culminating points the day of the fall of Gaeta and that of the Verdurins\u2019 party. The fan that she laid down, the better to applaud Vinteuil, deserves to become more famous than the fan that Mme. de Metternich broke because the audience hissed Wagner.\u201d \u201cWhy, she has left it here,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, momentarily appeased by the memory of the Queen\u2019s kindness to herself, and she shewed M. de Charlus the fan which was lying upon a chair. \u201cOh! What a touching spectacle!\u201d exclaimed M. de Charlus, approaching the relic with veneration. \u201cIt is all the more touching, it is so hideous; poor little Violette is incredible!\u201d And spasms of emotion and irony coursed through him alternately. \u201cOh dear, I don\u2019t know whether you feel this sort of thing as I do. Swann would positively have died of convulsions if he had seen it. I am sure, whatever price it fetches, I shall buy the fan at the Queen\u2019s sale. For she is bound to be sold up, she hasn\u2019t a penny,\u201d he went on, for he never ceased to intersperse the cruellest slanders with the most sincere veneration, albeit these sprang from two opposing natures, which, however, were combined in himself. They might even be brought to bear alternately upon the same incident. For M. de Charlus who in his comfortable state as a wealthy man ridiculed the poverty of the Queen was himself often to be heard extolling that poverty and, when anyone spoke of Princesse Mur\u00e2t, Queen of the Two Sicilies, would reply: \u201cI do not know to whom you are alluding. There is only one Queen of Naples, who is a sublime person and does not keep a carriage. But from her omnibus she annihilates every vehicle on the street and one could kneel down in the dust on seeing her drive past.\u201d \u201cI shall bequeath it to a museum. In the meantime, it must be sent back to her, so that she need not hire a cab to come and fetch it. The wisest thing, in view of the historical interest of such an object, would be to steal the fan. But that would be awkward for her \u2014 since it is probable that she does not possess another!\u201d he added, with a shout of laughter. \u201cAnyhow, you see that for my sake she came. And that is not the only miracle that I have performed. I do not believe that anyone at the present day has the power to move the people whom I have brought here. However, everyone must be given his due. Charlie and the rest of the musicians played divinely. And, my dear Mistress,\u201d he added condescendingly, \u201cyou yourself have played your part on this occasion. Your name will not be unrecorded. History has preserved that of the page who armed Joan of Arc when she set out for battle; indeed you have served as a connecting link, you have made possible the fusion between Vinteuil\u2019s music and its inspired interpreter, you have had the intelligence to appreciate the capital importance of the whole chain of circumstances which would enable the interpreter to benefit by the whole weight of a considerable \u2014 if I were not referring to myself, I would say providential \u2014 personage, whom you were clever enough to ask to ensure the success of the gathering, to bring before Morel\u2019s violin the ears directly attached to the tongues that have the widest hearing; no, no, it is not a small matter. There can be no small matter in so complete a realisation. Everything has its part. The Duras was marvellous. In fact, everything; that is why,\u201d he concluded, for he loved to administer a rebuke, \u201cI set my face against your inviting those persons \u2014 divisors who, among the overwhelming people whom I brought you would have played the part of the decimal points in a sum, reducing the others to a merely fractional value. I have a very exact appreciation of that sort of thing. You understand, we must avoid blunders when we are giving a party which ought to be worthy of Vinteuil, of his inspired interpreter, of yourself, and, I venture to say, of me. You were prepared to invite the Mol\u00e9, and everything would have been spoiled. It would have been the little contrary, neutralising drop which deprives a potion of its virtue. The electric lights would have fused, the pastry would not have come in time, the orangeade would have given everybody a stomachache. She was the one person not to invite. At the mere sound of her name, as in a fairy-tale, not a note would have issued from the brass; the flute and the hautboy would have been stricken with a sudden silence. Morel himself, even if he had succeeded in playing a few bars, would not have been in tune, and instead of Vinteuil\u2019s septet you would have had a parody of it by Beckmesser, ending amid catcalls. I, who believe strongly in personal influence, could feel quite plainly in the expansion of a certain largo, which opened itself right out like a flower, in the supreme satisfaction of the finale, which was not merely allegro but incomparably allegro, that the absence of the Mol\u00e9 was inspiring the musicians and was diffusing joy among the very instruments themselves. In any case, when one is at home to Queens one does not invite one\u2019s hall-portress.\u201d In calling her \u2018the Mol\u00e9\u2019 (as for that matter he said quite affectionately \u2018the Duras\u2019) M. de Charlus was doing the lady justice. For all these women were the actresses of society and it is true also that, even regarding her from this point of view, Comtesse Mol\u00e9 did not justify the extraordinary reputation for intelligence that she had acquired, which made one think of those mediocre actors or novelists who, at certain periods, are hailed as men of genius, either because of the mediocrity of their competitors, among whom there is no artist capable of revealing what is meant by true talent, or because of the mediocrity of the public, which, did there exist an extraordinary individuality, would be incapable of understanding it. In Mme. Mol\u00e9\u2018s case it is preferable, if not absolutely fair, to stop at the former explanation. The social world being the realm of nullity, there exist between the merits of women in society only insignificant degrees, which are at best capable of rousing to madness the rancours or the imagination of M. de Charlus. And certainly, if he spoke as he had just been speaking in this language which was a precious alloy of artistic and social elements, it was because his old-womanly anger and his culture as a man of the world furnished the genuine eloquence that he possessed with none but insignificant themes. Since the world of differences does not exist on the surface of the earth, among all the countries which our perception renders uniform, all the more reason why it should not exist in the social \u2018world.\u2019 Does it exist anywhere else? Vinteuil\u2019s septet had seemed to tell me that it did. But where? As M. de Charlus also enjoyed repeating what one person had said of another, seeking to stir up quarrels, to divide and reign, he added: \u201cYou have, by not inviting her, deprived Mme. Mol\u00e9 of the opportunity of saying: \u2018I can\u2019t think why this Mme. Verdurin should invite me. I can\u2019t imagine who these people are, I don\u2019t know them.\u2019 She was saying a year ago that you were boring her with your advances. She\u2019s a fool, never invite her again. After all, she\u2019s nothing so very wonderful. She can come to your house without making a fuss about it, seeing that I come here. In short,\u201d he concluded, \u201cit seems to me that you have every reason to thank me, for, so far as it went, everything has been perfect. The Duchesse de Guermantes did not come, but one can\u2019t tell, it was better perhaps that she didn\u2019t. We shan\u2019t bear her any grudge, and we shall remember her all the same another time, not that one can help remembering her, her very eyes say to us \u2018Forget me not!\u2019, for they are a pair of myosotes\u201d (here I thought to myself how strong the Guermantes spirit \u2014 the decision to go to one house and not to another \u2014 must be, to have outweighed in the Duchess\u2019s mind her fear of Palam\u00e8de). \u201cIn the face of so complete a success, one is tempted like Bernardin de Saint-Pierre to see everywhere the hand of Providence. The Duchesse de Duras was enchanted. She even asked me to tell you so,\u201d added M. de Charlus, dwelling upon the words as though Mme. Verdurin must regard this as a sufficient honour. Sufficient and indeed barely credible, for he found it necessary, if he was to be believed, to add, completely carried away by the madness of those whom Jupiter has decided to ruin: \u201cShe has engaged Morel to come to her house, where the same programme will be repeated, and I even think of asking her for an invitation for M. Verdurin.\u201d This civility to the husband alone was, although no such idea even occurred to M. de Charlus, the most wounding outrage to the wife who, believing herself to possess, with regard to the violinist, by virtue of a sort of ukase which prevailed in the little clan, the right to forbid him to perform elsewhere without her express authorisation, was fully determined to forbid his appearance at Mme. de Duras\u2019s party\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Baron\u2019s volubility was in itself an irritation to Mme. Verdurin who did not like people to form independent groups within their little clan. How often, even at la Raspeli\u00e8re, hearing M. de Charlus talking incessantly to Charlie instead of being content with taking his part in the so harmonious chorus of the clan, she had pointed to him and exclaimed: \u201cWhat a rattle [Mme. Verdurin uses here the word tapette, being probably unaware of its popular meaning. C. K. S. M.] he is! What a rattle! Oh, if it comes to rattles, he\u2019s a famous rattle!\u201d But this time it was far worse. Inebriated with the sound of his own voice, M. de Charlus failed to realise that by cutting down the part assigned to Mme. Verdurin and confining it within narrow limits, he was calling forth that feeling of hatred which was in her only a special, social form of jealousy. Mme. Verdurin was genuinely fond of her regular visitors, the faithful of the little clan, but wished them to be entirely devoted to their Mistress. Willing to make some sacrifice, like those jealous lovers who will tolerate a betrayal, but only under their own roof and even before their eyes, that is to say when there is no betrayal, she would allow the men to have mistresses, lovers, on condition that the affair had no social consequence outside her own house, that the tie was formed and perpetuated in the shelter of her Wednesdays. In the old days, every furtive peal of laughter that came from Odette when she conversed with Swann had gnawed her heartstrings, and so of late had every aside exchanged by Morel and the Baron; she found one consolation alone for her griefs which was to destroy the happiness of other people. She had not been able to endure for long that of the Baron. And here was this rash person precipitating the catastrophe by appearing to be restricting the Mistress\u2019s place in her little clan. Already she could see Morel going into society, without her, under the Baron\u2019s aegis. There was but a single remedy, to make Morel choose between the Baron and herself, and, relying upon the ascendancy that she had acquired over Morel by the display that she made of an extraordinary perspicacity, thanks to reports which she collected, to falsehoods which she invented, all of which served to corroborate what he himself was led to believe, and what would in time be made plain to him, thanks to the pitfalls which she was preparing, into which her unsuspecting victims would fall, relying upon this ascendancy, to make him choose herself in preference to the Baron. As for the society ladies who had been present and had not even asked to be introduced to her, as soon as she grasped their hesitations or indifference, she had said: \u201cAh! I see what they are, the sort of old good-for-nothings that are not our style, it\u2019s the last time they shall set foot in this house.\u201d For she would have died rather than admit that anyone had been less friendly to her than she had hoped. \u201cAh! My dear General,\u201d M. de Charlus suddenly exclaimed, abandoning Mme. Verdurin, as he caught sight of General Deltour, Secretary to the President of the Republic, who might be of great value in securing Charlie his Cross, and who, after asking some question of Cottard, was rapidly withdrawing: \u201cGood evening, my dear, delightful friend. So this is how you slip away without saying good-bye to me,\u201d said the Baron with a genial, self-satisfied smile, for he knew quite well that people were always glad to stay behind for a moment to talk to himself. And as, in his present state of excitement, he would answer his own questions in a shrill tone: \u201cWell, did you enjoy it? Wasn\u2019t it really fine? The andante, what? It\u2019s the most touching thing that was ever written. I defy anyone to listen to the end without tears in his eyes. Charming of you to have come. Listen, I had the most perfect telegram this morning from Froberville, who tells me that as far as the Grand Chancery goes the difficulties have been smoothed away, as the saying is.\u201d M. de Charlus\u2019s voice continued to soar at this piercing pitch, as different from his normal voice as is that of a barrister making an emphatic plea from his ordinary utterance, a phenomenon of vocal amplification by over-excitement and nervous tension analogous to that which, at her own dinner-parties, raised to so high a diapason the voice and gaze alike of Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cI intended to send you a note to-morrow by a messenger to tell you of my enthusiasm, until I could find an opportunity of speaking to you, but you have been so surrounded! Froberville\u2019s support is not to be despised, but for my own part, I have the Minister\u2019s promise,\u201d said the General. \u201cAh! Excellent. Besides, you have seen for yourself that it is only what such talent deserves. Hoyos was delighted, I didn\u2019t manage to see the Ambassadress, was she pleased? Who would not have been, except those that have ears and hear not, which does not matter so long as they have tongues and can speak.\u201d Taking advantage of the Baron\u2019s having withdrawn to speak to the General, Mme. Verdurin made a signal to Brichot. He, not knowing what Mme. Verdurin was going to say, sought to amuse her, and never suspecting the anguish that he was causing me, said to the Mistress: \u201cThe Baron is delighted that Mlle. Vinteuil and her friend did not come. They shock him terribly. He declares that their morals are appalling. You can\u2019t imagine how prudish and severe the Baron is on moral questions.\u201d Contrary to Brichot\u2019s expectation, Mme. Verdurin was not amused: \u201cHe is obscene,\u201d was her answer. \u201cTake him out of the room to smoke a cigarette with you, so that my husband can get hold of his Dulcinea without his noticing it and warn him of the abyss that is yawning at his feet.\u201d Brichot seemed to hesitate. \u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you,\u201d Mme. Verdurin went on, to remove his final scruples, \u201cthat I do not feel at all safe with a man like that in the house. I know, there are all sorts of horrible stories about him, and the police have him under supervision.\u201d And, as she possessed a certain talent of improvisation when inspired by malice, Mme. Verdurin did not stop at this: \u201cIt seems, he has been in prison. Yes, yes, I have been told by people who knew all about it. I know, too, from a person who lives in his street, that you can\u2019t imagine the ruffians that go to his house.\u201d And as Brichot, who often went to the Baron\u2019s, began to protest, Mme. Verdurin, growing animated, exclaimed: \u201cBut I can assure you! It is I who am telling you,\u201d an expression with which she habitually sought to give weight to an assertion flung out more or less at random. \u201cHe will be found murdered in his bed one of these days, as those people always are. He may not go quite as far as that perhaps, because he is in the clutches of that Jupien whom he had the impudence to send to me, and who is an ex-convict, I know it, you yourself know it, yes, for certain. He has a hold on him because of some letters which are perfectly appalling, it seems. I know it from somebody who has seen them, and told me: \u2018You would be sick on the spot if you saw them.\u2019 That is how Jupien makes him toe the line and gets all the money he wants out of him. I would sooner die a thousand times over than live in a state of terror like Charlus. In any case, if Morel\u2019s family decides to bring an action against him, I have no desire to be dragged in as an accomplice. If he goes on, it will be at his own risk, but I shall have done my duty. What is one to do? It\u2019s no joke, I can tell you.\u201d And, agreeably warmed already by the thought of her husband\u2019s impending conversation with the violinist, Mme. Verdurin said to me: \u201cAsk Brichot whether I am not a courageous friend, and whether I am not capable of sacrificing myself to save my comrades.\u201d (She was alluding to the circumstances in which she had, just in time, made him quarrel, first of all with his laundress, and then with Mme. de Cambremer, quarrels as a result of which Brichot had become almost completely blind, and [people said] had taken to morphia.) \u201cAn incomparable friend, far-sighted and valiant,\u201d replied the Professor with an innocent emotion. \u201cMme. Verdurin prevented me from doing something extremely foolish,\u201d Brichot told me when she had left us. \u201cShe never hesitates to operate without anaesthetics. She is an interventionist, as our friend Cottard says. I admit, however, that the thought that the poor Baron is still unconscious of the blow that is going to fall upon him distresses me deeply. He is quite mad about that boy. If Mme. Verdurin should prove successful, there is a man who is going to be very miserable. However, it is not certain that she will not fail. I am afraid that she may only succeed in creating a misunderstanding between them, which, in the end, without parting them, will only make them quarrel with her.\u201d It was often thus with Mme. Verdurin and her faithful. But it was evident that in her the need to preserve their friendship was more and more dominated by the requirement that this friendship should never be challenged by that which they might feel for one another. Homosexuality did not disgust her so long as it did not tamper with orthodoxy, but like the Church she preferred any sacrifice rather than a concession of orthodoxy. I was beginning to be afraid lest her irritation with myself might be due to her having heard that I had prevented Albertine from going to her that afternoon, and that she might presently set to work, if she had not already begun, upon the same task of separating her from me which her husband, in the case of Charlus, was now going to attempt with the musician. \u201cCome along, get hold of Charlus, find some excuse, there\u2019s no time to lose,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, \u201cand whatever you do, don\u2019t let him come back here until I send for you. Oh! What an evening,\u201d Mme. Verdurin went on, revealing thus the true cause of her anger. \u201cPerforming a masterpiece in front of those wooden images. I don\u2019t include the Queen of Naples, she is intelligent, she is a nice woman\u201d (which meant: \u201cShe has been kind to me\u201d). \u201cBut the others. Oh! It\u2019s enough to drive anyone mad. What can you expect, I\u2019m no longer a girl. When I was young, people told me that one must put up with boredom, I made an effort, but now, oh no, it\u2019s too much for me, I am old enough to please myself, life is too short; bore myself, listen to idiots, smile, pretend to think them intelligent. No, I can\u2019t do it. Get along, Brichot, there\u2019s no time to lose.\u201d \u201cI am going, Madame, I am going,\u201d said Brichot, as General Deltour moved away. But first of all the Professor took me aside for a moment: \u201cMoral Duty,\u201d he said, \u201cis less clearly imperative than our Ethics teach us. Whatever the Theosophical caf\u00e9s and the Kantian beer-houses may say, we are deplorably ignorant of the nature of Good. I myself who, without wishing to boast, have lectured to my pupils, in all innocence, upon the philosophy of the said Immanuel Kant, I can see no precise ruling for the case of social casuistry with which I am now confronted in that Critique of Practical Reason in which the great renegade of Protestantism platonised in the German manner for a Germany prehistorically sentimental and aulic, ringing all the changes of a Pomeranian mysticism. It is still the Symposium, but held this time at K\u00f4nigsberg, in the local style, indigestible and reeking of sauerkraut, and without any good-looking boys. It is obvious on the one hand that I cannot refuse our excellent hostess the small service that she asks of me, in a fully orthodox conformity with traditional morals. One ought to avoid, above all things, for there are few that involve one in more foolish speeches, letting oneself be lured by words. But after all, let us not hesitate to admit that if the mothers of families were entitled to vote, the Baron would run the risk of being lamentably blackballed for the Chair of Virtue. It is unfortunately with the temperament of a rake that he pursues the vocation of a pedagogue; observe that I am not speaking evil of the Baron; that good man, who can carve a joint like nobody in the world, combines with a genius for anathema treasures of goodness. He can be most amusing as a superior sort of wag, whereas with a certain one of my colleagues, an Academician, if you please, I am bored, as Xenophon would say, at a hundred drachmae to the hour. But I am afraid that he is expending upon Morel rather more than a wholesome morality enjoins, and without knowing to what extent the young penitent shews himself docile or rebellious to the special exercises which his catechist imposes upon him by way of mortification, one need not be a learned clerk to be aware that we should be erring, as the other says, on the side of clemency with regard to this Rosicrucian who seems to have come down to us from Petronius, by way of Saint-Simon, if we granted him with our eyes shut, duly signed and sealed, permission to satanise. And yet, in keeping the man occupied while Mme. Verdurin, for the sinner\u2019s good and indeed rightly tempted by such a cure of souls, proceeds \u2014 by speaking to the young fool without any concealment \u2014 to remove from him all that he loves, to deal him perhaps a fatal blow, it seems to me that I am leading him into what one might call a man-trap, and I recoil as though from a base action.\u201d This said, he did not hesitate to commit it, but, taking him by the arm, began: \u201cCome, Baron, let us go and smoke a cigarette, this young man has not yet seen all the marvels of the house.\u201d I made the excuse that I was obliged to go home. \u201cJust wait a moment,\u201d said Brichot. \u201cYou remember, you are giving me a lift, and I have not forgotten your promise.\u201d \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like me, really, to make them bring out their plate, nothing could be simpler,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cYou promised me, remember, not a word about Morel\u2019s decoration. I mean to give him the surprise of announcing it presently when people have begun to leave, although he says that it is of no importance to an artist, but that his uncle would like him to have it\u201d (I blushed, for, I thought to myself, the Verdurins would know through my grandfather what Morel\u2019s uncle was). \u201cThen you wouldn\u2019t like me to make them bring out the best pieces,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cOf course, you know them already, you have seen them a dozen times at la Raspeli\u00e8re.\u201d I dared not tell him that what might have interested me was not the mediocrity of even the most splendid plate in a middle-class household, but some specimen, were it only reproduced in a fine engraving, of Mme. Du Barry\u2019s. I was far too gravely preoccupied \u2014 even if I had not been by this revelation as to Mlle. Vinteuil\u2019s expected presence \u2014 always, in society, far too much distracted and agitated to fasten my attention upon objects that were more or less beautiful. It could have been arrested only by the appeal of some reality that addressed itself to my imagination, as might have been, this evening, a picture of that Venice of which I had thought so much during the afternoon, or some general element, common to several forms and more genuine than they, which, of its own accord, never failed to arouse in me an inward appreciation, normally lulled in slumber, the rising of which to the surface of my consciousness filled me with great joy. Well, as I emerged from the room known as the concert-room, and crossed the other drawing-rooms with Brichot and M. de Charlus, on discovering, transposed among others, certain pieces of furniture which I had seen at la Raspeli\u00e8re and to which I had paid no attention, I perceived, between the arrangement of the town house and that of the country house, a certain common air of family life, a permanent identity, and I understood what Brichot meant when he said to me with a smile: \u201cThere, look at this room, it may perhaps give you an idea of what things were like in Rue Montalivet, twenty-five years ago.\u201d From his smile, a tribute to the defunct drawing-room which he saw with his mind\u2019s eye, I understood that what Brichot, perhaps without realising it, preferred in the old room, more than the large windows, more than the gay youth of his hosts and their faithful, was that unreal part (which I myself could discern from some similarities between la Raspeli\u00e8re and Quai Conti) of which, in a drawing-room as in everything else, the external, actual part, liable to everyone\u2019s control, is but the prolongation, was that part become purely imaginary, of a colour which no longer existed save for my elderly guide, which he was incapable of making me see, that part which has detached itself from the outer world, to take refuge in our soul, to which it gives a surplus value, in which it is assimilated to its normal substance, transforming itself \u2014 houses that have been pulled down, people long dead, bowls of fruit at the suppers which we recall \u2014 into that translucent alabaster of our memories, the colour of which we are incapable of displaying, since we alone see it, which enables us to say truthfully to other people, speaking of things past, that they cannot form any idea of them, that they do not resemble anything that they have seen, while we are unable to think of them ourselves without a certain emotion, remembering that it is upon the existence of our thoughts that there depends, for a little time still, their survival, the brilliance of the lamps that have been extinguished and the fragrance of the arbours that will never bloom again. And possibly, for this reason, the drawing-room in Rue Montalivet disparaged, for Brichot, the Verdurins\u2019 present home. But on the other hand it added to this home, in the Professor\u2019s eyes, a beauty which it could not have in those of a stranger. Those pieces of the original furniture that had been transported here, and sometimes arranged in the same groups, and which I myself remembered from la Raspeli\u00e8re, introduced into the new drawing-room fragments of the old which, at certain moments, recalled it so vividly as to create a hallucination and then seemed themselves scarcely real from having evoked in the midst of the surrounding reality fragments of a vanished world which seemed to extend round about them. A sofa that had risen up from dreamland between a pair of new and thoroughly substantial armchairs, smaller chairs upholstered in pink silk, the cloth surface of a card-table raised to the dignity of a person since, like a person, it had a past, a memory, retaining in the chill and gloom of Quai Conti the tan of its roasting by the sun through the windows of Rue Montalivet (where it could tell the time of day as accurately as Mme. Verdurin herself) and through the glass doors at la Raspeli\u00e8re, where they had taken it and where it used to gaze out all day long over the flower-beds of the garden at the valley far below, until it was time for Cottard and the musician to sit down to their game; a posy of violets and pansies in pastel, the gift of a painter friend, now dead, the sole fragment that survived of a life that had vanished without leaving any trace, summarising a great talent and a long friendship, recalling his keen, gentle eyes, his shapely hand, plump and melancholy, while he was at work on it; the incoherent, charming disorder of the offerings of the faithful, which have followed the lady of the house on all her travels and have come in time to assume the fixity of a trait of character, of a line of destiny; a profusion of cut flowers, of chocolate-boxes which here as in the country systematised their growth in an identical mode of blossoming; the curious interpolation of those singular and superfluous objects which still appear to have been just taken from the box in which they were offered and remain for ever what they were at first, New Year\u2019s Day presents; all those things, in short, which one could not have isolated from the rest, but which for Brichot, an old frequenter of the Verdurin parties, had that patina, that velvety bloom of things to which, giving them a sort of profundity, an astral body has been added; all these things scattered before him, sounded in his ear like so many resonant keys which awakened cherished likenesses in his heart, confused reminiscences which, here in this drawing-room of the present day that was littered with them, cut out, defined, as on a fine day a shaft of sunlight cuts a section in the atmosphere, the furniture and carpets, and pursuing it from a cushion to a flower-stand, from a footstool to a lingering scent, from the lighting arrangements to the colour scheme, carved, evoked, spiritualised, called to life a form which might be called the ideal aspect, immanent in each of their successive homes, of the Verdurin drawing-room. \u201cWe must try,\u201d Brichot whispered in my ear, \u201cto get the Baron upon his favourite topic. He is astounding.\u201d Now on the one hand I was glad of an opportunity to try to obtain from M. de Charlus information as to the coming of Mlle. Vinteuil and her friend. On the other hand, I did not wish to leave Albertine too long by herself, not that she could (being uncertain of the moment of my return, not to mention that, at so late an hour, she could not have received a visitor or left the house herself without arousing comment) make any evil use of my absence, but simply so that she might not find it too long. And so I told Brichot and M. de Charlus that I must shortly leave them. \u201cCome with us all the same,\u201d said the Baron, whose social excitement was beginning to flag, but feeling that need to prolong, to spin out a conversation, which I had already observed in the Duchesse de Guermantes as well as in himself, and which, while distinctive of their family, extends in a more general fashion to all those people who, offering their minds no other realisation than talk, that is to say an imperfect realisation, remain unassuaged even after hours spent in one\u2019s company, and attach themselves more and more hungrily to their exhausted companion, from whom they mistakenly expect a satiety which social pleasures are incapable of giving. \u201cCome, won\u2019t you,\u201d he repeated, \u201cthis is the pleasant moment at a party, the moment when all the guests have gone, the hour of Dona Sol; let us hope that it will end less tragically. Unfortunately you are in a hurry, in a hurry probably to go and do things which you would much better leave undone. People are always in a hurry and leave at the time when they ought to be arriving. We are here like Couture\u2019s philosophers, this is the moment in which to go over the events of the evening, to make what is called in military language a criticism of the operations. We might ask Mme. Verdurin to send us in a little supper to which we should take care not to invite her, and we might request Charlie \u2014 still Hernani \u2014 to play for ourselves alone the sublime adagio. Isn\u2019t it fine, that adagio? But where is the young violinist, I would like to congratulate him, this is the moment for tender words and embraces. Admit, Brichot, that they played like gods, Morel especially. Did you notice the moment when that lock of hair came loose? Ah, then, my dear fellow, you saw nothing at all. There was an F sharp at which Enesco, Capet and Thibaut might have died of jealousy; I may have appeared calm enough, I can tell you that at such a sound my heart was so wrung that I could barely control my tears. The whole room sat breathless; Brichot, my dear fellow,\u201d cried the Baron, gripping the other\u2019s arm which he shook violently, \u201cit was sublime. Only young Charlie preserved a stony immobility, you could not even see him breathe, he looked like one of those objects of the inanimate world of which Th\u00e9odore Rousseau speaks, which make us think, but do not think themselves. And then, all of a sudden,\u201d cried M. de Charlus with enthusiasm, making a pantomime gesture, \u201cthen . . . the Lock! And all the time, the charming little country-dance of the allegro vivace. You know, that lock was the symbol of the revelation, even to the most obtuse. The Princess of Taormina, deaf until then, for there are none so deaf as those that have ears and hear not, the Princess of Taormina, confronted by the message of the miraculous lock, realised that it was music that they were playing and not poker. Oh, that was indeed a solemn moment.\u201d \u201cExcuse me, Sir, for interrupting you,\u201d I said to M. de Charlus, hoping to bring him to the subject in which I was interested, \u201cyou told me that the composer\u2019s daughter was to be present. I should have been most interested to meet her. Are you certain that she was expected?\u201d \u201cOh, that I can\u2019t say.\u201d M. de Charlus thus complied, perhaps unconsciously, with that universal rule by which people withhold information from a jealous lover, whether in order to shew an absurd \u2018comradeship,\u2019 as a point of honour, and even if they detest her, with the woman who has excited his jealousy, or out of malice towards her, because they guess that jealousy can only intensify love, or from that need to be disagreeable to other people which consists in revealing the truth to the rest of the world but concealing it from the jealous, ignorance increasing their torment, or so at least the tormentors suppose, who, in their desire to hurt other people are guided by what they themselves believe, wrongly perhaps, to be most painful. \u201cYou know,\u201d he went on, \u201cin this house they are a trifle prone to exaggerate, they are charming people, still they do like to catch celebrities of one sort or another. But you are not looking well, and you will catch cold in this damp room,\u201d he said, pushing a chair towards me. \u201cSince you have not been well, you must take care of yourself, let me go and find you your coat. No, don\u2019t go for it yourself, you will lose your way and catch cold. How careless people are; you might be an infant in arms, you want an old nurse like me to look after you.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t trouble, Baron, let me go,\u201d said Brichot, and left us immediately; not being precisely aware perhaps of the very warm affection that M. de Charlus felt for me and of the charming lapses into simplicity and devotion that alternated with his delirious crises of grandeur and persecution, he was afraid that M. de Charlus, whom Mme. Verdurin had entrusted like a prisoner to his vigilance, might simply be seeking, under the pretext of asking for my greatcoat, to return to Morel and might thus upset the Mistress\u2019s plan\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile Ski had sat down, uninvited, at the piano, and assuming \u2014 with a playful knitting of his brows, a remote gaze and a slight twist of his lips \u2014 what he imagined to be an artistic air, was insisting that Morel should play something by Bizet. \u201cWhat, you don\u2019t like it, that boyish music of Bizet. Why, my dear fellow,\u201d he said, with that rolling of the letter r which was one of his peculiarities, \u201cit\u2019s rravishing.\u201d Morel, who did not like Bizet, said so in exaggerated terms and (as he had the reputation in the little clan of being, though it seems incredible, a wit) Ski, pretending to take the violinist\u2019s diatribes as paradoxes, burst out laughing. His laugh was not, like M. Verdurin\u2019s, the stifled gasp of a smoker. Ski first of all assumed a subtle air, then allowed to escape, as though against his will, a single note of laughter, like the first clang from a belfry, followed by a silence in which the subtle gaze seemed to be making a competent examination of the absurdity of what had been said, then a second peal of laughter shook the air, followed presently by a merry angelus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I expressed to M. de Charlus my regret that M. Brichot should be taking so much trouble. \u201cNot at all, he is delighted, he is very fond of you, everyone is fond of you. Somebody was saying only the other day: \u2018We never see him now, he is isolating himself!\u2019 Besides, he is such a good fellow, is Brichot,\u201d M. de Charlus went on, never suspecting probably, in view of the affectionate, frank manner in which the Professor of Moral Philosophy conversed with him, that he had no hesitation is slandering him behind his back. \u201cHe is a man of great merit, immensely learned, and not a bit spoiled, his learning hasn\u2019t turned him into a bookworm, like so many of them who smell of ink. He has retained a breadth of outlook, a tolerance, rare in his kind. Sometimes, when one sees how well he understands life, with what a natural grace he renders everyone his due, one asks oneself where a humble little Sorbonne professor, an ex-schoolmaster, can have picked up such breeding. I am astonished at it myself.\u201d I was even more astonished when I saw the conversation of this Brichot, which the least refined of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s friends would have found so dull, so heavy, please the most critical of them all, M. de Charlus. But to achieve this result there had collaborated, among other influences, themselves distinct also, those by virtue of which Swann, on the one hand, had so long found favour with the little clan, when he was in love with Odette, and on the other hand, after he married, found an attraction in Mme. Bontemps who, pretending to adore the Swann couple, came incessantly to call upon the wife and revelled in all the stories about the husband. Just as a writer gives the palm for intelligence, not to the most intelligent man, but to the worldling who utters a bold and tolerant comment upon the passion of a man for a woman, a comment which makes the writer\u2019s bluestocking mistress agree with him in deciding that of all the people who come to her house the least stupid is after all this old beau who shews experience in the things of love, so M. de Charlus found more intelligent than the rest of his friends Brichot, who was not merely kind to Morel, but would cull from the Greek philosophers, the Latin poets, the authors of Oriental tales, appropriate texts which decorated the Baron\u2019s propensity with a strange and charming anthology. M. de Charlus had reached the age at which a Victor Hugo chooses to surround himself, above all, with Vacqueries and Meurices. He preferred to all others those men who tolerated his outlook upon life. \u201cI see a great deal of him,\u201d he went on, in a balanced, sing-song tone, allowing no movement of his lips to stir his grave, powdered mask over which were purposely lowered his prelatical eyelids. \u201cI attend his lectures, that atmosphere of the Latin Quarter refreshes me, there is a studious, thoughtful adolescence of young bourgeois, more intelligent, better read than were, in a different sphere, my own contemporaries. It is a different world, which you know probably better than I, they are youngbourgeois,\u201d he said, detaching the last word to which he prefixed a string of b_s, and emphasising it from a sort of habit of elocution, corresponding itself to a taste for fine distinctions in past history, which was peculiar to him, but perhaps also from inability to resist the pleasure of giving me a flick of his insolence. This did not in any way diminish the great and affectionate pity that was inspired in me by M. de Charlus (after Mme. Verdurin had revealed her plan in my hearing), it merely amused me, and indeed on any other occasion, when I should not have felt so kindly disposed towards him, would not have offended me. I derived from my grandmother such an absence of any self-importance that I might easily be found wanting in dignity. Doubtless, I was scarcely aware of this, and by dint of having seen and heard, from my schooldays onwards, my most esteemed companions take offence if anyone failed to keep an appointment, refuse to overlook any disloyal behaviour, I had come in time to exhibit in my speech and actions a second nature which was stamped with pride. I was indeed considered extremely proud, because, as I had never been timid, I had been easily led into duels, the moral prestige of which, however, I diminished by making little of them, which easily persuaded other people that they were absurd; but the true nature which we trample underfoot continues nevertheless to abide within us. Thus it is that at times, if we read the latest masterpiece of a man of genius, we are delighted to find in it all those of our own reflexions which we have always despised, joys and sorrows which we have repressed, a whole world of feelings scorned by us, the value of which the book in which we discover them afresh at once teaches us. I had come in time to learn from my experience of life that it was a mistake to smile a friendly smile when somebody made a fool of me, instead of feeling annoyed. But this want of self-importance and resentment, if I had so far ceased to express it as to have become almost entirely unaware that it existed in me, was nevertheless the primitive, vital element in which I was steeped. Anger and spite came to me only in a wholly different manner, in furious crises. What was more, the sense of justice was so far lacking in me as to amount to an entire want of moral sense. I was in my heart of hearts entirely won over to the side of the weaker party, and of anyone who was in trouble. I had no opinion as to the proportion in which good and evil might be blended in the relations between Morel and M. de Charlus, but the thought of the sufferings that were being prepared for M. de Charlus was intolerable to me. I would have liked to warn him, but did not know how to do it. \u201cThe spectacle of all that laborious little world is very pleasant to an old stick like myself. I do not know them,\u201d he went on, raising his hand with an air of reserve \u2014 so as not to appear to be boasting of his own conquests, to testify to his own purity and not to allow any suspicion to rest upon that of the students \u2014\u201cbut they are most civil, they often go so far as to keep a place for me, since I am a very old gentleman. Yes indeed, my dear boy, do not protest, I am past forty,\u201d said the Baron, who was past sixty. \u201cIt is a trifle stuffy in the hall in which Brichot lectures, but it is always interesting.\u201d Albeit the Baron preferred to mingle with the youth of the schools, in other words to be jostled by them, sometimes, to save him a long wait in the lecture-room, Brichot took him in by his own door. Brichot might well be at home in the Sorbonne, at the moment when the janitor, loaded with chains of office, stepped out before him, and the master admired by his young pupils followed, he could not repress a certain timidity, and much as he desired to profit by that moment in which he felt himself so important to shew consideration for Charlus, he was nevertheless slightly embarrassed; so that the janitor should allow him to pass, he said to him, in an artificial tone and with a preoccupied air: \u201cFollow me, Baron, they\u2019ll find a place for you,\u201d then, without paying any more attention to him, to make his own entry, he advanced by himself briskly along the corridor. On either side, a double hedge of young lecturers greeted him; Brichot, anxious not to appear to be posing in the eyes of these young men to whom he knew that he was a great pontiff, bestowed on them a thousand glances, a thousand little nods of connivance, to which his desire to remain martial, thoroughly French, gave the effect of a sort of cordial encouragement by an old soldier saying: \u201cDamn it all, we can face the foe.\u201d Then the applause of his pupils broke out. Brichot sometimes extracted from this attendance by M. de Charlus at his lectures an opportunity for giving pleasure, almost for returning hospitality. He would say to some parent, or to one of his middle-class friends: \u201cIf it would interest your wife or daughter, I may tell you that the Baron de Charlus, Prince de Carency, a scion of the House of Cond\u00e9, attends my lectures. It is something to remember, having seen one of the last descendants of our aristocracy who preserves the type. If they care to come, they will know him because he will be sitting next to my chair. Besides he will be alone there, a stout man, with white hair and black moustaches, wearing the military medal.\u201d \u201cOh, thank you,\u201d said the father. And, albeit his wife had other engagements, so as not to disoblige Brichot, he made her attend the lecture, while the daughter, troubled by the heat and the crowd, nevertheless devoured eagerly with her eyes the descendant of Cond\u00e9, marvelling all the same that he was not crowned with strawberry-leaves and looked just like anybody else of the present day. He meanwhile had no eyes for her, but more than one student, who did not know who he was, was amazed at his friendly glances, became self-conscious and stiff, and the Baron left the room full of dreams and melancholy. \u201cForgive me if I return to the subject,\u201d I said quickly to M. de Charlus, for I could hear Brichot returning, \u201cbut could you let me know by wire if you should hear that Mlle. Vinteuil or her friend is expected in Paris, letting me know exactly how long they will be staying and without telling anybody that I asked you.\u201d I had almost ceased to believe that she had been expected, but I wished to guard myself thus for the future. \u201cYes, I will do that for you, first of all because I owe you a great debt of gratitude. By not accepting what, long ago, I had offered you, you rendered me, to your own loss, an immense service, you left me my liberty. It is true that I have abdicated it in another fashion,\u201d he added in a melancholy tone beneath which was visible a desire to take me into his confidence; \u201cthat is what I continue to regard as the important fact, a whole combination of circumstances which you failed to turn to your own account, possibly because fate warned you at that precise minute not to cross my Path. For always man proposes and God disposes. Who knows whether if, on the day when we came away together from Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, you had accepted, perhaps many things that have since happened would never have occurred?\u201d In some embarrassment, I turned the conversation, seizing hold of the name of Mme. de Villeparisis, and sought to find out from him, so admirably qualified in every respect, for what reasons Mme. de Villeparisis seemed to be held aloof by the aristocratic world. Not only did he not give me the solution of this little social problem, he did not even appear to me to be aware of its existence. I then realised that the position of Mme. de Villeparisis, if it was in later years to appear great to posterity, and even in the Marquise\u2019s lifetime to the ignorant rich, had appeared no less great at the opposite extremity of society, that which touched Mme. de Villeparisis, that of the Guermantes. She was their aunt; they saw first and foremost birth, connexions by marriage, the opportunity of impressing some sister-in-law with the importance of their own family. They regarded this less from the social than from the family point of view. Now this was more brilliant in the case of Mme. de Villeparisis than I had supposed. I had been impressed when I heard that the title Villeparisis was falsely assumed. But there are other examples of great ladies who have made degrading marriages and preserved a predominant position. M. de Charlus began by informing me that Mme. de Villeparisis was a niece of the famous Duchesse de \u2014\u2014-, the most celebrated member of the great aristocracy during the July Monarchy, albeit she had refused to associate with the Citizen King and his family. I had so longed to hear stories about this Duchess! And Mme. de Villeparisis, the kind Mme. de Villeparisis, with those cheeks that to me had been the cheeks of an ordinary woman, Mme. de Villeparisis who sent me so many presents and whom I could so easily have seen every day, Mme. de Villeparisis was her niece brought up by her, in her home, at the H\u00f4tel de \u2014\u2014-. \u201cShe asked the Duc de Doudeauville,\u201d M. de Charlus told me, \u201cspeaking of the three sisters, \u2018Which of the sisters do you prefer?\u2019 And when Doudeauville said: \u2018Madame de Villeparisis,\u2019 the Duchesse de \u2014\u2014\u2014 replied \u2018Pig!\u2019 For the Duchess was extremely witty,\u201d said M. de Charlus, giving the word the importance and the special pronunciation in use among the Guermantes. That he should have thought the expression so \u2018witty\u2019 did not, however, surprise me, for I had on many other occasions remarked the centrifugal, objective tendency which leads men to abdicate, when they are relishing the wit of others, the severity with which they would criticise their own, and to observe, to record faithfully, what they would have scorned to create. \u201cBut what on earth is he doing, that is my greatcoat he is bringing,\u201d he said, on seeing that Brichot had made so long a search to no better result. \u201cI would have done better to go for it myself. However, you can put it on now. Are you aware that it is highly compromising, my dear boy, it is like drinking out of the same glass, I shall be able to read your thoughts. No, not like that, come, let me do it,\u201d and as he put me into his greatcoat, he pressed it down on my shoulders, fastened it round my throat, and brushed my chin with his hand, making the apology: \u201cAt his age, he doesn\u2019t know how to put on a coat, one has to titivate him, I have missed my vocation, Brichot, I was born to be a nursery-maid.\u201d I wanted to go home, but as M. de Charlus had expressed his intention of going in search of Morel, Brichot detained us both. Moreover, the certainty that when I went home I should find Albertine there, a certainty as absolute as that which I had felt in the afternoon that Albertine would return home from the Trocad\u00e9ro, made me at this moment as little impatient to see her as I had been then when I was sitting at the piano, after Fran\u00e7oise had sent me her telephone message. And it was this calm that enabled me, whenever, in the course of this conversation, I attempted to rise, to obey Brichot\u2019s injunctions who was afraid that my departure might prevent Charlus from remaining with him until the moment when Mme. Verdurin was to come and fetch us. \u201cCome,\u201d he said to the Baron, \u201cstay a little here with us, you shall give him the accolade presently,\u201d Brichot added, fastening upon myself his almost sightless eyes to which the many operations that he had undergone had restored some degree of life, but which had not all the same the mobility necessary to the sidelong expression of malice. \u201cThe accolade, how absurd!\u201d cried the Baron, in a shrill and rapturous tone. \u201cMy boy, I tell you, he imagines he is at a prize-giving, he is dreaming of his young pupils. I ask myself whether he don\u2019t sleep with them.\u201d \u201cYou wish to meet Mlle. Vinteuil,\u201d said Brichot, who had overheard the last words of our conversation. \u201cI promise to let you know if she comes, I shall hear of it from Mme. Verdurin,\u201d for he doubtless foresaw that the Baron was in peril of an immediate exclusion from the little clan. \u201cI see, so you think that I have less claim than yourself upon Mme. Verdurin,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cto be informed of the coming of these terribly disreputable persons. You know that they are quite notorious. Mme. Verdurin is wrong to allow them to come here, they are all very well for the fast set. They are friends with a terrible band of women. They meet in the most appalling places.\u201d At each of these words, my suffering was increased by the addition of a fresh suffering, changing in form. \u201cCertainly not, I don\u2019t suppose that I have any better claim than yourself upon Mme. Verdurin,\u201d Brichot protested, punctuating his words, for he was afraid that he might have aroused the Baron\u2019s suspicions. And as he saw that I was determined to go, seeking to detain me with the bait of the promised entertainment: \u201cThere is one thing which the Baron seems to me not to have taken into account when he speaks of the reputation of these two ladies, namely that a person\u2019s reputation may be at the same time appalling and undeserved. Thus for instance, in the more notorious group which I shall call parallel, it is certain that the errors of justice are many and that history has registered convictions for sodomy against illustrious men who were wholly innocent of the charge. The recent discovery of Michelangelo\u2019s passionate love for a woman is a fresh fact which should entitle the friend of Leo X to the benefit of a posthumous retrial. The Michelangelo case seems to me clearly indicated to excite the snobs and mobilise the Villette, when another case in which anarchism reared its head and became the fashionable sin of our worthy dilettantes, but which must not even be mentioned now for fear of stirring up quarrels, shall have run its course.\u201d From the moment when Brichot began to speak of masculine reputations, M. de Charlus betrayed on every one of his features that special sort of impatience which one sees on the face of a medical or military expert when society people who know nothing about the subject begin to talk nonsense about points of therapeutics or strategy. \u201cYou know absolutely nothing about the matter,\u201d he said at length to Brichot. \u201cQuote me a single reputation that is undeserved. Mention names. Oh yes, I know the whole story,\u201d was his brutal retort to a timid interruption by Brichot, \u201cthe people who tried it once long ago out of curiosity, or out of affection for a dead friend, and the man who, afraid he has gone too far, if you speak to him of the beauty of a man, replies that that is Chinese to him, that he can no more distinguish between a beautiful man and an ugly one than between the engines of two motorcars, mechanics not being in his line. That\u2019s all stuff and nonsense. Mind you, I don\u2019t mean to say that a bad (or what is conventionally so called) and yet undeserved reputation is absolutely impossible. It is so exceptional, so rare, that for practical purposes it does not exist. At the same time I, who have a certain curiosity in ferreting things out, have known cases which were not mythical. Yes, in the course of my life, I have established (scientifically speaking, of course, you mustn\u2019t take me too literally) two unjustified reputations. They generally arise from a similarity of names, or from certain outward signs, a profusion of rings, for instance, which persons who are not qualified to judge imagine to be characteristic of what you were mentioning, just as they think that a peasant never utters a sentence without adding: \u2018Jarnigni\u00e9,\u2019 or an Englishman: \u2018Goddam.\u2019 Dialogue for the boulevard theatres. What will surprise you is that the unjustified are those most firmly established in the eyes of the public. You yourself, Brichot, who would thrust your hand in the flames to answer for the virtue of some man or other who comes to this house and whom the enlightened know to be a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, you feel obliged to believe like every Tom, Dick and Harry in what is said about some man in the public eye who is the incarnation of those propensities to the common herd, when as a matter of fact, he doesn\u2019t care twopence for that sort of thing. I say twopence, because if we were to offer five-and-twenty louis, we should see the number of plaster saints dwindle down to nothing. As things are, the average rate of sanctity, if you see any sanctity in that sort of thing, is somewhere between thirty and forty per cent.\u201d If Brichot had transferred to the male sex the question of evil reputations, with me it was, inversely, to the female sex that, thinking of Albertine, I applied the Baron\u2019s words. I was appalled at his statistics, even when I bore in mind that he was probably enlarging his figures to reach the total that he would like to believe true, and had based them moreover upon the reports of persons who were scandalmongers and possibly liars, and had in any case been led astray by their own desire, which, coming in addition to that of M. de Charlus, doubtless falsified the Baron\u2019s calculations. \u201cThirty per cent!\u201d exclaimed Brichot. \u201cWhy, even if the proportions were reversed I should still have to multiply the guilty a hundredfold. If it is as you say, Baron, and you are not mistaken, then we must confess that you are one of those rare visionaries who discern a truth which nobody round them has ever suspected. Just as Barr\u00e9s made discoveries as to parliamentary corruption, the truth of which was afterwards established, like the existence of Leverrier\u2019s planet. Mme. Verdurin would prefer to cite men whom I would rather not name who detected in the Intelligence Bureau, in the General Staff, activities inspired, I am sure, by patriotic zeal, which I had never imagined. Upon free-masonry, German espionage, morphinomania, L\u00e9on Daudet builds up, day by day, a fantastic fairy-tale which turns out to be the barest truth. Thirty per cent!\u201d Brichot repeated in stupefaction. It is only fair to say that M. de Charlus taxed the great majority of his contemporaries with inversion, always excepting those men with whom he himself had had relations, their case, provided that they had introduced the least trace of romance into those relations, appearing to him more complex. So it is that we see men of the world, who refuse to believe in women\u2019s honour, allow some remnants of honour only to the woman who has been their mistress, as to whom they protest sincerely and with an air of mystery: \u201cNo, you are mistaken, she is not that sort of girl.\u201d This unlooked-for tribute is dictated partly by their own self-respect which is flattered by the supposition that such favours have been reserved for them alone, partly by their simplicity which has easily swallowed everything that their mistress has given them to believe, partly from that sense of the complexity of life which brings it about that, as soon as we approach other people, other lives, ready-made labels and classifications appear unduly crude. \u201cThirty per cent! But have a care; less fortunate than the historians whose conclusions the future will justify, Baron, if you were to present to posterity the statistics that you offer us, it might find them erroneous. Posterity judges only from documentary evidence, and will insist on being assured of your facts. But as no document would be forthcoming to authenticate this sort of collective phenomena which the few persons who are enlightened are only too ready to leave in obscurity, the best minds would be moved to indignation, and you would be regarded as nothing more than a slanderer or a lunatic. After having, in the social examination, obtained top marks and the primacy upon this earth, you would taste the sorrows of a blackball beyond the grave. That is not worth powder and shot, to quote \u2014 may God forgive me \u2014 our friend Bossuet.\u201d \u201cI am not interested in history,\u201d replied M. de Charlus, \u201cthis life is sufficient for me, it is quite interesting enough, as poor Swann used to say.\u201d \u201cWhat, you knew Swann, Baron, I was not aware of that. Tell me, was he that way inclined?\u201d Brichot inquired with an air of misgiving!\u201cWhat a mind the man has! So you suppose that I only know men like that. No, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Charlus, looking to the ground and trying to weigh the pros and cons. And deciding that, since he was dealing with Swann whose hostility to that sort of thing had always been notorious, a half-admission could only be harmless to him who was its object and flattering to him who allowed it to escape in an insinuation: \u201cI don\u2019t deny that long ago in our schooldays, once by accident,\u201d said the Baron, as though unwillingly and as though he were thinking aloud, then recovering himself: \u201cBut that was centuries ago, how do you expect me to remember, you are making a fool of me,\u201d he concluded with a laugh. \u201cIn any case, he was never what you\u2019d call a beauty!\u201d said Brichot who, himself hideous, thought himself good-looking and was always ready to believe that other men were ugly. \u201cHold your tongue,\u201d said the Baron, \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about, in those days he had a peach-like complexion, and,\u201d he added, finding a fresh note for each syllable, \u201che was as beautiful as Cupid himself. Besides he was always charming. The women were madly in love with him.\u201d \u201cBut did you ever know his wife?\u201d \u201cWhy, it was through me that he came to know her. I thought her charming in her disguise one evening when she played Miss Sacripant; I was with some fellows from the club, each of us took a woman home with him, and, although all that I wanted was to go to sleep, slanderous tongues alleged, for it is terrible how malicious people are, that I went to bed with Odette. Only she took advantage of the slanders to come and worry me, and I thought I might get rid of her by introducing her to Swann. From that moment she never let me go, she couldn\u2019t spell the simplest word, it was I who wrote all her letters for her. And it was I who, afterwards, had to take her out. That, my boy, is what comes of having a good reputation, you see. Though I only half deserved it. She forced me to help her to betray him, with five, with six other men.\u201d And the lovers whom Odette had had in succession (she had been with this man, then with that, those men not one of whose names had ever been guessed by poor Swann, blinded in turn by jealousy and by love, reckoning the chances and believing in oaths more affirmative than a contradiction which escapes from the culprit, a contradiction far more unseizable, and at the same time far more significant, of which the jealous lover might take advantage more logically than of the information which he falsely pretends to have received, in the hope of confusing his mistress), these lovers M. de Charlus began to enumerate with as absolute a certainty as if he had been repeating the list of the Kings of France. And indeed the jealous lover is, like the contemporaries of an historical event, too close, he knows nothing, and it is in the eyes of strangers that the comic aspect of adultery assumes the precision of history, and prolongs itself in lists of names which are, for that matter, unimportant and become painful only to another jealous lover, such as myself, who cannot help comparing his own case with that which he hears mentioned and asks himself whether the woman of whom he is suspicious cannot boast an equally illustrious list. But he can never know anything more, it is a sort of universal conspiracy, a \u2018blindman\u2019s buff\u2019 in which everyone cruelly participates, and which consists, while his mistress flits from one to another, in holding over his eyes a bandage which he is perpetually attempting to tear off without success, for everyone keeps him blindfold, poor wretch, the kind out of kindness, the wicked out of malice, the coarse-minded out of their love of coarse jokes, the well-bred out of politeness and good-breeding, and all alike respecting one of those conventions which are called principles. \u201cBut did Swann never know that you had enjoyed her favours?\u201d \u201cWhat an idea! If you had suggested such a thing to Charles! It\u2019s enough to make one\u2019s hair stand up on end. Why, my dear fellow, he would have killed me on the spot, he was as jealous as a tiger. Any more than I ever confessed to Odette, not that she would have minded in the least, that . . . but you must not make my tongue run away with me. And the joke of it is that it was she who fired a revolver at him, and nearly hit me. Oh! I used to have a fine time with that couple; and naturally it was I who was obliged to act as his second against d\u2019Osmond, who never forgave me. D\u2019Osmond had carried off Odette and Swann, to console himself, had taken as his mistress, or make-believe mistress, Odette\u2019s sister. But really you must not begin to make me tell you Swann\u2019s story, we should be here for ten years, don\u2019t you know, nobody knows more about him than I do. It was I who used to take Odette out when she did not wish to see Charles. It was all the more awkward for me as I have a quite near relative who bears the name Cr\u00e9cy, without of course having any manner of right to it, but still he was none too well pleased. For she went by the name of Odette de Cr\u00e9cy, as she very well might, being merely separated from a Cr\u00e9cy whose wife she still was, and quite an authentic person, a highly respectable gentleman out of whom she had drained his last farthing. But why should I have to tell you about this Cr\u00e9cy, I have seen you with him on the crawler, you used to have him to dinner at Balbec. He must have needed those dinners, poor fellow, he lived upon a tiny allowance that Swann made him; I am greatly afraid that, since my friend\u2019s death, that income must have stopped altogether. What I do not understand,\u201d M. de Charlus said to me, \u201cis that, since you used often to go to Charles\u2019s, you did not ask me this evening to present you to the Queen of Naples. In fact I can see that you are less interested in people than in curiosities, and that continues to surprise me in a person who knew Swann, in whom that sort of interest was so far developed that it is impossible to say whether it was I who initiated him in these matters or he myself. It surprises me as much as if I met a person who had known Whistler and remained ignorant of what is meant by taste. By Jove, it is Morel that ought really to have been presented to her, he was passionately keen on it too, for he is the most intelligent fellow you could imagine. It is a nuisance that she has left. However, I shall effect the conjunction one of these days. It is indispensable that he should know her. The only possible obstacle would be if she were to die in the night. Well, we may hope that it will not happen.\u201d All of a sudden Brichot, who was still suffering from the shock of the proportion \u2018thirty per cent\u2019 which M. de Charlus had revealed to him, Brichot who had continued all this time in the pursuit of his idea, with an abruptness which suggested that of an examining magistrate seeking to make a prisoner confess, but which was in reality the result of the Professor\u2019s desire to appear perspicacious and of the misgivings that he felt about launching so grave an accusation, spoke. \u201cIsn\u2019t Ski like that?\u201d he inquired of M. de Charlus with a sombre air. To make us admire his alleged power of intuition, he had chosen Ski, telling himself that since there were only three innocent men in every ten, he ran little risk of being mistaken if he named Ski who seemed to him a trifle odd, suffered from insomnia, scented himself, in short was not entirely normal. \u201cNothing of the sort!\u201d exclaimed the Baron with a bitter, dogmatic, exasperated irony. \u201cWhat you say is utterly false, absurd, fantastic. Ski is like that precisely to the people who know nothing about it; if he was, he would not look so like it, be it said without any intention to criticise, for he has a certain charm, indeed I find something very attractive about him.\u201d \u201cBut give us a few names, then,\u201d Brichot pursued with insistence. M. de Charlus drew himself up with a forbidding air. \u201cAh! my dear Sir, I, as you know, live in a world of abstraction, all that sort of thing interests me only from a transcendental point of view,\u201d he replied with the touchy susceptibility peculiar to men of his kind, and the affectation of grandiloquence that characterised his conversation. \u201cTo me, you understand, it is only general principles that are of any interest, I speak to you of this as I might of the law of gravitation.\u201d But these moments of irritable reaction in which the Baron sought to conceal his true life lasted but a short time compared with the hours of continual progression in which he allowed it to be guessed, displayed it with an irritating complacency, the need to confide being stronger in him than the fear of divulging his secret. \u201cWhat I was trying to say,\u201d he went on, \u201cis that for one evil reputation that is unjustified there are hundreds of good ones which are no less so. Obviously, the number of those who do not merit their reputations varies according to whether you rely upon what is said by men of their sort or by the others. And it is true that if the malevolence of the latter is limited by the extreme difficulty which they would find in believing that a vice as horrible to them as robbery or murder is being practised by men whom they know to be sensitive and sincere, the malevolence of the former is stimulated to excess by the desire to regard as \u2014 what shall I say? \u2014 accessible, men who appeal to them, upon the strength of information given them by people who have been led astray by a similar desire, in fact by the very aloofness with which they are generally regarded. I have heard a man, viewed with considerable disfavour on account of these tastes, say that he supposed that a certain man in society shared them. And his sole reason for believing it was that this other man had been polite to him! So many reasons for optimism,\u201d said the Baron artlessly, \u201cin the computation of the number. But the true reason of the enormous difference that exists between the number calculated by the profane, and that calculated by the initiated, arises from the mystery with which the latter surround their actions, in order to conceal them from the rest, who, lacking any source of information, would be literally stupefied if they were to learn merely a quarter of the truth.\u201d \u201cThen in our days, things are as they were among the Greeks,\u201d said Brichot. \u201cWhat do you mean, among the Greeks? Do you suppose that it has not been going on ever since? Take the reign of Louis XIV, you have young Vermandois, Moli\u00e8re, Prince Louis of Baden, Brunswick, Charolais, Boufflers, the Great Cond\u00e9, the Duc de Brissac.\u201d \u201cStop a moment, I knew about Monsieur, I knew about Brissac from Saint-Simon, Vend\u00f4me of course, and many, others as well. But that old pest Saint-Simon often refers to the Great Cond\u00e9 and Prince Louis of Baden and never mentions it.\u201d \u201cIt seems a pity, I must say, that it should fall to me to teach a Professor of the Sorbonne his history. But, my dear Master, you are as ignorant as a carp.\u201d \u201cYou are harsh, Baron, but just. And, wait a moment, now this will please you, I remember now a song of the period composed in macaronic verse about a certain storm which surprised the Great Cond\u00e9 as he was going down the Rh\u00f4ne in the company of his friend, the Marquis de La Moussaye.

However, at that period, I suppose that generally speaking the art of war. . . . \u201d \u201cWhat nonsense, Vend\u00f4me, Villars, Prince Eug\u00e8ne, the Prince de Conti, and if I were to tell you of all the heroes of Tonkin, Morocco, and I am thinking of men who are truly sublime, and pious, and \u2018new generation,\u2019 I should astonish you greatly. Ah! I should have something to teach the people who are making inquiries about the new generation which has rejected the futile complications of its elders, M. Bourget tells us! I have a young friend out there, who is highly spoken of, who has done great things, however, I am not going to tell tales out of school, let us return to the seventeenth century, you know that Saint-Simon says of the Mar\u00e9chal d\u2019Huxelles \u2014 one among many: \u2018Voluptuous in Grecian debaucheries which he made no attempt to conceal, he used to get hold of young officers whom he trained to his purpose, not to mention stalwart young valets, and this openly, in the army and at Strasbourg.\u2019 You have probably read Madame\u2019s Letters, all his men called him \u2018Putain.\u2019 She is quite outspoken about it.\u201d \u201cAnd she was in a good position to know, with her husband.\u201d \u201cSuch an interesting character, Madame,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cOne might base upon her the lyrical synthesis of \u2018Wives of Aunties.\u2019 First of all, the masculine type; generally the wife of an Auntie is a man, that is what makes it so easy for her to bear him children. Then Madame does not mention Monsieur\u2019s vices, but she does mention incessantly the same vice in other men, writing as a well-informed woman, from that tendency which makes us enjoy finding in other people\u2019s families the same defects as afflict us in our own, in order to prove to ourselves that there is nothing exceptional or degrading in them. I was saying that things have been much the same in every age. Nevertheless, our own is quite remarkable in that respect. And notwithstanding the instances that I have borrowed from the seventeenth century, if my great ancestor Fran\u00e7ois C. de La Rochefoucauld were alive in these days, he might say of them with even more justification than of his own \u2014 come, Brichot, help me out: \u2018Vices are common to every age; but if certain persons whom everyone knows had appeared in the first centuries of our era, would anyone speak to-day of the prostitutions of Heliogabalus?\u2019 \u2018Whom everyone knows\u2019 appeals to me immensely. I see that my sagacious kinsman understood the tricks of his most illustrious contemporaries as I understand those of my own. But men of that sort are not only far more frequent to-day. They have also special characteristics.\u201d I could see that M. de Charlus was about to tell us in what fashion these habits had evolved. The insistence with which M. de Charlus kept on reverting to this topic \u2014 into which, moreover, his intellect, constantly trained in the same direction, had acquired a certain penetration \u2014 was, in a complicated way, distinctly trying. He was as boring as a specialist who can see nothing outside his own subject, as irritating as a well-informed man whose vanity is flattered by the secrets which he possesses and is burning to divulge, as repellent as those people who, whenever their own defects are mentioned, spread themselves without noticing that they are giving offence, as obsessed as a maniac and as uncontrollably imprudent as a criminal. These characteristics which, at certain moments, became as obvious as those that stamp a madman or a criminal, brought me, as it happened, a certain consolation. For, making them undergo the necessary transposition in order to be able to draw from them deductions with regard to Albertine, and remembering her attitude towards Saint-Loup, and towards myself, I said to myself, painful as one of these memories and melancholy as the other was to me, I said to myself that they seemed to exclude the kind of deformity so plainly denounced, the kind of specialisation inevitably exclusive, it appeared, which was so vehemently apparent in the conversation as in the person of M. de Charlus. But he, as ill luck would have it, made haste to destroy these grounds for hope in the same way as he had furnished me with them, that is to say unconsciously. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cI am no longer in my teens, and I have already seen many things change round about me, I no longer recognise either society, in which the barriers are broken down, in which a mob, devoid of elegance and decency, dance the tango even in my own family, or fashions, or politics, or the arts, or religion, or anything. But I must admit that the thing which has changed most of all is what the Germans call homosexuality. Good God, in my day, apart from the men who loathed women, and those who, caring only for women, did the other thing merely with an eye to profit, the homosexuals were sound family men and never kept mistresses except to screen themselves. If I had had a daughter to give away, it is among them that I should have looked for my son-in-law if I had wished to be certain that she would not be unhappy. Alas! Things have changed entirely. Nowadays they are recruited also from the men who are the most insatiable with women. I thought I possessed a certain instinct, and that when I said to myself: \u2018Certainly not,\u2019 I could not have been mistaken. Well, I give it up. One of my friends, who is well-known for that sort of thing, bad a coachman whom my sister-in-law Oriane found for him, a lad from Combray who was something of a jack of all trades, but particularly in trading with women, and who, I would have sworn, was as hostile as possible to anything of that sort. He broke his mistress\u2019s heart by betraying her with two women whom he adored, not to mention the others, an actress and a girl from a bar. My cousin the Prince de Guermantes, who has that irritating intelligence of people who are too ready to believe anything, said to me one day: \u2018But why in the world does not X\u2014\u2014-have his coachman? It might be a pleasure to Th\u00e9odore\u2019 (which is the coachman\u2019s name) \u2018and he may be annoyed at finding that his master does not make advances to him.\u2019 I could not help telling Gilbert to hold his tongue; I was overwrought both by that boasted perspicacity which, when it is exercised indiscriminately, is a want of perspicacity, and also by the s\u00eelver-lined malice of my cousin who would have liked X\u2014\u2014-to risk taking the first steps so that, if the going was good, he might follow.\u201d \u201cThen the Prince de Guermantes is like that, too?\u201d asked Brichot with a blend of astonishment and dismay. \u201cGood God,\u201d replied M. de Charlus, highly delighted, \u201cit is so notorious that I don\u2019t think I am guilty of an indiscretion if I tell you that he is. Very well, the year after this, I went to Balbec, where I heard from a sailor who used to take me out fishing occasionally, that my Th\u00e9odore, whose sister, I may mention, is the maid of a friend of Mme. Verdurin, Baroness Putbus, used to come down to the harbour to pick up now one sailor, now another, with the most infernal cheek, to go for a trip on the sea \u2018with extras.\u2019\u201d It was now my turn to inquire whether his employer, whom I had identified as the gentleman who at Balbec used to play cards all day long with his mistress, and who was the leader of the little group of four boon companions, was like the Prince of Guermantes. \u201cWhy, of course, everyone knows about him, he makes no attempt to conceal it.\u201d \u201cBut he had his mistress there with him.\u201d \u201cWell, and what difference does that make? How innocent these children are,\u201d he said to me in a fatherly tone, little suspecting the grief that I extracted from his words when I thought of Albertine. \u201cShe is charming, his mistress.\u201d \u201cBut then his three friends are like himself.\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d he cried, stopping his ears as though, in playing some instrument, I had struck a wrong note. \u201cNow he has gone to the other extreme. So a man has no longer the right to have friends? Ah! Youth, youth; it gets everything wrong. We shall have to begin your education over again, my boy. Well,\u201d he went on, \u201cI admit that this case, and I know of many others, however open a mind I may try to keep for every form of audacity, does embarrass me. I may be very old-fashioned, but I fail to understand,\u201d he said in the tone of an old Gallican speaking of some development of Ultramontanism, of a Liberal Royalist speaking of the Action Fran\u00e7aise or of a disciple of Claude Monet speaking of the Cubists. \u201cI do not reproach these innovators, I envy them if anything, I try to understand them, but I do not succeed. If they are so passionately fond of woman, why, and especially in this workaday world where that sort of thing is so frowned upon, where they conceal themselves from a sense of shame, have they any need of what they call \u2018a bit of brown\u2019? It is because it represents to them something else. What?\u201d \u201cWhat else can a woman represent to Albertine,\u201d I thought, and there indeed lay the cause of my anguish. \u201cDecidedly, Baron,\u201d said Brichot, \u201cshould the Board of Studies ever think of founding a Chair of Homosexuality, I shall see that your name is the first to be submitted. Or rather, no; an Institute of Psycho-physiology would suit you better. And I can see you, best of all, provided with a Chair in the Coll\u00e8ge de France, which would enable you to devote yourself to personal researches the results of which you would deliver, like the Professor of Tamil or Sanskrit, to the handful of people who are interested in them. You would have an audience of two, with your assistant, not that I mean to cast the slightest suspicion upon our corps of janitors, whom I believe to be above suspicion.\u201d \u201cYou know nothing about them,\u201d the Baron retorted in a harsh and cutting tone. \u201cBesides you are wrong in thinking that so few people are interested in the subject. It is just the opposite.\u201d And without stopping to consider the incompatibility between the invariable trend of his own conversation and the reproach which he was about to heap upon other people: \u201cIt is, on the contrary, most alarming,\u201d said the Baron, with a scandalised and contrite air, \u201cpeople are talking about nothing else. It is a scandal, but I am not exaggerating, my dear fellow! It appears that, the day before yesterday, at the Duchesse d\u2019Agen\u2019s, they talked about nothing else for two hours on end; you can imagine, if women have taken to discussing that sort of thing, it is a positive scandal! What is vilest of all is that they get their information,\u201d he went on with an extraordinary fire and emphasis, \u201cfrom pests, regular harlots like young Ch\u00e2tellerault, who has the worst reputation in the world, who tell them stories about other men. I have been told that he said more than enough to hang me, but I don\u2019t care, I am convinced that the mud and filth flung by an individual who barely escaped being turned out of the Jockey for cheating at cards can only fall back upon himself. I am sure that if I were Jane d\u2019Agen, I should have sufficient respect for my drawing-room not to allow such subjects to be discussed in it, nor to allow my own flesh and blood to be dragged through the mire in my house. But there is no longer any society, any rules, any conventions, in conversation any more than in dress. Ah, my dear fellow, it is the end of the world. Everyone has become so malicious. The prize goes to the man who can speak most evil of his fellows. It is appalling.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As cowardly still as I had been long ago in my boyhood at Combray when I used to run away in order not to see my grandfather tempted with brandy and the vain efforts of my grandmother imploring him not to drink it, I had but one thought in my mind, which was to leave the Verdurins\u2019 house before the execution of M. de Charlus occurred. \u201cI simply must go,\u201d I said to Brichot. \u201cI am coming with you,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut we cannot slip away, English fashion. Come and say good-bye to Mme. Verdurin,\u201d the Professor concluded, as he made his way to the drawing-room with the air of a man who, in a guessing game, goes to find out whether he may \u2018come back.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While we conversed, M. Verdurin, at a signal from his wife, had taken Morel aside. Indeed, had Mme. Verdurin decided, after considering the matter in all its aspects, that it was wiser to postpone Morel\u2019s enlightenment, she was powerless now to prevent it. There are certain desires, some of them confined to the mouth, which, as soon as we have allowed them to grow, insist upon being gratified, whatever the consequences may be; we are unable to resist the temptation to kiss a bare shoulder at which we have been gazing for too long and at which our lips strike like a serpent at a bird, to bury our sweet tooth in a cake that has fascinated and famished it, nor can we forego the delight of the amazement, anxiety, grief or mirth to which we can move another person by some unexpected communication. So, in a frenzy of melodrama, Mme. Verdurin had ordered her husband to take Morel out of the room and, at all costs, to explain matters to him. The violinist had begun by deploring the departure of the Queen of Naples before he had had a chance of being presented to her. M. de Charlus had told him so often that she was the sister of the Empress Elisabeth and of the Duchesse d\u2019Alen\u00e7on that Her Majesty had assumed an extraordinary importance in his eyes. But the Master explained to him that it was not to talk about the Queen of Naples that they had withdrawn from the rest, and then went straight to the root of the matter. \u201cListen,\u201d he had concluded after a long explanation; \u201clisten; if you like, we can go and ask my wife what she thinks. I give you my word of honour, I\u2019ve said nothing to her about it. We shall see how she looks at it. My advice is perhaps not the best, but you know how sound her judgment is; besides, she is extremely attached to yourself, let us go and submit the case to her.\u201d And while Mme. Verdurin, awaiting with impatience the emotions that she would presently be relishing as she talked to the musician, and again, after he had gone, when she made her husband give her a full report of their conversation, continued to repeat: \u201cBut what in the world can they be doing? I do hope that my husband, in keeping him all this time, has managed to give him his cue,\u201d M. Verdurin reappeared with Morel who seemed greatly moved. \u201cHe would like to ask your advice,\u201d M. Verdurin said to his wife, in the tone of a man who does not know whether his prayer will be heard. Instead of replying to M. Verdurin, it was to Morel that, in the heat of her passion, Mme. Verdurin addressed herself. \u201cI agree entirely with my husband, I consider that you cannot tolerate this sort of thing for another instant,\u201d she exclaimed with violence, discarding as a useless fiction her agreement with her husband that she was supposed to know nothing of what he had been saying to the violinist. \u201cHow do you mean? Tolerate what?\u201d stammered M. Verdurin, endeavouring to feign astonishment and seeking, with an awkwardness that was explained by his dismay, to defend his falsehood. \u201cI guessed what you were saying to him,\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, undisturbed by the improbability of this explanation, and caring little what, when he recalled this scene, the violinist might think of the Mistress\u2019s veracity. \u201cNo,\u201d Mme. Verdurin continued, \u201cI feel that you ought not to endure any longer this degrading promiscuity with a tainted person whom nobody will have in her house,\u201d she went on, regardless of the fact that this was untrue and forgetting that she herself entertained him almost daily. \u201cYou are the talk of the Conservatoire,\u201d she added, feeling that this was the argument that carried most weight; \u201canother month of this life and your artistic future is shattered, whereas, without Charlus, you ought to be making at least a hundred thousand francs a year.\u201d \u201cBut I have never heard anyone utter a word, I am astounded, I am very grateful to you,\u201d Morel murmured, the tears starting to his eyes. But, being obliged at once to feign astonishment and to conceal his shame, he had turned redder and was perspiring more abundantly than if he had played all Beethoven\u2019s sonatas in succession, and tears welled from his eyes which the Bonn Master would certainly not have drawn from him. \u201cIf you have never heard anything, you are unique in that respect. He is a gentleman with a vile reputation and the most shocking stories are told about him. I know that the police are watching him and that is perhaps the best thing for him if he is not to end like all those men, murdered by hooligans,\u201d she went on, for as she thought of Charlus the memory of Mme. de Duras recurred to her, and in her frenzy of rage she sought to aggravate still further the wounds that she was inflicting on the unfortunate Charlie, and to avenge herself for those that she had received in the course of the evening. \u201cAnyhow, even financially, he can be of no use to you, he is completely ruined since he has become the prey of people who are blackmailing him, and who can\u2019t even make him fork out the price of the tune they call, still less can he pay you for your playing, for it is all heavily mortgaged, town house, country house, everything.\u201d Morel was all the more ready to believe this lie since M. de Charlus liked to confide in him his relations with hooligans, a race for which the son of a valet, however debauched he may be, professes a feeling of horror as strong as his attachment to Bonapartist principles\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Already, in the cunning mind of Morel, a plan was beginning to take shape similar to what was called in the eighteenth century the reversal of alliances. Determined never to speak to M. de Charlus again, he would return on the following evening to Jupien\u2019s niece, and see that everything was made straight with her. Unfortunately for him this plan was doomed to failure, M. de Charlus having made an appointment for that very evening with Jupien, which the ex-tailor dared not fail to keep, in spite of recent events. Other events, as we shall see, having followed upon Morel\u2019s action, when Jupien in tears told his tale of woe to the Baron, the latter, no less wretched, assured him that he would adopt the forsaken girl, that she should assume one of the titles that were at his disposal, probably that of Mlle. d\u2019Oloron, that he would see that she received a thorough education, and furnish her with a rich husband. Promises which filled Jupien with joy and left his niece unmoved, for she was still in love with Morel, who, from stupidity or cynicism, used to come into the shop and tease her in Jupien\u2019s absence. \u201cWhat is the matter with you,\u201d he would say with a laugh, \u201cwith those black marks under your eyes? A broken heart? Gad, the years pass and people change. After all, a man is free to try on a shoe, all the more a woman, and if she doesn\u2019t fit him. . . . \u201d He lost his temper once only, because she cried, which he considered cowardly, unworthy of her. People are not always very tolerant of the tears which they themselves have provoked\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But we have looked too far ahead, for all this did not happen until after the Verdurins\u2019 party which we have interrupted, and we must go back to the point at which we left off. \u201cI should never have suspected it,\u201d Morel groaned, in answer to Mme. Verdurin. \u201cNaturally people do not say it to your face, that does not prevent your being the talk of the Conservatoire,\u201d Mme. Verdurin went on wickedly, seeking to make it plain to Morel that it was not only M. de Charlus that was being criticised, but himself also. \u201cI can well believe that you know nothing about it; all the same, people are quite outspoken. Ask Ski what they were saying the other day at Chevillard\u2019s within a foot of us when you came into my box. I mean to say, people point you out. As far as I\u2019m concerned, I don\u2019t pay the slightest attention, but what I do feel is that it makes a man supremely ridiculous and that he becomes a public laughing-stock for the rest of his life.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you,\u201d said Charlie in the tone we use to a dentist who has just caused us terrible pain while we tried not to let him see it, or to a too bloodthirsty second who has forced us into a duel on account of some casual remark of which he has said: \u201cYou can\u2019t swallow that.\u201d \u201cI believe that you have plenty of character, that you are a man,\u201d replied Mme. Verdurin, \u201cand that you will be capable of speaking out boldly, although he tells everybody that you would never dare, that he holds you fast.\u201d Charlie, seeking a borrowed dignity in which to cloak the tatters of his own, found in his memory something that he had read or, more probably, heard quoted, and at once proclaimed: \u201cI was not brought up to eat that sort of bread. This very evening I will break with M. de Charlus. The Queen of Naples has gone, hasn\u2019t she? Otherwise, before breaking with him, I should like to ask him. . . . \u201d \u201cIt is not necessary to break with him altogether,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, anxious to avoid a disruption of the little nucleus. \u201cThere is no harm in your seeing him here, among our little group, where you are appreciated, where no one speaks any evil of you. But insist upon your freedom, and do not let him drag you about among all those sheep who are friendly to your face; I wish you could have heard what they were saying behind your back. Anyhow, you need feel no regret, not only are you wiping off a stain which would have marked you for the rest of your life, from the artistic point of view, even if there had not been this scandalous presentation by Charlus, I don\u2019t mind telling you that wasting yourself like this in this sham society will make people suppose that you aren\u2019t serious, give you an amateur reputation, as a little drawing-room performer, which is a terrible thing at your age. I can understand that to all those fine ladies it is highly convenient to be able to return their friends\u2019 hospitality by making you come and play for nothing, but it is your future as an artist that would foot the bill. I don\u2019t say that you shouldn\u2019t go to one or two of them. You were speaking of the Queen of Naples \u2014 who has left, for she had to go on to another party \u2014 now she is a splendid woman, and I don\u2019t mind saying that I think she has a poor opinion of Charlus and came here chiefly to please me. Yes, yes, I know she was longing to meet us, M. Verdurin and myself. That is a house in which you might play. And then I may tell you that if I take you \u2014 because the artists all know me, you understand, they have always been most obliging to me, and regard me almost as one of themselves, as their Mistress \u2014 that is a very different matter. But whatever you do, you must never go near Mme. de Duras! Don\u2019t go and make a stupid blunder like that! I know several artists who have come here and told me all about her. They know they can trust me,\u201d she said, in the sweet and simple tone which she knew how to adopt in an instant, imparting an appropriate air of modesty to her features, an appropriate charm to her eyes, \u201cthey come here, just like that, to tell me all their little troubles; the ones who are said to be most silent, go on chatting to me sometimes for hours on end and I can\u2019t tell you how interesting they are. Poor Chabrier used always to say: \u2018There\u2019s nobody like Mme. Verdurin for getting them to talk.\u2019 Very well, don\u2019t you know, all of them, without one exception, I have seen them in tears because they had gone to play for Mme. de Duras. It is not only the way she enjoys making her servants humiliate them, they could never get an engagement anywhere else again. The agents would say: \u2018Oh yes, the fellow who plays at Mme. de Duras\u2019s.\u2019 That settled it. There is nothing like that for ruining a man\u2019s future. You know what society people are like, it\u2019s not taken seriously, you may have all the talent in the world, it\u2019s a dreadful thing to have to say, but one Mme. de Duras is enough to give you the reputation of an amateur. And among artists, don\u2019t you know, well I, you can ask yourself whether I know them, when I have been moving among them for forty years, launching them, taking an interest in them; very well, when they say that somebody is an amateur, that finishes it. And people were beginning to say it of you. Indeed, at times I have been obliged to take up the cudgels, to assure them that you would not play in some absurd drawing-room! Do you know what the answer was: \u2018But he will be forced to go, Charlus won\u2019t even consult him, he never asks him for his opinion.\u2019 Somebody thought he would pay him a compliment and said: \u2018We greatly admire your friend Morel.\u2019 Can you guess what answer he made, with that insolent air which you know? \u2018But what do you mean by calling him my friend, we are not of the same class, say rather that he is my creature, my prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\u2019\u201d At this moment there stirred beneath the convex brows of the musical deity the one thing that certain people cannot keep to themselves, a saying which it is not merely abject but imprudent to repeat. But the need to repeat it is stronger than honour, than prudence. It was to this need that, after a few convulsive movements of her spherical and sorrowful brows, the Mistress succumbed: \u201cSome one actually told my husband that he had said \u2018my servant,\u2019 but for that I cannot vouch,\u201d she added. It was a similar need that had compelled M. de Charlus, shortly after he had sworn to Morel that nobody should ever know the story of his birth, to say to Mme. Verdurin: \u201cHis father was a flunkey.\u201d A similar need again, now that the story had been started, would make it circulate from one person to another, each of whom would confide it under the seal of a secrecy which would be promised and not kept by the hearer, as by the informant himself. These stories would end, as in the game called hunt-the-thimble, by being traced back to Mme. Verdurin, bringing down upon her the wrath of the person concerned, who would at last have learned the truth. She knew this, but could not repress the words that were burning her tongue. Anyhow, the word \u2018servant\u2019 was bound to annoy Morel. She said \u2018servant\u2019 nevertheless, and if she added that she could not vouch for the word, this was so as at once to appear certain of the rest, thanks to this hint of uncertainty, and to shew her impartiality. This impartiality that she shewed, she herself found so touching that she began to speak affectionately to Charlie: \u201cFor, don\u2019t you see,\u201d she went on, \u201cI am not blaming him, he is dragging you down into his abyss, it is true, but it is not his fault, since he wallows in it himself, since he wallows in it,\u201d she repeated in a louder tone, having been struck by the aptness of the image which had taken shape so quickly that her attention only now overtook it and was trying to give it prominence. \u201cNo, the fault that I do find with him,\u201d she said in a melting tone \u2014 like a woman drunken with her own success \u2014\u201cis a want of delicacy towards yourself. There are certain things which one does not say in public. Well, this evening, he was betting that he would make you blush with joy, by telling you (stuff and nonsense, of course, for his recommendation would be enough to prevent your getting it) that you were to have the Cross of the Legion of Honour. Even that I could overlook, although I have never quite liked,\u201d she went on with a delicate, dignified air, \u201chearing a person make a fool of his friends, but, don\u2019t you know, there are certain little things that one does resent. Such as when he told us, with screams of laughter, that if you want the Cross it\u2019s to please your uncle and that your uncle was a footman.\u201d \u201cHe told you that!\u201d cried Charlie, believing, on the strength of this adroitly interpolated quotation, in the truth of everything that Mme. Verdurin had said! Mme. Verdurin was overwhelmed with the joy of an old mistress who, just as her young lover was on the point of deserting her, has succeeded in breaking off his marriage, and it is possible that she had not calculated her lie, that she was not even consciously lying. A sort of sentimental logic, something perhaps more elementary still, a sort of nervous reflex urging her, in order to brighten her life and preserve her happiness, to stir up trouble in the little clan, may have brought impulsively to her lips, without giving her time to check their veracity, these assertions diabolically effective if not rigorously exact. \u201cIf he had only repeated it to us, it wouldn\u2019t matter,\u201d the Mistress went on, \u201cwe know better than to listen to what he says, besides, what does a man\u2019s origin matter, you have your own value, you are what you make yourself, but that he should use it to make Mme. de Portefin laugh\u201d (Mme. Verdurin named this lady on purpose because she knew that Charlie admired her) \u201cthat is what vexes us: my husband said to me when he heard him: \u2018I would sooner he had struck me in the face.\u2019 For he is as fond of you as I am, don\u2019t you know, is Gustave\u201d (from this we learn that M. Verdurin\u2019s name was Gustave). \u201cHe is really very sensitive.\u201d \u201cBut I never told you I was fond of him,\u201d muttered M. Verdurin, acting the kind-hearted curmudgeon. \u201cIt is Charlus that is fond of him.\u201d \u201cOh, no! Now I realise the difference, I was betrayed by a scoundrel and you, you are good,\u201d Charlie exclaimed in all sincerity. \u201cNo, no,\u201d murmured Mme. Verdurin, seeking to retain her victory, for she felt that her Wednesdays were safe, but not to abuse it: \u201cscoundrel is too strong; he does harm, a great deal of harm, unconsciously; you know that tale about the Legion of Honour was the affair of a moment. And it would be painful to me to repeat all that he said about your family,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, who would have been greatly embarrassed had she been asked to do so. \u201cOh, even if it only took a moment, it proves that he is a traitor,\u201d cried Morel. It was at this moment that we returned to the drawing-room. \u201cAh!\u201d exclaimed M. de Charlus when he saw that Morel was in the room, advancing upon him with the alacrity of the man who has skillfully organised a whole evening\u2019s entertainment with a view to an assignation with a woman, and in his excitement never imagines that he has with his own hands set the snare in which he will presently be caught and publicly thrashed by bravoes stationed in readiness by her husband. \u201cWell, after all it is none too soon; are you satisfied, young glory, and presently young knight of the Legion of Honour? For very soon you will be able to sport your Cross,\u201d M. de Charlus said to Morel with a tender and triumphant air, but by the very mention of the decoration endorsed Mme. Verdurin\u2019s lies, which appeared to Morel to be indisputable truth. \u201cLeave me alone, I forbid you to come near me,\u201d Morel shouted at the Baron. \u201cYou know what I mean, all right, I\u2019m not the first young man you\u2019ve tried to corrupt!\u201d My sole consolation lay in the thought that I was about to see Morel and the Verdurins pulverised by M. de Charlus. For a thousand times less an offence I had been visited with his furious rage, no one was safe from it, a king would not have intimidated him. Instead of which, an extraordinary thing happened. One saw M. de Charlus dumb, stupefied, measuring the depths of his misery without understanding its cause, finding not a word to utter, raising his eyes to stare at each of the company in turn, with a questioning, outraged, suppliant air, which seemed to be asking them not so much what had happened as what answer he ought to make. And yet M. de Charlus possessed all the resources, not merely of eloquence but of audacity, when, seized by a rage which had long been simmering against some one, he reduced him to desperation, with the most outrageous speeches, in front of a scandalised society which had never imagined that anyone could go so far. M. de Charlus, on these occasions, burned, convulsed with a sort of epilepsy, which left everyone trembling. But in these instances he had the initiative, he launched the attack, he said whatever came into his mind (just as Bloch was able to make fun of Jews and blushed if the word Jew was uttered in his hearing). Perhaps what struck him speechless was \u2014 when he saw that M. and Mme. Verdurin turned their eyes from him and that no one was coming to his rescue \u2014 his anguish at the moment and, still more, his dread of greater anguish to come; or else that, not having lost his temper in advance, in imagination, and forged his thunderbolt, not having his rage ready as a weapon in his hand, he had been seized and dealt a mortal blow at the moment when he was unarmed (for, sensitive, neurotic, hysterical, his impulses were genuine, but his courage was a sham; indeed, as I had always thought, and this was what made me like him, his malice was a sham also: the people whom he hated, he hated because he thought that they looked down upon him; had they been civil to him, instead of flying into a furious rage with them, he would have taken them to his bosom, and he did not shew the normal reactions of a man of honour who has been insulted); or else that, in a sphere which was not his own, he felt himself less at his ease and less courageous than he would have been in the Faubourg. The fact remains that, in this drawing-room which he despised, this great nobleman (in whom his sense of superiority to the middle classes was no less essentially inherent than it had been in any of his ancestors who had stood in the dock before the Revolutionary Tribunal) could do nothing, in a paralysis of all his members, including his tongue, but cast in every direction glances of terror, outraged by the violence that had been done to him, no less suppliant than questioning. In a situation so cruelly unforeseen, this great talker could do no more than stammer: \u201cWhat does it all mean, what has happened?\u201d His question was not even heard. And the eternal pantomime of panic terror has so little altered, that this elderly gentleman, to whom a disagreeable incident had just occurred in a Parisian drawing-room, unconsciously repeated the various formal attitudes in which the Greek sculptors of the earliest times symbolised the terror of nymphs pursued by the Great Pan\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ambassador who has been recalled, the undersecretary placed suddenly on the retired list, the man about town whom people began to cut, the lover who has been shewn the door examine sometimes for months on end the event that has shattered their hopes; they turn it over and over like a projectile fired at them they know not whence or by whom, almost as though it were a meteorite. They would fain know the elements that compose this strange engine which has burst upon them, learn what hostilities may be detected in them. Chemists have at least the power of analysis; sick men suffering from a malady the origin of which they do not know can send for the doctor; criminal mysteries are more or less solved by the examining magistrate. But when it comes to the disconcerting actions of our fellow-men, we rarely discover their motives. Thus M. de Charlus, to anticipate the days that followed this party to which we shall presently return, could see in Charlie\u2019s attitude one thing alone that was self-evident. Charlie, who had often threatened the Baron that he would tell people of the passion that he inspired in him, must have seized the opportunity to do so when he considered that he had now sufficiently \u2018arrived\u2019 to be able to fly unaided. And he must, out of sheer ingratitude, have told Mme. Verdurin everything. But how had she allowed herself to be taken in (for the Baron, having made up his mind to deny the story, had already persuaded himself that the sentiments for which he was blamed were imaginary)? Some friends of Mme. Verdurin, who themselves perhaps felt a passion for Charlie, must have prepared the ground. Accordingly, M. de Charlus during the next few days wrote terrible letters to a number of the faithful, who were entirely innocent and concluded that he must be mad; then he went to Mme. Verdurin with a long and moving tale, which had not at all the effect that he desired. For in the first place Mme. Verdurin repeated to the Baron: \u201cAll you need do is not to bother about him, treat him with scorn, he is a mere boy.\u201d Now the Baron longed only for a reconciliation. In the second place, to bring this about, by depriving Charlie of everything of which he had felt himself assured, he asked Mme. Verdurin not to invite him again; a request which she met with a refusal that brought upon her angry and sarcastic letters from M. de Charlus. Flitting from one supposition to another, the Baron never arrived at the truth, which was that the blow had not come from Morel. It is true that he might have learned this by asking him for a few minutes\u2019 conversation. But he felt that this would injure his dignity and would be against the interests of his love. He had been insulted, he awaited an explanation. There is, for that matter, almost invariably, attached to the idea of a conversation which might clear up a misunderstanding, another idea which, whatever the reason, prevents us from agreeing to that conversation. The man who is abased and has shewn his weakness on a score of occasions, will furnish proofs of pride on the twenty-first, the only occasion on which it would serve him not to adopt a headstrong and arrogant attitude but to dispel an error which will take root in his adversary failing a contradiction. As for the social side of the incident, the rumour spread abroad that M. de Charlus had been turned out of the Verdurins\u2019 house at the moment when he was attempting to rape a young musician. The effect of this rumour was that nobody was surprised when M. de Charlus did not appear again at the Verdurins\u2019, and whenever he happened by chance to meet, anywhere else, one of the faithful whom he had suspected and insulted, as this person had a grudge against the Baron who himself abstained from greeting him, people were not surprised, realising that no member of the little clan would ever wish to speak to the Baron again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While M. de Charlus, rendered speechless by Morel\u2019s words and by the attitude of the Mistress, stood there in the pose of the nymph a prey to Panic terror, M. and Mme. Verdurin had retired to the outer drawing-room, as a sign of diplomatic rupture, leaving M. de Charlus by himself, while on the platform Morel was putting his violin in its case. \u201cNow you must tell us exactly what happened,\u201d Mme. Verdurin appealed avidly to her husband. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you can have said to him, he looked quite upset,\u201d said Ski, \u201cthere are tears in his eyes.\u201d Pretending not to have understood: \u201cI\u2019m sure, nothing that I said could make any difference to him,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, employing one of those stratagems which do not deceive everybody, so as to force the sculptor to repeat that Charlie was in tears, tears which filled the Mistress with too much pride for her to be willing to run the risk that one or other of the faithful, who might not have heard what was said, remained in ignorance of them. \u201cNo, it has made a difference, for I saw big tears glistening in his eyes,\u201d said the sculptor in a low tone with a smile of malicious connivance, and a sidelong glance to make sure that Morel was still on the platform and could not overhear the conversation. But there was somebody who did overhear, and whose presence, as soon as it was observed, was to restore to Morel one of the hopes that he had forfeited. This was the Queen of Naples, who, having left her fan behind, had thought it more polite, on coming away from another party to which she had gone on, to call for it in person. She had entered the room quite quietly, as though she were ashamed of herself, prepared to make apologies for her presence, and to pay a little call upon her hostess now that all the other guests had gone. But no one had heard her come in, in the heat of the incident the meaning of which she had at once gathered, and which set her ablaze with indignation. \u201cSki says that he had tears in his eyes, did you notice that? I did not see any tears. Ah, yes, I remember now,\u201d she corrected herself, in the fear that her denial might not be believed. \u201cAs for Charlus, he\u2019s not far off them, he ought to take a chair, he\u2019s tottering on his feet, he\u2019ll be on the floor in another minute,\u201d she said with a pitiless laugh. At that moment Morel hastened towards her: \u201cIsn\u2019t that lady the Queen of Naples?\u201d he asked (albeit he knew quite well that she was), pointing to Her Majesty who was making her way towards Charlus. \u201cAfter what has just happened, I can no longer, I\u2019m afraid, ask the Baron to present me.\u201d \u201cWait, I shall take you to her myself,\u201d said Mme. Verdurin, and, followed by a few of the faithful, but not by myself and Brichot who made haste to go and call for our hats and coats, she advanced upon the Queen who was talking to M. de Charlus. He had imagined that the realisation of his great desire that Morel should be presented to the Queen of Naples could be prevented only by the improbable demise of that lady. But we picture the future as a reflexion of the present projected into empty space, whereas it is the result, often almost immediate, of causes which for the most part escape our notice. Not an hour had passed, and now M. de Charlus would have given everything he possessed in order that Morel should not be presented to the Queen. Mme. Verdurin made the Queen a curtsey. Seeing that the other appeared not to recognise her: \u201cI am Mme. Verdurin. Your Majesty does not remember me.\u201d \u201cQuite well,\u201d said the Queen as she continued so naturally to converse with M. de Charlus and with an air of such complete indifference that Mme. Verdurin doubted whether it was to herself that this \u2018Quite well\u2019 had been addressed, uttered with a marvellously detached intonation, which wrung from M. de Charlus, despite his broken heart, a smile of expert and delighted appreciation of the art of impertinence. Morel, who had watched from the distance the preparations for his presentation, now approached. The Queen offered her arm to M. de Charlus. With him, too, she was vexed, but only because he did not make a more energetic stand against vile detractors. She was crimson with shame for him whom the Verdurins dared to treat in this fashion. The entirely simple civility which she had shewn them a few hours earlier, and the arrogant pride with which she now stood up to face them, had their source in the same region of her heart. The Queen, as a woman full of good nature, regarded good nature first and foremost in the form of an unshakable attachment to the people whom she liked, to her own family, to all the Princes of her race, among whom was M. de Charlus, and, after them, to all the people of the middle classes or of the humblest populace who knew how to respect those whom she liked and felt well-disposed towards them. It was as to a woman endowed with these sound instincts that she had shewn kindness to Mme. Verdurin. And, no doubt, this is a narrow conception, somewhat Tory, and increasingly obsolete, of good nature. But this does not mean that her good nature was any less genuine or ardent. The ancients were no less strongly attached to the group of humanity to which they devoted themselves because it did not exceed the limits of their city, nor are the men of to-day to their country than will be those who in the future love the United States of the World. In my own immediate surroundings, I have had an example of this in my mother whom Mme. de Cambremer and Mme. de Guermantes could never persuade to take part in any philanthropic undertaking, to join any patriotic workroom, to sell or to be a patroness at any bazaar. I do not go so far as to say that she was right in doing good only when her heart had first spoken, and in reserving for her own family, for her servants, for the unfortunate whom chance brought in her way, her treasures of love and generosity, but I do know that these, like those of my grandmother, were unbounded and exceeded by far anything that Mme. de Guermantes or Mme. de Cambremer ever could have done or did. The case of the Queen of Naples was altogether different, but even here it must be admitted that her conception of deserving people was not at all that set forth in those novels of Dostoievski which Albertine had taken from my shelves and devoured, that is to say in the guise of wheedling parasites, thieves, drunkards, at one moment stupid, at another insolent, debauchees, at a pinch murderers. Extremes, however, meet, since the noble man, the brother, the outraged kinsman whom the Queen sought to defend, was M. de Charlus, that is to say, notwithstanding his birth and all the family ties that bound him to the Queen, a man whose virtue was hedged round by many vices. \u201cYou do not look at all well, my dear cousin,\u201d she said to M. de Charlus. \u201cL\u00e9an upon my arm. Be sure that it will still support you. It is firm enough for that.\u201d Then, raising her eyes proudly to face her adversaries (at that moment, Ski told me, there were in front of her Mme. Verdurin and Morel), \u201cYou know that, in the past, at Gaeta, it held the mob in defiance. It will be able to serve you as a rampart.\u201d And it was thus, taking the Baron on her arm and without having allowed Morel to be presented to her, that the splendid sister of the Empress Elisabeth left the house. It might be supposed, in view of M. de Charlus\u2019s terrible nature, the persecutions with which he terrorised even his own family, that he would, after the events of this evening, let loose his fury and practise reprisals upon the Verdurins. We have seen why nothing of this sort occurred at first. Then the Baron, having caught cold shortly afterwards, and contracted the septic pneumonia which was very rife that winter, was for long regarded by his doctors, and regarded himself, as being at the point of death, and lay for many months suspended between it and life. Was there simply a physical change, and the substitution of a different malady for the neurosis that had previously made him lose all control of himself in his outbursts of rage? For it is too obvious to suppose that, having never taken the Verdurins seriously, from the social point of view, but having come at last to understand the part that they had played, he was unable to feel the resentment that he would have felt for any of his equals; too obvious also to remember that neurotics, irritated on the slightest provocation by imaginary and inoffensive enemies, become on the contrary inoffensive as soon as anyone takes the offensive against them, and that we can calm them more easily by flinging cold water in their faces than by attempting to prove to them the inanity of their grievances. It is probably not in a physical change that we ought to seek the explanation of this absence of rancour, but far more in the malady itself. It exhausted the Baron so completely that he had little leisure left in which to think about the Verdurins. He was almost dead. We mentioned offensives; even those which have only a posthumous effect require, if we are to \u2018stage\u2019 them properly, the sacrifice of a part of our strength. M. de Charlus had too little strength left for the activity of a preparation. We hear often of mortal enemies who open their eyes to gaze upon one another in the hour of death and close them again, made happy. This must be a rare occurrence, except when death surprises us in the midst of life. It is, on the contrary, at the moment when we have nothing left to lose, that we are not bothered by the risks which, when full of life, we would lightly have undertaken. The spirit of vengeance forms part of life, it abandons us as a rule \u2014 notwithstanding certain exceptions which, occurring in the heart of the same person, are, as we shall see, human contradictions \u2014 on the threshold of death. After having thought for a moment about the Verdurins, M. de Charlus felt that he was too weak, turned his face to the wall, and ceased to think about anything. If he often lay silent like this, it was not that he had lost his eloquence. It still flowed from its source, but it had changed. Detached from the violence which it had so often adorned, it was no more now than an almost mystic eloquence decorated with words of meekness, words from the Gospel, an apparent resignation to death. He talked especially on the days when he thought that he would live. A relapse made him silent. This Christian meekness into which his splendid violence was transposed (as is in Esther the so different genius of Andromaque) provoked the admiration of those who came to his bedside. It would have provoked that of the Verdurins themselves, who could not have helped adoring a man whom his weakness had made them hate. It is true that thoughts which were Christian only in appearance rose to the surface. He implored the Archangel Gabriel to appear and announce to him, as to the Prophet, at what time the Messiah would come to him. And, breaking off with a sweet and sorrowful smile, he would add: \u201cBut the Archangel must not ask me, as he asked Daniel, to have patience for \u2018seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks,\u2019 for I should be dead before then.\u201d The person whom he awaited thus was Morel. And so he asked the Archangel Raphael to bring him to him, as he had brought the young Tobias. And, introducing more human methods (like sick Popes who, while ordering masses to be said, do not neglect to send for their doctors), he insinuated to his visitors that if Brichot were to bring him without delay his young Tobias, perhaps the Archangel Raphael would consent to restore Brichot\u2019s sight, as he had done to the father of Tobias, or as had happened in the sheep-pool of Bethesda. But, notwithstanding these human lapses, the moral purity of M. de Charlus\u2019s conversation had none the less become alarming. Vanity, slander, the insanity of malice and pride, had alike disappeared. Morally M. de Charlus had been raised far above the level at which he had lived in the past. But this moral perfection, as to the reality of which his oratorical art was for that matter capable of deceiving more than one of his compassionate audience, this perfection vanished with the malady which had laboured on its behalf. M. de Charlus returned along the downward slope with a rapidity which, as we shall see, continued steadily to increase. But the Verdurins\u2019 attitude towards him was by that time no more than a somewhat distant memory which more immediate outbursts prevented from reviving\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To turn back to the Verdurins\u2019 party, when the host and hostess were by themselves, M. Verdurin said to his wife: \u201cYou know where Cottard has gone? He is with Saniette: he has been speculating to put himself straight and has gone smash. When he got home just now after leaving us, and learned that he hadn\u2019t a penny in the world and nearly a million francs of debts, Saniette had a stroke.\u201d \u201cBut then, why did he gamble, it\u2019s idiotic, he was the last person in the world to succeed at that game. Cleverer men than he get plucked at it, and he was born to let himself be swindled by every Tom, Dick and Harry.\u201d \u201cWhy, of course, we have always known that he was an idiot,\u201d said M. Verdurin. \u201cAnyhow, this is the result. Here you have a man who will be turned out of house and home to-morrow by his landlord, who is going to find himself utterly penniless; his family don\u2019t like him, Forcheville is the last man in the world to do anything for him. And so it occurred to me, I don\u2019t wish to do anything that doesn\u2019t meet with your approval, but we might perhaps be able to scrape up a small income for him so that he shan\u2019t be too conscious of his ruin, so that he can keep a roof over his head.\u201d \u201cI entirely agree with you, it is very good of you to have thought of it. But you say \u2018a roof; the imbecile has kept on an apartment beyond his means, he can\u2019t remain in it, we shall have to find him a couple of rooms somewhere. I understand that at the present moment he is still paying six or seven thousand francs for his apartment.\u201d \u201cSix thousand, five hundred. But he is greatly attached to his home. In short, he has had his first stroke, he can scarcely live more than two or three years. Suppose we were to allow him ten thousand francs for three years. It seems to me that we should be able to afford that. We might for instance this year, instead of taking la Raspeli\u00e8re again, get hold of something on a simpler scale. With our income, it seems to me that to sacrifice ten thousand francs a year for three years is not out of the question.\u201d \u201cVery well, there\u2019s only the nuisance that people will get to know about it, we shall be expected to do it again for others.\u201d \u201cBelieve me, I have thought about that. I shall do it only upon the express condition that nobody knows anything about it. Thank you, I have no desire that we should become the benefactors of the human race. No philanthropy! What we might do is to tell him that the money has been left to him by Princess Sherbatoff.\u201d \u201cBut will he believe it? She consulted Cottard about her will.\u201d \u201cIf the worse comes to the worst, we might take Cottard into our confidence, he is used to professional secrecy, he makes an enormous amount of money, he won\u2019t be like one of those busybodies one is obliged to hush up. He may even be willing to say, perhaps, that it was himself that the Princess appointed as her agent. In that way we shouldn\u2019t even appear. That would avoid all the nuisance of scenes, and gratitude, and speeches.\u201d M. Verdurin added an expression which made quite plain the kind of touching scenes and speeches which they were anxious to avoid. But it cannot have been reported to me correctly, for it was not a French expression, but one of those terms that are to be found in certain families to denote certain things, annoying things especially, probably because people wish to indicate them in the hearing of the persons concerned without being understood! An expression of this sort is generally a survival from an earlier condition of the family. In a Jewish family, for instance, it will be a ritual term diverted from its true meaning, and perhaps the only Hebrew word with which the family, now thoroughly French, is still acquainted. In a family that is strongly provincial, it will be a term in the local dialect, albeit the family no longer speaks or even understands that dialect. In a family that has come from South America and no longer speaks anything but French, it will be a Spanish word. And, in the next generation, the word will no longer exist save as a childish memory. They may remember quite well that their parents at table used to allude to the servants who were waiting, without being understood by them, by employing some such word, but the children cannot tell exactly what the word meant, whether it was Spanish, Hebrew, German, dialect, if indeed it ever belonged to any language and was not a proper name or a word entirely forged. The uncertainty can be cleared up only if they have a great-uncle, a cousin still surviving who must have used the same expression. As I never knew any relative of the Verdurins, I have never been able to reconstruct the word. All I know is that it certainly drew a smile from Mme. Verdurin, for the use of this language less general, more personal, more secret, than their everyday speech inspires in those who use it among themselves a sense of self-importance which is always accompanied by a certain satisfaction. After this moment of mirth: \u201cBut if Cottard talks,\u201d Mme. Verdurin objected. \u201cHe will not talk.\u201d He did mention it, to myself at least, for it was from him that I learned of this incident a few years later, actually at the funeral of Saniette. I was sorry that I had not known of it earlier. For one thing the knowledge would have brought me more rapidly to the idea that we ought never to feel resentment towards other people, ought never to judge them by some memory of an unkind action, for we do not know all the good that, at other moments, their hearts may have sincerely desired and realised; no doubt the evil form which we have established once and for all will recur, but the heart is far more rich than that, has many other forms that will recur, also, to these people, whose kindness we refuse to admit because of the occasion on which they behaved badly. Furthermore, this revelation by Cottard must inevitably have had an effect upon me, because by altering my opinion of the Verdurins, this revelation, had it been made to me earlier, would have dispelled the suspicions that I had formed as to the part that the Verdurins might be playing between Albertine and myself, would have dispelled them, wrongly perhaps as it happened, for if M. Verdurin \u2014 whom I supposed, with increasing certainty, to be the most malicious man alive \u2014 had certain virtues, he was nevertheless tormenting to the point of the most savage persecution, and so jealous of his domination over the little clan as not to shrink from the basest falsehoods, from the fomentation of the most unjustified hatreds, in order to sever any ties between the faithful which had not as their sole object the strengthening of the little group. He was a man capable of disinterested action, of unostentatious generosity, that does not necessarily mean a man of feeling, nor a pleasant man, nor a scrupulous, nor a truthful, nor always a good man. A partial goodness, in which there persisted, perhaps, a trace of the family whom my great-aunt had known, existed probably in him in view of this action before I discovered it, as America or the North Pole existed before Columbus or Peary. Nevertheless, at the moment of my discovery, M. Verdurin\u2019s nature offered me a new and unimagined aspect; and so I am brought up against the difficulty of presenting a permanent image as well of a character as of societies and passions. For it changes no less than they, and if we seek to portray what is relatively unchanging in it, we see it present in succession different aspects (implying that it cannot remain still but keeps moving) to the disconcerted artistEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1062147", "artist_names": "Lee Dorsey", "full_title": "Ya Ya by\u00a0Lee\u00a0Dorsey",

We supposed to believe you fucking Rambo holding chrome there, please\nTell me you throwing AK's over them shoulder blades, I'm like, \"Bro don't make me crazy.\"\nJust cause you can't fill in simple paper work, don't blame me\nHe could be Diggin' In The Crates he still wouldn't show A.G\nPlus the last time you were in London, your bitch didn't know where she was staying or splitting\nPlus I heard your boy Stacks got married, it's a fucking shame that he did it\nLeast now that crew that you repping has a name that is fitting\nTeam Hockey, perfect, you just get played by women\nAnd you can suck a ten inch long dick if you think I'm backing down, a cock steak\nYou're more likely see an Al-Qaeda application from Sandi Toksvig!\nYou more likely see Jim Halpert from out of The Office\nWelcoming Julian Assange to the House Of Commons\nBut like every MC that steps to me, he'll say it's a blessing he accepted me\nSee I should be indebted that you would ever spend a second to set this test for me\nBut getting on a jet from the west is an eleven hour step at least\nAnd that's exceptional measure to level with someone not worth a breath you breathe\nSo whatever B, if it's clever schemes you telling me then you set yourself up for Jeopardy\nI'm Jeffy P, the general of Germany smelling of gelling cream\nThat's why I hedge bets he'd never suspect, I'll sever deez\nI'm from the 70's that's why my side parting and quick styling\nFor women [?] collecting C's I mean\nYou're about [?] blatant intelligence and working these battles leagues\nAs I am for well...stage presence and personality\nYou've been on that same soapbox since '09 and I still find it obnoxious\nYou're inclined to critique blindly with no real kind of options\nI mean, they tell you you have ill lines, so how can you kill time and props when\nYou don't know if you're the black or the white guy in the Ill Mind Of Hopsin?\n[Round 1: Caustic]\nI said comparing me to Walter Salamanca is just lame\nCause if you ever hustled a day in your life you'd know that's just part of the game\nHeard your girl calls you dick \"Breaking Bad\" cause you got a small business crank\nSo she hid you from her family like Walt did to Hank\nI said I'm back in London\nYou don't even gotta ask why\nAll I know is this skinny motherfucker right here better act right\nOh you Jefferson right?\nYou don't wanna be that guy\nMotherfucker about to get raped in front of everybody he knows...yep, that guy\nIf he wins this battle, he's gonna celebrate\nAct like a total faggot\nIf I win this battle...who gives a shit that's what's suppose to happen\nI was sitting in baggage claim and it dawned on me that there's no way this man is straight\nI mean, goddamn, you're gay you act like such a fucking faggot J\nYou're what would happen if gay dudes could have babies the old fashioned way\nI said I bet you didn't know that I know that you used to be called \"Digga\"\nBut nah Digga when I start busting rhymes (Busta Rhymes) you lost Digga\nDon't make me Flipmodes to prove that you all filler\nJust cause you rap like a bitch don't mean that you raw (Rah) Digga\nI said he can't fuck his fat lady cause his little dick be slipping out\nIt's funny that they call you \"Digga\" when you can't properly dig her out\nHe's insecure about his dick so he constantly lives in doubt\nHis girl's pussy is like the White House\nNo Bush and there's a black guy in it now\nI said every time she sees a black dude she gets moist\nPlus that pussy holes deeper than Dekay's voice\nYo I will grab your bird and fuck the hole in her face\nThen afterwards be like, \"Check it ho I need space.\"\nThe bitch had the nerve to tell me she loved me, like 30 times\nI said, \"Bitch I need space\" like Mr. 13's eyes\nI'm a Street Fighter like Sonny Chiba, dragon that don't die\nI'll E Honda slap him, I'll smack him on both eyes\nHadouken flash, kick him, I'll fucking tacking him to clothes lines\nZangief pile driver be cracking your whole spine\nMy defense style is Guile so I take no damage from those lines\nHe starts talking stupid, I sonic boom him, I've been holding back the whole time\n[Round 2: Jefferson Price]\nYo, you wanted to battle Mark Grist, try to jump on that band wagon\nBut I doubt you'd see two million views from Teacher vs Random Snap Back Faggot\nYou can say shit about me and my outfit, that's okay I don't mind\nCause it just looks like you just clothes lined Jim Jones' clothesline\nShit, you can walk around like you a legend but over here they hardly know ya\nHe basically makes up a large part of the quota of every half assed Obama voter from Nantucket to Calistoga\nType to think cause they got a black president that America's forward thinking\nBut matter of fact you was posh, fat and a woman so...one-nill to England\nWhen I first seen Caustic I thought he was dead girl in a [?]\nCause you so pale bro you probably get rain stroke\nShit, you can even go ahead and flip that and say my pastiness is more than you\nBut you live in California so what the fuck is your excuse?\nAh fuck it, you can hit me with said angles, you know you're clashing DF's geriatric\nNah faggot, you clashing Tom Petty's section in [?]\nThat black and white is well documented\nWatch me end it badly, have him living in Discworld off Good Omens like Terry Pratchett\nBut I ain't a fighter, so my writing is the left that landed\nMy pen it dances, the devil next to the men it catches\nMy set is Cassius, soon as my stepping active\nLeave him weaved back and forth like a Mexican blanket\nIn case you didn't know Daniel is a proud Italian\nMother pass the salsa so illy\nShe mixing that tomato and garlic with home chilli\nBut of Yankee Italians who never go to Italy\nSo say you ball, you get the foot like [?]\nPlus I had this whole thing when I was gonna say he was Italian with a Jew nose but he be like, \"Don't give me that please.\"\nI was gonna say like, \"I know Joey Tribbiani so are you Joey Tribbianstein?\nBut he be like, \"More fucking nose jokes\" yeah we all know it's fucked\nWell then he said he was a west coast vet, I said, \"Yeah like Nate Dogg. You only known for the hook.\"\n[Round 2: Caustic]\nThat's it? Oh shit\nYou make fun of my fucking hat you idiot, you can suck my fucking balls\nCause if I'm not mistaken your girl is the fat fucking bitch with the snap back up against the wall\nI said, I don't gotta brag about my gun charge, that's be breaking the code J\nI don't gotta tell these people I got sentenced to seven years for hustling cocaine\nI mean I don't even gotta give you the rest of this propane\nBut I will talk about my dick cause you can fucking suck the whole thing\nAre you kidding me?\nThis is supposed to be this big beast of a writer?\nI haven't heard a verse that wack since Chipmunk did the B.E.T. Cypher\nYo Eurgh, I apologize for the Deffinition battle bro\nI wasn't coming prepared\nBut honestly, I only took that battle to fuck Holly Halston and the fucking bitch wasn't even there\nIt's like he's pissed off about religion\nHe fucking got resentments because all the Christians at Jeff's church used to show Jefferson love\nI mean, why would you bring up Jesus when nobody mentioned it once\nOkay we get it, God's not real, but the priest that molested you was\nAll that pseudo intellect bullshit ain't gonna fool us\nPlus this dumb faggot paid for my flight cause he thought it'd be a good way to get his views up\nYo, you wanna walk a mile in my shoes, then start lacing your boots up\nBut this crowd is tough as leather, they will not be suede/swayed by some new buck/nubuck\nPublic service announcement\nBrushing your teeth is just something that you have to do\nIt's not okay to have morning breath this late in the afternoon\nYour mouth smells like you've been eating H-Bomb pussy\nThat shit's fucking foul inside\nSomebody find this man some formaldehyde\nOr whatever the fuck climbed inside your mouth and died\nIf this is son's/suns time to shine then I'm a solar eclipse\nIf this is his jump to top tier then I hope you eat shit\nYour motherfucking face looks like an aborted fetus\nAnd your body's the coat hanger they scraped out the ovaries with\nYou little bony weak bitch\nYour body's built like the string of a tampon\nAnd congratulations on making an album out of J-57's beats that I passed on\nI mean, no hate to Brown Bag, y'all my motherfucking friends for life\nBut your kid's getting out of line, I might have to break out that belt tonight\nYou will always be wack even when Soul Khan helps you write\nI guess that's what you get for relying on a Jew to give you a better Price\n\n[Round 3: Jefferson Price]\nNo offense but....ah actually yeah take offense by this\nThe FreshCoast is just a jizz stain of it's former glory\nI remember when Eurgh and Crugs when there they called us \"fags\" and said that Don't Flop was boring\nNotice now they're keeping their mouths shut cause they know they making it worse\nAnd Eurgh stood in the corner grinning like, \"How the tables have turned.\"\nBut out of all the FreshCoast boy band you should be the most pissed off\nCause you been in a shit spot ever since the kid you fought Jim was gonna fix it got his shit tossed\nSee I can't even front and say this dude is even wack\nShit that ain't even gas I consider him a beast in fact\nWhen people talk about battling as a career like we're reaching for that\nIt's only those with steady hands that keep a career from a crash\nSo a career, how can most even perceive it at that?\nThis is a hobby, most of us don't get a p when we rap\nAn 1/8th get paid an 1/8th get somewhere to sleep and crash\nAnd the rest of us get free entry and somewhere to leave our bags\nNow that's the real tier system, getting paid to maim victims\nYou are very near making out wishing a clear vision\nL.A. Riotz, M.O.B., Battle Of The Bay, Grizzle, he was throwing straight missiles\nBut most of 'em ain't hitting, imagine\nHe was like Lunar in '09, when Marvel and A shared that top tier spot\nSo it should be easy money now that the top tiers gone\nHe was lining up battles with T-Rex, nah you ain't hear wrong\nBut not even T-Rex was willing to give him that ear shot\nDot Mobb\nPH and X-Factor were another two making a switch\nIf Grind Time was the other guy you'd be the paper bitch\nBattle leagues been moving you off\nYour opponents a loaner and earn fast\nYou can never get to mirror the opus of Soul Khan\nSo you got Stockholm Syndrome while throwing them cold battles\nAnd fell in love with the people who were fucking you so hard\nShit...\n{Chokes}\nSee that's the point, you see I get why you do it\nSometimes shit can be stale at home\nSometimes it feels you wanna be somewhere where you ain't alone\nI mean the birds wanna wank you off and the dudes say that you're dope\nIt's like a little bit of praise it feels like some fame of our own\nI mean, they said that's the lesson\nYou can be a beast never the less but that ain't never what they selling\nCause amidst the handshakes and yelling the real test of intelligence\nIs making sure you never mistake respect for progression\nAll the big battles you get, you ending their lives\nEvery big battle I get, I've lost...every time\nAnd that's my point about progression summed up in this next line\nIs that your name didn't even look out of place next to mine\nIn conclusion...fuck off it's a birthday\nLet's start drinking\nAnd another four years at Don't Flop will make that two-nil to England\nLet's fucking go\n\n[Round 3: Caustic]\nY'all ready?\nSorry kiddo\n\nLast night there was an incident\nSomebody decided to tell Jeff my rhymes\nI've seen a lot of things in this battle game, but I never had anybody beg for mercy ahead of time\nWhen he caught wind of what I did, he got so fucking upset\nHe told Mickey if I went through with this round he wouldn't show to the event\nWe had a conversation\nThere were some compromises made, and honestly, not a lot was changed\nCause all I told you was that I would probably drop the names\nBut you know that we agreed to, but there were no promises made\nAnd you may have talked to Daniel Stefani yesterday, but you're fucking talking to Caustic today\nI said it's Caustic, homie, I'm known to body rappers\nI break a motherfucker down, I'm starting to offer classes\nYou be the exact motherfucker I hate, acting like a cocky bastard\nThen go home to your fat fiancee Carly after you just got done opening condom wrappers with that...\n\n[Uno Lavoz]\n...fucking bitch Holly Masters\n\n[Caustic]\n(Hey, I kept my word, right?)\nOooh, this shit just got incredibly real\nLuckily for me, I don't fucking care how you feel\nWhy should I change my verses? You're the one who's gotta carry the guilt\nSo with that said, let's talk about that...\n\n[Uno Lavoz]\n...girl Sarah McGill\n\n[Caustic]\n(You mad? Oh, cry. Got the cry face.)\nWhat, you think you the man, Jeff? Fucking sluts is not impressive\nEspecially when it's Verb T and Joker Starr's sloppy seconds\nThat shit is fucking disgusting\nYou probably got infected and thought, \"Hey, now's as good a time as any to go home and pop the question.\"\nYo, how you gonna marry a fat girl that you ashamed of obviously?\nFuck getting engaged, you need to fucking engage in some honesty\nI mean I'm not hating on relationships\nThey say the best things in life are free\nBut what did you get her for your anniversary homie? Fucking H.I.V.?\nI mean, he's scared of his baby mama cause she's elephant size\nSo he fucks random strippers, he's a hell of a guy\nSo ladies, next time you get approached by Jefferson Price\nWhy don't you tell him to go home and try fucking on his heavyset wife?\nI don't even get how you sleep at the end of the night\nI honestly hope every last sperm inside your testicles dies\nSo stop running around England like you some sexual prize\nAnd deal with the fact that you got to sleep next to that fat bitch for the rest of your life\nHe begged me not to do this, but honestly this bitch deserves it\nAnd the only thing I learned about England is never spit your verses for that fucking snitch Micky Worthless\nYo, if your wife still says \"I do\" to you after this verse, then she's fucking high on drugs\nBut remember this while you're writing your vows kid:\nYou can't put a Price on loveEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1794051", "artist_names": "Little Caesar", "full_title": "Those Oldies But Goodies (remind Me Of You) by\u00a0Little\u00a0Caesar", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "id": 1794051, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1431530201, "path": "/Little-caesar-those-oldies-but-goodies-remind-me-of-you-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Little-caesar-those-oldies-but-goodies-remind-me-of-you-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "song_art_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Those Oldies But Goodies (remind Me Of You)", "title_with_featured": "Those Oldies But Goodies (remind Me Of You)", "updated_by_human_at": 1445441514, "url": "https://genius.com/Little-caesar-those-oldies-but-goodies-remind-me-of-you-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/363040", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669754445", "id": 363040, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669754445", "index_character": "l", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Little Caesar", "slug": "Little-caesar", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Little-caesar"}, "artist": "Little Caesar", "lyrics": "Those Oldies But Goodies (remind Me Of You) LyricsThose Oldies But Goodies (Remind Me Of You)\n-Artists: Little Caesar and the Romans\n- peak Billboard position # 9 in 1961\n- Words and Music by Paul Politti and Nick Curinga\nThose oldies but goodies reminds me of you\nThe songs of the past bring back memories of you\nI always remember the first night we met\nThe songs they were playing I never will forget\nI always will treasure them so close to my heart\nThey always will haunt me although we're apart\nEach time that I hear them a tear's bound to fall\nFor I love those memories that I, I-I recall\nThose oldies but goodies reminds me of you\nThe songs of the past bring back memories of you\nForever they will haunt me but what can I do?\nThose oldies but goodies reminds me of\nYou\n(Oldies but goodies reminds me of you)\nSPOKEN: \"Yes, dear, they are playin' our songs.
