geeked\nTalkin' 'bout sleep, I get two days a week\nThey say they drippin', I'm kissin' my teeth\nThey burnin' it out, ain't no chrome left for me\nWhen I was broke, I was feelin' uneasy\nNow I get paid and I'm feelin' relieved\n[Verse 1: NAV]\nCall up a thottie, I hit when I please\nWhatever it take, might just pay her to leave\nMy bitch Latina, my choppa is Russian\nWheezy on beats, that's expensive percussion\nCan't get no Act', so we sippin' on red\nCan't talk to my bro 'cause he still in the feds\nCan't get these demons up outta my head\nCan't slide on the opps 'cause they already dead\nWhat I can do (What you do?), I can go get some money\nWhole pool heated up and it cost a hundred thousand 'cause I left that shit runnin' (No cap)\nI can turn nothin' to somethin', book me a show and I fly out the country (Let's go)\nI eat at Nobu when I get the munchies (Let's go)\nDrivin' in bucket seats, had to serve buckets\nI put the top down and I let her suck it\n\n[Chorus:

firearm under my belt and I run with some real ones who bang to the left\nMarchin' band, baby, I know how to step, I can't speak on the business, it's quiet as kept\nLook like a diva, I know how to treat her, I know how to keep her, she fine as hell\nI spend a quarter milli' on a Richard Millie, I keep quiet, I'm never gon' tell\nI put my life savings in the brown box, I was gettin' that shit in the mail\nI keep a mil' cash for the best lawyer, I ain't worried 'bout goin' to jail\nI just spent 8K on some Herm\u00e8s bags, 50K more on Chanel\nI got the ball now, ain't gon' ball-hog, I'ma pass it to bro for the layup\nI just went Prada T-shirt with the Prada jacket, you can tell I'm a motherfuckin' player\n\n[Chorus: NAV & Lil Baby]\nI don't need friends (Yeah, Baby)\nThey don't wanna see

LAROI]\nFuck you, goodbye\nYou hurt me, for the last time\nIt's time for me to move on\nSo fuck you and goodbye\nI gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)\nYeah, all of the time that I wasted (Yeah, yeah)\nFuck you, goodbye\nYou hurt me, for the last time\n\n[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]\nWait, that was a lie\nBecause I cannot erase you like eternal sunshine in a spotless mind\nRed in the eyes, lately I've been on a cocaine diet\nI've been tryin' to feed my high\nYour things are still in the box that you left in the bedroom\nYou'll leave, and I'm here\nWith no heart, guess I'll be dead soon\nGhost in a shell, stoned like a cemetery\nScars don't heal, I got these in February\nBroke your spell, love is only temporary\nHighway to hell, I'm hangin' out the roof, yellin'\n\n[Chorus: The Kid LAROI, Machine Gun Kelly & Both]\nFuck you, goodbye (Yeah)\nYou hurt me, for the last time\nIt's time for me to move on\nSo fuck you and goodbye\nI gave you love and I hate it (Yeah, yeah)\nYeah,

(On God)\nHigh school, I ain't even go, I was hangin' in the colony tryna sell gas (Straight up)\nIn a hotbox with Chevy, Lil Harold, and Rock, ready to crash (21)\nTried to break in the pawnshop on Candler Road, but the rod wouldn't smash (21)\nLarry got killed, couldn't believe this shit, man, the tears started falling' down fast (On God)\nLick on McAfee, found a ho, split, but we really had

Metro Boomin - No Opp Left Behind (Traducci\u00f3n al Espa\u00f1ol)No Opp Left Behind Lyrics[Intro]\nMetro in this bitch goin' brazy\n\n[Verse 1]\nMade it out the dirt, I was head first\nA nigga used to rob, ayy, and I used to serve\nCouldn't go to work, school was the worst\nPussy tried to play me, ayy, put him on a shirt\nLambo real fast, fell in love with cash\nFell in love with head, ayy, I fell in love with ass\nScience, I was 'sleep, ayy, I fell in love with math\nShe was at the club, ayy, I made her take a bath\nAyy, I'm King Smoke, so I got a drum on the stick\nGang was in there, I can't put my tongue on that shit\nHe was talkin' crazy 'til that hollow hit his lip\nAyy, Big 4L, even the killers gettin' killed\nAll you see is Pateks and APs in my clique\nW\u0435 got all the bottles and the hookah in th\u0435 VIP\nI might be a rapper, but it's thirty in this clip\nAyy, Zone 6, we get niggas buried 'round this bitch\n[Chorus]\nPitbull the way I walk, way I talk\nLoose lips sink ships, yellow tape, white chalk\nMultitask, use the pistol and the fork\nScreamin', \"No opp left behind,\" nigga, we gon' kill 'em all\nAin't no cap in my rap, ain't no flaw\nYou could tell it when I rap, ain't no cut, this shit raw\nCut him off if he talkin' to the law\nI'm with Draco 'cause he quiet 'til he hit you in the jaw\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy lil' niggas don't wanna trap, they wanna spin\nAyy, spin, fill the choppas up, then spin again\nFree my dawg, he not ink, so why he in a pen'?\nFrom Atlanta, not Vegas, but I still sin\nAyy, chain like a yo-yo, ride me like a pogo\nShe from out of D.C., when she fuck me, she play go-go\nUsed to sip lines, now a nigga sippin' Fours, though\nNiggas rappin' gangsta, but they really hoes, though\nStreet niggas, streets don't talk, but you told, though\nRattail hangin' in the hood, boy, you bold bold\nWe ain't tryna hear 'bout all the bricks that you sold sold\nThey don't need a badge, but them niggas still the po-po\nFocused on my bag, focused on my money\nI done had some dark days, I done had some sunny\nNiggas think they hot, I think niggas funny\nAyy, yellow baguette, VV-VVS's look like honey\nAll my diamonds pissed on, ayy, Andre Drummond\nMy playa won't even pull inside the 'partments 'cause they haunted\nMy dawg could've passed me the ball, but he punted\nGot my turn, did a onside kick, that's how I'm comin'\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nPitbull the way I walk, way I talk\nLoose lips sink ships, yellow tape, white chalk\nMultitask, use the pistol and the fork\nScreamin', \"No opp left behind,\" nigga, we gon' kill 'em all\nAin't no cap in my rap, ain't no flaw\nYou could tell it when I rap, ain't no cut, this shit raw\nCut him off if he talkin' to the law\nI'm with Draco 'cause he quiet 'til he hit you in the

he hit you in the jaw\n\n[Skit: Morgan Freeman]\nA wise man knows not to have a lot of enemies\nThe friction of constant conflict is a distraction in life\nAnd left unchecked can end up being what subtracts him from life\nIf possible, all enemies should be eliminated12Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/3406355", "artist_names": "Gerald Haywood", "full_title":

love\nOctober 22nd, 1992\nJuly 8th, 2009 (Zaytoven)\nYou will be missed forever (Metro Boomin wants some more, nigga)\n\n[Chorus]\nRest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago (Long time ago, straight up)\nHard times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on (I'm the one you counted on, 21)\nMy shoulder took a lot of tears, woulda swore it was a fountain on (Shit brazy)\nI be cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the cameras on (On God)\n[Verse 1]\nWoulda never went against you ever (21)\nI even tried to make the grudge settle (Straight up)\nYeah, I heard that you slept with a couple fellas (Straight up)\nStill treated you like a virgin because I know you better (On God)\nWhen she suck it, take my soul, she a whole devil (21)\nBought a Wagon then I covered it with rose petals (Skrrt)\nShe didn't think I was romantic 'cause I'm so ghetto\nGot a Patek and a Birkin, it was fundamental\nThen the situation took a U-turn (Fuck)\nFoundation crumbled and the roof burned (21)\nI ain't perfect, I was slidin' like a earthworm, loco\nBut I never, ever brought the dirt home (On God)\nMan, we both played each other, you was worse, though (21)\nAlways blamin' me because I did it first, though (21)\nYou started sleepin' with your phone in your purse, though\nAnd you had that pussy nigga fragrance on your skirt, ho (Punk bitch)\n\n[Chorus]\nRest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago (Long time ago, straight up)\nHard times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on (I'm the one you counted on, 21)\nMy shoulder took a lot of tears, woulda swore it was a fountain on (Shit brazy)\nI be cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the cameras on (On God)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI had your back, you put a knife in mine (Now I'm scarred)\nIf you was finna lose your life, I woulda gave you mine (On God)\nI sit back and reminisce sometimes (Just be thinkin', you know, 'bout the old days)\nI used to drink my syrup while you drank your wine (My old ways)\nCan't believe what we came to (21)\nYou won't believe what the fame do\nWe ain't together, any problems, I still came through (Straight up)\nHeard he put his hands on you, that's what lames do (Pussy)\nGot my first taste of love and I thank you (Thank you)\nSavage, never let another woman taint you (21)\nFallen victim to my feelings, something I can't do (Never)\nGet revenge on every bitch, even if it ain't you (On God)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nRest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago (F-U-C L-U-V)\nHard times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on (One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

that door, we just gon' walk down\nThey say we dead wrong 'cause we knocked him off\nBut he who got caught lackin', tell that bitch that that's his fault\nIf we draw down, guns get let off\nAt all them clowns, including his spouse\nKept that blick inside my drawers\nEvery time I walked to Dalton\nI worked for Tim and sold CD's\nYou throw a diss and you get tossed\nSay you ain't catch that, cross my name up, ain't no talking (Yeah)\nIf they had a bang-out at the store, from my papa window, I could see it sparkin'\nBut I ain't seen that since Jordan Dixon made some niggas some targets\nBig 40, got that shit on me in a stolo, nigga knowin' that it's retarded\nI spit that shit that cause a massacre at the party, believe that\n\n[Chorus]\nI said right foot creep, ooh, I'm

while I'm standin' on Billy\nDirty Drac', take the top off the Hemi\nFully equipped it when we go on a mission\nTake his face, I ain't showin' no pity\nClosed case, tell them all good riddance\nZombieland where the dogs can scent it\nSprinter van and we all be in it\nCatch him first, get a raw percentage\nIf you want, I put a coffin in it\nI could get you one from inside my home\nI just want to check the bitch out for attendance\nTell them niggas I say fuck 'em all\nAnd I'ma kill all you bitches (That's on your mama, bitch)\n\n[Chorus]\nI said right foot creep, ooh, I'm walking

You don't really know where you from\nYou don't how deep your roots is or what your ancestors had done\nSo, God bless all of the sons and daughters\nWho knew they history so they knew where to take it farther\nAnd all the ones that stuck with me like good barbers\nLookin' at my life story, God's a good author\nNever was the loudest in the room, we move like ninjas\nAnd if it cost your peace of mind, it might be too expensive\nSo I can't give you everything that you want from me for free though\nGet you one shot in life, you might not be able to reload\nSo advanced, I need all my advances\nBro hit me up for cash like we didn't have the same chances\nMy dad hit me up like, \"Why I don't live in a mansion?\"\nI'm tryna focus, but baby girl keep holdin' my mind for ransom\nAnd that ain't how it supposed to be, this man Hov got to a B\nAnd his name Shawn too, I almost felt like it was me\nDamn, I realized all my setbacks were inside of me\nIn high school, I learned chemistry, biology\nBut not how to cope with anxiety\nOr how I could feel like I'm by myself on an island\nWith depression on all sides of me (Damn)\nWith a Glock seventeen right on the side of me (Hol' up)\nLook, I ain't think I had the thought of suicide in me\nUntil life showed me all these different sides of me\nToo many times I thought the reaper was outside for me (Ooh)\nAnd how the fuck it's people that never met me that hate me?\nI wonder if they understand that I meditate daily\nAnd feel like my life purpose is to give inspiration\nDespite the hit songs that there's just no escapin'\nThat I take care of my family and beat the odds that were deadly\nYou hate that, that just reflects your lack of succession, bless 'em\nIf it ain't Nipsey blue, it's Detroit blue\nThis that Detroit 2, I'm bringin' it back to my hood like d-boys do\nGone (Gone)\nYou might also like[Outro: Nipsey Hussle & Comic J Will]\nSo, the collaboration though, with Nipsey and who?\nAw man, I'd probably say Payroll, eh, or Tee Grizzley\nMe and Big Sean talked about doin' somethin' recently, too\nSo, you know, all of them, I'ma, I'ma tap in with all of Detroit\nFuck rap, I'm a street legend\nBlock love me with a deep reverence51Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/5917243", "artist_names": "Big Sean (Ft.

block and it's back to servin' fiends (Yeah)\n[Verse]\nI don't drink Belaire (Nah), but I'm in Bel Air like I'm Uncle Phil\nDon't call me bluff, nigga, I am and, nigga, I will, look (Nigga, I

force to be reckoned, I'm God's perfection\nLook, God gave me a lot in some months, but it could go in a second\nIf I fuck the wrong bitch (Woo) or walk up in the wrong section\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't

industry?\nLike, a hundred years from now, how do you want people to remember you?\nPop Smoke did this, he did that, he did what?\nPop Smoke came in and changed the game\nPop Smoke came in and showed them niggas a new vibe\nYou know, the whole sound, the whole vibe, the whole movement\nDifferent\nForever my heart, forever my dawgs\nWe still gon' put on for you\nThe smoke will never clear\nNever\nWoo, woo, woo, grrt-baowYou might also like17Embed"}]
