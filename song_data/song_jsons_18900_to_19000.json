to get by\n'Cause I don't try\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn my paper cup, I have installed\nA shower stall across the hall\nRunning water and a den\nIt's looking just like home again\nI'm free and I've installed refrigerated air\nYou'd have to look inside\nBefore you know that I was there\n[Bridge 1]\nAnd everybody says I'm quite insane\nAnd someday I'll be going down the drain\nI know they're right (But I don't care)\nI feel no pain\n\n[Verse 3]\nHere inside my paper cup\nEverything is lookin' up\nNo one goes out, no one comes in\nIt's lookin' just like home again\nI'm free and it's so easy to get\nThe things I've always wanted\n'Cause I don't really want 'em anymore\n\n[Bridge 2]\nAnd living ain't so bad without a rudder\nAnd life is kinda groovy in the gutter\nIf you know how (And I do)\nYeah, and I do (We do, too)\n\n[Verse 4]\nSo if you'd like to come along\nWe'll sing a little paper song\nAbout a lonely paper plate\nWho couldn't find a paper mate\nYou might also like[Interlude]\nI'm free, yes, I'm free\n\n[Outro]\nAnd my life is lookin' up\nFrom inside my paper cup\nAnd I'm always lookin' up\nFrom inside my paper cup\nAnd my life is lookin' up\nFrom inside my paper cup\nAnd I'm always lookin' up\nFrom inside my paper cup...Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/923263", "artist_names": "Brenda & The Tabulations", "full_title": "When You're Gone

I'd start to move (Whoa, whoa, whoa)\nAnd tell my story walking (Whoa, whoa, whoa)\nAbout a hundred miles an hour\n\n[Chorus]\nStay away from Lightning's girl\nAnd this part of town\nStay away from

"It\u2019s the Little Things LyricsYou're not the kind of guy that make the girls all sigh\nAnd they never turn their heads and look when you walk by\nBut baby that's OK, I love you anyway\nAnd I never change or rearrange you so stay that way\n\n'Cause it's the little things that mean a lot\nIt's what you are, not what you got\n\nCall my name and I'll come running\nLook at me and the clouds start sunning\nHold my hand and you got me going\nKiss my lips and my mind starts going\nWe got a thing that won't stop cooking\nYou turn me on just by looking\nYou can make me strong just by sighing\nYou can break my heart just by crying\n\nYou're not the smartest man that I ever met\nAnd every word you ever said I won't forget\nAnd so I guess that's why until the day I die\nWhen you're bad and make me sad, you're still my guy\n\n'Cause it's the little things that mean a lot\nIt's what you are, not what you got\n\nCall my name and I'll come running\nLook at me and the clouds start sunning\nHold my hand and you got me going\nKiss my lips and my mind starts going\n\nWe got a thing that won't stop cooking\nYou turn me on, baby, just by looking\nYou can make me strong just by

Of 2014 (So Far) LyricsWhich is harder to believe, that it's only July, or that it's already July?! Guess it depends on your perspective...\n\nAll we know is that, as we're hit by record-high heats across North America, our summer jams are helping us through it. What better time than the halfway point of 2K14 to revisit the albums that made us rock out and rocked us to sleep, that moved us to tears and moved our asses across the dance floor, that had us singing into hairbrushes and brushing up against greatness?\n\nWe got a bunch of our best and brightest (or at least verbosest) to lay it down for you so that next time you need tunes, you got 'em. Peep our picks below!Against Me! - Transgender Dysphoria Blues@NicoleWitte's PickTransgender Dysphoria Blues is Against Me!\u2019s most combustible and illuminating song cycle yet. Newly-stripped of former producer Butch Vig\u2019s pop sheen, it\u2019s both more sonically raw and lyrically searing than AM!\u2019s last couple of albums. By most standards, AM! is the most commercially viable rock band to explicitly and autobiographically address transgender experience, which is part of what makes this collection of singalongs so vital. It also serves as an excellent primer on how to reach the near-universal through the specific and personal. Almost anyone who has experienced depression will feel their heart seize as Grace sings the crushing truth:Even if your love was unconditional\nIt still wouldn\u2019t be enough to save meNo, this album is about the messy and difficult work of saving yourself in a hostile world full of terrible people pathologically invested in not letting you to be who you are. It\u2019s an album full of difficult questions and horrible pain, as well as the sweetness of survivalAs if you were a kingmaker!\nAs if as if as if!Grace taunts an asshole she\u2019s cut loose from her life in a moment of especially gleeful catharsis\n\nAs great as this album is, nothing beats the live renditions of these songs. I hope you will all get to witness a packed club full of (mostly cisgender) punk kids wailingDoes god bless your transsexual heart, true trans soul rebel?As if their lives depended on it!Coldplay - Ghost Stories@VerseChorusBridge's PickChris Martin, in an interview with Zane Lowe, described the band\u2019s hauntingly beautiful sixth studio album, Ghost Stories, as \"42 minutes on an emotional treadmill\". There are no better words to describe this piece of uplifting beauty. A concept album fueled by pure emotions stemming from Martin\u2019s falling relationship with then-wife Gwyneth Paltrow, Ghost Stories is a collection of philosophical and emotional ideas and feelings presented through the mind of a man who had lost his love. Affectionately strong in its ability to reach out to the listener, the album proves to be the band\u2019s most lyrically powerful to date, with the band showing their softer, more vulnerable side, giving their audience a rare chance to connect with the themes and values that the album professes\n\nGhost Stories not only hits the mark on an poetic and artistic standpoint, it\u2019s musical soundscape, uplifted by the talent of producers Guy Berryman, Paul Epworth, Daniel Green and Rik Simpson with a little help from friends Jon Hopkins and Avicii, is yet again another reminder of Coldplay\u2019s unique ability to transform themselves with each album. Even after five unique, bombastic and impressive studio albums, the band still manage to bust out a sound so alienatingly different from the rest, producing a somewhat chilling ambient atmosphere to compliment your 42-minute emotional treadmill session. While the album is less than a season old, the album still makes a massive short-term impact, and is, without second thought, my favourite album of 2014 thus far The Felice Brothers -  Favorite Waitress @EwokABDevito's PickLegendary traveling band \"The Felice Brothers\" have produced a brand  new, visceral-twisting, genre-bending album; \"Favorite Waitress\"\nCombining elements from their earlier more 'raw' material like \"Through These Reigns And Gone\" and innovative sound exploring albums like \"Celebration, Florida\", to frankenstein pure nostalgia wrapped in a blanket of modernity\nSome songs have a tragic folkish ring that spirals down your earholes and uses your heart for a trampoline, while others grab you by the seam of your pants and get you dancing in ways you didn't even know you could! The album is laden with all sorts of references across the artistic spectrum, showcasing the bands ability to make any subject matter poetic to the highest degree. Most critics have been rather harsh of the vocals, yet their delivery is absolutely necessary to create the unique and heartwrenching sound that is \"The Felice Brothers\" The album is so diverse, I dare you to listen to \"Hawthorne\" and tell me that song doesn't have a \"timeless\" ring to it, As if it could have been written at any time within the last 45 years. \"The Felice Brothers\" have been on the scene for a good 9 years, Released 10 INCREDIBLE albums, and there's no sign of them stopping anytime soonThe Gloaming - The Gloaming@MattyEdgeworth's First PickThe Gloaming are virtuoso musicians comprising Iarla \u00d3 Lionaird, the legendary fiddler Martin Hayes, violinist Caoimh\u00edn \u00d3 Raghallaigh, plus American guitarist Dennis Cahill and, perhaps surprisingly, pianist Thomas Bartlett. This breathtaking album is nothing like the others on the list, it\u2019s a hauntingly beautiful take on traditional Irish music that feels just as modern as it does a classical composition. The music soars and you clumsily fumble for the right words to describe it\nThe language might be Irish, rather than English, but that is completely irrelevant, the emotion is universal.The vocals are delivered full of soul and feeling by Iarla \u00d3 Lionaird in the Sean-n\u00f3s tradition, which is a highly ornamented style of vocal in the beautiful language of Irish GaelicHeiruspecs - Night FallsHWULA's pickNight Falls is the first Heiruspecs album since 2008\u2019s self-titled effort. With every project, Heiruspecs offer a lot of variety, and prove to be incredibly versatile; this LP is no different. They transition very well too, going from straight headbangers on \u201cWATF (We Are The Future)\u201d to the more introspective \u201cPower\u201d and \u201cHerriors\u201d. Midway Felix and Muad\u2019Dib have both improved their flow, and are still as lyrically tuned as ever. The rhyme schemes are interesting, and Muad\u2019Dib continues to ride the instrumentation as well as he did on 2004\u2019s A Tiger Dancing. Felix still utilizes his motormouth flow, but often  switches it up\n\nAs for instrumentation, the band has broadened, and sounds incredibly seasoned. It feels more aggressive, rather than the (mostly) chilled and relaxing vibe from Heiruspecs. There are tracks with that laid-back sound, such as \u201cCruise Control\u201d and \u201cBeen Around\u201d. There are different sounds on this project, including a violin on \u201cCruise Control\u201d, an 808 over the live drums and some staccato brass on \u201cDrive Slow\u201d and even, what sounds like experimentation with a turntable on the Chastity Brown-featured \u201cOn the Ground.\u201d\n\nOne of my favorite tracks, coming from someone who hasn\u2019t seen an episode of Breaking Bad, is \u201cWalter White\u201d, the closer. Felix flows very nice over the acoustic guitar and live drums. The ahs and oos on the hook add to the chilling experience. It feels very atmospheric and dark\n\nThere isn\u2019t a dislikeable track on this whole LP. I definitely think this is one of the few albums to satisfy me this yearJack White - Lazaretto@Vesuvius's PickWhat do you do when you have perfected the sound that made you famous? Post-Achtung Baby, it seems the usual response is to radically change your sound, risking alienating your fans. Jack White\u2019s far too savvy to fall into that trap though. Lazaretto is a natural evolution of the sound he\u2019s been developing for fifteen years. Rather basing his songs around a synth, White seems to be being influenced more and more by the blues that he loves, as well as incorporating elements of country, bluegrass, hip hop, and even a little electronica. His characters are no longer the na\u00efve young men of White Blood Cells, deep in adolescent infatuation and impossible not to sympathize with, but increasingly they\u2019re bitter, cynical and dealing with the issues of middle age, only happy when singing about alcohol. The result is White\u2019s most lyrically compelling album\n\nAfter twelve albums from White and his bands, it\u2019s easy to take him for granted \u2013 but of all contemporary pop musicians, only Damon Albarn has been as consistently compelling for longer. Like Blunderbuss before it, Lazaretto deserves to be held in the same regard as White Blood Cells and ElephantLana Del Rey - Ultraviolence@BigBadBonj's PickAfter major label debut Born To Die, which followed a formula of sultry vocals of dark, hip-hop influenced production, many judged Lana Del Rey. Many critics and others branded her everything from a \"fake\" to simply discrediting her music and image. Ultraviolence is the largest message to these detractors \u2014 Lana Del Rey is here to stay\n\nWith the album\u2019s title being a reference to classic novel A Clockwork Orange, this LP sees a change from its predecessor with The Black Keys' Dan Auerbach producing dark and hazy songs navigated by lonely electric guitar riffs. From the outset, \"Cruel World\" introduces the dramatic tapestry which is Lana\u2019s life. This very same imperfection \u2014 detailing flawed people and sordid acts \u2014 typifies its appeal. In the first half of the album, momentum flows freely, with its main highlights being slightly hipster-fueled \"Brooklyn Baby\" and surf-rock influenced \"West Coast\" The album closes with a cover of the classic Nina Simone song \"The Other Woman,\" Lana gives another nod to her musical past. Nostalgic and chaotic at the same time, Ultraviolence is an ode to how Lana Del Rey is an old head on some young shouldersLindsey Sterling - Shatter Me@chihuahua0's PickShatter Me isn\u2019t the easiest to annotate, due to being an instrumental album with only two full-vocal songs, but no one else does electronic violin music better than Lindsey. It lacks her debut\u2019s fresh feel, but features more ambitious violin playing and diverse production from both Stirling and SILAS\n\nSongs like \u201cRoundtable Rival\u201d showcases the album\u2019s talents, with Lindsey\u2019s violin emulating a fiddle, and even a electric guitar. Meanwhile, \u201cTake Flight\u201d perfectly conveys its title, combining vivid strings, angelic vocalists, and Skrillex-y flairs. Her EDM is for the most part The lyrics might be straight-forward, but Lizzy Hale\u2019s rock vocals provides a more progressive sound. Overall, Shatter Me is both suitable, and enjoyable, by all agesM\u00d8 - No Mythologies To Follow@saltkin's PickThe inspirations behind this album are myriad \u2013 Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Sonic Youth, the Spice Girls, Santigold, and Mo\u2019s \u201cfascination\u201d with rap, crunk, and grunge. Instead of sounding like any one of those, however, NMTF uses futuristic Electronic production from Ronni Vindhal with R&B sounding beats to craft an album full of its own distinct sound. It has everything \u2013 electronic breakdowns, funky horn sections, fluid strings, gurgling bass lines, and clever, sample-worthy beats. The melodies and production aren\u2019t the only reason this record is so good, though. M\u00d8 is dissatisfied with a lot of things about the world today, but never comes across as whiny. Instead, her eloquence adds a different voice to the perspective of disappointed youth. Between rising call to arms \u201cFire Rides\u201d and emotional ballad \u201cGone and Found\u201d, the sixteen tracks on this album have truly made my yearSay Anything- Hebrews@xWHALESHARQx's First PickHebrews is Say Anything\u2019s Machina: The Machines of God, an album bigger and weirder and more intensely divisive than anything that came before it. Love what Say Anything is all about? Then you will love this album. Like Billy Corgan before him, Bemis doesn\u2019t kowtow to the haters, but rips them a big ol\u2019 new one, producing an album both hilarious and invigorating for its Larry-David-esque monologues on what it means to be both an ailing pop star and a new father. It amounts to nothing less than a complete re-evaluation of Say Anything\u2019s discography in light of the redemption of making a family, complete with wife, child, and home (and even dogs)\n\nWhat\u2019s more is that the album was recorded with no guitars (well, save for one solo on \u201cSix Six Six\u201d and light accompaniment on \u201cLost My Touch\u201d), a suggestion of Tim O\u2019Heir\u2019s brought beautifully to life by one of rock\u2019s great unsung session heroes, Jeremy Larson, who lays on the string parts written by Bemis as though he were a one-man orchestra. It\u2019s as if \u201cDo Better,\u201d one of the better songs on 2009\u2019s self-titled, were revisited and expanded into an entire record. Add in features from heavyweights like Blink 182 vocalist Tom Delonge and Sufi-poet-cum-coolest-guy-on-earth Aaron Weiss, and it\u2019s a successful throwback to Say Anything\u2019s glory days, all the while looking boldly towards an equally glorious futureScHoolboy Q - Oxymoron@noLxmits's PickAs the opening track begins, we get a snippet of Q\u2019s young daughter speaking to the listener; the juxtaposition of an innocent girl narrating such a hood rap album is almost an oxymoron itself. The album starts out with a string of stand-out bangers, including \u201cLos Awesome\u201d and \u201cCollard Greens\u201d, which are well produced and feature fellow Black Hippies Jay Rock and Kendrick Lamar. \u201cHell Of A Night\u201d has, hands down, one of the dirtiest, grittiest hooks I\u2019ve ever experienced, and equally beautiful production\n\nOther tracks detail Q\u2019s life and upbringing. \u201cHoover Street\u201d was one of the tracks that you could tell Q put a lot of his past into, where he explains his early life where they had a housing situation due to his uncle\u2019s wife leaving him. On \u201cPrescription/Oxymoron\u201d, Q first spits about his addiction to prescription medicines, and how he would doze off even when his daughter needed some attention, then the track transitions to Q selling Oxycontin pills, instead of crack. \u201cBlind Threats\u201d and \u201cBreak The Bank\u201d pull the listener into the life of a hood drug distributor. \u201cHis & Her Fiend\u201d is a track that Q raps from the point of view from an Oxycontin pill, \u201cevery drug addict\u2019s friend\u201d\n\nThis album surpasses Q\u2019s last two albums, and really put him up there with some of the best in his label TDE. Even though this album has its flaws, the good definitely outweighs the bad. All in all, the album is really well put together, and is worth properly checking outSleeping At Last - Atlas: Year One@xWHALESHARQx's Second PickMaybe I just have a thing for ridiculously expansive high-concept albums, but when an artist releases an album that spans across six discs, so large it needs a clothbound box to house it all in, and the album is gorgeous post-rock, folk, pop, and emo, all mashed together, I tend to go in for that sort of thing. When they announce that it's only part one of (at least) two planned parts, I go apeshit!\n\nI spent the better part of 2014 not only listening to but experiencing this music. Because of SAL's business model (you subscribe to the album and get a new disc every few months), I was like a kid in a candy store every time I went to the post office. My favourite disc? Space 2, home to the shimmering arena-rock keys of \"Pluto,\" the (ironically) saturnine bass of \"Neptune,\" the orchestral grandeur of \"Jupiter.\" Where was this guy when they were scoring Cosmos?\n\nRyan O'Neill is an artist quietly at the peak of his form, comfortable in the blanket of his niche and going where the wind takes him. I, for one, am following!St. Vincent - St. Vincent@TheRaconteur's PickThe first time I heard St. Vincent I was taken aback by how the howls of her guitar would clash with the angelic tones of her voice. What vivid dissonance her music held. It\u2019s something Annie Clark had long mastered; she does best when her guitar crackles out her fits of pain. And still, her newest, the self-titled St. Vincent is perhaps her boldest as she opens the door to some of her warmest sounds yet. It\u2019s not just her guitar now. It\u2019s in her voice. Amongst the rockingly delicious cacophonies, Clark is pushing towards her emotions. It\u2019s her very own version of In Rainbows: a warmer, more human affair\n\nHer music still growls to the notes of the avant-garde but there are dances to be had here. These songs make your bones move while contemplating the tattered emotions lying underneath. It\u2019s this balance that other artists would struggle with but Clark sparks with such newfound confidence, it\u2019s mesmerizing. Special mention must go to \u201cI Prefer Your Love,\" a lush fragile lullaby for her mother. Never before has Clark reached such stark intimacy. From the cult thumps of \u201cDigital Witness\u201d to the wails of \u201cRegret\u201d, you can hear it. Unfiltered emotion. With every record, Clark manages to continue to evolve and now she\u2019s officially graduated from indie sainthood to rock divinity. AmenSun Kil Moon - Benji@nietzsche's PickTo read the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\u2019s section on authenticity while listening to Sun Kil Moon\u2019s latest album Benji is an exercise in experiencing the motion of words. Every definition, every description of an authentic life and action that is read simultaneously becomes manifested in your ears while listening to the impossibly minimalist meta masterpiece Mark Kozelek bestowed unto us. We, as a society, seem to clamor for grief porn, for the admiration of the small-town, middle-class aesthetic while simultaneously desiring to observe it all from a safe distance. We require grand caricatures or populist relatability, yet without ever running the background checks, the results of which we know and want to shield ourselves from. We desire the concept of authenticity, but only when employed under the pretenses of bad faith. In a world where lengthy essays and reviews contribute to the justifications of the aforementioned bad faith, to seek to add auxiliary words to what Kozelek wrote is to tarnish the authentic purity of the album. Sure, we have all experienced similar emotions and scenarios that are conceptualized on Benji, but there isn\u2019t a moment on this magnum opus where anybody but Mark can enter the album. And that, that is what exalts Benji and will forever keep it as a record of asylum; our friend Mark\u2019s been through it already, and he\u2019s turned out quite wellTemples - Sun Structures@MattyEdgeworth's Second PickThe debut album from neo-psychedelic rock band Temples is a mesmerizing piece of music. In some ways, it\u2019s entirely unoriginal, given how heavily it recalls the original psychedelic experiments of the late 60s, but that is what is also so good about it. Of all the psychedelic bands that have appeared in recent years, Temples are one of those that sounds most similar to the original thing. There are a good mixture of jangly, Byrdsian tunes and more atmospheric tracks. It really does sound like it could have come out during the \u201860s and nobody would have blinked\nYes, there are very clear influences here, but Temples manage to weave them together to create something that still sounds unique enough to remain interesting. Think something along the lines of The Beatles' Revolver crossed with The Zombies and The Byrds, with a touch of T-Rex for good measure. AwesometUnE yArDs - Nikki Nack@saltkin's Second PickFor the last two tUnE-yArDs albums, Merril Garbus has kept their ethos or spirit intact while transporting it to a new sound, new lyrical point, and more advanced production. Instead of giving up their distinct outlet in favour of selling out, however, Merrill and co. have managed to make another brilliant album, this time focusing on \u2013 of all things \u2013 writer\u2019s block\n\nOf course, the album takes us for a ride of discontent all over the socio-political map, but Merrill\u2019s struggle with and ultimate trial over her demons is the uniting thread of the record. From the hyper, neo-dirge \"Water Fountain\" and surreal interlude \"Why Must We Dine on the Tots\" to the depressed and thoughtful \"Wait for a Minute\" and funky \"Manchild,\" Merrill \u2013 with co-conspirators and producers Malay and John Hill close behind \u2013 has proven her talent once again, and managed once again to make music that really doesn\u2019t sound like anything elseThe War On Drugs - Lost In The DreamBen Swanson's PickMaking the connection between The War on Drugs and '80s heartland rock (namely Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and Bob Dylan) is almost too obvious to make but one that inevitably will be drawn. Classic rock tropes appear frequently on this ten track journey. The synth on \"Burning\" feels like a natural progression from \"Born to Run\" and \"Eyes to the Wind\" feels like it could have been leftover from Wildflowers. Like former band member Kurt Vile, the songs here noodle along centered around a main riff that slowly builds a hazy wall of sound around it. Also, like Vile, frontman Adam Granduciel lets loose an occasional \u201cWhoo!\u201d with a simple chord change that send the songs into new dimensions and transcend the simple structures\n\nThe titles of the tracks here would suggest a rather dreary affair but the songs never get weighed down in their own sorrow. Rather, it seems as if Granduciel was working himself through depression with these, at times, triumphant songs to pull himself out of it and making discoveries about himself within the music. \"Red Eyes\" is one of the best songs of the year, despite the fact that the lyrics are nearly indecipherable. On first listen, \"Suffering\" is quite a downer after the triumphant \"Red Eyes\" and it took several listens to start to understand the sequencing. Granduciel leads the listener through the ups and downs that he was going through and as you open yourself up to the music, the music opens up to youWe Are The In Crowd - Weird Kids@primusliber's PickWe Are the In Crowd\u2019s new album was one of the most anticipated records in the pop punk scene in 2014, following the band\u2019s growing success in the previous years. Weird Kids showed that the band wasn\u2019t just a meteor in the scene, and proved to be one of the catchiest releases in the first half of the year. Led by the single \u201cThe Best Thing (That Never Happened)\u201d, with its alternative rock-sound reminiscent of the Brand New Eyes-era Paramore, the album clocks in at little more than 30 minutes, and includes some slower songs like \u201cCome Back Home\u201d and \u201cWindows in Heaven\u201d that do not kill the energy of the whole but instead result in the best tracks in the CD. This album is a step forward for the band in terms of catchiness, of lyrics and of overall variety, and if WATIC continue on this way, we can surely expect some amazing new music in the next few years

everything\nThere goes my only possession\nThere goes my everythingSee Engelbert Humperdinck LiveGet tickets as low as $48You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

you see an Asian get drug in plain sight\nEverybody Knows that when Asians write raps they probably do with symbols\nMarvelous Marvin, Royce even said you're a Hagler\nCause you Jew'ed your way into tunes with nickel\nI'm joking, you're official\nAnd when it comes to rappers with the biggest tits... you are O'fficial\nHey Illmac, you realize that anybody that's ever met you at anytime in your life can say they knew you when you were little\nHey, it could be worse, imp juice\nYou could be Everybody Knows\nYou ever heard one of his records bud?\nI'm gonna play that shit for my students to show them the effects of drugs\nI don't know if it's the acid hits or the fuckin' crystal meth he does\nBut I heard your tape buns like Emilio Estevez in the Breakfast Club\nListening to an album from Everybody Knows with Hawaiian production\nThere's not an amount that you could pay me\nI'd rather watch your family play Rock Band to see who has the hot hand with ukuleles\nI'd rather watch Illmac rap about waving around an Excalibur\nOr hear Stacks say \"Faggot!\" a thousand times in a round Frank, shameless like you playing the Gallagher\nBattles like this, will make me want to go back to teaching and circle a date on my calendar\nAnd Marv can get the iron to his head like he breaking in the McCallister's\nYou are an Asian lesbian from Hawaii\nI'll bet every woman you ever fucked in your life has up and turned dyke\nHow can you be a Mark, and look like Zuckerberg's wife?\nThat's one\nIllmaculate:\nEy it's rebuttal time\nSo what I just beat Chilla\nY'all just tryna beat each other\nI ain't even stutter\nI mean All Eyez On Me, the spirit of Afeni hovers\nCause I'm here fresh off a body like the tears of a grieving mother\nI swear to God there's normally five targets\nAnd I spit a round that no-one beats\nThis time, rappers counting on they sheep\nIt's five rappers, I leave rappers - I'm doubting that they'll sleep\nAnd I'm leaving 5-0;

it's like my mind run from me\nI swear to god my gun said \"Chit chit daw daw!\"\nDoug funnie\nBecause my brain is like Canibus' notebook bitch I got pages\nThere's bars on top of bars on top of bars; Las Vegas\nTaking shots in the car\nHotbox with chop' blazing\nThug Life tattoed on the stomach like Pac raised him\nSo save your gat bars so we can teach the Second Ammendment\nBitch I pass bars like I had protected defendant\nY'all think y'all was gone come to this battle and get paid off it\nFuck you faggots, this is Frank's profit\nGood thing you're Real Deal cause you are a fucking fake Caustic\nNever ever ever has there been a rapper that's more square\nYou be with 4th graders on the playground playing four square\nYou try to force your airs so they grow up to be sports players\nMotherfucker I'm a dwarf slayer\nSo I ain't referencing books when I'm grabbing my techs\nBut y'all better duck down and stand on my left\nBecause when I start popping shots at these standard guys' chests\nThey gone be left with less options than a standardised test\nHey yo Caddy, who bout to win this little Rumble in the club\nIs it A, B, C, D or E\nOh he said F you fucking faggots\nNone

care\nUnless we share\n\n[Chorus]\nCome to the sunshine\nHang your ups and downs you come to the sunshine\nCome to the sunshine\nYou know I know you know that I love youYou might also likeEmbed"},

prejudice leaped forth\n\"Rip down all hate\", I screamed\nLies that life is black and white\nSpoke from my skull, I dreamed\nRomantic flanks of musketeers\nFoundationed deep, somehow\n\n[Refrain]\nAh, but I was so much older then\nI'm younger than that now\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand\nAt the mongrel dogs who teach\nFearing not I'd become my enemy\nIn the instant that I preach\nSisters fled by confusion boats\nMutiny from stern to bow\n\n[Refrain]\nAh, but I was so much older then\nI'm younger than that now\n\n[Solo]\nYou might also

that bloody Red Baron standing high on a hill\nThen he swooped down low, shouted, \"Curse you, Red Baron!\"\nThe German shook his fist. You could hear him swear\nHey, watch out, there, Snoopy. You're really in a mess\nYou thought you were through with that bloody Red Baron\nBut it looks like he's not down, yet\nThen a cry went up all over the land\nThe bloody Red Baron would strike again\nBut, brave, little Snoopy said, \"Never fear.\"\nAs he headed for his plane, all the people cheered\nHey, watch out, little Snoopy. You're really in a mess\nYou thought you were through with that bloody Red Baron\nBut it looks like he's not down, yet\n\nSnoopy blazed a trail straight across the sea\nSearching in vain for his enemy\nThen he found that German trying to fix his plane;\nA-sweatin' and a-flustered, about to go insane\n\nSnoopy landed for a pistol duel\nThe Baron was worried; Snoopy was cool\nHe fired a shot, missed, started to run\nBefore Snoopy had a chance to raise his gun\nHey, watch out, Red Baron. Snoopy is on your trail\nOne of these days, he's gonna make you pay, and you'll go straight to\nWell, watch out, Red Baron.

secret she's a dirty whore\nWe fucked in the cooler, my ass was cold\n'Cause I laid on the floor as my dick she rode\n\nThree sister, Lola, Lea and Lana\nTwo was nineteen the other older than Madonna\nAll fine as hell, fuck 'em all I wanna\nThrew my dick in their faces like a Hurricanrana\n\nMike E. Clark, Legz Diamond too\nThey can vouch, these rhymes are true\nAll my homies have heard us brag\nThey know about the hoes we tag\n\nOur young homie Clay heard us rap\nAnd said he had way more freaks than that\nWe told 'em like this, they might be freakin'\nBut boy you never had ICP treatment1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1078116", "artist_names": "Lowell

learned how to compare\nI've seen all of the circles and I've had my last affair\nAnd now I see the sparrows\nAs they begin to fly\nAnd all that's left for me to do\nIs cry\n\nThinking that I was lost

can't discover\nWho am I\nI long to wake up in the morning\nAnd find everything has changed\nAnd all the people that I meet don't wear a frown\nBut every day is just the same\nI'm chasing rainbows in the rain\nAll the dreams that I believe in let me down\n\nMaybe I'm reaching far too high\nFor I have something else entirely free\nThe love of someone close to me\nUnfettered by the world that hurries by\nUm, to question such good fortune\nWho am I?\n\nI long to wake up in the morning\nAnd find everything has changed\nAnd all the people that I meet don't wear a frown\nBut every day is just

me and he cried\nHe told me a story\nI know he hadn't lied\nSaid he went for a job\nAnd Mr. Man said\nWithout an education\nYou might as well be dead\nNow don't get me wrong\nHe said, it's not who you are\nBut people come to me\nFrom near and far\nBut I do just what\nAnd I follow the rules\nI didn't have an education\nSo I had to go back to school\n[Verse 2]\nMy friend told all his buddies\nThat he loved so well\nAnd of their personal troubles\nI will not tell\nNow those guys didn't seem good\nAnd they didn't seem bad\nThey didn't seem so happy\nAnd I know they weren't sad\nBut the point isn't\nThat they follow the rules\nThey got an education\nAnd they all been in school\nNow underneath his tears\nI could see the true fact\nWhen he dropped out of school\nHe never, never went back\n\n[Chorus]\nYou gotta, gotta listen now now\nWhat he said\nWithout an education\nYou might as well be dead\nLook here\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo one day he got tired\nOf his little spending change\nSo he looked up his friends\nTo check their pay range\nWhen he got there, the crib\nHe found that he was a drag\nBecause man, they were clean\nAnd his clothes were like rags\nOne was a business man\nWith plenty of dough\nHe had his thing so set up\nYou know he couldn't blow\nThe other had his job so uptight\nHe had his whole family\nAnd his kids all out of sight\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nTell me one more time now\nWhat he said\nWithout an education\nMight as well be dead\nYou got to, got to, got to get a little learning\nWhat he said\nWithout an education\nMight as well be dead\nLook here\n\n[Verse 4]\nWhat made him so hurt\nThat these were his friends and he was a drag\nThey looked at him\nAnd he was in the same old bag\nFor his friends they worked real hard\nWhen the work day was through\nNow, he realized\nHe should have done the same thing too\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me one more time now, looka here\nWhat he said\nWithout an education\nMight as well be dead\nYou got to, got to, got to get a little learning now\nWhat he said\nWithout an education\nMight as well be dead\n[Verse 5]\nFor the last time, I'm gonna say\nThey kept on pushing\nWhen the going was tough\nAnd now they know\nThat things don't seem so rough\nSo kids, stay in school\nDon't be no drag\nTake a fool's advise\nAnd stay out of that bag\n\n[Chorus]\nTell me one more time\nWhat he said\nWithout an education\nMight as well be dead\nYou got to, got to, got to, got to get some learning now\nWhat he said\nWithout an education\nMight as well be dead\n\n[Outro]\nDon't be a dropout, stay in school now listen to me\nWhat he said\nKids, kids\nMight as well be dead\nNo, no\nWhat he said\nWithout an education\nMight as well be deadEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

But you know, they didn't get here by themselves. It's been a long road and it's taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, they're like mystery stories, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they're on the fringes now. And they sound like they've been on the hard ground\n\nI should mention a few people along the way who brought this about. I know I should mention John Hammond, great talent scout for Columbia Records. He signed me to that label when I was nobody. It took a lot of faith to do that, and he took a lot of ridicule, but he was his own man and he was courageous. And for that, I'm eternally grateful. The last person he discovered before me was Aretha Franklin, and before that Count Basie, Billie Holiday and a whole lot of other artists. All noncommercial artists\n\nTrends did not interest John, and I was very noncommercial but he stayed with me. He believed in my talent and that's all that mattered. I can't thank him enough for that\n\nLou Levy runs Leeds Music, and they published my earliest songs, but I didn't stay there too long. Levy himself, he went back a long ways. He signed me to that company and recorded my songs and I sang them into a tape recorder. He told me outright, there was no precedent for what I was doing, that I was either before my time or behind it. And if I brought him a song like \"Stardust,\" he'd turn it down because it would be too late\n\nHe told me that if I was before my time -- and he didn't really know that for sure -- but if it was happening and if it was true, the public would usually take three to five years to catch up -- so be prepared. And that did happen. The trouble was, when the public did catch up I was already three to five years beyond that, so it kind of complicated it. But he was encouraging, and he didn't judge me, and I'll always remember him for that\n\nArtie Mogull at Witmark Music signed me next to his company, and he told me to just keep writing songs no matter what, that I might be on to something. Well, he too stood behind me, and he could never wait to see what I'd give him next. I didn't even think of myself as a songwriter before then. I'll always be grateful for him also for that attitude\nI also have to mention some of the early artists who recorded my songs very, very early, without having to be asked. Just something they felt about them that was right for them. I've got to say thank you to Peter, Paul and Mary, who I knew all separately before they ever became a group. I didn't even think of myself as writing songs for others to sing but it was starting to happen and it couldn't have happened to, or with, a better group\n\nThey took a song of mine that had been recorded before that was buried on one of my records and turned it into a hit song. Not the way I would have done it -- they straightened it out. But since then hundreds of people have recorded it and I don't think that would have happened if it wasn't for them. They definitely started something for me\n\nThe Byrds, the Turtles, Sonny & Cher -- they made some of my songs Top 10 hits but I wasn't a pop songwriter and I really didn't want to be that, but it was good that it happened. Their versions of songs were like commercials, but I didn't really mind that because 50 years later my songs were being used in the commercials. So that was good too. I was glad it happened, and I was glad they'd done it\n\nPervis Staples and the Staple Singers -- long before they were on Stax they were on Epic and they were one of my favorite groups of all time. I met them all in '62 or '63. They heard my songs live and Pervis wanted to record three or four of them and he did with the Staples Singers. They were the type of artists that I wanted recording my songs\n\nNina Simone. I used to cross paths with her in New York City in the Village Gate nightclub. These were the artists I looked up to. She recorded some of my songs that she [inaudible] to me. She was an overwhelming artist, piano player and singer. Very strong woman, very outspoken. That she was recording my songs validated everything that I was about\n\nOh, and can't forget Jimi Hendrix. I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform when he was in a band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames -- something like that. And Jimi didn't even sing. He was just the guitar player. He took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and pumped them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere and turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here\n\nJohnny Cash recorded some of my songs early on, too, up in about '63, when he was all skin and bones. He traveled long, he traveled hard, but he was a hero of mine. I heard many of his songs growing up. I knew them better than I knew my own. \"Big River,\" \"I Walk the Line.\"\n\n\"How high's the water, Mama?\" I wrote \"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\" with that song reverberating inside my head. I still ask, \"How high is the water, mama?\" Johnny was an intense character. And he saw that people were putting me down playing electric music, and he posted letters to magazines scolding people, telling them to shut up and let him sing\n\nIn Johnny Cash's world -- hardcore Southern drama -- that kind of thing didn't exist. Nobody told anybody what to sing or what not to sing. They just didn't do that kind of thing. I'm always going to thank him for that. Johnny Cash was a giant of a man, the man in black. And I'll always cherish the friendship we had until the day there is no more days\n\nOh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Joan Baez. She was the queen of folk music then and now. She took a liking to my songs and brought me with her to play concerts, where she had crowds of thousands of people enthralled with her beauty and voice\n\nPeople would say, \"What are you doing with that ragtag scrubby little waif?\" And she'd tell everybody in no uncertain terms, \"Now you better be quiet and listen to the songs.\" We even played a few of them together. Joan Baez is as tough-minded as they come. Love. And she's a free, independent spirit. Nobody can tell her what to do if she doesn't want to do it. I learned a lot of things from her. A woman with devastating honesty. And for her kind of love and devotion, I could never pay that back\n\nLRelated Rare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface via eBay sale\nPOP & HISS\nRare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface via eBay sale\nSEE ALL RELATED\n8\nYou might also likeGRAMMYS 2015: Complete list | Show highlights | Quotes | Best & worst\n\nThe secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylan's new album\nThe secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylan's new album\nThese songs didn't come out of thin air. I didn't just make them up out of whole cloth. Contrary to what Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional music: traditional folk music, traditional rock 'n' roll and traditional big-band swing orchestra music\n\nI learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them back when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me the code for everything that's fair game, that everything belongs to everyone\n\nFor three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses, fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one  song and sing it next in an hour if I'd heard it just once\n\n\nIf you sang \"John Henry\" as many times as me -- \"John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer in his hand / John Henry said a man ain't nothin' but a man / Before I let that steam drill drive me down / I'll die with that hammer in my hand.\"\n\nIf you had sung that song as many times as I did, you'd have written \"How many roads must a man walk down?\" too\n\nBig Bill Broonzy had a song called \"Key to the Highway.\" \"I've got a key to the highway / I'm booked and I'm bound to go / Gonna leave here runnin' because walking is most too slow.\" I sang that a lot. If you sing that a lot, you just might write\n\nGeorgia Sam he had a bloody nose\n\nWelfare Department they wouldn\u2019t give him no clothes\n\nHe asked poor Howard where can I go\n\nHoward said there\u2019s only one place I know\n\nSam said tell me quick man I got to run\nHoward just pointed with his gun\nAnd said that way down on Highway 61\n\nYou'd have written that too if you'd sang \"Key to the Highway\" as much as me\n\n\"Ain't no use sit 'n cry / You'll be an angel by and by / Sail away, ladies, sail away.\" \"I'm sailing away my own true love.\" \"Boots of Spanish Leather\" -- Sheryl Crow just sung that\n\n\"Roll the cotton down, aw, yeah, roll the cotton down / Ten dollars a day is a white man's pay / A dollar a day is the black man's pay / Roll the cotton down.\" If you sang that song as many times as me, you'd be writing \"I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,\" too\nI sang a lot of \"come all you\" songs. There's plenty of them. There's way too  many to be counted. \"Come along boys and listen to my tale / Tell you of my trouble on the old Chisholm Trail.\" Or, \"Come all ye good people, listen while I tell / the fate of Floyd Collins a lad we all know well / The fate of Floyd Collins, a lad we all know well.\"\n\n\"Come all ye fair and tender ladies / Take warning how you court your men / They're like a star on a summer morning / They first appear and then they're gone again.\" \"If you'll gather 'round, people / A story I will tell /  'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw / Oklahoma knew him well.\"\n\nIf you sung all these \"come all ye\" songs all the time, you'd be writing, \"Come gather 'round people where ever you roam, admit that the waters around you have grown / Accept that soon you'll be drenched to the bone / If your time to you is worth saving / And you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone / The times they are a-changing.\"\n\nYou'd have written them too. There's nothing secret about it. You just do it subliminally and unconsciously, because that's all enough, and that's all I sang. That was all that was dear to me. They were the only kinds of songs that made sense\n\n\"When you go down to Deep Ellum keep your money in your socks / Women in Deep Ellum put you on the rocks.\" Sing that song for a while and you just might come up with, \"When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too / And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through / Don\u2019t put on any airs / When you\u2019re down on Rue Morgue Avenue / They got some hungry women there / And they really make a mess outta you.\"\n\nAll these songs are connected. Don't be fooled. I just opened up a different door in a different kind of way. It's just different, saying the same thing. I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary\n\nWell you know, I just thought I was doing something natural, but right from the start, my songs were divisive for some reason. They divided people. I never knew why. Some got angered, others loved them. Didn't know why my songs had detractors and supporters. A strange environment to have to throw your songs into, but I did it anyway\n\nLast thing I thought of was who cared about what song I was writing. I was just writing them. I didn't think I was doing anything different. I thought I was just extending the line. Maybe a little bit unruly, but I was just elaborating on situations. Maybe hard to pin down, but so what? A lot of people are hard to pin down. You've just got to bear it. I didn't really care what Lieber and Stoller thought of my songs\n\nThey didn't like 'em, but Doc Pomus did. That was all right that they didn't like 'em, because I never liked their songs either. \"Yakety yak, don't talk back.\" \"Charlie Brown is a clown,\" \"Baby I'm a hog for you.\" Novelty songs. They weren't saying anything serious. Doc's songs, they were better. \"This Magic Moment.\" \"Lonely Avenue.\" Save the Last Dance for Me\n\nThose songs broke my heart. I figured I'd rather have his blessings any day than theirs\n\nAhmet Ertegun didn't think much of my songs, but Sam Phillips did. Ahmet founded Atlantic Records. He produced some great records: Ray Charles, Ray Brown, just to name a few\n\nThere were some great records in there, no question about it. But Sam Phillips, he recorded Elvis and Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Radical eyes that shook the very essence of humanity. Revolution in style and scope. Heavy shape and color. Radical to the bone. Songs that cut you to the bone. Renegades in all degrees, doing songs that would never decay, and still resound to this day. Oh, yeah, I'd rather have Sam Phillips' blessing any day\n\nMerle Haggard didn't even think much of my songs. I know he didn't. He didn't say that to me, but I know [inaudible]. Buck Owens did, and he recorded some of my early songs. Merle Haggard -- \"Mama Tried,\" \"The Bottle Let Me Down,\" \"I'm a Lonesome Fugitive.\" I can't imagine Waylon Jennings singing \"The Bottle Let Me Down.\"\n\n\"Together Again\"? That's Buck Owens, and that trumps anything coming out of Bakersfield. Buck Owens and Merle Haggard? If you have to have somebody's blessing -- you figure it out\n\nOh, yeah. Critics have been giving me a hard time since Day One. Critics say I can't sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why don't critics say that same thing about Tom Waits? Critics say my voice is shot. That I have no voice. What don't they say those things about Leonard Cohen? Why do I get special treatment? Critics say I can't carry a tune and I talk my way through a song. Really? I've never heard that said about Lou Reed. Why does he get to go scot-free?\n\nYep. A more gracious way to lament or \"woe is me\" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...\n\nWhat have I done to deserve this special attention? No vocal range? When's the last time you heard Dr. John? Why don't you say that about him? Slur my words, got no diction. Have you people ever listened to Charley Patton or Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters. Talk about slurred words and no diction. [Inaudible] doesn't even matter\n\n\"Why me, Lord?\" I would say that to myself\n\nCritics say I mangle my melodies, render my songs unrecognizable. Oh, really? Let me tell you something. I was at a boxing match a few years ago seeing Floyd Mayweather fight a Puerto Rican guy. And the Puerto Rican national anthem, somebody sang it and it was beautiful. It was heartfelt and it was moving\n\nAfter that it was time for our national anthem. And a very popular soul-singing sister was chosen to sing. She sang every note -- that exists, and some that don't exist. Talk about mangling a melody. You take a one-syllable word and make it last for 15 minutes? She was doing vocal gymnastics like she was on a trapeze act. But to me it was not funny\n\nWhere were the critics? Mangling lyrics? Mangling a melody? Mangling a treasured song? No, I get the blame. But I don't really think I do that. I just think critics say I do\n\nSam Cooke said this when told he had a beautiful voice: He said, \"Well that's very kind of you, but voices ought not to be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter only if they convince you that they are telling the truth.\" Think about that the next time you [inaudible]\n\nTimes always change. They really do. And you have to always be ready for something that's coming along and you never expected it. Way back when, I was in Nashville making some records and I read this article, a Tom T. Hall interview. Tom T. Hall, he was bitching about some kind of new song, and he couldn't understand what these new kinds of songs that were coming in were about\n\nNow Tom, he was one of the most preeminent songwriters of the time in Nashville. A lot of people were recording his songs and he himself even did it. But he was all in a fuss about James Taylor, a song James had called \"Country Road.\" Tom was going off in this  interview -- \"But James don't say nothing about a country road. He's just says how you can feel it on the country road. I don't understand that.\"\n\nNow some might say Tom is a great songwriter. I'm not going to doubt that. At the time he was doing this interview I was actually listening to a song of his on the radio\n\nIt was called \"I Love.\" I was listening to it in a recording studio, and he was talking about all the things he loves, an everyman kind of song, trying to connect with people. Trying to make you think that he's just like you and you're just like him. We all love the same things, and we're all in this together. Tom loves little baby ducks, slow-moving trains and rain. He loves old pickup trucks and little country streams. Sleeping without dreams. Bourbon in a glass. Coffee in a cup. Tomatoes on the vine, and onions\nNow listen, I'm not ever going to disparage another songwriter. I'm not going to do that. I'm not saying it's a bad song. I'm just saying it might be a little overcooked. But, you know, it was in the top 10 anyway. Tom and a few other writers had the whole Nashville scene sewed up in a box. If you wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go to them, and Tom was one of the top guys. They were all very comfortable, doing their thing\n\nThis was about the time that Willie Nelson picked up and moved to Texas. About the same time. He's still in Texas. Everything was very copacetic. Everything was all right until -- until -- Kristofferson came to town. Oh, they ain't seen anybody like him. He came into town like a wildcat, flew his helicopter into Johnny Cash's backyard like a typical songwriter. And he went for the throat. \"Sunday Morning Coming Down.\"\n\nWell, I woke up Sunday morning\n\nGrammys 2014: MusiCares gala celebrates the music of Carole King\nGrammys 2014: MusiCares gala celebrates the music of Carole King\nWith no way to hold my head that didn't hurt\n\nAnd the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad\n\nSo I had one more for dessert\n\nThen I fumbled through my closet\n\nFound my cleanest dirty shirt\n\nThen I washed my face and combed my hair\n\nAnd stumbled down the stairs to meet the day\n\nYou can look at Nashville pre-Kris and post-Kris, because he changed everything. That one song ruined Tom T. Hall's poker parties. It might have sent him to the crazy house. God forbid he ever heard any of my songs\n\nYou walk into the room\n\nWith your pencil in your hand\n\nYou see somebody naked\n\nYou say, \u201cWho is that man?\u201d\n\nYou try so hard\n\nBut you don\u2019t understand\n\nJust what you're gonna say\n\nWhen you get home\n\nYou know something is happening here\n\nBut you don\u2019t know what it is\n\nLRelated Rare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface via eBay sale\nPOP & HISS\nRare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface via eBay sale\nSEE ALL RELATED\n8\n\nDo you, Mister Jones?\n\nIf \"Sunday Morning Coming Down\" rattled Tom's cage, sent him into the looney bin, my song surely would have made him blow his brains out, right there in the minivan. Hopefully he didn't hear it\n\nI just released an album of standards, all the songs usually done by Michael Buble, Harry Connick Jr., maybe Brian Wilson's done a couple, Linda Ronstadt done 'em. But the reviews of their records are different than the reviews of my record\n\nIn their reviews no one says anything. In my reviews, [inaudible] they've got to look under every stone when it comes to me. They've got to mention all the songwriters' names. Well that's OK with me. After all, they're great songwriters and these are standards. I've seen the reviews come in, and they'll mention all the songwriters in half the review, as if everybody knows them. Nobody's heard of them, not in this time, anyway. Buddy Kaye, Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh, to name a few\n\nCComments\n@studiocity2 Yep. A more gracious way to lament or \"woe is me\" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...\nRICHARDOVICH\nAT 1:43 PM FEBRUARY 09, 2015\nADD A COMMENTSEE ALL COMMENTS\n45\n\nBut, you know, I'm glad they mention their names, and you know what? I'm glad they got their names in the press. It might have taken some time to do it, but they're finally there. I can only wonder why it took so long. My only regret is that they're not here to see it\n\nTraditional rock 'n' roll, we're talking about that. It's all about rhythm. Johnny Cash said it best: \"Get rhythm. Get rhythm when you get the blues.\" Very few rock 'n' roll bands today play with rhythm. They don't know what it is. Rock 'n' roll is a combination of blues, and it's a strange thing made up of two parts. A lot of people don't know this, but the blues, which is an American music, is not what you think it is. It's a combination of Arabic violins and Strauss waltzes working it out. But it's true\n\n\nThe other half of rock 'n' roll has got to be hillbilly. And that's a derogatory term, but it ought not to be. That's a term that includes the Delmore Bros., Stanley Bros., Roscoe Holcomb, Clarence Ashley ... groups like that. Moonshiners gone berserk. Fast cars on dirt roads. That's the kind of combination that makes up rock 'n' roll, and it can't be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio\n\nYou have to have the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music. If you can't hardly play the blues, how do you [inaudible] those other two kinds of music in there? You can fake it, but you can't really do it\n\nCritics have made a career out of accusing me of having a career of confounding expectations. Really? Because that's all I do. That's how I think about it. Confounding expectations\n\n\"What do you do for a living, man?\"\n\n\"Oh, I confound expectations.\"\n\nYou're going to get a job, the man says, \"What do you do?\" \"Oh, confound expectations.: And the man says, \"Well, we already have that spot filled. Call us back. Or don't call us, we'll call you.\" Confounding expectations. What does that mean? 'Why me, Lord? I'd confound them, but I don't know how to do it.'\n\nThe Blackwood Bros. have been talking to me about making a record together. That might confound expectations, but it shouldn't. Of course it would be a gospel album. I don't think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me. Not a bit. One of the songs I'm thinking about singing is \"Stand By Me\" by the Blackwood Brothers. Not \"Stand By Me\" the pop song. No. The real \"Stand By Me.\"\n\nThe real one goes like this:\n\nWhen the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the world is tossing me / Like a ship upon the sea / Thou who rulest wind and water / Stand by me\n\nIn the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / When the hosts of hell assail / And my strength begins to fail / Thou who never lost a battle / Stand by me\n\nIn the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / When I do the best I can / And my friends don't understand / Thou who knowest all about  me / Stand by me\n\nThat's the song. I like it better than the pop song. If I record one by that name, that's going to be the one. I'm also thinking of recording a song, not on that album, though: \"Oh Lord, Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.\"\n\nAnyway, why me, Lord. What did I do?\n\nAnyway, I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I'm honored to have all these artists singing my songs. There's nothing like that. Great artists. [applause, inaudible]. They're all singing the truth, and you can hear it in their voices\n\nI'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I think a lot of this organization. They've helped many people. Many musicians who have contributed a lot to our culture. I'd like to personally thank them for what they did for a friend of mine, Billy Lee Riley. A friend of mine who they helped for six years when he was down and couldn't work. Billy was a son of rock 'n' roll, obviously\n\n\nHe was a true original. He did it all: He played, he sang, he wrote. He would have been a bigger star but Jerry Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that comes along. You just don't stand a chance\n\nSo Billy became what is known in the industry -- a condescending term, by the way -- as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, once in a while, a one-hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star who's got 20 or 30 hits behind him. And Billy's hit song was called \"Red Hot,\" and it was red hot. It could blast you out of your skull and make you feel happy about it. Change your life\n\nHe did it with style and grace. You won't find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He's not there. Metallica is. Abba is. Mamas and the Papas -- I know they're in there. Jefferson Airplane, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan -- I've got nothing against them. Soft rock, hard rock, psychedelic pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff, but after all, it is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there. Yet\n\nI'd see him a couple times a year and we'd always spent time together and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit, and we'd cross paths now and again. We'd always spend time together. He was a hero of mine. I'd heard \"Red Hot.\" I must have been only 15 or 16 when I did and it's impressed me to this day\n\nYep. A more gracious way to lament or \"woe is me\" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...\n\nI never grow tired of listening to it. Never got tired of watching Billy Lee perform, either. We spent time together just talking and playing into the night. He was a deep, truthful man. He wasn't bitter or nostalgic. He just accepted it. He knew where he had come from and he was content with who he was\n\nAnd then one day he got sick. And like my friend John Mellencamp would sing -- because John sang some truth today -- one day you get sick and you don't get better. That's from a song of his called \"Life is Short Even on Its Longest Days.\" It's one of the better songs of the last few years, actually. I ain't lying\n\nAnd I ain't lying when I tell you that MusiCares paid for my friend's doctor bills, and helped him to get spending money. They were able to at least make his life comfortable, tolerable to the end. That is something that can't be repaid. Any organization that would do that would have to have my blessing\n\nI'm going to get out of here now. I'm going to put an egg in my shoe and beat it. I probably left out a lot of people and said too much about some. But that's OK. Like the spiritual song, 'I'm still just crossing over Jordan too.' Let's hope we meet again. Sometime. And we will, if, like Hank Williams said, \"the good Lord willing and the creek don't rise.\"1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/5977541", "artist_names": "Shelby Flint", "full_title": "Cast Your Fate To The Wind by\u00a0Shelby\u00a0Flint", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e1beb504839f7209e5e4afe420559895.298x298x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e1beb504839f7209e5e4afe420559895.298x298x1.jpg", "id": 5977541, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 8534, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1600476416, "path": "/Shelby-flint-cast-your-fate-to-the-wind-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Shelby-flint-cast-your-fate-to-the-wind-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1966, "month": 7, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "July 1966", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jul. 1966", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e1beb504839f7209e5e4afe420559895.298x298x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e1beb504839f7209e5e4afe420559895.298x298x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Cast Your Fate To The Wind", "title_with_featured": "Cast Your Fate To The Wind", "updated_by_human_at": 1600476416, "url": "https://genius.com/Shelby-flint-cast-your-fate-to-the-wind-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/378068", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/cfcada20fd6a36bdd10807da32fdaa6f.731x731x1.jpg", "id": 378068, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/cfcada20fd6a36bdd10807da32fdaa6f.731x731x1.jpg", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Shelby Flint", "slug": "Shelby-flint", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Shelby-flint"}, "artist": "Shelby Flint", "lyrics": "Cast Your Fate To The Wind Lyrics[Verse 1]\nA month of nights, a year of days\nOctobers drifting into Mays\nI set my sail as the tide comes in\nI just cast my fate to the wind\n\n[Verse 2]\nI shift my course along the breeze\nWon't sail upwind on memories\nThe empty sky is my best friend\nAnd I just cast my fate to the wind\n[Verse 3]\nThe month of nights, a year of days\nOctobers drifting into Mays\nI set my sail and the tide comes in\nI just cast my fate to the windYou might also likeEmbed"}]
