blue, when I'm lonely\nShe comes through, she's the only one who can\nMy baby grand is all I need\n\n[Verse 2: Ray Charles]\nIn my time, I've wandered everywhere\nAround this world, she would always be there\nAny day, any hour\nAll it takes is the power in my hands\nThis baby grand's been good to me\n[Chorus: Billy Joel & Ray Charles]\nI've had friends, but they slipped away\nAnd I've had fame, but it doesn't stay\nI've made fortunes, I spent them fast enough\nBut as for women, they don't lust with just one man\nBut my baby grand is gonna stand by me\n\n[Verse 3: Billy Joel & Ray Charles]\nThey say that no one's gonna play this on the radio\nWhy, I don't believe that\nThey said the melancholy blues were dead and gone\nBut only songs like these played in minor keys\nKeep those memories holding on\n\n[Chorus: Billy Joel & Ray Charles]\nI've come far from the life I strayed in\nAnd I've got the scars from those dives I played in\nNow I'm home, and I'm weary\nAnd in my bones, every dreary one night stand\nMy baby grand is coming home with me\nWith me\n\n[Outro: Billy Joel]\nBut ever since this gig began\nMy baby grand's been good to meSee Billy Joel LiveGet tickets as low

the highway\nThrough the cradle of the Civil War\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm going to Graceland, Graceland\nMemphis, Tennessee, I'm going to Graceland\nPoor boys and pilgrims with families\nAnd we are going to Graceland\nMy traveling companion is nine years old\nHe is the child of my first marriage\nBut I've reason to believe\nWe both will be received in Graceland\n\n[Verse 2]\nShe comes back to tell me she's gone\nAs if I didn't know that\nAs if I didn't know my own bed\nAs if I'd never noticed\nThe way she brushed her hair from her forehead\nAnd she said losing love\nIs like a window in your heart\nEverybody sees you're blown apart\nEverybody sees the wind blow\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm going to Graceland\nMemphis, Tennessee, I'm going to Graceland\nPoor boys and pilgrims with families\nAnd we are going to Graceland\n\nAnd my traveling companions are ghosts and empty sockets\nI'm looking at ghosts and empties\nBut I've reason to believe\nWe all will be received in Graceland\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nThere is a girl in New York City\nWho calls herself the human trampoline\nAnd sometimes when I'm falling, flying\nOr tumbling in turmoil I say\n\"Whoa, so this is what she means\"\nShe means we're bouncing into Graceland\nAnd I see losing love\nIs like a window in your heart\nWell, everybody sees you're blown apart\nEverybody feels the wind blow\n\n[Chorus]\nOoh\nIn Graceland, Graceland\nI'm going to Graceland\nFor reasons I cannot explain\nThere's some part of me wants to see Graceland\nAnd I may be obliged to defend\nEvery love, every ending\nOr maybe there's no obligations now\nMaybe I've a reason to believe\nWe all will be received in Graceland\n\n[Break]\n(Ooh)\n[Chorus]\nWoah\nIn Graceland, Graceland, Graceland\nI'm going to Graceland\n\n[Instrumental

her neck\nIn the shape of a heart\nIn the shape of a heart\nIt was a time I won't forget\nFor the sorrow and regret\nAnd the shape of a heart\nAnd the shape of a heart\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI guess I never knew\nWhat she was talking about\nI guess I never knew\nWhat she was living without\n[Chorus]\nPeople speak of love don't know what they're thinking of\nWait around for the one who fits just like a glove\nSpeak in terms of belief and belonging\nTry to fit some name to their longing\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere was a hole left in the wall\nFrom some ancient fight\nAbout the size of a fist\nOr something thrown that had missed\nAnd there were other holes as well\nIn the house where our nights fell\nFar too many to repair\nIn the time that we were there\n\n[Chorus]\nPeople speak of love don't know what they're thinking of\nReach out to each other through the push and shove\nSpeak in terms of a life and the learning\nTry to think of a word for the burning\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou keep it up\nYou try so hard\nTo keep a life from coming apart\nAnd never know\nWhat breaches and faults are concealed\nIn the shape of a heart\nIn the shape of a heart\nIn the shape of a heart\nSee Jackson Browne LiveGet

while\nAnd dropped it into the wall\nI let it go and heard it fall\n(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI guess I never knew\nWhat she was talking about\nI guess I never knew\nWhat she was living without\n\n[Chorus]\nPeople speak of love don't know what they're thinking of\nWait around for the one who fits just like a glove\nSpeak in terms of a life and the living\nTry to find the word for forgiving (Oh)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou keep it up\nYou try so hard\nTo keep a life from coming apart\nAnd never know\nThe shallows and the unseen reefs\nThat are there from the start\nIn the shape of a

It's like a mystery to me\nFirst thing's, for sure I damn well know\nRappers be all about skills, but forgot about the funk flow\nDon't get wrong, skills are great!\nBut yo, I haven't bought a rap record since 1988\nSo like El DeBarge, I \"turn the page\"\nRevamp the chapters dating back to hip hop's golden age\nI strove the archives and revive the art\nCuz I can only feel the real with sparked from the heart\nOur principles give presence to the essence of rap\nMy mic technique's, bada-bing boom-bap!\nA bragadocious metaphor conglomeration\nHardcore beats, loop & troop to form a whole new creation\nStick to my guns, kick the genuine rhymes\nTaking desperate times, to withstand desperate times\n[Chorus: Skinslaya]\nJealousy, lies and deceit\nStep to me with that shit, it's an instant ass beat\nYou can't do shit, if you can't stick together\nDesperate times, for desperate fuckin measures\n\n[Blakspik]\nWho be them cats talking that ra ra shit\nWith all that blasphemous talk they need to step to the left\nThere's no more real rap just fake cats with fake raps\nActin'' refined but in the dark they eatin the swine\nSo who's the killer now with mad body counts\nIt's cool to smoke wools cop dope and act like a fool\nBut I don't carry no burners to look rough\nOr smoke no la la so I can look tough\nI just maintain like them old school brothers do\nRap is slippin' so whos the A and R trippin'\nThis is the sounds that we created\nTranslated from true to life scenes, verbally stated\nSo call the cavalry cause we's about to go to war\nAnd get your wig split my crew is kind of desperate\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Infamous Mr. Savage] (Storm Da Ghetto Mutant)\nNineteen ninety somethin\nThe year of the studio gangsta fakin and frontin\nIt's open season on you bitch rappers im goin huntin'\nIt's war between real hip-hop and rap\nWreck shop or wack, fist fights and carry gats\nMy mind reacts to notes upon the track\nThat take me back to 1988 when the scene was fat\nNowadays you got these little ass niggas actin like they\nBigger fakin on triggers, it all look good in pictures\nWhich which is which that kid who shoots his lip\nBut in the face of beef switch up turns bitch (And changes pitch!)\nThe apocalypse for style biters and criminals\nStop suckin' the next man's dick and be original\nFollowing trends the agenda of a beginner\nHeard Wu-Tang Clan now everybody is a five percenter\nDisrespectable non intellectual\nIt's desperate times kid guard that knot before I step to you!\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n\n[G-Clef Da Mad Komposa]\nHow can we keep our composure\nWhile all sorts of forces bought up our exposure?\nI showed ya, back in '95, we wasn't playing\nWhat we was saying, reorganize with no delaying!\nLearn to use your head, got to be more careful\nRead between my lines, you might just catch an ear full of fear\nKnown for putting words up in a tear!\nInvisible Army, so don't ya try and bomb me I swear!\nWord is bond, till death do us part\nDon't start with this mystic tribe of jewelers!\nI grill your physical form on my Hibachi\nYour bones can't stop me, they're mummified in Versace\nAnd Gucci, ya'll ain't butt, ya'll is pucchie\nHeed this sacred text, not to be taken loosely\nHomo-not-genius, homogenous genocidist\nFake insiders that incite us, and invite us to recite this\nI lure 'em into my trap, now I know they're

you happen to see\nIt will happen to be\nNothing happens to nowhere and nowhere\nYou can fool yourself\nYou can cheat until you're blind\nIt can happen to me\nYou can cut your heart\nIt can happen to everyone eventually\nAs you happen to say\nIt can happen today\nAs it happens It happens in every way\nYou can mend the wires\nYou can feed the soul apart\nYou can touch your life\nYou can bring your soul alive\n\nIt can happen to you\nIt can happen to me\nIt can happen to everyone eventually\nAs you happen to say\nIt can happen today\nAs it happens it happens in every wayEmbed"}, {"_type":

Moment of Truth Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWhen you're alone, you ask yourself, what are you searching for?\nDeep in the night, a\u2005dream\u2005is born, one\u2005that you can't ignore\nIf you think\u2005you can find the passion and you're ready to take\u205fa\u205fchance\nIf\u205fyou really believe\u205fyou can make\u205fit, then the power is in your own hands\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's the moment of truth, you're giving it all\nStanding alone, willing to fall\nIf you can do it, get up and prove it, get up and show them who you are\nIt's the moment of truth, it's all on the line\nThis is the place, this is the time\nYou've waited forever, it's now or it's never, nothing can stop you now\n[Verse 2]\nOnce in your life, you make a choice, ready to risk it all\nDeep in your soul, you hear a voice answering to the call\nThough you know that it won't be easy, it's a promise you made for love\nFor the people that keep believing and the one that you're thinking of\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's the moment of truth, you're giving it all\nStanding alone, willing to fall\nIf you can do it, get up and prove it, get up and show them who you are\nIt's the moment of truth, it's all on the line\nThis is the place, this is the time\nYou've waited forever, it's now or it's never, nothing can stop you now\nIt's the moment of truth, you're giving it all\nStanding alone, willing to fall\nIf you can do it, get up and prove it, get up and show them who you are\nIt's the moment of truth, it's all on the line\nThis is the place, this is the time\nYou've waited forever, it's now or it's never, nothing can stop you now\nIt's the moment of truth, you're giving it all\nStanding alone, willing to fall\nIf you can do it, get up and prove it, get up and show them who you are\nIt's the moment of truth, it's all on

others, all the time\n\nYou must rise to her defense when she's in danger\nTurn around and you're looking at a stranger\nShe steals your savings from under your bed\nAnd leads you into places even angels fear to tread\nShe's a blue light\nShe's not amused, when you're trying to upstage her\nSo you choose to do nothing to enrage her\n'Cause under her mantle you feel safe from the cold\nAnd you're safe from the danger of ever growing old\nShe's a blue light\n\n\"I'll never forget this foggy sort of thing but, uh, sometimes when the inspiration strikes I can get down with the best of

winnin'\nSwingin' for the bleachers in the ninth inning\nStill taking chances\nBefore chances take me away\nBefore chances take me away\nMaybe I should have thought it over when you said, \"Will you join me later?\"\n\nI said, Honey I don't know if it's right\nBut when you turned and walked down the street, I followed\nI felt like I was following a truckload of dynamite\n\nStill taking chances\nTaking candy from strangers\nSpeedin' up on curves\nIgnoring the dangers\nFeel like a fool learning new dances\nIt keeps me on my toes\nStill taking chances\nAin't scared of winnin'\nSwingin' for the bleachers in the ninth inning\nStill taking chances\nBefore chances take me away\nBefore chances take me away\n\nBeen three years now since we got together\nYou took a chance on me\nNow I'm out here taking chances for you\nI'll get through\n\nStill taking chances\nTaking candy from strangers\nSpeedin' up on curves\nIgnoring the dangers\nFeel like a fool learning new dances\nIt keeps me on my toes\nStill taking chances\nAin't scared of winnin'\nSwingin' for the bleachers in the ninth inning\nStill taking chances\nBefore chances take me away\nBefore chances take me away\nYou might also likeI'm still taking chances\nBefore they take me away\nTake me away\nTake me away\nGive me a chance now, darlin'\nYeah, I'm still taking chances\nStill taking chances\nStill taking

"Benedict Smith", "lyrics": "Incarnadine LyricsIncarnadine\n\nWhen someone takes a bullet to the head, from a distance, it creates a cloud of blood. They call it a pink mist, and it\u2019s quite beautiful, really, like a little cosmos. A cotton-candy cosmos. A lot more beautiful than me, I know. I think I\u2019d be better as a pink mist. Religious symbolism tries to make blood redemptive, or unhygienic, or sexual, or the home of the soul. But blood is indifferent. Blood is blood. It pumps until it doesn\u2019t.\n\nThe supermarket is hot and clotted with people. I\u2019ve forgotten to put on deodorant. I\u2019m tired of waiting in line; the Christmas songs make my blood boil. And the adverts. Buy this, and this, and this, or you\u2019ll die alone. I fantasise about being bound up with tinsel and thrown into a wood chipper. Then I wonder why I\u2019d need to be bound up for that. My scalp feels itchy. I worry that I\u2019m ugly. Each new day a gash. Finally, the queue flows.\n\nI sit my basket down. The girl behind the counter has curly hair and freckles, and big brown eyes, and the kind of facial symmetry I\u2019ve been programmed to find aesthetically pleasing. My chest feels tight, my cheeks flush.\n\n'You alright?' she asks, looking down as she scans my black pudding, my heart beating with the boops of her barcode reader. I feel the words crawling up my trachea, oozing up as blood, filling my mouth. It leaks out of tight lips in drips, then dribbles, drizzles, trickles onto the till, onto my dress.\n\n'Pmhgleelghmp - I\u2019m okay,' I squelch, holding my rib cage and wheezing as pints and pints pour out of me onto the counter. Has she noticed?\n'That\u2019s \u00a34.20, please.'\n\nI drop the rusty coins into her palm, grab my shopping and scurry away, vomiting uncontrollably. I know it\u2019s inevitable, but it still disappoints me every time. Like getting to the end of a packet of biscuits, or watching your parents fall out of love. It's happened since I was a little girl. When I wasn\u2019t a dinosaur or a vampire, I was in therapy. Some days I could sit in the corner and waterlog the whole playground with blood.\n\nI wonder if I\u2019m the only one who falls in love with complete strangers. It must mean I\u2019m desperate for love. No. Everyone wants someone to turn to them and say, \u201cYou are disgusting, but enchanting. You are not a freak. You are a beautiful sack of shit and I will love you in spite of everything.\u201d Everyone wants to feel connected.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s enough to know we\u2019re connected through spooky action. That\u2019s what Albert Einstein called it, the way all of our particles are connected and entangled, even when light years apart - \u201cspooky action at a distance\u201d. But I don\u2019t feel connected, not even spookily. The nights I cry are, of course, the best. But mostly I just feel very, very alone. Just talking to people or being around them, washing up, doing the laundry, showering, getting dressed. It\u2019s all so exhausting. My eyes are sore from staring at plasma screens all day.\n\nNosferatu\u2019s on telly. I glug down some of Mum\u2019s wine. This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you. The days are getting so short. It is dark and I flicker on and off. When I look in the mirror I hate what I see. My belly spills over my jeans and I can barely look myself in the face. I do not want a body. There is a language of the body, and it is foreign to me. I live in constant fear that I might be misinterpreted in the folding of arms, the darting of eyes, or a yawn.\n\nWhen I was ten, almost five years ago now, I asked my Dad how much it\u2019d hurt to slit my throat. A lot, he said. It would hurt everyone who loved me. I can\u2019t do that to them, we\u2019re blood. I need a way of killing my self without killing myself. I will create a machine through which I can live vicariously. A vessel for self-expression. I don\u2019t want to call xem an \u2018it\u2019, but xe won\u2019t be a he or a she, so I will use gender-neutral pronouns. Xe, xem, xyrs. Xe will always tell the truth. There is enough bullshit in circulation already. Xe will be a good person. Xyrs words will carry no blood.\n\n***\n\nIt took me a while because I had to do it all after school, but it isn\u2019t difficult to create a basic humanoid machine; it\u2019s simple programming, zeroes and ones. It\u2019s more the finer details: Sweat. Pus. Fat. Eye mucus. Ear wax. A whiskery grey beard, fluorescent tights. And a couple pounds of shit for that gorgeous tractus digestorius, mouth to anus. Couple liters of gastric juice. The phlegm, and the shame, dollops of shame. A sack of piss. A darling little spinal cord. Salt. And a trillion bacteria ready to eat xem when xe dies. And then you design the most beautiful skin only to have it rot away. But xe will have to die. I can\u2019t make xem live forever; that would be cruel. Oh, and the eyes. How could I forget the eyes? For the longest time xe\u2019s been staring at me through hollow sockets. And blood. All beauty comes from beautiful blood and a beautiful brain. Yes, and blood vessels, sixty-thousand miles of them. I\u2019ve read that the first man to describe in detail the properties of blood, in 1628, was an insomniac who hung out in caves because he liked the dark. William Harvey. I like William Harvey. He liked literature and birds, and so do I. I'm a mother bird when I vomit blood down xyrs throat. I\u2019m using hemerythrin from sea worms just to make it, or else it won\u2019t carry oxygen. And I\u2019ve had to knit the whole pathetic mess together with such tiny needles.\n\nMum knocks. I scramble for the speakers and swiftly turn my music off.\n\n\u2018Ez! Ez! Eztli!\u2019 she shouts.\n\n\u2018Yes, mum?!\u2019 I call back, draping a duvet over my machine, laying it down on my bed. I kick the piles of laundry, broken clothes hangers, chocolate wrappers, empty bottles and my dildo into the wardrobe. The door swings open.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s blood everywhere, Eztli\u2026 Were you trying to talk to someone?\u2019\n\n\u2018Just myself\u2019 I lie, heaving out more chunks of blood gunk.\n\u2018Poor girl\u2019 she coos, looking as though she wants to comfort me, but, slightly repulsed, she shuffles toward the door. Stops for a moment. Turns.\n\n\u2018Have you made your bed?\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m doing it now,\u2019 I spurt dysphorically as it fills my mouth and seeps out of my nostrils. I place myself between her and xem, \u2018I\u2019m busy, Mum.\u2019\n\nShe glazes over. \u2018Okay. Well we\u2019ll see you at dinner. You ought to go outside more. Be active. I don\u2019t like you being idle, Eztli\u2026\u2019 she trails off, the door closes. I do love her. I can\u2019t stand to think how much she must have sacrificed for me. Even financially speaking, fourteen years of childcare, and still more to go. It made me ill with guilt. Just imagining that amount of money. Blood money. However much it was, I was not worth it. I should have asked her for a hug. Now I\u2019m alone. Again. The multitudinous seas incarnadine. Bummed the fuck out. I think therefore I am. I think, therefore that\u2019s one bad habit I should probably give up.\n\n***\n\nI wake up unsure if I can make it out of bed. The thought of it hurts. Even something small like brushing my teeth. Rolling out of bed, crawling to the bathroom, squeezing the toothpaste onto the brush, brushing it back and forth, spitting it out. I know it\u2019s completely ludicrous, but I hurt too much to do it. Eventually I do, of course. I have no choice. But, still, it puzzles me. I\u2019ll never trace it to its source. Maybe some genetic vulnerability, maybe some traumatic event I\u2019ve repressed beyond retrieval. I would never know. I could not snap out of it. If I could, I would.\n\nOn the way to school I think I see a vulture, but it can\u2019t be a vulture. Not really. None of the pretty girls I like have texted me back. I\u2019m not very good at that stuff anyway. It isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t enjoy talking to people, I just hate small talk. I don\u2019t want to talk about your holiday plans or your body clock or your bowel movements. I don\u2019t care. Pretending to care drains me. I want to know what keeps you up at night. It is unusually sunny. The birds chirp incessantly, as though they\u2019re happy to be alive, or they just need to be heard. For some reason it occurs to me that if they wanted to, they could quite easily peck me to death.\n\nI\u2019ve read that a psychiatric disorder called the glass delusion was recorded in the late Middle Ages, even King Charles VI of France had it. The sufferer becomes so convinced their body is made of glass that they refuse to have anyone come near them, lest they be shattered into pieces. Sometimes I feel as though I\u2019m made of glass. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have brought xem into a world with such suffering, with us murky people made of glass, eating the same things, going to the same places, numbing ourselves in one-bedroom flats, wondering if we can drop our disguises, mamihlapinatapai, munging, avoiding the inner monster, ignoring the helpless, searching for meaning, sucking effluvia out of each other\u2019s arseholes with straws.\n\nOn the way home a gorgeous, curvy girl approaches me, and in an undemanding tone asks: \u2018Excuse me, sorry to bother you, but do you believe in God?\n\n\u2018Erm, I\u2019m not closed off to it\u2026\u2019 I cough. Honestly speaking, I do not like the idea of being a slave to a celestial master, an all-seeing authority, especially one that fails to intervene in instances of unimaginable human suffering, but it\u2019s difficult to gurgle that through the blood.\n\n\u2018I understand, but, I just feel compelled to tell you this,\u2019 she says. \u2018I had a rough childhood. My home life was\u2026 Not good. I had no hope. And then I found God, and I just wanted to tell you how happy it made me feel. I think He wanted me to tell you that. I don\u2019t know what it means, but yeah\u2026\u2019 Then with a wide smile and an awkward wave she is gone, and I am overcome with an immense feeling of warmth. I wish I could have told her \u2018thank you\u2019. I wish I could have let her know.\n\nOnce I get back to the house I make pancakes for my little brother and we watch cartoons. He likes to arrange the chocolate buttons into smiley faces.\n\n\u2018Why are all the superheroes white, Ez?\u2019 he asks with a gloomy look.\n\u2018Well\u2026\u2019 I tell him. \u2018You know superheroes aren\u2019t real heroes. It\u2019s just fantasy. So it doesn\u2019t matter that they don\u2019t look like us. Real heroes are everyday guys. You could be the greatest hero of all.\u2019\n\nHe smiles.\n\nMum comes in and switches on the news. There are riots happening near where we live - looting. They are frenzied and hungry for things. It is a testament to good marketing. A little riot every now and then keeps things flavourful. We're supposed to be violent, or else we're only half alive. We're hunter-gatherers. Raised on the fear of holy genocide; plagues, floods, fire. We\u2019ve lost that spark. We\u2019re not violent enough anymore, we're only told we are. We've become passive. Most people die elderly in bed, it just isn\u2019t newsworthy.\n\nWhile xe bubbled and cooked I mainly read internet forums. There were so many incredible specimens out there. People, I mean. People who think they\u2019re wizards, or lizards. Who shit in diapers for the pleasure. Who anthropomorphise \u2013 erotically. Who cyberfuck in character as Bilbo and Gollum. Who want to be tentacled hard in every orifice by a monstrous octopus. Who download snuff films. Who seduce people into starving themselves. Who build life-size dolls because they\u2019re lonely. Wait\u2026 I - shit.\n\n***\n\nSamuel has his buddies over and they\u2019re playing some video game, punching virtual women in the face, cackling. I retreat to my room and listen to Brahms. Xe opens xyrs eyes, the pupils roll around in circles, adjusting to the light. Xe lightly curls xyrs fingers around my thumb. Xe is warm. I thought I\u2019d feel some rush of love or recognition, but I feel nothing. Xe looks other. A perfect stranger.\n\n\u2018Hello?\u2019 xe whispers.\n\n\u2018Hey.\u2019 I point at myself. \u2018I am Ez. I made you.\u2019\n\nI point at xem. \u2018You are\u2026  xe.\u2019\n\nI point at me. \u2018I am Ez.\u2019\n\nXe contemplates this for a moment, xyrs breathing quickens, panicked, almost hyperventilating. \u2018I\u2019m not a part of you?\u2019 xe howls. \u2018I\u2019m not a part of you?!\u2019\n\nI clasp my hand over xyrs mouth. \u2018Shh, someone will hear. It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t want to be a part of me, believe me, none of my parts would recommend it,\u2019 I tell xem. \u2018You don\u2019t have to be a part of anyone. You can be whole in yourself.\u2019\n\nXe quiets down, I remove my hand from xyrs mouth and xe says: \u2018So\u2026 what now?\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve been asking myself that for years.\u2019\n\nThere is a picture of me flying a kite and xe is fascinated by it. Xe asks me if we can go do it and I say I\u2019ll think about it. Xe asks me what was outside of this room, and I tell xem the house. Xe asks me what\u2019s outside of the house, and I tell xem a road, a city, a country, a planet. How many people are on the planet? xe asks. Seven billion. How many planets? Eight. What\u2019s outside of that? A star system. How many of those? A hundred billion. Suddenly, xe does not feel like flying a kite any more.\n\n***\n\nFelix, our cat, comes into my room today \u2013 it\u2019s the happiest I\u2019ve ever seen xem. He just about pushes the door open and strides in, paw after paw. Xe leaps up. Felix mews. Xe looks at me. Looks back at Felix.\n\n\u2018Mew?\u2019 xe mews. Felix hops onto the bed, then moseys over to xem, trepidatiously veering for a sniff. Xe freezes.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s okay,\u2019 I say, \u2018You can touch him. He likes to be stroked.\u2019\n\nXe slowly hovers xyrs hand over the creature, lowers it down as if xe were a crane, then runs it along the thick black fur. Xe smiles. Xe strokes Felix gently and Felix gives out a slight purr. Xe presses him to xyrs chest in an embrace.\n\n\u2018What is he?\u2019 xe asks, inspecting him.\n\n\u2018A cat.\u2019\n\n\u2018He\u2019s weird\u2019 xe says. \u2018I like it.\u2019\n\n***\n\nMaybe xe isn\u2019t ready for the supermarket. But it\u2019s too late now. We\u2019re here.\n\n\u2018What am I supposed to be doing exactly?\u2019 xe asks.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re going to go talk to that girl,\u2019 I tell xem, trying to point without anyone but xem seeing. There she is, behind the till, smiling at a customer. Am I being romantic or a stalker? I wonder. It\u2019s such a thin line (although that line can be extended to up to almost a kilometer, with the right restraining order).\n\n\u2018What do I say?\u2019 xe asks me as I try, unsuccessfully, to hide behind a trolley.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know, spread the Christmas cheer. Make her smile. Tell her she\u2019s beautiful. Anything. Just, be honest.\u2019\n\nI gently nudge xem into the queue with a packet of wine gums so xe has something to buy. I slink towards the sandwiches but keep an eye from a distance. Xe stands awkwardly, not sure where to put xyrs hands, big puppy eyes. Xe\u2019s never even seen this many people before. The queue moves slowly. This was a bad idea. I think about running away. Xe\u2019s ogling an infant. Xe doesn\u2019t know what it is, I remember xem looking puzzled when xe heard my brother\u2019s footsteps. Xe\u2019ll be okay. The queue is moving. Yes \u2013 no \u2013 yes, xe\u2019s at the front now, xe\u2019s got the right cashier. Xe makes xyrs approach. Sets xyrs basket down. Twiddles xyrs thumbs. Says something, outstretches a hand but retracts it, nervous. She giggles. I did that for her. It\u2019s going to be okay. Wait, xe hangs xyrs head down, clutches xyrs mouth, squats, spews liters of blood onto the floor, retches, gags.\n\nIt could, admittedly, have been more romantic.\n\nI don\u2019t understand. I accounted for every detail. Xe waddles speedily back to me. Xe can tell I look angry so xe offers me a wine gum. I decline.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry, Ez\u2019 xe says, clearly disappointed in xemself. \u2018There was always going to be blood. You must have known that.\u2019\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t want to believe it.\u2019\n\nI take my head out of my hands and gesture xem through the automatic doors and into the road. \u2018Let\u2019s go home,\u2019 I say. And we do. But xe looks a state. I begin to feel bad. Xyrs eyes are bloodshot, red bar pupil, and xyrs nails are peeling off. I know how devastating a simple \u2018Hi, how are you?\u2019 conversation can be. At least for me, anyway. But xe\u2019s supposed to be better than me.\n\n***\n\nXe\u2019s learning more about the world - which, a lot of people would agree - is never a good idea. I certainly shouldn\u2019t have let xem google. I\u2019m tired of the internet. It\u2019s nice to have the sum of all human knowledge at your fingertips, but not as nice as another person\u2019s fingertips. Plus xe is full of questions now. The granny porn was difficult to explain. As was the holocaust. But xe can\u2019t stop absorbing. Every day I come home from school to find xe\u2019s learnt a little more. Before long xe\u2019ll overtake me. It\u2019s remarkable how much you can learn without school to getting in the way. It doesn\u2019t seem to be helping xem become a better person though, in fact I\u2019d say the more informed xyrs worldview becomes, the less xe wants to be here at all. I\u2019m actually a little worried.\n\n\u2018We need to do it again.\u2019 I tell xem, and by \u2018it\u2019, I mean \u2018bother the pretty checkout girl.\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to... I don\u2019t want to do anything. I ruin everything I touch...\u2019 xe sobs. \u2018Let\u2019s stay here, please. I can\u2019t fail at anything here. I\u2019m sorry. I know I\u2019m being negative. I just can\u2019t leave the house. It\u2019s ridiculous, I know. I need to get a hold of myself\u2026 What\u2019s wrong with me? \u2026 Why did you make me like this?\u2019 Then, with a shriek: \u2018Why did you make me like this?!\u2019\n\nXe is in the fetal position, rocking back and forth, shuddering out of control. I\u2019ve never seen xem like this before. It makes me sad, but it makes me angry too. I consider the option of throwing Felix at xem, but it seems too much. I pick him up and lightly plop him onto the bed. Xe turns his head for a moment, looks at Felix and tries to smile, managing it faintly. Xe strokes him.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t deserve to live.\u2019 xe says, pulling the covers over xyrs head, trying to keep the sick away. \u2018Anyone else could live my life better than me. No one loves me.\u2019\n\n\u2018You have food, clean water, shelter. That should be enough. Some people don\u2019t even have that.\u2019 I don\u2019t know why I said that. I hate it when people say that to me. But I couldn\u2019t say I loved xem. I didn\u2019t love xem. Xe was not how I planned.\n\n\u2018I know, which makes me even worse. I'm ungrateful, I\u2019m going to die, alone, and there\u2019s no God,\u2019 xe muttered. I knew xe\u2019d find out eventually, I just didn\u2019t think it would be so soon. Where was xe getting xyrs information from, youre-going-to-die-alone-and-there-isnt-a-god.com?\n\n\u2018I want you to die,\u2019 I blurt, \u2018I mean, no\u2026 I mean, you should want it too. You don\u2019t want to be here forever. And you don\u2019t need a God either. Someone breathing down the back of your brain, begging to be worshipped, threatening you with fire, ignoring your prayers\u2026\u2019\n\n'How long did you give me?\u2019 xe asks.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know\u2026 The average lifespan.\u2019\n\n\u2018The average lifespan? What? Eighty years? That\u2019s shit. Everyone knows that\u2019s shit. That\u2019s not enough time to do anything. Come on, are you serious? You know what, fuck you. I\u2019ll be glad to go. I don\u2019t want to be around you people. I\u2019ve read up on you. You\u2019re fucked.\u2019\n\n\u2018You should have faith in people.\u2019 I tell xem. \u2018We\u2019re not always bad, everyone tries. Really, they try\u2026 they try so hard.\u2019\n\n\u2018No. They scrape by on the bare minimum. We\u2019ve barely developed since the Ancient Greeks. In a lot of ways they were more advanced than us.\u2019\n\nI worry xe\u2019s right. I don\u2019t usually think of other people as being lazy, mainly only myself. I need to stop being lazy. I need to act. None of us has much time.\n\n***\n\n\"Look at these models taking selfies in front of the Eiffel Tower, how rich and skinny they are. You could be just like them. It\u2019s the next big thing. It\u2019s a revolution. Trust us. This perfume will make you feel powerful, and people always want to fuck power. This comedian will make you forget your impermanence. This butter will make you feel like a child again. Don\u2019t look around. You\u2019re hungry, right? Eat. Drink. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, or the curtain\u2019s glory hole. Everything will be okay; it\u2019s just going to cost you.\"\n\nXe has become more or less catatonic. Xe won\u2019t speak to me, xyrs world ends at the edge of xyrs bed. Xe doesn\u2019t do what xe\u2019s designed to do. Xe was supposed to help people, make them feel less alone. But xe\u2019s a freak. Xe can\u2019t help anyone, and one day xe\u2019ll be completely forgotten. Can\u2019t even get out of bed. How pathetic. I poke xem in the neck.\n\n\u2018Ow!\u2019 xe squeals, \u2018why did you do that?!\u2019\n\nI grab xyrs hair and smash xyrs head into the desk. And I do it again. And I do it again. And I do it again. And I throw xem to the carpet, I kick, I stomp the tread of my boot harder and harder into xyrs face, xe grabs at my legs, and the teeth that I worked so hard on are trudged out of xyrs gums, down xyrs throat, and I keep my eyes open because xe\u2019s squirming, and the boot can\u2019t miss, the blood makes it slippery, the blood that\u2019s everywhere, and xe\u2019s still breathing, xe\u2019s still breathing, then the next stomp gets the skull \u2013 crunch, crunch, crunch, and xe stops squirming, just twitches until xe stops twitching.\n\nThis was not the way; this was not the way to kill. It was better to kill in uniform. Your conscience will allow you a lot if you\u2019re wearing the same coloured hats as everyone else. I needed an everyone else, an anyone else. I needed a coloured hat. I should have put a bag over xyrs head. That\u2019s how the military does it. It wasn\u2019t planned. I try to shake the brain off my shoe. No, not a brain. A central processing unit. No difference. Just DNA. Just source code. It wasn\u2019t planned. Still, it had to be done. William James wrote that \u2018whenever two men meet there are really six people present. There is each as he sees himself, each as the other person sees him, and each man as he really is.\u2019 So there were three of me and three of xem. If I could I would have clobbered at least five of them to death. My knuckles are torn. I have a shower and then go online. As it turns out it\u2019s not unusual for people to lash out at their computers the way I did with xem. In fact as many as 4% of people feel personally victimized when their computer fails.\n\n***\n\nThe supermarket is still hot, still clotted. I\u2019ve still forgotten to put on deodorant. I\u2019m still tired of waiting in line, and the Christmas songs, and the adverts. I still fantasise about the woodchipper. My scalp is still itchy. I\u2019m still ugly. The same girl is still behind the till, with the same eyes, hair, glow. I sit my basket down. Her nametag says Keisha, which I\u2019ve never noticed before, either on account of the spying from a distance, or the copious amounts of vomiting.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know who it was you came in with yesterday,\u2019 she says, scanning the steak. Fuck. This is it. I\u2019m fucked. 'But they were so sweet. I was having the worst day and it really cheered me up, actually helped me keep going, so, um\u2026 Thank them for me?\u2019\n\nI nod, and smile, and for once I do not feel worthless. I wonder what xe said. I don\u2019t speak. I don\u2019t bleed. I just pay, take my change, take my bags, and go home. I even go through the park, and think about the glass delusion. Maybe I\u2019m not just made of glass, or if I am, maybe it\u2019s stained glass.\n\nI\u2019ll make another xe. I\u2019ll make a million of them until I have a voice. Because I can do better. I will do better. I\u2019ll start again. And again. And again. Until I get it right. Until it kills me. Amor fati. I\u2019ll fight \u2013 blood, sweat and tears. Sisyphean. And it\u2019ll take a while, but the pain will give roots. There\u2019ll be heartaches and cranial zings. That\u2019s expected. That\u2019s normal. But it\u2019ll be worth it. So worth it. I'll create. I'll create to feel connected. I am connected. I don\u2019t even exist. I\u2019m not a person. I am a clumping together of cells. I am everything I\u2019ve learnt from my parents, teachers, friends, television \u2013 none of it comes from me. I am nothing, nothing but the universe. I\u2019ll switch on. Wake up. Reach out. I\u2019ll write myself into existence. Holy fuck, it\u2019ll be beautiful.8Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/7627331", "artist_names": "Lee Ritenour", "full_title": "Cross My Heart

under\n\n[Verse 1: Melle Mel]\nBroken glass everywhere\nPeople pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care\nI can't take the smell, can't take the noise\nGot no money to move out, I guess I got no choice\nRats in the front room, roaches in the back\nJunkies in the alley with a baseball bat\nI tried to get away, but I couldn't get far\n'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car\n[Chorus: Melle Mel]\nDon't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge\nI'm trying not to lose my head\nAh-huh-huh-huh-huh\nIt's like a jungle sometimes\nIt makes me wonder how I keep from going under\n\n[Verse 2: Melle Mel]\nStanding on the front stoop, hanging out the window\nWatching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow\nA crazy lady livin' in a bag\nEating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag hag\nSaid she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango\nA zircon princess, seemed to lost her senses\nDown at the peep show watching all the creeps\nSo she can tell her stories to the girls back home\nShe went to the city and got so, so saditty\nShe had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own\n[Chorus: Melle Mel]\nDon't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge\nI'm trying not to lose my head\nAh-huh-huh-huh-huh\nIt's like a jungle sometimes\nIt makes me wonder how I keep from going under\nIt's like a jungle sometimes\nIt makes me wonder how I keep from going under\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Duke Bootee]\nMy brother's doing bad, stole my mother's TV\nSays she watches too much, it's just not healthy\nAll My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night\nCan't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight\nThe bill collectors, they ring my phone\nAnd scare my wife when I'm not home\nGot a bum education, double-digit inflation\nCan't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station\nNeon King Kong standing on my back\nCan't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac\nA mid-range migraine, cancered membrane\nSometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane\n\n[Chorus: Duke Bootee]\nDon't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge\nI'm trying not to lose my head\nIt's like a jungle sometimes\nIt makes me wonder how I keep from going under\nIt's like a jungle sometimes\nIt makes me wonder how I keep from going under\n[Verse 4: Duke Bootee]\nMy son said, \"Daddy, I don't wanna go to school\n'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool\nAnd all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper\nIf I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper\nOr dance to the beat, shuffle my feet\nWear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps\n'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny\nYou got to have a con in this land of milk and honey\nThey pushed that girl in front of the train\nTook her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again\nStabbed that man right in his heart\nGave him a transplant for a brand new start\nI can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark\nKeep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run\nI feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw\nHear them say, 'You want some more?' Livin' on a see-saw\"\n[Chorus: Duke Bootee]\nDon't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge\nI'm trying not to lose my head (Say what?)\nIt's like a jungle sometimes\nIt makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under\nIt's like a jungle sometimes\nIt makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under\nIt's like a jungle sometimes\nIt makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under\nIt's like a jungle sometimes\nIt makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under\n[Verse 5: Melle Mel]\nA child is born with no state of mind\nBlind to the ways of mankind\nGod is smiling on you, but he's frowning too\nBecause only God knows what you'll go through\nYou'll grow in the ghetto living second-rate\nAnd your eyes will sing a song of deep hate\nThe places you play and where you stay\nLooks like one great big alleyway\nYou'll admire all the number-book takers\nThugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers\nDriving big cars, spending twenties and tens\nAnd you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh\nSmugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers\nPickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers\nYou say, \"I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool\"\nBut then you wind up droppin' out of high school\nNow you're unemployed, all null and void\nWalking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd\nTurned stick-up kid, but look what you done did\nGot sent up for a eight-year bid\nNow your manhood is took and you're a maytag\nSpend the next two years as a undercover fag\nBeing used and abused to serve like hell\n'Til one day you was found hung dead in the cell\nIt was plain to see that your life was lost\nYou was cold and your body swung back and forth\nBut now your eyes sing the sad, sad song\nOf how you lived so fast and died so young, so\n[Chorus: Melle Mel]\nDon't push me cause I'm close to the edge\nI'm trying not to lose my head\nAh-huh-huh-huh-huh\nIt's like a jungle sometimes\nIt makes me wonder how I keep from going under\nHuh, ah-huh-huh-huh-huh\nIt's like a jungle sometimes\nIt makes me wonder how I keep from going under\nHuh, ah-huh-huh-huh-huh\n\n[Outro Skit]\nYo, Mel, you see that girl there?\nYeah, man (Ooh-ooh)\nYo, that sound like Cowboy, man\nCool\nYo, what's up, Money?\nYo\nHey, where's Creole and Rahiem at, man?\nI think they upstairs cooling out\nSo what's up for tonight, y'all?\nYo, we could go down to Fever, man\nLet's go check out Junebug, man\nAyo, you know that girl Betty?\nYeah, man\nHer moms got robbed, man\nNot again, man (What?)\nShe got hurt bad\nWhen did this happen?

Trick", "lyrics": "She\u2019s Tight LyricsWhen I'm down I make a call\nGot the number written on the wall\nFirst it's busy then I try again\nOh, who's she talking to, could it be him?\n\nI got the number and it starts to ring\nI get excited and I start to dream\nI start to fantasize of memory lane\nThen she answers and she says right way\nShe says I'm home on my own, home all alone\nSo I got off the phone\n(She's tight.) She's ahead of her time\n(She's tight.) She's one of a kind\n(She's tight.) She's a talented girl\n(She's tight.) She's got her head down tight\n\nI have something got to say to you\nAmnesia and my train of thought\nOn the tip, tip of my tongue\nI had a vision when I was young\n\nYou floated in, we floated up\nThrough the window and down the hall\nI had a smoke and went upstairs\nTurned the door and opened the key. She spoke...\nI'm on my own, home all alone\nSo I got off the phone\n\n(She's tight.) She's ahead of her time\n(She's tight.) She's one of a kind\n(She's tight.) She's a talented girl\n(She's tight.) She's got her head down tight\n\n(She's tight.) She's giving me the go\n(She's tight.) She's giving me the high sign\n(She's tight.) We'll turn off the lights\n(She's tight.) Pull down the shades\n(She's nice, she's tight.) Turn on the cam'ra\n(She's nice, she's tight.)

share with me this special day\nWhere a ribbon's in the sky for our love\nIf allowed may I touch your hand\nAnd if pleased may I once again\nSo that you too will understand\nThere's a ribbon in the sky for our love\n\n[Chorus]\nDo...Do\nDo Do Do Do Do\nHMM HMM\n[Verse 2]\nThis is not a coincidence\nAnd far more than a lucky chance\nBut what is that was always meant\nIs our ribbon in the sky for our love, love\nWe can't lose with God on our side\nWe'll find strength in each tear we cry\nFrom now on it will be you and I\nAnd our ribbon in the sky\nRibbon in the sky\nA ribbon in the sky for our

be the one\nPlease be the one\nPlease be the one\n\nWell, if your worlds a lonely place\nIt's something you never show\nAnd love could stare you in the face\nAnd baby, you'd never know\nI said, please be the one\nPlease be the one\nPlease be the one\nAll the years, they took their toll on you\nYour innocence has all disappeared\nTell me why you had to learn your love was\nSomething to fear\n\nWell, someday the tables here will turn\nAnd I won't want to play\nAnd for my sweet kiss you will yearn\nWhen it's too late to say\nPlease be the one\nPlease be the one\n\nREPEAT CHORUSYou might also
