protect\nDon't take it for granted, I know\nThat if you want to stay close\nWe've got to show some respect\n[Verse 2]\nBut I believe in working, then I believe in a little help\nCause I'm not a light unto myself\nWithout a thing of value, why settle for second best\nWe don't know what's up ahead\nAnd we can't let ourselves forget\n\n[Chorus]\nWe've got to show some respect\nWe've got to learn to protect\nDon't take it for granted, I know\nThat if you want to stay close\nWe've got to show some respect\n\n[Verse 3]\nFor the things that I love about you\nFrom the woman that you see inside\nDon't let it walk out the door\nLove follows every time\n\n[Chorus]\nWe've got to show some respect\nWe've got to learn to protect\nDon't take it for granted, I know\nThat if you want to stay close\nWe've

Crawford)\n\nI think that it's time daring we had a talk\nI think that we're making a big mistake\nI've been feeling lately the magic is gone\nAre we just together for convenience sake, baby\n\nI don't believe it (feeling), I don't think that's true (tied down)\nIt'll just pass (need to) if we allow it to (break free)\nIt's just a stage (they say) we're going through (clean cuts)\nI think you're just restless (heal much) for something new (faster)\nBaby, feeling like we pay our dime\nAnd all we get in return is a peace of each other's time\n\nAre we just taxi dancing, lost somewhere in a slow dance for two\nAnd the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song\n\nAre we just taxi dancing, you're playing for me and I'm paying for you\nAnd are we holding on to a feeling with desperation\n\nDon't know if you're right, don't know if you're wrong\nSeems to me we haven't danced for long\n\nDon't make it hard (I won't), don't make it easy (hold you)\nI'll just walk away (if you) at the end of the song (must go)\n\nBaby, put one last nickel in the juke box\nGive that (?) we once felt just one final spin around\n\n'Cause we're just taxi dancing, lost somewhere in a slow dance for two\nAnd the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song\nAnd we're just dancing\n\n(Solo)\n\nAnd the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song\nAre we just taxi dancing, you're paying for me and I'm paying for you\nAnd are we holding on to a feeling in desperation\nSee Rick Springfield LiveGet tickets as low as

I wonder if I have enough\nTo keep from breaking down\nNo mercy in this town\n\nEvery day is just another test\nSeems I'm always second best\nBut you learn along the way\nThat's the price you have to pay\n\nI try to stay defiant, be tough and self-reliant\nThough I get tired to the bone\nLove is just a wish I keep inside\nHow's it gonna help me to survive?\nLooks like I'm in this fight alone\nAnd I'm livin' in desperate times\nBeing alive's my only crime\nDon't care what I have to do\nI'll find some way to make it through\nOh, and I'm livin' in desperate times\nAnd it's too late to change my mind\nTill these desperate times are done, gonna run\nWatch me run\n\nInnocents get taken in\nBy the promise of an easy win\nThey start off so naive\nSo eager to believe\nBut the glitter of the city lights\nOnly covers up a lonely night\nOf strangers slamming doors\nYou're hungry and ignored\n\nI've faced the competition\nI've made the hard decisions\nWill it be worth it in the end?\nTaking any chance that comes along\nGetting hard to tell what's right or wrong\nI only wish I had a friend\n\nAnd I'm livin' in desperate times\nBeing alive's my only crime\nDon't care what I have to do\nI'll find some way to make it through\nOh, and I'm livin' in desperate times\nAnd it's too late to change my mind\nTill these desperate times are done, gonna run\nWatch me runYou might also likeEmbed"},

first off, we're supposed to be pushing card stock this week.\nSo, let's push card stock this week.\nAlso What is this? Tape recorder.\nFor what? For recording.\nMichael is on vacation and he has asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.\nOkay.\nKaren, any news from that law firm? Yeah, the deal closed yesterday.\nIt's a six-month commitment.\nOh, my God! Dwight, what are you doing? What? You're not allowed to take off your pants in the middle of the office.\nI'm not.\nDwight, you know what, just back off, okay? That's making me uncomfortable.\nThis is sexual harassment, by the way.\nOh, my God, he's got a knife! I do not have a knife.\nNo.\nLet the record show that Dwight K.\nSchrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck? Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar! Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.\nI am not.\nOh, Jim Carrey just walked in.\nDwight, get his autograph for Michael Jim Carrey did not just walk in, okay? Yes, he Dwight, what is that on your stomach? Is that a Muppet Babies tattoo? Oh, my God, Karen, you're right.\nThat is Animal from the Muppet Babies.\nYou can't see my stomach I am now chopping off Phyllis' head with a chain saw! Hey, mon! Hey.\nYou have a bunch of messages and That's nice.\nHannah quit while you were gone.\nI guess she memoed to file some complaints she had about being a working mother, and so you might also have to be deposed.\nRelax.\nJust relax, okay? Okay.\nI'll get to all of it later.\nIt's kind of serious.\nAren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it.\nAsk me.\nHow was Jamaica? It was so good! Hey, mon! At Sandals, Jamaica, when somebody says, \"Hey, mon,\" everybody says, \"Hey, mon,\" back.\nOh, Michael, I'm glad you're here.\nStanley.\nYou know what? It is really good to see you, too.\nMy bonus check was $100 less than you promised.\nOkay, well, payroll is in charge of all of that They said I should talk to you.\nWell, I am just getting settled in.\nSo I'm gonna I am not doing a lick more work until I get my full bonus check.\nYou are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers, mon.\nYou wanna talk about it? Nope.\nI still haven't found an apartment yet.\nI'm living in a hotel.\nYesterday, I saw a for-rent sign down the street from Jim, and he said he didn't think it'd be such a good idea.\nHe said it would be like we were living together in different houses, two blocks away.\nFeelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! Feelin' hot, hot, hot! That's all I know so far, but I'm gonna keep practicing.\nIt's good.\nYou know, I had never been out of the country before now.\nI got to see how Jamaicans live.\nIt is great.\nYou know, they just relax, they party all the time.\nIt's kind of an impoverished country.\nYeah.\nGosh.\nGreat.\nYou know what, Pam? Make a note.\nI want us all to start having pi\u00f1a coladas every day at 3:00.\nWell, you can't today.\nWe're doing inventory.\nInventory's at the end of December.\nWe couldn't do it without you, so we postponed.\nI specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.\nInventory is boring.\nIn the islands, they don't make you do stuff like take inventory.\nWhy do you think so many businesses move to the Caymans? Tonight, we are going to have an inventory luau.\nI want to bring back a little slice of paradise to the Dunder Mifflin Warehouse Inventory.\nSo, Party Planning Committee, get on it.\nBy the end of the day? That's impossible.\nThe Jamaicans don't have a word for \"impossible\".\nYep, it's English.\nIt's \"impossible\".\nMichael, there's no way we can do it in time.\nHow hard is a luau? All you need are some grass skirts, pineapple, poi, tiki torches, suckling pig, some fire dancers.\nThat's all you need.\nCome on in! Settle in.\nSettling Settling And settled.\nGood.\nThere is something I would like to show everybody.\nSee this sign? \"No shirt.\nNo shoes.\nNo problem.\n\" This is an attitude I would like all of you to have right here.\nSo what if we have to stay late and do inventory? No problem.\nOh, my God.\nIs that Jan? What? Where? What? On the left.\nNo, no, no.\nThat's Oh, my God No, that's a German woman named Urgle Grue.\nJan told me to play it cool and not tell anybody because it could get us both in trouble.\nSo, officially, I did not see her.\nBut I did see Jan there in our room at night and in the morning.\nAnd that's all I'm gonna say.\nSex.\nSex.\nWe had sex.\nI had sex with her.\nI had sex with Jan.\nHey, dude.\nI just got back from Jamaica.\nBig whoop.\nI was in Hotlanta.\nThat whole town is waxed.\nYeah, that sounds amazing, but you know what? The lady, Jan Levinson, wanted to go to Montego Bay.\nYou took The Ice Queen? I don't buy it.\nWell, I'm looking at a photo, right now, and, I'm telling you, it could be in Maxim.\nThey wouldn't give you a subscription to Maxim.\nOh, no? No.\nOkay.\nWell, check this out.\nI'm sending you some e-mail.\nYou got it? What? No, I got nothing.\nCheck it again.\nHit refresh.\nYeah, Mike, still nothing.\nOkay, wait a second.\nI sent it to you at packer@dundermifflin.\ncom Packaging@dundermifflin.\ncom Uh-oh.\nWait.\nI just got it from somebody else.\nWow! This is hot.\nDamn! How do I get you out of this picture? Darryl? Hey.\nHi, where's Darryl? He's in the office.\nOkay.\nHi.\nHey, man, how's it going? All right.\nWhat's up, Mike? That's great.\nOkay.\nSo did you get an e-mail from me? Yeah.\nOkay.\nWell, that was supposed to go to Packer, not Packaging.\nDid you already forward it to a whole bunch of people? Uh-uh.\nOkay.\nWell, did you get the second e-mail that I sent explaining that the first e-mail was a mistake and that you should delete it? Yep.\nHave you sent that out to everyone? Mike, I'm very busy down here.\nYikes.\nAlready sent it to you, my friend.\nFantastic.\nBoring.\nCall me if she rolls over.\nHey.\nHey.\nYou okay? Yeah.\nYou sure? Yeah.\nYes.\nI'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen.\nOh! You want to talk about it? Really? I have a special assignment for you.\nWho's the target? A sensitive e-mail has been released into the office.\nIt contains a file.\nA picture.\nThe filename is Jamaica Jan Sun Princess.\nWhat's it of? Not important.\nUnless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment.\nOkay, then forget it.\nOkay, I accept it.\nSo, I don't know, I just feel like we've been dating a month, right? Same street, I think that might be a little close.\nA little bit much.\nWhat? How far away does she live now, like, 10 minutes? Yeah, I guess.\nHonestly, I think you should go easy on her.\nNo, I didn't mind helping Jim with his problem.\nThat's what friends do.\nI help Phyllis all the time.\nJust yesterday, I untangled a piece of tape from her hair.\nSo, yeah.\nHey, thanks a lot.\nOh, don't worry about it.\nI mean, it's better than listening to Michael play a conch shell, which is what I was doing.\nOh, also, Michael went to Jamaica with Jan Yeah.\nHow have we not talked about this already? I mean, what happened there? Kidnapping? Hey, I need to talk to you Not now, not ever.\nabout you and Jan.\nNone of your business.\nI wish that were true, but it It It seems from that photo that two of you have entered into an intimate relationship.\nThat photo is my personal property, and if you are telling me that you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.\nMichael, nine different people e - mailed me that photo, including my ex-wife and we don't talk.\nWell, this is probably the icebreaker you need.\nYou know, for your own protection, you should disclose the relationship to HR.\nI bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you, you skeevy little perv? All right.\nIf you're having a relationship with your superior, you must disclose it.\nNo, no.\nNo, I am not dating Jan.\nShe was very clear about that.\nJust two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on Earth.\nGot enough, weirdo? All right, thanks, Michael.\nOkay.\nOkay, we only have three hours, people, to plan a whole luau and you're not helping.\nWhat are the ingredients of poi? I've called every grocery store in Scranton and no one sells whole pigs.\nDid you try the petting zoo? Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.\nJust a second.\nMichael? It's Jan on the phone.\nOh, God! No, no, no.\nHang up.\nHang up.\nTell her I'm not here.\nDon't Don't I've ran out of gas.\nI hit a deer.\nI hit I hit a deer with my car.\nNo.\nI hit a cat.\nTell her I hit a cat.\nHe'll call you back.\nOkay.\nGreat.\nDo you think she bought it? Okay.\nOkay.\nMichael hit a deer? Michael! Michael, there's an emergency in the warehouse.\nAn accident? Is somebody hurt? No, it's It involves the photograph.\nOh, God! No, no, no.\nMike, you're a rock star, man! You are the man! Yeah! Well done! All right.\nOkay.\nHit that corporate booty.\nNice to hit it! Hello! Hi! Attention, everyone.\nApparently, there is an e-mail circulating around that contains a very PG-13 rated picture of me and a woman.\nJan.\nNo, Kevin, a woman.\nMaybe Jan, maybe Urgle Grue.\nMy point is that if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it, sight unseen.\nLet's be professional, all right? Feelin' Feelin' hot, hot, hot Hey! Hey.\nWhat are you doing out here? Island living, you know.\nJan called.\nShe's coming in later to talk to you.\nDid she say what it's about?

as cold as you're feeling inside\n\nAnd all of you friends are either married, vanished\nOr just left alone\nBut that's no reason to just stop living\nThat's no excuse to just give in to a sad and lonely heart\n\nDon't forget to dance, no, no, no\nDon't forget to smile\nDon't forget to dance, no, no, no\nForget it for a while\n'Cause darling, darling\nI bet you danced a good one in your time\nAnd if this were a party\nI'd really make sure the next one would be mine\nYes, you with the broken heart\n\nDon't forget to dance, no, no, no\nDon't forget to smile\nDon't forget to dance, no, no, no\nForget it for a while\n\nDon't forget to dance, no, no, no\nForget it for a while\n\nYou walk down the street\nAnd all the young punks whistle at you\nA nice bit of old\nJust goes to show what you can achieve\nWith the right attitude\nAs you pass them by\nThey whisper their remarks one to another\nAnd you give them the eye\nEven though you know that you could be their mother\nYou do the thing you love the most\nWhat separates you from the rest\nAnd what you love to do the most?\nAnd when they ask me how you danced\nI'll say that you danced real close\nYou might also likeDon't forget to dance, no, no, no\nDon't forget to danceEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1284933", "artist_names": "The Animals", "full_title": "The Night

never there\nWhen you're all alone, you really get to learn\nIf you get back up, they're gonna come around\nAll the sycophants, they love to make romance\nTo the ugly sound of 'em tellin' you\nWhat you wanna hear and you pretend\n'Cause they all agree you're supposed to have a better life\nBut you're feelin' worse\nAnd they build you up 'til you fool yourself\nThat you're something else and it's like a curse\n'Cause you can't live up to what they made of you\nAnd they tell you that you're losin' friends\n[Chorus]\nLosin' friends, losin' friends\nYou got nothin' to lose\nYou don't lose when you lose fake friends\n\n[Bridge]\nHuah!\nWoo, uh\nWoo\nOh, get out!\nWoo, woo hoo\nAlright!\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou go and tell 'em you were king of the hill\nWhen you need a hand - that was yesterday!\nYou see 'em laugh while you're on your knees\nAnd it breaks your heart 'cause you gave so much\nAnd you can't believe that you hit the ground\nAnd you notice you've been losin' friends\n\n[Chorus]\nLosin' friends, losin' friends\nYou got nothin' to lose\nYou don't lose when you lose fake friends\nYou might also like[Outro]\n(Oh, no, woo)\nLosin' friends, losin' friends\nYou

place for tears\nThere's no reason to wonder after all of these years\nSure we had some good times\nAnd so who's to blame\nIt's so hard to tell when you both feel the pain\nAfter the years have come

their aim\nAnd they hope for time on their side\nAnd they keep a ticket to ride\n\nThey keep watching for signs in the land\nThey keep watching for signs in the land\nAnd they stand there watching the sky\nAnd they stand there ready to fly\nHere's to never letting go\nThough sometimes it does get lonely\n\nI still walk out in the morning light\nJust to see what is there\nI hear music in silent nights\nSearching I find a reason to care\nOne heart moving still the same\nStill in the game\n\nHere's to lovers who reach for it all\nNever matching the rise with the fall\nAnd they just can't leave it alone\nAnd they want it all till it's gone\nHere's to players who can't leave their song\nAnd it haunts them\nTheir night is so long\n'Cause there's music there in their mind\nFrom a world they're trying to find\n\nHere's to never letting go\nThough sometimes it does get lonelyYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/930069", "artist_names": "Paul

me\n'Til you came along and you touched me and set me free\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo we slipped away last night eased on down to the Cay\nFlying so high we hitched a ride on a Gulf Stream breeze\nLiving on love and the fruits from tropical trees\nWith a song in our hearts and our eyes on the West Indies\n[Chorus]\nIt's just another day in paradise\nLoving the night away 'til the sunrise\nSeeing that \"I love you\" look in your eyes\nIt's just another day in paradise\n\n[Verse 3]\nA bottle of rum listening to the steel drum band\nLaughing in the moonlight along the beach we ran\nSplashing naked in the sea making love upon the sand\nFalling fast asleep like children hand in hand\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's just another day in paradise\nLoving the night away 'til the sunrise\nSeeing that \"I love you\" look in your eyes\nIt's just another day in paradise\n\n[Verse 4]\nI woke up this morning with the sunlight in my eyes\nGuess it was only a dream I hear the city outside\nBut I look at you sleeping and honey now I realize\nThat anywhere with you is paradise\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's just another day in paradise\nLoving the night away 'til the sunrise\nSeeing that \"I love you\" look in your eyes\nIt's just another day in paradise\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIt's just another day in paradise\nLoving the night away 'til the sunrise\nSeeing that \"I love you\" look in your eyes\nIt's just another day in

aren't nice\nEverybody's talking smack, Running games on this and that\nRacial resentment adds to this contentment\nTalk to any guy he'll tell you taxes are too high\nBooks movies are corrupt, suicide is way up\nKids are a sorry lot, some folks say it's kind of pot\nPhony ego trips, everyone has flipped\nIf it ain't one thing it's another\nIf it ain't one thing it's another\n\nEverybody's shacking up, married folks are packing up\nCountry's going up in smoke, Where is Noah with his boat\nBlacks marching on dc, 400 years still not free\nMartin paid all a man can pay, still he's not a holiday\nFolks messing with my mind, make me Frankenstein\nThis woman by my side, she's Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde\nCan't get my head on right, problems day and night\nTry to calm my nerves I've tried

evening\nA long time ago my old grandmother bless her heart\nUsed to sit me on her knee and pull out her Good Book\nAnd she said my son, my child, don't you ever get to grown, to famous, to rich to forget the man upstairs\nAnd she used to turn to Matthew chapter 24, and there the disciples would talking to the master\nAnd they said Lord tell us what will be the sign of your coming\nAnd the end to all this confusion on Earth\nAnd the Good Lord said, my children watch out that nobody deceive you\nFor the last days, there'll be lots of tribulation, wars, and famines\nAnd earthquakes on different places on the Earth\nAnd there will be no understanding among the people of the Earth\nHe said but as you see these things occurring\nDon't become too discouraged, just lift yours head up high\nBecause your deliverance is getting nearer\nAnd he spoke about the proclamation about coming kingdom or government of god\nThat will eventually take over this Earth and rule over the whole Earth\nAnd turning to Daniel chapter two\nAnd there Daniel describes that this kingdom won't be an earthly kingdom\nBut it will be ruled by God\nNote in the book of Revelations it talks\nAbout how there will be a man who'll be Jesus\nAnd whose faithful 144, 000 who would bring all of mankind back to perfection\nAw, somebody out there knows exactly what I'm talking about\nIsaiah, Isaiah, a long time ago said I see old people growing young again\nI see lame people running and leaping just like a gazelle\nAnd blind people will see again\nAnd we won't have to worry about our children going out to play at night\nThey'll be able to play with a snake, brotherhood\nThere'll be brotherhood and peace and tranquility on the earth\nAw it makes me feel good when I read over in Revelations\nThat it say God would wipe out every tear from my eyes\nYeah that's in Revelations chapter 21\nWhy don't you pick up a Good Book and read all about it for yourselves\nAnd my friends I don't know if I'll ever see you again\nLife is certainly uncertain these days\nI'm sure you'll agree to that\nBut keep dreaming the big dream\nGet down on your knees and ask the big guy in the sky for his spirit to sustain you\nAnd pray for me, I'll be praying for youEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1689054", "artist_names": "Carole King", "full_title": "One to One

Big Benben.\n\nLast rose Castile of summer left bloom I feel so sad alone.\n\nPwee! Little wind piped wee.\n\nTrue men. Lid Ker Cow De and Doll. Ay, ay. Like you men. Will lift your tschink with tschunk.\n\nFff! Oo!\n\nWhere bronze from anear? Where gold from afar? Where hoofs?\n\nRrrpr. Kraa. Kraandl.\n\nThen not till then. My eppripfftaph. Be pfrwritt.\n\nDone.\n\nBegin!\n\nBronze by gold, miss Douce's head by miss Kennedy's head, over the crossblind of the Ormond bar heard the viceregal hoofs go by, ringing steel.\n\n\u2014Is that her? asked miss Kennedy.\n\nMiss Douce said yes, sitting with his ex, pearl grey and eau de Nil.\n\u2014Exquisite contrast, miss Kennedy said.\n\nWhen all agog miss Douce said eagerly:\n\n\u2014Look at the fellow in the tall silk.\n\n\u2014Who? Where? gold asked more eagerly.\n\n\u2014In the second carriage, miss Douce's wet lips said, laughing in the sun.\n\nHe's looking. Mind till I see.\n\nShe darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.\n\nHer wet lips tittered:\n\n\u2014He's killed looking back.\n\nShe laughed:\n\n\u2014O wept! Aren't men frightful idiots?\n\nWith sadness.\n\nMiss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair.\n\nSadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.\n\n\u2014It's them has the fine times, sadly then she said.\n\nA man.\nBloowho went by by Moulang's pipes bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine's antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll's dusky battered plate, for Raoul.\nThe boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And\n\n\u2014There's your teas, he said.\n\nMiss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.\n\n\u2014What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.\n\n\u2014Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.\n\n\u2014Your beau, is it?\n\nA haughty bronze replied:\n\n\u2014I'll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.\n\n\u2014Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as she threatened as he had come.\n\nBloom.\n\nOn her flower frowning miss Douce said:\n\n\u2014Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn't conduct himself I'll wring his ear for him a yard long.\n\nLadylike in exquisite contrast.\n\n\u2014Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.\n\nShe poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.\nYes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.\n\n\u2014Am I awfully sunburnt?\n\nMiss bronze unbloused her neck.\n\n\u2014No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?\n\nMiss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell.\n\n\u2014And leave it to my hands, she said.\n\n\u2014Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.\n\nBidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce\n\n\u2014Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that old fogey in Boyd's for something for my skin.\n\nMiss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:\n\n\u2014O, don't remind me of him for mercy' sake!\n\n\u2014But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.\n\nSweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.\n\n\u2014No, don't, she cried.\n\n\u2014I won't listen, she cried.\n\nBut Bloom?\n\nMiss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey's tone:\n\n\u2014For your what? says he.\n\nMiss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed again:\n\n\u2014Don't let me think of him or I'll expire. The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms.\n\nShe sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.\n\n\u2014Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!\n\nShrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy's throat. Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a snout in quest.\n\n\u2014O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?\n\nMiss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:\n\n\u2014And your other eye!\n\nBloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner's name. Why do I always think Figather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Lore's huguenot name. By Bassi's blessed virgins Bloom's dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white under, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I could not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus' son. He might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of fellows in: her white.\n\nBy went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.\n\nOf sin.\n\nIn a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.\n\nAh, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.\n\nMiss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping, her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:\n\n\u2014O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried. With his bit of beard!\n\nDouce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.\n\n\u2014Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.\n\nShrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I knows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless.\n\nMarried to Bloom, to greaseabloom.\n\n\u2014O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I wished\n\nI hadn't laughed so much. I feel all wet.\n\n\u2014O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!\n\nAnd flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.\n\nBy Cantwell's offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi's virgins, bright of their oils. Nannetti's father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I want. Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On. Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets of sin.\n\nFlushed less, still less, goldenly paled.\n\nInto their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.\n\n\u2014O, welcome back, miss Douce.\n\nHe held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?\n\n\u2014Tiptop.\n\nHe hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.\n\n\u2014Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand all day.\n\nBronze whiteness.\n\n\u2014That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.\n\nMiss Douce of satin douced her arm away.\n\n\u2014O go away! she said. You're very simple, I don't think.\n\nHe was.\n\n\u2014Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.\n\n\u2014You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did the doctor order today?\n\n\u2014Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I'll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.\n\nJingle.\n\n\u2014With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.\n\nWith grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane's she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes.\n\n\u2014By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must be a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at last, they say. Yes. Yes.\n\nYes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid's, into the bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.\n\nNone nought said nothing. Yes.\n\nGaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:\n\n\u2014O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!\n\n\u2014Was Mr Lidwell in today?\n\nIn came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write. Buy paper. Daly's. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on the rye.\n\n\u2014He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.\n\nLenehan came forward.\n\n\u2014Was Mr Boylan looking for me?\n\nHe asked. She answered:\n\n\u2014Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?\n\nShe asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page:\n\n\u2014No. He was not.\n\nMiss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.\n\n\u2014Peep! Who's in the corner?\n\nNo glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her stops. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.\n\nJingle jaunty jingle.\n\nGirlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:\n\n\u2014Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?\n\nHe droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.\n\nHe sighed aside:\n\n\u2014Ah me! O my!\n\nHe greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.\n\n\u2014Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.\n\n\u2014Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.\n\nLenehan opened most genial arms. Who?\n\n\u2014Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.\n\nDry.\n\nMr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.\n\n\u2014I see, he said. I didn't recognise him for the moment. I hear he is keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?\n\nHe had.\n\n\u2014I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In Mooney's en ville and in Mooney's sur mer. He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.\n\nHe smiled at bronze's teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:\n\n\u2014The \u00e9lite of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, Hugh\n\nMacHugh, Dublin's most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O'Madden Burke.\n\nAfter an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and\n\n\u2014That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.\n\nHe see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his glass.\n\nHe looked towards the saloon door.\n\n\u2014I see you have moved the piano.\n\n\u2014The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.\n\n\u2014Is that a fact?\n\n\u2014Didn't he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too, poor fellow. Not twenty I'm sure he was.\n\n\u2014Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.\n\nHe drank and strayed away.\n\n\u2014So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.\n\nGod's curse on bitch's bastard.\n\nTink to her pity cried a diner's bell. To the door of the bar and diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.\n\nWith patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jinglejaunty blazes boy.\n\nUpholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.\n\nTwo sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely's wise Bloom in Daly's Henry Flower bought. Are you not happy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means something, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is. Respectable girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For some man. For Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.\n\nJingling on supple rubbers it jaunted from the bridge to Ormond quay. Follow. Risk it. Go quick. At four. Near now. Out.\n\n\u2014Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.\n\n\u2014Aha... I was forgetting... Excuse...\n\n\u2014And four.\n\nAt four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go. Ternoon. Think you're the only pebble on the beach? Does that to all.\n\nFor men.\n\nIn drowsy silence gold bent on her page.\n\nFrom the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the tuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now poised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly and softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.\n\nPat paid for diner's popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with miss\n\nDouce.\n\n\u2014The bright stars fade...\n\nA voiceless song sang from within, singing:\n\n\u2014... the morn is breaking.\n\nA duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love's leavetaking, life's, love's morn.\n\n\u2014The dewdrops pearl...\n\nLenehan's lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.\n\n\u2014But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.\n\nJingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.\n\nShe rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.\n\n\u2014Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.\n\nShe answered, slighting:\n\n\u2014Ask no questions and you'll hear no lies.\n\nLike lady, ladylike.\n\nBlazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode. Yes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and knew and hailed him:\n\n\u2014See the conquering hero comes.\n\nBetween the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered hero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding's legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.\n\n\u2014And I from thee...\n\n\u2014I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.\n\nHe touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled on him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.\n\nSmart Boylan bespoke potions.\n\n\u2014What's your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me. Wire in yet?\n\nNot yet. At four she. Who said four?\n\nCowley's red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff's office.\n\nAvoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting.\n\nWait.\n\nHello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What, Ormond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there. See, not be seen. I think I'll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom followed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.\n\nMiss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.\n\n\u2014O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!\nBut easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.\n\n\u2014Why don't you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.\n\nShebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his lips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and syrupped with her voice:\n\n\u2014Fine goods in small parcels.\n\nThat is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.\n\n\u2014Here's fortune, Blazes said.\n\nHe pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.\n\n\u2014Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...\n\n\u2014Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.\n\n\u2014Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.\n\n\u2014I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own, you know. Fancy of a friend of mine.\n\nLenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce's lips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.\n\nIdolores. The eastern seas.\n\nClock whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave), bearing away teatray. Clock clacked.\n\nMiss Douce took Boylan's coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It clanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For me.\n\n\u2014What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?\n\nO'clock.\n\nLenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes Boylan's elbowsleeve.\n\n\u2014Let's hear the time, he said.\n\nThe bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables. Aimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near the door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come: whet appetite. I couldn't do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.\n\nSparkling bronze azure eyed Blazure's skyblue bow and eyes.\n\n\u2014Go on, pressed Lenehan. There's no-one. He never heard.\n\n\u2014... to Flora's lips did hie.\n\nHigh, a high note pealed in the treble clear.\n\nBronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought\n\nBlazes Boylan's flower and eyes.\n\n\u2014Please, please.\n\nHe pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.\n\n\u2014I could not leave thee...\n\n\u2014Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.\n\n\u2014No, now, urged Lenehan. Sonnezlacloche! O do! There's no-one.\n\nShe looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling faces watched her bend.\n\nQuavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord, and lost and found it, faltering.\n\n\u2014Go on! Do! Sonnez!\n\nBending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted them still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.\n\n\u2014Sonnez!\n\nSmack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter smackwarm against her smackable a woman's warmhosed thigh.\n\n\u2014La Cloche! cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust there.\n\nShe smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren't men?), but, lightward gliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.\n\n\u2014You're the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.\n\nBoylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his chalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound eyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by mirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering, a spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.\n\nYes, bronze from anearby.\n\n\u2014... Sweetheart, goodbye!\n\n\u2014I'm off, said Boylan with impatience.\n\nHe slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.\n\n\u2014Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.\n\nTom Rochford...\n\n\u2014Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.\n\nLenehan gulped to go.\n\n\u2014Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I'm coming.\n\nHe followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the threshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.\n\n\u2014How do you do, Mr Dollard?\n\n\u2014Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard's vague bass answered, turning an instant from Father Cowley's woe. He won't give you any trouble, Bob. Alf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We'll put a barleystraw in that Judas Iscariot's ear this time.\n\nSighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.\n\n\u2014Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a ditty. We heard the piano.\n\nBald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie. And Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How warm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me see. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.\n\n\u2014What's that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.\n\n\u2014Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.\n\nHe ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the: hold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His gouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.\n\nBald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted Power and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.\n\nJingle a tinkle jaunted.\n\nBloom heard a jing, a little sound. He's off. Light sob of breath Bloom sighed on the silent bluehued flowers. Jingling. He's gone. Jingle. Hear.\n\n\u2014Love and War, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. God be with old times.\n\nMiss Douce's brave eyes, unregarded, turned from the crossblind, smitten by sunlight. Gone. Pensive (who knows?), smitten (the smiting light), she lowered the dropblind with a sliding cord. She drew down pensive (why did he go so quick when I?) about her bronze, over the bar where bald stood by sister gold, inexquisite contrast, contrast inexquisite nonexquisite, slow cool dim seagreen sliding depth of shadow, eau de Nil.\n\n\u2014Poor old Goodwin was the pianist that night, Father Cowley reminded them. There was a slight difference of opinion between himself and the Collard grand.\n\nThere was.\n\n\u2014A symposium all his own, Mr Dedalus said. The devil wouldn't stop him. He was a crotchety old fellow in the primary stage of drink.\n\n\u2014God, do you remember? Ben bulky Dollard said, turning from the punished keyboard. And by Japers I had no wedding garment.\n\nThey laughed all three. He had no wed. All trio laughed. No wedding garment.\n\n\u2014Our friend Bloom turned in handy that night, Mr Dedalus said. Where's my pipe, by the way?\n\nHe wandered back to the bar to the lost chord pipe. Bald Pat carried two diners' drinks, Richie and Poldy. And Father Cowley laughed again.\n\n\u2014I saved the situation, Ben, I think.\n\n\u2014You did, averred Ben Dollard. I remember those tight trousers too. That was a brilliant idea, Bob.\n\nFather Cowley blushed to his brilliant purply lobes. He saved the situa. Tight trou. Brilliant ide.\n\n\u2014I knew he was on the rocks, he said. The wife was playing the piano in the coffee palace on Saturdays for a very trifling consideration and who was it gave me the wheeze she was doing the other business? Do you remember? We had to search all Holles street to find them till the chap in Keogh's gave us the number. Remember? Ben remembered, his broad visage wondering.\n\n\u2014By God, she had some luxurious operacloaks and things there.\n\nMr Dedalus wandered back, pipe in hand.\n\n\u2014Merrion square style. Balldresses, by God, and court dresses. He wouldn't take any money either. What? Any God's quantity of cocked hats and boleros and trunkhose. What?\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, Mr Dedalus nodded. Mrs Marion Bloom has left off clothes of all descriptions.\n\nJingle jaunted down the quays. Blazes sprawled on bounding tyres.\n\nLiver and bacon. Steak and kidney pie. Right, sir. Right, Pat.\n\nMrs Marion. Met him pike hoses. Smell of burn. Of Paul de Kock. Nice name he.\n\n\u2014What's this her name was? A buxom lassy. Marion...\n\n\u2014Tweedy.\n\n\u2014Yes. Is she alive?\n\n\u2014And kicking.\n\n\u2014She was a daughter of...\n\n\u2014Daughter of the regiment.\n\n\u2014Yes, begad. I remember the old drummajor.\n\nMr Dedalus struck, whizzed, lit, puffed savoury puff after\n\n\u2014Irish? I don't know, faith. Is she, Simon?\n\nPuff after stiff, a puff, strong, savoury, crackling.\n\n\u2014Buccinator muscle is... What?... Bit rusty... O, she is... My Irish Molly, O.\n\nHe puffed a pungent plumy blast.\n\n\u2014From the rock of Gibraltar... all the way.\n\nThey pined in depth of ocean shadow, gold by the beerpull, bronze by maraschino, thoughtful all two. Mina Kennedy, 4 Lismore terrace, Drumcondra with Idolores, a queen, Dolores, silent.\n\nPat served, uncovered dishes. Leopold cut liverslices. As said before he ate with relish the inner organs, nutty gizzards, fried cods' roes while Richie Goulding, Collis, Ward ate steak and kidney, steak then kidney, bite by bite of pie he ate Bloom ate they ate.\n\nBloom with Goulding, married in silence, ate. Dinners fit for princes.\n\nBy Bachelor's walk jogjaunty jingled Blazes Boylan, bachelor, in sun in heat, mare's glossy rump atrot, with flick of whip, on bounding tyres: sprawled, warmseated, Boylan impatience, ardentbold. Horn. Have you the? Horn. Have you the? Haw haw horn.\n\nOver their voices Dollard bassooned attack, booming over bombarding chords:\n\n\u2014When love absorbs my ardent soul...\n\nRoll of Bensoulbenjamin rolled to the quivery loveshivery roofpanes.\n\n\u2014War! War! cried Father Cowley. You're the warrior.\n\n\u2014So I am, Ben Warrior laughed. I was thinking of your landlord. Love or money.\n\nHe stopped. He wagged huge beard, huge face over his blunder huge.\n\n\u2014Sure, you'd burst the tympanum of her ear, man, Mr Dedalus said through smoke aroma, with an organ like yours.\n\nIn bearded abundant laughter Dollard shook upon the keyboard. He would.\n\n\u2014Not to mention another membrane, Father Cowley added. Half time, Ben. Amoroso ma non troppo. Let me there.\n\nMiss Kennedy served two gentlemen with tankards of cool stout. She passed a remark. It was indeed, first gentleman said, beautiful weather. They drank cool stout. Did she know where the lord lieutenant was going? And heard steelhoofs ringhoof ring. No, she couldn't say. But it would be in the paper. O, she need not trouble. No trouble. She waved about her outspread Independent, searching, the lord lieutenant, her pinnacles of hair slowmoving, lord lieuten. Too much trouble, first gentleman said. O, not in the least. Way he looked that. Lord lieutenant. Gold by bronze heard iron steel.\n\n\u2014............ my ardent soul\nI care not foror the morrow.\n\nIn liver gravy Bloom mashed mashed potatoes. Love and War someone is. Ben Dollard's famous. Night he ran round to us to borrow a dress suit for that concert. Trousers tight as a drum on him. Musical porkers. Molly did laugh when he went out. Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O saints above, I'm drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many! Well, of course that's what gives him the base barreltone. For instance eunuchs. Wonder who's playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical. Knows whatever note you play. Bad breath he has, poor chap. Stopped.\n\nMiss Douce, engaging, Lydia Douce, bowed to suave solicitor, George Lidwell, gentleman, entering. Good afternoon. She gave her moist (a lady's) hand to his firm clasp. Afternoon. Yes, she was back. To the old dingdong again.\n\n\u2014Your friends are inside, Mr Lidwell.\n\nGeorge Lidwell, suave, solicited, held a lydiahand.\n\nBloom ate liv as said before. Clean here at least. That chap in the Burton, gummy with gristle. No-one here: Goulding and I. Clean tables, flowers, mitres of napkins. Pat to and fro. Bald Pat. Nothing to do. Best value in Dub.\n\nPiano again. Cowley it is. Way he sits in to it, like one together, mutual understanding. Tiresome shapers scraping fiddles, eye on the bowend, sawing the cello, remind you of toothache. Her high long snore. Night we were in the box. Trombone under blowing like a grampus, between the acts, other brass chap unscrewing, emptying spittle. Conductor's legs too, bagstrousers, jiggedy jiggedy. Do right to hide them.\n\nJiggedy jingle jaunty jaunty.\n\nOnly the harp. Lovely. Gold glowering light. Girl touched it. Poop of a lovely. Gravy's rather good fit for a. Golden ship. Erin. The harp that once or twice. Cool hands. Ben Howth, the rhododendrons. We are their harps. I. He. Old. Young.\n\n\u2014Ah, I couldn't, man, Mr Dedalus said, shy, listless.\n\nStrongly.\n\n\u2014Go on, blast you! Ben Dollard growled. Get it out in bits.\n\n\u2014M'appari, Simon, Father Cowley said.\n\nDown stage he strode some paces, grave, tall in affliction, his long arms outheld. Hoarsely the apple of his throat hoarsed softly. Softly he sang to a dusty seascape there: A Last Farewell. A headland, a ship, a sail upon the billows. Farewell. A lovely girl, her veil awave upon the wind upon the headland, wind around her.\n\nCowley sang:\n\n\u2014M'appari tutt'amor:\nIl mio sguardo l'incontr...\n\nShe waved, unhearing Cowley, her veil, to one departing, dear one, to wind, love, speeding sail, return.\n\n\u2014Go on, Simon.\n\n\u2014Ah, sure, my dancing days are done, Ben... Well...\n\nMr Dedalus laid his pipe to rest beside the tuningfork and, sitting, touched the obedient keys.\n\n\u2014No, Simon, Father Cowley turned. Play it in the original. One flat.\n\nThe keys, obedient, rose higher, told, faltered, confessed, confused.\n\nUp stage strode Father Cowley.\n\n\u2014Here, Simon, I'll accompany you, he said. Get up.\n\nBy Graham Lemon's pineapple rock, by Elvery's elephant jingly jogged. Steak, kidney, liver, mashed, at meat fit for princes sat princes Bloom and Goulding. Princes at meat they raised and drank, Power and cider.\n\nMost beautiful tenor air ever written, Richie said: Sonnambula. He heard Joe Maas sing that one night. Ah, what M'Guckin! Yes. In his way. Choirboy style. Maas was the boy. Massboy. A lyrical tenor if you like. Never forget it. Never.\n\nTenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain. Backache he. Bright's bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile. Sings too: Down among the dead men. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs. And when he's wanted not a farthing. Screwed refusing to pay his fare. Curious types.\n\nNever would Richie forget that night. As long as he lived: never. In the gods of the old Royal with little Peake. And when the first note.\n\nSpeech paused on Richie's lips.\n\nComing out with a whopper now. Rhapsodies about damn all.\n\nBelieves his own lies. Does really. Wonderful liar. But want a good memory.\n\n\u2014Which air is that? asked Leopold Bloom.\n\n\u2014All is lost now.\n\nRichie cocked his lips apout. A low incipient note sweet banshee murmured: all. A thrush. A throstle. His breath, birdsweet, good teeth he's proud of, fluted with plaintive woe. Is lost. Rich sound. Two notes in one there. Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my motives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in all. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.\n\nBloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase. Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air. In sleep she went to him. Innocence in the moon. Brave. Don't know their danger. Still hold her back. Call name. Touch water. Jingle jaunty. Too late. She longed to go. That's why. Woman. As easy stop the sea. Yes: all is lost.\n\n\u2014A beautiful air, said Bloom lost Leopold. I know it well.\n\nNever in all his life had Richie Goulding.\n\nHe knows it well too. Or he feels. Still harping on his daughter. Wise child that knows her father, Dedalus said. Me?\n\nBloom askance over liverless saw. Face of the all is lost. Rollicking Richie once. Jokes old stale now. Wagging his ear. Napkinring in his eye. Now begging letters he sends his son with. Crosseyed Walter sir I did sir. Wouldn't trouble only I was expecting some money. Apologise.\n\nPiano again. Sounds better than last time I heard. Tuned probably. Stopped again.\n\nDollard and Cowley still urged the lingering singer out with it.\n\n\u2014With it, Simon.\n\n\u2014It, Simon.\n\n\u2014Ladies and gentlemen, I am most deeply obliged by your kind solicitations.\n\n\u2014It, Simon.\n\n\u2014I have no money but if you will lend me your attention I shall endeavour to sing to you of a heart bowed down.\n\nBy the sandwichbell in screening shadow Lydia, her bronze and rose, a lady's grace, gave and withheld: as in cool glaucous eau de Nil Mina to tankards two her pinnacles of gold.\n\nThe harping chords of prelude closed. A chord, longdrawn, expectant, drew a voice away.\n\n\u2014When first I saw that form endearing...\n\nRichie turned.\n\n\u2014Si Dedalus' voice, he said.\n\nBraintipped, cheek touched with flame, they listened feeling that flow endearing flow over skin limbs human heart soul spine. Bloom signed to Pat, bald Pat is a waiter hard of hearing, to set ajar the door of the bar. The door of the bar. So. That will do. Pat, waiter, waited, waiting to hear, for he was hard of hear by the door.\n\n\u2014Sorrow from me seemed to depart.\n\nThrough the hush of air a voice sang to them, low, not rain, not leaves in murmur, like no voice of strings or reeds or whatdoyoucallthem dulcimers touching their still ears with words, still hearts of their each his remembered lives. Good, good to hear: sorrow from them each seemed to from both depart when first they heard. When first they saw, lost Richie Poldy, mercy of beauty, heard from a person wouldn't expect it in the least, her first merciful lovesoft oftloved word.\n\nLove that is singing: love's old sweet song. Bloom unwound slowly the elastic band of his packet. Love's old sweet sonnez la gold. Bloom wound a skein round four forkfingers, stretched it, relaxed, and wound it round his troubled double, fourfold, in octave, gyved them fast.\n\n\u2014Full of hope and all delighted...\n\nTenors get women by the score. Increase their flow. Throw flower at his feet. When will we meet? My head it simply. Jingle all delighted. He can't sing for tall hats. Your head it simply swurls. Perfumed for him. What perfume does your wife? I want to know. Jing. Stop. Knock. Last look at mirror always before she answers the door. The hall. There? How do you? I do well. There? What? Or? Phial of cachous, kissing comfits, in her satchel. Yes? Hands felt for the opulent.\n\nAlas the voice rose, sighing, changed: loud, full, shining, proud.\n\n\u2014But alas, 'twas idle dreaming...\n\nGlorious tone he has still. Cork air softer also their brogue. Silly man! Could have made oceans of money. Singing wrong words. Wore out his wife: now sings. But hard to tell. Only the two themselves. If he doesn't break down. Keep a trot for the avenue. His hands and feet sing too. Drink. Nerves overstrung. Must be abstemious to sing. Jenny Lind soup: stock, sage, raw eggs, half pint of cream. For creamy dreamy.\n\nTenderness it welled: slow, swelling, full it throbbed. That's the chat. Ha, give! Take! Throb, a throb, a pulsing proud erect.\n\nWords? Music? No: it's what's behind.\n\nBloom looped, unlooped, noded, disnoded.\n\nBloom. Flood of warm jamjam lickitup secretness flowed to flow in music out, in desire, dark to lick flow invading. Tipping her tepping her tapping her topping her. Tup. Pores to dilate dilating. Tup. The joy the feel the warm the. Tup. To pour o'er sluices pouring gushes. Flood, gush, flow, joygush, tupthrob. Now! Language of love.\n\n\u2014... ray of hope is...\n\nBeaming. Lydia for Lidwell squeak scarcely hear so ladylike the muse unsqueaked a ray of hopk.\n\nMartha it is. Coincidence. Just going to write. Lionel's song. Lovely name you have. Can't write. Accept my little pres. Play on her heartstrings pursestrings too. She's a. I called you naughty boy. Still the name: Martha. How strange! Today.\n\nThe voice of Lionel returned, weaker but unwearied. It sang again to Richie Poldy Lydia Lidwell also sang to Pat open mouth ear waiting to wait. How first he saw that form endearing, how sorrow seemed to part, how look, form, word charmed him Gould Lidwell, won Pat Bloom's heart.\n\nWish I could see his face, though. Explain better. Why the barber in Drago's always looked my face when I spoke his face in the glass. Still hear it better here than in the bar though farther.\n\n\u2014Each graceful look...\n\nFirst night when first I saw her at Mat Dillon's in Terenure. Yellow, black lace she wore. Musical chairs. We two the last. Fate. After her. Fate.\n\nRound and round slow. Quick round. We two. All looked. Halt. Down she sat. All ousted looked. Lips laughing. Yellow knees.\n\n\u2014Charmed my eye...\n\nSinging. Waiting she sang. I turned her music. Full voice of perfume of what perfume does your lilactrees. Bosom I saw, both full, throat warbling. First I saw. She thanked me. Why did she me? Fate. Spanishy eyes. Under a peartree alone patio this hour in old Madrid one side in shadow Dolores shedolores. At me. Luring. Ah, alluring.\n\n\u2014Martha! Ah, Martha!\n\nQuitting all languor Lionel cried in grief, in cry of passion dominant to love to return with deepening yet with rising chords of harmony. In cry of lionel loneliness that she should know, must martha feel. For only her he waited. Where? Here there try there here all try where. Somewhere.\n\n\u2014Co-ome, thou lost one!\nCo-ome, thou dear one!\n\nAlone. One love. One hope. One comfort me. Martha, chestnote, return!\n\n\u2014Come!\n\nIt soared, a bird, it held its flight, a swift pure cry, soar silver orb it leaped serene, speeding, sustained, to come, don't spin it out too long long breath he breath long life, soaring high, high resplendent, aflame, crowned, high in the effulgence symbolistic, high, of the etherial bosom, high, of the high vast irradiation everywhere all soaring all around about the all, the endlessnessnessness...\n\n\u2014To me!\n\nSiopold!\n\nConsumed.\n\nCome. Well sung. All clapped. She ought to. Come. To me, to him, to her, you too, me, us.\n\n\u2014Bravo! Clapclap. Good man, Simon. Clappyclapclap. Encore! Clapclipclap clap. Sound as a bell. Bravo, Simon! Clapclopclap. Encore, enclap, said, cried, clapped all, Ben Dollard, Lydia Douce, George Lidwell, Pat, Mina Kennedy, two gentlemen with two tankards, Cowley, first gent with tank and bronze miss Douce and gold MJiss Mina.\n\nBlazes Boylan's smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor, said before. Jingle by monuments of sir John Gray, Horatio onehandled Nelson, reverend father Theobald Mathew, jaunted, as said before just now. Atrot, in heat, heatseated. Cloche. Sonnez la. Cloche. Sonnez la. Slower the mare went up the hill by the Rotunda, Rutland square. Too slow for Boylan, blazes Boylan, impatience Boylan, joggled the mare.\n\nAn afterclang of Cowley's chords closed, died on the air made richer.\n\nAnd Richie Goulding drank his Power and Leopold Bloom his cider drank, Lidwell his Guinness, second gentleman said they would partake of two more tankards if she did not mind. Miss Kennedy smirked, disserving, coral lips, at first, at second. She did not mind.\n\n\u2014Seven days in jail, Ben Dollard said, on bread and water. Then you'd sing, Simon, like a garden thrush.\n\nLionel Simon, singer, laughed. Father Bob Cowley played. Mina Kennedy served. Second gentleman paid. Tom Kernan strutted in. Lydia, admired, admired. But Bloom sang dumb.\n\nAdmiring.\n\nRichie, admiring, descanted on that man's glorious voice. He remembered one night long ago. Never forget that night. Si sang 'Twas rank and fame: in Ned Lambert's 'twas. Good God he never heard in all his life a note like that he never did then false one we had better part so clear so God he never heard since love lives not a clinking voice lives not ask Lambert he can tell you too.\n\nGoulding, a flush struggling in his pale, told Mr Bloom, face of the night, Si in Ned Lambert's, Dedalus house, sang 'Twas rank and fame.\n\nHe, Mr Bloom, listened while he, Richie Goulding, told him, Mr Bloom, of the night he, Richie, heard him, Si Dedalus, sing 'TWAS RANK AND FAME in his, Ned Lambert's, house.\n\nBrothers-in-law: relations. We never speak as we pass by. Rift in the lute I think. Treats him with scorn. See. He admires him all the more. The night Si sang. The human voice, two tiny silky chords, wonderful, more than all others.\n\nThat voice was a lamentation. Calmer now. It's in the silence after you feel you hear. Vibrations. Now silent air.\n\nBloom ungyved his crisscrossed hands and with slack fingers plucked the slender catgut thong. He drew and plucked. It buzz, it twanged. While Goulding talked of Barraclough's voice production, while Tom Kernan, harking back in a retrospective sort of arrangement talked to listening Father Cowley, who played a voluntary, who nodded as he played. While big Ben Dollard talked with Simon Dedalus, lighting, who nodded as he smoked, who smoked.\n\nThou lost one. All songs on that theme. Yet more Bloom stretched his string. Cruel it seems. Let people get fond of each other: lure them on. Then tear asunder. Death. Explos. Knock on the head. Outtohelloutofthat. Human life. Dignam. Ugh, that rat's tail wriggling! Five bob I gave. Corpus paradisum. Corncrake croaker: belly like a poisoned pup. Gone. They sing. Forgotten. I too; And one day she with. Leave her: get tired. Suffer then. Snivel. Big spanishy eyes goggling at nothing. Her wavyavyeavyheavyeavyevyevyhair un comb:'d.\n\nYet too much happy bores. He stretched more, more. Are you not happy in your? Twang. It snapped.\n\nJingle into Dorset street.\n\nMiss Douce withdrew her satiny arm, reproachful, pleased.\n\n\u2014Don't make half so free, said she, till we are better acquainted.\n\nGeorge Lidwell told her really and truly: but she did not believe.\n\nFirst gentleman told Mina that was so. She asked him was that so. And second tankard told her so. That that was so.\n\nMiss Douce, miss Lydia, did not believe: miss Kennedy, Mina, did not believe: George Lidwell, no: miss Dou did not: the first, the first: gent with the tank: believe, no, no: did not, miss Kenn: Lidlydiawell: the tank.\n\nBetter write it here. Quills in the postoffice chewed and twisted.\n\nBald Pat at a sign drew nigh. A pen and ink. He went. A pad. He went. A pad to blot. He heard, deaf Pat.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said, teasing the curling catgut line. It certainly is. Few lines will do. My present. All that Italian florid music is. Who is this wrote? Know the name you know better. Take out sheet notepaper, envelope: unconcerned. It's so characteristic.\n\n\u2014Grandest number in the whole opera, Goulding said.\n\n\u2014It is, Bloom said.\n\nNumbers it is. All music when you come to think. Two multiplied by two divided by half is twice one. Vibrations: chords those are. One plus two plus six is seven. Do anything you like with figures juggling. Always find out this equal to that. Symmetry under a cemetery wall. He doesn't see my mourning. Callous: all for his own gut. Musemathematics. And you think you're listening to the etherial. But suppose you said it like: Martha, seven times nine minus x is thirtyfive thousand. Fall quite flat. It's on account of the sounds it is.\n\nInstance he's playing now. Improvising. Might be what you like, till you hear the words. Want to listen sharp. Hard. Begin all right: then hear chords a bit off: feel lost a bit. In and out of sacks, over barrels, through wirefences, obstacle race. Time makes the tune. Question of mood you're in. Still always nice to hear. Except scales up and down, girls learning. Two together nextdoor neighbours. Ought to invent dummy pianos for that. Blumenlied I bought for her. The name. Playing it slow, a girl, night I came home, the girl. Door of the stables near Cecilia street. Milly no taste. Queer because we both, I mean.\n\nBald deaf Pat brought quite flat pad ink. Pat set with ink pen quite flat pad. Pat took plate dish knife fork. Pat went.\n\nIt was the only language Mr Dedalus said to Ben. He heard them as a boy in Ringabella, Crosshaven, Ringabella, singing their barcaroles. Queenstown harbour full of Italian ships. Walking, you know, Ben, in the moonlight with those earthquake hats. Blending their voices. God, such music, Ben. Heard as a boy. Cross Ringabella haven mooncarole.\n\nSour pipe removed he held a shield of hand beside his lips that cooed a moonlight nightcall, clear from anear, a call from afar, replying.\n\nDown the edge of his Freeman baton ranged Bloom's, your other eye, scanning for where did I see that. Callan, Coleman, Dignam Patrick. Heigho! Heigho! Fawcett. Aha! Just I was looking...\n\nHope he's not looking, cute as a rat. He held unfurled his Freeman. Can't see now. Remember write Greek ees. Bloom dipped, Bloo mur: dear sir. Dear Henry wrote: dear Mady. Got your lett and flow. Hell did I put? Some pock or oth. It is utterl imposs. Underline imposs. To write today.\n\nBore this. Bored Bloom tambourined gently with I am just reflecting fingers on flat pad Pat brought.\n\nOn. Know what I mean. No, change that ee. Accep my poor litt pres enclos. Ask her no answ. Hold on. Five Dig. Two about here. Penny the gulls. Elijah is com. Seven Davy Byrne's. Is eight about. Say half a crown. My poor little pres: p. o. two and six. Write me a long. Do you despise? Jingle, have you the? So excited. Why do you call me naught? You naughty too? O, Mairy lost the string of her. Bye for today. Yes, yes, will tell you. Want to. To keep it up. Call me that other. Other world she wrote. My patience are exhaust. To keep it up. You must believe. Believe. The tank. It. Is. True.\n\nFolly am I writing? Husbands don't. That's marriage does, their wives. Because I'm away from. Suppose. But how? She must. Keep young. If she found out. Card in my high grade ha. No, not tell all. Useless pain. If they don't see. Woman. Sauce for the gander.\n\nA hackney car, number three hundred and twentyfour, driver Barton James of number one Harmony avenue, Donnybrook, on which sat a fare, a young gentleman, stylishly dressed in an indigoblue serge suit made by George Robert Mesias, tailor and cutter, of number five Eden quay, and wearing a straw hat very dressy, bought of John Plasto of number one Great Brunswick street, hatter. Eh? This is the jingle that joggled and jingled. By Dlugacz' porkshop bright tubes of Agendath trotted a gallantbuttocked mare.\n\n\u2014Answering an ad? keen Richie's eyes asked Bloom.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said. Town traveller. Nothing doing, I expect.\n\nBloom mur: best references. But Henry wrote: it will excite me. You know how. In haste. Henry. Greek ee. Better add postscript. What is he playing now? Improvising. Intermezzo. P. S. The rum tum tum. How will you pun? You punish me? Crooked skirt swinging, whack by. Tell me I want to. Know. O. Course if I didn't I wouldn't ask. La la la ree. Trails off there sad in minor. Why minor sad? Sign H. They like sad tail at end. P. P. S. La la la ree. I feel so sad today. La ree. So lonely. Dee.\n\nHe blotted quick on pad of Pat. Envel. Address. Just copy out of paper. Murmured: Messrs Callan, Coleman and Co, limited. Henry wrote:\n\nMiss Martha Clifford c/o P. O. Dolphin's Barn Lane Dublin\n\nBlot over the other so he can't read. There. Right. Idea prize titbit. Something detective read off blottingpad. Payment at the rate of guinea per col. Matcham often thinks the laughing witch. Poor Mrs Purefoy. U. P: up.\n\nToo poetical that about the sad. Music did that. Music hath charms. Shakespeare said. Quotations every day in the year. To be or not to be. Wisdom while you wait.\n\nIn Gerard's rosery of Fetter lane he walks, greyedauburn. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.\n\nDone anyhow. Postal order, stamp. Postoffice lower down. Walk now. Enough. Barney Kiernan's I promised to meet them. Dislike that job.\n\nHouse of mourning. Walk. Pat! Doesn't hear. Deaf beetle he is.\n\nCar near there now. Talk. Talk. Pat! Doesn't. Settling those napkins. Lot of ground he must cover in the day. Paint face behind on him then he'd be two. Wish they'd sing more. Keep my mind off.\n\nBald Pat who is bothered mitred the napkins. Pat is a waiter hard of his hearing. Pat is a waiter who waits while you wait. Hee hee hee hee. He waits while you wait. Hee hee. A waiter is he. Hee hee hee hee. He waits while you wait. While you wait if you wait he will wait while you wait. Hee hee hee hee. Hoh. Wait while you wait.\n\nDouce now. Douce Lydia. Bronze and rose.\n\nShe had a gorgeous, simply gorgeous, time. And look at the lovely shell she brought.\n\nTo the end of the bar to him she bore lightly the spiked and winding seahorn that he, George Lidwell, solicitor, might hear.\n\n\u2014Listen! she bade him.\n\nUnder Tom Kernan's ginhot words the accompanist wove music slow. Authentic fact. How Walter Bapty lost his voice. Well, sir, the husband took him by the throat. Scoundrel, said he, You'll sing no more lovesongs. He did, faith, sir Tom. Bob Cowley wove. Tenors get wom. Cowley lay back.\n\nAh, now he heard, she holding it to his ear. Hear! He heard.\n\nWonderful. She held it to her own. And through the sifted light pale gold in contrast glided. To hear.\n\nTap.\n\nBloom through the bardoor saw a shell held at their ears. He heard more faintly that that they heard, each for herself alone, then each for other, hearing the plash of waves, loudly, a silent roar.\n\nBronze by a weary gold, anear, afar, they listened.\n\nHer ear too is a shell, the peeping lobe there. Been to the seaside. Lovely seaside girls. Skin tanned raw. Should have put on coldcream first make it brown. Buttered toast. O and that lotion mustn't forget. Fever near her mouth. Your head it simply. Hair braided over: shell with seaweed. Why do they hide their ears with seaweed hair? And Turks the mouth, why? Her eyes over the sheet. Yashmak. Find the way in. A cave. No admittance except on business.\n\nThe sea they think they hear. Singing. A roar. The blood it is. Souse in the ear sometimes. Well, it's a sea. Corpuscle islands.\n\nWonderful really. So distinct. Again. George Lidwell held its murmur, hearing: then laid it by, gently.\n\n\u2014What are the wild waves saying? he asked her, smiled.\n\nCharming, seasmiling and unanswering Lydia on Lidwell smiled.\n\nTap.\n\nBy Larry O'Rourke's, by Larry, bold Larry O', Boylan swayed and Boylan turned.\n\nFrom the forsaken shell miss Mina glided to her tankards waiting. No, she was not so lonely archly miss Douce's head let Mr Lidwell know. Walks in the moonlight by the sea. No, not alone. With whom? She nobly answered: with a gentleman friend.\n\nBob Cowley's twinkling fingers in the treble played again. The landlord has the prior. A little time. Long John. Big Ben. Lightly he played a light bright tinkling measure for tripping ladies, arch and smiling, and for their gallants, gentlemen friends. One: one, one, one, one, one: two, one, three, four.\n\nSea, wind, leaves, thunder, waters, cows lowing, the cattlemarket, cocks, hens don't crow, snakes hissss. There's music everywhere. Ruttledge's door: ee creaking. No, that's noise. Minuet of Don Giovanni he's playing now. Court dresses of all descriptions in castle chambers dancing. Misery. Peasants outside. Green starving faces eating dockleaves. Nice that is. Look: look, look, look, look, look: you look at us.\n\nThat's joyful I can feel. Never have written it. Why? My joy is other joy. But both are joys. Yes, joy it must be. Mere fact of music shows you are. Often thought she was in the dumps till she began to lilt. Then know.\n\nM'Coy valise. My wife and your wife. Squealing cat. Like tearing silk. Tongue when she talks like the clapper of a bellows. They can't manage men's intervals. Gap in their voices too. Fill me. I'm warm, dark, open. Molly in quis est homo: Mercadante. My ear against the wall to hear. Want a woman who can deliver the goods.\n\nJog jig jogged stopped. Dandy tan shoe of dandy Boylan socks skyblue clocks came light to earth.\n\nO, look we are so! Chamber music. Could make a kind of pun on that. It is a kind of music I often thought when she. Acoustics that is. Tinkling. Empty vessels make most noise. Because the acoustics, the resonance changes according as the weight of the water is equal to the law of falling water. Like those rhapsodies of Liszt's, Hungarian, gipsyeyed. Pearls. Drops. Rain. Diddleiddle addleaddle ooddleooddle. Hissss. Now. Maybe now. Before.\n\nOne rapped on a door, one tapped with a knock, did he knock Paul de Kock with a loud proud knocker with a cock carracarracarra cock. Cockcock.\n\nTap.\n\n\u2014Qui sdegno, Ben, said Father Cowley.\n\n\u2014No, Ben, Tom Kernan interfered. The Croppy Boy. Our native Doric.\n\n\u2014Ay do, Ben, Mr Dedalus said. Good men and true.\n\n\u2014Do, do, they begged in one.\n\nI'll go. Here, Pat, return. Come. He came, he came, he did not stay. To me. How much?\n\n\u2014What key? Six sharps?\n\n\u2014F sharp major, Ben Dollard said.\n\nBob Cowley's outstretched talons griped the black deepsounding chords.\n\nMust go prince Bloom told Richie prince. No, Richie said. Yes, must. Got money somewhere. He's on for a razzle backache spree. Much? He seehears lipspeech. One and nine. Penny for yourself. Here. Give him twopence tip. Deaf, bothered. But perhaps he has wife and family waiting, waiting Patty come home. Hee hee hee hee. Deaf wait while they wait.\n\nBut wait. But hear. Chords dark. Lugugugubrious. Low. In a cave of the dark middle earth. Embedded ore. Lumpmusic.\n\nThe voice of dark age, of unlove, earth's fatigue made grave approach and painful, come from afar, from hoary mountains, called on good men and true. The priest he sought. With him would he speak a word.\n\nTap.\n\nBen Dollard's voice. Base barreltone. Doing his level best to say it. Croak of vast manless moonless womoonless marsh. Other comedown. Big ships' chandler's business he did once. Remember: rosiny ropes, ships' lanterns. Failed to the tune of ten thousand pounds. Now in the Iveagh home. Cubicle number so and so. Number one Bass did that for him.\n\nThe priest's at home. A false priest's servant bade him welcome. Step in. The holy father. With bows a traitor servant. Curlycues of chords.\n\nRuin them. Wreck their lives. Then build them cubicles to end their days in. Hushaby. Lullaby. Die, dog. Little dog, die.\n\nThe voice of warning, solemn warning, told them the youth had entered a lonely hall, told them how solemn fell his footsteps there, told them the gloomy chamber, the vested priest sitting to shrive.\n\nDecent soul. Bit addled now. Thinks he'll win in Answers, poets' picture puzzle. We hand you crisp five pound note. Bird sitting hatching in a nest. Lay of the last minstrel he thought it was. See blank tee what domestic animal? Tee dash ar most courageous mariner. Good voice he has still. No eunuch yet with all his belongings.\n\nListen. Bloom listened. Richie Goulding listened. And by the door deaf Pat, bald Pat, tipped Pat, listened. The chords harped slower.\n\nThe voice of penance and of grief came slow, embellished, tremulous. Ben's contrite beard confessed. in nomine Domini, in God's name he knelt. He beat his hand upon his breast, confessing: mea culpa.\n\nLatin again. That holds them like birdlime. Priest with the communion corpus for those women. Chap in the mortuary, coffin or coffey, corpusnomine. Wonder where that rat is by now. Scrape.\n\nTap.\n\nThey listened. Tankards and miss Kennedy. George Lidwell, eyelid well expressive, fullbusted satin. Kernan. Si.\n\nThe sighing voice of sorrow sang. His sins. Since Easter he had cursed three times. You bitch's bast. And once at masstime he had gone to play. Once by the churchyard he had passed and for his mother's rest he had not prayed. A boy. A croppy boy.\n\nBronze, listening, by the beerpull gazed far away. Soulfully. Doesn't half know I'm. Molly great dab at seeing anyone looking.\n\nBronze gazed far sideways. Mirror there. Is that best side of her face? They always know. Knock at the door. Last tip to titivate.\n\nCockcarracarra.\n\nWhat do they think when they hear music? Way to catch rattlesnakes. Night Michael Gunn gave us the box. Tuning up. Shah of Persia liked that best. Remind him of home sweet home. Wiped his nose in curtain too. Custom his country perhaps. That's music too. Not as bad as it sounds. Tootling. Brasses braying asses through uptrunks. Doublebasses helpless, gashes in their sides. Woodwinds mooing cows. Semigrand open crocodile music hath jaws. Woodwind like Goodwin's name.\n\nShe looked fine. Her crocus dress she wore lowcut, belongings on show. Clove her breath was always in theatre when she bent to ask a question. Told her what Spinoza says in that book of poor papa's. Hypnotised, listening. Eyes like that. She bent. Chap in dresscircle staring down into her with his operaglass for all he was worth. Beauty of music you must hear twice. Nature woman half a look. God made the country man the tune. Met him pike hoses. Philosophy. O rocks!\n\nAll gone. All fallen. At the siege of Ross his father, at Gorey all his brothers fell. To Wexford, we are the boys of Wexford, he would. Last of his name and race.\n\nI too. Last of my race. Milly young student. Well, my fault perhaps. No son. Rudy. Too late now. Or if not? If not? If still?\n\nHe bore no hate.\n\nHate. Love. Those are names. Rudy. Soon I am old. Big Ben his voice unfolded. Great voice Richie Goulding said, a flush struggling in his pale, to Bloom soon old. But when was young?\n\nIreland comes now. My country above the king. She listens. Who fears to speak of nineteen four? Time to be shoving. Looked enough.\n\n\u2014Bless me, father, Dollard the croppy cried. Bless me and let me go.\n\nTap.\n\nBloom looked, unblessed to go. Got up to kill: on eighteen bob a week. Fellows shell out the dibs. Want to keep your weathereye open. Those girls, those lovely. By the sad sea waves. Chorusgirl's romance. Letters read out for breach of promise. From Chickabiddy's owny Mumpsypum. Laughter in court. Henry. I never signed it. The lovely name you.\n\nLow sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest rustling soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all by heart. The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.\n\nTap. Tap.\n\nThrilled she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.\n\nBlank face. Virgin should say: or fingered only. Write something on it: page. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. Keeps them young. Even admire themselves. See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white woman, a flute alive. Blow gentle. Loud. Three holes, all women. Goddess I didn't see. They want it. Not too much polite. That's why he gets them. Gold in your pocket, brass in your face. Say something. Make her hear. With look to look. Songs without words. Molly, that hurdygurdy boy. She knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because so like the Spanish. Understand animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift of nature.\n\nVentriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?\n\nWill? You? I. Want. You. To.\n\nWith hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed, swelling in apoplectic bitch's bastard. A good thought, boy, to come. One hour's your time to live, your last.\n\nTap. Tap.\n\nThrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear for martyrs that want to, dying to, die. For all things dying, for all things born. Poor Mrs Purefoy. Hope she's over. Because their wombs.\n\nA liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly, hearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On yonder river. At each slow satiny heaving bosom's wave (her heaving embon) red rose rose slowly sank red rose. Heartbeats: her breath: breath that is life. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.\n\nBut look. The bright stars fade. O rose! Castile. The morn. Ha. Lidwell. For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See her from here though. Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.\n\nOn the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand, lightly, plumply, leave it to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to: to, fro: over the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and finger passed in pity: passed, reposed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding ring.\n\nWith a cock with a carra.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\nI hold this house. Amen. He gnashed in fury. Traitors swing.\n\nThe chords consented. Very sad thing. But had to be. Get out before the end. Thanks, that was heavenly. Where's my hat. Pass by her. Can leave that Freeman. Letter I have. Suppose she were the? No. Walk, walk, walk. Like Cashel Boylo Connoro Coylo Tisdall Maurice Tisntdall Farrell. Waaaaaaalk.\n\nWell, I must be. Are you off? Yrfmstbyes. Blmstup. O'er ryehigh blue. Ow. Bloom stood up. Soap feeling rather sticky behind. Must have sweated: music. That lotion, remember. Well, so long. High grade. Card inside. Yes.\n\nBy deaf Pat in the doorway straining ear Bloom passed.\n\nAt Geneva barrack that young man died. At Passage was his body laid. Dolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to dolorous prayer.\n\nBy rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties, by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap.\n\nPray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard. You who hear in peace. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people. He was the croppy boy.\n\nScaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway heard the growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all treading, boots not the boots the boy. General chorus off for a swill to wash it down. Glad I avoided.\n\n\u2014Come on, Ben, Simon Dedalus cried. By God, you're as good as ever you were.\n\n\u2014Better, said Tomgin Kernan. Most trenchant rendition of that ballad, upon my soul and honour It is.\n\n\u2014Lablache, said Father Cowley.\n\nBen Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed and all big roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering castagnettes in the air.\n\nBig Benaben Dollard. Big Benben. Big Benben.\n\nRrr.\n\nAnd deepmoved all, Simon trumping compassion from foghorn nose, all laughing they brought him forth, Ben Dollard, in right good cheer.\n\n\u2014You're looking rubicund, George Lidwell said.\n\nMiss Douce composed her rose to wait.\n\n\u2014Ben machree, said Mr Dedalus, clapping Ben's fat back shoulderblade. Fit as a fiddle only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his person.\n\nRrrrrrrsss.\n\n\u2014Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled.\n\nRichie rift in the lute alone sat: Goulding, Collis, Ward. Uncertainly he waited. Unpaid Pat too.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\n\nMiss Mina Kennedy brought near her lips to ear of tankard one.\n\n\u2014Mr Dollard, they murmured low.\n\n\u2014Dollard, murmured tankard.\n\nTank one believed: miss Kenn when she: that doll he was: she doll: the tank.\n\nHe murmured that he knew the name. The name was familiar to him, that is to say. That was to say he had heard the name of. Dollard, was it? Dollard, yes.\n\nYes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely, murmured Mina. Mr Dollard. And The last rose of summer was a lovely song. Mina loved that song. Tankard loved the song that Mina.\n\n'Tis the last rose of summer dollard left bloom felt wind wound round inside.\n\nGassy thing that cider: binding too. Wait. Postoffice near Reuben J's one and eightpence too. Get shut of it. Dodge round by Greek street. Wish I hadn't promised to meet. Freer in air. Music. Gets on your nerves. Beerpull. Her hand that rocks the cradle rules the. Ben Howth. That rules the world.\n\nFar. Far. Far. Far.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\n\nUp the quay went Lionelleopold, naughty Henry with letter for Mady, with sweets of sin with frillies for Raoul with met him pike hoses went Poldy on.\n\nTap blind walked tapping by the tap the curbstone tapping, tap by tap.\n\nCowley, he stuns himself with it: kind of drunkenness. Better give way only half way the way of a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All ears. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time. Dotty. You daren't budge. Thinking strictly prohibited. Always talking shop. Fiddlefaddle about notes.\n\nAll a kind of attempt to talk. Unpleasant when it stops because you never know exac. Organ in Gardiner street. Old Glynn fifty quid a year. Queer up there in the cockloft, alone, with stops and locks and keys. Seated all day at the organ. Maunder on for hours, talking to himself or the other fellow blowing the bellows. Growl angry, then shriek cursing (want to have wadding or something in his no don't she cried), then all of a soft sudden wee little wee little pipy wind.\n\nPwee! A wee little wind piped eeee. In Bloom's little wee.\n\n\u2014Was he? Mr Dedalus said, returning with fetched pipe. I was with him this morning at poor little Paddy Dignam's...\n\n\u2014Ay, the Lord have mercy on him.\n\n\u2014By the bye there's a tuningfork in there on the...\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\n\n\u2014The wife has a fine voice. Or had. What? Lidwell asked.\n\n\u2014O, that must be the tuner, Lydia said to Simonlionel first I saw, forgot it when he was here.\n\nBlind he was she told George Lidwell second I saw. And played so exquisitely, treat to hear. Exquisite contrast: bronzelid, minagold.\n\n\u2014Shout! Ben Dollard shouted, pouring. Sing out!\n\n\u2014'lldo! cried Father Cowley.\n\nRrrrrr.\n\nI feel I want...\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap\n\n\u2014Very, Mr Dedalus said, staring hard at a headless sardine.\n\nUnder the sandwichbell lay on a bier of bread one last, one lonely, last sardine of summer. Bloom alone.\n\n\u2014Very, he stared. The lower register, for choice.\n\nTap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.\n\nBloom went by Barry's. Wish I could. Wait. That wonderworker if I had. Twentyfour solicitors in that one house. Counted them. Litigation. Love one another. Piles of parchment. Messrs Pick and Pocket have power of attorney. Goulding, Collis, Ward.\n\nBut for example the chap that wallops the big drum. His vocation: Mickey Rooney's band. Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at home after pig's cheek and cabbage nursing it in the armchair. Rehearsing his band part. Pom. Pompedy. Jolly for the wife. Asses' skins. Welt them through life, then wallop after death. Pom. Wallop. Seems to be what you call yashmak or I mean kismet. Fate.\n\nTap. Tap. A stripling, blind, with a tapping cane came taptaptapping by Daly's window where a mermaid hair all streaming (but he couldn't see) blew whiffs of a mermaid (blind couldn't), mermaid, coolest whiff of all.\n\nInstruments. A blade of grass, shell of her hands, then blow. Even comb and tissuepaper you can knock a tune out of. Molly in her shift in Lombard street west, hair down. I suppose each kind of trade made its own, don't you see? Hunter with a horn. Haw. Have you the? Cloche. Sonnez la. Shepherd his pipe. Pwee little wee. Policeman a whistle. Locks and keys! Sweep! Four o'clock's all's well! Sleep! All is lost now. Drum? Pompedy. Wait. I know. Towncrier, bumbailiff. Long John. Waken the dead. Pom. Dignam. Poor little nominedomine. Pom. It is music. I mean of course it's all pom pom pom very much what they call da capo. Still you can hear. As we march, we march along, march along. Pom.\n\nI must really. Fff. Now if I did that at a banquet. Just a question of custom shah of Persia. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear. All the same he must have been a bit of a natural not to see it was a yeoman cap. Muffled up. Wonder who was that chap at the grave in the brown macin. O, the whore of the lane!\n\nA frowsy whore with black straw sailor hat askew came glazily in the day along the quay towards Mr Bloom. When first he saw that form endearing? Yes, it is. I feel so lonely. Wet night in the lane. Horn. Who had the? Heehaw shesaw. Off her beat here. What is she? Hope she. Psst! Any chance of your wash. Knew Molly. Had me decked. Stout lady does be with you in the brown costume. Put you off your stroke, that. Appointment we made knowing we'd never, well hardly ever. Too dear too near to home sweet home. Sees me, does she? Looks a fright in the day. Face like dip. Damn her. O, well, she has to live like the rest. Look in here.\n\nIn Lionel Marks's antique saleshop window haughty Henry Lionel Leopold dear Henry Flower earnestly Mr Leopold Bloom envisaged battered candlesticks melodeon oozing maggoty blowbags. Bargain: six bob. Might learn to play. Cheap. Let her pass. Course everything is dear if you don't want it. That's what good salesman is. Make you buy what he wants to sell. Chap sold me the Swedish razor he shaved me with. Wanted to charge me for the edge he gave it. She's passing now. Six bob.\n\nMust be the cider or perhaps the burgund.\n\nNear bronze from anear near gold from afar they chinked their clinking glasses all, brighteyed and gallant, before bronze Lydia's tempting last rose of summer, rose of Castile. First Lid, De, Cow, Ker, Doll, a fifth: Lidwell, Si Dedalus, Bob Cowley, Kernan and big Ben Dollard.\nTap. A youth entered a lonely Ormond hall.\n\nBloom viewed a gallant pictured hero in Lionel Marks's window. Robert Emmet's last words. Seven last words. Of Meyerbeer that is.\n\n\u2014True men like you men.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, Ben.\n\n\u2014Will lift your glass with us.\n\nThey lifted.\n\nTschink. Tschunk.\n\nTip. An unseeing stripling stood in the door. He saw not bronze. He saw not gold. Nor Ben nor Bob nor Tom nor Si nor George nor tanks nor Richie nor Pat. Hee hee hee hee. He did not see.\n\nSeabloom, greaseabloom viewed last words. Softly. When my country takes her place among.\n\nPrrprr.\n\nMust be the bur.\n\nFff! Oo. Rrpr.\n\nNations of the earth. No-one behind. She's passed. Then and not till then. Tram kran kran kran. Good oppor. Coming. Krandlkrankran. I'm sure it's the burgund. Yes. One, two. Let my epitaph be. Kraaaaaa. Written. I have.\n\nPprrpffrrppffff.\n\nDone.4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1767232", "artist_names": "Al Jarreau", "full_title": "Breakin' Away

knife\nYou gave me my life\nLike a gush of wind in my hair\nWhy do we forget what's been said\nAnd play the game of life with our hearts?\nI may cry someday\nBut the tears will dry whichever way\nAnd when our hearts return to ashes\nIt'll be just a story\nIt'll be just a story\n[Chorus]\nAi-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh-ahooh\n\n[Verse 2]\n\"I knew a girl who tried to walk across the

(Phoebe playfully shows Ben the shoes) \"Just do it.\" (Ben starts crying) Oh my God, oh, okay, was that too much pressure for him?\n\nCHANDLER: You know, it's...something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.\n\nJOEY: I gotta get one, too.\n\nROSS: What are you guys doing?\n\nCHANDLER: We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?\nROSS: Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.\n\nJOEY: Yeah, we know, but there's a baby sucking on it.\n\nROSS: This is my son having lunch, okay? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.\n\nCHANDLER: Carol, Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?\n\nCAROL: Sure.\n\nJOEY: Uh, does it hurt?\n\nCAROL: It did at first, but not anymore.\n\nJOEY: Chandler?\n\nCHANDLER: So, uh, how often can you do it?\n\nCAROL: As much as he needs.\n\nJOEY: Okay, I got one, I got one.

Reaffirms his faith.\n\nPHOEBE: Ben, dinner!\n\nROSS: Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.\n\nPHOEBE: Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Okay.\n\nCHANDLER: What did you just do?\n\nPHOEBE: I licked my arm, what?\n\nROSS: It's breast milk.\n\nPHOEBE: So?\n\nRACHEL: Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.\n\nJOEY: What is the big deal?\n\nCHANDLER: What did you just do?\n\nROSS: Okay, would people stop drinking the breast milk?\n\nPHOEBE: You won't even taste it?\n\nROSS: No!\n\nPHOEBE: Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?\n\nROSS: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.\n\nMONICA: Hey, where is everybody?\n\nRACHEL: They took Ben to the park. Where have you been?\n\nMONICA: Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.\n\nRACHEL: Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon. Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?\n\nMONICA: You know what probably happened? Someone must've stolen my credit card.\n\nRACHEL: And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket\n\nMONICA: That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.\n\nRACHEL: Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?\n\nMONICA: Judy.\n\nRACHEL: Who?\n\nMONICA: Julie.\n\nRACHEL: What?\n\nMONICA: Jody.\n\nRACHEL: You were with Julie?\n\nMONICA: Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.\n\nRACHEL: Oh. Oh my god.\n\nMONICA: Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.\n\nRACHEL: Yeah, right.\n\nMONICA: Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out.\n\nRACHEL: Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.\n\nMONICA: That is not true!\n\nRACHEL: Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?\n\nMONICA: Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?\n\nRACHEL: Okay, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdales? Oh! Okay, okay, okay, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.\n\nMONICA: Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, okay? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.\n\nCAROL: How did we do?\n\nPHOEBE: Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.\n\nROSS: I did not freak out.\n\nCAROL: Why'd you freak out?\n\nROSS: Because it's breast milk. It's gross.\n\nCAROL: My breast milk is gross?\n\nSUSAN: This should be fun.\n\nROSS: No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults.\n\nCHANDLER: Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.\n\nCAROL: Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it.\n\nROSS: That would be no.\n\nPHOEBE: Come on. It doesn't taste bad.\n\nJOEY: Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh--\n\nSUSAN: Cantaloupe juice.\n\nJOEY: Exactly.\n\nROSS: You've tasted it? You've tasted it.\n\nSUSAN: Uh huh.\n\nROSS: Oh, you've tasted it.\n\nSUSAN: You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.\n\nROSS: Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.\nCHANDLER: Howdy.\n\nJOEY: Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.\n\nCHANDLER: Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.\n\nJOEY: Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.\n\nCHANDLER: What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.\n\nJOEY: I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.\n\nCHANDLER: All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?\n\nJOEY: Yeah I guess you're right.\n\nCHANDLER: You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.\n\nJOEY: I'm gonna do it.\n\nCHANDLER: All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.\nMONICA: I don't know what else to say.\n\nRACHEL: Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.\n\nMONICA: I feel terrible, I really do.\n\nRACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?\n\nMONICA: Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?\n\nRACHEL: Yes.\n\nMONICA: It's that terrible?\n\nRACHEL: Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually, but now she's actually stealing you.\n\nMONICA: Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.\n\nRACHEL: I love you too.\n\nPHOEBE: You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.\n\nMONICA: Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?\n\nRACHEL: I'd do anything for you, you know that.\n\nMONICA: I'd do anything for you.\n\nPHOEBE: Wait, wait, wait, wait!\nJOEY: Morning. (No response from Todd) I said, morning.\n\nTODD: I heard ya.\n\nSTORE GUY: All right, everybody, I'm opening the doors. You boys ready?\n\nTODD: Ready.\n\nJOEY: Yeah, I'm ready. (Store Guy opens the door, Customer arrives, Joey can't get his bottle to spray, Todd accidentally sprays Customer in the eye)\n\nCUSTOMER: You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!\n\nSTORE GUY: Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?\n\nTODD: I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.\n\nANNABELLE: My god, what happened?\n\nJOEY: These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lasting. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?\n\nANNABELLE: Sure.\nJULIE: So.\n\nRACHEL: So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?\n\nJULIE: I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.\n\nRACHEL: Really? Me?\n\nJULIE: Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.\n\nRACHEL: Well, you're not totally paranoid.\n\nJULIE: Oy.\n\nRACHEL: Um, okay, uh, oh God, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.\n\nJULIE: Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?\n\nRACHEL: Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.\n\nJULIE: I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.\n\nRACHEL: All right, Julie. What a manipulative bitch.\nCLOSING CREDITS\n\n(Monica & Rachel's apartment: Ross is endlessly staring at a bottle with a plate of Oreos; Chandler and Joey are sitting in boredom; Ross finally drinks some of the milk and stuffs two Oreos in his mouth)\n\nROSS: It's not bad.\nENDEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/14458", "artist_names": "Company Flow",

right\nThere lived a king who sang a swan song of afternoons and home life\nWell he was found lost, murdered a mile away in yards and turnpikes\nGod bless little Lune TNS who got in him inhaling a few migraines\nHe stays on the shells and denims\nBeyond his wildest fantasies never really thought he'd be drilling 'em\nBut ah, BS119 and wore black TVS and a long purple robe\nSnatched up should portray his weapon\nForever flood the maddened chains and keep the revelations guessing\nWhether through mind over matter meditation\nSelf actualization or even zoning out through deep relaxation\nYo, I came across grown men too scared to dream\nI bypassed them as a child with a staff on the south side of Queens\nWhere the wild ones eye the title but sat idle\nOnly thought was attain luxury, like the elevation wasn't vital\nTo keep pace with a crew that rallied back then, I'm treacherous\nAnd willpower exploded stars out the path of nexuses\nA true rebel who's, like, technically inclined to\nAttract wannabe scientifical gold diggers and forty-niners\nEmpower you or strangle your ass like with the grapevine\nI'm never out for the fame whereas I was told to bring fame to my name\nAnd keep motivated on the down low\nLike a northbound Jersey packed train, apart from this\nMy crew, tight-knit circle with arsonists quick to set it\nLike the rain forest gon' get chopped down regardless to who you are\nIf you ain't really witness the invisible\nThe clairvoyant rhyme prism, the tech hold arson as a missile\nIt's like, as I approach the two three [?] destined to blow\nStill one sixteenth of a gram is critical when it enters, so\nIt's the classic underground styles of the urban masters\nThe krazy kings three-finger caps and sparking tags wit\n(x4, alternating Bigg Jus, El-P)\n\n[El-P]\n\nShit, I feel asphyxiated\nI wear the city air like wet leather\nAlone, though the populace dwells so closely together\nAlarmingly dependent on technology I was raised on as a child to keep me one\nTrying to outrun white noise from my TV keeps me numb\nMr. Disgusted, fortified, ill as confunksion\nGod's son, not a martyr but a fresh working member of a collective\nWho travel through the blazing light as my corpse is dissected\nCell pack, give 'em a little something extra on the set\nLicking a slug at Brandon Lee just to be offensive like Tet\nTold the redbone you can't comprehend, sex alone can't fulfill me\nJust cause I'm p-noid don't mean the government's not trying to kill me\nThe krazy king to whom even himself remains anonymous\nFrom conditioning to remnants of sarcasm and broken promises\nTo myself, born to be the b-boy of stealth clashes\nWho plot a point on the graph for every crab that he harrasses\nCitizens blitzkrieg nihilistic heart of dark euthanasia\nFifty thousand pen and pain phrase in alphabetical arrangement\nCaught a CAT scan to color print my delusion and frame it\nBattle my old pseudonym with a quote from Cold Fusion explain shit\nBefore the three wheels sink the target\nI'mma get a new life market, with bells on\nBut can only seem to fall all over harlots and sirens\nAnd ignore those who really love me\nWho in truth embody the rarity of true starlets\nMy man had a humor at his expense that made him gentle\nWe played backgammon all night\nSmoking Kool cigs till the sun entered the temple\nFrom a bad merger of substance inhaled his brain swelled\nIt filled with liquid in October, trouble and on a bus to AC\nWhen I saw his grave, I had the cubans so I doubled him\nAnd affirmed to teach myself to float my way more credit\nAnd discern between self-loathing and the love to keep them separate\nAnd blitz commander won because his offal needs a medic\nYou must expedite functions of truth and stick to it\nChoose

Emergency Medicine confirms it: Each year, between one and two dozen adult US males are admitted to ERs after having castrated themselves. With kitchen tools, usually, sometimes wire cutters. In answer to the obvious question, surviving patients most often report that their sexual urges had become a source of intolerable conflict and anxiety. The desire for perfect release and the real-world impossibility of perfect, whenever-you-want-it release had together produced a tension they could no longer stand.\n\nIt is to the 30+ testosteronically afflicted males whose cases have been documented in the past two years that your correspondents wish to dedicate this article. And to those tormented souls considering autocastration in 1998, we wish to say: \u201cStop! Stay your hand! Hold off with those kitchen utensils and/or wire cutters!\u201d Because we believe we may have found an alternative.\n\nEvery spring, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents awards for outstanding achievement in all aspects of mainstream cinema. These are the Academy Awards. Mainstream cinema is a major industry in the United States, and so are the Academy Awards. The AAs\u2019 notorious commercialism and hypocrisy disgust many of the millions and millions and millions of viewers who tune in during prime time to watch the presentations. It is not a coincidence that the Oscars ceremony is held during TV\u2019s Sweeps Week. We pretty much all tune in, despite the grotesquerie of watching an industry congratulate itself on its pretense that it\u2019s still an art form, of hearing people in $5,000 gowns invoke lush clich\u00e9s of surprise and humility scripted by publicists, etc.\u2014the whole cynical postmodern deal\u2014but we all still seem to watch. To care. Even though the hypocrisy hurts, even though opening grosses and marketing strategies are now bigger news than the movies themselves, even though Cannes and Sundance have become nothing more than enterprise zones. But the truth is that there\u2019s no more real joy about it all anymore. Worse, there seems to be this enormous unspoken conspiracy where we all pretend that there\u2019s still joy. That we think it\u2019s funny when Bob Dole does a Visa ad and Gorbachev shills for Pizza Hut. That the whole mainstream celebrity culture is rushing to cash in and all the while congratulating itself on pretending not to cash in. Underneath it all, though, we know the whole thing sucks.\n\nYour correspondents humbly offer an alternative.\n\nEvery January, the least pretentious city in America hosts the Annual AVN Awards. The AVN stands for Adult Video News, which is sort of the Variety of the US porn industry. This thick, beautifully designed magazine costs $7.95 per issue, is about 80 percent ads, and is clearly targeted at adult-video retailers. Its circulation is appr. 40,000.\n\nThough the sub-line vagaries of entertainment accounting are legendary, it is universally acknowledged that the US adult-film industry, at $3.5-4 billion in annual sales, rentals, cable charges, and video-masturbation-booth revenues, is an even larger and more efficient moneymaking machine than legitimate mainstream American cinema (the latter\u2019s annual gross commonly estimated at $2-2.5 billion). The US adult industry is centered in LA\u2019s San Fernando Valley, just over the mountains from Hollywood.1 Some insiders like to refer to the adult industry as Hollywood\u2019s Evil Twin, others as the mainstream\u2019s Big Red Son.\nIt is no accident that Adult Video News\u2014a slick, expensive periodical whose articles are really more like infomercials\u2014and its yearly Awards both came into being in 1982. The early \u201980s, after all, saw the genesis of VCRs and home-video rentals, which have done for the adult industry pretty much what TV did for pro football.\n\nFrom the 12/11/97 press release issued by AVN (visitable also at www.avn.com):\n\n- The nominations for the 15th Annual AVN Awards were announced today.2 This year\u2019s awards show, commemorating AVN\u2019s 15th anniversary, celebrates \u201cHistory\u201d. [sic]\n\n- Awards will be presented in a record 106 categories over a two night period.\n\n- The adult industry released nearly 8,000 adult releases [sic] in 1997, including over 4,000 \u201cnew\u201d releases (non-compilation). AVN reviewed every new release in every categroy [sic] this past year, logging over 30,000 sex scenes.3\n\n- By comparison, last year there were approximately 375 films eligible for the Academy Awards that these voters [sic\u2014meaning different voters from the AVN voters, presumably] were required to see. AVN had to watch more than 10 times the amount of releases in order to develop these nominations [usage and repetition sic, though 4,000 divided by 375 is indeed over 10].\n\nFrom the acceptance speech of Mr. Tom Byron, Saturday, 10 January 1998, Caesars Forum ballroom, Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino complex, Las Vegas NV, upon winning AVN\u2019s 1998 Male Performer of the Year Award (and with no little feeling): \u201cI want to thank every beautiful woman I ever put my cock inside.\u201d [Laughter, cheers, ovation.]\nFrom the acceptance speech of Ms. Jeanna Fine, ibid., upon winning AVN\u2019s 1998 Best Supporting Actress Award for her role in Rob Black\u2019s Miscreants: \u201cJesus, which one is this for, Miscreants? Jesus, that\u2019s another one where I read the script and said \u2018Oh shit, I am going to go to hell. [Laughter, cheers.] But that\u2019s okay, \u2019cause all my friends\u2019ll be there too!\u201d [Huge wave of laughter, cheers, applause.]\n\nFrom the inter-Award banter of Mr. Bobby Slayton, professional comedian and master of ceremonies for the 1997 AVNAs: \u201cI know I\u2019m looking good, though, like younger, \u2019cause I started using this special Grecian Formula\u2014every time I find a gray hair, I fuck my wife in the ass. [No laughter, scattered groans.] Fuck you. That\u2019s a great joke. Fuck you.\u201d\n\nBobby Slayton, a gravelly-voiced Dice Clay knockoff who kept introducing every female performer as \u201cthe woman I\u2019m going to cut my dick off for,\u201d and who astounded all the marginal print journalists in attendance with both his unfunniness and his resemblance to every apartment-complex coke dealer we\u2019d ever met, is mercifully absent from the 1998 Awards gala. The \u201998 emcee is one Robert Schimmel, alumnus of In Living Color and a Howard Stern regular. Schimmel looks like a depraved, deeply tan Wallace Shawn and is no less coarse than B. Slayton but a lot better. He does a pantomime of someone attempting intercourse with a Love Doll he\u2019s been too lazy to blow up all the way. He contrasts the woeful paucity of his own ejaculate with the concussive orgasms of certain well-known male performers,4 comparing these men\u2019s ejaculations to automatic lawn sprinklers and doing an eerie sonic impression of same. All of 1998\u2019s marginal print journalists are together at Table 189 at the very back of the ballroom. Most of these reporters are from the sorts of men\u2019s magazines that sit shrinkwrapped behind the cash registers of convenience stores, and they are a worldly and jaded crew indeed, but Schimmel gets a couple of them\u2014whose noms de guerre are Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth\u2014laughing so uproariously that people at the Anabolic Video table nearby keep looking over in annoyance. At one point during a routine on premature ejaculation, Dick Filth actually chokes on a California roll.\n\n\u2026 But all this is Saturday night, the main event. And there are a whole lot of festivities preceding Saturday\u2019s climax.\n\nThe adult industry is vulgar. Would anyone disagree? One of the AVN Awards\u2019 categories is \u201cBest Anal Themed Feature\u201d; another is \u201cBest Overall Marketing Campaign\u2014Company Image.\u201d Irresistible, a 1983 winner in several categories, has been spelled Irresistable in Adult Video News for fifteen straight years. The industry\u2019s not only vulgar, it\u2019s predictably vulgar. All the clich\u00e9s are true. The typical porn producer really is the ugly little man with a bad toupee and a pinkie-ring the size of a Rolaids. The typical porn director really is the guy who uses the word class as a noun to mean refinement. The typical porn starlet really is the lady in Lycra eveningwear with tattoos all down her arms who\u2019s both smoking and chewing gum while telling journalists how grateful she is to Wadcutter Productions Ltd. for footing her breast-enlargement bill. And meaning it. The whole AVN Awards weekend comprises what Mr. Dick Filth calls an Irony-Free Zone.\nBut of course we should keep in mind that vulgar has many dictionary definitions and that only a couple of these have to do w/ lewdness or bad taste. At root, vulgar just means popular on a mass scale. It is the semantic opposite of pretentious or snobby. It is humility with a comb-over. It is Nielsen ratings and Barnum\u2019s axiom and the real bottom line. It is big, big business.\nThirty-four-year-old porn actor Cal Jammer killed himself in 1995. Starlets Shauna Grant, Nancy Kelly, Alex Jordan, and Savannah have all killed themselves in the last decade. Savannah and Jordan received AVN\u2019s Best New Starlet awards in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Savannah killed herself after getting mildly disfigured in a car accident. Alex Jordan is famous for having addressed her suicide note to her pet bird. Crewman and performer Israel Gonzalez killed himself at a porn company warehouse in 1997.\n\nAn LA-based support group called PAW (=Protecting Adult Welfare) runs a 24-hour crisis line for people in the adult industry. A fundraiser for PAW was held at a Mission Hills CA bowling alley last November. It was a nude bowling tournament. Dozens of starlets agreed to take part. Two or three hundred adult-video fans showed up and paid to watch them bowl naked. No production companies or their executives participated or gave money. The fundraiser took in $6,000, which is slightly less than two one-millionths of porn\u2019s yearly gross.\n\nAs you know if you\u2019ve seen Casino, Showgirls, Bugsy, etc., there are really three Las Vegases. Binion\u2019s, where the World Series of Poker is always played, exemplifies the \u201cOld Vegas,\u201d centered around Fremont Street. Las Vegas\u2019s future is even now under late-stage construction at the very end of the Strip, on the outskirts of town (where US malls always go up); it\u2019s to be a bunch of theme-parkish, more \u201cfamily-oriented\u201d venues of the kind that De Niro describes so plangently at the end of Casino.\n\nBut Las Vegas as most of us see it, Vegas qua Vegas, comprises the dozen or so hotels that flank the Strip\u2019s middle. Vegas Populi: the opulent, intricate, garish, ecstatically decadent hotels, cathedra to gambling, partying, and live entertainment of the most microphone- swinging sort. The Sands. The Sahara. The Stardust. MGM Grand, Maxim. All within a small radius. Yearly utility expenditures on neon well into seven figures. Harrah\u2019s, Casino Royale (with its big 24-hour Denny\u2019s attached), Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace. The Mirage, with its huge laddered waterfall always lit up. Circus Circus. Treasure Island, with its intricate facade of decks and rigging and mizzens and vang. The Luxor, shaped like a ziggurat from Babylon of yore. Barbary Coast, whose sign out front says CASH YOUR PAYCHECK\u2014WIN UP TO $25,000. These hotels are the Vegas we know. The land of Lola and Wayne. Of Siegfried and Roy, Copperfield. Showgirls in towering headdress. Sinatra\u2019s sandbox. Most of them built in the \u201950s and \u201960s, the era of mob chic and entertainment-cum-industry. Half-hour lines for taxis. Smoking not just allowed but encouraged. Toupees and convention nametags and women in furs of all hue. A museum that features the World\u2019s Biggest Coke Bottle. The Harley-Davidson Cafe, with its tympanum of huge protruding hawg; Bally\u2019s H&C, with its row of phallic pillars all electrified and blinking in grand mal sync. A city that pretends to be nothing but what it is, an enormous machine of exchange\u2014of spectacle for money, of sensation for money, of money for more money, of pleasure for whatever be tomorrow\u2019s abstract cost.\n\nNor let us forget Vegas\u2019s synecdoche and beating heart. It\u2019s kittycorner from Bally\u2019s: Caesars Palace. The granddaddy. As big as 20 Wal-Marts end to end. Real marble and fake marble, carpeting you can pass out on without contusion, 130,000 square feet of casino alone. Domed ceilings, clerestories, barrel vaults. In Caesars Palace is America conceived as a new kind of Rome: conqueror of its own people. An empire of Self. It\u2019s breathtaking. The winter\u2019s light rain makes all the neon bleed. The whole thing is almost too pretty to stand. There could be no site but Las Vegas\u2019s Caesars for modern porn\u2019s Awards show\u2014here, the AAVNAs are one more spectacle. Way more tourists and conventioneers recognize the starlets than you\u2019d expect. Double-takes all over the hotel. Even just standing around or putting coins in a slot machine, the performers become a prime attraction. Las Vegas doesn\u2019t miss a trick.\n\nThe Annual AVN Awards are always scheduled to coincide with the International Consumer Electronics Show (a.k.a. CES), which this year runs from 8 through 11 January. The CES is a very big deal. It\u2019s like a combination convention and talent show for the best and brightest in the world of consumer tech. Steve Forbes is here, and DSS\u2019s Thomson. Sun Microsystems is using this year\u2019s CES to launch its PersonalJava 1.0. Bill Gates gives a packed-house speech on Saturday morning. Major players from TV, cable, and merchandising host a panel on the short-term viability of HDTV. A forum on the problem of product returns by disgruntled customers seats 1,500 and is SRO. The CES as a whole is bigger than your correspondents\u2019 hometowns. It\u2019s spread out over four different hotels and has 10,000+ booths with everything from \u201cThe First Ever Full Text Message Pager in a Wristwatch\u201d to the world\u2019s premier self-heating home satellite dish (\u201cThe Snow and Ice Solution!\u201d).\n\nBut far and away the CES\u2019s most popular venue, with total attendance well over 100,000 every year, is what is called the Adult Software5 exhibition, despite the fact that the CES itself treats the Adult tradeshow kind of like the crazy relative in the family and keeps it way out in what used to be the parking garage of the Sands hotel. This facility, a serious bus ride from all the other CES sites, is an enormous windowless all-cement space that during show hours manages to induce both agoraphobia and claustrophobia. A big sign says you have to be 21 to get in. The median age inside is 45, almost all males, nearly everyone wearing some sort of conventioneer\u2019s nametag. Every production company in the adult industry, from Anabolic to Zane, has a booth here. The really big companies have booths that are sprawling and multidisplay and more like small strip malls. A lot of porn\u2019s top female performers are contract players, exclusive vendors to one particular production company; and one reason why a lot of the starlets seem kind of tired and cranky by Saturday night\u2019s Awards gala is that they will have spent much of the previous 72 hours at their companies\u2019 CES booths, on their feet all day in vertiginous heels, signing autographs and posing for pictures and pressing all manner of flesh.\n\nThe best way to describe the sonic environment at the \u201998 CES is: Imagine that the apocalypse took the form of a cocktail party. Male fans move through the fractal maze of booths in groups of three or more. Their expressions tend to be those of junior-high boys at a peephole, an expression that looks pretty surreal on a face with jowls and no hairline. Some among them are video retailers; most are not. Most are just hard-core fans, the industry\u2019s breath and bread. A lot of them not only recognize but seem to know the names, stage names, and curricula vitae of almost all the female performers.\n\nIt takes an average of two hours and twelve minutes to traverse the Adult CES expo, counting an average of four delays for getting lost after a chicane turn or some baroque ceiling-high cheval glass designed to double the visual exposure of Heatwave Video\u2019s display for Texas Dildo Masquerade gets you all turned around. Your correspondents are accompanied by Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, who have very generously offered to act as guides and docents, and here is a random spatter of the things we see the first time we come in:\n\nA second-tier Arrow Video starlet in a G-string poses for a photo, forked dorsally over the knee of a morbidly obese cellphone retailer from suburban Philadelphia. The guy taking the picture, whose CES nametag says Hi and that his name is Sherm, addresses the starlet as \u201cbabe\u201d and asks her to readjust so as to \u201cgive us a little more bush down there.\u201d An Elegant Angel starlet with polyresin wings attached to her back is eating a Milky Way bar while she signs video boxes. Actor Steven St. Croix is standing near the Caballero Home Video booth, saying to no one in particular \u201cLet me out of here, I can\u2019t wait to get out of here.\u201d6 Adult-video stores all have a distinctive smell\u2014a mix of cheap magnetic tape and disinfectant\u2014and the Sands\u2019 former parking garage is rank with it. Asian businessmen move through the aisles in dense graceful packs and are assiduously cheery and polite. A young guy in a full-color Frankenstein T-shirt is spraypainting cartoon flames on an actress\u2019s breasts at the Sin City booth. The actress\u2014an obscure one, not even Filth and Hecuba know her name\u2014has normal-size breasts, and there\u2019s not much of an audience. Producer/director Max Hardcore draws a way bigger crowd at the MAXWORLD booth, where one of his girls is squatting on the countertop masturbating with the butt of a riding crop. Max\u2019s videos\u2019 promotional posters have him carrying a girl in minishorts over his shoulder against the backdrop of various city skylines; the pitches at the bottom say \u201cSEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL! SEE CUM-SPLATTERED GIRLS TOO STUPID TO KNOW BETTER!\u201d Max is a story all to himself, according to Harold Hecuba. D. Filth and a porn executive dressed entirely in Campbell Nightwatch plaid are smoking cigars and keep holding their cigars up together and comparing the ash to see which one has the cleanest burn. A lot of the industry males and even some of the starlets are also smoking cigars. 1998 is definitely the Year of the Cigar. The starlets are all in either extremely formal cocktail dresses or else abbreviated latex/vinyl/ Lycra ensembles. Heels are uniformly sharp and ultrahigh. Some of the starlets are so heavily made up they look embalmed. They tend to have complexly coiffed hair that looks really good from 20 feet away but on closer inspection is dry and dead. Someone who is either sometime-performer Jeff Marton or \u201cBizarro-Sleaze\u201d filmmaker Gregory Dark is doing sleight-of-hand tricks with his trademark fedora.7 Whoever he is, he has a goatee. Harold Hecuba also has a goatee; Dick Filth has more like a soul patch. H.H. and D.F., longtime industry journalists, know everybody here and keep getting stopped and drawn into conversations. (These delays, during which yr. corresps. sort of stand there awkwardly at the edge of the conversation and try to look around as if they too know people here and are waiting only to spot them in the crowd before they go off and get into their own involved conversations, have not been included in the 132-minute Adult CES-traversal average.) This year, a good 75 percent of the males in and around the porn industry appear to be sporting variants of the goatee.8\n\nNext to the Outlaw Video booth, a starlet in a gold lam\u00e9 spaghetti-strap gown, chewing gum and blowing large blue bubbles, is being videotaped by a disabled fan whose camera and parabolic mike are bolted to the arm of his wheelchair; the starlet is pointing to the tattoos on her left arm and appears to be explaining the origin and context of each one. At the Vivid Video multibooth complex,9 Ms. Taylor Hayes has what is probably the longest autograph-and-flesh-press line in the entire Sands garage. Taylor is major-league pretty\u2014she looks like a slightly debauched Cindy Crawford\u2014and an oversize monitor suspended from the ceiling over the Vivid area plays clips of her scantily clad and dancing amid dry-ice fumes. There\u2019s a berm of boxed videos on the floor by the counter and a huge man with a visor and handheld credit card machine on Taylor\u2019s right flank as she greets each fan like a long-lost relative. According to Dick Filth, Taylor is both a genuinely nice person and a consummate pro.\n\nThe booth for XPlor Media\u2014a company known for its \u201cSouthern Belles\u201d video series and ORGY FOR WORLD PEACE Website\u2014is arresting because all the execs at XPlor seem to be under 25 and the booth\u2019s atmosphere is that of a fraternity party in its third straight day. One young bald guy is unconscious in a fetal position on the counter, and some wag has glued all sorts of feathers and flaccid plastic two-headed dildoish things to his skull. XPlor\u2019s owner-auteurs are two brothers, trust-fund babies from a Connecticut suburb of NYC. Their names are Farrel and Moffitt Timlake. Farrel, who wears twelve-hole Doc Martens and cargo pants and what\u2019s either a very light parka or very heavy sweatshirt with a hood that stays up at all times, is a particular cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre at the \u201998 CES because he\u2019s apparently a friend of the two guys who do South Park, and these guys are rumored to be in Vegas and to possess tickets to Saturday\u2019s Awards banquet.10\n\nEveryone without exception is sweating. At all but a few of the booths, contract starlets treat the fans with the same absent, rigid-faced courtesy that flight attendants and restaurant hostesses tend to use. You can tell how bored the performers are by the way their faces light up when they see someone they know. Well over half of the industry\u2019s current superstars are in this huge room.11 The infamous T.T. Boy is here, standing alone with his trademark glower, the Boy who is rumored to bring a semiautomatic pistol with him to the set and who was featured in a 1995 New Yorker article that was full of lines like \u201cA porn shoot is an intricately delineated ecology.\u201d Mr. Vince Vouyer (sic) is on hand, as are Seth Gecko, Jake Steed, Serenity, Missy, and Nick East. Here is the ageless Randy West, who looks just the way a surfer would look if that surfer were also a Mob enforcer, with his perennial tan and hair like frozen surf. Mr. Jon Dough\u2014winner of AVN\u2019s coveted Best Actor/Video statuette in both \u201996 and \u201997\u2014alternates between various booths, wearing his customary expression of having psychologically evolved to the point where he\u2019s so incredibly cool and detached that life is one long yawn. Here also is Mark Davis, far and away the most handsome of the current males, a near-double for Gregory Harrison of the old Trapper John series except for Davis\u2019s ultrashort psych-patient haircut (plus goatee).\nAnd 20-year veteran Joey Silvera is at this year\u2019s CES, though mostly in his capacity as an auteur: Silvera now directs Evil Angel\u2019s popular \u201cButt Row\u201d video series.12 Following the lead of pioneers like John Leslie and Paul Thomas, most of today\u2019s top male stars now also direct (and, per the store boxes, \u201cPresent\u201d) their own line of videos, e.g. \u201cTom Byron\u2019s Cumback Pussy\u201d series, \u201cJon Dough\u2019s Dirty Stories,\u201d the eye-popping Rocco Siffredi\u2019s \u201c[Various European Cities] By Night\u201d line, etc. The So-and-So Presents series seems to be an industry trend, like cigars and goatees.\n\nIt is difficult to describe how it feels to gaze at living human beings whom you\u2019ve seen perform in hard-core porn. To shake the hand of a man whose precise erectile size, angle, and vasculature are known to you. That strange I-think-we\u2019ve-met-before sensation one feels upon seeing any celebrity in the flesh is here both intensified and twisted. It feels intensely twisted to see reigning industry queen Jenna Jameson chilling out at the Vivid booth in Jordaches and a latex bustier and to know already that she has a tattoo of a sundered valentine with the tagline HEART BREAKER on her right buttock and a tiny hairless mole just left of her anus. To watch Peter North try to get a cigar lit and to have that sight backlit by memories of his artilleryesque ejaculations.13 To have seen these strangers\u2019 faces in orgasm\u2014that most unguarded and purely neural of expressions, the one so vulnerable that for centuries you basically had to marry a person to get to see it.14 This weirdness may account for some of the complex emotional intercourse taking place between the performers and fans at the Adult CES. The patrons may leer and elbow one another at a distance, but by the time the men get to the front of the line and face the living incarnation of their VCR\u2019s fantasy-babe, most of them turn into quivering goggle-eyed schoolboys, sheepish and salivaless and damp. The same thing evidently happens at the hundreds of strip clubs all over the country where porn starlets appear as Featured Dancers (for five figures a week, according to Filth) and do photos and autographs after the show:\n\n\u201cMost of these guys become incredibly nervous when I come up to them,\u201d veteran starlet Shane has explained. \u201cI\u2019ll put my arms around a guy and his whole body will be trembling. They pretty much do whatever I tell them to do.\u201d The whole industry, now, has this oddly reversed equation\u2014the consumers are the ones who seem ashamed or shy, while the performers are cocky and smooth and 100 percent pro.\nIt is no longer the 1980s, and the Meese Commission mentality that led to a major crackdown on video porn is long gone. Federal task forces and PTA outrage are now focused on the Internet and kiddie porn. But today\u2019s adult industry is still hypersensitive about what it perceives as fascist attacks on its First Amendment freedoms. A specially prepared trailer now runs before many higher-end adult videos, right between the legal disclaimer on the product\u2019s compliance with or exemption from 18 U.S.C \u00a72257 and ads for phone services like 900-666-FUCK. Against shots of flowing flags and the Lincoln Memorial, a voiceover says stuff like:\n\nCensorship goes against our Bill of Rights and the founding principles of this country. It is an attempt on the part of the government to legislate morality and to stifle free expression.15 This new, \u201clegal\u201d morality is dangerous to all Americans. Vote for those who believe in limiting government intrusion into your personal affairs. Vote against government control of your life and home. Vote against censorship. Only you, the People, can keep the American ideal intact.\n\nThese trailers always say they\u2019re sponsored by either the Adult Video Association or something called the Free Speech Coalition. Both organizations (and the extent to which the two are separate is unclear) are basically industry PACs. Porn, in other words, has taken the political lessons of the \u201980s to heart; it is now a hard-lobbying political force no less than GM or RJR Nabisco.\n\nFeminists of all different stripe oppose the adult industry for reasons having to do with pornography\u2019s putative effects on women. Their arguments are well-known and in some respects persuasive. But certain antiporn arguments in the 1990s are now centered on adult entertainment\u2019s alleged effects on the men who consume it. Some \u201cmasculists\u201d believe that a lot of men get addicted to video porn in a way that causes grievous psychic harm. Example: An essayist named David Mura has a little book called A Male Grief: Notes on Pornography and Addiction, which is a bit New Agey but interesting in places, e.g.:\n\nAt the essence of pornography is the image of flesh used as a drug, a way of numbing psychic pain. But this drug lasts only as long as the man stares at the image\u2026 . In pornographic perception, each gesture, each word, each image, is read first and foremost through sexuality. Love or tenderness, pity or compassion, become subsumed by, and are made subservient to, a \u201cgreater\u201d deity, a more powerful force\u2026 . The addict to pornography desires to be blinded, to live in a dream. Those in the thrall of pornography try to eliminate from their consciousness the world outside pornography, and this includes everything from their family and friends or last Sunday\u2019s sermon to the political situation in the Middle East. In engaging in such elimination the viewer reduces himself. He becomes stupid.\n\nThis kind of stuff might sound a little out-there, maybe, until one observes the eerie similarity between the eyes of males in strip clubs or stroke parlors and the eyes of people in their fifth hour of pumping silver dollars into the slot machines of the Sands\u2019 casino, or maybe until one\u2019s seen firsthand the odd kind of shock on the faces of CES patrons seeing performers now \u201cin the flesh,\u201d complete with chewing gum and chin-pimples and all the human stuff you never see\u2014never want to see\u2014in films.\n\nMaybe just a little bit more here on the whole scene at the Adult CES, which is a lot more of a rub-elbows-type venue than the stylized Awards ceremony is going to end up being\u2026 . Mr. Harold Hecuba is deep in conversation with a marginal porn producer about one of his performers\u2019 being sidelined with something called a \u201cprolapsed sphincter,\u201d which condition yr. corresps. decline to follow up on in any way. We are standing just west of a staff writer for Digital Horizons who\u2019s dropped by to scope out the legendary scene in here again this year and is telling two presumed other tech writers that being around porn people always makes him feel like he\u2019s been somehow astrally projected onto a cocktail napkin. It is also roughly now that Ms. Jasmin St. Claire is making an appearance at the Impressive Media booth in order to spell the starlet behind the counter, who is limping to the booth\u2019s rear area; she (i.e., the limping starlet) has (reportedly) had to be sprayed with silicon to fit into her pants. The crowd at the Impressive Media venue immediately starts to enlarge. Jasmin St. Claire is wearing a red vinyl jacket-and-miniskirt ensemble. A porn starlet entering any kind of room or area has a distinctive energy about her\u2014you turn your head to look even if you don\u2019t seem to want to. It\u2019s like watching a figure from a pinball machine illustration or high-concept comic book step out into 3-D and head your way. It turns out really to be possible to feel as though your eyeballs are protruding slightly from their sockets. What makes the whole thing so weird is that Jasmin St. Claire isn\u2019t even all that pretty, at least not today. Her hair is dyed black in that cheap unreal Goth way, and she is so incredibly heavily made up that she looks like a crow. (She is also somewhat knock-kneed, plus of course has the requisite Howitzer-grade bust.) Ms. St. Claire is being escorted to the Impressive booth by two large men whose expressions are describable only as mug-shottish. This is another thing about porn starlets\u2014they\u2019re never alone. They\u2019re always accompanied by at least one and sometimes as many as four flinty-eyed males. The impression is that of a very expensive thoroughbred being led onto the track under a silk blanket.\n\nFYI, Ms. Jasmin St. Claire\u2019s cult-celebrity status at the \u201998 CES stems from her having broken the \u201cWorld Gang Bang Record\u201d16 by taking on 300 men in a row in Amazing Pictures\u2019 1996 World\u2019s Biggest Gang Bang 2. Since most of these 300 men were amateur porn-fans who\u2019d had only to fill out an application and produce an HIV all-clear from the DPH, she now enjoys an almost legendary populist appeal\u2014\u201cthe People\u2019s Porn Star\u201d\u2014and an enormous serpentine line of fans with cameras and autographable memorabilia has formed at the Impressive booth, which line Ms. St. Claire appears for the moment to be ignoring, because she and H. Hecuba, having exchanged double-cheek kisses, are now deep into some kind of t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate above the sockless Docksiders of the unconscious bald kid, who\u2019s (the kid has) evidently been carried or trundled by pranksters unknown from the XPlor counter (right next door) to this one. Dick Filth\u2014after your correspondents have remarked on how it\u2019s kind of heartwarming that everyone in the porn industry all seem to be friends, even critics and performers\u2014dishes an involved anecdote about how Jasmin St. Claire apparently once actually tried to strangle Harold Hecuba at an industry soir\u00e9e a couple years ago, an anecdote which, if you\u2019re interested, appears as FN17 just below. Twenty feet away, over at XPlor, Mr. Farrel Timlake has meanwhile produced what is alleged to be the prototype and world\u2019s only authorized Kenny\u00ae Action Figure from the upcoming South Park merchandising line\u2014fourteen inches tall, kind of heavy for a doll, w/ hood up and face obscured (not unlike F. Timlake\u2019s own hood and face)\u2014and is entertaining some of the IM crowd\u2019s spillover by manipulating the doll\u2019s limbs to simulate its \u201ctok[ing] a bone.\u201d\n\nNot unlike urban gangs, police, carnival workers, and certain other culturally marginalized guilds, the US porn industry is occluded and insular in a way that makes it seem like high school. There are cliques, anticliques, alliances, betrayals, conflagratory rumors, legendary enmities, and public bloodlettings, plus involved hierarchies of popularity and influence. You\u2019re either In or you\u2019re not. Performers, being the industry\u2019s fissile core, are of course In. Despite their financial power, studio execs and producers are not very In, and directors (especially those who\u2019ve never undergone the initiation of having on-camera sex themselves) are less In than the performers. Film reviewers and industry journalists are even less In than execs; and nonindustry journalists are way, way non-In, almost as low-caste as the great mass of porn fans themselves (for which fans the Insider term is: mook18 ).\n\nThe foregoing is meant to help explain how exactly your correspondents ended up in porn titan Max Hardcore\u2019s personal suite at the Sahara and got to hang out in the suite\u2019s living room with Max, certain of his crew, porn starlets Alex Dane and Caressa Savage, and two B-girls\u2014which is to say that it was actually Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth who were invited to hang out in the suite on Friday afternoon, but yr. corresps. clung almost like papooses to their backs, and the burly MAXWORLD Production Assistant wasn\u2019t quick enough about slamming the door.\nSo yr. corresps. were, for a couple hours, at least logistically speaking, In.\n\nFor a regular civilian male, hanging out in a hotel suite with porn starlets is a tense and emotionally convolved affair. There is, first, the matter of having seen the various intimate activities and anatomical parts of these starlets in videos heretofore and thus (weirdly) feeling shy about meeting them. But there is also a complex erotic tension. Because porn films\u2019 worlds are so sexualized, with everybody seemingly teetering right on the edge of coitus all the time and it taking only the slightest nudge or excuse\u2014a stalled elevator, an unlocked door, a cocked eyebrow, a firm handshake\u2014to send everyone tumbling into a tangled mass of limbs and orifices, there\u2019s a bizarre unconscious expectation/dread/ hope that this is what might happen in Max Hardcore\u2019s hotel room. Yr. corresps. here find it impossible to overemphasize the fact that this is a delusion. In fact, of course, the unconscious expectation/dread/hope makes no more sense than it would make to be hanging out with doctors at a medical convention and to expect that at the slightest provocation everyone in the room would tumble into a frenzy of MRIs and epidurals. Nevertheless the tension persists, despite the fact that the actresses are obviously tired and disassociated from the day\u2019s CES,19 plus, it emerges, somewhat sore\u2014it turns out that Max Hardcore is shooting one of his \u201cGonzo\u201d porn spectaculars right here at the 1998 Consumer Electronics Show, using the CES as a hook and backdrop, and the girls have been alternating CES booth-duty and riding-crop shenanigans with a tight and SS-intensive filming schedule. (Max, being a firm believer in the fait accompli method of filmmaking, has not yet gotten around to chatting with the CES\u2019s administration about his featuring the world\u2019s biggest consumer-tech tradeshow by name in a \u201cSEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL\u201d video.)\n\nMr. Max Hardcore\u2014a.k.a. Max Steiner, a.k.a. Paul Steiner, n\u00e9 Paul Little\u2014is 5'6\" and a very fit 135. He is somewhere between 40 and 60 years old and resembles more than anything a mesomorphic and borderline-psycho Henry Gibson. He is wearing a black cowboy hat and what has to be one of the very few long-sleeved Hawaiian shirts in existence anywhere. Once the PA guarding the door mellows out and introductions are made (H.H. managing to drop the name of this magazine several times in one sentence), Max reveals himself to be a genial and garrulous host and offers everybody disposable plastic cups of vodka before settling in with yr. corresps. to discuss what for Max are the most pressing and relevant issues at this year\u2019s AVN Awards, which issues are the career, reputation, personal history, and overall life philosophy of Mr. Max Hardcore.\n\nPioneered (depending whom you talk to) by either Max Hardcore or John (\u201cButtman\u201d) Stagliano, \u201cGonzo\u201d has become one of this decade\u2019s most popular and profitable genres of adult video. It\u2019s more or less a cross between an MTV documentary and the Hell panel from Bosch\u2019s Garden of Earthly Delights. A Gonzo film is always set at some distinctive locale or occasion\u2014Daytona Beach at spring break, the Cannes Film Festival, etc. There\u2019s always a randy and salivous \u201chost\u201d talking directly to a handheld camera: \u201cWell and we\u2019re here at the Cannes Film Festival, and it looks like there\u2019s going to be lots of excitement, John Travolta and Sigourney Weaver are supposed to both be in town, and there\u2019s also the world-famous beach, and I\u2019m told there\u2019s always some real seriously good-looking little girls at the beach, so let\u2019s us head on down.\u201d (That\u2019s the approximate lead-in to a recent Max-at-Cannes Gonzo, a type of signature lead-in that Max refers to with a 56-tooth grin as \u201calways mercifully brief\u201d\u2014and please note the \u201clittle girls at the beach\u201d thing, because this is another of Max\u2019s professional signatures, the infantilization of his videos\u2019 females as dramatic foils for his own film persona, which is always that of a sort of degenerate uncle or stepdad.) Then the shaky but ever-focused camera heads on down to the ocean or mall or CES or whatever, scoping out attractive women20 while the host moans and chews his knuckle in lust. Then pretty soon host and camera start actually coming up to the women they\u2019ve been looking at and engaging them in little cameo \u201cinterviews\u201d full of sideways leers and salacious entendres. Some of the interviewees are actual civilians, but some are always what Max refers to as \u201cringers,\u201d meaning professional porn actresses. And so the viewer is treated to the classic frathouse fantasy of moving, via just a couple of singles-bar \u201cHey there babe\u201d lines, from scoping out an attractive woman to having wild and anatomically diverse sex with her, all while one of his buddies captures the whole thing on tape.21\n\nThe issue of who exactly invented Gonzo being impossibly vexed and so notwithstanding, it is true that Max Hardcore is famous as a director for several things: (1) Being incredibly disciplined about budgets and tactical logistics, right down to forcing his crew and staff to wear identical jumpsuits of scarlet nylon so that they look like a national ski team\u2014Max\u2019s shoots are described (by Max) as \u201calmost military operations\u201d; (2) Not only employing ringers but actually sometimes being able to talk real live civilian \u201clittle girls\u201d on the beach or in the mall into coming on back to the special MAXWORLD RV and having anal sex on camera;22 (3) Being the first in \u201cmainstream\u201d (meaning nonfetish) adult video to perpetrate on women levels of violation and degradation that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. W/r/t item (3), Max, after detailing for yr. correspondents the vo- and avocations that led him into the adult industry (a tale too literally incredible even to think about factchecking and trying to print), informs us that he is and always has been adult video\u2019s \u201ccutting-edge blade,\u201d and that other less bold and original filmmakers have systematically stolen and used his, Max\u2019s, degradations of women as a blueprint for their own subsequent shabby and derivative films\u2019 degradations.23 (Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, by the way, have heard Max hold forth many times before and are now outside the circle of discourse\u2014D.F. in the bathroom for what seems like a peculiarly long time, H.H. on the couch with the actresses hashing out the implications of Seinfeld\u2019s retirement for NBC\u2019s \u201998 lineup.)\n\nAlone and in a place of conspicuous honor on a wood-finish shelf above the suite\u2019s minibar is an actual AVN Awards statuette. The trophy resembles an Oscar/Emmy/Clio except that the figurine\u2019s arms are up and out (making it also look a bit like Richard Nixon at the climax of the \u201968 GOP convention), and something slightly blurry about the casting gives it a sort of cubic-zirconium aspect. Whether the statuette is heavy and solid vs. hollow and Little Leaguish remains unknown\u2014there is no invitation to touch or heft it. One of the B-girls on the couch is now either laughing or weeping into her hands at something Harold Hecuba has said; her bare shoulders heave. It would be totally fantastic if the Seinfeld rerun on the huge TV were the episode about everybody trying to refrain from masturbating, but it isn\u2019t.\n\nAsked by one of yr. corresps. what he won this AVN Award on the shelf for, Max Hardcore slaps his knee: \u201cI fucking stole it.\u201d It\u2019s now that hard middle-distance inspection reveals that the MAX HARDCORE on the metal strip at the trophy\u2019s base has been scratched in by someone who is not a professional engraver. It looks done with a screwdriver, in fact. Max expands on the statuette caper: Shut inexplicably out of the Awards for years, he last year, upon exiting the stage (he\u2019s always a presenter every year, which he regards as the AVNAs\u2019 way of twisting the emotional blade), espied in the wings a large cardboard box filled with blank and unused AVN Award statuettes.24 Whereupon he thought, as he now puts it, \u201cWhat the fuck, I fucking deserve it\u201d and snagged one, hiding it in his enormous Stetson and deriving no little satisfaction from attending various post-Awards parties with an illicit statuette under his hat. Max\u2019s crew all laugh very hard at this anecdote, though the actresses don\u2019t.\n\nAlex Dane is now telling Harold Hecuba about a stray dog she found and has decided to keep. She is excited as she describes the dog and for a moment seems about fourteen; the impression lasts only a second or two and is heartbreaking. One of the B-girls, meanwhile, is explaining that she has just gotten a pair of cutting-edge breast implants that she can actually adjust the size of by adding or draining fluid via small valves under her armpits, and then\u2014perhaps mistaking your correspondents\u2019 expressions for ones of disbelief\u2014she raises her arms to display the valves. There really are what appear to be valves.\n\nSo much about today\u2019s adult industry seems like an undeft parody of Hollywood and the nation writ large. The top performers are comic-book caricatures of sexual allure. The prosthetic breasts and lifted buttocks and (no kidding) artificial cheekbones are nothing more than accentuations of a mentality that yields huge liposuction and collagen industries. The gynecologically explicit sexuality of Jenna, Jasmin, et al. seems more than anything like a Mad magazine spoof of the \u201csmoldering\u201d sexuality of Sharon Stone and Madonna and so many other mainstream iconettes.25 Not to mention the fact that the adult industry takes many of the psychological deformities that Hollywood is famous for\u2014the vanity, the vulgarity, the rank commercialism\u2014and not only makes them overt and grotesque but seems then to revel in that grotesquerie.\n\nGood old Max Hardcore, for instance, is a total psychopath\u2014that\u2019s part of his on-screen Gonzo persona\u2014but so is the real Max/Paul Steiner. You\u2019d almost have to have been there in that suite. Max sits holding court in his hat and pointy boots, looking at once magisterial and mindless, while his red-suited acolytes laugh on cue and a jr. high dropout shows off her valves. In truth, the first ten minutes of the impromptu interview in the Sahara are spent passing around a copy of something called Icon magazine, which Max has told us is doing a profile on him\u2014we are expected to leaf through the magazine and comment favorably on its content and layout while Max watches us in the same hyperexpectant way that parents watch you when you\u2019re looking at a snapshot of their kid that they\u2019ve taken out uninvited and pressed on you. This is the actual chronology. There then follows a torrent of autobiography and background that yr. corresps. have decided to deny Max the satisfaction of seeing reproduced here. After which is a kind of Max 101-like survey of personal philosophy and Gonzo theory and the statuette anecdote. The vodka is top-shelf and the plastic cups dusty. Then one of the starlets decides that she\u2019s hungry, and Max insists on escorting her down to the Sahara\u2019s restaurant and wants everybody else to come along, which eventually results in the B-girls and crewmen and yr. corresps.26 all standing there awkwardly at the ma\u00eetre d\u2019s podium while Max personally conducts the starlet to her table and pulls out her chair and tucks a serviette into her cleavage and pulls out a platinum-plated money clip and announces in a voice audible to everyone in the restaurant and foyer that he \u201cwant[s] to take care of the little girl\u2019s damages in advance\u201d and shoves bills into the hanky-pocket of the ma\u00eetre d\u2019s tuxedo and then leaves her there by herself and herds us all back out and into the elevator and jabs impatiently at the button for his suite\u2019s floor, almost jumping up and down with fury at the elevator\u2019s delay; and we\u2019re all rushed back up to the suite because it\u2019s occurred to Max that he wants to show your corresps. something from this week\u2019s filming that he thinks will sum up his particular porn genius better than any amount of exposition could \u2026 and then, reseated, he starts flipping through a notebook to find something.\n\n\u201cWhat it is is we got this one little girl back in the [infamous MAXWORLD] trailer, and after some face-fucking27 and reaming her asshole and, like, your standard depravities, we get her to stick a pen\u2014no, a what-do-you-call \u2026\u201d\n\nCrewman: \u201cMagic Marker.\u201d\n\nMax: \u201c\u2026 Magic Marker, stick it up her asshole and write all this \u2026 this stuff,\u201d holding up the notebook, opened to a page; again he has us pass it around:\n\nis thereon written in a hand28 that seems impressively legible, considering. Dick Filth makes a waggish inquiry about future film plans involving this girl and a typewriter, but Max doesn\u2019t laugh (we noticed that Max never laughs at a joke he hasn\u2019t told), and so neither does anyone else.\n\nDoubtless most of this is going to get cut by Premiere, but it\u2019s worth also observing\u2014when this magazine\u2019s assigned photographer (who\u2019s also gotten in here with us this afternoon on H.H. and D.F.\u2019s coattails) begins wondering aloud about the possibility of getting some good portraits at the Awards of winners holding their statuettes\u2014the way Max right away jumps in with his idea of the perfect photo for the title page of this very article. The proposed shot is to be of Max Hardcore, holding several of the AVN Awards trophies he pledges either to win straight up or to gain possession of in other ways, seated in some kind of imperial-looking and really nice chair that is itself set up on the palm-studded boulevard of the famous Las Vegas Strip\u2014so the photographer\u2019ll get lots of smeary neon and appropriately phallic bldgs. in the background\u2014with a retinue of scantily clad starlets either draped swoonily over him or prostrate at his feet, or both. It is important to note that there are no audible scare-quotes, no irony or embarrassment or self-awareness of any sort on Max\u2019s face as he sketches this photo\u2019s tableau for us; he\u2019s in the kind of earnest that one imagines Irving Thalberg was always in.29 Your correspondents immediately begin to lobby hard for Max\u2019s idea, figuring that the photo would make a great illustration for the story of Max\u2019s proposing this very photo\u2014i.e., that it would point up the megalomania far more powerfully than mere reportage\u2014but the Premiere photographer, who is no actor, does such a poor job of disguising his repulsion at Max\u2019s self-regard that the atmosphere of the whole suite gets stilted and complexly hostile, and the rest of the interview is kind of a fizzle-yield, and overall Dick Filth said that we failed, in his phrase, to \u201cpenetrate to the core of the essence of what it is to be Max Hardcore.\u201d30\n\nThe 15th Annual AVN Awards are actually split over two consecutive nights, a tactic that Max H. thought the legit Oscars would do well to emulate: \u201cGet all the bullshit out of the way the first night\u2014best packaging, marketing, best gay, shit like that. Who wants to sit through that shit?\u201d\n\nHeld in a different, slightly smaller Caesars Palace ballroom, Friday\u2019s Awards show is indeed brisk. The ephemeral categories include Best Videography, Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Music. Each category\u2019s nominees are listed in the program, but only the winners are announced onstage, and they\u2019re announced four at a time, and applause is discouraged, and the master of ceremonies keeps telling the quartets of winners that \u201cIf you\u2019ll come on up quickly and help keep things moving it\u2019ll help us out a lot.\u201d Friday\u2019s only food is big wheels of vegetables and dip near the cash bar. The emcee is not headliner Robert Schimmel but a hypomanic guy named Dave Tyree, whose interpolated banter is 78 rpm and consists of stuff like \u201cIf God didn\u2019t want us to jerk off he would\u2019ve made our arms shorter.\u201d There are maybe 1,000 people in attendance, most only slightly dressed up, and there are no assigned tables, and everybody in the ballroom is moving around and chattering and treating the onstage proceedings the way people in a cocktail lounge treat the piano player.\n\nQ. $4,000,000,000 and 8,000 new releases a year\u2014why is adult video so popular in this country?\nA. Director and AVN-Hall-of-Fame inductee F. J. Lincoln: \u201cIt\u2019s always a little funny how it\u2019s called adult. What it really is, you get to be a kid again. You roll around and get dirty. It\u2019s the adult sandbox.\u201d\nA. Veteran woodman Joey Silvera: \u201cDudes, let\u2019s face it\u2014America wants to jerk off.\u201d\nA. Industry journalist Harold Hecuba: \u201cIt\u2019s the new Barnum. Nobody ever goes broke overestimating the rage and misogyny of the average American male.\u201d\nA. Porn starlet Jacklyn Lick: \u201cI think a lot of fans are very lonely people.\u201d\nQ. There don\u2019t seem to be a whole lot of condoms used in hard-core scenes.\nA. Harold Hecuba: \u201cNever have been. They\u2019re viewed as a turn-off. This business is about engineering fantasies.\u201d\nQ. But even just venerially\u2014all these anal shenanigans and everything. Is there much worry in the industry about HIV?\nA. Harold Hecuba: \u201cThere\u2019s not as much worry about AIDS now. Everybody gets tested on a schedule.\u201d\nQ. What about herpes?\nA. H.H.: \u201cI think it\u2019s rampant.\u201d\n\nLast year\u2019s Best-Sex-Scene-in-a-Film winner Vince Vouyer\u2019s real name turns out to be John LaForme. Rhetorical Q.: How, if one\u2019s real name was John LaForme, could that person possibly feel the need for a nom de guerre?\n\nMr. Tom Byron describes being able to tumesce and ejaculate more or less on demand as an exercise in \u201ccontrol, like meditation or surfing. It\u2019s like a gymnast staying on the balance beam. You practice enough, you can do anything.\u201d31\n\nFormer woodman and current auteur Paul Thomas was a member of the original Broadway cast of Jesus Christ Superstar.\n\nThe tall, crazed-looking, and ever-rampant Mike Horner, three-time Best Actor winner and a member of the AVN Hall of Fame,32 is actually a classically trained opera singer.\n\nDeceased starlet Nancy Kelly\u2019s real name was Kelly Van Dyke. She was the daughter of TV\u2019s Jerry Van Dyke and so, of course, the niece of Dick.\n\nExotic rookie actress Midori, one of the nominees in the \u201998 AVNAs\u2019 Best New Starlet category, is the sister of \u201980s pop star Jodi Whatley. Midori has stated publicly that she views upscale contemporary porn as a stepping-stone to a mainstream career, not unlike becoming Miss America or doing a couple seasons on SNL. Harold Hecuba characterizes Midori\u2019s career strategy as \u201cgrievously ill-advised.\u201d\n\nAdult Video News VP and Executive Editor Gene Ross, presenting the aforementioned 1998 AVN Award for Best Director/Video to Miscreants\u2019 Rob Black, will hail Mr. Black as \u201ca guy who can take buttholes, midgets, and fried fish, and make a love story.\u201d33\n\nFrom The New Yorker\u2019s 1995 article on the psychosexual plight of the adult industry\u2019s woodman: \u201cThe Cal Jammers who are part of this feminization feel they have stormed the walls of female ornament to reclaim male prerogative, only to find themselves lost in a garden of gender irony.\u201d\n\nMr. John \u201cButtman\u201d Stagliano\u2014CEO of Evil Angel Inc., a man described by US News & World Report as \u201cthe nation\u2019s leading director of hard-core videos\u201d\u2014not only has publicly announced testing positive for HIV but has identified the infection\u2019s vector as a transsexual prostitute in S\u00e3o Paulo with whom Stagliano had unprotected anal intercourse in 1995. He\u2019s anxious that people not get the wrong idea: \u201cI am not particularly interested in guys, but I am interested in dicks. Forbidden taboos lead to all sorts of neurotic behavior, which leads to me being fucked in the ass without a rubber.\u201d\n\nAre the AVN Awards possibly rigged? Max Hardcore (he of the purloined statuette, keep in mind) calls the Awards \u201ca total conflict of interests.\u201d After all, he explains, Adult Video News is heavily ad-dependent,34 and they\u2019re under \u201cpressure from the big hitters like Vivid and VCA to like, you know, give the nod.\u201d\n\nMs. Ellen Thompson, AVN Associate Editor and an Awards judge who votes under the n.d.g. Ida Slapter:35 \u201cWe\u2019ve heard this for years. I hear this complaining also goes on in the mainstream. I don\u2019t like insulting anybody, but sometimes there\u2019s sour grapes. What are we supposed to say? Vivid and VCA put out good product. We truly, honestly do vote fairly.\u201d\n\nMr. Dick Filth: \u201cThe best perception, backed up by tons of anecdotal evidence, is that they are totally, totally fixed and rigged.\u201d\nSaturday\u2019s the big night. The banquet, the onstage entertainment, the headline Awards. See & be seen. Gamblers and conventioneers and mooks of all ilk are massed at the Caesars cabstand to watch the starlets arrive. There are camcorders and flashbulbs but no paparazzi per se. Some of the performers come in limos, others in shiny penile sports cars; others seem to mysteriously just suddenly appear. There are even more starlets here than there were at the CES, and they are seriously dolled up. There are cerise halters and pear-colored Lycra bodysuits with open-toed pumps of burgundy suede. There are platinum lam\u00e9 gowns slit all the way to the tenth rib. Bottoms less covered than shellacked look like they by all rights should have panty- or at least thong lines but do not have such lines. There are lime-green vinyl leotards and toile bellbottoms and fishscale bustiers and miniskirts the same texture and length as a tutu\u2019s ruffle. Garter straps flash and Merry Widow bodices shade the interiors of translucent blouses. Several of the outfits defy very basic precepts of modern physics. Coiffures are towering and complex. The starlets are all on the arms of men, but none of these escorts are male porn performers. Average heel-height is 4\"+. A loud-voiced civilian in the cabstand crowd actually utters the phrase \u201cVa Va Voom,\u201d which yr. correspondents had never before heard anywhere outside a Sinatra movie. Breasts are uniformly zeppelinesque and in various perilous stages of semiconfinement. Max Hardcore is under a Stetson the color of weak chocolate milk, and his adjustable B-girl\u2014arrayed in a type of scarlet cowboy suit that\u2019s mostly fringe\u2014has inflated her breasts to what\u2019s got to be maximum capacity.\n\nWoodman-wise, black is clearly In at the 15th Annual AVNAs. A lot of the men are in black tuxedos and black ties and black dress shirts. One is wearing a paisley suit of either serge or some kind of upholstery material. Another has silver platform shoes and a silver vest w/ no shirt underneath. The XPlor boys are in Klein sweatshirts and urban-camouflage fatigues, and there\u2019s a large contingent with them that may or may not include the South Park brain trust. A guy on the arm of Ms. Morgan Fairlane has an immense and razorous violet mohawk \u00e0 la British punks of the late 1970s.\n\nInside the hotel, a kind of impromptu cocktail party forms in the broad marble hall outside Caesars Palace\u2019s largest and reportedly classiest ballroom, which is called Caesars Forum. Burly casino staffers stand taking tickets and being very discouraging about anybody trying to bum-rush the show. The crush of bodies out here entails a degree of physical contact that CES mooks never even dreamed of. There are pockets of klieg-glare as cable TV reporters interview various performers about (sic:) the air of keen excitement in the air. Mysterious bundles of co-ax emerge from under the Forum doors and go all the way up the length of the hallway and disappear around the corner. A suspicion that we\u2019d had all week but decided was unverifiable is now instantly verified when one of yr. corresps. gets accidentally shoved against a starlet and is jabbed in the side by her breasts and it hurts. A lot of people are holding drinks in plastic glasses and it\u2019s unknown where they got them. The starlets take turns getting interviewed re atmospheric excitement while the woodmen all avoid the cameras like mafiosi. The TV lights are not doing anyone\u2019s skin tone any good at all. In their all-black tuxes, several of the male Insiders\u2014including e.g. John Leslie and Tony Tedeschi\u2014are so pallid and sallow as to appear diseased. Mr. Nick East devotes a full 5.5 minutes of rapt concentration to the cuticle of his left thumb. A slight surprise is that a lot of the industry\u2019s elite woodmen are short\u20145'6\", 5'7\"36 \u2014and most of their companions tower over them. Dick Filth confirms that the contemporary industry\u2019s 5'6\" standard helps a prodigious male organ look even more prodigious on videotape, a medium that apparently does all kinds of strange things to perspective.\n\nTickets for Saturday\u2019s main event are $195 per, in advance. It\u2019s unclear whether any Insiders\u2019 tickets are comped, but journalists pay full retail. Our tickets designate our table as #189. Twenty-five hundred tickets have been sold, and since it\u2019s highly doubtful that anybody got past the flinty-eyed casino guys outside without a ticket, tonight\u2019s attendance can confidently be fixed at 2,500.\nThe Caesars Forum ballroom itself is a huge L-shape with the stage at the\u2014as it were\u2014joint; thus half of the 15th Annual AVN Awards\u2019 audience is geometrically invisible to the other half. This problem is addressed via six sail-sized video screens that hang from the ceiling at strategic points throughout the auditorium. During the nearly two hours37 between when the doors open and the Awards show actually starts, the screens alternate quick clips from porn classics38 (recall that the theme of the 15th AAVNAs is \u201cThe History of Adult\u201d) with live shots of various people making their entrances and mugging for the remote cameras AVN has got circling the room.\n\nBoth Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth have come equipped with binoculars (H.H.\u2019s in a very official-looking Audubon Society case), which seems mysterious until we all arrive at Table 189, which is at the very, very back of the ballroom\u2019s L\u2019s northern leg, hundreds of yards from even the nearest video screen. \u201cThey always put the print guys out in mookland,\u201d Hecuba explains. This fact is unpleasant surprise #1. Unpleasant surprise #2 is the supper the $195 includes, which turns out to be buffet-steam-table-style and might best be described by inviting you to imagine a very cosmopolitan and multiethnic hospital cafeteria. 39 Several of the male Insiders, we now notice, have brought in their own picnic hampers.\n\nNow moving w/ laden plate to a table near us is a man in a full-body leopardskin suit whose way of acknowledging people he knows is to point at them rather than wave at them. On his arm is a B-girl in a body stocking made of what appears to be a densely woven net. Two Astral Ocean Cinema contract starlets have on identical copper-colored beaded gowns with myriad lengthwise slits in the skirt parts\u2019 fronts and backs and sides, so that as they walk to their table their upper halves look normal and their lower halves seem to be passing through an infinity of bead curtains. Obviously, the whole scene is overwhelming. The average American rarely gets to see aerobic legwarmers with 4\" spike heels. The Caesars Forum ceiling is the color of rancid meringue; it has 24 chandeliers that are designed to look like concentric opened fans but actually look more like labia or very well-organized fungus. Mr. Joey Buttafuoco is in the house, accompanying40 Al Goldstein of Screw, who is here to receive a Special AVN Achievement Award for His Lifelong Defense of the First Amendment. Black is so resoundingly In this year that even the starched linen napkins at everyone\u2019s place settings are black. The wineglasses all have little frosted cameos of J. Caesar on them. Humorless men with walkie-talkies stand guard at each of the ballroom\u2019s fire doors\u2014apparently last year there were some problems with unauthorized Caesars Palace employees sneaking in to watch the gala. The video screens are now showing the climactic scene of Debbie Does Dallas, the one where the nebbishy little stand-in for all mooks everywhere finally has sex with Bambi Woods and then the screen flashes \u201cNEXT?\u201d The South Park boys are indeed in attendance, up at Table 37 w/ Farrel and the XPlor coterie. There are also rumors that Boogie Nights auteur Paul Thomas Anderson possesses a ticket to the gala and might show up.41\n\nThe closest thing to any kind of Insider table near ours is #182, which according to its black table-tent is reserved for Anabolic Video (not an industry force) and is currently occupied by a spiriferously coiffed and sullenly chewing Dina Jewel (who declines to return Harold Hecuba\u2019s blown kiss) and her escort, a young fellow whom one can easily envision head-butting somebody in a mosh pit. D. Filth confides that this Anabolic guy is a close friend of woodman Vince Vouyer (again, sic), who himself is not up for many \u201998 Awards because he spent a good part of the past year in court and/or detention for helping operate an escort service which authorities alleged was not a bona fide escort service at all.\n\nIt turns out that Hecuba and Filth have kept from yr. correspondents as unpleasant surprise #3 the single chintziest thing about the $195-a-head 15th AAVNAs banquet & gala: Beverages are not compris. And not just alcohol, either; even a lousy club soda w/ lime42 is $6.00. Worse, it turns out you can\u2019t run any sort of tab\u2014you have to pay the waiter in cash when you order the lousy club soda w/ lime, and he (theoretically) brings your change back with the beverage. Thus a separate and memory-intensive transaction is required for each drink that each of the six-to-eight persons at each of the appr. 375 tables in the auditorium might order, with additional complications if certain people are buying drinks for certain tablemates but not for certain other tablemates, etc.43 The whole unfree-drink situation is incredibly annoying, not only because of the outlandish ticket price but because the ballroom\u2019s 100 percent Middle Eastern waiters (decent and hardworking fellows all, to be sure, who are taking some serious abuse about the pay-as-you-go beverage policy from mooks with cigars at the nearby tables, despite the fact that the waiters don\u2019t make the rules and must surely find having to remember and make change for six to eight different customers per table a piercing pain in the ass44 ) have only rudimentary ESL skills and tend to confuse both drink orders and currency denominations. Dick Filth leans over and shouts: \u201cNow you can maybe see why this is a multibillion-a-year industry\u2014they\u2019re tight as a duck\u2019s butt!\u201d45\n\nThe crowd lingers over hypersucrotic cake and coffee and $9.00 cordials and howls conversation at itself for 90 more minutes before the house lights dim and the 15th Annual AVN Awards gala starts. What follows thereon is a kaleidoscopic flux of stilted acceptances and blue one-liners and epileptic strobes and spotlights following winners\u2019 serpentine and high five-studded paths to the stage, of everything from generic Awards Show schmaltz to moments of near-Periclean eloquence, as in e.g.:\n\n\u201cFellow MENSA members and aficionados of Shakespeare!\u201d intones Al Goldstein of Screw, 62 and obese and white-bearded and crazy-haired and dressed in a sportcoat whose lapels are two different primary colors, looking pretty much exactly like that one certain old guy in the neighborhood your mom warned you never to try to sell Cub Scout chocolate mints to, and glorying in a Special AVN Achievement Award he confesses to feeling he\u2019s long deserved. \u201cI want to thank my mother, who spread her legs and made all this possible.\u201d Large sections of the crowd are on their feet\u2014Goldstein is a porn icon. He was distributing NYC\u2019s Screw on photostat when most of the people in this room were still playing with their toes. He\u2019s been a First Amendment ninja. He drinks in the applause and loves it and is hard not to sort of almost actually like. He\u2019s clearly an avatar of contemporary porn\u2019s unabashedness, its modern Yeah-OK-I\u2019m-Scum-but-Underneath-All-Your-Hypocrisy-So- Are-You-and-at-Least-I-Have-the-Guts-to-Admit-It-and-Have-a-Good-Time persona:\n\n\u201cI salute the women with eleven-IQs and the men with eleven-inch cocks. The real heroes are the cocks and pussies who fuck on-screen. They\u2019re the real heroes.\u201d Goldstein is less conducted than borne back to his seat.\n\nThis has followed Robert Schimmel\u2019s intro and a 20-minute \u201cMusical Salute to the History of Adult,\u201d in which topless dancing girls do a medley of disco, new wave, and so on.46 The stage band is ragged and unevenly amplified, and they all have flared collars and tight perms\u2014it\u2019s like watching The Brady Bunch\u2019s final season through borrowed binoculars. The stage is lit by autotrack spotlights whose colors alternate w/o discernible scheme.\n\nThe whole 15th AAVNAs Show lasts 3.5 hours and resembles nothing so much as an obscene and extremely well-funded high school assembly. The mix of garish self-congratulation47 and clumsy choreography is often so weird as to be endearing. There are never fewer than six presenters for each award, and they never seem to know whose turn it is to announce a nominee, and there are always a couple who don\u2019t get close enough to the mike to be audible and a couple others who get too close to the mike and produce a jolt of feedback that sends people and cocktails flying out of chairs in the first rows of tables. Wicked Pictures\u2019 Satyr, a multiple-category nominee, gets repeatedly pronounced \u201cSatter.\u201d Winners are supposed to exit stage-left after their acceptance speeches, but even people who\u2019ve won and been through the process several times in recent years keep forgetting and trying to exit stage-right and colliding with the hostesses who are there to escort them leftward. Some presenters insert brief rote antidrug messages into their intros, while around them twitch and sniff other presenters\u2014not many, but some\u2014who are obviously coked to the gills.\n\nProbably the most neutral and economical thing to say is that large parts of the ceremony are unintentionally funny. Winning woodmen extend earnest thanks to directors and execs for giving them \u201can opening\u201d or \u201ca shot\u201d or \u201cmy big shot\u201d and seem wholly unaware of the carnal entendres involved. Back at the journalists\u2019 table with us is a 40ish woman in two-piece Armani who\u2019s doing a spot on the Awards for ABC Radio; she spends most of the evening hunched over with her head in her hand and her tape recorder not even on. Dick Filth spends the show\u2019s whole second hour trying to track down a waiter who owes him beverage change. AVN\u2019s Gene Ross pays tribute to \u201998\u2019s Male Performer of the Year by saying: \u201cYou haven\u2019t lived until you\u2019ve seen Tom Byron\u2019s wrinkled nuts on a seventy-inch TV screen.\u201d Rob Black\u2019s Miscreants keeps getting nominated in category after category, and time and again there\u2019s a frantic caucus at the podium about the correct pronunciation of miscreant, complete with a couple of presenters audibly whispering what in the fuck is the word even supposed to mean.48\n\nTo be fair, some of the nominated products\u2019 titles are genuinely confusing. Triple Penetration Debutante Sluts 4 is up for Most Outrageous Sex Scene\u2014along with Wild Bananas on Butt Row and 87 and Still Bangin\u2019\u2014but loses out to a scene the Program entitles \u201cAnal Food Express\u201d49 from a video called My Girlfriend\u2019s Girlfriend. Paul Thomas\u2019s Bad Wives wins Best Film. Evil Angel\u2019s Buda wins Best Shot-on-Video Feature. The Best Foreign Release statuette goes to something European called President By Day, Hooker By Night. Bad Wives also wins Best Actress/Film for Dyanna Lauren, Best Supporting Actress/Film for Melissa Hill, and Best Anal Sex Scene/Film50 for Lauren and Steven St. Croix. Best Compilation Tape honors go to The Voyeur\u2019s Favorite Blow Jobs & Anals. David Cronenberg\u2019s mainstream Crash comes out of absolutely nowhere to win something called Best Alternative Adult Feature Film. Ms. Stephanie Swift wins Best Actress/Video and tells the crowd: \u201cThanks, everybody. My gang bang was a blast.\u201d51\n\nMax Hardcore, to Table 189\u2019s immense and unkind delight, doesn\u2019t win one single thing.\n\nAn actor named Jim Buck wins AVN\u2019s Gay Performer of the Year Award, and you better believe yr. corresps. sit bolt upright when the person who appears onstage to accept the award is a pink and leptosomatic 4'10\" and is wearing an Eton collar and appears, even under 125X binoculation, to be a twelve-year-old boy. And it turns out it is a twelve-year-old boy: It\u2019s Jim Buck\u2019s little brother. \u201cJim can\u2019t be here tonight because he\u2019s performing in a Shakespeare festival in New Orleans,\u201d the little boy says (correspondential expressions of bug-eyed inquiry at Hecuba and Filth\u2014Shakespeare festival? sending a prepubescent relative to collect your excellence-in-filmed-sodomy prize?\u2014are met with bemused shrugs), \u201cbut I\u2019m here to thank you on his behalf, and to say that I taught Jim everything he knows.\u201d [Enormous audience laugh and ovation, single spasmodic shudder from hunched ABC Radio lady.]\n\nA strange and traumatic experience which one of yr. corrs. will not even try to describe consists of standing at a men\u2019s room urinal between professional woodmen Alex Sanders and Dave Hardman. Suffice it to say that the urge to look over/down at their penises is powerful and the motives behind this urge so complex as to cause anuresis (which in turn ups the trauma). Be informed that male porn stars create around themselves the exact same opaque affective privacy- bubble that all men at urinals everywhere create. The whole Caesars Forum\u2019s men\u2019s room\u2019s urinal area is an angst festival; take it from us. The sink-and-mirror-and-towelette area, however, turns out to be a priceless mash of Insider jargon and shoptalk, all made extra-resonant by echolalic tile and a surfeit of six-dollar drinks. One performer-turned-auteur is telling a colleague about an exciting new project:\n\n\u201cFound this Russian, this chick like nineteen, can\u2019t speak a word of English, which for this [ = for the exciting project] is perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou going to get in there? Just for maybe like one scene?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah. That\u2019s the whole point. I\u2019m the director. This is my package now.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh man though but you got to get in there. Just one scene. Nineteen, no English. Probably got a butthole about this big\u201d [illustrative gesture unseen because auditor is still standing complexly traumatized at urinal].\n\n\u201cWell, we\u2019ll see.\u201d [Mutual laughter replete w/ warmth of genuine friendship, fellow-feeling; exeunt.]\n\nThe Awards Show\u2019s planners have obviously studied at the Oscars\u2019 feet. Not only are the high-profile AVNAs held to the end\u2014though with occasional teasers like Best Supporting thrown into the first two-thirds to keep people attentive52 \u2014but the endless lists of categories and nominees are interspersed with little entr\u2019actes of musical entertainment. Ms. Dyanna Lauren, for instance, appears between Best-Selling Tape and Best Foreign Release to sing her original composition \u201cPsycho Magnet,\u201d a hard-rock ballad about being a porn star and getting constantly stalked and harassed by mentally ill mooks. The song\u2019s argumentation strikes yr. corresps. as a bit uneven, but Ms. Lauren struts and contorts and punctuates her phrasing with uppercuts to the air like a genuine MTV diva. The downside is that vocally, even with heavy amplification and digital synthesis, Dyanna Lauren sounds like a scalded cat, although Dick Filth points out that so does Alanis Morissette, and H. Hecuba chimes in by shouting: \u201cSay whatever you want about the song-and-dance numbers here, they sure beat what Wahlberg and Reilly were coming up with in Boogie Nights!\u201d\n\nHecuba\u2019s claim seems unassailable until right before the Best Boxcover Concept category, when suddenly a piano is wheeled out for a chinless middle-aged man in the same sort of undersize porkpie that Art Carney always wore in The Honeymooners. This entertainer, who is introduced as \u201cDoctor Dirty\u2014the Dirtiest Musician in the History of Music,\u201d proceeds to belt out obscene parodies of popular ditties that put Table 189 in mind of Mad magazine if everyone at Mad somehow all lost their mind at the same time. \u201cJust got home from prison./My asshole is fizzin\u2019./Goo goo goo drippin\u2019 out my back door\u201d is the only snatch of actual lyrics that persists in memory, though titles like \u201cSit on a Happy Face\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s a Small Dick After All\u201d have proved maddeningly hard to forget. Nobody at or around our table has ever heard of Doctor Dirty before, but almost everyone agrees that he\u2019s the \u201998 gala\u2019s low point and a credible rival for Scotty Schwartz\u2019s 1997 seminude rendition of \u201cThank Heaven for Little Girls\u201d as the most repellent AVNA interlude in modern memory. There\u2019s also the \u201998 ceremony\u2019s climax, in which Midori53 and two other starlets take the stage as \u201cthe Spicy Girls\u201d and do a rappish 4/4 number that ends with pretty much every female porn performer in the crowd54 up on stage dancing lasciviously and blowing kisses at the AVN cameras. This climactic distaff shindig apparently caps the Awards every year.\n\nSomething else happens every year. It\u2019s never part of AVN\u2019s videotape of the gala, but it\u2019s a tradition that finally explains why the ballroom\u2019s poor waiters are willing to spend five hours enduring beverage abuse and scuttling around to find change. After the Awards Show is over and the lights go up, some of the starlets always pose for obscene snapshots with the Forum\u2019s waiters. A lot of this year\u2019s picture-taking happens at the back, right near our table. One waiter stands with his arm around the shoulders of Leanna Hart, who pulls down the starboard side of her strapless taffeta and allows the waiter to cup her right breast while Table 189\u2019s own personal waiter55 snaps the photo. Another waiter goes around behind Ms. Ann Amor\u00e9\u2014a very personable black lady with a 50-inch bust and gang tattoos all down both arms\u2014and hunches over behind her as she bends forward and releases her breasts from confinement, and the waiter paws them and tries to look like he\u2019s having intercourse with her from behind as his friend\u2019s flash goes off. What the waiters are going to do with these photos is unguessable, but they\u2019re visibly thrilled, and the starlets are patient and obliging with them in the same blank, distant way that they were with the mooks at the Adult CES.\n\nTrying to leave after the AAVNAs gala is another slow process, because the broad hallway outside the ballroom is again filled with industry people with Caesar-cameo\u2019d glasses they\u2019ve somehow forgotten to leave at their tables, all standing in clumps and congratulating one another and making plans for various Insider parties later. But the slowest, scariest egressive part is traversing the long glass vestibule to the hotel\u2019s side exit. A mass of fans and Caesars Palace custodians and assorted other civilians are there, and the crowd parts slightly to allow a narrow passage for the Awards\u2019 attendees, who must run this gauntlet nearly single file. It\u2019s late, and everyone\u2019s tired, and this crowd has none of the awestruck reticence of the cabstand\u2019s spectators earlier. Now it\u2019s like every mook has his own special high-volume comment for the passing stars, and there\u2019s a weird mix of adulation and derision:\n\n\u201cLove you, Brittany!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d you get that dress on, baby?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook over here!\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes your mother know where you\u2019re at right now?\u201d\n\nOne florid 30ish man holding a plastic cup of beer now reaches out from the crowd and very deliberately pinches the breast of the B-girl walking just in front of us. She slaps his hand away without breaking stride. Because we cannot see her face, we don\u2019t know whether there is any reaction there at all. We have an informed guess, though.\n\nMr. Dick Filth is behind us with one hand on each of yr. corresps.\u2019 shoulders (we\u2019re basically supporting him out). Everyone\u2019s ears are still ringing, and Filth knows enough to almost shout:\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cwe\u2019ve also got the XRCO Awards in February. X-Rated Critics Organization Awards\u2014you get me? They\u2019re not in Vegas, and they\u2019re not rigged. And yet they manage to be just as ridiculous.\u201d5Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/129441", "artist_names": "Dire Straits", "full_title": "Skateaway

Any exhaustive inquiry is well-nigh impossible, and this not so much, perhaps, on account of the wealth of the material, although indeed there is a far vaster field than might generally be supposed, as owing to the very vague definition and indeterminate interpretation one is able to give to vampirism from a purely literary point of view. It is the craft of an artist in the telling of ghost-stories to see that his colours should not be too vivid and too clear, and no mean skill is required to suggest without explanation, to mass the shadows without derangement, to be occult yet not to be obscure. Accordingly it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to differentiate the malignant and death-dealing spectre or it may be even corpse who returns to wreak his foul revenge from the Vampire,--using this latter word in its widest sense, as one must employ it when speaking of literature, a caution which here given as regards this Chapter will serve once for all. In such a story, for example, as Dr. M. R. James' Count Magnus[1] is the horrible revenant a ghost or a vampire? The writer has left the point ambiguous. It is of the very essence of his happy invention that he should do so, and the deftly veiled incertitude adds to the loathly terror of the thing. It will be readily remembered that the story relates how a traveller in Sweden about the middle of the last century whilst staying near an ancient manor house in Vestergothland obtains permission to examine the family papers and among these he comes upon the traces of a certain Count Magnus de la Gardie who in the year 1600 had built the house or herrg\u00e5rd. Even after the lapse of two and a half centuries dark traditions are still lingering concerning this mysterious nobleman, whose body lies in a richly ornate copper sarcophagus that stands the principal feature of a domed mausoleum at the eastern end of the church. Reluctantly the landlord tells a story which happened in the time of his grandfather ninety-two years before. Two men determined to go at night and have a free hunt in the woods upon the estate. They are warned: \"No, do not go; we are sure you will meet with persons walking who should not be walking. They should be resting, not walking.\" The two men laughed and cried: \"The Count is dead; we do not care for him.\" But in the night the villagers \"hear someone scream, just as if the most inside part of his soul was twisted out of him.\" Then they hear a hideous laugh, \"it was not one of those two men that laughed, and, indeed, they have all of them said that it was not any man at all.\" In the morning they go out with the priest, and they find one of the men dead, killed in so terrible a fashion that they buried him on the spot. \"He was once a beautiful man, but now his face was not there, because the flesh of it was sucked away off the bones.\" The other man is standing with his back against a tree, \"pushing with his hands-pushing something away from him which was not there.\"\n\nThere was some vague gossip that the Count had been \"on the Black Pilgrimage, and had brought something or someone back with him.\" During his investigation of the papers the English traveller, Mr. Wraxall, found a Liber nigrae peregrinationis, or at least a few lines of such a document indicating that the Count had once journeyed to the city of Chorazin and there adored the prince of the air. In careless mood as he is passing near the mausoleum, Mr. Wraxall exclaims: \"Ah, Count Magnus, there you are. I should dearly like to see you.\" He is indiscreet enough to cry out thus flippantly on two further occasions, and at last he is thoroughly alarmed by hearing the sound of metal hinges creaking and he knows that the sarcophagus is slowly opening wide. In a state of frenzied fear he sets out for England the next day, yet turn and double as he will he is everywhere haunted by two hideous figures, a man in a long black cloak and a broad-leafed hat and something in a dark cloak and hood. Upon landing at Harwich he makes his way across country to a neighbouring village, when on looking out of the carriage window he sees at a cross-road the two horrible creatures. He finds a lodging, but within the next forty-eight hours his pursuers fall upon him. He is discovered dead, and in the district it is still remembered how \"the jury that viewed the body fainted, seven of 'em did, and none of 'em wouldn't speak to what they see, and the verdict was visitation of God; and how the people as kep' the 'ouse moved out that same week and went away from that part.\"\n\nThis story may, I think, certainly be considered as Vampire lore, and although it must, of course, be perfectly familiar to all who delight in tales of the supernatural I have related it at some little length here, partly because it is told so excellently well, and partly because it so admirably fulfils and exemplifies the qualities that this kind of literature should possess. It is brief and succinct, although there are many details, but every touch tells. No ghost story should be of any length. The horror and the awe evaporate with prolixity. The ghost is malevolent and odious. In fiction a helpful apparition is a notable weakness, and the whole narrative becomes flabby to a degree. The authentic note of horror is struck in the eerie suggestion which, as we have noticed, is of intent left ill-defined. Nothing could be more crude than an explanation, and it is this banality that often ruins a story which otherwise might be of the very first order.\n\nTo review the traces of vampire legends which appear in sagas, and which are in truth but few and unimportant, seems to be outside our province here, and even more foreign to our purpose would be the present examination of the vampire legend in folk-lore since this has already been dealt with in the course of the preceding chapters, and to regard such traditions merely as literature would be not only to look at them from a wrong perspective but to misrepresent their quality and essentially to pervert their purpose.\nSince some point must be chosen at which to consider vampirism in literature we may most fairly recall to mind the many academic and philosophical treatises upon the Vampire which were rehearsed and discussed in German Universities during the earlier part of the eighteenth century, and these startling themes soon began to attract the attention of poets and literary men. Thus among the poems of Heinrich August Ossenfelder[2] we have a short piece entitled Der Vampir, which is as follows:\n\nMein liebes M\u00e4gdchen glaubet\nBest\u00e4ndig steif und feste,\nAn die gegebnen Lehren\nDer immer frommen Mutter\nAls V\u00f6lker an der Theyse\nAn t\u00f6dtliche Vampiere\nHeyduckisch feste glauben,\nNun warte nur Christianchen,\nDu willst mich gar nich lieben;\nIch will mich an dir r\u00e4chen,\nUnd heute in Tockayer\nZu einem Vampir trinken.\nUnd wenn du sanfte schlummerst,\nVon deinen sch\u00f6nen Wangen\nDen frischen Purpur saugen.\nAlsdenn wirst du erschrecken,\nWenn ich dich werde k\u00fcssen\nUnd als ein Vampir k\u00fcssen:\nWann du dann recht erzitterst\nUnd matt in meine Arme,\nGleich einer Todten sinkest\nAlsdenn will ich dich fragen,\nSind meine Lehren besser,\nAls deiner guten Mutter?\nThe poet Wieland[3] has a passing reference to the Vampire\n\nDer J\u00fcngling aus den Wolken\nHerab gefallen, stumm und bleich,\nAls h\u00e4tt' ein Vampyr ihm die Adern ausgemolken,\nSteht ganz vernichtet von dem Streich.[4]\n\nIt would be an exaggeration to say that the Vampire entered German literature with Goethe's famous ballad Die Braut von Korinth, but it would be difficult to over-estimate the influence and the popularity of this piece, the subject of which is directly derived from Phlegon of Tralles. The young Athenian who visits his father's old friend to whose daughter he has been betrothed receives at midnight the Vampire body of the girl whom death has prevented from becoming his bride, and who declares:\n\nAus dem Grabe werd' ich ausgetrieben,\nNoch zu suchen das vermifste Gut,\nNoch den schon verlornen Mann zu lieben Und zu saugen seines Herzens Blut.\nIst's um den geschehn,\nMuss nach andern gehn,\nUnd das junge Volk erliegt der Wut.[6]\n\nEven more famous are the charnel horrors of B\u00fcrger's Lenore which was first printed in 1773 in the Gottinger Musenalmanach and which notwithstanding the legions of hostile comments and parodies whereof Brandl gives an ample list[6] has remained a household word.\n\nIn spite of the immense enthusiasm at that date in contemporary England for German romantic literature it is remarkable that no translation of Lenore was published here until 1796, when William Taylor of Norwich printed in the Monthly Review of March his rendering which in some respects must be called an adaptation. He had, however, by his own account written the translation as early as 1790,[7] and there can be no doubt that very shortly after its completion it was declaimed, applauded and much discussed in Norwich literary circles. We know that Mrs. Barbauld who visited Edinburgh \"about the summer of 1793 or 1794\"[8] read aloud Taylor's version to a number of enthusiastic admirers. This event was described to Sir Walter Scott by Miss Cranstoun, afterwards Countess Purgstall,[9] although Scott himself mentions that his curiosity \"was first attracted to this truly romantic story by a gentleman, who, having heard Lenore once read in manuscript, could only recollect the general outline, and part of a couplet, which, from the singularity of its structure, and frequent recurrence,[10] had remained impressed on his memory.\"[11] This gentleman Was Mr. Cranstoun, the brother of Countess Purgstall, and so her statement is no doubt accurate as Scott might well have received his account both from the brother as well as from the sister. It was in the course of 1794, or at any rate early in the following year that Scott made his own rendering of the ballad. The account of Taylor's version, Ellenore, which \"electrified\" the assembled company at Dugald Stewart's house when read by the famous Anna Letitia Barbauld had given him the strongest desire to see the original. Just about this time, however, it was a difficult matter to procure books from the continent, and it was not until after some delay that a copy of B\u00fcrger's works was conveyed to him from Hamburg. He immediately devoured the German ballad and was so impressed that he forthwith set about Englishing it. \"I well recollect\" he writes, \"that I began my task after supper, and finished it about daybreak next morning.\"[12] Scott's friends privately printed a few copies of the poem as a surprise for the author,\" and as it went from hand to hand it met with the most flattering reception. In 1796, besides the public issue of the translations from B\u00fcrger by Taylor and by Scott, no less than three other versions appeared, from the several pens of W. R. Spencer, H. J. Pye and J. T. Stanley. The translation by the last named author was given to the public in an \u00e9dition de luxe at five shillings, as well as in the ordinary edition of half a crown.[14] In 1797, a pasquil followed, Miss Kitty: a Parody on Lenora, a Ballad, \"Translated from the German, by several Hands,\" whilst in the following year, Mrs. Taylor turned the popular poem into Italian as a \"Novella Morale.\"[15] Probably the most faithful, if not the most spirited translation, was that by the Rev. J. Beresford which was published in 1800.\n\nIt was in 1797 that Coleridge wrote the first part of Christabel, and German critics have somewhat superfluously endeavoured to emphasize herein the influence of Lenore, since upon examination it would hardly seem that such is present even in the smallest degree. For example, if the narrative of Geraldine be carefully read[16] it must be evident that the following judgment of Professor Brandl is without foundation. This critic writes: \"Ihre Vorgeschichte (of Geraldine) sch\u00f6pfte er grossentheils aus B\u00fcrgers 'Lenore' in Taylors Uebersetzung: die Dame ist, wenigstens ihrer Erz\u00e4hlung nach, auf einem windschnellen Ross entf\u00fchrt und halbtodt vor Furcht hier abgesetzt worden; statt des schwarzen Leichenzuges, der Lenoren auf ihrem Ritt durch die Mondnacht aufstiess, will sie 'den Schatten der Nacht' gekreuzt haben; noch zittert das verdorrte Blatt neben ihr wie aus Herzenangst.\"[17]\n\nAs we might expect, the young Shelley was enchanted by Lenore, and Medwin relates how the poet long treasured cc a copy of the whole poem, which he made with his own hand.\"[18] Dowden tells the story how one Christmas Eve Shelley dramatically related the B\u00fcrger ballad with appropriate intonation and gesture \"working up the horror to such a height of fearful interest \"that the company fully expected to see Wilhelm stalk into the parlour.\" In his study of Shelley, Charles Middleton has remarked: \"It is hinted, somewhat plausibly, that the Leonora of B\u00fcrgher first awakened his poetic faculty. A tale of such beauty and terror might well have kindled his lively imagination, but his earliest pieces, written about this time, and consisting only of a few ballads, are deficient in elegance and originality, and give no evidence whatever of the genius which soon after declared itself.\"[20] To suggest, as Zeiger would have it,[21] that Lenore influenced the poem which in the romance St. Irvyne[22] Megalina inscribes on the wall of her prison, and which commences:\n\nGhosts of the dead! have I not heard your yelling\nRise on the night-rolling breast of the blast, . . .\nis the merest ineptitude, since these verses are taken almost word for word from \"Lachin y Gair\" in Byron's Hours of Idleness, and that had been published some four years previously.[23]\n\nAs I have elsewhere shown in some detail, Shelley's two juvenile romances owe not only their inspiration but a great deal of their phrasing and noctivagations to Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya: or The Moor, which appeared in 1806, and which, as the poet himself declares \"quite enraptured\" him.[24] It is a very remarkable circumstance that in spite of the extremely plain hint which might profitably have been taken from such poems as Die Braut von Korinth and Lenore the novelists of the Gothic school, soaked though they were in German literature, searching the earth and the depths of the earth for thrills and sensation of every kind, do not seem to have utilized the tradition of the Vampire. It is a puzzle indeed if we ask how it was that such writers as Monk Lewis, \"Apollo's sexton,\" who would fain \"make Parnassus a churchyard\";[25] and Charles Robert Maturin who, as he himself confessed, loved bells rung by viewless hands, daggers encrusted with long shed blood, treacherous doors behind still more treacherous tapestry, mad nuns, apparitions,[26] et hoc genus omne; the two lords of macabre romance, should neither of them have sent some hideous vampire ghost ravening through their sepulchral pages. In the Gothic romance we have horror heaped on horror's head; mouldering abbeys, haunted castles, banditti, illuminati, sorcerers, conspirators, murderous monks and phantom friars, apparitions without number until the despairing reviewers cried aloud: \"Surely the misses themselves must be tired of so many stories of ghosts and murders.\" We have such titles as the famous Horrid Mysteries; The Midnight Groan; The Abbot of Montserrat, or, The Pool of Blood; The Demon of Venice; The Convent Spectre; The Hag of the Mountains;[27] and a hundred such lurid nomenclatures, but until we come to Polidori's novel which will be considered later, nowhere, so far as I am aware, do we meet with the Vampire in the realm of Gothic fancy. So vast, however, is this fascinating library and so difficult to procure are these novels of a century and a quarter ago that I hesitate sweepingly to assert that this theme was entirely unexploited. There may be some romance which I have not had the good fortune to find where a hideous vampire swoops down upon his victims, but if such be the case I am at least prepared to say that the Vampire was not generally known to Gothic lore, and had his presence made itself felt in the sombre chapters of one votary of this school I think he would have re-appeared on many occasions, for the writers were as accustomed to convey from one another with an easy assurance, as they were wont deftly to plunder the foreign mines. Inevitably one of the band, T. J. Horseley Carties, Francis Lathom, William Herbert, Edward Montague, Mrs. Roche, Eliza Parsons, Miss M. Hamilton, Mrs. Helme, Mrs. Meeke, Isabella Kelley, and many another beside insatiably agog for horrid phantasmagoria would have utilized the Vampire in some funereal episode.\n\nOne might even have supposed that the notes to Southey's Thalaba the Destroyer,[28] must have put them on the track, and surely stanzas eight, nine and ten in Book VIII could not have passed unnoticed:\n\nA night of darkness and of storms!\nInto the Chamber of the Tomb\nThalaba led the Old Man,\nTo roof him from the rain.\nA night of storms! the wind\nSwept through the moonless sky,\nAnd moan'd among the pillar'd sepulchres;\nAnd in the pauses if its sweep\nThey heard the heavy rain\nBeat on the monument above.\nIn silence on Oneiza's grave\nHer father and her husband sate.\nThe Cryer from the Minaret\nProclaim'd the midnight hour.\n\"Now, now!\" cried Thalaba;\nAnd o'er the chamber of the tomb\nThere spread a lurid gleam,\nLike the reflection of a sulphur fire\nAnd in that hideous light\nOneiza stood before them. It was She . . .\nHer very lineaments. . . . and such as death\nHad changed them, livid cheeks and lips of blue;\nBut in her eye there dwelt\nBrightness more terrible\nThan all the loathsomeness of death.\n\"Still art thou living, wretch? \"\nIn hollow tones she cried to Thalaba;\n\"And must I nightly leave my grave\nTo tell thee, still in vain,\nGod hath abandoned thee?\n\n\"This is not she!\" the Old Man exclaim'd;\n\"A Fiend; a manifest Fiend!\"\nAnd to the youth he held his lance;\n\"Strike and deliver thyself!\"\n\"Strike HER!\" cried Thalaba,\nAnd palsied of all power,\nGazed fixedly upon the dreadful form.\n\"Yea, strike her!\" cried a voice, whose tones\nFlow'd with such a sudden healing through his soul,\nAs when the desert shower\nFrom death deliver'd him;\nBut obedient to that well-known voice,\nHis eye was seeking it,\nWhen Moath, firm of heart,\nPerform 'd the bidding: through the vampire corpse\nHe thrust his lance; it fell,\nAnd howling with the wound,\nIts fiendish tenant fled.\nA sapphire light fell on them,\nAnd garmented with glory, in their sight\nOneiza's spirit stood.\n\nIt is important to remark that in his notes[29] upon this passage Southey cites at considerable length various cases of vampirism, particularly from the Lettres Juives, the Vampires of Gradisch, also the history of Arnold Paul, and the very ample account given by Tournefort. He further says: \"The Turks have an opinion that men that are buried have a sort of life in their graves. If any man makes affidavit before a judge, that he heard a noise in a man's grave, he [i.e., the body] is, by order, dug up and chopped all too pieces. The merchants (at Constantinople) once airing on horseback, had, as usual, for protection, a Janisary with them. Passing by the burying place of the Jews, it happened that an old Jew sat by a sepulchre. The Janisary rode up to him, and rated him for stinking the world a second time, and commanded him to get into his grave again--Roger North's Life of Sir Dudley North.\"[30]\n\nIt might perhaps not unfairly be argued that the two notorious romances of the Marquis de Sade Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu and Juliette depict scenes of vampirism, and if we are to take the word in any extended sense this is certainly the case. In the first place it must be remembered that as it passed through various editions-it was first issued in 1791, 2 vols., 8vo,--until it appeared in its final and complete form in 1797 as La Nouvelle Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu, suivie de l'Histoire de Juliette, sa soeur, 10 vols., 18mo (of which Justine occupies four and Juliette six) Justine was added to and augmented until the last version is practically double the length of the first, and the book has been entirely re-written. In Justine we have the episodes in the house of Monsieur Rodin, and more particularly the orgies of the Comte de Gernade who takes a lustful pleasure in watching the blood flow from the veins of his victims, as also the cruelties of the monster Roland all of which. may well be esteemed vampirism. Many similar scenes are described with great prolixity in Juliette, and this romance is distinguished by such horrible figures as the Muscovite giant Minski, whose favourite meat is human flesh, and in whose castle the table and chairs are made of bleaching bones, and Cordelli, the necrophilist of Ancona.\n\nIn The New Monthly Magazine,[31] 1 April, 1819, was published The Vampyre: a Tale by Lord Byron, which although it may seem to us--steeped in Le Fanu and M. R. James--a little old-fashioned, at the time created an immense sensation and had the most extraordinary influence, being even more admired and imitated on the Continent than in England. It was almost immediately known that actually the story did not come from the pen of Lord Byron, but had been written by Dr. John William Polidori, physician-companion to the poet. Byron had, as a matter of fact, been writing a work of the same title in imitation of Mrs. Shelley's Frankenstein, but he denied the authorship of this piece in the famous letter facsimilied in Galignani's edition of his works. A first printed, The Vampyre forms a part of extracts from \"A letter from Geneva, with Anecdotes of Lord Byron.\" Here is to be read that \"among other things which the lady, from whom I procured these anecdotes, related to me, she mentioned the outline of a ghost story by Lord Byron. It appears that one evening Lord Byron, Mr. p. B. Shelley, the two ladies and the gentleman (the daughters of Godwin and Dr. Polidori) before alluded to after having perused a German work, which was entitled Phantasmagoriana[32] began relating ghost stories; when his lordship having recited the beginning of Christabel, then unpublished, the whole took so strong a hold of Mr. Shelley's mind, that he suddenly started up and ran out of the room. The physician and Lord Byron followed, and discovered him leaning against a mantlepiece with cold drops of perspiration trickling down his face. After having given him something to refresh him, upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm, they found that his wild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the ladies with eyes (which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood where he lived) he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy the impression. It was afterwards proposed in the course of conversation, that each of the company present should write a tale depending upon some supernatural agency, which was undertaken by Lord Byron, the physician, and Miss M. Godwin. My friend, the lady above referred to, had in her possession the outline of each of these stories, I obtained them as a great favour, and herewith forward them to you, as I was assured you would feel as much curiosity as myself, to peruse the \u00e9bauches of so great a genius, and those immediately under his influence.\" Upon this the Editor has the following note: \"We have in our possession the Tale of Dr. ------ as well as the outline of that of Miss Godwin. The latter has already appeared under the title of 'Frankenstein, or the modern Prometheus'; the former, however, upon consulting this author, we may, probably, hereafter give to our readers.\"\n\nThe Vampyre is introduced by several paragraphs which deal with the tradition. This preamble commences: \"The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common; it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human bloodsuckers fattened--and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\"\n\nThe Editor then recounts the famous instance of Arnold Paul, and continues: \"We have related this monstrous rodomontade, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance we could adduce. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is doomed to vampyrise, but be compelled to confine his visitations solely to those beings he loved most while on earth-those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection. This supposition is, we imagine, alluded to in the following fearfully sublime and prophetic curse from the 'Giaour.'[32]\n\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent,\nThy corse shall from its tomb be rent;\nThen ghastly haunt thy native place,\nAnd suck the blood of all thy race;\nThere from thy daughter, sister, wife, p. 283\nAt midnight drain the stream of life;\nYet loathe the banquet, which perforce\nMust feed thy livid living corse,\nThy victims, ere they yet expire,\nShall know the demon for their sire;\nAs cursing thee, thou cursing them,\nThy flowers are withered on the stem.\nBut one that for thy crime must fall,\nThe youngest, best beloved of all,\nShall bless thee with a father's name--\nThat word shall wrap thy heart in flame!\nYet thou must end thy task and mark\nHer check's last tinge--her eye's last spark,\nAnd the last glassy glance must view\nWhich freezes o'er its lifeless blue;\nThen with unhallowed hand shall tear\nThe tresses of her yellow hair,\nOf which, in life a lock when shorn\nAffection's fondest pledge was worn--\nBut now is borne away by thee\nMemorial o thine agony!\nYet with thine own best blood shall drip\nThy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;\nThen stalking to thy sullen grave\nGo--and with Ghouls and Afrits rave,\nTill these in horror shrink away\nFrom spectre more accursed than they.\"\n\nAfter an allusion to Southey's Thalaba, Tournefort's Travels, and Dom Calmet's classical work, the editor concludes: \"We could add many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition, and we may, perhaps, resume our observations upon it at some future opportunity; for the present, we feel that we have very far exceeded the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation of the strange production to which we now invite the attention of our readers; and we shall therefore conclude by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several other synonimous with it, which are made use of in various parts of the world, namely, Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\"\n\nThe story tells how at the height of a London season there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose; some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward working of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass.\" This original is invited to every house, and in the course of the winter he meets \"a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey\" he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood.\" Aubrey is greatly fascinated by Lord Ruthven, for this is the name of the mysterious nobleman, and intending to travel upon the Continent he mentions this intention to my Lord, and is \"surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\"\n\nAs they travelled from town to town, Aubrey notices the peculiar conduct of his companion who bestows largess upon the most worthless characters, broken gamblers and the like, but refuses a doit to the deserving and virtuous poor. However the recipients of this charity \"inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they all were either led to the scaffold or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery.\" Eventually the travellers arrive at Rome, and here Aubrey receives letters from his guardians who require him immediately to leave his companion as since their departure from London the most terrible scandals, adulteries and seductions, have come to light. At Rome Aubrey is able to foil Lord Ruthven's plans, frustrating an intrigue designed to ruin a heedless young girl, and then he \"directed his steps towards Greece, and, crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens.\" Here he lodges in the house of a Greek, whose daughter Ianthe is a paragon of the most exquisite beauty. As he sketches the ruins of the city she is wont to entertain him with Greek legend and tradition, and \"often, as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heart-breaking to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\"\n\nBefore long it becomes evident that Aubrey is in love with Ianthe, \"and while he ridicules the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him.\" He endeavours to occupy his time with antiquarian excursions which lead him farther and farther afield, and at length he determines to proceed to a point beyond any he has as yet visited. When Ianthe's parents hear the name of the place he proposes to visit they most earnestly implore him on no account to return when once dusk has fallen, \"as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\"\n\nHaving given his promise to Ianthe that he will be back well before evening he sets out very early. The exploration, however, takes longer than he has supposed, and when he turns his horse homeward the darkness is already hurrying on urged by a terrific storm. The steed, alarmed at the battle of the elements dashes off at breakneck pace and only halts trembling and tired before a distant hovel in the heart of a solitary wood. \"As he approached, the thunder, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stiffled exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound.\" With a terrific effort Aubrey burst open the door and rushing into the darkness \"found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized, when a voice cried \"again baffled,\" to which a loud laugh succeeded, and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled but it was in vain; he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground; his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hand upon his throat, when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him--he instantly rose and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood was not longer heard.\" Several peasants now hastened into the hut bearing flambeaus which illuminate the scene, and to the horror of all there is discovered hard by, the lifeless body of Ianthe. A curious dagger lies near, but her death was not the result of a blow from this weapon. \"There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:--upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:--to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, 'a Vampyre, a Vampyre!'\" It appears that Ianthe had followed the traveller to watch over his safety. Aubrey is carried back to the city in a raging fever, and the parents of the unfortunate girl die brokenhearted owing to so terrible a loss.\n\nWhilst Aubrey lies ill Lord Ruthven arrives in Athens and establishing himself in the same house nurses the invalid with such care that past differences are forgotten, since Aubrey not only becomes reconciled to his presence but even seeks his company. Together they travel into the wildest interior of Greece, and here in some mountain pass they are attacked by brigands, from whose guns Lord Ruthven receives a shot in the shoulder. His strength strangely decreasing, a couple of days later it is plain to all that he is at the point of death. He now exacts a terrific oath that his companion shall conceal all that is known of him and that the news of his death shall not be allowed to reach England. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see.\" Aubrey binds himself most solemnly by the prescribed oath, and in a paroxysm of hideous laughter Ruthven expires.\n\nAccording to a promise which has been obtained from the robbers by a heavy bribe the body was conveyed to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon which rose after his death. Aubrey insists that it shall be interred in the ordinary way, but when he is conducted to the place it is found that the body has disappeared, and in spite of the protestations of the band he is convinced that they have buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes. One circumstance, however, gives Aubrey much food for thought. Among the effects of the deceased he discovered a sheath of most curious pattern and make which exactly fits the dagger that had been found in the deserted hut upon the occasion of Ianthe's death.\n\nReturning to England, as he retraces his journey through Rome to his horror Aubrey discovers that in spite of the precautions he had so carefully taken, Lord Ruthven succeeded only too well in his bad designs and now there is bitter sorrow and distress where once reigned peace and happiness. The lady had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship, and Aubrey instinctively divines that she has \"fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe.\"\n\nUpon his arrival in London the traveller is greeted by his sister, whose presentation into society had been delayed until her brother's return from the Continent, when he might be her protector. \"It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the busy scene.\" Upon this gay occasion the crowd was excessive, and as Aubrey heedless and distracted is watching the gay throng a voice which he recognizes only too well, whispers in this ear: \"Remember\n\np. 288\n\nyour oath.\" Turning he sees Lord Ruthven standing near him. A few nights later at the assembly of a near relation among the crowd of admirers by whom his sister is surrounded--the most prominent of the throng--he again perceives the mysterious and horrible figure. Hurrying forward he seizes his sister's arm and requests her immediately to accompany him home. However, before they have had time to retire again does the voice whisper close to him: \"Remember your oath!\"\n\nAubrey now becomes almost distracted. He sees no remedy against a monster who has already once mocked at death. Even if he were to declare all that he knew it is probable that he would hardly be believed. Whenever he attends a social gathering his looks as he scans the company become so suspicious and strange that he soon acquires a reputation for great eccentricity. As the months go on his loathing and his fears drive him well-nigh to madness, so that eventually a physician is engaged to reside in the house and take charge of him. He is a little consoled by the thought that when the year and the day have passed he will at least be able to unburden his mind and be at any rate freed from his terrible oath. It so happens that he overhears a conversation between the doctor and one of his guardians who enlarges upon the melancholy circumstance of her brother being in so critical a state when Miss Aubrey is to be married on the following day. He instantly demands the name of the bridegroom and is told the Earl of Marsden. He requests to see his sister and in an hour or two she visits him. As they are conversing she opens a locket and shows him a miniature of the man who has won her affections. To his horror he perceives that it is a portrait of Lord Ruthven and falling into convulsions of rage he tramples it under foot. In twenty-four hours the period of his oath will have expired, and he implores them to delay the wedding at least for that time. Since there seems no good reason for doing this the request is disregarded, upon which Aubrey falls into so sad a state of utter depression succeeded by an outburst of fury that the physician concludes him to be not far removed from lunacy and doubles the restraint. During the night the busy preparations for the nuptial are ceaselessly continued. It appears that upon the pretext of being her brother's dearest friend and travelling\n\np. 289\n\ncompanion Lord Ruthven had visited the house to inquire after Aubrey during his supposed derangement, and from the character of a visitor gradually insinuated himself into that of an accepted suitor. When the bridal party has assembled Aubrey, neglected by the servants, contrives to make his way into the public apartments which are decorated for the nuptials. Ere he can utter a cry, he is, however, at once perceived by Lord Ruthven who with more than human strength thrusts him, speechless with rage, from the room, at the same time whispering in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to-day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" The attendants at once secure the unhappy man, but he can no longer support his distress. In his agonies a blood vessel breaks and he is incontinently conveyed to bed. This sad accident is kept from his sister; the marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\n\n\"Aubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused--he died immediately after.\n\n\"The guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a Vampyre!\"\n\nIt were not easy to overestimate the astounding sensation which was caused by this story, and the narrative is certainly not without considerable merit, for in places the eerie atmosphere is well conveyed, Nor is it difficult to understand the extraordinary influence of the tale, since it introduced a tradition which had been long forgotten and which promised infinite possibilities in the way of that sensation and melodramatic calentures which the period craved. The first separate edition of The Vampyre appeared in 1819, and was published by Sherwood. The first issue of this, which is now very rare, contains a certain amount of preliminary matter concerning the Shelleys, Byron and Godwin. This was omitted in later issues, and accordingly one often finds that copies of The Vampyre are described as First Edition, which is strictly quite correct, although they are the Second Issue,\n\np. 290\n\nand naturally of far less value in a bibliographer's eyes. A large number of reprints increased with amazing rapidity and in the same year the novel was translated into French by Henri Faber, Le Vampire, nouvelle traduite de l'anglais de Lord Byron, Paris, 1819. In February, 1820, there followed under the aegis of Charles Nodier a very obvious imitation, or rather continuation by Cyprien B\u00e9rard, Lord Ruthwen ou les Vampires. \"Roman de C. B. Publi\u00e9 par l'auteur de Jean Sbogar et de Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Aubert.[34] Paris, 1820.\" In 1825, a new translation of Polidori's story was given by Eus\u00e8be de Salles. Nor was Germany behind hand, for The Vampyre was first translated in 1819: Der Vampyr. Eine Erzahlung aus dem Englischen des Lord Byron. Nebst einer Schilderung seines Aufenthaltes in Mytilene. Leipzig, 1819. In the following year there appeared at Frankfort a version by J. V. Adrian of Byron's poems and prose, wherein was included Der Blutsuger. In a collection of Byron's work the first volume of which was published at Zwickau in 1821, The Vampyre again found a place in volume V (1821), translated by Christian Karl Meifsner as Der Vampyr. The tale has also been included in various other continental collections and translations of Byron's work even until a recent date.\n\nYet it was well-known all the while that Polidori was the author of the story, but as Byron's was by far the greater name, so this sensational novella must be attributed to the cavaliero whose romantic adventures and the scandal of whose amours were thrilling the whole of Europe. Writing in the same Year as the great poet's death Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Pichot of the University of Marseilles in his Essai sur le g\u00e9nie et le caract\u00e8re de Lord Byron[35] declared that this spurious issue \"a autant contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 faire conna\u00eetre le nom de lord Byron en France, que ses po\u00ebmes les plus estim\u00e9s.\" Publishers insisted upon Le Vampire, \"nouvelle,\" being included among Byron's works, and it is said that Ladvocat was furious when it was represented to him that since it was openly acknowledged that Polidori had written The Vampire, the translation should properly be no longer given among the poet's work nor put forth under his name.\n\nAs might have been expected it was not long before the Vampire appeared upon the stage, and the first play of this kind would seem to be the famous melodrama by Charles\n\np. 291\n\nNodier (with Achille Jouffroy and Carmouche) which with music by Alexandre Piccini and scenery by Ciceri, was produced in Paris on 13th June, 1820, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte-Saint-Martin, whose directors were the popular M. M. Croznier and Merle. The r\u00f4le of Lord Rutwen was taken by M. Philippe; the celebrated Madame Dorval was Malvina;[36] and the new play had an extraordinary success.\n\nIt was immediately published as Le Vampire, m\u00e9lodrame en trois actes avec un prologue, Par M. M. . . .; Musique, de M. Alexandre Piccini; Decors de M. Ciceri. This might be purchased at 1 fr. 25cs. \"au magasin g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de pi\u00e8ces de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, Chez J.-N. Barba, Libraire, Palais Royal, derri\u00e8re le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais, No. 51. \"The characters in the Prologue are Ituriel, ange de la Lune, Mlle. Descotte; Oscar, g\u00e9nie des Mariages, M. Mo\u00ebssard; and Un Vampire, M. Philippe. The scene opens in \"une grotte basaltique,\" the Caledonian caves of Staffa. Oscar and Ituriel discourse of Vampires, and the latter asks: \"Serait-il vrai que d'horribles fant\u00f4mes viennent quelquefois, sous l'apparence des droits de l'hymen, \u00e9gorger une vierge timide, et s'abreuver de son sang?\" This is indeed the case, and it is significant that on the morrow Malvina (Miss Aubray) is to wed \"le comte de Marsden.\" A vision of the sleeping Malvina appears when \"Un spectre v\u00eatu d'un linceuil s'\u00e9chappe de la plus apparente de ces tombes\" and rushes upon her. He is swiftly repulsed by Oscar, the good genius and the curtain falls. The characters in the play are: Lord Rutwen, M. Philippe; Sir Aubray, M. Perrin ou Th\u00e9ringy; Malvina, Mad. Dorval; Brigitte, Mad. St. Amand; Edgar, M. Edmon; Scop, M. Pierson; Petterson, M. Dugy; Lovette, Mlle. J. Vertpr\u00e9; Oscar, M. Mo\u00ebssard; with attendances of Domestiques and Villageois. The drama to a certain extent adroitly follows the lines of the Polidori novel, but with notable changes, which are well contrived and introduced. Lord Rutwen and Aubray have been fellow travellers, but the latter has no suspicion of Rutwen's real nature. In fact he holds him in the dearest affection since once he was saved from death by his friend who, whilst shielding him from a brigand's attack, fell by a chance shot. When Lord Rutwen arrives to claim Malvina's hand it is with delight Aubray hails his preserver on whom he supposed killed by the bandit's gun. It is cleverly explained how\n\np. 292\n\nthe wound did not after all prove fatal, whereupon \"Rutwen, mes desirs sont remplis\" cries Aubray, \"nous allons \u00eatre fr\u00e8res\" (Ils s'embrassent). Lovette a farmer's daughter of the Marsden estate is to wed Edgar, and Rutwen graciously presents himself at the marriage feast. As Lord of the Manor he is received with every respect and homage, but he immediately proceeds to attempt Lovette's virtue. Oscar \"un viellard dont la t\u00eate v\u00e9n\u00e9rable inspire le respect. Sa d\u00e9marche a quelque chose d'imposant et de myst\u00e9rieux,\" has already warned the maiden, and she coldly avoids such ardent importunities. Whilst Rutwen is actually pursuing the coy lass who shuns his embrace, Edgar in a fury fires a pistol at the seducer and he falls crying, \"Je meurs.\" Aubray hastening to the spot is barely in time to receive him in his arms, and with dying lips Rutwen adjures him to swear the following oath. \"Promets-moi que Malvina ne saura point ce qui m'est arriv\u00e9; que tu ne feras rien pour venger ma mort avant que la premi\u00e8re heure de la nuit n'ait sonn\u00e9. Jure-moi le secret sur ce coeur expirant.\" Aubray much moved cries, \"Je to le jure,\" and as Rutwen expires they lay the body gently on the ground. \"A`ce moment on voit la lune planer enti\u00e8rement sur le corps de Rutwen, et \u00e9clairer les gla\u00e7ons de la montagne. La toile tombe.\"\n\nAct III. \"repr\u00e9sente un grand vestibule gothique, la porte de la chapelle se voit au fond.\" Oscar solemnly utters words of warning to Brigitte, who is already full of fears which are not unnoticed by Malvina. When Aubray meets his sister she speaks joyfully of her marriage but as he is about to tell her of the fatal happening suddenly Rutwen appears and seizing his arm \"lui dit d'une voix sombre: 'Songe \u00e0 ton serment'!\" Aubray now realizes that there is some horrid secret and displays violent emotion crying out in broken tones: \"Eloigne-toi fant\u00f4me! . . ma soeur . . . d\u00e9robe-toi, aux poursuites de ce monstre . . . il te dira qu'il est ton \u00e9poux . . . refuse ton serment . . . cet hymen est un crime\" At length he is carried off by the servants who fear that he has lost his senses, an idea Rutwen encourages. In spite of this disorder the bridegroom now hotly presses on the nuptials; the great doors are opened \"et laisse voir la chapelle \u00e9clair\u00e9e,\" Rutwen and Malvina approach the altar. With a wild cry Aubray rushes in to intercept the ceremony,\n\np. 293\n\nupon which the monster drawing his dagger is about to plunge it deep into Malvina's heart when one o'clock strikes,--his power is gone.\" Il laisse tomber son poignard et cherche & s'enfuir, des ombres sortent de la terre et l'entra\u00eenent avec elles; l'Ange exterminateur para\u00eet dans un nuage, la foudre \u00e9clate et les Ombres s'engloutissent avec Rutwen. Pluie de feu. TABLEAU G\u00c9N\u00c9RAL.\"\n\nThe dialogue of this melodrama is spirited, the situations striking and well managed, and even in reading the play, one can clearly visualize that upon the stage it must have been extraordinarily effective, especially when set off with all the attractions of the scene painter's glowing perspectives, the magic craft of the subtle machinist, and the richest adornment of romantic costume.[37] Even before he had introduced the Vampire on to the boards Nodier had prophesied that this macabre monster would win a veritable triumph, and his prediction was amply fulfilled. \"Le Vampire \u00e9pouvantera, de son horrible amour, les songes de toutes les femmes, et bient\u00f4t sans doute, ce monstre encore exhum\u00e9 pr\u00eatera son masque immobile, sa voix s\u00e9pulcrale, son oeil d'un gris mort, . . . tout cet attirail de m\u00e9lodrame \u00e0 la Melpom\u00e8ne des boulevards; et quel succ\u00e8s alors ne lui est pas r\u00e9serv\u00e9!\"[38] On 1st July, 1819, writing in the Drapeau Blanc he was far more serious and far more emphatic: \"La fable du vampire est peut-\u00eatre la plus universelle de nos superstitions. . . Elle a partout l'autorit\u00e9 de la tradition: elle ne manque ni de celle de la th\u00e9ologie ni do celle de la, m\u00e9dicine. La philosophie m\u00eame en a parl\u00e9.\"\n\nAll Paris flocked to see Le Vampire, and nightly the Porte-Saint-Martin was packed to the doors. Philippe and Madame Dorval were applauded to the echo by enthusiastic audiences who recalled them again and again after the final tableau. Even the book of the play had an immense circulation and every morning Barba's counter was freshly stocked with huge piles of the duodecimo, which rapidly diminished during the day.\n\nNot a few critics, however, adopted a very uncompromising attitude, and were unsparing in their condemnation of so popular a melodrama. In Les Lettres Normandes, 1820, (tome XI, p. 93) Le Vampire was thus noticed: \"Le m\u00e9lodrame du Vampire dans lequel on voit para\u00eetre un monstre\n\np. 294\n\nqui suce le sang des petites filles et qui offre des Tableaux qu'une honn\u00eate femme ne pout voir sans rougir, est l'ouvrage de MM. Ch. Nodier, r\u00e9dacteur du Drapeau Blanc; Achille Jouffroy, r\u00e9dacteur de La Gazette et auteur des Festes de l'anarchie; et Carmouche autre r\u00e9dacteur du Drapeau Blanc.\" This censure is, however, wholly inspired by political feeling which thus inveighed against the royalist Nodier, and which not unmingled with green jealousy we also find prominent in the Conservateur litt\u00e9raire of April, 1820 (Tome II, p. 245) where we had: \"Pour balancer le succ\u00e8s du Vampire m\u00e9lodrame d\u00e9go\u00fbtant et si monstreux que les auteurs MM. Ch. Nodier et Carmouche m'ont pas os\u00e9 se faire conna\u00eetre, le th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte-Saint-Martin se pr\u00e9pare \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter la traduction litt\u00e9rale, en prose, de la Marie Stuart de Schiller.\"\n\nYet another critic is even more trenchant and severe: \"Le Vampire Ruthwen veut violer ou sucer dans les coulisses une jeune fianc\u00e9e qui fuit devant lui sur le th\u00e9\u00e2tre: cette situation est-elle morale? . . . Toute la pi\u00e8ce repr\u00e9sente indirectement Dieu comme un \u00eatre faible ou odieux qui abandonne le monde aux g\u00e9nies de l'enfer.\"[39]\n\nYet all these attacks served but to enhance the attraction, and it is remarkable for how many years this continued undiminished. In 1823 a revival of Le Vampire with Philippe and Madame Dorval again thronged the Porte-Saint-Martin to excess. Alexandre Dumas, who was present at this production has recorded how vast was his delight, how ineffable his thrills during the sombre scenes of this sepulchral melodrame. How the theatre applauded the lean livid mask of the Vampire, how it shuddered at his stealthy steps! There are, perhaps, to be found throughout the whole of the many works of Alexandre, Dumas few pages more entertaining than those chapters in his Memoires which relate with rarest humour and not a few flashes of brilliant wit his adventures at a performance of Le Vampire at the Porte-Saint-Martin in 1823. It would be difficult to find a livelier, and yet at the same time entirely serious and even critical, account of a theatrical performance. Unfortunately it is too long to give in full. In the edition of Mes M\u00e9moires, Troisi\u00e8me S\u00e9rie, Michel L\u00e9vy, Paris, 1863, it occupies no less than five chapters, LXXIII-LXXVII, and these are none of the shortest, (pp. 136-193). One is tempted to quote some delicious passages, but the\n\np. 295\n\naccount might lose thereby; it must be read as a delightful whole. Yet there is one extract which May certainly be made without impertinence, the story of the Vampire which was related to Dumas by his neighbour \"le monsieur poli qui lisait un Elz\u00e9vir.\" They have discussed the tradition at some length, and incidentally the good bibliophile refers his young acquaintance to the work of Dom Calmet, from whom he gives ample citations. He further remarks that he has resided in Illyria for three years, and he very sharply animadverts upon certain details on Nodier's melodrama which are foreign to the vampire tradition. \"You speak of vampires as though they really existed,\" remarks Dumas. \"Of course they exist,\" said his neighbour dryly. \"Have you ever seen one then?\" \"Most certainly I have.\" \"That was whilst you were in Illyria?\" \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Et vous y avez vu des vampires?\"\n\n\"Vous savez que c'est la, terre claissique des vampires, l'Illyrie, comme la Hongrie, la Servie, la Pologne.\n\n\"Non, je no sais pas . . . je ne sais rien. O\u00f9 \u00e9taient ces vampires que vous avez vus?\n\n\"A Spalatro. Je logeais chez un bonhomme de soixante-deux ans. Il mourut. Trois jours apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 enterr\u00e9, il apparut la nuit \u00e0 son fils et lui demanda \u00e0 manger; son fils le servit selon des desirs; il mangea et disparut. Le lendemain, le fils me raconta ce qui lui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9, me disant que bien certainement son p\u00e8re ne reviendrait pas pour une fois, et m'invitant a me mettre, la nuit suivante, \u00e0 une fen\u00eatre pour le voir entrer et sortir. J'\u00e9tais curieux de voir un vampire. Je me mis \u00e0 la fen\u00eatre; mais, cette nuit-la, il ne vint pas. Le fils me dit, alors, do ne pas me d\u00e9courager, qu'il viendrait probablement la nuit suivante.--La nuit suivante, je me remis donc \u00e0 ma fen\u00eatre, et, en effet, vers minuit, je reconnus parfaitement le vieillard. Il venait du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de cimeti\u00e8re; il marchait d'un bon pas; mais son pas ne faisait aucun bruit. Arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la porte, il frappa,; je comptai trois coups; les coups r\u00e9sonn\u00e8rent secs sur le ch\u00eane, comme si l'on eut frapp\u00e9 avec un os, et non avec un doigt. Le fils, vint ouvrir la porte, et le vieillard entra. . . .\n\n\"J'\u00e9coutais ce r\u00e9cit avec la plus grande attention, et je commen\u00e7ais \u00e0 pref\u00e8rer les entr'actes au m\u00e9lodrame.\n\n\"Ma curiosit\u00e9 \u00e9tait trop vivement excit\u00e9e, reprit men voisin,\n\np. 296\n\npour que je quittasse ma fen\u00eatre; j'y demeurai donc. Une demi-heure apr\u00e8s, le vieillard sortit; il retournait d'o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait venu, c'est-a-dire du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du cimetiere. A l'angle d'une muraille, il disparut. Presque au m\u00eame instant, ma porte s'ouvrit. Je me retournai vivement, c'\u00e9tait son fils. It \u00e9tait fort p\u00e2le. 'Et bien, lui dis-je, votre p\u00e8re est venu?--Oui . . . L'avez-vous vu entrer? Entrer et sortir. . . Qu'a-t-il fait aujourd'hui? Il m'a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 boire et \u00e0 manger, comme l'autre jour. Et il a bu et mang\u00e9? Il a bu et mang\u00e9 . . . Mais ce n'est pas le tout. . . voici ce qui m'inqui\u00e8te. . . Il m'a dit . . . Ah! il vous a parl\u00e9 pour autre chose que pour vous demander \u00e0, boire et a manger? . . . Oui, il m'a dit: 'Voici deux fois que je viens manger chez toi. C'est \u00e0 ton tour maintenant de venir manger chez moi.' Diable! . . . Je l'attends apr\u00e8s demain \u00e0 la m\u00eame heure. Diable! Diable! Eh! oui, justement, voil\u00e0 ce qui me tracasse.' Le surlendemain, on le trouva mort dans son lit! Ce m\u00eame jour, deux ou trois autres, personnes du m\u00eame village qui avaient vu aussi le vieillard, et qui lui avaient parl\u00e9, tomb\u00e8rent malades et moururent \u00e0 leur tour. Il fut donc reconnu que le vieillard \u00e9tait vampire. On s'informa aupr\u00e8s de moi; je racontai ce que favais vu et entendu. La justice se transporta au cimeti\u00e8re. On ouvrit les tombeaux de tous ceux qui \u00e9taient morts depuis six semaines; tous ces, cadavres \u00e9taient en d\u00e9composition. Mais, quand on en vint au tombeau de Kisilova,--c'\u00e9tait le nom du vieillard,--on le trouva les yeux ouverts, la bouche vermeille, respirant \u00e0 pleins poumons, et cependant immobile, comme mort. On lui enfon\u00e7a un pieu dans le coeur; il jeta un grand cri, et rendit le sang par le bouche; puis on le mit sur un b\u00fbcher, on le r\u00e9duisit en cendre, et l'on jeta la cendre au vent. . . . Quelque temps apr\u00e8s, je quittai le pays de sorte que je ne pus savoir si son fils \u00e9tait devenu vampire comme lui.\n\n\"Pourquoi serait-il devenu vampire comme lui? demandai-je.\n\n\"Ah! parce que c'est l'habitude, que les personnes qui meurent du vampirisme deviennent vampires.\n\n\"En v\u00e9rit\u00e9, vous dites cela comme si c'\u00e9tait un fait av\u00e9r\u00e9.\n\n\"Mais c'est qu'aussi c'est un fait av\u00e9r\u00e9, connu, enregistr\u00e9!\"\n\nIt will readily be remembered that in Monte-Cristo when\n\np. 297\n\nduring the performance of Parisina at the Teatro Argentino, Rome, the Count and Haid\u00e9e enter their box, the Countess G------ directing her opera-glass in that direction asks Franz d'Epinay who they may be remarking that as for herself, \"All I can say is that the gentleman whose history I am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up; be looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly gravedigger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of ours, than anything human. How ghastly pale he is!\" \"Oh, he is always as colourless as you now see him,\" said Franz. \"Then you know him?\" almost screamed the countess. \"Oh! pray do, for Heaven's sake, tell us all about--is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse, or what?\" A few moments later when the lady has carefully studied the loge of their mysterious vis-\u00e0-vis, Franz demands: \"Well, what do you think of our mysterious neighbour?\" \"Why, that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living frame,\" was the reply. This fresh allusion to Byron drew a smile to Franz's countenance; although he could not but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him . . . . . Is it possible,\" whispered Franz, \"that you entertain any fear?\" \"I'll tell you,\" answered the countess. \"Byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires, and even assured me he had seen some. The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us. Oh! it is the exact personification of what I have been led to expect. The coal-black hair, large bright, glittering eyes, in which a wild, unearthly fire seems burning,-the same ghastly paleness!\"[40]\n\nNearly thirty years after Dumas in collaboration with Maquet utilized the theme of Le Vampire for his own drama of the same name which was given at the Ambigu-Comique, 20th December, 1851, and which may conveniently be considered here.\n\nLe Vampire is described as a \"Drame Fantastique en Cinq Actes, en Dix Tableaux\" and there are very many characters in this remarkable play. The principal parts were taken as follows: Lord Ruthwen, M. Arnault; Gilbert de Tiffauges, M. Goujet; Juan Rozo, a Spanish inn-keeper, M. Coquet;\n\np. 298\n\nBotaro, his son-in-law, M. Curcy; Lazare, M. Laurent; Lahenn\u00e9e, M. Thierry; Jarwick, M. Lavergne; the Ghoul, Mme. Lucie Mabire; H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Tiffauges, Mile. Jane Essler; Juana, Mile. Marie Clarisse; Antonia, Mlle. Daroux; Petra, Rozo's daughter, Mile. Helo\u00efse; and the mystic fairy M\u00e9lusine, Mlle. Isabelle Constant. Lazare is a capital character, but the intrusion from Oriental legend of the ghoul cannot be considered happy. On the other hand the appearance of M\u00e9lusine, whose legend was collected about the end of the fourteenth century by Jean d'Arras, is certainly effective and entirely in keeping with the history, since according to Paracelsus she was an occult power, and in folk lore she is often represented as protecting ancient houses--in Belgium she is the guardian of the old family de Gavre,--whilst one of her four sons became King of Brittany.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to do more than give the very briefest outline of the story as Dumas tells it. The play opens with a crowded scene of merrymakers in the patio of Juan Rozo's inn. They are celebrating the nuptials of his daughter with young Botaro, and every room is occupied by his friends. and acquaintance in festive mood. Juana, who is staying at the hostlery seeks for a guide to the castle of Tormenar, which lies at some little distance, for there she is to meet Don Luis de Figuerroa, whom she will wed upon the following day. She has secretly left the convent of Annunciades, where she was a boarder, since her father has other designs for her hand, and accordingly it is necessary that she should meet her betrothed in some lonely spot. But nobody, not even the good-natured Lazare, the servant of the inn, will conduct her to the haunted castle, \"un ch\u00e2teau qui est en ruine, un ch\u00e2teau qui ne loge que des reptiles, et qui n'h\u00e9berge que des fant\u00f4mes.\" However, a numerous company, amongst whom is Gilbert de Tiffauges, arrives at the inn, and these travellers on being told that they cannot be accommodated in spite of the fact that night is falling, incontinently resolve to take up their quarters in Tormenar, so in spite of the warnings about ghosts and goblins, having once well stocked themselves with wine and food they merrily set forth, Gilbert taking charge of Juana who has confided to him her story. However, a mysterious figure, a lady, apparently of rank, who has been staying at the inn watches them as they take\n\np. 299\n\ntheir departure and mutters to herself as she fixes her gaze upon Juana: \"Il te faut deux heures pour aller retrouver ton beau fianc\u00e9. . . . Je l'aurai joint dans trois minutes!\" She is in fact the ghoul, a female vampire, and with the speed of lightning she has gone to destroy the unfortunate Don Luis.\n\nIn the second Act we see the huge Gothic hall of the old castle. A door opens and from an inner chamber the ghoul rushes out exclaiming: \"Il \u00e9tait jeune! Il \u00e9tait beau! . . . Me voil\u00e0, redevenue jeune et belle!\" The voice of Gilbert is now heard, and with the cry, \"\u00c0 l'an prochain, Gilbert.\" she disappears from sight. It will be remarked that in his treatment of the vampire tradition Dumas has adopted the legend that the vampire must year by year rejuvenate his waning forces by absorbing the life of another and sucking from another's veins fresh blood, a detail which although it may recommend itself to, and legitimately be used by, the dramatist and the writer of romances is actually inexact and but rarely to be met with, and only then in folk-lore not of the first value. The travellers, no small party, spread their provisions upon the huge tables in the old hall and laughing at the stories of ghosts and apparitions are soon in convivial mood. The conversation, however, eventually turns on the supernatural and Gilbert tells of his old home in Brittany, where one room in the castle is hung with the tapestry of the Fairy M\u00e9lusine, representing this lady and all her attendants. The story goes that if any of the family sleeps in that room she will descend from the tapestry and reveal his fortune, warning him of danger should such threaten. Another companion who has sojourned in Epirus speaks of the vampires, the women who will attack men and leave them dead and sapless; the men who will attack women to drink their blood. Just as the words are uttered Lord Ruthwen enters and announces himself as a belated traveller, who, finding no room at Rozo's inn down in the village has made his way thither,-he has even taken Lazare into his service. Presently the company disperse to their several rooms to make themselves as comfortable as may be for the night in such difficult circumstances. To his horror Gilbert discovers in the chamber he is to occupy the body of a young man, strangely pale, with a slight wound in the throat. By a letter he finds near upon the body it is plain that this can be none other\n\np. 300\n\nthan the unfortunate Don Luis. At the same moment a piercing cry is heard, and Juana ghostly pale and dying totters from her room. Gilbert rushes to her assistance just in time to see Lord Ruthwen dart out after her as she falls dead at his feet. In a moment he has drawn his sword and strikes Ruthwen to the heart, before he recognizes who it may be. In faltering accents Ruthwen explains that hearing a cry he has gone to the assistance of the lady, and with his last breath he implores Gilbert, who is well-nigh distracted at the unhappy accident, to bear his body to the hillside, where it may be bathed in the earliest rays of the new moon. This Gilbert promises, and in the final tableau we see the body of Lord Ruthwen laid upon the mountain. The moon slowly issues from the clouds, and as its silver light falls upon the corpse it seems as though the eyes opened and the mouth smiled. A moment more and the Vampire leaps to his feet re-vitalized and with fresh energy for some new demoniac enterprise.\n\nIn Act III. we find ourselves in Brittany, about a year later, at the ch\u00e2teau de Tiffauges where H\u00e9l\u00e8ne awaits her brother's return. After an affectionate greeting he confides to her the secret of his love for Antonia a lady of Spalatro in Dalmatia, and she in her turn informs him that she is about to give her hand to the Baron de Marsden. This latter proves to be none other than Lord Ruthwen, who informs Gilbert that he was sore wounded indeed at Tormenar, but that certain kindly shepherds finding him on the mountain side nursed him back to life. Moreover, he explains his change of name by informing them that his elder brother having recently died, he has succeeded to the title and estates. Visiting Tiffauges in the hope of meeting Gilbert once more, he has fallen a victim to the charms of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. The explanation is cleverly contrived, but at the same time Gilbert is hardly convinced; he feels that there is some mysterious and terrible secret lurking in the background. A happy idea strikes him. He will sleep that night in the tapestry chamber of the lady M\u00e9lusine. The scene that follows must have been extraordinarily effective upon the stage. Gilbert is slumbering, and from their places in the tapestry step forth M\u00e9lusine and her court to warn the scion of her house that danger is near. From the framed canvas and the panels descend with stately stride\n\np. 301\n\nthe old barons to tell their descendant of the horror that encompasses him, M\u00e9lusine reveals the secret.\n\n\"Prions, pour qu' \u00e0 Gilbert Dieu tout-puissant inspire Un g\u00e9n\u00e9reux effort.\nRuthwen est un d\u00e9mon, Ruthwen est un vampire; Son amour, c'est la mort!\"\n\n(One cannot but recall the famous scene in Gilbert and Sullivan's Ruddigore with its subtle admixture of beauty, fantasy and humour.)\n\nIn Act IV of Le Vampire we are shown the accomplishment of Ruthwen's designs against H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. Gilbert's frenzied warnings and denunciations are heard with alarm but with unbelief. They whisper that he is a lunatic, and when Ruthwen relates a cunning story of a mischance in Spain which temporarily unsettled Gilbert's reason, a story that seems borne out in every detail by the unhappy brother's horror and despair, the attendants for his own safety seek to restrain their young master. Ruthwen triumphs. But now the ghoul appears and bids him take heed how he seeks Gilbert's life for that is hers, and she will not likely relinquish her prey. Ruthwen defies her and the two vampires part in horrid enmity. Lazare cautions H\u00e9l\u00e8ne that her brother's story is no figment, but it is too late, the vampire seizes his victim and as midnight strikes, he destroys his hapless bride and quaffs his fill from her veins. Too late Gilbert succeeds in forcing an entrance. There is a terrific struggle, and Ruthwen is hurled from the window into the depths of a tremendous valley.\n\nIn the last act we find that in order to escape the pursuit of Ruthwen, who has extricated himself unhurt but filled with designs of even more malignant vengeance, Gilbert has transported Antonia to Circassia. Here, however, we meet the ghoul who, disguising herself under the name of Ziska, obtained admittance to the castle in the quality of an attendant upon Antonia. She informs Gilbert that she alone can save his betrothed from the vampire, and at that moment the ghastly face of Ruthwen is actually seen peering through the window. She demands that he shall relinquish Antonia's hand, and accept her love though it be to death. He refuses to betray Antonia, and at length by a supreme act of renunciation she divulges the secret whereby the Vampire may be annihilated, although this revelation must put an end to her own\n\np. 302\n\nexistence. Ziska explains how Gilbert's sword is to be blessed by a priest with a certain occult formula and if the weapon thus consecrated be driven through the Vampire's heart it will once and for all rid the world of this infernal pest. Yet as she speaks she seems to vanish in flames and they hear her last sad sigh; \"Adieu pour ce monde! Adieu pour l'autre! Adieu pour l'\u00e9ternit\u00e9\"!\n\nThe final scene is a deserted cemetery. \"Tombes, cypr\u00e8s. Fond sombre et fantastique; neige sur la terre; lune rouge au ciel.\" The Vampire lies half in and half out of his grave, grinning hideously. Gilbert is standing near. \"Pour la derni\u00e8re fois, adore Dieu!\" he adjures. \"Non,\" yells the monster. \"Alors, desesp\u00e8re et meurs\"! cries Gilbert and plunges the hallowed sword into the monster's heart. The Vampire falls back into the grave, howling fearfully, and a heavy stone closing him in fast seals him there in the womb of the earth for ever and ever. \"Au nom du Seigneur, Ruthwen, je to scelle dans cette tombe pour l'\u00e9ternit\u00e9\", et Gilbert trace sur la pierre une croix que devient lumineuse. A great aureola fills the sky and. multitudes of rejoicing angels are seen. Among them are H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Juana, smiling in happiest benison, whilst there rises from the earth the body of Ziska, radiant and beautiful, to join the glorious throng among whose immortal ranks she is enrolled by the merits of her great act of renunciation and unselfish love.\n\nThis drama of Dumas is infinitely more elaborate than the play of Nodier, but I am not altogether certain whether it is in some respects so good a work. The first two acts attain a high level; the scene in the tapestry chamber would be most picturesque upon the stage; there are several other telling situations and effective speeches, but as a whole it is too prolix, and we feel that the episode of Antonia in particular is an anti-climax. Nor, as I have remarked before, although material use is made of the character, can one consider the figure of the ghoul entirely in keeping with the rest. Had the level of the opening scenes been maintained we should possess an excellent piece of work. But without concentration and compression that was hardly possible, and here we have the secret of Nodier's success. Although he has an occasional crudity, it may be, which Dumas might not have tolerated, so swift is his action, as is essential to\n\np. 303\n\nmelodrama, so cleverly does he engage the interest of his audience, that we have no time to criticize a roughness here and there, but are rather intent to follow the next turn of the tale.\n\nImmediately upon the furore created by Nodier's Le Vampire at the Porte-Saint-Martin in 1819 vampire plays of every kind from the most luridly sensational to the most farcically ridiculous pressed on to the boards. A contemporary critic cries: \"There is not a theatre in Paris without its Vampire! At the Porte-Saint-Martin we have le Vampire; at the Vaudeville le Vampire again; at the Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s les trois Vampires ou le clair de la lune.\"\n\nJean Larat[41] further mentions a play by Paul F\u00e9val, Le fils Vampire. The version by John Wilson Ross of The Loves of Paris, a romance, published by G. Vickers, 3, Catherine Street, Strand, 1846, is said to be \"Translated from the French of Paul F\u00e9val, author of 'The Vampire,' 'The Loves of the Palais-Royal,' 'The Receipt at Midnight,' 'Stella,' 'The Son of the Devil,' etc., etc.\", but it does not appear whether \"The Vampire\" mentioned here is a play or a romance. Probably it is the latter but no such translation is known.\n\nLe Vampire which was produced at the Vaudeville, 15 June, 1820,[42] is a com\u00e9dic-vaudeville in one act by Scribe and M\u00e9lesville. The scene is laid Hungary, \"une salle d'un chateau gothique,\" and the characters are as follows: Le Comte de Valberg, feld-mar\u00e9chal, M. Guillemin; Adolphe de Valberg, son n\u00e9veu, M. Isambert; le Baron do Lourdorff, M. Fontenay; Saussmann, concierge du chateau, M. Hippolyte; Charles, valet du comte, M. Fichet; un Notaire, M. Justin; Hermance de Mansfred, Madame Rivi\u00e8re; Nancy, sa soeur, Madame Lucie; P\u00e9ters, filleul de Saussmann, Madame Minette; with attendance of domestics and wedding guests. This elegant little piece opens with nuptials of Hermance de Mansfred at the castle of the Baron de Lourdorff, to whom she is betrothed. It appears that she has something trifled with the affections of Adolphe de Valberg, now supposed dead. Her sister, Nancy, acknowledges that she loved Adolphe, but kept silence owing to his courtship of Hermance. Adolphe's uncle, the Count de Valberg, who knows nothing of the two ladies, fearing his nephew is unworthily entangled has had him held in military detention at Temesvar, whence\n\np. 304\n\nhowever he has disappeared. The intrigue of the seventeen scenes, although clearly unravelled in the play, is a little complicated, and it must suffice to relate by an accident Adolphe appears at the castle. Upon being asked his name he answers: \"Lord Ruthwen. An Englishman,\" whereupon he is immediately taken to be a Vampire and the servants are thrown into a state of panic. Eventually he is reconciled to his uncle who recognizes him as the brave young hero by whom his life was saved on a recent battlefield; Nancy's fidelity is rewarded with the hand of the man she loves, and who now realizes that Hermance's heart was never his; so that the curtain falls upon a double wedding.\n\nSeveral Pretty lyrics are interwoven with the dialogue and Nancy's first song, to the air \"De sommeiller, encor ma ch\u00e8re from Fanchon la vielleuse, is as follows:\n\nOui, ces paysans respectables\nNous rapellent le bon vieux temps:\nChez eux on croit encore au diable,\nAux vampires, au revenants;\nOn croit \u00e0 toutes les magies,\nAux amours, aux soins assidus,\nAux grands sorciers, aux grands genies . . .\nBref \u00e0 tout ce qu'on ne voit plus!\n\nLes Trois Vampires, ou le clair de, la lune[43] which was being played at the Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s is a thoroughly amusing farce in one act by Brazier, Gabriel, and Armand. It shows the adventures of a bon bourgeois, M. Gobetout, who has so distracted his brain by reading stories of Vampires and ghosts that when one night he sees in his garden three shadowy figures he is well nigh beside himself with terror as he supposes they can be no other than three vampires infesting his house. A little later he catches sight of his two daughters and their abigail who appear actually to be eating with the mysterious strangers. \"Les vampires qui soupent avec mes filles!\" he groans in accents of despair. However it proves that the supper is very material, cold chicken and a glass of good wine, whilst the rendezvous is of an amorous nature, since the visitors are two young sparks and their valet. So the play ends with a triple marriage. One remark of the worthy M. Gobetout was, it is said, nightly greeted with a hurricane of applause. He was wont to murmur in pensive accents: \"Les vampires\n\np. 305\n\nil nous viennent d'Angleterre . . . C'est encore une gentilesse de ces Messieurs . . . ils nous font de jolis cadeaux!\"\n\nAnother farce, Encore un Vampire, which when produced in 1820 at Paris, met with considerable success, was published as by Emile B. L., and yet another vampire burlesque was contributed by A. Rousseau. Les Etrennes d'un Vampire at a minor theatre was billed as from a manuscript \"trouv\u00e9 au cimiti\u00e8re de P\u00e8re-Lachaise.\"\n\nMore amusing is the work of D\u00e9saugiers who in August, 1820, gave Cadet Buteux, vampire, avec relation v\u00e9ridique du prologue et des trois actes de cet \u00e9pouvantable m\u00e9lodrame \u00e9crit sous la dict\u00e9e de ce passeux du Gros Caillou, par son secretaire, D\u00e9saugiers. When published by Rosa, 1820, this libretto bore the motto: \"Vivent les morts!\"\n\nYet another burlesque published by Martinet, 1820, is Le Vampire, m\u00e9lodrame en trois actes, paroles de Pierre de la Fosse de la rue des Morts.[44] A few verses from this vaudeville may be interesting to quote, particularly as showing the long continued popularity of Nodier's melodrama.\n\nLisant pour un sou d'politique\nPlac' Royale, sur un banc,\nJ'tombe, le tour est diabolique,\nA' point nomm\u00e9, sur l'Drapeau blanc.\n\nJ'prends un billet, non pas pour le parterre,\nCes places sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9es aux amis,\nSans l'secours de l'abb\u00e9 Saint-Pierre,\nAvec treiz sous' j'monte au paradis.\n\nAu dernier bane, paix, qu'chacun s'taise\nA' bas la gueule on crie du premier rang,\nL'rideau s'l\u00e8ve et quoique tr\u00e8s mal \u00e0 l'aise,\nLe croirez-vous, j'vois le P\u00e8re Lachaise,\nDu dernier bane.\n\nThe Vampire is described as \"d'\u00e9chapp\u00e9 de corbillard,\" One sees everywhere\n\nDes fant\u00f4ms, des revenans,\nMettant la t\u00e9te a la fen\u00eatre,\nAfin d'regarder les passans.\n\nThere was even a Polichinel Vampire which when performed at the Circus Maurice in 1822 attracted all who had a mind\n\np. 306\n\nfor a hearty laugh, and a contemporary visitor[45] to Paris merrily wrote that \"Polichinel is the very jolliest fellow in the world.\"[46]\n\nA comic operetta in one act, Le Vampire by Martin Joseph Mengals which was produced at Ghent, 1 March, 1826, deserves no more than passing mention.\n\nJames Robinson Planch\u00e9 speedily adapted Nodier's Le Vampire as The Vampire, or, The Bride of the Isles, and his version with music by Joseph Binns Hart[47] was brought out at the English Opera House, 9th August, 1820, with T. P. Cooke[48] as Ruthven, Earl of Marsden, the Vampire. Owing to his fine acting in the part, and perhaps a little to the scenic effects--the scene is laid in the Caverns of Staffa--the play was given nightly to packed houses. It is interesting to remark that for this piece the celebrated vampire trap was invented. Of this I quote the following simple description: \"A vampire trap consists of two or more flaps, usually india-rubber, through which the sprite can disappear almost instantly, where he falls into a blanket fixed to the under surface of the stage. As with the star trap, this trap is secured against accidents by placing another piece or slide, fitting close beneath when not required, and removed when the prompter's bell gives the signal to make ready.\"\n\nThe following account of the production of The Vampire is given by Planch\u00e9 in his Recollections and Reflections, Chapter III.[49] Having just spoken of an Easter piece with which he had furnished Drury Lane, Abudah, or, The Talisman of Oromanes,[50] founded upon one of the Tales of the Genii[51] and which although it had a run of nine nights Planch\u00e9 calls a very poor piece, \"miserably put on the stage,\" he continues to speak of a subsequent success, and tells us: \"A more fortunate melodrama of mine, \"The Vampire, or The Bride of the Isles,\" was produced at the Lyceum, or English Opera House, as it was then called, 9th August, 1820. Mr. Samuel James Arnold, the proprietor and manager, had placed in my hands, for adaptation, a French melodrama, entitled \"Le Vampire,\" the scene of which was laid, with the usual recklessness of French dramatists, in Scotland, where the superstition never existed. I vainly endeavoured to induce Mr. Arnold to let me change it to some place in the East of Europe. He had set his heart on Scotch music and dresses--\n\np. 307\n\nthe latter, by the way, were in stock--laughed at my scruples, assured me that the public would neither know nor care--and in those days they certainly did not--and therefore there was nothing left for me but to do my best with it. The result was most satisfactory to the management. The situations were novel and effective; the music lively and popular; the cast strong, comprising T. P. Cooke, who made a great hit in the principal character, Harley, Bartley, Pearman, Mrs. Chatterley and Miss Love. The trap now so well known as \"the Vampire trap\" was invented for this piece, and the final disappearance of the Vampire caused quite a sensation. The melodrama had a long run, was often revived, and is to this day a stock piece in the country. I had an opportunity many years afterwards, however, to treat the same subject in a manner much more satisfactory to myself, and, as it happened, in the same theatre, under the same management; but of that anon.\"\n\nThe full cast of The Vampire, or, The Bride of the Isles was originally as follows: \"In the Introductory Vision\"; Unda, Spirit of the Flood, Miss Love; Ariel, Spirit of the Air, Miss Worgman; The Vampire, Mr. T. P. Cooke; Lady Margaret, Mrs. Chatterly. \"In the Drama \": Ruthven, Earl of Marsden, the Vampire, Mr. T. P. Cooke; Ronald, Baron of the Isles, Mr. Bartley; Robert, an English Attendant on the Baron, Mr. Pearman; M'Swill, the Baron's Henchman, Mr. Harley; Andrew, Steward to Ruthven, Mr. Minton; Father Francis, Mr. Shaw; Lady Margaret, Daughter of Ronald, Mrs. Chatterly; Effie, Daughter of Andrew, Miss Carew; Bridget Lord Ronald's Housekeeper, Mrs. Grove. With regard to the costumes of which Planch\u00e9 speaks it is interesting to remark that the principal characters Ruthven and Lady Margaret are described as follows: Ruthven, Silver breast plate, studded with steel buttons; plaid kilt; philibeg; flesh arms and leggings; sandals; Scotch hat and feathers; sword and dagger. Lady Margaret, white satin dress, trimmed with plaid and silver; plaid silk sash; Scotch hat and feather. This is in the true transpontine tradition of Ossianic attire. The play is timed to take one hour and thirty minutes in representation-and Planch\u00e9 has done his work of adaptation very well, although I doubt whether his few slight departures from the original are improvements. Nevertheless he has\n\np. 308\n\ngiven the dialogue a native turn and an ease which were at this period too often lacking in similar versions from the French.\n\nIn 1825, T. P. Cooke visited Paris and appeared as Le Monstre at the Porte-Saint-Martin in Planch\u00e9's melodrama which proved a remarkable success, running for no less than eighty nights.\n\nThe Vampire or The Bride of the Isles has its place among the repertory of Hodgson's \"Juvenile Drama,\" and this in itself is an indication of no small popularity.\n\nIn The Second Maiden's Tragedy,[52] a Globe play of 1611, licensed for the stage by Sir George Buc on 31st October of that year, a macabre drama now generally attributed to Tourneur,[53] there are some remarkable scenes which culminate in something very like necrophilia, and a perverse ill-omened melancholy pervades the whole action. In Act IV the Tyrant, a usurper, ordering soldiers to attend him with \"Lanthornes and a pickax\" makes his way at midnight to the Cathedral, crying:\n\nDeath nor the marble prison my love sleeps in\nShall keep her body lockt up from mine arms.\nI must not be so cozened.\n\nA little later: \"Enter the Tirant agen at a farder dore, which opened, bringes hym to the Toombe wher the Lady lies buried; The Toombe here discouered ritchly set forthe.\" He adjures the sepulchre:\n\nThe house of silence and the Calms of rest\nAfter tempestuous life, I claim of thee\nA mistress one of the most beauteous sleepers\nThat ever lay so cold.\n\nThe vault is forced, whilst the lover soliloquizes:\n\nO the moon rises; what reflection\nIs thrown about the sanctified building,\nE'en in a twinkling, how the monuments glisten\nAs if Death's palaces were all massy silver\nAnd scorned the name of marble. Art thou cold?\nI have no faith in't, yet I believe none.\nMadam; 'tis I, sweet lady, pry'thee speak\n'Tis thy love calls on thee; thy king, thy servant.\nNo! not a word, all prisoners to pale silence\nI'll prove a kiss.\n\np. 309\n\nFirst Soldier:\n\nHere's chill venery!\n'Twould make a pandar's heels ache. I'll be sworn\nAll my teeth chatter in my head to see't.\n\nTyrant:\n\nBy th' mass, thou'rt cold indeed. Beshrew thee for't,\nUnkind to thine own blood? Hard hearted lady,\nWhat injury hast thou offered to the youth\nAnd pleasure of thy days: refuse the Court\nAnd steal to this hard lodging, was that wisdom\n.      .      .      .      Since thy life has left me\nI'll clasp the body for the spirit that dwelt in't,\nAnd love the house still for the mistress' sake.\nThou art mine now spite of destruction\nAnd Govianus; and I will possess thee.\nI once read of a Herod whose affection.\nPursued a virgin's love as I did thine,\nWho for the hate she owed him killed herself\n(As thou too rashly didst), without all pity;\nYet he preserved her body dead in honey,\nAnd kept her long after her funeral:\nBut I'll unlock the treasure house of art\nWith keys of gold and bestow all on thee\nHere slaves receive her humbly from our arms,\n.      .      .      .      So reverently\nBear her before us gently to our palace.\nPlace you the stone again where we first found it.\n\nAfter a while the scene is in the palace: \"They bringe the Body in a Chaire drest up in black veluet which setts out the pailenes of the handes and face, And a faire Chayne of pearle crosse her brest and the Crucyfex aboue it; He standes silent awhile letting the Musique play, beeknyng the soldiers that bringe her in to make obeisaunce to her, and he hym self makes a lowe honour to the body and kisses the hande. A song within in Voyces.\n\nSong:\n\nO what is Beauty that's so much adored\nA flattring glass that cozens her beholders.\nThe Night of Death makes it look pale and horrid\nThe Daynty preseru'd flesh how soone it molders\nTo loue it lyuinge it bewitchett manye\nBut after life is seldom heard of any.\"\n\nTyrant:\n\nHow pleasing art thou to us even in death\nI love thee yet, above all women living\nAnd shall do seven years hence. p. 310\nI can see nothing to be mended in thee\nBut the too constant paleness of thy cheek.\nI'd give the kingdom, but to purchase there\nThe breadth of a red Rose, in natural colour,\nAnd think it the best bargain that ever king made yet,\nBut Fate's my hinderer,\nAnd I must only rest content with Art,\nAnd that I'll have in spite on't.\n\nAccordingly an artist in painting and perfumery is summoned to adorn the face of the corpse and give it a fresh lively red colour. However this merchant of cosmetics is none other than Govianus, the rightful heir, disguised, and he fucuses the dead cheeks and lips with a peter which is confected with a strong poison, so that when the Tyrant lustfully kisses the cold flesh, he is blasted with the venom and falls in the agonies of death. The incident is extremely powerful, if extremely horrible. As the Tyrant expires Govianus taunts him thus\n\nO thou sacrilegious villain,\nThou thief of rest, robber of monuments,\nCannot the body after funeral\nSleep in the grave for thee? Must it be raised?\nOnly to please the wickedness of thine eye?\nDoes all things end with death and not thy lust?\nHast thou devised a new way to damnation,\nMore dreadful than the soul of any sin\nDid ever pass yet between earth and hell?\n\nA very large number of plays are founded upon what may be termed the \"Romeo and Juliet\" motive, the awakening, or the restoration to life in some sort, of a loved one supposed dead, arousing from a trance, it may be, or a coma, a theme admitting almost innumerable variants. In the Italian, French and German theatres alone--nor does this rough list pretend to be exhaustive--we have Sforza d' Oddi's Imorti vivi (1576); Pagnini's Imorti vivi (1600); Rota's La morta viva (1674); Douville's Les morts vivans (1654); Quinault's Le fant\u00f4me amoureux (1659); Boursault's Le Mort vivant (1662); Sedaine's Der Tote ein Freyer (1778); Kurl\u00e4nder's Der tote Neffe; Friedrich Rambach's Der Scheintote; Leopold Huber's Der Scheintote; Theodore Friedrich's Die Scheintoten; F. L. W. Meyer's Der Verstorbene; G. Lebrun's Die Verstorbenen; Tenelli's Der Verstorbene; Holbein's \"romantisches Gem\u00e4lde\" Der Verstorbene; Paers' opera Die lebenden Toten; and a ballet\n\np. 311\n\n(1803) Der lebendige Tote; cum multis aliis quae nunc perscribere longum est.\n\nIt may be convenient here briefly to review the progress of the Vampire in the theatre, at least in his most important appearances.\n\nAn Italian opera, I vampiri, the work of the much applauded Neapolitian composer Silvestro di Palma, which was performed at the Teatro San Carlo[54] in 1800 did not of course take anything from the novel by Polidori which indeed, it preceded by nearly twenty years. but was rather inspired by the famous treatise of Guiseppe Davanzati: Dissertazione sopra i Vampiri di Gioseppe Davanzati Patrizio Fiorentino e Tranese, Cavaliere Gerosolimitano, Arcivescovo di Trani, e Patriarca d'Alessandria. (Seconda edizione.) Nalopi. M.D.CC.LXXXIX. Presso Filippo Raimondi. Con licenzi de' Superiori.\n\nOn 28th March, 1828,[65] at Leipzig, was produced an opera, \"Grosse romantische Oper,\" Der Vampyr, founded on the original French melodrama, the scene being changed from Scotland to Hungary. The libretto is by Wilhelm August Wohlbr\u00fcck and the music by his yet more famous brother-in-law Heinrich August Marschner. Der Vampyr was an enormous success. A free adaptation of this being made by J. R. Planch\u00e9, and produced at the Lyceum, 25th August, 1829, it ran for sixty nights. In his Recollections and Reflections which have before been quoted, Planch\u00e9 commences Chapter X by some account of this. \"In the summer of 1829 I had the opportunity of treating the subject of 'The Vampire' in accordance with my own ideas of propriety. The French melodrama had been converted into an opera for the German stage, and the music composed by Marschner.\n\n\"Mr. Hawes, who had obtained a score of it, having induced Mr. Arnold to produce it at the Lyceum, I was engaged to write the libretto, and consequently laid the scene of action in Hungary, where the superstition exists to this day, substituted for a Scotch chieftain a Wallachian Boyard, and in many other respects improved upon my earlier version. The opera was extremely well sung, and the costumes novel as well as correct, thanks to the kindness of Dr. Walsh, the traveller,[66] who gave me some valuable information respecting the national dresses of the Magyars and the Wallachians.\n\np. 312\n\n\"I am surprised that Marschner's most dramatic and melodious works, 'Der Vampyr,' 'Die Judin,' &c., have not been introduced to our more advanced musical audiences at one or other of our great operatic establishments.\n\n\"The production of 'Der Vampyr' was followed by that of 'The Brigand' at Drury Lane.\"\n\nPolidori's tale formed the basis of a romantic opera in three acts, the libretto of which was from the pen of C. M. Heigel, and the music by p. von Lindpaintner. This was seen at Stuttgart on 2 Ist September, 1828, and it proved a remarkable success. It was announced as being from \"Byron's famous tale,\" although at this date such an attribution can hardly have deceived any.\n\nOn 25th May, 1857, there was produced in Berlin a \"Komischen Zauber-Ballet Morgano\" by Paul Taglioni with music by J. Hertzel. The scene is laid in Hungary during the seventeenth century, and in the sixth tableau Elsa dances an infernal lavolta with the vampires in their haunted castle, but she is rescued by her lover, Retzka, who slays the vampire Morgano with a consecrated poniard. In 1861 at Milan appeared a ballet by Rotta, Il vampiro, with music by Paolo Giorza. Guten Abend Herr Fischer! oder, Der Vampyr is a light vaudeville in one act by G. Belly and G. L\u00f6ffler, with music by W. Telle, which had some success in its day. Ein Vampyr by Ulrich Franks (Ulla Wolf) given at Vienna in 1877 is a farce taken from Scribe.\n\nIn England Dion Boucicault's[57] The Vampire, in three acts was produced at the Princess's Theatre, London, 19th June, 1852, when the author made his first appearance before a metropolitan audience. Of this drama the following criticism, if criticism it may be called, was given by Henry Morley in his \"Journal of a London Playgoer.\" It must be remembered that Morley continually shows himself extremely prejudiced and his censure must not be taken any more seriously than we regard the ill-word of many critics to-day, for example, the shrill petulant piping and the childish miffs of St. John Ervine in the sullens. Under 19th June Morley writes: \"If there be any truth in the old adage, that 'when things are at the worst they must mend,' the bettering of Spectral Melodrama is not distant; for it has reached the extreme point of inanity in the new piece which was produced on\n\np. 313\n\nMonday at the Princess's Theatre, under the attractive title of The Vampire.\n\n\"Its plot is chiefly copied from a piece which some years ago turned the Lyceum into a Chamber of Horrors; but it has been spun out into three parts, facetiously described as 'Three Dramas': the little period of a century has been interposed between each part; and, in order that the outrage on the possible shall be complete, the third part is projected forward into the year that will be 1860! By this ingenious arrangement, the resuscitation of the original Vampire has been enabled to supply the lovers of the revolting at the Princess's with three acts of murder--that is, two consumated, and one attempted; but, as the delicate process of vampirical killing is exactly after the same pattern in each case, the horror is quite worn out before the career of the creature terminates. Nothing but tedious trash remains.\n\n\"To 'an honest ghost' one has no objection; but an animated corpse which goes about in Christian attire, and although never known to eat, or drink, or shake hands, is allowed to sit at good men's feasts; which renews its odious life every hundred years by sucking a young lady's blood, after fascinating her by motions which resemble mesmerism burlesqued; and which, notwithstanding its well-purchased longevity, is capable of being killed during its term in order that it may be revived by moonbeams--such a ghost as this passes all bounds of toleration.\n\n\"The monster of absurdity was personated by its reviver Mr. Boucicault, with due paleness of visage, stealthiness of pace, and solemnity of tone; the scenery, especially a moonlit ridge amidst the heights of Snowdon, was beautiful, and the costumes were prettily diversified; but the dreary repetition of fantastical horror almost exhausted even the patience which a benefit enjoins. Unfortunately, the mischief of such a piece, produced at a respectable theatre, does not end with the weariness of the spectators, who come to shudder and remain to yawn; for it is not only 'beside the purpose of playing,' but directly contravenes it; and though it may be too dull to pervert the tastes of those who witness its vapid extravagances, it has power to bring discredit on the most genial of arts.\"\n\nIt may be pointed out that this account, probably through ignorance, possibly of intent, is deliberately inaccurate. p. 314 Although confessedly a poorer play than Planch\u00e9's The Vampire Dion Boucicault's drama is not derived from the earlier piece, but both are taken from the same source, Polidori's romance. Seeing that Henry Morley was Emeritus Professor of English Literature in University College, London, it were reasonable to suppose that he should have been acquainted with Polidori's novella. Or perhaps I rather ought to say that therefor it was not to be expected he should have known of this famous work.\n\nBoucicault afterwards revived The Vampire as The Phantom, and this was given in London with good applause. The American cast of the characters of The Phantom, \"As Produced at Wallack's Theatre, New York City,\" is as follows: In Act I (1645), The Phantom, Dion Boucicault; Lord Albert Clavering, Mr. J. B. Howe; Sir Hugh Neville of Graystock, Mr. Ralton; Sir Guy Musgrave, Mr. Etynge; Ralph Gwynne, Mr. Levere; Davy, Mr. T. B. Johnstone; Lucy Peveryl, Miss Agnes Robertson; Ellen, Miss Alleyne; Maud, Miss Ada Clare; Janet, Mrs. H. P. Grattan. In Act II (1750), Alan Raby, Dion Boucicault; Colonel Raby, Mr. Ralton; Edgar, his nephew, Mr. J. B. Howe; Dr. Rees, Mr. Burnett; Curate, Mr. Paul; Corporal Stump, Mr. Peters; Ada Raby, Miss Agnes Robertson; Jenny, Mrs. L. H. Allen.\n\nSubsequently, I presume when The Phantom was given in London, some modifications were made which seem to me most decidedly to be improvements. The first act was placed in the latter part of the reign of Charles II, and two hundred years were supposed to elapse between the first and the second acts. This necessitated trifling changes in the dialogue at certain points; and naturally a complete alteration of costume to a modern style for Act II. In fact the script of the play which is printed in Dicks' Standard Plays, No. 697, (c. 1887) under \"Costume\" gives the following direction\": \"The costumes in the First Act are of the period of the latter part of the reign of Charles the Second. In the Second Art the respective characters are dressed in the provincial costume of Wales at the middle of the present century, The following description of Alan Raby's costume for each act will show the necessity of a complete change in the style of dress which this drama requires.\n\nAlan Raby.--First Act: A Puritan's suit of black serge, bound with black velvet---cloak and breeches to match-black\n\np. 315\n\nbelt and buckle-black gauntlets---shirt collar thrown back so as to show the throat bare-black stockings-black velvet shoes with strap across the instep--black sugar-loaf hat and broad riband and steel buckle--phosphoric livid countenance--slightly bald head--long black lank hair combed behind the ears--bushy black eyebrows and heavy black moustache. 2nd dress: Black dress coat and overcoat of the same colour--black trousers--black waistcoat--black kid gloves, white wristbands over them--white cravat and black German hat--all modern, and such as would be worn by a gentleman at the present time.\" In the theatre such a contrast would have proved very effective.\n\nI notice that Boucicault has in certain scenes borrowed his situations pretty freely from Le Vampire of Dumas, and occasionally he has even conveyed actual dialogue from the French play.\n\nAt the commencement of The Phantom we are shown a room in a Welsh inn, and it appears that Davy and Janet the hostess have just been married. A sudden storm sends Lucy Peveryl thither for shelter, and she confides to Janet that she is on her way to meet at sundown her cousin Roland Peveryl, who is a fugitive and proscribed. On this account he dare not openly seek her hand, but the lovers are secretly betrothed. He has promised to meet her, in order to bid her farewell for a time, in the most unfrequented spot, the ruins of Raby Castle. No sooner does Janet hear that name than she cries out with horror, and speaks of a fearful story connected with the place. They are interrupted by the arrival of Lord Clavering with a party of guests, amongst whom are friends of Lucy. She frankly informs them of her rendezvous, and they decide to accompany her, more especially as the inn has not sufficient accommodation for the travellers, who resolve to take provisions and wine and spend the night in the deserted chambers of the old castle. Davy endeavours to prevent them, nor are his efforts altogether selfish. He tells them: \"No one ever sought a night's shelter in the ruins of Raby Castle, that ever lived to see the morning. . . . Within the ruins of Raby dwells some terrible thing--man or fiend! . . . No traveller that knows the road will ever venture near that spot after nightfall; but strange wayfarers, benighted in the storm have wandered to this place of shelter, and the next morning they are found--dead--each with a wound in his throat in the right side, from which they\n\np. 316\n\nhave evidently bled to death;--but no blood is spilt around, the face is white and fixed, as if it had died of horror.\" \"And he, my betrothed,\" cries Lucy, \"Roland is there.\" Nevertheless the company laugh at these old stories and determine to make their way to the old castle. This they actually find in far better state than they have been led to expect, and their servants who have insisted upon Davy showing them the way soon get a very fair supper from the provisions they have purchased at his inn. Roland Peveryl is not to be found, but whilst they are eating a stranger enters, a Puritan, and announces himself as Gervase Rookwood, a traveller who has lost his way in the mountains. Davy, however, almost collapses with terror. He recollects that many years before the castle belonged to Sir Owen Raby, a noble cavalier, while Alan Raby, his younger brother had joined the forces of Cromwell. Taking advantage of this difference the traitor one midnight with a band of Puritan soldiers surprises the castle, and butchers the sleeping garrison, killing his brother with his own hand. About a year later, however, the tables are turned, the Royalists recapture the place, Alan Raby is seized, and in their rage they hurl the fratricide from a window which hung shudderingly over a fearful precipice. Curiously enough no trace of the body could ever be recovered. But Davy recognizes that Gervase Rookwood is none other than Alan Raby. Here we have the old belief that a man guilty of some, monstrous crime, in this case rebellion against the King and the murder of a brother, is compelled to return as a vampire. When the company disperse to their various apartments for the night Lord Clavering is horrified to discover in his room the dead body of young Roland Peveryl, \"a wound deep in his throat, but bloodless.\" At the same moment a piercing scream is heard and Lucy Peveryl rushing from her chamber with her hands wildly clasping her neck falls dead in Lord Clavering's arms. Seeing as he thinks a shadowy form that steals from her room he draws a pistol and fires. When the company hurry in with lights they discover Alan Raby has been shot. In faltering accents the dying man explains that hearing a cry for help he hastened to the lady's assistance. He will only forgive Lord Clavering on one condition. \"When I have breathed my last, let my body be conveyed amongst the peaks of Snowdon, and there exposed to the first rays of the rising\n\np. 317\n\nmoon which touch the earth.\" This is done, and the first act concludes with a tableau of the peaks of Snowdon, whilst from behind the clouds there sails high in the heaven a silver sickle that strikes the corpse with her argent shaft of mystic light. The vampire wakes, and leaps to his feet crying in exultant tones: \"Fountain of my life: once more thy rays restore me. Death! I defy thee!\"\n\nIt cannot escape notice that in this act there are many parallels with Le Vampire of Dumas. Raby Castle is the Castle of Tormenar; Lucy Peveryl is Juana; Roland Peveryl, Don Luis de Figuerroa; Lord Clavering, Gilbert de Tiffauges; and Davy the gracioso Lazare.\n\nTwo centuries have flown. Raby Castle is now inhabited in possession of Colonel Raby, whose daughter is betrothed to her cousin Edgar. It has been falsely reported that this latter fell in battle, but the scene opens with his return. When the sad news first arrived Ada Raby was stricken almost to death, and, as they believed, actually died; but she was recalled to life by a mysterious stranger, since which hour she seems to, have fallen completely under his influence and in some extraordinary way only to respond to his power. This is none other than Gervase Rookwood, who now appears and informs Colonel Raby that he and none other is the lawful lord of Raby Castle. The Colonel's claim lies in the fact that when years before the last of the old Raby family, Sir Alan Raby died, or rather was killed, and no will could be found, the estate reverted to a distant branch of the Rabys, now represented by the Colonel. However, a document is produced in the handwriting of Alan Raby, his will, wherein he bequeaths the estate to Gervase Rookwood and the Rookwood successors. It seemed as though such a title cannot be resisted, but Doctor Rees, a scholar of occultism, is filled with the gravest suspicions of the stranger. In a \"Dictionary of Necromancy, a rare work by Dr. Dee,\" he has read of vampires, and he divines the demoniac nature of the pretended Rookwood. In a trancelike state Ada Raby has rejected Edgar and is to be given to the stranger, when Dr. Rees examining the documents discovers that the will of Sir Alan Raby, which must be some two hundred years old, although the hand is doubtless that of Raby as the archives prove, is written upon paper which has a watermark of 1850, \"scarcely five years old.\" The vampire who\n\np. 318\n\nendeavours to assassinate Edgar, is killed by a charmed bullet. Whilst his limbs relax in death the hypnotic spell vanishes from Ada's mind and she is united to her lover. But to their horror they notice that as the moonlight touches the body of Alan Raby where he has fallen, his members begin to twitch anew with life. Dr. Rees seizes the vampire and hurls the body into the darkest chasm of the mountain side, where no beam nor ray can ever penetrate or find the smallest chink of entrance.\n\nThe Phantom is, of course, somewhat old-fashioned and a little stilted, as was the mode, in its diction. No doubt some of the situations could be revised and far more neatly turned, yet on the whole I conceive that it should prove of its kind excellent fare in the theatre, and some scenes, at least, in capable hands were not without emotional appeal, I had almost said a certain impressiveness. Far worse dramas have (not undeservedly) earned their meed of approbation and applause.\n\nOn 15th August, 1872, was advertised: \"Royal Strand Theatre. Production of a Bit of Moonshine in Three Rays, entitled 'The Vampire,' written by R. Reece.\" There was indeed a bounteous bill of fare. At seven was given a farce, The Married Bachelor; at 7.30 Byron's Not Such a Fool as He Looks; \"At Half Past Nine the new and original Burlesque, a little Bit of Moonshine in Three Rays, called The Vampire, written by R. Reece. The new Music by John Fitzgerald, the New Scenery Painted by H. P. Hall; Dresses by May, Mrs. Richardson and Assistants; Machinery by Wood; Properties by Ball. The Piece produced under the direction of Mrs. Swanborough, Mr. J. Wallace, and Mr. Reece.\" The house, says the Era, 18th August, 1872, was crowded for this \"satirical burlesque.\" His play, the author wrote, was founded upon \"a German legend, Lord Byron's story, and a Boucicaultian drama.\" The Vampire, according to Reece, is a plagiarist who lives on other people's brains. The title r\u00f4le was acted by Edward Terry who kept the audience in roars of laughter. \"Mr. Terry's make-up as the Vampire was something extraordinary, and he worked with unflagging energy to add 'go' to the novelty.\" During a picnic in the ruins of Raby Castle the Vampire endeavours to steal the note books of Ada Raby (Miss Emily Pitt) and Lady Audley Moonstone (Mrs. Raymond) two lady novelists, so that he may utilize their efforts for his weekly instalment of the \"penny dreadful\" and other fiction.\n\np. 319\n\nHe is attacked by the two lovers of the ladies, Lord Albert Clavering (Miss Bella Goodall) and Edgar (Miss Topsy Venn), and a good deal of broadest farce follows. \"The author was cordially greeted upon his appearance before the curtain, and the latest Strand burlesque may be noted as an undoubted success.\" The Illustrated London News, 24th August, 1872, although very justly doubting the propriety of the subject as a theme for travesty highly praised Edward. Terry \"as the Hibernian plagiarist with the broadest of brogues and the most ghastly of faces.\" As Allan Raby he haunts the ruins of Raby Castle, Raby Hall, and the Peak of Snowdon, seeking to filch the notebooks of tourists, \"from which he may gather materials for a three-volume novel which he has been engaged by a publisher to compose.\"\n\nOn Monday, 27th September, 1909, at the Paragon Theatre was produced The Vampire, a \"two-scene sketch,\" adapted by Mr. Jos\u00e9 G. Levy from the French of Mme. C. le Vylars and Pierre Souvestre. \"It is a capitally written little piece conceived. in the grand Guignol vein;\" The Stage, 30th September, 1909. The first scene is Harry le Strang's smoking-room. Harry has been infatuated with a demi-mondaine named Sonia, who shot herself in a fit of remorse. The despairing lover is in communication with a Hindoo spiritualist Seratsih, who has evoked the spirit of the dead woman, now become a vampire and preying upon Harry's vitality and reason. An old friend, Jack Harlinger, in order as he thinks to save the situation persuades his own fianc\u00e9e, Olga Kay, to personate the ghost of Sonia. The result is swift tragedy, for the maddened Harry le Strang shoots her dead destroying the vampire, whilst he himself falls at the revolver of Jack Harlingen Harry le Strang was played by Charles Hanbury; Jack Harlinger, Lauderdale Maitland; Seratsih, Clinton Barrett; and Olga Kay, Janet Alexander. The piece was very well received.\n\nThe Vampire, a Tragedy in Five Acts, by St. John Dorset (the Rev. Hugo John Belfour), Second Edition, 1821,[60] does not appear to have been acted. It was dedicated to W. G. Macready, Esq., whose kindness the author acknowledges in most grateful terms. The story is Oriental, the same being laid in Alexandria, and it is a \"moral\" vampire that is shown by the poet. In his \"advertisement\" he quotes a passage\n\np. 320\n\nfrom the Examiner, when noticing Planch\u00e9's melodrama wrote: \"There are Vampires who waste the heart and happiness of those they are connected with, Vampires of avarice, Vampires of spleen, Vampires of debauchery, Vampires in all the shapes of selfishness and domestic tyranny.\" This is his theme, and although his pages have considerable merit I do not conceive that his scenes would have been entirely successful on the stage, since they are poetical and reflective rather than dramatic,\n\nIn Germany sensational fiction was long largely influenced by Polidori, and we have such romances as Zschokke's Der tote Gast, Spindler's Der Vampyr und seine Braut, Theodor Hildebrand's Der Vampyr, oder die Totenbraut. Edwin Bauer's roman \u00e0 clef the clever Der Baron Vampyr,\" which was published at Leipzig in 1846, hardly concerns as here, whilst Ewald August K\u00f6nig's sensational Ein moderner Vampyr,[62] which appeared in 1883, or Franz Hirsch's Moderne Vampyr,[63] 1873, productions which only use in their titles the word \"Vampire\" to attract,--one might say, to ensnare attention, are in this connexion no more deserving of consideration than mere chap-books and pedlar's penny-ware such as Morelli's Der Vampyr, and Dr. Seltzam's pornographic Die Vampyre der Residenz.\n\nUndoubtedly the vampire tradition has never been treated with such consummate skill as by Th\u00e9ophile Gautier in his exquisite prose poem La Morte Amoureuse, which first appeared in the Chronique de Paris on 23rd and 26th June, 1836, when the young author was not quite twenty-five. Although the theme is not original yet perhaps nowhere beside has it been so ingeniously moulded with such delicacy of style, with such rich and vivid colouring, with such emotion and such repression. The darker shadows of the tradition are suggested rather than portrayed, yet none can deny that there is an atmosphere of sombre mystery, even a touch of morbid horror which with complete artistry the writer allows us to suspect rather than to comprehend. The very vagueness of the relation adds to the illusion. We hardly know whether Romuald is the young country priest occupied in prayer and good works, or whether he is the Renaissance seignior living a life of passion and hot extravagance. As he himself cries: \"Sometimes I thought I was a priest who dreamed every night that be was a nobleman, sometimes that I was a nobleman who dreamed that he was a\n\np. 321\n\npriest. I could no longer distinguish dreams from real life; I did not know where reality began and illusion ended. The dissolute, supercilious young lord jeered at the priest, and the priest abhorred the dissipations of the young lord.\" But were he humble priest, or were he profligate patrician, one emotion remained eternally the same, his love for Clarimonde. At length the Abb\u00e9 Serapion dissolves the glamour. Sternly he bids young Romuald accompany him to the deserted cemetery where Clarimonde lies buried; he exhumes the body, and as he sprinkles it with holy water it crumbles into dust. Then also has the lord Romuald gone for ever. There only remains the poor priest of God broken and alone, who grows old in an obscure parish in the depths of a wood, and who well-nigh half a century after scarcely dares to stir the ashes of that memory.\n\nThere are in English not a few stories which deal with the vampire tradition, and many of these are well imagined and cleverly contrived; the morbid horror of the thing has often been conveyed with considerable power, but yet it will, I think, be universally allowed that no author has written pages comparable to this story of Gautier. It is hardly to be disputed that the best of the English vampire stories is Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla, which the authorities upon the bibliography of this author[64] have not traced further back than its appearance in the collection entitled In A Glass Darkly, 1872,[65] Carmilla which is a story of some length, containing sixteen chapters, is exceedingly well told and it certainly exhibits that note of haunting dread which is peculiar to Le Fanu's work. The castle in Styria and the family who inhabit it are excellently done, nor will the arrival of Carmilla and the mysterious coach wherein sat \"a hideous black woman, with a sort of coloured turban on her head, who was gazing all the time from the carriage window, nodding and grinning derisively towards the ladies, with gleaming eyes and large white eyeballs, and her teeth set as if in fury,\" easily be forgotten.\n\nIt must suffice to mention very briefly but a few short stories in English where the vampire element is present. E. F. Benson has evoked real horror in his The Boom in the Tower and the horrible creature tangled in her rotting shroud all foul with mould and damp who returns from her accursed grave is loathly to the last degree.\n\np. 322\n\nThe Flowering of the Strange Orchid, by H. G. Wells, introduces a botanical vampire. An orchid collector is found dead in a jungle in the Andaman Islands, with a strange bulb lying near him. This is brought to England and carefully tended by a botanist until it comes to flower. But when at last the blossoms burst open great tendrils suddenly reach out to grasp the man sucking his blood with hideous gusts. The unfortunate wretch has to be violently torn away from the plant which drips with blood scare e in time to save his life.\n\nThis idea closely resembles Fred M. White's story, The Purple Terror, which appeared in the Strand Magazine, September, 1899, Vol. xviii, No. 105. Here Lieutenant Will Scarlett, an American officer and a number of his men have to make their way across a certain tract of Cuban Territory. Spending the night in a country posada they are attracted by a pretty dancing girl who is wearing twined round her shoulders a garland of purple orchids larger than any known variety. The blossoms which a blood-red centre exhale a strange exotic perfume. Scarlett is fired with the enthusiasm of giving a new orchid to the horticultural world, and on the following morning a native, named Tito, undertakes to guide him to the spot. He learns that the natives call them \"the devil's poppies\" and that the flowers grow in the high trees where their blossoms cling to long green tendrils. As night falls the little company arrives at a plateau ringed by tall trees whose branches are crowned with great wreaths of the purple flower nestling amid coils of long green ropery. To their alarm they note that the ground is covered with bleaching bones, the skeletons of men, animals, and birds alike. Yet perforce they must camp there rather than risk the miasma of the lower valley. Scarlett keeps watch. In the darkness there is a rustling sound and suddenly a long green tendril furnished at the end with a sucker armed with sharp spines like teeth descends and snatches one of the men from the ground. As it is about to withdraw Scarlett with inconceivable swiftness slashes it through with his knife. But the man's clothing has even in that moment been cut through by the razor spines and his body is marked by a number of punctures where his blood is oozing in great drops. Immediately half-a-dozen and more lithe living cords with fanged mouths fall groping for their prey. The men are hurriedly awakened and with\n\np. 323\n\ndifficulty they extricate themselves by sending their whingers, ripping and tearing in every direction. It appears that the vampire poppies at night send down these tendrils to gather moisture. Anything which the fearful suckers can catch they drain dry, be it man or beast or bird. Lieutenant Scarlett and his men have been deliberately led into this trap by Tito, who is madly jealous of their compliments to Zara, the dancing-girl. They hold him prisoner and threaten him with condign punishment at headquarters.\n\nAlgernon Blackwood brings together two types of vampires in his story The Transfer. One is a human being, the psychic sponge, who absorbs and seems to live upon the vitality of others. He is thus described by the governess: \"I watched his hard, bleak face; I noticed how thin he was, and the curious oily brightness of his steady eyes. And everything he said or did announced what I may dare to call the suction of his presence.\" There is also a yet more horrible monster, if one may term it so, the Forbidden Corner, an arid barren spot in the midst of the rose garden, naked and bald amid luxuriant growth. A child who knows its evil secret says: \"It's bad. It's hungry. It's dying because it can't get the food it wants. But I know what would make it feel right.\" When the human vampire ventures near this spot it exerts its secret strength and draws him to itself. He falls into the middle of the patch and it drinks his energy. He lives on, but he seems to be nothing more than a physical husk or shell without vitality. As for the Forbidden Corner \"it lay untouched, full of great, luscious, driving weeds and creepers, very strong, full fed and bursting thick with life.\"\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle in his little story, The Parasite, has depicted a human vampire or psychic sponge in the person of Miss Penelosa, who is described as being a small frail creature, \"with a pale peaky face, an insignificant presence and retiring manner.\" Nevertheless she is able to obsess Professor Gilroy who says: \"She has a parasite soul, yes, she is a parasite; a monster parasite. She creeps into my form as the hermit crab creeps into the whelk's shell.\" To his horror he realizes that under her influence his will becomes weaker and weaker and he is bound to seek her presence. He resists for a while, but the force becomes so overmastering that he is compelled to yield, loathing himself as he does so. When he visits her,\n\np. 324\n\nwith a terrific effort he breaks the spell and denounces her unhallowed fascination in burning words. However, his victory is short indeed. She persecutes him most bitterly, and when he unburdens his troubles to his college professor the only result is a prescription of chloral and bromide, which promptly goes into the gutter. With devilish craft the vampire destroys his reputation as a scholar, and brings about ill-natured gossip and comment. She is able to confuse his brain during his lectures, so that he talks unintelligible nonsense and his classes become the laughing-stock of the university, until at length the authorities are obliged to suspend him from his position. Almost in despair he cries: \"And the most dreadful part of it all is my loneliness. Here I sit in a commonplace English bow-window looking out upon a common-place English street, with its garish buses and its lounging policemen, and behind me there hangs a shadow which is out of all keeping with the age and place. In the home of knowledge I am weighed down and tortured by a power of which science knows nothing. No magistrate would listen to me. No paper would discuss my case. No doctor would believe my symptoms. My own most intimate friends would only look upon it as a sign of brain derangement. I am out of all touch with my kind.\"\n\nThe unfortunate victim is driven even deeper still by this unhallowed influence, which causes him to rob a bank, violently assault a friend, and finally to come within an ace of mutilating the features of his betrothed. At length the persecution ceases with the sudden death of the vampire, Miss Penelosa.\n\nThe True Story of a Vampire is a pathetic little story, very exquisitely told, in Studies of Death, by Stanislaus Eric, Count Stenbock, who wrote some verses of extraordinary charm in Love, Sleep, and Dreams; Myrtle, Rue, and Cypress; The Shadow of Death; and who at least once in The Other Side told a macabre legend with most powerful and haunting effect. A mysterious Count Vardaleh visits the remote styrian castle of old Baron Wronski, and before long attains an occult influence over the boy heir, Gabriel. The lad wastes away, and Count Vardaleh is heard to murmur: \"My darling, I fain would spare thee; but thy life is my life, and I must live, I who would rather die. Will God not have any mercy on me? Oh, oh! life; oh, the torture of life! . . . O Gabriel, my beloved! My life, yes, life--oh, my life? I am sure this is\n\np. 325\n\nbut a little I demand of thee. Surely the superabundance of life can spare a little to one who is already dead.\" As the boy lies wan and ill, the Count enters the room and presses a long feverish kiss upon his lips. Vardaleh rushes forth, and can never be traced again. Gabriel has expired in the agony of that embrace.\n\nIn a novel, The Vampire, by Reginald Hodder, a woman who is the leader of an occult society is forced to exercise her powers as a vampire to prevent the ebbing of her vitality. Here her ravages are psychic rather than physical, albeit in fact the two so closely commingled that they are not to be separated. A curious feature in the tale is that this woman is represented as putting forth her energies through the medium of a metallic talisman, and various struggles to gain possession of the object form the theme of the story. It falls into the hands of persons who would employ it for evil purposes, when it constitutes a very formidable menace, but at the last after a number of extraordinary happenings it is happily recovered.\n\nThe traditional, but yet more horrible vampire is presented to us by F. Marion Crawford in For the Blood Is the Life. Here a young man, who has been loved by a girl whose affection he was unable to return, is after her death vampirised by her, and when his friends suspect the truth they determine to rescue him. They find him upon her grave, a thin stream of blood trickling from his throat. \"And the flickering light of the lantern played upon another face that looked up from the feast,--upon two deep, dead eyes that saw in spite of death--upon parted lips redder than life itself--upon gleaming teeth on which glistened a rosy drop.\" The situation is effectively dealt with according to the good old tradition. A hawthorn stake is driven through the heart of the vampire who emits a quantity of blood and with a despairing shriek dies the last death.\n\nAlmost equally vivid in its details must be accounted the tale, Four Wooden Stakes, by Victor Roman. The ghastly events in the lonely old house with its little grey crypt, some ten miles from the small town of Charing, a place of not more than fifteen hundred souls, are most vividly described. There lived the Holroyds, the grandfather, the father, and three brothers. Whilst in South America the grandfather \"was\n\np. 326\n\nattacked while asleep by one of those huge bats. Next morning he was so weak be couldn't walk. That awful thing had sucked his life blood away. He arrived here, but was sickly until his death, a few weeks later.\" So says Remson Holroyd, who is left the sole survivor of the family, and who has summoned his old college friend to help him solve the secret of the hideous doom which is taking toll one by one. The grandfather was not buried in the usual way; but, as his will directed, his remains were interred in the vault built near the house. Remson Holroyd continues: \"Then my dad began failing and just pined away until he died. What puzzled the doctors was the fact that right up until the end he consumed enough food to sustain three men, yet he was so weak he lacked the strength to drag his legs over the floor. He was buried, or rather interred with grand-dad. The same symptoms were in evidence in the cases of George and Fred. They are both lying in the vault. And now, Jack, I'm going, too, for of late my appetite has increased to alarming proportions, yet I am as weak as a kitten.\" The next morning the visitor finds himself so weak that he is hardly able to rise and he feels a slight pain in the neck. \"I rushed to examine it in the mirror. Two tiny dots rimmed with blood--my blood--and on my neck! No longer did I chuckle at Remson's fears, for it, the thing, had attacked me--as I slept.\" The host himself is in a state of utter exhaustion. That night watch is kept by the friend, and as from his concealment he is gazing into Remson's room he notices \"a faint reddish glow outside one of the windows. It apparently emanated from nowhere. Hundreds of little specks danced and whirled in the spot of light, and as I watched them fascinated, they seemed to take oil the form of a human face. The features were masculine, as was also the arrangement of the hair. Then the mysterious glow disappeared.\" After a few moments there appears a vague form of which the watcher is able to distinguish the head, and to his horror he sees that the features are the same as those of a portrait of the grandfather which is hanging in the picture gallery of the house. \"But oh, the difference in expression! The lips were drawn back in a snarl, disclosing two sets of pearly white teeth, the canines over developed and remarkably sharp. The eyes, an emerald green in colour, stared in a look of consuming hate.\" The horror is revealed. The house is infested by a vampire. In the morning\n\np. 327\n\nthe two friends visit the vault. \"As if by mutual understanding, we both turned toward the coffin on our left. It belonged to the grandfather. We unplaced the lid, and there lay the old Holroyd. He appeared to be sleeping; his face was full of colour, and he had none of the stiffness of death. The hair was matted, the moustache untrimmed, and on the beard were matted stains of a dull brownish hue. But it was his eyes that attracted me. They were greenish, and they glowed with an expression of fiendish malevolence such as I had never seen before. The look of baffled rage on the face might well have adorned the features of the devil in hell.\" They drive a stake through the living corpse, which shrieks and writhes, whilst the gushing blood drenches coffins and floor spurting out in great jets over the very walls. The head is severed from the body, and as the final stroke of the knife cut the connexion a scream issued from the mouth; and the whole corpse fell away into dust, leaving nothing but a wooden stake lying in a bed of bones.\" The remaining three bodies are treated in the same way, and thus the thrall of the curse is lifted from the old house, ten miles from the little town of Charing.\n\nAlthough the genius of Charles Baudelaire, when his art required it, shrank from no extremity of physical horror, yet in his exquisite poem Le Vampire he has rather portrayed the darkness and desolation of the soul:\n\nToi qui, comme un coup de couteau,\nDans mon coeur plaintif est entr\u00e9e;\nToi qui, forte comme un troupeau\nDe d\u00e9mons, vins, folle et par\u00e9e.\n\nDe mon esprit humili\u00e9\nFaire ton lit et ton domaine\n--Inf\u00e2me a qui je suis li\u00e9\nComme le forcat a la cha\u00eene,\n\nComme au jeu le joueur t\u00eatu,\nComme \u00e0 la bouteille l'ivrogne,\nComme aux vermines la charogne,\n--Maudite, maudite sois-tu!\n\nJ'ai pri\u00e9 le glaive rapide\nDe conquerir ma libert\u00e9\nEt j'ai dit au poison perfide\nDe secourir ma l\u00e2chet\u00e9.\n\np. 328\n\nHelas! le poison et le glaive\nM'ont pris en d\u00e9dain et m'ont dit\nTu n'es pas digne qu'on t'enl\u00e8ve\nA ton esclavage maudit.\n\nImb\u00e9cile!--de son empire\nSi nos efforts te d\u00e9livraient,\nTes baisers ressusciteraient\nLe cadavre de ton vampire!\n\nIn England there is a poem--truly of a very different kind--which appears in the life of the famous scientist, James Clerk Maxwell, by Lewis Campbell and William Garnett, verses written by Maxwell in 1845 when he was fourteen Years of age. The verses should not perhaps, because of the youth of the author, be criticized too sharply, and although they show Wardour Street fustian and gimcrack, since the piece is of no great length it may pardonably be quoted here. It is not entirely without a certain feeling after the right atmosphere, and much will be forgiven on account of the precocity. It is grandiosely entitled The Vampyre: Compylt into Meeter by James Clerk Maxwell.\"\n\nThair is a knichte rydis through the wood,\nAnd a douchty knichte is hee.\nAnd sure bee is on a message sent,\nHe rydis sae hastilie.\nHe passit the aik, and hee passit the birk,\nAnd bee passit monie a tre,\nBot plesant to him was the saugh sae slim,\nFor beneath it hee did see\nThe boniest ladye that ever hee saw,\nScho was sae schyn and fair.\nAnd thair scho sat, beneath the saugh,\nKaiming hir gowden hair.\nAnd then the knichte--\"Oh ladye brichte,\nWhat chance has broucht you here?\nBut sae the word, and ye schall gang\nBack to your kindred dear,\"\nThen up and spok the ladye fair--\n\"I have nae friends or kin,\nBot in a little boat I live,\nAmidst the waves' loud din.\"\nThen answered thus the douchty knichte\"\nI'll follow you through all,\nFor gin ye bee in a littel boat,\nThe world to it seemis small.\" p. 329\nThey goed through the wood, and through the wood,\nTo the end of the wood they came:\nAnd when they came to the end of the wood\nThey saw the salt sea faem.\nAnd when they saw the wee, wee boat,\nThat daunced on the top of the wave,\nAnd first got in the ladye fair,\nAnd then the knichte sae brave.\nThey got into the wee, wee boat\nAnd rowed wi' a' their micht\nWhen the knichte sae brave, he turnit about,\nAnd lookit at the ladye bricht\nHe lookit at her bonnie cheik,\nAnd bee lookit at hir twa bricht eyne,\nBot hir rosie cheik growe ghaistly pale,\nAnd schoe seymit as scho deid had been.\nThe fause, fause knichte growe pale with frichte.\nAnd his hair rose up on end,\nFor gane-by days cam to his mynde,\nAnd his former love he kenned.\nThen spake the ladye--\"Thou, fause knichte,\nHast done to me much ill,\nFor didst forsake me long ago,\nBot I am constant still:\nFor though I ligg in the woods sae cald,\nAt rest I canna bee\nUntil I sucks the gude lyfe blude\nOf the man that gart me dee.\"\nHee saw hir lipps were wet wi' blude,\nAnd hee saw hir lufolesse eyne,\nAnd loud bee cry'd, \"get frae my syde,\nThou vampyr corps encleane!\"\nBut no, bee is in hir magic boat,\nAnd on the wyde, wyde sea;\nAnd the vampyr suckis his gude lyfe blude,\nSho suckis him till hee dee.\nSo now beware, whoe'er you are,\nThat walkis in this lone wood:\nBeware of that deceitfull spright,\nThe ghaist that suckis the blude.\n\nThe Vampire Bride, a ballad by the Hon. Henry Liddell, has considerable merit, It may be found in The Wizard of the North, The Vampire Bride, and other Poems, Blackwood, Edinburgh, and Cadell, London, 1833. These stanzas are founded upon the old tale of the knight who having placed a ring--some say his wedding-ring--around the finger of the statue of Venus whilst he is a quoiting, when he would reclaim it\n\np. 330\n\nfinds that the finger is crooked so that the jewel may not be withdrawn, whilst that night a phantom claims him as her spouse. With difficulty is he freed from the thrall of the succubus.\n\nIn 1845 there was published at the Columbian Press Weston-super-mare, a little book entitled The Last of the Vampires, by Smyth Upton. The chief, some critics might say the only, merit of this tale is its excessive rarity. The narrative is somewhat curiously divided into Epochs, the first of which takes place in 1769, the second in 1777, the third and last in 1780. Chapter I opens in an English village named Frampton, but in Chapter II \"we find ourselves upon the borders of Bohemia\" in the Castle Von Oberfels. Four chapters of no great length and somewhat disconnected in their sequence comprise the First Epoch. A little later we meet with the mysterious Lord de Montfort, and apparently he has just committed a murder, since he is one of the two men who stand in a dreary outhouse adjoining Montfort Abbey. \"Red blood, yet warm, stains their murderous hands, and is seen also in pools upon the floor; the same marks are observable, also, on their clothes.\" \"The scene is a fearful one; it is one of those of which the mere recital makes the blood run cold,\" and the writer wisely does not attempt the task. In the penultimate chapter of this extraordinary production we are introduced to \"a certain young German, the Baron Von Oberfels,\" who weds Mary Learmont, the elder daughter of \"Sir James Learmont, who being a Baronet, was, moreover, a Knight of the Bath and M.P.\" Unfortunately the Baron \"was one of that horrible class, the Vampires! He had sold his soul to the evil one, for the enjoyment of perpetual youth; being bound, besides, to what are understood to be the penalties of that wretched and accursed race. Every tenth year a female was sacrificed to his infernal master. Mary Learmont was to be the next victim; may she escape the threatened doom.\" But apparently, so far as I can gather, she is not so lucky for we are vaguely told \"The Baron and his bride departed on his wedding tour. Her father and mother never hear of her more.\" A page or two later there is \"a midnight wedding\" at the Castle Von Oberfels. Of the bride we are told nothing save that she had a \"fair presence.\" \"The Baron Von Oberfels was there, once more arrayed in the\n\np. 331\n\ngarments of a bridegroom.\" The ceremony proceeds. The grand organ peals; the heavenly voices of white-robed choristers added greatly to the beauty of the scene. \"But hark! another noise is heard; sulphureous smoke half fills the sacred building; the floor opens for an instant; and mocking shrieks are audible as the spirit of the Last of the Vampires descended into perdition.\"\n\nI am bound to acknowledge that after a somewhat careful reading of this curious and most disjointed little piece of seventy-six pages the only impression with which I am met is that Mr. Smyth Upton knew nothing whatsoever of what the word vampire connotes. The idea of the victims who are sacrificed for the sake of eternal youth is, of course fairly common and was very effectively utilized by G. W. M. Reynolds in his romance The Necromancer, which ran in Reynolds's Miscellany from Saturday, 27th December, 1851, to Saturday, 31st July, 1852.[66] Incidentally it maybe remarked as a somewhat curious fact that this prolific novelist never availed himself of the vampire tradition in his melodramatic chapters.\n\nThe Vampyre. \"By the Wife of a Medical Man,\" 1858, is a, violent teetotal tract, of twenty-seven short chapters presented in the guise of fiction. The villain of the piece is \"The Vampyre Inn,\" and the dipsomaniac hero--if it be allowable to use the term in such a context--is given to ravings such as these: \"They fly--they bite--they suck my blood--I die. That hideous 'Vampyre!' Its eyes pierce me thro'--they are red--they are bloodshot. Tear it from my pillow. I dare not lie down. It bites--I die! Give me brandy--brandy--more brandy.\"\n\nA Vampire of Souls, by H. M. P., published in 1904, is a book of little value. The hero, George Ventnor, when aged twenty, is killed in a railway accident, and the narrative consists of his after experiences which are singularly material and crude. There is, perhaps, a good touch here and there, but the thing certainly does not deserve to be rescued from oblivion.\n\nIt will have been noticed that beyond the titles these two last works have really little or nothing to do with vampires at all, but we may now consider a romance which may at least be ranked as a very serious rival to--in my opinion it is far ghostlier than--its famous successor Dracula. Varney the Vampire, or, The Feast of Blood, is undoubtedly the best novel\n\np. 332\n\nof Thomas Preskett Prest, a prolific writer of the fourth and fifth decades of the nineteenth century. It is true that his productions published by the well-known Edward Lloyd, of 231, Shoreditch,[67] may be classed as simple \"shockers,\" but none the less he has considerable power in this kind, and he had at any rate the craft of telling his story with skill and address. There is a certain quality in his work, which appeared during the years from 1839 to the earlier fifties, that is entirely lacking in the productions of his fellows. To him have been ascribed, doubtless with some exaggeration, well nigh two hundred titles, but the following list comprises, I believe, his principal romances: Ela, the Outcast, or, the Gipsy of Rosemary Dell; Angelina, or, the Mystery of S. Mark's Abbey, \"a Tale of Other Days \"; The Death Grasp, or, A Father's Curse; Ernnestine De Lacy, or, The Robbers' Foundling; Gallant Tom, or, The Perils of a Sailor Ashore and Afloat, \"an original nautical romance of deep and pathetic interest \"; Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street (the most famous of Prest's novels); Newgate (which has some capital episodes); Emily Fitzormond; Mary Clifford; The Maniac Father, or, The Victim of Seduction; Gertrude of the Rock; Rosalie, or, The Vagrant's Daughter; The Miller's Maid; Jane Brightwell; Blanche, or, The Mystery of the Doomed House; The Blighted Heart, or, The Priory Ruins; Sawney Bean, the Man-eater of Midlothian; The Skeleton Clutch, or, The Goblet of Gore; The Black Monk, or, The Secret of the Grey Turret[68]; The Miller and His Men, or, The Secret Robbers of Bohemia. To Prest also has been attributed, but I conceive without foundation, Susan Hoply, an audacious piracy upon the famous novel by Mrs. Crowe, Susan Hopley.\n\nVarney the Vampire, or, The Feast of Blood, was first published in 1847. It contains no less than CCXX chapters and runs to 868 pages. The many incidents succeed each other with such breathless rapidity that it were well-nigh impossible to attempt any conspectus of the whole romance. The very length would make this analysis a work of extreme difficulty, and incidentally we may note the amazing copiousness of Prest which must ever remain a matter for wonderment. Such a romance, for example, as Newgate runs to no less than on, hundred and forty-nine chapters comprising 772 pages. The Maniac Father has fifty-four chapters, each of considerable\n\np. 333\n\nlength, which total 604 pages, and I have not selected these on account of their exceptional volume.\n\nVarney the Vampire was among the most popular of Prest's productions, and on account of its \"unprecedented success\" it was reprinted in 1853 in penny parts. To-day the book is unprocurable and considerable sums have been for many years in vain offered to secure a copy. Indeed, it may be noted that all Prest's work is excessively scarce.\n\nIt is hardly an exaggeration to affirm that of recent years there have been few books which have been more popular than Brain Stoker's Dracula, A tale, and certainly there is no sensational romance which in modern days has achieved so universal a reputation. Since it was first published in 1897, that is to say one and twenty years ago, it has run into a great number of editions, and the name has veritably become a household word. It will prove interesting to inquire into the immediate causes which have brought this book such wide and enduring fame. It has already been remarked that it is well-nigh impossible for a story which deals with the supernatural or the horrible to be sustained to any great length. Elements which at first are almost unendurable, will lose their effect if they are continued, for the reader's mind insensibly becomes inured to fresh emotions of awe and horror, and Dracula is by no means briefly told. In the ordinary reprints (Tenth Edition, 1913) it extends to more than four hundred pages, nor does it escape the penalty of its prolixity. The first part, \"Jonathan Harker's Journal,\" which consists of four chapters is most admirably done, and could the whole story have been sustained at so high a level we should have had a complete masterpiece. But that were scarcely possible. The description of the journey through Transylvania is interesting to a degree, and even has passages which attain to something like charm. \"All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear.\" Very effective is the arrival of the English traveller at the \"vast ruined castle, from, whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose\n\np. 334\n\nbroken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.\" Very adroitly are the various incidents managed in their quick succession, those mysterious happenings which at last convince the matter-of-fact commonplace young solicitor of Exeter that he is a helpless prisoner in the power of a relentless and fearful being. The continual contrasts between business conversations, the most ordinary events of the dull listless days, and all the while the mantling of dark shadows in the background and the onrushing of some monstrous doom are in these opening chapters most excellently managed.\n\nSo tense a strain could not be preserved, and consequently when we are abruptly transported to Whitby and the rather tedious courtships of Lucy Westenra, who is a lay figure at best, we feel that a good deal of the interest has already begun to evaporate. I would hasten to add that before long it is again picked up, but it is never sustained in the same degree; and good sound sensational fare as we have set before us, fare which I have myself more than once thoroughly enjoyed, yet it is difficult not to feel that one's palate, has been a little spoiled by the nonpareil of an antipast. This is not to say that the various complications are not sufficiently thrilling, but because of their very bounty now and again they most palpably fail of effect, and it can hardly escape notice that the author begins to avail himself of those more extravagant details of vampirism which frankly have no place outside the stories told round a winter's hearth, It would have been better had he confined himself to those particulars which are known and accepted, which indeed have been officially certified and definitely proved. But to have limited himself thus would have meant the shortening of his narrative, and here we return to the point which was made above.\n\nIf we review Dracula from a purely literary point of approach it must be acknowledged that there is much careless writing and many pages could have been compressed and something revised with considerable profit. It is hardly possible to feel any great interest in the characters, they are labels rather than individuals. As I have said, there are passages of graphic beauty, passages of graphic horror, but these again almost entirely occur within the first sixty pages. There are some capital incidents, for example the method by which Lord p. 335 Godalming and his friend obtain admittance to No. 347 Piccadilly. Nor does this by any means stand alone.\n\nHowever, when we have--quite fairly, I hope--thus criticized Dracula, the fact remains that it is a book of unwonted interest and fascination. Accordingly we are bound to acknowledge that the reason for the immense popularity of this romance, the reason why, in spite of obvious faults it is read and re-read--lies in the choice of subject and for this the author deserves all praise.\n\nIt might not have seemed that Dracula would have been a very promising subject for the stage, but nevertheless it was dramatized by Hamilton Deans and produced at the Wimbledon Theatre on 9th March, 1925. This version was performed in London at the Little Theatre, 14th February, 1927. On the preceding Thursday the Daily Mirror published a photograph of the late Mr. Brain Stoker accompanied by the following paragraphs. \"Herewith, one of the very few photographs of the late Brain Stoker, who, besides being Sir Henry Irving's manager for years, was an industrious novelist. As I have already said, a dramatic version of his most famous book, 'Dracula,' is to be done at the Little on Monday, and the scene of the Grand Guignol plays is appropriate, for the new piece, I hear, is so full of gruesome thrills that, in the provinces women having been carried fainting from the auditorium. Truly we take our pleasures sadly.\n\n\"The dramatic adaptation is by Hamilton Deans, whose grandfather, Colonel Deans, and the Rev. Abraham Stoker, Bram's father, lived on adjoining estates in County Dublin. Young Bram and Hamilton Deane's mother, then a young girl, were great friends. Stoker had the book 'Dracula' in his mind, and the young people used to discuss its possibilities. Strange that it should be young Hamilton Deane who has dramatized the book and brought the play to London.\"\n\nAt the Little Theatre the cast of Dracula was as follows: Count Dracula, Raymond Huntley; Abraham van Helsing, Hamilton Deane; Dr. Seward, Stuart Lomath; Jonathan Harker, Bernard Guest; Quincey P. Morris, Frieda Hearn; Lord Godalming, Peter Jackson; R. M. Renfield, Bernard Jukes; The Warden, Jack Howarth; The Parlourmaid, Hilda Macleod; The Housemaid, Betty Murgatroyd; Mina Harker, Dora Mary Patrick.\n\np. 336\n\nBy no stretch could it be called a good play, whilst the presentation, at the best, can hardly be described as more than reasonably adequate. In one or two instances the effects, upon which so much depends and which obviously demanded the most scrupulous care, were so clumsily contrived as to excite an involuntary smile. \"It was only a step from the devilish to the ridiculous on Monday night,\" said the Era, 16th February, 1927. Very remarkable was a lady, dressed in the uniform of a hospital nurse who sat in the vestibule of the theatre, and it was bruited that her services were required by members of the audience who were overcome owing to the horrors of the drama. I can only say that I find this canard impossible to believe, quodcumque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi. As an advertisement, and it can surely have been nothing else, the attendance of a nurse was in deplorable taste. I am informed that after the first few weeks a kind of epilogue was spoken when all the characters were assembled upon the stage, and it was explained that the audience must not be distressed at what they had seen, that it was comically intended for their entertainment. So gross a lapse of good manners, not to speak of the artistic indecorum, is hardly credible.[69]\n\nConfessedly the play was extremely weak, and yet such is the fascination of this subject that it had an exceptional success, and triumphantly made its way from theatre to theatre. On 25th July, 1927, Dracula was transferred to the Duke of York's; on the 29th August, following to the Prince of Wales, on 10th October to the Garrick; and all the while it was given to thronging houses. It has also toured, and at the present moment is still touring the provincial theatres with the most marked success, the drama being given with more spirit and vigour than originally was the case at the Little, and Wilfrid Fletcher in particular playing the lunatic Renfield with a real touch of wistful pathos and uncanny horror. This is is extremely instructive, and it is curious that the vogue of the \"vampire play\" in London should be repeated almost exactly after the interval of a century. On 5th November, 1927, a new version of Dracula by Charles Morrel was presented at the Court Theatre, Warrington.\n\nIn America the dramatization of Dracula was produced at the Shubert, New Haven, 19th September, 1927. This was given at the Fulton, New York, upon the following 5th October.\n\np. 337\n\nJonathan Harker was acted by Terence Neil; Abraham Van Helsing by Edward Van Sloan; Renfield by Bernard Jukes; and Count Dracula by Bela Lugoni .\n\nAs I have before remarked, the striking fact that an indifferent play should prove so successful can, I think, only be attributed to the fascination of the theme. Consciously or unconsciously it is realized that the vampire tradition contains far more truth than the ordinary individual cares to appreciate and acknowledge. \"La fable du vampire est peut-\u00eatre, la plus universelle de nos superstitions. . . . Elle a partout l'autorit\u00e9 de la tradition: elle ne manque ni de cello de la philosophic ni de celle de la m\u00e9dicine.

Fluorescent light glares off the hard planes of plastic tables and the linoleum floor. Styrofoam cups of Coca-Cola and instant coffee are on offer to visitors. The spare environment conveys efficiency and reassures the visitor that the familiar sights, smells, and tastes of a prefabricated American culture can prevail even here, inside this artificial bubble, away from the noise of the teeming streets, the hot crush of laboring bodies, and the swirling aromas of charcoal, sweat, diesel exhaust, and rotting garbage; (A decade later, journalist Christian Parenti will describe a similar atmospheric cocoon  inside the Green Zone  in U.S.-occupied Iraq. 1 )\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I visit Haiti in the company of a human-rights lawyer and a Haitian-American translator. Our task: to prepare a report on the aftermath of the notorious 1991coup d\u2019\u00e9tat that removed from power a democratically elected and wildly popular president, former priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The coup regime that followed presided over three years of terror, during which some five thousand men, women, and children were killed (to name only the conservative estimates of human rights reports) before U.S. Marines landed in a much-celebrated \"intervention\" in October 1994. Our team's report will focus on the evidence for an orchestrated campaign of sexual assault and torture, carried out by police and paramilitary forces, especially in the poorer neighborhoods of Port-au-Prince. The report we write will be one of the first to focus upon state \u2013sponsor sexual violence against women as a human rights crime. 2\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Only yesterday, we made our way on foot down the dusty, debris-strewn alleys of Petionville to meet with a group of forty Haitian women, including frightened teenage girls and wizened old ti machann, the street vendors who scratch together a living peddling charcoal stubs, fruit, or chunks of sugarcane in the choking dust and exhaust of the streets. The wide difference in their ages notwithstanding, these women had all been brutally raped and beaten by organized squads of police and paramilitary thugs, members of the notorious Front for the Advancement of the Haitian People (in French, FRAPH), who had swept through their neighborhoods in waves of terror by night. Some of these women had been forced to watch their children beaten or tortured in front of them; others had watched their husbands or lovers killed or abducted, never to be seen again.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In the months after those attacks, all of these women had come under the cautious, solicitous care of a team of Haitian women lawyers and therapists. After more than a year together, they had decided as a group to go before a much anticipated \"truth commission\" to tell their stories.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 These courageous women shared a modest lunch of soup and chicken with us, then sang a robust chorus about freedom and invited us to join in an exuberant circle dance. At last, choking back tears and anger, a few of them told us their stories. Several said they still recognized their attackers on the street from time to time, wearing the new uniform of the reorganized Haitian National Police. Although the United Nations was taking extraordinary measures to protect their_ identities, we asked the women if they feared reprisals even now from the men who had attacked them. \"I do not care what they do to me,\" one woman in her sixties immediately replied, straightening her six-foot frame. \"They killed my husband; they can try to kill me. Men m'ap gen jistis!-But I will have justice!\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Today, with her cry still ringing in our ears, we have come to the U.S. embassy with something less than optimism. Although the Clinton administration has claimed credit for ending the coup regime by sending Marines ashore in Octoher 1994, we are only too aware how carefully the intervention was structured to protect the coup leaders from prosecution, to obscure any record of U.S. involvement in the violence of the three-year coup regime, and to circumscribe the executive powers of the newly restored president, Aristide.3\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 With such ominous precedents before us, we want to know what role the U.S. government intends to take in bringing other perpetrators, the \"small fry,\" to justice-for accountability was, after all, what Americans were told was the goal of the 1994 U.S. invasion. We have already heard Haitian human rights leaders voice their grave suspicion that the U.S. government's default on a promise of one million dollars for the long-delayed \"truth commission\" indicates that the United States will undermine any genuine effort to bring the criminals to account.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The State Department attach\u00e9 for human rights extends a friendly hand and offers us Cokes. A freshly scrubbed young man with an Ivy League education, looking every bit the calm and efficient young professional though (as he tells us) he is only a few weeks into his new job, he can afford to be cheerful. \"U.S. policy in Haiti is the last great experiment in Wilsonian democracy,\" he buoyantly explains. \"What the United States hopes for is another success story like El Salvador.\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Our faces betray that his comment has taken us aback. I wonder whether, by naming Wilson, this earnest young man really wants to evoke the horrors perpetrated by Woodrow Wilson's Marines in the wake of the first U.S. invasion of Haiti, what a subsequent internal Marine inquiry described as the \"indiscriminate killing\" of perhaps 15,000 \"natives,\" and what a Marine officer later called \"hunting down\" suspected rebels (meaning any who resisted or fled) \"like pigs.''4 Or does the historical record simply not intrude on the imaginative world this young acolyte of U.S. policy has learned to inhabit?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The human-rights lawyer with our delegation asks what makes El Salvador a \"success story.\" She observes that the U.S.-brokered peace accords in El Salvador bestowed immunity from prosecution upon the military and civilian architects of twelve years of repression: the engineers of approximately 70,000 civilian deaths per U.N. estimates. She wonders aloud how that result squares with U.S. government commitments, through international covenants like the U.N. Charter and the Organization of American States Convention on Human Rights, never to allow immunity from prosecution for gross human rights violations. Will it be U.S. policy to grant tacit impunity to the architects of similarly horrific crimes in Haiti?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The attach\u00e9 looks us over with a flinty calculation. Perhaps, l imagine, he is trying to fathom how much we actually know about the State Department's role in recent events. At last he offers a broad, disarming smile. \"Ah, that's the perennial question of the Western hemisphere, isn't it?\" he asks. \"Whether to seek vengeance against the 'bad guys,' or to let bygones be bygones and get on with creating a Western-style democracy.\" 5\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We talk for a few minutes more, but our questions get no further than that half smirking reference to armed teams of rapists and murderers as \"the bad guys,\" and a facile equation of accountability-the minimum threshold of justice required under international law-with irrational impulses to \"vengeance.\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst to see right prevail,\" Jesus declared: \"they shall be satisfied\" (Matt. 5:6, REB). The Haitian women we met in Petionville spoke with throats parched with that thirst for j6stice. For at least one official carrying out U.S. policy in Port-au-Prince, on the other hand, it seems the only thirst that matters can readily be slaked with the offer of another Coca-Cola.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-------- Posing a Perennial Question ------\n\nMy concern in the following pages is with the question of justice. Justice is not only the \"perennial question\" that haunts U.S. policy in the Western Hemisphere. Justice is the question, or better, the contest at the heart of what Marxist critic Fredric Jameson has called the \"single vast unfinished plot\" that is human history. That plot, which Jameson characterizes as \"the collective struggle to wrest a realm of Freedom from a realm of Necessity,\" is the ultimate horizon of all human cultural expressions, and of their interpretation. The consequence Jameson draws is that our conventional habit of distinguishing\" cultural texts that are social and political and those that are not\" -religious texts, for example-is \"something worse than an error.\" It is a symptom of the pervasive logic of capitalist culture which privatizes individual experience and insulates the individual imagination from the horizons of political change. 6\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Jameson's point is perhaps nowhere more evident than with regard to the interpretation of Paul's letter to the Romans. Contestation over justice is at the heart of the letter, but that fact has been long obscured by the Christian dogmatic tradition. Library shelves groan under the weight of volumes insisting that the dikaiosyne tou theou of which Paul speaks is a purely theological concept, the \"righteousness\" that is a transcendent attribute of God alone; or else it is, as an expression of that righteousness, the \"justification\" that God imputes to human sinners, regardless of their action for good or ill. These phenomena are so sublime, so abstract, and so beyond analogy with mere human justice that only carefully trained theological professionals may comprehend and interpret them accurately.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That dogmatically determined construal of the letter has been challenged, however, first by liberation theologians in Central America. In Marxism and the Bible (1974), Jose Porfirio Miranda argued that justice between human beings was the \"revolutionary and absolutely central message\" of Romans, a message \"customarily avoided by exegesis.\" 7 In The Amnesty of Grace (1991), Elsa Tamez protested the abstraction, universalism, and individualism of the classical doctrine of justification by faith, which when applied in the abstract to the realities of Latin America, \"where the most obvious sin is structural\" and where \"the sins that kill are very tangible,\" yielded disastrous results: \"justification viewed from an abstract, individual, and generic plane is good news more for the oppressors than for the poor.\" For Tamez, the consequence for responsible interpretation of Paul's thought was a simple and straightforward commitment: \"to reject every approach that favors the rich to the detriment of the poor.\" 8\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Subsequently, North American scholars have argued for a re-politicized reading of Romans (that is, for a reversal of previous reading practices that de-politicized the letter). In Liberating Paul (1994), I protested the theological \"mystification\" of Paul and the \"Babylonian captivity of the letter to the Romans\" in the powerful wake of Reformation dogmatics, developments that marginalized the political aspects of Paul's thought. 9 In Reading Derrida/Thinking Paul, Theodore W. Jennings Jr. has lamented the restriction of the reading of Romans \"to a confessional/ecclesiastical ghetto of doctrinal interest\"; the result, he protests, is that \"Paul's concern for the question of justice has been transformed into a question of  interior or private righteousness.\" As a result of this theological manhandling on the part of the apostle's \"ecclesial and dogmatic jailers,\" \"the question of justice has been effectively silenced, substituting in its place a doctrine of justification that absolves the believer from the claim and call of justice. \"10 In their commentary on Romans, John B. Cobb Jr. and David]. Lull observe that \"in the Roman Empire, what people today call 'religion' and 'politics' were inseparable\"; they find in Romans a vision \"that sharply contradicted the political theology\" of Paul's day. 11 Most recently, in  his Hermeneia commentary, Robert Jewett has declared that \"the argument of  Romans revolves around the question of  which rule is truly righteous and which gospel has the power to make the world truly peaceful.''12\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But these perspectives on the letter are not yet prevalent in scholarship, or in North American Christianity. The dominant reading of Romans among Reformation churches, emphasizing justification by grace through faith alone has often had a quiescence effect, serving to neutralize  impulses toward collective action for social change, At the same time, the cultural currents that wash-through more evangelical and Fundamentalist church and, increasingly, throughout U.S. political life promote the powerful impression that the righteousness that so preoccupied the biblical God is a matter of strictly personal morality and of adherence  to a strident nationalism. This understanding of \"righteousness,\" Helmut Koester has observed, \"functions as an important support for the structures of the state,\" calling forth proper decorum and due respect, especially from the religious. However, Koester protests that the moralistic interpretation of Paul is \"impossible\": Paul's God was \"not interested in righteous individuals,\" but wanted \"to create righteousness and justice for people, for communities, and for nations. \"13\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The reading of Paul against which Koester protests is readily illustrated. Perhaps no biblical text is more often deployed \"as an important support for the structures of the state\" than the notorious exhortation to \"be subject to the governing authorities\" in Rom 13:1-7. A single personal anecdote may serve the point.\n\nHannibal, Missouri, March 2003\n\nThe weekend after George W. Bush ordered the bombing and military invasion of Iraq in what is customarily called the Second Iraq War, I walked through downtown Hannibal, Missouri, a town that relies for tourism on its fame as the home town of American author and humorist Mark Twain. Like many town centers across the United States, the Hannibal main street was decked out in U.S. flags, yellow ribbons, and placards urging passersby to \"Support Our Troops.'' One solitary sign of dissent hung in a coffee shop window, a single typed page inviting citizens to an evening\" discussion of the war.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The woman who had posted the modest invitation told me that neighbors had already challenged her \"anti-Americanism.\" \"It's hard to question the war in Hannibal,\" she said. When I asked how that squared with the town's public celebration of the best known member of the Anti-Imperialist League, she answered, \"that would be news here. Most people in Hannibal don't know anything about Mark Twain beyond The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A tour of the local museums bore out her point: An exhibit dedicated to Mark Twain's literary career focused almost exclusively on his humorous writings. I found two references to Twain's literary tours of Europe, but not a hint that he had spoken regularly and often in Europe, as well as in the United States, on behalf of the Anti-Imperialist League. On one wall, a turn-of-the-century newspaper cartoon depicted Twain seated upon a throne, being paid court by the \"Crowned Heads of Europe\"; behind his throne, a single figure labeled \"Leopold\" sat dejected, his head on his fist. The museum caption described Twain's fame in Europe but offered no explanation of Leopold. No one would learn in this museum of the horrific atrocities carried out in the Congo by King Leopold of Belgium, or of Twain's fervent efforts, alongside other activists in Europe and the United States, to make those atrocities an international cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. 14\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Newspaper advertisements and hastily erected signs around town invited residents and visitors to attend \"prayer services for our troops\" at any of a number of local churches. In most other American cities, the signs might have been unexceptional, but they struck an ironic note in Hannibal, where every gift shop and museum store sold several different editions of Mark Twain's short, bitterly satirical essay, War Prayer. The essay tells of a mysterious stranger who interrupts the eloquent prayers of a local pastor on a Sunday morning and points out to the congregation that an unspoken prayer has accompanied their spoken words to heaven. Their prayer for victory is also a prayer for the God of love to blight the land and the homes of the enemy, to leave widows and orphans desolate and without hope. 15\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I saw no invitations from churches to discuss the War Prayer. Except for that single conversation in a coffee shop, there was no indication that anyone in Mark Twain's home town was the least troubled by invitations to join in prayers (in the phrasing of a ubiquitous bumper sticker) to \"Support Our Troops.\" Indeed, the only literary allusion informing the cultural discourse of Hannibal, Missouri, accompanied one local pastor's letter in the local newspaper. He wrote, \"It is the duty of all Christians to stand with their president in a time of war (Rom 13:1-7).\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 If Hannibal were exceptional, I would not recount the experience. My point is that even in one town where one might have expected the flicker of a thoroughly American anti-war sentiment to be visible, discussion could be managed, and dissent largely precluded (in public as well as in the churches), by an appeal to Paul's letter to the Romans.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0------------Reading Differently ------------\n\nThe argument of this book is that from its very first lines, Paul's letter burns with the incendiary proclamation of God's justice, and with a searing critique of the injustice (adikia) of those who smother and suppress the truth (1:17-18). The themes that dominate Romans are political topics: the imagination of a global order achieved through the obedience of nations (see chap. 1 below); the arrogance and hypocrisy of wicked rulers who suppress the truth (chap. 2); the tension between justice and the pretensions to \"mercy\" shown by the conqueror to the vanquished (chap. 3); the serviceability of religious values and popular devotion (chap. 4); and questions of realism, hope, and the common good (chap. 5). These themes reveal how powerfully Paul and the assemblies he addressed were caught up in the swirling currents of Roman imperial culture. That culture, like all imperial cultures ancient and modern, was preoccupied with what the late cultural critic Edward Said called \"notions that certain territories and people require and beseech domination.\" Said\u2019s insistence that we \"take empire seriously\" and abandon the pretense of neutrality regarding its effects has helped to inspire the rise of postcolonia1criticism in biblical studies. One of the leading figures in this development, Fernando F. Segovia, applies the principle by insisting that a fully contextualized  reading of the New Testament texts must address \"the reality of empire\" as \"an omnipresent, inescapable, and overwhelming sociopolitical reality. 16\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Taking empire seriously in biblical interpretation requires looking in two directions at once. Looking back at the ancient Roman Empire, we will attend to what Marxist historian G. E. M. de Ste. Croix has called \"a massive system of exploitation of the great majority by the ruling classes,\" and of the myriad ways, which Ste. Croix and others have ably documented, in which imperial rule, and the ideological representation of the emperor\u2018s role in particular, served to maintain and reinforce a thoroughly \"parasitic\" economic system. 17 Looking simultaneously at our own context, we must be as alert to the \"cultural logic of late capitalism\" that informs and shapes contemporary life, including what sociologists have termed the \"production of the sacred\" in public religion and the academic disciplines involved in biblical studies . 18\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There are significant points of analogy between ancient Roman imperialism and the complex fabric of contemporary imperialism, by which I mean both the global military supremacy that is official U.S. policy and the globalizing capitalism that it serves.  19 There is admittedly a danger here of anachronism in comparing two very different historical contexts; but a greater danger would be a failure to take seriously the resemblance between the ways distinct ideologies serve to legitimate and naturalize the dominant social order in both ancient Roman and contemporary U.S. imperialism. In both contexts, for example, representations of benevolence, paternalism, and authority, focused in the fight of a single wise, caring, autocratic ruler, serve to mask the exploitative dynamics of the economic order. Precisely because my concern is an ancient text that continues to be invested with tremendous authority in the U.S. culture, understanding the dominant ideological functions of rhetoric in both contexts is an urgent task. 20\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Because so many of us-in the U.S. culture broadly, in American churches especially, but in academic circles as well-suffer what Said decried as the \"astonishing sense of weightlessness\" regarding \"the gravity of history, 21the effort that follows, to read Paul's letter in the context of Roman imperial ideology, may at first glance appear eccentric. The less traveled path on which I embark in the following pages has seen increasing traffic in recent years, however, in the work of scholarly colleagues in the Paul and Politics section of the Society of Biblical Literature, and beyond. 22 Those colleagues will recognize my debts to their efforts to take empire seriously; others will recognize how much I owe as well, to advances in the growing fields of rhetorical criticism and postcolonial interpretation, and to the interest in \"people's history\" and the hidden transcripts of subordinated or marginalized groups.  23\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The greatest challenge to a political reading of Romans is the broad assumption that we already know what Romans is about. It is, we commonly assume, self-evidently a debate with Judaism, its argument directed primarily against Jewish works-righteousness (on an older, Lutheran reading),  or against the Jewish ethnocentrism that  mobilized a concerted Jewish opposition to Paul\u2019s intolerably inclusive gospel (according to the \u201c New Perspective\u201d). But the letter is explicitly addressed to nun-Judeans, representatives of \"the nations\" (ta ethni, commonly rendered \"Gentiles\": see below). In The Rhetoric of Romans (1990) I argued that given that clear and explicit address (see 1:5-7, 11-15; 15:14 16), the rhetoric of Romans must be read as directed to that audience. As Stanley K. Stowers later made the point in A Rereading of Romans  (1994), the habit of importing an implied Jewish audience serves dogmatic and apologetic purposes but flouts the clear rhetorical indicators of the letter. Ben Witherington III has taken the same approach in his socio-rhetorical commentary to Romans. 24 I will presume those 111ore extensive arguments regarding the letter's non-Judean audience in what follows.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But more is at stake in our interpretation than an accurate reading of the letter's argumentation. Too often, theological readings of Romans have relied on historically untenable stereotypes of Jews and Judaism. The not-yet universal recognition of that fact has both fueled and complicated the modern study of Paul. Conventional readings also serve-as they have served for centuries-to reinforce a distinctive Christian self-understanding, as if it had been the apostle's purpose to provide Gentile Christians, both ancient and modern, a sort of theological pedigree for heir legitimacy. Indeed, a long train of interpreters, beginning with Krister Stenahl, have asserted that such defense or legitimation of the Gentile church was the letter's foremost purpose. 25 In this way, the force of Paul's rhetoric is deflected away from us-the modern, comfortable, more-or-less secularized first-world Christians who remain the primary consumers of Pauline scholarship, and for whom questions of lsrael 's destiny and the observance of the Jewish law are usually a matter of only moderate academic interest-onto them, the Jews who \"failed\" to accept the Pauline gospel of universalism that we presume as self-evident, and whom we can afford to regard, from a safe emotional distance, with a polite blend of curiosity and condescension.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As often as we treat Romans differently from Paul's other letters, imagining that it is not a letter of urgent exhortation as they are, we who imagine ourselves to be the modern heirs of his universalistic legacy ensure that we have nothing to fear from it. Whether we are properly tolerant Christians or appropriately liberal academics,) or both, we can rest assured that Paul has nothing critical to say to us. Indeed, if his) purpose was to defend the incipient Gentile-Christian movement-\"people like us,\" after all-from the irrational opposition of prejudiced rivals, then we can read Romans with a certain self-congratulatory satisfaction. His words do not touch on our privileges or presumptions; they rather commend our prerogatives.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But this is not the way we should hear Romans. To the contrary, this letter challenged, criticized, and confronted what Paul considered troubling aspects of the nascent movement of Christ-believers in his day. One goal in the following pages is to dispel some of the theological fog surrounding Romans, and thus to overcome some of \"the astonishing sense of weightlessness\" in Pauline studies with regard to the gravity of imperial power. I we o not immediately hear the counter-imperial aspects of Paul's letter, perhaps1it is because we are predisposed, by the constricted, privatized, and domesticated contexts in which Paul's letters are most usually read, to perceive in them only a narrow bandwidth of what we consider religious discourse. 26 If one effect of this work is to challenge such notions, it shall have served an important purpose. For those of us who recognize that American imperial ambition and myths of national innocence have distorted and disrupted the witness of contemporary faith communities, and especially Christian churches, to an alternative citizenship, few messages could be more urgent.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0--------- Toward a Contemporary Sachkritik ----------\n\nIf we intend to approach the letter to the Romans with the sort of theological seriousness that Karl Barth offered in the early twentieth century, we will need, like him, to read Romans alert to \"the situation in which we ourselves actually are.\" Barth encountered in Romans \"that which urgently and finally concerns the very marrow of human civilization.\" 27 In Romans, I contend, we see Pau1's critical engagement with the claims of imperial ideology and with the corrosive effects of those claims within the Roman congregations of Christ-believers. The material realities in which we live require that a contemporary  Sachkritik , our own effort to penetrate \"the inner dialectic of the matter\u201d must take with utmost seriousness the ideological forces that shape our own perceptions, determine our own attitudes, and elicit our own compliance (or least our acquiescence) as well.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 No legitimate reading of Romans in our contemporary situation can remain oblivious to the effects of empire today. Precisely because of the ideological forces that constrain our perceptions, however, such a Sachkritik will not come easily to many of us.\n\nReading the signs of the times\n\nOver the last quarter century, we who live in the global North, who are accustomed to reading the Bible in conditions of unprecedented comfort and privilege, have, been faced with a new challenge: to learn to hear the biblical voices anew by attending to how our neighbors living at the periphery of imperial culture hear and experience them. If we open ourselves to them, the bearers of so-called theologies of liberation and postcolonial criticism can alert us to the sociopolitical forces at work in our own lives as well as theirs. From our global neighbors, we can learn if we will listen-that \u201cno theology and no institutional church can be examined in a vacuum: they must be considered in the context of the political and social reality in which they exist and act. \u201cSo wrote Jose Comblin, a liberation theologian working in Brazil; for whom \"political and social reality\" meant living under \"American empire and ... its farthest-reaching export-the national security state.\" 28  Writing in 1979, Comblin had Latin American realities particularly in view; but his comments apply as well to the fateful U.S. support for other national security states like the Baathist regime in Iraq through the 1980s, or the far more lethal military regime in Indonesia through the 1990s, to select but two representative cases.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Our neighbors in the global South, and a swelling chorus of prophetic voices in the North, implore us to take in a disturbing truth. The militarized empire of global capitalism, the very system that has brought so many of us unparalleled prosperity, which so many of us even regard as sacred, continues to devastate their lives and the lives of their children. It is hard to take in that truth. It is hard, in part, because it is so much easier for us to recognize the evils of other systems-formerly, of Soviet expansionism, or now, of the organized terrorism aimed at U.S. Middle East policies-than the evils of the system in which we live, and from which we live, and from which we reap undeniable material benefits.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It is hard to take in that truth, in part, because as the martyred Jesuit academic Ignacio Ellacuda remarked, the \"fundamental dynamic\" of this system, its \"pitiless exploitation,\" \"intrinsic malice,\" and \"predatory ferocity,\" are ordinarily visible in their true magnitude \"only beyond the boundaries of the rich countries, which in numerous ways export the evils of capitalism to the exploited periphery.\" 29  It is possible for those living at the center of imperial culture to avoid seeing the effects of empire. One must immediately add the qualification that the\" exploited periphery\" exists at the blighted heart of many U.S. cities as well. Three decades ago, black theologians in the United States recognized that the regime of \"exploitative, profit oriented capitalism is a way of ordering life fundamentally alien to human value in general and to black humanity in particular. Racism and capitalism have set the stage for despoliation of natural and human resources all around the world,\" not least in our own cities. 30  The pernicious illusion nevertheless prevails that the exploited are personally and morally culpable for the ruinous effects of their own exploitation.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It is, finally, hard to take in this unwelcome truth because omnipresent, corporate-owned electronic media surround us with the messages that our system has won because of its own inherent superiority; that the miserable have earned their misery through sloth; that the sufferings that require our most urgent action are insults to our own national pride; and that our most important preoccupation must be constant, unremitting consumption (represented to us as \"our way of life\").31\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 However unfamiliar and uncomfortable the perspective to which our global neighbors invite us, however, theological seriousness requires facing the material realities of our age and scrutinizing the dominant ideological representations of those realities on offer all around us. We should not imagine, with a post-modern sensibility, that attending to the themes of imperial ideology is simply one interpretive choice among others. I follow Fredric Jameson in regarding the political interpretation of literary texts like Romans \"not as some supplementary method, not as an optional auxiliary to ocher interpretive methods current today ... but rather as the absolute horizon of all reading and all interpretation.\" Holding Romans aloof from political interpretation as if it were fundamentally some other kind of writing, or as if political interpretation could not finally comprehend what was most essential to the letter, only reinforces the artificial distinction between \u201cpublic\u201d (and political) and \"private\" (and religious). Ultimately, insulating the interpretation of Romans from political and ideological criticism (or marginalizing political criticism as only one option among others) serves to reconfirm those ideological constraints that isolate religion from playing any meaningful role in history. \"The only effective liberation from such constraint,\" Jameson writes, \"begins with the recognition that there is nothing that is not social and historical-indeed, that everything is 'in the last analysis political. \"32 In similar terms, the theologians of liberation have called for decades for the recognition that first-world theology is as completely ideological a product as anything emerging from the periphery of empire.\n\nAn ideological-critical reading\n\nNeither, however, may we imagine that we can stand Paul at some transcendent point, looking down upon the plane of history as if he and we were completely free of its constraints. A Sachkritik attentive to the ideological forces at work in a historical situation-necessarily attends to what Jameson calls the strategies of containment by which those forces in Paul's day, and in our own, repress certain possibilities from consciousness. Jameson argues that because of the constraining power of ideology, a text often points obliquely beyond itself to possibilities that \"remain unrealized in the surface of the text.\" It follows that we cannot content ourselves to read the surface of a text like Romans, but must read beneath and behind it, or better, through it to get at the fundamental contestation of power that is inscribed in it. 33 We must read against the grain, listening for what remains unsaid (in Jameson's terms, what has been repressed) as much as what is said. 34\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That proposal is uncontroversial in the study of other writings from the early Roman period. We know that our classical sources left much unsaid that did not align with the interests of the dominant classes. Exceptions prove the rule: there were stridently anti-Roman voices raised in the first century, like the fiercely defiant British warriors Calgcus and Boudicca, for example. But we know of them only because long after they had fallen to their Roman conquerors, ,Tacitus attributed to them speeches that amplified his account of the expansion of Roman supremacy. We know that some Judeans of the Second Temple period protested Roman arrogance and violence, though none of our sources provide access to direct and criticism of Rome. It is universally recognized that the Habakkuk Pesher  from Qumran assails Romans in a bitter indictment, but they remain veiled under label Kittim. Fourth Maccabees expresses hostility to Roman rule, though disguised as an encomium on the \"self-control\" and \"philosophy\" of rebels of another age. 35 Even Josephus acknowledges the eloquence of anti-Roman rebels, though he demurs from providing samples (War 2.348).\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Paul issued no call to arms against Rome; he rallied no rebel garrison. If, however, we attend to those fissures in the text where a unified surface reading becomes impossible, we can recognize subterranean forces at work beneath Romans. Those forces are the object of our investigation. The rhetoric of Romans shows that Paul participated in a cultural transcript, drawing on the repertoires of Judean scripture and apocalyptic writings, that was inescapably in conflict with the empire's absolutizing claims allegiance. 36\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A political reading begins from the specificity of a given text in its full historical context, grasped, Jameson proposes, \"as the imaginary resolution of a real contradiction\" inherent in that historical context. 37 In the case of Romans, I contend, these are the contradictions inherent in a situation in which Roman imperial ideology has  come into conflict with alternative understanding of justice; order, and community among the empire's subjects. At a second, more general level, the text is apprehended as \"an individual parole or utterance\" within the broader collective and class discourses that \"fight it out within the general unity of a shared code.\" 38 We will not arbitrarily limit the range of discourses that constitute the context of Romans by setting the letter over against contemporary Judean writings alone, then, as has been the repeated practice in past theological interpretation. Rather we will situate Paul's letter and the writings of his Judean and non-Judean contemporaries in a broader context of varying responses to Roman rule. An ideological critical reading of Romans will investigate the effects in the letter of conflicting modes of production in the early Roman Empire, just as Norman Gottwald has taught us to recognize, in the Hebrew Bible, the evidence of seismic upheavals and collisions between conflicting modes of production and their corresponding ideological representations under the Persian Empire. 39\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But precisely because we are caught up in history as much as were Paul and his contemporaries; precisely because we have not reached the recently heralded \"end of history,\" but find ourselves engaged, as they were, in an unfinished drama in which competing visions of history's fulfillment are pitted against one another, for this reason we recognize with Jameson that the ultimate horizon of political interpretation is the sweep of history itself A text like Romans becomes an occasion to recognize in our own day, as in Paul's, the deep struggle through human history that is manifested, from the point of view of Marxist analysis, in conflicts between different material modes of production, but is experienced by its participants as the long-enduring struggle \"to wrest a realm of Freedom from a realm of Necessity\" (or as Paul phrased it,_ to experience \"the redemption of our bodies,\" Rom 8:23). A fully political Sachkritik of Romans involves our exploration of what is \"unsaid,\" unspeakable, and repressed in our own ideological environment as well. Postcolonial interpreters refer to the critical theological tasks of unmasking, unveiling, and uncovering the deep logic that legitimizes exploitation in our own day as well, especially where the legitimization of injustice bears the sheen of a divine patina. Ultimately, the \"decolonizing\" of modern biblical interpretation requires decolonizing us who are the first-world producers and consumers of biblical interpretation. 40Agreements and divergences\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The project I have just described requires situating the rhetoric of Romans within a broader rhetorical context, an environment where discourse was shaped and constrained by disparities of power. In the following pages, I will not-provide anything like a running commentary on Paul's letter. There are any number of valuable commentaries on Romans available, the most formidable being Robert Jewett's recent Hermeneia commentary, and I will try to reproduce their efforts. Given the space limitations of the present work, neither will I seek to catalogue points of agreement or disagreement, or polemically to argue for the superiority of my reading or the inadequacy of others where we disagree. My goal is simply to present a coherent reading of the letter that describes both the constraints on discourse, and countervailing impulses to resist those constraints in a particular imperial situation.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It may nevertheless be helpful at the outset to situate my reading on the landscape of current interpretations of Romans. First, I realize that proposing a political reading of the letter may seem tendentious to some. Equally, my repeated references to the deleterious effects of imperial culture may seem prejudicial to readers for whom the accomplishments of the Augustan age (or our own) are properly objects of admiration. As Karl Galinsky observes in the introduction to his monumental study Augustan Culture, \"our interpretations of the past are much influenced by our experience with contemporary society, politics, and culture.\" Currents in twentieth-century European politics have played a decisive role in the perceptions of Augustus and his age,41 and we should expect nothing different in a time when the self-declared imperial ambitions of contemporary American policymakers are also deeply controversial. Whether we should understand the rise of the Principate and the so-called Pax Romana primarily as a narrative of economic and political exploitation achieved through force, or as one of the most important accomplishments in the history of Western civilization-or both, on the grounds (well documented among the proponents of the Roman Empire) that genuine peace can be achieved only through force-these are judgments about which I will not try to change the reader's mind. (That Roman emperors and governors themselves described their motives as including the economic exploitation of the provinces is, of course, a simple matter of fact.)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Similarly, Augustus consolidated tremendous military, economic, political, moral, and sacred power, gaining broad acceptance for his rule on the basis of his own auctoritas-the \"material, intellectual, and moral superiority\" that provides the ultimate power of the emperor on the moral level.\"42 Whether that achievement has any lessons for our own when sweeping executive powers, including the exercise of personal discretion in interpreting the constitutional reach of those powers, have been claimed for the president of the world's greatest military power-is a question regarding which I will not attempt to persuade the reader, though I believe certain resemblances in the two situations are compelling.43\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Romans is widely regarded today as addressed to a specific situation in Rome. Tensions between Judean and non-Judean members of the assemblies gathering in Christ's name threatened Paul's understanding of his own apostolic responsibility. Paul addressed that situation with rhetoric that appealed to a common fund of shared values and convictions, including both Judean scripture (which he quoted here more than in any other letter) and the traditions of the early Christ-movement. So far I am in complete agreement with an emerging consensus.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I shall argue further that Paul also invoked recognizable themes from imperial propaganda, usually in such a way as implicitly to challenge them. I take those invocations and allusions as evidence that the situation in the Roman assemblies was shaped, not primarily by tensions somehow inherent in the proximity of different ethnic groups, as current social-scientific readings have suggested, but to perceptions and themes in the broader ideology and culture of the Augustan and post-Augustan age.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 As we shall see, a number of recent interpreters have alerted us to the political implications of some of Paul's vocabulary, for example \"messiah\" (christos), or \"lord\" (kyrios), or \"assembly\" (ekklesia). Others have shown that in a highly agonistic culture such as ancient Rome, where an intense competition for honor was played out within fixed relationships of superior and inferior, Paul's exhortations to mutual respect and deference would have been dramatically countercultural. These observations are important, but they tend to portray the tension between Paul's rhetoric and imperial ideology as indirect and rather incidental. I argue, in contrast, that the argument of Romans as a whole collides inescapably with the claims of empire, even if that collision is never expressed in explicit terms.\n\nIn previous,writings, I have described Paul's as an \"anti-imperial gospel\" and his theology as subversive of imperial values. Others have criticized such characterizations as imprecise and anachronistic. Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza has argued convincingly that labeling Paul's gospel \"counter-imperial\" prematurely rescues Paul or \"liberationist\" causes, obscures or avoids the extent to which \"even resistance literature\" can \"re-inscribe the structures of domination against which it seeks to argue,\" and relieves the interpreter of the duty \"to inquire as to how such inscribed imperial language functioned in the past, and still functions today.\"44 Though I intend to show that some aspects of Paul's rhetoric in Romans were subversive of some of the claims of imperial propaganda, I recognize that Paul never provides a systematic or comprehensive critique of the emperor (whom he never names) or of the empire as such. The empire as such is never his direct target: his goal is to lay a claim on the allegiance of his listeners with which the rival claims of empire inevitably interfered. It is not just that his argumentation is occasionally oblique. Paul's own thinking and rhetoric also was shaped by the ideological constraints of his age. He did not float serenely above his historical situation, as an approach to his letters as \"inspired scripture\" implies. To borrow an apt phrase from Schussler Fiorenza, Paul's thought was as fully kyriarchal, in its own way, as that of any imperial propagandist (see further chap. 1).45\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In so far as his thought was shaped by the contestation over power that surrounded him, and in which imperial themes and tropes were dominant, Paul resembled his Judean contemporaries. In strictly historical terms, then, I consider it anachronistic to read Romans as an early specimen of Christian theology. The letter is rather one expression of the range of Judean response to the Roman Empire. What makes Romans distinct from other contemporary Judean writings is no Paul's distance from other forms of Judaism, but the peculiar-one is tempted to say, unique-situation Paul addressed, namely, the recent ascendancy of a non-Judean majority in the local Roman assemblies of what was initially a Judean messianic movement (with all that that implied vis-a-vis Roman hegemony). I read the letter not as a Christian critique of Judaism, or a defense of Gentile Christianity, but as a Judean critique of an incipient non-Judean Christianity in which the pressures of imperial ideology were a decisive factor.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Several of the terms just used, especially Gentile and Christian, are admittedly anachronistic, and I will avoid them in what follows, or use them only advisedly. That may prove disconcerting to readers who expect to learn from these pages what Paul has to say to Christians. That is all to the good. We are well warned against interpretations that privilege the voice of Paul in artificial isolation from his own historical context and that thus serve, however unintentionally, to reinforce the most baleful effects of the Pauline legacy in contemporary society.46 Such principled warnings stand over against everything that follows. Seeking to interpret Paul in the context of Roman imperial power in his own day does not relieve us of the critical and ethical responsibilities we bear regarding imperialism in our own day. We must, at last, answer for ourselves.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A final qualification regarding my use of \"Judean\" to translate the Greek Ioudaios. Some scholars have recently proposed distinguishing between the term ]udeans, an ethnic and geographic term for a member of the people hailing from Judea, and the term Jews, denoting cultural and religious adherence to the way of life of that people Shaye Cohen has argued that it is anachroni,stic to speak of \"Jews\" before about 100 B.C.E.47 Philip F. Esler chooses to speak of \"Judeans\" in Paul's day as well, as a way of conveying both the ethnic-geographic and the religious components of Judean identity that \"both insiders and outsiders regarded as fundamental.\" something for which he argues our contemporary usage of\"Jew\" is inadequate.48 It is in just this respect that I employ the term Judean in what follows, though I do not in any wily mean to question or deny the historical continuity between the Ioudaioi who were Paul's contemporaries and the modern Jews who are mine.49 The burden against which I press throughout this book is the weight of the centuries-long projection into Paul's day of subsequent Christian stereotypes regarding Jews and Judaism. I use Judean here as a way of reminding the reader and myself that we are dealing with ancient terms, Ioudaios and Iudaeus, which were used both by those who were and by others who were not loudaioi to define what being Ioudaios meant. My interest is in letting first-century Judeans, Paul above all, speak for themselves.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0--- The Rhetoric of Romans and the Rhetoric of Rome ---\n\nA political Sachkritik of Romans requires us to situate Paul's rhetoric amid surrounding discourses as precisely as possible. This, in turn, requires attending to the way disparities in power constrain discourse in a colonial situation. Unfortunately, these are tasks for which traditional rhetorical criticism has proven itself flatly incapable.\n\nRhetorical-critical dead ends\n\nBecause of the legacy of Christian apologetics and Reformation polemics, Romans usually has been or is read as a religious document in which the apostle Paul sets out his distinctive theological views concerning Christian identity and practice, in implicit contrast, if not direct opposition, to the Jewish religion. This approach to Romans necessarily relies upon characterizations of Jews, Judaism., and the Jewish Law as somehow deficient in comparison with Paul's \"universal,\" \"law-free\" gospel. The Christian theological reading of Romans has also largely set the limits of the rhetorical-critical study of the letter. The widespread perception of the letter's double character, that is, as a letter written to non-Judeans that nonetheless is primarily concerned with Jewish themes, clearly begs rhetorical-critical investigation. 50\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But only rarely has rhetorical criticism led interpreters to question the assumptions, inherited from Reformation dogmatics that the letter is fundamentally Paul's presentation of a doctrine salvation, and that this doctrine is fundamentally incompatible with, and opposed to, the Judaism of this contemporaries.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The result is that for a majority of interpreters, the letter remains a theological sample by means of which Paul seeks to introduce himself or his gospel, to show [the Romans] in advance what his gospel will be,\" to offer \"an example of the kind of preaching or teaching he will practice when among them,\" \"to present his gospel\" to them so that they might \"know more about its character and his mode of argumentation,\" to introduce to them \"the teaching activity Paul hopes to do at Rome\" or \"the gospel to be . .. proclaimed [in Spain],\" including sample admonitions regarding a way of life \"that would ensure the success\" of the Spanish mission; to \"[provide] a sustained account of his understanding of the gospel\" to \"justify his message and mission\" by \"clarifying and defending his beliefs,\" to \"inform the church [in Rome] about his missionary theology\" so that they would \"know his thinking.\"\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 These common characterizations of the letter, couched predominantly in the subjunctive mood, as a theological \"position paper,\" a \"think piece\" drawn from the apostle's portfolio, have an impressive following 51 They coincide with a perception of the letter as written under circumstances free of constraint, a perception paricularly convenient for generalizations about the letter's content as Paul's \"basic theological position ... more or less completely set forth\" in its \"most complete and complex synthesis,\" \"the most sustained and reflective statement of Paul's own theology\"-again, views representative of a wide range of interpreters.52  But the characterizations I have just cited have scant basis in the text itsel\u00a3 Paul says nothing in the letter to indicate that he is presenting his own ideas to garner his readers' approval of himself or his mission.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Unfortunately, rhetorical-critical interpretations of Romans have often done little more than glean from the classical Greek and Roman rhetorical handbooks a novel technical nomenclature for an outline of the letter that has already been established, without the benefit of rhetorical categories, in dogmatic readings. For example, the conventional identification of Romans 1:16-17 as the theme or thesis of the letter, in defiance of the formal and syntactical features of those verses, is sometimes expressed now as a rhetorical-critical insight, though without anymore substantiation than an appeal to a \"consensus\" among interpreters.53 Similarly, some interpreters tend to describe the letter in terms resembling the genre of the philosophical treatise or letter essay, though it bears none of the hallmarks of the ancient letter essay54  Others seek to identify the rhetorical genre of the letter according to the categories of the ancient rhetorical handbooks, but falter on prior assumptions regarding the letter's purpose.55 In contrast, I expect the ancient handbooks to be of only limited usefulness in determining the genre of Romans. The handbooks were designed, after all; for the fairly formal expectations of public oratory in the Greco-Roman world. But as scholars of classical rhetoric themselves have reminded us, many forms of speech cannot be fitted into the fairly rigid categories of the handbooks: notably, the authoritative, often spontaneous, and ecstatic speech that is characteristic of what George A. Kennedy called \"religious\" rhetoric.56 Romans is persuasive rhetoric, but it is presented in terms of the announcement of the effective power of God (euangelizesthai), a mode of rhetoric that finds scant treatment in the classical handbooks. Paul's reliance on arguments from Israel's scripture and his resort to the category of divinely revealed \"mystery\" (11:25) point us toward what Aristotle called \"inartificial\" proofs.57 Paul's invocation of sacred power-when he introduces himself as one called and set apart by God (1:1, 5, passim); when he declares that the power of God \"is being revealed\" in his proclamation (1:15) and that the justice and the wrath of God are likewise \"being revealed\" (1:16-18); his reference at the end of the letter to \"what Christ has accomplished in me in the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Holy Spirit\" (15:18-19)-similarly highlight a distinctive \"apodeictic\" aspect of his rhetoric, that is, his evocation of the divine \"proof\" or \"manifestation\" (apodeixis) of heavenly power. Paul explicitly characterizes his rhetoric to the Corinthian assembly in just these terms, as a \"demonstration [apodeixis] of spirit and power\" rather than reliance on persuasive (words) of wisdom\" (1 Cor 2:4).5859\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Because the classical handbooks presumed the power relationships of the established civic order, they provide no categories for describing rhetoric in tension with that order. Judicial rhetoric was the rhetoric of the law court, where the interests of the propertied class were inevitably served. Deliberative rhetoric was appropriate to the public assembly, from which those without property were excluded. Shame and honor, the themes of epideictic or ceremonial oratory similarly were defined by the ruling class, as Mark Reasoner and Robert Jewett have observed.60 Indeed, the handbooks assume that persuasive speech was a possibility only among the \"civilized.\" From the perspective of a master rhetorician like Cicero, the only language the rabble understood was force; 61 and the casual air with which Aristotle discussed the speaker's options regarding testimony torn from slaves under torture, to which he attributed no inherent evidentiary value whatsoever, similarly speaks volumes regarding  the relation the handbooks assume to exist between persuasion and coercion.62 We should not assume such resources will be of direct or uncomplicated assistance for our understanding of an \"invasive\" or disruptive rhetoric such as Paul's in Romans, a rhetoric that announces the revelation of \"God's wrath ... against the impiety and injustice of those who by their injustice suppress the truth,\" who although claiming to be wise, have been made fools by God's \"darkening\" of  their minds (Rom 1:18, 21-22).\n\nRomans as exhortation\n\nFinally, although the ancient rhetoricians occasionally recognized the phenomenon of exhortation by letter, it played no role in their discussions of formal public discourse. The hard-and-fast distinction made in the handbooks between epideictic rhetoric (ceremonia1 rhetoric, concerned with praise and blame) and deliberative (concerning advantageous and disadvantageous action) simply breaks down with regard to the genre of the hortatory or paraenetic letter.63 But that is exactly what Romans is. It is no coincidence that appeals to the han books often serve characterizations of the letter as a last will and testament, a think-piece, or a theological self-introduction. These readings necessarily minimize explicit statements of the letter's purpose in 1:11-15 and 15:14-16, and fail to recognize that Paul's diplomatic language in just those passages employs a well-known convention in Greco-Roman moral exhortation (see further chap. 1).\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Further, as Victor P. Furnish showed a generation ago, exhortation is not limited to a \"paraenetic section\" at the end of Romans, but gives structure to the argumentation of the whole letter. 64 The appeal in Romans 12 called hearers \"to a new life exactly opposite\" the life Paul had described in 1:18-32. That appeal was based on and recapitulated the language in Romans 6, where Paul's explicit subject was baptism into Christ.65 The whole of letter, Furnish concluded, was structured by a form of exhortation that was common in the early churches, a form that Rudolf Bultmann characterized as the \"formerly....but now\" scheme, which emphasized the change brought about by baptism from a former life to a new life. 66\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Most scholars concede that the letter explcitly addresses its recipients as from \"the nations\" (ta ethne: 1:6, 13 see 15:14-16). A minority of scholars have insisted, rightly, that the letter's argument must be read as directed to the explicitly named audience rather than by importing a supposed Judean opposition into the letter, however congenial such a maneuver may seem to Christian apologetics.67 The goal of rhetoric-critical interpretation of Romans should be to understand how the argumentation of the whole letter would have functioned to achieve the adherence of the explicitly named non-Judean audience. I have argued that case at length in an earlier work and will presume aspects of that argument here.68\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Scholars generally concede that the argumentation of Romans reaches an emotional climax in Romans 9-11, but often fail to follow through with the consequences of that observation. Nils Dahl demonstrated decades ago that the sorts of epistolary features that normally help us recognize the purpose of any other of Paul's letters are more evident in Roman 9-11, than m chapters 1-8. \"Attention to such details,\" Dahl concluded, \"shows that in Romans 9-11 Paul not only unfolds the theological theme of the letter as a whole, but also addresses the epistolary situation more directly than in most parts of Romans 1-8. 69 Instead, then, of reading the letter as a series of proofs of a thesis in 1: 16-17, we should recognize the overall structure of the letter as exhortation that reaches a climax in chapters 9-11 and is elaborated in chapters 12-15. It follows that chapters 1-8 should not be read as the doctrinal core of the letter, but as an argumentative preparation for the appeal in the later chapters that reaches its rhetorical climax in 9-11. Ben Witherington rightly describes the earlier chapters as constituting an extensive insinuatio, the \"subtle or indirect approach: recommended by the ancient rhetoricians in sltuation's in which the speaker's case was expected to be controversial or unpopular. It is not until Romans 9, Witherington remarks, that \"Paul has finally arrived at what has concerned him the most about the theological misunderstanding in Rome\"70\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 More precisely, Witherington declares that Romans provides \"a refutatio of Gentile misunderstandings about Jews and Jewish Christians.\" I hold (with Witherington) that those \"Gentile misunderstandings\" constitute not just one aspect of the situation addressed by Romans, but the primary exigence of the letter. Although majority of scholars continue to insist that at least one dominant purpose of the letter is to rebuke an inappropriate Jewish \"boast,\" represented either by Judeans among the Roman assemblies or by hostile Judean outsiders (in Rome, Jerusalem, elsewhere), I observe that Paul never addresses himself to actual Judeans in the course of the letter (see chap. 3 on the function of the diatribe in 2:17-24). To the contrary, Paul explicitly directs the climactic warning 11:13-34 to non-Judeans (hymin de lego tois ethnesin).\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The \"theological misunderstanding\" to which Witherington refers has been described by other interpreters as \"arrogance\" (J. Paul Sampley), \"nascent anti Judaism among the Roman Gentile Christians\" (William S. Campbell), or a \"local anti-Jewish sentiment\" tending toward \"proto-Marcionism\" (N. T. Wright).71 There is significant consensus that Romans addresses a specific situation, in the aftermath of Claudius's expulsion of Judeans from Rome in 49 and Nero's presumed rescript of that edict in 54, in which an ascendant majority of non-Judeans in the assemblies were in a position to look down on returning Judean exiles. Interpreting the evidence for this expulsion and its consequences will occupy part of chapter 3, where I also question to what extent this anti-Jewish animus is rooted in a distincly Christian theological perception. I suggest that the letter confronts both the \"boast\" of supremacy over Israel and, by necessity, the attitudes in the wider cultural environment that nourished that boast.72\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Here I point out that this consensus, and the attitude that it attributes to Paul's non-Judean hearers, militates against the common generalization that in RomansPaul seeks to legitimate the \"Gentile church.\"73 The non-Judeans addressed in Romans 11 are decidedly not individuals anxious about their standing before God and hungering for Paul's apostolic legitimation. We should resist the common presupposition that Romans involves a defense of the Gentile church against presumed Judean opposition; more, we should question why that presupposition remains so prevalent in the absence of any corroborative evidence in the letter.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Notes\n1.

I endorse Amy-Jill Levine's urgent protest that in the hands of some interpreters, translating \"ioudaios\" as Judean can mean sundering the connection between ancient Ioudaioi and modern Jews: see The Misunderstood Jew: The Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus (San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 2006), 164-6S and specifi,cally eschew those implications of the word Judean here.\n\n50. This was the burden of my argument in The Rhetoric of Romans.\n\n51. I have quoted George A.

Some measure of the breadth of this perception is the diversity of interpreters who profess it:  have quoted from Rudolf Bultmann, The Theology of the New Testament, vol. I (trans. Kendrick Grobel New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 19SO), 190;Juan Luis Segundo, The Humanist Christology of Paul, Jesus of Nazareth Yesterday and Today, vol. 3, trans.

The clear subordination of 1:16 to l:l5 (gar) and of 1:18 to 1:17 (gar) and the absence of any conventional indication that Paul is introducing a theme make this reading impossible: see Elliott, Rhetoric of Romans, 62-63; 8,~-83.Jewett declares as \"fully justified\" the consensus that 1:16-17 mark the thesis of the letter (Romans, 43) but offers no exegetical substantiation of that judgment.\n\n54. K.P. Donfried included Martin Luther Stirewalt's essay, \"The Form and Function of the Greek Letter-Essay,\" in the Romans Debate, 2nd ed.

But precisely the key indicators of the genre that Stirewalt discusses-a statement of topic (usually with the prepositional phrase peri ...., \"concerning ...\") and of the authors purpose in expounding his or her thought on the topic (usually, in response to a direct question)-are missing from Romans.\n\n55. Thus, for example, George A. Kennedy described the letter as \"more epideictic\" than 1 Thessalonians because he presumed that in Romans, Paul wished to show the Romans \"in advance what his gospel [would] be,\" and thus offered them \"an example of the kind of preaching or teaching he [would] practice when among them\" -a characterization of the letter in the subjunctive mood that Kennedy did not bother to defend, perhaps because he, like many other interpreters, regarded it as self-evident (Kennedy, New Testament Interpretation, 1S2, 156; similarly Aune, The New Testament in its Literary Environment, 219). Klaus Berger, on the other hand, labeled the letter an example of protreptic rhetoric, a subcategory of deliberative rhetoric cdhcerned with showing the advantages of adopting a particular way oflife, because (like Kennedy) he read Romans as a treatise on the superiority of the Christian \"way\" to Judaism (Klaus Berger, Formgeschichte des Neuen Testaments [Heidelberg: Quelle & Meyer, 1984)), 217-18. David Aune seeks to split the difference: \"Romans incorporates protreptic discourse into an epideictic letter\" (The New Testament in Its Literary Environment, 203). Robert Jewett regards the letter as epideictic because it exhibits aspects of parenetic and hortatory speeches (although these are regarded by other scholars as subcategories of deliberative rhetoric!) but subordinates these aspects to his characterization of Romans as an \"ambassadorial\" letter (Romans, 42-46), even though he recognizes that diplomatic\" rhetoric was a common mode for issuing commands in Roman discourse (726, on the parakalo clause at 12:1-2).\n\n56. Kennedy makes the point (regarding what he calls \"radical Christian rhetoric\") in New Testament Interpretation, 6-8; see also Amos Wilder, Early Christian Rhetoric: The Language of the Gospel (London: SCM, 1964).\n\n57. Arisrode, Rhetoric 1375a-77b.\n\n58. Philo similarly described the \"signs and wonders\" chat Moses displayed to Pharaoh's court as the apodeixis confirming the words of God to the Egyptians (On the Life of Moses 1.95): see BDAG s.v. Aristode names oracles as a sort ofinartificial proof (Rhetoric 1375b-76a), but shows no comparable sense of the active power of the god in the oracle; the oracle's meaning remains completely at\u2022the disposal of the speaker.\n\n59. Compare J. Louis Martyn's characterization of Paul's rhetoric in Galatians as a rhetoric of power: Paul wrote \"in the confidence that God intended to cause a certain event to occur\" when his letter was read. Paul does theology by writing in such a way as to anticipate a theological event he is the herald of a divine word \"that is at its heart invasive rather than responsive\" (\"Events in Galatia: Modified Covenantal Nomism versus God's Invasion of the Cosmos in the Singular G_gspel: A Response to J.

The genre of the admonitory letter was well established in Paul's day. Here is the description attributed to Demetrius of Phalerum (first century B.C.E.): \"'The admonishing type [of letter: nouthetike] is one which indicates through its name what its character is. For admonition is the\ninstilling of sense [noun tithein] in the person who is being admonished, and reaching him what should and should not be done\" (Pseudo-Demetrius, Epistolary Types). See Abraham Malherbe's translation, \"Ancient Epistolary Theorists,\" O]RS 5 (1977): 3-77; .Malherbe, Moral Exhortation: A Greco-Roman, Sourcebook (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1986), 81, and Stowers, Letter Writing, 125-26. Stowers points our that Paul's expression of confidence in the Romans is \"a rather typical ... assertion of the audience's lack of need for admonition which reflects the kinship between paraenesis and admonition\" (128).\n\n64. On the genre of paraenetic letter, see Abraham Malherbe, \"Exhortation in First Thessalonians,\" Novum Testamentum 25 (1983), 238-56. On the phenomenon of paraenesis and paraenetic style, see Aune, Literary Environment of the New Testament, 191.\n\n65. V. P. Furnish, Theology and Ethics in Paul (Nashville: Abingdon, 1968), 103, 105-6. See also Nils Dahl, \"Missionary Theology in the Episde to the Romans; in Studies in Paul: Theology for the Early Christian Mission (Minneapolis: Augsburg Press, 1977), 70-94.\n\n66.

See my further discussion in Rhetoric of Romans, 94-103. Dahl finds in Rom 15: 16, discussed above, a clear indication that Romans conforms to the wider pattern of Christian preaching, and of Paul's apostolic endeavor in general: \"he is rhe intercessor on behalf of his congregations who pleads their cause before God and he is the advisor who counsels them, in order co be able to present them to Christ at his coming, which Paul expected in the near future\" (\"Missionary Theology,\" 73).\n\n67. In The Rhetoric of Romans I followed Johannes Munck, Lloyd Gaston, and John G. Gager in arguing that Romans must be interpreted as an argument directed to the explicit addressees, non-Judeans (I wrote \"Gentiles\"). Both Stanley K. Stowers and Ben Witherington III subsequently made the same argument. Of course, this does not mean char there are no Judeans (Jews) in Paul's audience: the contrary is obviously the case, as the greetings in Romans 16 show. But Stowers insists that \"because Paul begins by explicidy describing his readers as gentiles, the interpreter can go step by step asking at what point the text introduces a new audience or subverts the explicit one\"; as he shows, there is in fact no such point in the letter. Stowers characterizes the contrary tendency among most interpreters; to insist that a Jewish-Christian minority is the direct target of much of the letter's argument, as an \"obsession\" chat leads interpreters co \"erase the gentile audience and replace it with 'Christians, both Jews and gentiles.'\" See Johannes Munck, Paul and the Salvation of Mankind (London: SCM, 1959); Lloyd Gaston, Paul and the Torah (Vancouver: University of British Columbia Press, 1987): John G. Gager, The Origins of Antisemitism (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985); Stanley K. Stowers, A Rereading of Romans, 29-36; Ben Witherington III, Paul's Letter to the Romans, l-8. Indeed, so powerful is this \"obsession\" that a few interpreters find it inconceivable that the letter should be read as it is addressed, that is, to non-Judeans. \"How,\" Philip F. Esler asks, \"can one seriously maintain that the letter was not addressed to ... Judeans? .. , Are we to suppose that very early in the reading ... these Judeans must have realized, and Paul intended chem to realize, that he only had non-Judean Christ-followers within the scope\u2022ofhis discourse and not them? ... Did they then sit or stand patiently for over an hour while the letter was read, all the while saying to themselves something like 'Very interesting, but of course Paul did nor intend chis teaching for us'?\" (Esler, Conflict and Identity in Romans, 119). Similarly, Steve Mason has written chat it \"strains the imagination\" that Paul would have intended the letter's discussion of \"typically Judaean questions\" co find \"any resonance with Gentile readers\" (Steve Mason, \"'For I Am Not .A\u00a7hamed of the Gospel' [Rom 1:16]: The Gospel and the First Readers of Romans,\" 254-87, in Gospel in Paul: Studies on Corinthians, Galatians, and Romans for Richard N. Longenecker, ed. L. Ann Jervis and Peter Richardson; JSNTSup 108 [Sheffield: Sheffield Academic, 1994], 258-59),To the contrary, what strains the imagination Js the suggestion that Paul would have expected the explicitly named addressees co sit out major sections of the letter without explaining that, or why, he was narrowing his focus to Judeans.\n\n68. Elliott, The Rhetoric of Romans.\n\n69. Nils Dahl. \"The Future of lsrael,\" in Studies in Paul, 139-42. Esler makes similar observatioqs: Conflict and Identity in Romans, 270-73.\n\n70. In Romans 1-8, Witherington writes, Paul \"reads carefully through, what could be called common ground\" before he \"comes to grips with a major issue\" in 9-11, \"following which in chaps. 12-15 he muse deal with the ethical fallout in Rome of the bad Theology he has confronted.\" The heart of the letter is long delayed because Paul docs not enjoy the clout in Rome that he had in his own churches; he \"must therefore follow the method known as insinuatio, nor dealing at first with what most disturbs him but building rapport with his audience\" (Witherington, Paul's Letter to the\nRomans, 17).\n\n71. W. S. Campbell, \"The Rule of Faith in Romans 12:1-15:13: The Obligation of Humble Obedience to Christ as the Only Adequate Response to the Mercies of God,\" in Pauline Theology Ill: Romans, 260-61; N. T. Wright, \"Romans and the Theology of Paul,\" ibid., 35.\n\n72. I will presume here many of the close rhetorical-critical arguments that I made in The Rhetoric of Romans.\n\n73. Jewett refers to a \"consensus\" regarding the historical situation of the letter (Romans, 3, 18-19).Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1197603", "artist_names":

child, it's a crowd, now\nPeople wanna dance\nPeople wanna dance\nEverybody wanna dance\nMove their bodies round\nWhile the music spins\nGet down\nGet down\nGet down\nYeah...\nBreak out!\n[Verse 2]\nFreak on the floor\nFreaks on the floor\nAll the freaks on the floor\nAll look starry-eyed\nDisco whistles blow\nStrange freaky vibes\nFlashing lights\nOf red, blue, yellow and green\nIt's a funky scene\nPlenty for the head\nCould only mean...\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's gonna be an all night thing\nIt's gonna be an all night thing\nBaby, it's an all night thing\nIt's gonna be an all night thing\nYeah, yes it is\nUh-huh\nBaby\n\n[Scat]\n\n[Verse 3]\nDig three-piece Slim-Jim movin' on in\nOn a chic freak\nCome on in\nNo, I can't blow\nSuch a hot piece\nShooga booga, honey, could ya?\nMove a little close\nClose enough for you to hear\nBaby, don't ya know?\nYou got me shifting in fifth gear\nYou look so fine, and\nI want your number in my book\nGonna take you home with me\nAnd get it on\nAll night long\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIt's gonna be an all night thing\nIt's gotta be an all night thing\nBaby, it's an all night thing\nIt's gonna be an all night thing\n\n[Outro]\nAll night
