ruins\nThat the weeds have overgrown\nYou may look in vain for crosses\nAnd you'll never see a one\nBut sometimes between the setting\nAnd the rising of the sun\nYou can hear a ghostly bugle\nAs the men go marchin' by\nYou can hear them as they answer\nTo that roll call in the sky\nColonel Travis, Davy Crockett\nAnd a hundred eighty more\nCaptain Dickinson, Jim Bowie\nPresent and accounted for\nBack in 1836, Houston said to Travis\n\"Get some volunteers and go\nFortify the Alamo\"\nWell the men came from Texas\nAnd from old Tennessee\nAnd they joined up with Travis\nJust to fight for the right to be free\nIndian scouts with squirrel guns\nMen with muzzle-loaders\nStood together, heel and toe\nTo defend the Alamo\n\n\"You may never see your loved ones\"\nTravis told them that day\n\"Those who want to can leave now\nThose who fight to the death let 'em stay\"\n\nIn the sand he drew the line\nWith his army sabre\nOut of a hundred eighty five\nNot a soldier crossed the line\nYou might also likeWith his banners a-dancin'\nIn the dawn's golden light\nSanta Anna came prancin'\nOn a horse that was black as the night\n\nSent an officer to tell\nTravis to surrender\nTravis answered with a shell\nAnd a rousin' rebel yell\n\nSanta Anna turned scarlet\n\"Play deg\u00fcello!\" he roared\n\"I will show them no quarter\nEveryone will be put to the sword!\"\n\nOne hundred and eighty five\nHoldin' back five thousand\nFive days, six days, eight days, ten\nTravis held and held again\n\nThen he sent for replacements\nFor his wounded and lame\nBut the troops that were comin'\nNever came, never came, never came\nTwice he charged then blew recall\nOn the fatal third time\nSanta Anna breached the wall\nAnd he killed them, one and all\nNow the bugles are silent\nAnd there's rust on each sword\nAnd the small band of soldiers\nLie asleep in the arms of the Lord\n\nIn the southern part of Texas\nNear the town of San Antone\nLike a statue on his pinto\nRides a cowboy all alone\n\nAnd he sees the cattle grazin'\nWhere a century before\nSanta Anna's guns were blazin'\nAnd the cannons used to roar\n\nAnd his eyes turn sorta misty\nAnd his heart begins to glow\nAnd he takes his hat off slowly\nTo the men of Alamo\n\nTo the thirteen days of glory\nAt the siege of Alamo1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

like he do when he's such a good man\n[Verse 1]\nHe's got me smiling when I should be ashamed\nGot me laughing when my heart is in pain\nOh no, I must be a fool\nBut I'll do anything he wants me to do\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're just a fool, you know you're in love\nYou've got to face it to live in this world\nYou take the good along with the bad\nSometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad\nYou know you love him, you can't understand\nWhy he treats you like he do when he's such a good man\n\n[Verse 2]\nWithout a man I don't wanna live\nYou think I'm lying but I'm telling you like it is\nHe's got my nose open and that's no lie\nAnd I, I'm gonna keep him satisfied\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're just a fool, you know you're in love\nYou've got to face it to live in this world\nYou take the good along with the bad\nSometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad\nYou know you love him, you can't understand\nWhy he treats you like he do when he's such a good man\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nWaves of action speaks louder than words\nThe truest thing that I ever heard\nI trust my man and all that he do\nAnd I, and I'll do anything he wants me to\n\n[Chorus]\nYou're just a fool, you know you're in love\nYou've got to face it to live in this world\nYou take the good along with the bad\nSometimes you're happy and sometimes you're sad\nYou know you love him, you can't understand\nWhy he treats you like he do when he's such a good manEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/922714", "artist_names": "Bobby Freeman", "full_title": "(I Do The) Shimmy Shimmy

He feared anew that they could never be happy together, even should she be free to choose him. She was accomplished; he was unrefined. It was the original difficulty, which he was too sensitive to recklessly ignore, as some men would have done in his place.\n\nHe was one of those silent, unobtrusive beings who want little from others in the way of favor or condescension, and perhaps on that very account scrutinize those others' behavior too closely. He was not versatile, but one in whom a hope or belief which had once had its rise, meridian, and decline seldom again exactly recurred, as in the breasts of more sanguine mortals. He had once worshipped her, laid out his life to suit her, wooed her, and lost her. Though it was with almost the same zest, it was with not quite the same hope, that he had begun to tread the old tracks again, and allowed himself to be so charmed with her that day.\n\nMove another step towards her he would not. He would even repulse her\u2014as a tribute to conscience. It would be sheer sin to let her prepare a pitfall for her happiness not much smaller than the first by inveigling her into a union with such as he. Her poor father was now blind to these subtleties, which he had formerly beheld as in noontide light. It was his own duty to declare them\u2014for her dear sake.\n\n\nGrace, too, had a very uncomfortable night, and her solicitous embarrassment was not lessened the next morning when another letter from her father was put into her hands. Its tenor was an intenser strain of the one that had preceded it. After stating how extremely glad he was to hear that she was better, and able to get out-of-doors, he went on:\n\n\u201cThis is a wearisome business, the solicitor we have come to see being out of town. I do not know when I shall get home. My great anxiety in this delay is still lest you should lose Giles Winterborne. I cannot rest at night for thinking that while our business is hanging fire he may become estranged, or go away from the neighborhood. I have set my heart upon seeing him your husband, if you ever have another. Do, then, Grace, give him some temporary encouragement, even though it is over-early. For when I consider the past I do think God will forgive me and you for being a little forward. I have another reason for this, my dear. I feel myself going rapidly downhill, and late affairs have still further helped me that way. And until this thing is done I cannot rest in peace.\u201d\nHe added a postscript:\n\n\u201cI have just heard that the solicitor is to be seen to-morrow. Possibly, therefore, I shall return in the evening after you get this.\u201d\n\n\nThe paternal longing ran on all fours with her own desire; and yet in forwarding it yesterday she had been on the brink of giving offence. While craving to be a country girl again just as her father requested; to put off the old Eve, the fastidious miss\u2014or rather madam\u2014completely, her first attempt had been beaten by the unexpected vitality of that fastidiousness. Her father on returning and seeing the trifling coolness of Giles would be sure to say that the same perversity which had led her to make difficulties about marrying Fitzpiers was now prompting her to blow hot and cold with poor Winterborne.\n\nIf the latter had been the most subtle hand at touching the stops of her delicate soul instead of one who had just bound himself to let her drift away from him again (if she would) on the wind of her estranging education, he could not have acted more seductively than he did that day. He chanced to be superintending some temporary work in a field opposite her windows. She could not discover what he was doing, but she read his mood keenly and truly: she could see in his coming and going an air of determined abandonment of the whole landscape that lay in her direction.\n\nOh, how she longed to make it up with him! Her father coming in the evening\u2014which meant, she supposed, that all formalities would be in train, her marriage virtually annulled, and she be free to be won again\u2014how could she look him in the face if he should see them estranged thus?\n\nIt was a fair green evening in June. She was seated in the garden, in the rustic chair which stood under the laurel-bushes\u2014made of peeled oak-branches that came to Melbury's premises as refuse after barking-time. The mass of full-juiced leafage on the heights around her was just swayed into faint gestures by a nearly spent wind which, even in its enfeebled state, did not reach her shelter. All day she had expected Giles to call\u2014to inquire how she had got home, or something or other; but he had not come. And he still tantalized her by going athwart and across that orchard opposite. She could see him as she sat.\n\nA slight diversion was presently created by Creedle bringing him a letter. She knew from this that Creedle had just come from Sherton, and had called as usual at the post-office for anything that had arrived by the afternoon post, of which there was no delivery at Hintock. She pondered on what the letter might contain\u2014particularly whether it were a second refresher for Winterborne from her father, like her own of the morning.\n\nBut it appeared to have no bearing upon herself whatever. Giles read its contents; and almost immediately turned away to a gap in the hedge of the orchard\u2014if that could be called a hedge which, owing to the drippings of the trees, was little more than a bank with a bush upon it here and there. He entered the plantation, and was no doubt going that way homeward to the mysterious hut he occupied on the other side of the woodland.\n\nThe sad sands were running swiftly through Time's glass; she had often felt it in these latter days; and, like Giles, she felt it doubly now after the solemn and pathetic reminder in her father's communication. Her freshness would pass, the long-suffering devotion of Giles might suddenly end\u2014might end that very hour. Men were so strange. The thought took away from her all her former reticence, and made her action bold. She started from her seat. If the little breach, quarrel, or whatever it might be called, of yesterday, was to be healed up it must be done by her on the instant. She crossed into the orchard, and clambered through the gap after Giles, just as he was diminishing to a faun-like figure under the green canopy and over the brown floor.\n\nGrace had been wrong\u2014very far wrong\u2014in assuming that the letter had no reference to herself because Giles had turned away into the wood after its perusal. It was, sad to say, because the missive had so much reference to herself that he had thus turned away. He feared that his grieved discomfiture might be observed. The letter was from Beaucock, written a few hours later than Melbury's to his daughter. It announced failure.\n\nGiles had once done that thriftless man a good turn, and now was the moment when Beaucock had chosen to remember it in his own way. During his absence in town with Melbury, the lawyer's clerk had naturally heard a great deal of the timber-merchant's family scheme of justice to Giles, and his communication was to inform Winterborne at the earliest possible moment that their attempt had failed, in order that the young man should not place himself in a false position towards Grace in the belief of its coming success. The news was, in sum, that Fitzpiers's conduct had not been sufficiently cruel to Grace to enable her to snap the bond. She was apparently doomed to be his wife till the end of the chapter.\n\nWinterborne quite forgot his superficial differences with the poor girl under the warm rush of deep and distracting love for her which the almost tragical information engendered.\n\nTo renounce her forever\u2014that was then the end of it for him, after all. There was no longer any question about suitability, or room for tiffs on petty tastes. The curtain had fallen again between them. She could not be his. The cruelty of their late revived hope was now terrible. How could they all have been so simple as to suppose this thing could be done?\nIt was at this moment that, hearing some one coming behind him, he turned and saw her hastening on between the thickets. He perceived in an instant that she did not know the blighting news.\n\n\u201cGiles, why didn't you come across to me?\u201d she asked, with arch reproach. \u201cDidn't you see me sitting there ever so long?\u201d\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d he said, in unprepared, extemporized tones, for her unexpected presence caught him without the slightest plan of behavior in the conjuncture. His manner made her think that she had been too chiding in her speech; and a mild scarlet wave passed over her as she resolved to soften it.\n\n\u201cI have had another letter from my father,\u201d she hastened to continue. \u201cHe thinks he may come home this evening. And\u2014in view of his hopes\u2014it will grieve him if there is any little difference between us, Giles.\u201d\n\u201cThere is none,\u201d he said, sadly regarding her from the face downward as he pondered how to lay the cruel truth bare.\n\n\u201cStill\u2014I fear you have not quite forgiven me about my being uncomfortable at the inn.\u201d\n\u201cI have, Grace, I'm sure.\u201d\n\u201cBut you speak in quite an unhappy way,\u201d she returned, coming up close to him with the most winning of the many pretty airs that appertained to her. \u201cDon't you think you will ever be happy, Giles?\u201d\n\nHe did not reply for some instants. \u201cWhen the sun shines on the north front of Sherton Abbey\u2014that's when my happiness will come to me!\u201d said he, staring as it were into the earth.\n\n\u201cBut\u2014then that means that there is something more than my offending you in not liking The Three Tuns. If it is because I\u2014did not like to let you kiss me in the Abbey\u2014well, you know, Giles, that it was not on account of my cold feelings, but because I did certainly, just then, think it was rather premature, in spite of my poor father. That was the true reason\u2014the sole one. But I do not want to be hard\u2014God knows I do not,\u201d she said, her voice fluctuating. \u201cAnd perhaps\u2014as I am on the verge of freedom\u2014I am not right, after all, in thinking there is any harm in your kissing me.\u201d\n\u201cOh God!\u201d said Winterborne within himself. His head was turned askance as he still resolutely regarded the ground. For the last several minutes he had seen this great temptation approaching him in regular siege; and now it had come. The wrong, the social sin, of now taking advantage of the offer of her lips had a magnitude, in the eyes of one whose life had been so primitive, so ruled by purest household laws, as Giles's, which can hardly be explained.\n\n\u201cDid you say anything?\u201d she asked, timidly.\n\n\u201cOh no\u2014only that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that it must BE settled, since my father is coming home?\u201d she said, gladly.\n\nWinterborne, though fighting valiantly against himself all this while\u2014though he would have protected Grace's good repute as the apple of his eye\u2014was a man; and, as Desdemona said, men are not gods. In face of the agonizing seductiveness shown by her, in her unenlightened school-girl simplicity about the laws and ordinances, he betrayed a man's weakness. Since it was so\u2014since it had come to this, that Grace, deeming herself free to do it, was virtually asking him to demonstrate that he loved her\u2014since he could demonstrate it only too truly\u2014since life was short and love was strong\u2014he gave way to the temptation, notwithstanding that he perfectly well knew her to be wedded irrevocably to Fitzpiers. Indeed, he cared for nothing past or future, simply accepting the present and what it brought, desiring once in his life to clasp in his arms her he had watched over and loved so long.\n\nShe started back suddenly from his embrace, influenced by a sort of inspiration. \u201cOh, I suppose,\u201d she stammered, \u201cthat I am really free?\u2014that this is right? Is there REALLY a new law? Father cannot have been too sanguine in saying\u2014\u201d\n\nHe did not answer, and a moment afterwards Grace burst into tears in spite of herself. \u201cOh, why does not my father come home and explain,\u201d she sobbed, \u201cand let me know clearly what I am? It is too trying, this, to ask me to\u2014and then to leave me so long in so vague a state that I do not know what to do, and perhaps do wrong!\u201d\n\nWinterborne felt like a very Cain, over and above his previous sorrow. How he had sinned against her in not telling her what he knew. He turned aside; the feeling of his cruelty mounted higher and higher. How could he have dreamed of kissing her? He could hardly refrain from tears. Surely nothing more pitiable had ever been known than the condition of this poor young thing, now as heretofore the victim of her father's well-meant but blundering policy.\n\nEven in the hour of Melbury's greatest assurance Winterborne had harbored a suspicion that no law, new or old, could undo Grace's marriage without her appearance in public; though he was not sufficiently sure of what might have been enacted to destroy by his own words her pleasing idea that a mere dash of the pen, on her father's testimony, was going to be sufficient. But he had never suspected the sad fact that the position was irremediable.\n\nPoor Grace, perhaps feeling that she had indulged in too much fluster for a mere kiss, calmed herself at finding how grave he was. \u201cI am glad we are friends again anyhow,\u201d she said, smiling through her tears. \u201cGiles, if you had only shown half the boldness before I married that you show now, you would have carried me off for your own first instead of second. If we do marry, I hope you will never think badly of me for encouraging you a little, but my father is SO impatient, you know, as his years and infirmities increase, that he will wish to see us a little advanced when he comes. That is my only excuse.\u201d\n\nTo Winterborne all this was sadder than it was sweet. How could she so trust her father's conjectures? He did not know how to tell her the truth and shame himself. And yet he felt that it must be done. \u201cWe may have been wrong,\u201d he began, almost fearfully, \u201cin supposing that it can all be carried out while we stay here at Hintock. I am not sure but that people may have to appear in a public court even under the new Act; and if there should be any difficulty, and we cannot marry after all\u2014\u201d\n\nHer cheeks became slowly bloodless. \u201cOh, Giles,\u201d she said, grasping his arm, \u201cyou have heard something! What\u2014cannot my father conclude it there and now? Surely he has done it? Oh, Giles, Giles, don't deceive me. What terrible position am I in?\u201d\n\nHe could not tell her, try as he would. The sense of her implicit trust in his honor absolutely disabled him. \u201cI cannot inform you,\u201d he murmured, his voice as husky as that of the leaves underfoot. \u201cYour father will soon be here. Then we shall know. I will take you home.\u201d\n\nInexpressibly dear as she was to him, he offered her his arm with the most reserved air, as he added, correctingly, \u201cI will take you, at any rate, into the drive.\u201d\n\nThus they walked on together. Grace vibrating between happiness and misgiving. It was only a few minutes' walk to where the drive ran, and they had hardly descended into it when they heard a voice behind them cry, \u201cTake out that arm!\u201d\n\nFor a moment they did not heed, and the voice repeated, more loudly and hoarsely,\n\n\u201cTake out that arm!\u201d\n\nIt was Melbury's. He had returned sooner than they expected, and now came up to them. Grace's hand had been withdrawn like lightning on her hearing the second command. \u201cI don't blame you\u2014I don't blame you,\u201d he said, in the weary cadence of one broken down with scourgings. \u201cBut you two must walk together no more\u2014I have been surprised\u2014I have been cruelly deceived\u2014Giles, don't say anything to me; but go away!\u201d\n\nHe was evidently not aware that Winterborne had known the truth before he brought it; and Giles would not stay to discuss it with him then. When the young man had gone Melbury took his daughter in-doors to the room he used as his office. There he sat down, and bent over the slope of the bureau, her bewildered gaze fixed upon him.\n\nWhen Melbury had recovered a little he said, \u201cYou are now, as ever, Fitzpiers's wife. I was deluded. He has not done you ENOUGH harm. You are still subject to his beck and call.\u201d\n\u201cThen let it be, and never mind, father,\u201d she said, with dignified sorrow. \u201cI can bear it. It is your trouble that grieves me most.\u201d She stooped over him, and put her arm round his neck, which distressed Melbury still more. \u201cI don't mind at all what comes to me,\u201d Grace continued; \u201cwhose wife I am, or whose I am not. I do love Giles; I cannot help that; and I have gone further with him than I should have done if I had known exactly how things were. But I do not reproach you.\u201d\n\u201cThen Giles did not tell you?\u201d said Melbury.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said she. \u201cHe could not have known it. His behavior to me proved that he did not know.\u201d\n\nHer father said nothing more, and Grace went away to the solitude of her chamber.\n\nHer heavy disquietude had many shapes; and for a time she put aside the dominant fact to think of her too free conduct towards Giles. His love-making had been brief as it was sweet; but would he on reflection contemn her for forwardness? How could she have been so simple as to suppose she was in a position to behave as she had done! Thus she mentally blamed her ignorance; and yet in the centre of her heart she blessed it a little for what it had momentarily brought her.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1800169", "artist_names": "Hossein Amini", "full_title": "Drive by\u00a0Hossein\u00a0Amini", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "id": 1800169, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1637495, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1431560501, "path": "/Hossein-amini-drive-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Hossein-amini-drive-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "song_art_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669754445", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Drive", "title_with_featured": "Drive", "updated_by_human_at": 1431560499, "url": "https://genius.com/Hossein-amini-drive-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/402797", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669754445", "id": 402797, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669754445", "index_character": "h", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Hossein Amini", "slug": "Hossein-amini", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Hossein-amini"}, "artist": "Hossein Amini", "lyrics": "Drive LyricsDRIVE\n\n\n\nWritten by\n\nHossein Amini\n\n\n\nBased on the novel by\n\nJames Sallis\n\n\n\n\n09.24.10\n\n1 INT. CAR ENGINE - NIGHT. 1\n\nWe're close on a maze of metal rods, tubes, and wires. It's only\nas we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over\nthe image we hear a voice talking on a phone.\n\nDRIVER O/S\n...hundred thousand streets in this city,\nyou don't need to know the route. You give\nme a time and place, I give you a five\nminute window. Those five minutes I'm\nyours. Whatever goes down I'm yours. Minute\neither side you're on your own...\n\nAs the engine ignites and roars to life we DISSOLVE TO:\n\n2 INT. LOW RENT APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN/ L.A. - NIGHT. 2\nA map of downtown L.A. spread out on a bed, dozens of different\nroutes marked in pencil. The voice continues -\n\nDRIVER O/S\n...One last thing. You won't be able to\nreach me at this number again...\n\nDRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it\nin his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly\npacked inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a\ncheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA\nClippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks.\n\n3 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ KOREATOWN - NIGHT. 3\n\nDriver strides through a dimly lit car park, carrying his duffel\nbag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night\nout. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his\nway towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle\n\n4 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ALVARADO - NIGHT. 4\n\nThe Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is\nonly half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the\npassing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes.\nSomething almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives\ncarefully, letting other cars overtake.\n5 EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 5\n\nDriver glides into the parking lot of another low-rent apartment\nblock.\n2\n9/24/10\n\n\n\n\n6 INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 6\n\nClutching his duffel bag Driver heads towards the car park\nelevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a\npretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes\nmeet briefly, before Driver walks on.\n\n7 INT. APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 7\n\nDriver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new\napartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean,\nsparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He\ntosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again.\n\n8 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT 8\n\nDriver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on\nthe radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food\nshacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage\nlit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse -\nvintage cars.\n\n9 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 9\n\nSHANNON, the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp. Driver\nfollows him past rows of vintage cars.\n\nSHANNON\n...Plain Jane cheap like you asked for but\nwith a hundred and sixty horsepower inside.\nYou get any sleep?\n\nDRIVER\nNot this week.\n\nAs Shannon grins we feel the familiarity between them.\n\nSHANNON\nI can offer you some Halcyon.\n\nDRIVER\nWon't work.\n\nThey head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they\narrive at a plain looking Impala.\n\nSHANNON\nThere she is. Silver Impala. Most popular\ncar in the state of California...\n\nDriver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds\nout his hand for the keys.\n3\n9/24/10\n\n\n\n\n10 INT/EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ TOY DISTRICT/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 10\n\nThe basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter.\nDriver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows\nof dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's\n9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street.\n\n11 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ ELECTRONICS SUPERSTORE/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 11\n\nA vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street.\nUnder the pale yellow glow of the street lamps, Driver sees\nsigns advertising a `huge blow out weekend sale'. He pulls over,\nmaking sure he has a good view of the entrance. On the radio,\nthe basketball commentator is getting more excited.\n\nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY\n...This is some comeback from the Clippers!\nOnly a few minutes ago they looked dead and\nburied!...\n\nDriver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld\nscanner. He switches it on, tuning it to the right frequency.\nCrackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball\ncommentary now.\n\nPOLICE SCANNER\n...9 Adam 81, what is your current\nlocation?...Repeat, what is your current\nlocation?...\n\nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY\n...Another unbelievable three pointer from\nDavis and the Clippers are within five!...\n\nOut of the corner of his eye Driver sees two MEN approach. He\ndoesn't react, expecting them. They cut through the fence with\nbolt cutters and approach the main building. Driver watches them\npull on their masks, then one of them takes out a shotgun and\nblasts the lock to the front door. Instantly the alarm shrills.\nThe only thing Driver does is to turn on his stop watch.\n\nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY\n...Time out Knicks...\n\nThe stop watching keeps ticking away, the siren blaring, the\ncommentary continuing, the police scanner crackling.\n\nThe storefront is hidden in shadow, impossible to tell what's\ngoing on inside. Driver looks at his stop watch. Almost three\nminutes. One of the masked men emerges now, carrying a duffel\nbag. He hurries over and gets in the back of Driver's car\nwithout a word. There's no sign of the other robber.\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n4\n9/24/10\n11 CONTINUED: 11\n\nThe commentary continues, so does the crackling on the police\nscanner. Four minutes. Still no sign of the second armed robber.\nHis companion in the back starts to look nervous, wondering\nwhat's happened to his partner.\n\nDriver doesn't betray a hint of nerves. Four and half minutes on\nhis stop watch. Thirty seconds more and he's on his way.\n\nSuddenly the second robber appears from the shadows, running as\nfast as he can to the getaway car. He jumps into the back seat a\nfew seconds short of five minutes and Driver screeches off.\n\n12 INT/ EXT. SILVER IMPALA/ STREETS/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 12\n\nDriver thunders over the 1st Street bridge towards Boyle\nHeights, then eases his foot off the gas, slowing to a steady\nspeed. In the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their\nmasks, looking pumped up with adrenalin. Driver studies them in\nhis rear view mirror, then swerves right on Mission Street as\nhis police scanner crackles to life.\n\nPOLICE SCANNER\n...Attention all units...211...Superstore\non Traction Avenue...Suspects headed\nEastbound on 1st Street...Driving a Silver\nImpala...\n\nDriver swings sharply into 4th Street now, crossing the L.A.\nRiver again, heading back in the same direction he came.\n\nPOLICE SCANNER\n...Airships dispatched...Downtown and Boyle\nHeights...All units standby. Repeat, all\nunits standby...\n\nUp ahead, the lights of Downtown L.A. glitter against the night\nsky. Hovering between the neon green glow of the skyscrapers\nDriver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter. He\nswitches off his headlights, turning left on Santa Fe Avenue.\n\n13 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ALLEYWAYS/INDUSTRIAL AREA/DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 13\n\nThe armed robbers watch in tense silence as Driver weaves in and\nout of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off.\nIt's as if he's trying to find his way out of the maze or\nprobing to see if there's anyone out there.\n\nPOLICE SCANNER\n...1 Baker 11, headed south on Boyle\nAvenue...No sign of suspects...Repeat, no\nsign of suspects...\n\nThe armed robbers look relieved when suddenly a police car\nglides past at the end of the alleyway, its lights also off.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n5\n9/24/10\n13 CONTINUED: 13\n\nIt's like catching a glimpse of a passing shark's fin. Driver\ntaps the brakes gently, his car sliding to a stop. He stays\nthere a moment, then eases the Impala forward, turning in the\nsame direction as the black-and-white.\n\n14 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 14\n\nIt's a high-risk strategy but Driver follows the black-and-white\nat a distance, hidden in the darkness, knowing other squad cars\nwon't be checking the same route. The police car makes its way\nthrough the dimly lit industrial zone, unaware it's being\nshadowed. Driver turns his car radio up a whisper.\n\nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY\n...And for the first time in the game the\nClippers have the lead. 71 to 69. Seven to\ngo in the Fourth here at the Staples\nCentre...\n\nDriver turns the sound back down. Up ahead, the police car\nswings left, disappearing from view. Driver slows down too,\nanticipating the next obstacle. He doesn't have long to wait. In\nthe distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police\nchopper's search-lights, sweeping the area one more time.\n\nDriver floors the gas, speeding straight towards the approaching\nhelicopter. The armed robbers are too stunned to protest. They\njust sit there, watching the sweeping searchlights getting\ncloser and closer.\n\nThen suddenly it becomes clear what Driver's doing. Up ahead,\nthere's a small underpass below the 7th Street bridge. Driver\nslides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the\nchopper's searchlights spot them.\n\n15 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ UNDERPASS/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA - NIGHT.15\n\nThe roar of the helicopter thunders overhead. The underpass is\ncrammed with dirty mattresses and shopping carts. Sleeping HOBOS\ncan be seen under dirty blankets. Driver waits for the echo of\nthe helicopter to fade, then moves forward again.\n\n16 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ OLYMPIC BOULEVARD/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 16\n\nGloomy yellow street-lamps shine down on the industrial zone.\nRows of delivery trucks are parked outside the meat-packing\nfactories. Driver cruises cautiously down the deserted street.\nThe crackling of the police scanner and the droning of the\nbasketball commentary add to the tension. Finally up ahead he\nsees car-lights streaming back and forth on Broadway.\n\nDRIVER\nGet down...\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n6\n9/24/10\n16 CONTINUED: 16\n\nThe armed robbers lie flat on the back seat, paying Driver more\nrespect now.\n\n17 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 17\n\nThere's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway. Driver falls in\nbehind the other cars. On the radio, the basketball game is\nstill playing.\n\nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY\n...Three thirteen left on the clock.\nDunleavy calls a time out and it's the\nClippers by one...\n\nThe passing head-lamps light up Driver's face. There's not a\ntrace of emotion in his eyes -- even when he spots a patrol car\napproaching in the opposite direction.\n\nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY\n...Buckle up your seat belts Clippers fans.\nThis game really is too close to call...\n\nThe two cars pass each other slowly. Driver sees the cops in the\nBlack-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past. He\nturns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner.\n\nPOLICE SCANNER\n...This is 1 David 16...Silver Impala\nheaded South on Broadway and\nPico...Couldn't get a look at her license\nplates...Appears to be only one occupant...\n\nIn the back seat, the armed robbers wait nervously for the\npolice dispatch to respond.\n\nPOLICE SCANNER\n...1 David 16...why don't you check her\nout...\n\nAs soon as he hears this Driver swerves sharply into the next\nstreet.\n\n18 INT/ EXT. IMPALA/ SIDESTREET OFF BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 18\n\nDriver guns around the block now, building up speed.\n\nPOLICE SCANNER\n...This is 1 David 16...We lost the suspect\nsomewhere between Broadway and\nGrand...Possible evasive action...Request\nairship and additional units...\n7\n9/24/10\n\n\n\n\n19 INT/ EXT. IMPALA/ WEST PICO BOULEVARD/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 19\n\nDriver bursts out onto Pico now. A squad car headed in the\nopposite direction slows down as it sees him but is caught up in\nthe flow of traffic, unable to turn round and give chase.\n\nPOLICE SCANNER\n...1 David 11...suspect headed West on\nPico...\n\nDriver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him, so\nsmooth and effortless it's hard to tell how fast he's going. He\nglances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper\noverhead. The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging\nits search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position.\n\nDriver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way\nof outrunning the chopper. Blue light floods the asphalt around\nhim as he guns down Figueroa.\n\nPOLICE SCANNER\nAll units...pursuit in progress...silver\nImpala...Headed North on Figueroa...\n\nEven now Driver doesn't panic, turning his attention back to the\nbasketball game.\n\nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY\nThornton pulls up from behind the arc,\nmisses. Rebound New York. One eighteen to\nplay...\n\nDriver swerves sharply towards the sparkling lights of the\nStaples Centre.\n\n20 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ STAPLES CENTRE/ PARKING LOT - NIGHT. 20\n\nThe terraced parking lot looms up ahead. A sign above the\nbarrier says `Season Ticket Holders Only'. Driver punches in a\nticket and roars into the parking lot.\n\n21 INT. IMPALA/ STAPLES CENTRE PARKING LOT - NIGHT. 21\n\nThe Impala screeches from one level to the next. With a game\ngoing on, the parking lot is almost full. Finally Driver pulls\ninto a free parking space.\n\nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY\n...Thirty seconds remaining and all the\nKnicks have to do is run out the clock...\n\nDriver glances in his side mirror. Behind him, dozens of FANS\nare already streaming out into the parking lot before the game\nis over, hoping to avoid the inevitable traffic.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n8\n9/24/10\n21 CONTINUED: 21\n\nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY\n...Gordon back to Davis...Davis for\nthree...This is unbelievable!...\n\nThe jubilant commentary continues, but Driver isn't listening\nanymore. The game has served its purpose. More fans flood into\nthe parking lot. Dozens of cars pull out of their places.\n\nBASKETBALL COMMENTARY\n...What a remarkable comeback...Outplayed\nfor most of the game, the Clippers have\nshown incredible resilience...\n\nDriver glances at the armed robbers and nods. It's time. They\nclimb out of the car, merging in with the crowd. Driver watches\nthem disappear, then slips on a Clippers cap, climbs out of the\nImpala himself and heads towards another car.\n\n22 EXT. STAPLES CENTRE/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 22\n\nOutside the parking lot, the police are waiting, stopping\nanything that looks like an Impala, shining their flashlights\ninto the windows. Wearing his Clippers cap and a Clippers\nsticker on his new car, Driver calmly drives past them, making\nhis getaway.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n23 EXT. FILM SET/ SAN PEDRO/ LOS ANGELES - DAY. 23\n\nDriver's face is fixed ahead, sunglasses hiding his eyes. As we\nPULL OUT we see to our surprise that he's wearing a policeman's\nuniform. It's only as we pull out further that we see several\nother `POLICE OFFICERS' sitting in the same fold up chairs,\nreading car magazines and scripts as they're powdered by MAKE-UP\nGIRLS, and realize we're on a movie set.\n\nDriver glances up from his script and sees another STUNTMAN\nbeing fitted with an SFX mask. The stuntman now looks identical\nto the STAR of the movie who stands nearby.\n\nASSISTANT DIRECTOR O/S\nI need you guys to sign this contract...\n\nDriver takes the form along with all the other stuntmen and\nsigns it without a glance.\n\n24 EXT. FILM SET/ SAN PEDRO/ LOS ANGELES - DAY. 24\n\nShannon is discussing a car stunt with another AD, using two toy\ncars on the hood of a cop car to demonstrate the danger.\n\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n9\n9/24/10\n24 CONTINUED: 24\n\nSHANNON\n...This is a whole new thing. He taps the\nfender any faster than fifty not only will\nshe roll, she'll roll all the way to Baja.\n\nDriver heads off, disinterested in the negotiations.\n\nSHANNON\nA high risk stunt like that's worth at\nleast a thousand five.\n\nAD\nThey won't go higher than a thousand.\n\nSHANNON\nDone.\n\nFor all his charm we sense something of the hustler about\nShannon.\n\n25 EXT. CRAFT TABLE/ FILM SET/ SAN PEDRO/ LOS ANGELES - DAY. 25\n\nDriver approaches a buffet table laid out with food. He's about\nto help himself when JACK, the caterer, stops him.\n\nJACK\nSorry, that's for the director...\n\n26 INT/ EXT. POLICE CAR/ FILM SET/ SAN PEDRO - DAY. 26\n\nDriver sits at the wheel of the Black-and-White while a STUNT\nSUPERVISOR checks his harness. Shannon leans into the window\nwith a smile.\n\nSHANNON\nI managed to get them up to five hundred.\n\nDriver doesn't seem to care, focussed on the job.\n\n2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S\nCamera ready, sound ready...\n\nShannon joins the rest of the crew, looking on.\n\n2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S\n...ACTION!...\n\nDriver floors the gas, screeching out of the alleyway. He\nswerves between several oil drums then straightens up on the\nmain road.\n\nIn his rear view mirror he sees a black Dodge Charger appear on\ncue, bearing down on him.\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n10\n9/24/10\n26 CONTINUED: 26\n\nDriver slows to forty, like he's supposed to, but the black\nCharger keeps coming at speed.\n\nDriver's eyes stay fixed on his rear view mirror, judging the\nother car's speed and angle of approach to perfection.\n\nThe Charger slams into the back of Driver's car at sixty miles\nan hour, hitting him just above the left rear wheel.\n\nDriver's reactions are quick as lightning, counter-steering as\nhis Black-and-White goes careening off the road. He keeps the\ncar upright long enough to slow it down before it finally flips\nend over end.\n\nUp ahead, the Charger skids to a showy stop.\n\n2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S\n...And CUT!...\n\nSome clapping and cheering breaks out, but most the crew\ncouldn't care less, returning to their cell-phones and shot\nlists. Only Shannon seems interested in Driver, limping over and\nhelping him out of his battered Black-and-White.\n\nSHANNON\nNice work, officer...\n\nDriver spits out some fake candyglass from the shattered\nwindscreen.\n\n27 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA/ WESTWOOD - DAY. 27\n\nA New York style pizza-by-the-slice restaurant. A WAITER takes a\ndelivery of Chinese food at the door and carries it over to a\ntable where Shannon is sitting with an old friend, BERNIE ROSE.\n\nWAITER\nHere you go, Mr. Rose.\n(Taking out the white boxes)\nEgg rolls, chicken chow mein, five flavor\nshrimp and Peking duck.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nDid they remember the chop sticks?\n\nWAITER\nDoesn't look like it, sir. Let me run and\nget the guy.\n\nFrom the way the waiter hurries off we get a sense of Bernie's\npower and authority. He turns back to Shannon, resuming their\nconversation.\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n11\n9/24/10\n27 CONTINUED: 27\n\nBERNIE ROSE\n...You run a perfectly good business. Why\nwould you want to change now?\n\nSHANNON\nYou know how much my business made last\nyear? Thirty Grand. Takes me six months to\nbuild a car and a couple of seconds for\nthese jerks to write it off on a stunt that\ndoesn't even make it into the movie.\n\nBernie shakes his head but clearly has a soft spot for Shannon.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nHow much do you need?\n\nSHANNON\nLet me talk you through it first.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nThat sounds like a lot.\n\nSHANNON\nDoesn't have to be. The big money teams\nburn through three, four million a year but\nthat's `cause they're using half a dozen\ntest drivers and a stable of cars.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nI don't know anything about car racing but\nI assume there's a reason for that?\n\nSHANNON\nSure, but it's not the only way. All I need\nis a hard-used stock car. We start off with\nthe small-town action then work our way up.\nThere's close to two thousand events out\nthere and once we make the Show we're\ntalking millions.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\n`Millions'?\n\nSHANNON\nThere's a fortune to be made. Sponsorship.\nTV deals. We'll even name the team after\nyou.\n\nBernie looks at his friend in mild exasperation then turns away\nas the waiter returns with a handful of chop sticks.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nThank you, Ron. You sure you don't want any\nof this?\n\n(CONTINUED)\n12\n9/24/10\n27 CONTINUED: (2) 27\n\nSHANNON\nNo, thanks.\n\nBernie waits for the waiter to leave then continues.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYou still haven't given me a number?\n\nShannon hesitates but only for a second.\n\nSHANNON\nFour hundred and thirty thousand dollars.\n\nBernie Rose can't help grinning at his nerve.\n\nSHANNON\nLook, I wouldn't come to you unless I was\nsure about this.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nCome on, Shannon. How can you be sure? What\nhave you got these big money teams don't\nhave?\n\nSHANNON\nI got a driver.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nAnd they got half a dozen Drivers you told\nme.\n\nSHANNON\nNot like this one.\n\nHe stares at his friend with quiet conviction.\n\nSHANNON\nI been working with this guy a long time -\nI've never seen anything like it. I had the\nmoney I'd back him myself...\n\nBernie Rose considers him quietly.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nBut you don't have the money.\n\nSHANNON\nEverything I own is in metal. I had to sell\nmy Bullit car the other day just to pay the\ngas bill. I'm telling you, Bernie, put this\nkid behind a wheel there's nothing he can't\ndo.\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n13\n9/24/10\n27 CONTINUED: (3) 27\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nAnd what happens to my money if this kid\ngets hit by a bus?\n\nShannon's about to reply when they're interrupted by a big bull\nof a man with a gruff voice.\n\nNINO\nWhat are you doing eating Chink food in my\nrestaurant?\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nWhat's a Jew doing running a Pizzeria?\nWorst fucking pizza in LA by the way. How\nhard is it to bake a loaf of bread?\n\nNINO\nIt's the fucking water in this city...\n\nShannon smiles, intimidated by Nino, giving up his seat\nrespectfully. Nino doesn't even acknowledge him.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nI thought you were supposed to be out of\ntown anyway?\n\nNINO\nWell, I'm back.\n(Barely a glance at Shannon)\nTake a hike. I need to talk to my partner.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nBe polite, Nino. I invited him here.\n\nNINO\nOh, I'm sorry. How you doing, Shannon?\nHow's the fucking leg?\n\nBernie senses things are only going to get worse and dismisses\nShannon gently.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nI'll think about it but I want to meet your\nguy first...\n\n28 INT. ELEVATOR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 28\n\nDriver stands in the elevator as it climbs slowly. It reaches\nthe ground floor then the doors slide open. Driver finds himself\nface to face with the pretty girl he saw the other night. She\nlooks a little startled to see him, then recovers\n\nPRETTY GIRL (IRENE)\nHi...\n\n(CONTINUED)\n14\n9/24/10\n28 CONTINUED: 28\n\nShe joins him in the elevator, carrying a grocery bag with some\nmilk and Fruit Loops cereal.\n\nDRIVER\nWhich floor, ma'am?...\n\nIRENE\nFourth please...\n\nDriver presses the fourth floor button even though it's already\nlit. The doors shut and the elevator starts to climb. Driver\nstares out quietly. Irene takes a glance at him, feeling awkward\nin the silence. She looks relieved as the elevator doors finally\nopen. Driver steps aside to let her out first.\n\nIRENE\nThank you...\n\n29 INT. CORRIDOR/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - MORNING. 29\n\nDriver and Irene walk down the corridor in the same direction,\nonly a few feet apart. She seems more aware of his presence than\nhe is of hers. She reaches the door to her apartment first.\n\nIRENE\nGoodbye...\n\nDRIVER\nGoodbye, ma'am...\n\nDriver looks at her just long enough not to seem impolite, then\ncontinues down the corridor, not even glancing back.\n\n30 EXT. SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY. 30\n\nBright sunlight. In the distance we see a trail of dust moving\nacross the flatland. Everything is silent, then slowly the hum\nof an engine rises as the stock car turns towards us. It\nshimmers in the heat waves, the noise of its engine getting\nlouder as it picks up speed.\n\nShannon stands with his friend Bernie Rose at the edge of the\nmakeshift track, staring at the glittering car with its colorful\nsignage advertising everything from Snickers to Cheerios.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nLooks like a chocolate bar. You're gonna\nhave to tell me if that's fast or slow\n`cause I got no idea...\n\nShannon smiles to himself.\n\nSHANNON\nIt ain't slow...\n15\n9/24/10\n\n\n\n\n31 INT. RACE CAR/ SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY. 31\n\nEven in the cramped space of the roll cage there's something\neffortless about the way Driver controls the car. His eyes are\nfixed in concentration, his body tensing only slightly as he\nlifts his foot off the gas and turns the wheel.\n\n32 EXT. SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY. 32\n\nThe glinting vehicle is lost in a cloud of dust, then reappears\nagain, moving even faster now. The STOCK CAR'S OWNER, a bearded\nhot-rodder with a t-shirt that says, \"Drive it like you stole\nit\", joins Shannon with a confident smile.\n\nSTOCK CAR OWNER\nTold you she was a beauty...\n\nSHANNON\n(Playing hard to get)\nMaybe where you come from...\n\nBernie Rose pays no attention to their banter, his eyes fixed\nthoughtfully on the stock car as it finally slows to a stop.\n\n33 EXT. RACE CAR/ SAUGUS SPEEDWAY - DAY. 33\n\nDriver climbs out of the car. As he looks up he sees Shannon\nlimping over with the stock car's owner, a couple of MECHANICS,\nand Bernie Rose.\n\nSHANNON\nLooks a little long in the tooth to me.\nThink we should take her home?...\n\nDriver shrugs. Shannon grins, turning to Bernie now.\n\nSHANNON\nBernie, this is the driver I been telling\nyou about...\n\nOne look at Bernie Rose and Driver senses the power and\nauthority behind his deceptively gentle eyes.\n\nSHANNON\nBernie's thinking of investing in our race\nteam...\n\nThe old mobster holds out his hand, meeting Driver's gaze.\n\nDRIVER\nMy hands are a little dirty.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nDon't worry. So are mine...\n\n(CONTINUED)\n16\n9/24/10\n33 CONTINUED: 33\n\nHe gives Driver a big grin and a warm handshake, sizing him up.\nDriver smiles politely, gazing back at him. The stock car's\nowner interrupts the moment between them, holding a stopwatch.\n\nSTOCK CAR OWNER\nCouldn't see much wrong with that. You beat\nthe fastest lap by more than half a second.\n\nDRIVER\nYou might wanna take a look at the\nsuspension before we go again.\n(Turning back to Bernie)\nNice to meet you...\n\nBernie's still studying him.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYou too...\n\nTheir eyes stay on each other, then Driver follows the stock car\nowner and his mechanics back to the car. Bernie Rose stares\nafter him quietly, thinking to himself. Shannon can feel he's\ngetting interested.\n\nSHANNON\nYou gonna give me the four?\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nI'll give you three for seventy percent...\n\n34 INT. SUPERMARKET/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 34\n\nTinny supermarket music plays in the background. Driver walks\npast the vast selection of instant coffee brands, bemused by the\nchoice. Suddenly he notices something out of the corner of his\neye. At the far end of the aisle his pretty neighbor, Irene, is\nbrowsing through the confectionery section. Standing next to her\nis a young boy of six or seven, (BENICIO). He grabs a multi-pack\nof snickers and puts it in Irene's shopping basket. Irene calmly\npicks it out, replaces it on the shelf, and takes a single\nsnicker bar for him instead. As Driver watches them, the boy\nturns around and notices him. Driver heads down another aisle\nbefore Irene sees him too, keeping to himself to himself.\n\n35 EXT. CAR PARK/ SUPERMARKET - DAY. 35\n\nDriver heads out of the supermarket with a small bag of\ngroceries when he spots Irene and Benicio again in the car park.\nIrene sits in a battered Oldsmobile, trying to start the engine.\nShe tries several times then gets out in frustration, opening\nthe hood and peering at the engine she has no idea how to fix.\nBenicio peers in too, trying to be helpful.\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n17\n9/24/10\n35 CONTINUED: 35\n\nDriver hesitates, all his instincts telling him to continue to\nhis car and drive away, but as he feels Irene's increasing\nfrustration he can't help himself, finally heading over to help.\n\nIrene looks over and sees him coming, surprised at first, then\nsmiling.

Irene\nwalks back into the room, smiling.\n\nIRENE\nYou just move to LA?\n\nDRIVER\nNo, I been here a while.\n\nIRENE\nAnd before that?\n\nDRIVER\nHere and there...\n\nIRENE\n(A gentle smile)\nToo many questions, huh?...\n\nDriver smiles back awkwardly, not sure how else to respond.\nIrene switches on the TV for Benicio, sitting him down on the\ncouch.\n\nDriver has a sip of water, glancing around the room. He notices\na few photographs on a side table. Most of them are of Benicio\nand Irene, but one of them shows the little boy standing next to\na strikingly handsome Latino man.\n\nIrene turns around and sees him looking at the picture.\n\nIRENE\nThat's Benicio's father.\n\nDriver takes in the significance of this, then looks back at\nher.\n\nDRIVER\nWhat's he do?\n\nIRENE\nHe's in jail.\n\nDRIVER\nI'm sorry.\n\nIRENE\n(Changing the subject)\nWhat do you do?\n\nDriver hesitates.\n\nDRIVER\nI drive.\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n19\n9/24/10\n37 CONTINUED: (2) 37\n\nIRENE\nLike a limo driver?\n\nDRIVER\nNo, for the movies...\n\nIRENE\n(INCREDULOUSLY)\nYou mean all those car chases and stuff?\n\nHe nods, a little embarrassed.\n\nIRENE\nIsn't that dangerous?\n\nHe seems thrown by her concern.\n\nDRIVER\nIt's just part-time. Most days I work in a\ngarage.\n\nIRENE\nWhere?\n\nDRIVER\nReseda Boulevard.\n\nIRENE\nYou should tell Benicio you're a stunt guy.\n\nDRIVER\nHe interested in that kind of stuff?\n\nIRENE\nAren't all little boys?\n\nShe smiles softly and he realizes she's teasing him.\n\nBENICIO O/S\nMama, I don't like this...\n\nIrene takes the remote and changes the channel for him. Driver\nwatches her quietly, then drains his glass of water.\n\nIRENE\nWould you like another glass?\n\nDRIVER\nI should get going...\n\nHe catches the disappointment in her eyes, but she covers it\nwith another good humored smile.\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n20\n9/24/10\n37 CONTINUED: (3) 37\n\nIRENE\nWell, thank you for your help.\n\nDRIVER\nThank you for the drink...\n\nShe takes his empty glass and walks him to the door.\n\n38 EXT/INT. STREET/ DRIVER'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 38\n\nPassing traffic roars by on the busy street. Irene and Benicio\nare walking home from the bus stop, chatting happily.

DRIVER'S CAR/ HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT. 39\n\nThe reflection of passing neon rolls down the Camaro's\nwindscreen.

The HOOKERS\nand HIPSTERS have taken over the streets while up above\nairbrushed movie stars stare down from their lofty billboards.\n\n40 EXT. PARKING LOT/ MINI MALL - MORNING. 40\n\nIt's early morning and Driver's been driving all night, unable\nto sleep. He heads across the parking lot towards a garishly lit\nmini-mall. Up ahead a small group of GANGBANGERS are hanging out\nwith intent. They see him coming and look over intimidatingly.\nDriver's only reaction is to bunch his car keys in his hand, the\nlongest key sliding between his second and third fingers like a\nweapon. The gangbangers don't see it but the unflinching look in\nhis eyes unnerves them and they look away, letting him pass.\n\n41 EXT/ INT. BUFFALO BAR AND GRILL/ LA - MORNING. 41\n\nJukebox music plays in the bar and grill. Driver sits on his\nown, working his way through a plate of bacon and eggs.\n\nBEARDED REDNECK OFFSCREEN\nMind if I cut in?...\n\nDriver looks up and sees a burly REDNECK with an unkempt beard\nand a wrestler's physique.

The\nRedneck's smile slowly fades.

FORECOURT/ SHANNON'S GARAGE - DAY. 42\n\nThe loud stutter of an unhealthy engine. Shannon sits in the\nsecond hand race car he bought in Montecito, revving the engine.\n\nSHANNON\nSounds like a goddamn M-16...\n\nDriver smiles, popping the hood. As Shannon limps out of the\nvehicle he sees a battered Oldsmobile drive into the forecourt.\nHe takes one look at the owner, then runs his hand through his\nwhite hair, breaking into a friendly smile.\n\nSHANNON\nGorgeous day just got even nicer. How can I\nhelp you, ma'am?\n\nWOMAN'S VOICE O/S\nI've got a problem with my car.\n\nSHANNON O/S\nI can imagine.

SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - DAY. 43\n\nThe Oldsmobile's engine looks like it hasn't been serviced in\nyears. Shannon is bent over the hood.\n\nSHANNON\n...Just my opinion, but I think you should\nconsider buying a new car...\n\nIRENE\n(With gentle irony)\nThat would be great...\n\nShe glances round and sees Benicio standing in the forecourt\nwith Driver, watching him work on his own car now.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n23\n9/24/10\n43 CONTINUED: 43\n\nDriver's so busy tuning the engine he hardly notices the boy.\nHis lack of interest finally gets a rise out of Benicio.\n\nBENICIO\nThat thing doesn't work.\n\nDRIVER\n(Without looking round)\nYou think?\n\nBenicio watches him sullenly, more intrigued than he lets on.\n\nBENICIO\nDrive it.\n\nDRIVER\nOkay.

LA RIVER - DAY. 47\n\nDriver's parked the car now in an area of the drainage canal\nwhich looks like an oasis. He leans against the vehicle, soft\nrock playing on his radio as he watches Benicio climb a tree.\n\n48 INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ SILVERLAKE - NIGHT. 48\n\nBenicio is asleep in the back of Driver's car now.

Driver\nfinally breaks the tension, making a tentative move towards the\ndoor. Irene opens it for him, looking up into his eyes.

SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - DAY. 53\n\nThe roar of machinery.

You watching?\n\nBenicio nods. Driver suddenly gives the TV set a hard smack and\nthe interference stops.\n\nDRIVER\nThink you can remember that?...\n\nBenicio grins. Driver smiles back then looks away as he hears\nthe phone ring. Irene walks out of her bedroom, dressed in her\nwaitress's uniform, and answers it.\n\nIRENE\nHello?...Yes?...Yes, this is she...\n\nDriver sees the look of surprise on Irene's face as she listens\nto the voice on the other end. The doorbell suddenly rings.\nIrene catches Driver's eye and asks him to open it. He heads\nover, checks the spy-hole, then opens the door. A YOUNG WOMAN\nwho's sitting for Benicio walks in, looking at Driver curiously.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN (IRENE'S FRIEND)\nHi...\n\nDRIVER\nHello...\n\nBENICIO\nHi Cindy...\n\nIrene's friend heads past Driver and scolds Benicio\naffectionately.\n\nIRENE'S FRIEND\nIt's 8:30. Teeth. Pyjamas. TV off.\n\nBENICIO\nIt's not the TV. It's a DVD...\n\nDriver looks back at Irene now. She puts down the phone, forcing\na smile but still looking distracted.\n\n55 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 55\n\nIrene sits next to Driver in the passenger seat, staring out of\nthe window at the glittering fountain in Echo Park.\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n28\n9/24/10\n55 CONTINUED: 55\n\nIRENE\nI've never come this way before...\n\nDRIVER\nIt's a short cut...\n\nIRENE\nThe park looks pretty at night...\n\nShe looks at Driver, watching him quietly, then looks away\nagain.\n\nDRIVER\nYou okay?...\n\nIrene takes a long time to answer, still staring out of the\nwindow.\n\nIRENE\nThat was my husband's lawyer on the phone.\nHe's getting an early release...\n\nShe tries to sound casual. Driver takes the news quietly, even\nthough it hits him like a sledgehammer.\n\nDRIVER\nThat's great...\n\nIRENE\nI'm happy for Benicio...\n\nDriver knows she's trying to explain herself but doesn't say\nanything, driving in silence.\n\nUp ahead the traffic lights turn red and the car slows to a\nstop.\n\nInside, the silence is unbearable. Irene pauses, then looks at\nDriver. He's even more handsome in the shadowy half-light,\nsomething achingly lonely and melancholy about his stillness.\n\nShe hesitates, then moves her hand towards his, brushing the\nback of his hand, then slipping her fingers between his.\n\nThe gesture is tiny but charged with emotion. They both stare\nout in silence, fingers clasped, then Irene gently withdraws her\nhand, as if nothing's happened.\n\nOutside the lights change to green.\n\n56 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - SUNSET. 56\n\nThe sound of laughter. A sign over the door says, Welcome home\nDad. Inside the apartment there's a small party going on.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n29\n9/24/10\n56 CONTINUED: 56\n\nIrene's husband, STANDARD, has been released from jail and his\nFRIENDS and FAMILY are here to celebrate. Holding Benicio in his\narms he makes a thank you speech to his guests.\n\nSTANDARD\n...I'm touched and grateful that you're all\nhere today -- even though I know it's\nprobably for the food not me...\n\nHis self-deprecating humor gets a chorus of laughter and\nagreement from the guests. Irene is standing next to her friend\nCindy, looking a little uncomfortable.\n\nSTANDARD\n...Anyhow, now that I've completed my MBA\nin catering from Chino Business School...\n(MORE LAUGHTER)\nIrene, Benicio and I are finally going to\nget our lives back together...\n\nHe raises his glass to her.\n\nSTANDARD\nI'd like to thank my wife for being the\nsmartest, most beautiful, most patient and\nloyal woman I know...\n\nMore applause. Irene stares back at Standard's handsome face,\nfeeling even more uncomfortable.\n\n57 INT. DRIVER'S BEDROOM/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - SUNSET. 57\n\nDriver lies on his bed, gazing up at the ceiling, listening to\nthe sound of the party echoing down the corridor.\n\n58 INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 58\n\nIt's nighttime and the party's getting louder. Standard's on the\nphone to someone, trying to hear them over the music.\n\nSTANDARD\nI'm sorry, I can't hear you...\n\nHe heads into the bedroom to take the call. The voice on the\nother end is accented and unfriendly.\n\nMAN'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\nCan you hear me now, you cunt?\n\nStandard pauses, looking concerned.\n\nSTANDARD\nSure.\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n30\n9/24/10\n58 CONTINUED: 58\n\nMAN'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\nYou're gonna come see me tomorrow, you\nunderstand?...\n\nAcross the crowded room, Irene is looking for Standard. She sees\nhim in the bedroom, switching off his phone, and heads over.\n\nIRENE\nBenicio wants you to put him to bed.\n\nSTANDARD\nOkay.\n\nHe gives her a warm smile.\n\nIRENE\nWho was that on the phone?\n\nSTANDARD\nMy parole officer. He thinks he may have\nfound me a job.\n\n59 INT. DRIVER'S BEDROOM/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 59\n\nThe noise of the party is finally too much for Driver. He gets\noff the bed and slips on his jacket.\n\n60 INT. APARTMENT/ CORRIDOR/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 60\n\nIrene is finding the party overwhelming too. She heads out into\nthe corridor to have a cigarette when she sees Driver across the\nhallway, locking the door to his own apartment. She hesitates,\nthen calls out.\n\nIRENE\nHey...\n\nHe turns around and sees her standing there with a smile.\n\nIRENE\nI'm sorry about the noise. I was going to\nleave a note under your door warning you we\nwere having a party.\n\nDRIVER\nDon't worry. I won't complain.\n\nIRENE\nI wish you would. Maybe the cops'd show up\nand send everybody home.\n\nTheir eyes stay on each other, the music pounding in the\nbackground.\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n31\n9/24/10\n60 CONTINUED: 60\n\nIRENE\nThe car works great by the way. Hasn't\nstalled once.\n\nDRIVER\nI'm glad.\n\nAnother awkward silence, so much she wants to say but can't.\n\nIRENE\nListen, if you're hungry we got plenty of\nFOOD -\n\nSuddenly she turns around as she hears her apartment door open.\nStandard stands there with Benicio, holding a bag of trash. He\npauses, then smiles.\n\nSTANDARD\nI thought if we emptied the trash everyone\nwould get the message and go home...\n\nHe grins at his wife, then looks over at Driver, his smile\nhiding whatever he feels inside.\n\nSTANDARD\nYou're the new neighbor, right? Benicio's\ntold me all about you...\n\nDriver seems unsure how to respond.\n\nDRIVER\nHe's a great kid.\n\nSTANDARD\nI can't take any of the credit. He's got a\ngreat mother.\n\nStandard rests his hand gently on Benicio's head, still staring\nat Driver.\n\nSTANDARD\nHe tells me you drive for the movies?\n\nDRIVER\nYeah.\n\nSTANDARD\nMust be pretty good?\n\nDRIVER\nI get by.\n\nSTANDARD\nNot like a nine to five gig, huh?...\n\n(CONTINUED)\n32\n9/24/10\n60 CONTINUED: (2) 60\n\nHe's still smiling but there's a slight edge to his voice. Irene\nlooks uncomfortable.\n\nIRENE\nYou want me to take that?\n\nSTANDARD\nNo, we got it.\n\nHis eyes are still fixed on Driver.\n\nSTANDARD\nYou want to come in, join us for a drink?\n\nDRIVER\nI've got some things to do.\n\nSTANDARD\nAt this hour of night?\n\nIRENE\nStandard, he's busy...\n\nStandard doesn't respond, still holding Driver's gaze.\n\nSTANDARD\nWell, if we're still going by the time\nyou're back you know where we are. It's\ngood to meet you...\n\nHe slips his arm around his son now and continues down the\ncorridor, brushing past Driver on his way to empty the trash.\nDriver looks at Irene, then heads off in the same direction as\nStandard and Benicio to take the elevator. The two men stand\nthere in charged silence, one emptying the trash, the other\nwaiting for the elevator, only Benicio oblivious to the tension.\n\n61 EXT/ INT. DRIVER'S CAR/ LA - NIGHT. 61\n\nBrooding movie stars look down from the billboards. Driver is in\nhis car now, soft rock playing on the radio.\n\n62 INT.

CHUCK E. CHEESE RESTAURANT/ LA - NIGHT. 64\n\nStandard, Irene and Benicio are having dinner at a Chuck E.\nCheese restaurant. We still sense the distance between Standard\nand Irene, but Benicio seems completely unaware of it, talking\nexcitedly as he eats his pizza. Standard reaches out and takes\nIrene's hand gently as he listens to his son.\n\n65 OMITTED 65\n\n66 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVER LAKE BOULEVARD - DAY. 66\n\nA noise of hammering and drills. The corporate signage has been\nscraped off the race car and the seats ripped out. Bernie Rose\nhas bought his partner Nino to the garage to take a look at his\ninvestment.\n\nNINO\n...We paid three hundred fucking grand for\nthis?\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nI paid for it. Out of my own pocket.\nAnyway, that's just the shell. You start\nwith the shell, then you build the frame,\nthen the motor.\n(Pointing to an engine nearby)\nI paid three hundred for that. The money\ngoes on the inside not the outside.\n\nNINO\nFuck that. If I'm gonna blow three hundred\nI wanna make sure everyone can see it. Go\nwaste your money on something else...\n\nShannon smiles nervously, worried Nino's going to sabotage his\ndeal with Bernie.\n\nNINO\n(Pointing to a Thunderbird)\n...How about that fucking pussy mobile over\nthere.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYou buy it. Shannon sell him the car...\n\nAt the far end of the garage Driver hears them laughing, too\nbusy working on his car to pay any attention. Shannon opens the\ndoor of the Thunderbird and invites Nino to take a seat.\n\nSHANNON\nTry her out. She's more comfortable than a\nwater bed.\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n34\n9/24/10\n66 CONTINUED: 66\n\nNINO\nI already got a fucking water bed.\n\nHe sits heavily in the car and starts prodding and pressing all\nthe control buttons as if he wants to break them.\n\nNINO\nWhat does this fucking thing do?\n\nSHANNON\nWindshield wipers.\n\nNINO\nHow about this little clit? I don't know\nwhether to fuck it or drive it. Fuck it,\nI'll drive it...\n\nBernie Rose shakes his head at his partner's foul language then\nlooks away, observing Driver quietly.\n\nDriver applies a blow torch to his car, so absorbed in his work\nhe doesn't hear Bernie Rose approach.\n\nBERNIE ROSE O/S\nHow you doing?...\n\nDriver hears him and turns off the blow torch, standing up\nrespectfully. Bernie Rose gives him a friendly smile.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nSo, when's our first race?\n\nDRIVER\nSoon.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYou gonna be ready?\n\nThere's something gently challenging in his gaze.\n\nDRIVER\nI hope so...\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nCautious man. Like myself. Don't wanna make\npromises you can't keep...\n\nDriver smiles but doesn't respond. Bernie Rose finds him as hard\nto talk to as everyone else. Across the garage, Nino sits in the\nT-Bird with Shannon, still fucking with him. Bernie watches\nthem.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nHe ever tell you how we met?\n\n(CONTINUED)\n35\n9/24/10\n66 CONTINUED: (2) 66\n\nDriver shakes his head.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nI did some producing back in the 80's.\nInteresting pictures. Kind of European.\nShannon arranged the cars for us and did\nall the stunts. I knew he was overcharging\nme but I loved having him around. His next\nbusiness venture he tried the same thing\nwith some of Nino's friends they broke his\nspine. He never had much luck...\n\nHe's about to continue when they're interrupted by a familiar\nvoice.\n\nSTANDARD O/S\nHey!...\n\nDriver turns around and sees Irene's husband, Standard, heading\ntowards him with a confident smile.\n\nSTANDARD\nYou got a minute? I want to -\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nWe're talking...\n\nBernie Rose barely raises his voice but it's full of quiet\nmenace and authority. Standard pauses, stung, but instinctively\nsenses this is someone you don't mess with.\n\nSTANDARD\nI'll wait outside...\n\nBernie Rose watches him leave with a look of contempt, then\nturns back to Driver with a smile, resuming their conversation.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nThe reason I'm telling you this is because\nhe's got a lot invested in you. So do I...\n\nTheir eyes stay on each other with just a hint of tension.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nAnything you need just let me know...\n\nDriver nods. Bernie Rose studies him a moment, then finally\nwalks away.\n\n67 EXT.

How much\ndo I owe you?\n\nDRIVER\nDon't worry about it.\n\nSTANDARD\nI do worry. I like to pay my debts.\n\nDriver senses the quiet pride in his voice, and lets it go.\n\nDRIVER\nCall it fifty.\n\nStandard counts out some bills from his tattered wallet, his\neyes lowered.\n\nSTANDARD\nI was thinking of trading her in for a new\ncar. Something fast and cheap.\n\nDRIVER\nYou can't have both.\n\nSTANDARD\nAlright then, fast.\n\nEven though he smiles Driver senses just a hint of tension on\nhis handsome face.\n\nDRIVER\n(Pointing to a car)\nSomething like that Buick over there'll\ncost you nine grand but there isn't much\npoint in a city where you can't drive\nfaster than sixty five.\n\nStandard considers the car a moment, something clearly bothering\nhim, then looks back at Driver.\n\nSTANDARD\nYou must think I'm an asshole?\n\nDriver isn't sure what he's getting at.\n\nDRIVER\nI wouldn't know.\n\nSTANDARD\nWell, I am. Six months inside for holding\nsomebody else's stolen shit...\n\nHe smiles ironically, his gaze still fixed on Driver.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n37\n9/24/10\n67 CONTINUED: (2) 67\n\nSTANDARD\nI appreciate what you did for my family\nwhen I was away but I don't plan to fuck up\na second time...\n\nIt's a thinly veiled message that he's back and here to stay.\nDriver stares back at him when Shannon emerges from the garage\nwith Bernie Rose and Nino, calling out.\n\nSHANNON\nHey, kid! Come say goodbye, the money\npeople are leaving!...\n\nDriver and Standard stare at each other a moment longer then\nDriver breaks off.\n\nDRIVER\nExcuse me.\n\nSTANDARD\nSee you around...\n\nDriver walks off, leaving Standard alone with his thoughts.\nShannon watches Standard curiously as Driver approaches.\n\nSHANNON\nWho was that?\n\nDRIVER\nIrene's husband.\n\nSHANNON\n(GRINNING)\nWhat did I tell you about married women?\n\nNino can't resist another dig at Shannon.\n\nNINO\nWhat the fuck do you know about married\nwomen?\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nCan you for once say something without the\nword fuck in it?\n\nAs they continue their banter, Driver glances at Standard.

He\nhesitates, conflicted, then finally gets out of the car.\n\n69 INT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT/ BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 69\n\nIrene walks out of the kitchen with a tray of food, then stops\nas she sees Driver sitting at a booth. She looks surprised to\nsee him, but pleased, serving her table first then heading over.\n\nIRENE\nHi...\n\nDRIVER\nHi...\n\nTheir eyes stay on each other, oblivious to the noise.\n\nIRENE\nWe haven't seen you around in a while. You\nmust have been pretty busy?...\n\nDRIVER\nYou look pretty busy yourself...\n\nShe smiles, glancing at the tables she's supposed to serve.\n\nIRENE\nWhat can I get you?\n\nDRIVER\nI already ate. I just wanted to see how you\nwere?\n\nHis concern touches her and makes her uncomfortable at the same\ntime.\n\nIRENE\nWe're okay. Standard thinks he may have\nfound a job so I can give up my night\nshift...\n\nDriver stares back at her with his intense gaze.\n\nIRENE\nBenicio misses you...\n\nFrom the way she says it she could almost be talking about\nherself.\n\nIRENE\nHe keeps asking me to invite you for\ndinner...\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n39\n9/24/10\n69 CONTINUED: 69\n\nDRIVER\nI'd like that...\n\nHis gentle gaze is finally too much for her. She grins, excusing\nherself.\n\nIRENE\nI better serve some food...\n\nIt's only when she has her back turned that we see how hard this\nis for her. Driver watches her walk away, lost in thought.\n\n70 INT.

Suddenly he notices something else in\nthe shadows. A figure lies sprawled against one of the pillars.\nA smaller figure kneels a few feet away. Driver stops his car\nnow, climbing out to see what's happened.\n\nThe prone figure groans in pain. As Driver approaches he\nrealizes it's Standard. His face is covered in blood and he\nclutches his ribs. The smaller figure is Benicio. He stares at\nhis father helplessly, then looks up at Driver in tears. Driver\nkneels beside Standard, checking nothing's broken.\n\nDRIVER\nCan you move?\n\nSTANDARD\nWhere's Benicio?\n\nDRIVER\nHe's right here...\n\nDriver glances at Benicio. He looks terrified.

Sorry about getting all this blood\neverywhere...\n\nHe's still shaken but tries to pass it off with a smile.\n\nSTANDARD\nFucking punks took me by surprise...\n\nDriver watches him, unconvinced.\n\nDRIVER\nFucking punks didn't look like they needed\nto...\n\nStandard looks at him in surprise now.\n\nSTANDARD\nYou saw them, huh?...\n\nDriver doesn't answer, waiting for him to continue.

Driver heads\nover, then stops as he notices something in Benicio's hand. The\nlittle boy is clutching it as if he's afraid to let go.\n\nDRIVER\nWhat have you got there?...\n\nBenicio holds out his hand to reveal a small bullet.

It's my score. Either\nyou sign on or you don't.\n\nDriver stares at him quietly, finding it hard to conceal his\ncontempt.\n\nDRIVER\nI drive.

Irene notices he's drinking, turning to Driver.\n\nIRENE\nWould you like some more chicken?\n\nDRIVER\nThanks...\n\nTheir eyes stay on each as she serves him.

This time next week I'm\ngonna take you and Benicio away with me...\n\nIrene stops and looks at him in surprise.\n\nSTANDARD\nWhere you wanna go, Benicio?...\n\nHis quiet confidence concerns her even more.\n\nBENICIO\nDisneyland.\n\nSTANDARD\nForget Disneyland. I'm gonna take you and\nyour mother away from this bullshit city -\n\nIRENE\nBenicio, it's time for bed -\n\nSTANDARD\nYour papa's got it all figured out -\n\nIRENE\nBenicio, you heard me -\n\nSTANDARD\nIt's okay. I'll take him...\n\nStandard gets up from the table, lifting Benicio up in his arms\nand carrying him back to his bedroom. Driver watches them. Even\nin this kind of mood Standard's clearly devoted to his son.\nIrene waits until they're gone, then turns back to Driver.\n\nIRENE\nI'm sorry.\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n47\n9/24/10\n78 CONTINUED: (3) 78\n\nDRIVER\nDon't worry...\n\nShe hesitates, torn, then looks up at him again, needing to\nconfide in someone.\n\nIRENE\nEvery time he makes that speech about\ntaking me and Benicio away from here he's\nin some kind of trouble...\n\nDriver sees the deep concern in her eyes and feels even more\ntorn. Irene gets up, clearing away some plates.\n\n79 INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 79\n\nDriver strides through the parking lot and climbs in his car.\n\n80 INT. CAR/ UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 80\n\nDriver sits in the car as if it's his retreat from the world. He\nstares out, then turns on a stop watch, listening to it tick,\nfinding his balance again in the familiarity of the ritual.\n\n81 EXT. PAWN SHOP/ TARAZANA/ LA - DAY. 81\n\nThe pawn shop is nothing much to look at from the outside,\nanother anonymous LA store front. Driver's parked the car a\nhundred yards from the entrance, his police scanner crackling.\nStandard sits beside him in the passenger seat, looking tense.\n\nDRIVER\nYou don't have to do this.\n\nSTANDARD\n(Forcing a smile)\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nHe tries to make light of it but doesn't sound convincing. Out\nof his window he sees Blanche cross the street and enter the\npawn shop and looks even more nervous now.\n\nSTANDARD\nIrene and Benicio think the world of you,\nyou know that, right?...\n\nDriver glances at him, sensing his anxiety.\n\nSTANDARD\nSay something happens to me, you think you\ncould find a way to take care of them?...\n\nStandard's still staring ahead, but Driver can sense his fear.\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n48\n9/24/10\n81 CONTINUED: 81\n\nDRIVER\nIt's not too late...\n\nStandard considers a moment, then shakes his head.\n\nSTANDARD\nI gotta do this for them...\n\nHe forces a smile, slips on his sunglasses, then finally opens\nthe door.\n\nDRIVER\nYou got five minutes...\n\nSTANDARD\n(GRINNING)\nI'll see you in four...\n\nDriver watches him cross the street with a strong sense of\nforeboding. Standard enters the pawn shop. Driver starts his\nstopwatch now, listening to the seconds tick away.\n\nHe casts his eyes around the street, observing the smallest\ndetails -- the number plates of other vehicles; the windows of\noverlooking buildings.\n\nThe white hot sun blazes down, reflecting on the pawn shop\nwindows, hiding everything inside.\n\nThe police scanner crackles but picks up no activity. Driver\nlistens to his stop watch, in his own world. He starts the\nengine and sets off, cruising slowly past the pawn shop, heading\nfor the corner where he told Standard he'd be waiting.\n\nHe pulls over by the curb when suddenly he notices something.\nParked a hundred yards down the road he sees another vehicle\nglinting in the sunlight. To the ordinary eye it's no different\nfrom the other cars parked nearby, but to Driver it stands out.\nFor one, it's a Chrysler. Secondly, it has reinforced bumpers\nand racing tires.\n\nDriver's stopwatch shows four minutes now. He looks away from\nthe Chrysler, gazing at the doors of the pawn shop, expecting\nStandard and Blanche to burst out at any moment.\n\nBut there's no sign of them.\n\nThe seconds tick away. Five minutes. Driver hesitates, all his\ninstincts telling him to drive off, but he stays where he is,\nthinking of Irene.\n\nSuddenly he sees Standard and Blanche emerge from the pawn shop,\nStandard clutching a big black gym bag in his hand.\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n49\n9/24/10\n81 CONTINUED: (2) 81\n\nHe smiles at Driver as he approaches when suddenly he hears the\ncrack of gunshots behind him. Driver sees the look of panic on\nhis face as he spins around.\n\nA GUY IN A SUIT strides out of the pawn shop. Crouching low in\nan expert firing position he squeezes off several shots. The\nforce of the bullets sends Standard flying.\n\nDriver sees him hit the sidewalk, arterial blood pumping from\nhis neck. Blanche screams, grabbing the gym bag and leaping into\nthe back seat of the car. Driver hesitates, takes one last look\nat Standard's lifeless body, then hits the gas as more gunshots\ncrack behind him.\n\nAs Driver's car roars down the street, the Chrysler suddenly\ncomes to life, pulling out of its parking place.\n\n82 INT/ EXT. CAR/ STREET/ TARZANA/ LA - DAY. 82\n\nDriver glances in his rear-view mirror and sees the Chrysler on\nhis tail. It doesn't seem to be trying to close the gap, just\nfollowing at a discreet distance. In the back seat, Blanche zips\nopen the gym bag, then stares in shock.\n\nBLANCHE\n...Christ, there wasn't supposed to be this\nmuch money!...\n\nThere are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed\ninside the gym bag. Driver catches her reaction in the mirror,\nbut his attention is focussed on the Chrysler. Up ahead, at an\nintersection, the lights turn red. Driver thinks about running\nthem, but decides against it, braking sharply. The Chrysler\ndraws up beside him, its windows glinting in the sunlight.\n\nBLANCHE\nMove for Chrissakes!...\n\nDriver ignores her, still watching the Chrysler out of the\ncorner of his eye. The lights change to green but Driver doesn't\nmove. Nor does the Chrysler. Behind them, other cars start\nhonking their horns. Suddenly Driver roars off, swerving left at\nspeed.\n\nThe Chrysler reacts, screeching off in pursuit.\n\nDriver floors the gas. On speed and power his vehicle may be no\nmatch for the Chrysler, but in traffic the odds are even. He\nweaves his way past the slower cars, putting obstacles between\nhimself and the Chrysler. The pursuing car matches him move for\nmove, staying on his tail.\n\nIn the back seat, Blanche looks terrified, buckling herself in.\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n49A\n9/24/10\n82 CONTINUED: 82\n\nDriver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a\ndeserted canyon road. The mustang somehow manages to make\nthe same turn. It gets close enough to \"pit\" Driver, its nose\npressing against the rear corner of Driver's vehicle.\n\nDriver's almost run off the road, but manages to save it and\nregains control of his car.\n\nThe Mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into\nhim. As it moves in to deliver the knockout blow, Driver\npulls the Emergency Brake and spins 180 degrees, causing the\nMustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment.\n\nNow the two cars are nose to nose, barrelling down the road,\nDriver heading in reverse as fast as he can, the Mustang\nclosing fast.\n\nIt rams Driver's front bumper. BAM! The two cars separated\nfor an instant.\n\nThe Mustang guns it, ready to smash into Driver again...\n\nDriver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with\nconstruction equipment. In a last ditch attempt to evade his\npursuer he throws a reverse 180, then incredibly keeps going,\nspinning 270 degrees.\n\nThe Mustang tries to make the same turn, but this time the\nmaneuver is beyond his ability. Driver's suckered him into a\ncorner he can't control.\n\nThe Mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a\nsickening crunch of metal on metal.\n\nDriver guns the motor and speeds away.\n50\n9/24/10\n\n\n\n\n83 EXT. MOTEL/ LA - DAY. 83\n\nPurple neon spills onto the forecourt of a seedy motel.\n\n84 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 84\n\nThe black gym bag lies open on a double bed, full to the brim\nwith stacks of cash. Blanche sits on the bed, looking pale.\n\nDRIVER\nHow much did Cook tell you you could expect\nto net?\n\nBLANCHE\nForty Grand...\n\nShe glances at the bag, staring at how much more money there is.\nDriver switches on the cheap TV set with the remote, flicking\nthrough the news channels. There's no mention of the robbery\nyet. He zips up the bag and heads out.\n\nDRIVER\nStay here. Don't answer the door...\n\nBlanche nods, too shaken to protest.\n\n85 EXT. MOTEL/ LA - DAY. 85\n\nDriver hesitates, then dials a number on his cell-phone. Benicio\nanswers.\n\nBENICIO'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\nHello?...\n\nDriver hears the tremor in his voice.\n\nDRIVER\nBenicio?...\n\nBENICIO'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\nYeah?...\n\nDRIVER\nIs your mom there?...\n\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n51\n9/24/10\n85 CONTINUED: 85\n\nThere's an uncomfortable silence. Driver can feel the little boy\ntrying to hold it together.\n\nBENICIO'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\nShe's talking to the police...\n\n85a INT. IRENE'S APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - DAY. 85a\n\nIn the living room we can see Irene sitting on the couch with a\nmale and female POLICE OFFICER, looking dazed, taking in the\nnews of Standard's death.\n\nINTERCUT\n\nDriver pauses, still on the phone to Benicio.\n\nDRIVER\nTell her I'll call later...\n\n86 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 86\n\nA soap opera plays on the TV. Driver walks back into the motel\nroom. Blanche lies on the bed, looking more relaxed. Driver\npicks up the remote and flicks through the channels until he\nfinally finds a breaking news story on the robbery. There is a\npolice mug-shot of Standard on screen.\n\nTV REPORT\n...The armed robber was pronounced dead at\nthe scene. He was identified as Standard\nGuzman of Echo Park, Los Angeles...\n\nDriver listens to the report in silence. Blanche seems upset\nagain, confronted with the reality of what's happened.\n\nTV REPORT\n...Other details are unclear but the owner\nof the pawn shop told reporters that the\nrobber had no accomplices and that the\nitems he'd taken had been recovered. In\nother news...\n\nDriver switches off the TV, staring at the blank screen in\nsurprise. He turns to Blanche.\n\nDRIVER\nThe guy saw you grab the money and jump in\nthe car -- why didn't he say anything?\n\nBLANCHE\nI've no idea.\n\nDRIVER\nAny idea there'd be another car waiting?\n\n(CONTINUED)\n52\n9/24/10\n86 CONTINUED: 86\n\nThis time she takes a fraction too long to answer.\n\nBLANCHE\nI already told you everything -\n\nDriver suddenly slaps her -- hard.\n\nDRIVER\nYou just got a little kid's father killed.\nYou think I won't hurt you?\n\nHe raises his hand to slap her again and this time she talks,\ntears welling in her eyes.\n\nBLANCHE\n...Cook told me another car would hold us\nup...but he never said anything about this\nmuch money or anyone getting killed...\n\nDriver stares at her quietly, beginning to put the pieces\ntogether in his head.\n\nDRIVER\nYou were gonna rip us off and split the\ntake?\n\nShe nods guiltily.\n\nDRIVER\nHow long have you known him?\n\nBLANCHE\nJust a couple months. We were fooling\naround. I've never been mixed up in\nanything like this -\n\nDRIVER\nYou know his real name?\n\nBLANCHE\nHe told me it was Chris, but I just called\nhim Cook.\n\nDRIVER\nYou're going to take me to him right now,\nyou understand?\n\nShe nods, terrified, tears running down her face.\n\nBLANCHE\n....Can I go wash up?...\n\nDriver nods distractedly, his mind racing. Blanche heads over to\nthe bathroom.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n53\n9/24/10\n86 CONTINUED: (2) 86\n\nAs she disappears inside Driver notices something on the bed\nwhere she's just been lying. It's her cell phone. Still flipped\nopen as if she's called someone recently.\n\nDriver reaches for the cell phone when he notices the silhouette\nof a MAN crossing the curtains. Someone's outside. The door\nhandle of the motel room starts to turn, slowly -- then suddenly\nthere's the roar of a shotgun from the bathroom.\n\nDriver reacts in an instant, rushing towards the bathroom door.\nHe has to barge it open, something obstructing his way.\n\n87 INT. BATHROOM/ MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 87\n\nDriver almost trips over Blanche's sprawled body as he bursts\nthrough. One quick glance and he knows she's dead - half her\nhead blown off. Another quick glance and he sees her killer, a\nbig burly HITMAN, trying to climb through the same bathroom\nwindow where he just shot her.\n\nDriver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he\ncan get off another shot and pulling him through the window. The\nhitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his\nforehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes.\n\nDriver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into\nthe glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as\nthey struggle. Crawling away, he grabs the towel rack and pulls\nthe metal bar off the wall. Using it as a spear he impales the\nhitman and grabs his shotgun.\n\n88 INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY. 88\n\nIn the bedroom, the 2nd HITMAN finally kicks the door open.\nDriver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time --\nfiring the 1st shooter's shotgun. The force of the blast picks\nup the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag\ndoll.\n\nThe startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as\nit began. Driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion, his hand and\nhis arm ripped open by the broken glass. There's blood splatter\nall over the wall. Neon lights from outside flashing on the dead\nman's face. But no panicked footsteps or sirens yet.\n\nDriver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his\npockets. All he finds are a set of car keys.\n\n89 INT. OFFICE/ SHANNON'S GARAGE - DAY. 89\n\nShannon stands in his office, listening silently on the phone,\nlooking like he's been punched in the gut.\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n54\n9/24/10\n89 CONTINUED: 89\n\nSHANNON\nWhy didn't you tell me?...\n\nAll he hears is silence on the other end.\n\nSHANNON\nWell, I guess it's done now...\n\nHe leans back against a car.\n\nSHANNON\nHow big's the take?...\n\nDRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\nOne million I guess...\n\nSHANNON\nJesus...\n\nHe looks dazed by the thought of so much money.\n\nSHANNON\nYou better bring it over.\n\nDRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\nI'm hurt. I need a doctor to patch me up...\n\nSHANNON\nI'll take care of it...\n\n90 OMITTED 90\n\n91 INT. OFFICE/ SHANNON'S GARAGE - NIGHT. 91\n\nAn underworld doctor, \"DOC\", a shabbily dressed old man who\nlooks well past his prime takes out a small bottle of scotch\nalong with his surgical tools, preparing for Driver's arrival.\nShannon watches him uncertainly then heads downstairs as he\nhears a noise in the garage.\n\n92 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE - NIGHT. 92\n\nShannon arrives downstairs to see Driver walking unsteadily\ntowards him in the gloom. Shannon can't help glancing at his\nhands, expecting him to be carrying the bag with the money, but\nthere's no sign of it.\n\n93 INT. OFFICE/ SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVER LAKE BOULEVARD - NIGHT.93\n\nScissoring Driver's blood soaked shirt away Doc examines the\nshards of glass embedded in his arm, then notices the deep scars\nrunning down his back.\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n55\n9/24/10\n93 CONTINUED: 93\n\nDOC\n...Looks like you got more metal inside you\nthan a ten ton truck...\n(His hand shakes)\nYou'd be better off with a mechanic not a\nmedic...\n\nDriver looks up at him warily from Shannon's pull out bed.\n\nDOC\nRelax. Just having my fun with you...\n\nDoc picks up his bottle of scotch from among his bowls of\nPeroxide and Betadine, takes a drink, then offers it to Driver.\n\nDOC\nTake a hit off that. Chances are you'll\nneed it...\n\nDriver shakes his head, closing his eyes. Shannon watches him\nquietly, concerned for him but also curious about the money.\n\nSHANNON\nWhat did you do with the cash?\n\nDRIVER\nIt's safe.\n\nShannon hesitates, but can't help himself.\n\nSHANNON\nYou want me to look after it for you?\n\nDriver doesn't answer, gritting his teeth as Doc pulls out the\nlargest shard of glass.\n\nSHANNON\nJust think what we could do with all that\nDOUGH -\n\nDRIVER\nTwo guys just tried to kill me for it. I\nwant to find out who it belongs to first...\n\nShannon nods, coming back down to earth.\n\nSHANNON\nThis guy Cook got a real name?...\n\nDRIVER\nMaybe Chris. Probably not...\n\nSHANNON\nI'll ask Bernie if he's heard of him...\n\n(CONTINUED)\n56\n9/24/10\n93 CONTINUED: (2) 93\n\nDriver grimaces again as Doc pulls out another shard of glass.\n\nSHANNON\nI wish you'd talked to me first...\n\nDriver doesn't reply, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.\n\nSHANNON\nLotta guys fall for other mens' wives, but\nyou're the only one I know robs a joint to\nmake it up to the husband...\n\n94 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - DAY. 94\n\nAn elegant apartment full of framed photographs of beautiful\ngrandchildren and movie posters from Hollywood's golden age.\nBernie is in his silk pyjamas, looking like he's just woken up.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYou want some coffee?\n\nSHANNON\nNo, thanks...\n\nShannon looks tense but tries to hide it. From next door they\ncan hear the sound of raised voices. Bernie Rose grabs the TV\nremote and turns up the volume to drown out his neighbors.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nThey've been going at it ever since they\nmoved in. She's such a nice lady but it's a\nlousy Shidach. It's a wonder they haven't\nkilled each other...\n(A BEAT)\nSo, what's your interest in the Seventh\nHeaven?\n\nShannon doesn't understand, looking confused.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nIt's a strip joint on La Cienega. Your\nfriend Cook runs it. Why're you curious\nabout him all of a sudden?\n\nEven though they're close, Shannon's wary of giving away too\nmuch information.\n\nSHANNON\nA friend of mine owes him some money. I was\nwondering if you knew him?\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYeah, I know him. He's a crazy Albanian. If\nI were your friend I'd pay up.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n57\n9/24/10\n94 CONTINUED: 94\n\nBernie Rose pours himself a cup of coffee in the kitchenette.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYou wake me up this early this friend must\nbe a close friend?\n\nSHANNON\n(HESITATING)\nYeah...\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nHow's our car by the way?\n\nSHANNON\nWe're all set for next month.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nAnd our driver?\n\nSHANNON\nHe's doing great.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nThat's what you should worry about...\n\nShannon smiles back but Bernie senses how distracted he is.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYou want my advice? Let your friend work it\nout for himself. Don't take pills for other\npeople's headaches...\n(HE GRINS)\nYou got twenty minutes? I need you to run\ndown to the market and get me some milk...\n\n95 OMITTED 95\n\n96 INT. HALL/ STAIRS/ STRIP JOINT - DAY. 96\n\nSunlight pours through a doorway. Driver heads down some stairs,\npassing some half naked STRIPPERS at the bar. There's a handful\nof CLIENTS watching a pole dance, but otherwise the place is\nempty. Driver turns down a long corridor. A couple of STRIPPERS\nemerge from their changing room, surprised to see him, but he\nputs them at ease with a friendly smile.\n\nDRIVER\nCook moved office again?\n\nSTRIPPER\nThat one over there...\n\nDriver smiles gratefully, then heads towards an office at the\nend of the corridor. He knocks on the door. A voice calls back.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n58\n9/24/10\n96 CONTINUED: 96\n\nCOOK O/S\nIt's open...\n\nDriver takes a hammer out of his jacket, then starts turning the\ndoor handle as if he can't get in.\n\nCOOK O/S\nIt's open, goddamit!...\n\nHe hears Cook striding impatiently towards the door now. He\nwaits, then suddenly kicks the door open, right in Cook's face.\n\nBefore Cook can recover, Driver storms into the office, smashing\nhim across the shoulder with the hammer. Cook collapses in a\nheap. Driver's about to hit him again, when he sees that Cook's\nleft hand is broken and there are cuts and bruises on his face.\nSomeone's clearly given him a beating since the robbery.\n\nDRIVER\nShould've figured you for a shill. Who were\nyou fronting for?\n\nCOOK\nFuck you -\n\nDriver smashes the hammer into Cook's right hand now, breaking\nit too. Cook screams. Some of the strippers have gathered at the\ndoor but Driver couldn't care less.\n\nDRIVER\nWhose money am I holding?\n\nCOOK\nDon't worry. They'll come get it. You don't\nknow who you're fucking with -\n\nDriver smashes the hammer into the metal plates supporting\nCook's left hand. He screams like a stuck pig.\n\nDRIVER\nWho's money am I holding?\n\nCOOK\n(Barely able to get the words out)\nFuck you...\n\nThe strippers look stunned and riveted at the same time. Driver\nbends over Cook and rifles through his pockets. Finally he finds\nwhat he's looking for. Cook's cell phone. He scrolls down the\ncall log and finds the same number appearing again and again.\n\n97 OMITTED 97\n59\n9/24/10\n\n\n\n\n98 INT.

NINO'S PIZZERIA - DAY. 101\n\nTan Suit walks into the dining area. A large bull of a man sits\non his own in the empty restaurant with his back to us.

Irene watches him, still stunned. He\nlooks back at her.\n\nIRENE\nI can't talk now.

It's what I do...\n\nShe stares at him in deep disappointment.\n\nIRENE\nStupid me...\n\nShe turns away when the elevator bell rings. The doors open,\nrevealing TAN SUIT. Neither Driver or Irene recognizes him but\nwe do. He smiles, pretending to look confused.\n\nTAN SUIT\nSorry, I'm supposed to be going down...\n\nIRENE\nSo are we...\n\nShe steps into the elevator. Driver follows her in.\n\nTAN SUIT\nWhich floor?\n\nDRIVER\nParking lot, please...\n\nTan Suit presses the button and the doors slide shut.\n\n106 INT. ELEVATOR/ APARTMENT BLOCK/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 106\n\nDriver and Irene ride down in silence, their eyes fixed on each\nother. Tan Suit watches them quietly, considering a move, but\nDriver glances at him and he smiles, biding his time. The lights\non the panel descend. The elevator bell finally rings as they\nreach the lower level. Tan Suit hesitates, but Driver waits for\nhim to go out first. He nods goodnight and heads off into the\ndarkness of the parking lot. Driver follows Irene, the two of\nthem heading in the opposite direction.\n\n107 INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE/ APARTMENT/ ECHO PARK - NIGHT. 107\n\nThe overhead lights flicker, the huge underground car park\nhidden in shadow. Driver walks alongside Irene in silence. In\nthe distance Tan Suit's footsteps slowly fade.\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n64\n9/24/10\n107 CONTINUED: 107\n\nDRIVER\nI'm leaving. I want you to come with me...\n\nIrene can't believe what she's hearing.\n\nIRENE\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nDRIVER\nYou and Benicio...\n\nShe's almost too stunned to speak, walking even faster now.\n\nIRENE\nYou're crazy. I don't even know you -\n\nDRIVER\nYou will. Once I straighten out this thing\nI'm getting out for good. We'll go some\nplace. Anywhere you want.\n\nShe shakes her head, fighting her feelings for him.\n\nIRENE\nIt doesn't work like that.\n\nDRIVER\nWhy not?...\n\nShe stops and looks at him.\n\nIRENE\nBecause people like you never get out. And\nI don't want my son to grow up like that...\n\nShe holds his gaze with regret. Driver's about to respond when\nsuddenly he catches a fleeting movement out of the corner of his\neye.\n\nA beat -- then he suddenly lunges -- grabbing Irene and pulling\nher to the ground. In the same instant Tan Suit appears out of\nthe darkness, opening fire with his automatic.\n\nBullets spark as they hit the concrete floor and the other\nparked vehicles. Driver drags Irene behind a car now, covering\nher with his body as Tan Suit fires another burst.\n\nMore sparks light up the darkness, the bullets penetrating the\ncar with ease, narrowly missing Driver and Irene.\n\nDriver moves again, dragging the terrified Irene behind him. Tan\nSuit loses sight of them in the darkness, striding past rows of\nparked cars.\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n65\n9/24/10\n107 CONTINUED: (2) 107\n\nDriver turns to Irene as they take cover behind a pillar. She\nlooks terrified -- not just of Tan Suit but of him. It's as if\nall her worst fears have been confirmed.\n\nDriver stares back at her, then hears Tan Suit's footsteps\napproaching.\n\nHe holds her gaze apologetically, then gets to his feet and\nruns, trying to draw Tan Suit's fire.\n\nTan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up\nthe darkness. Driver keeps moving. Tan Suit strides after him,\nreloading, when suddenly his gun jams.\n\nCrouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his\nchance, darting out after his pursuer. Tan Suit sees him coming\nand runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now.\n\nStill lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing\nfootsteps.\n\nDriver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the\ntime. Tan Suit looks desperate now, tiring. He turns to face his\npursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a\ncar.\n\nTan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs\nhim, swinging him around, smashing him into another car.\n\nIrene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She\npicks herself up and runs towards the elevator.\n\nDriver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the\nresistance out of him. As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs\nhim by the throat and rams his head into a car window.\n\nThe glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering\nTan Suit's skull.\n\nDriver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the\nelevator, framed against the light.\n\nShe stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out.\n\nDriver stands there, his hands covered in Tan Suit's blood. The\nelevator doors finally close, hiding Irene from view.\n\n108 OMITTED 108\n\n108a EXT. LA STREET - NIGHT. 108a\n\nShannon gets out of his car. Driver is waiting for him by his\nown car, silhouetted against the streetlight. Shannon stares at\nhim a moment, then notices the blood stains on his shirt.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n66\n9/24/10\n108a CONTINUED: 108a\n\nSHANNON\nWhat happened?\n\nDRIVER\nNino's guys came after me. How did they\nknow about Irene?\n\nShannon takes a moment to reply, looking dazed.\n\nSHANNON\nI called Bernie...I asked if he could help.\nHim and Nino are like brothers. I told him\nyou weren't interested in the money, that\nyou only did it for the girl...\n(From the heart)\nI wanted to make sure once you returned the\nmoney that was the end of it...\n\nDriver doesn't seem to hear him.\n\nSHANNON\nLet me talk to Bernie again. They probably\ndidn't listen to him -\n\nDRIVER\nIt's too late...\n\nShannon says nothing now, knowing he's right.\n\nDRIVER\nThey're gonna come after you to find me.\nYou have to leave...\n\nShannon takes this in slowly.\n\nSHANNON\nWhat are you gonna do?...\n\nDriver doesn't answer, but from his silence Shannon can guess.\n\nSHANNON\nHow the fuck did this happen? We're\nsupposed be in Charlotte or Daytona\ndrinking champagne out of trophies and\ngetting laid by pit lizards...\n\nHe stares at Driver with quiet regret.\n\nSHANNON\nFuck...\n\n109 OMITTED 109\n67\n9/24/10\n\n\n\n\n110 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - MORNING. 110\n\nBernie Rose looks quietly furious.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\n...I already gave you my advice. You should\nhave taken your money and left this guy\nalone.\n\nNino and Cook sit opposite him, both of Cook's hands broken now.\n\nNINO\nIt's not that simple, Bernie.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nNot now that it's bounced up in your face.\n\nCOOK\nMr. Paolozzi, I owe you this guy. Just give\nme the okay and I'll -\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYou like taking orders, go shut the blinds.\n\nHe looks at Cook's broken hands.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nSun's in my eyes...\n\nNino doesn't look at Cook, a clear indication he should do as\nhe's told. Cook stands up, humiliated, and walks over to the\nwindows. Bernie Rose waits for Nino to explain.\n\nNINO\n...The money belonged to a half assed\nwiseguy from Philly. I had a tip-off he was\nkeeping a million in a pawn shop and was\ngonna invest it here in LA, try to run a\nrival operation. I wanted to teach him a\nlesson...\n\nThe lights in the restaurant gradually fade as Cook shuts the\nblinds.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\n(INCREDULOUSLY)\nYou stole from the East Coast mob?\n\nNINO\nI stole from a jumped up punk who was gonna\nstep on our business -\n\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n68\n9/24/10\n110 CONTINUED: 110\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nAnd where did this punk find a million\ndollars? You ever consider he may have\nconsulted some higher-ups? You even bother\nto check? -\n\nNINO\nI don't give a fuck who gave him their\nblessing. This is my city -\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYour city? This is a big city, pal, and\nlast time I checked we were partners! -\n\nNINO\nWe are partners -\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nThen why the fuck didn't you come to me\nbefore you set up your dummy robbery or\nhired this fucking amateur?!...\n\nCook sits back down at the table, having closed the blinds. Nino\nlooks almost embarrassed for once.\n\nNINO\nThis was off to the side, Bernie. I didn't\nwanna involve you.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nWell, now you fucked up I am involved.\nAnyone finds out you stole from the family\nthey'll kill both of us -\n\nNINO\nWhat family? These fucks still call me a\nkike to my face. I'm fifty nine years old,\nthey pinch my cheek, treat me like a\nfuckin' kid. They're the reason we left New\nYork in the first place. Decrepit old men\nwaving us over to their dinner and domino\ntables to complain.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nThose old men gave us the funds to move out\nhere.\n\nNINO\nAnd I made them a lotta money. I made you a\nlotta money too...\n\nHe stares at Bernie, genuinely indignant now.\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n69\n9/24/10\n110 CONTINUED: (2) 110\n\nNINO\nI pay them half of everything I fucking\nearn and then they set up some fucking kid\nfrom Philadelphia just because he's a\nfucking wop!\n\nThere's a hint of sympathy in Bernie's eyes.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nThe money always flows up, Izzy. You know\nthat.\n\nHe calls Nino by his childhood name now, emphasizing the fact\nthat they're both outsiders in this organization. For the first\ntime Nino's tough guy act slips and he looks anxious.\n\nNINO\nThat's why this driver has to go. Him, and\nmaybe your friend Shannon, are the only two\npeople who can tie me to the robbery.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nWhat about this prick?\n\nHe doesn't even bother to look at Cook.\n\nCOOK\nMr. Paolozzi -\n\nNINO\nShut up...\n\nThe two friends stare at each other as if Cook didn't exist.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nAre you asking my permission?\n\nNINO\nI'm asking for your help. I shoulda' come\nto you first, Bernie. I know that. We're a\nteam.\n\nHe stares at Bernie apologetically, appealing to their\nfriendship.\n\nNINO\nI'll pay you back the three hundred you\nspent on the race car.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nIt's not about the money...\n\nHe stares out quietly, torn.\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n70\n9/24/10\n110 CONTINUED: (3) 110\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nAll right...\n\nNino nods in gratitude.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\n(TO COOK)\nPass the salt...\n\nCook hesitates, thinking Bernie's fucking with him for having\ntwo broken hands. He stares back dumbly and it's the final\nstraw. Bernie suddenly grabs a stainless steel fork and rams it\nin his eye. As Cook screams, Bernie takes a knife and buries it\nin his neck. He twists the knife deeper for good measure, then\nwith one powerful sweep of his arm clears Cook off the table.\n\nCook's not dead yet, just writhing on the floor, choking on his\nown blood. Bernie Rose keeps his eyes fixed on Nino.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYour turn to clean up after me...\n\n110a EXT. TRAILER/ FILM SET/ SAN PEDRO/ LOS ANGELES - MORNING. 110a\n\nThe CREW are setting up for their first shot of the day. In the\nbackground we see a DIRECTOR blocking out an action scene.\nDriver walks past without even a glance, heading towards the\nmake-up trailer. He opens the door and walks in, looking around\nthe trailer until he finds what he's looking for -- the SFX mask\nhe saw previously on the film set.\n\n111 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ SILVERLAKE BOULEVARD - MORNING. 111\n\nShannon limps down the steps from his office with a suitcase in\nhis hand. He heads into the main garage then suddenly stops.\nBernie Rose stands beside the stock car, waiting for him.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nAll these priceless cars, you should get\nbetter locks...\n\nSHANNON\nDoor's always open to you...\n\nBernie Rose heads towards him with his hands in his coat\npockets.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nGoing somewhere?\n\nSHANNON\nThinking about it.\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n71\n9/24/10\n111 CONTINUED: 111\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nI'm looking for your driver.\n\nSHANNON\nYou break in like this I figure it's bad\nnews.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nIt's bad luck. Two thousand heists in this\ncity a year, he had to pick the wrong one.\n\nSHANNON\nHe tried to put it right.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nPicked the wrong guy for that too. My\npartner's a belligerent asshole with his\nback against the wall...\n\nHe stops, facing Shannon.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nRight now so am I. I don't take care of\nthis I'm in big trouble...\n\nHe stares at his old friend.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nAny idea where he is?\n\nSHANNON\nProbably across the border by now. Mexico.\nBelize. That's where I'd go...\n\nBernie Rose smiles, not believing a word.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nHe just walked out on you after everything\nyou've done for him, took all the money?\n\nSHANNON\nThat's gratitude, I guess.\n\nBernie Rose can't help grinning, fond of Shannon despite\neverything.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nI ever tell you how long Izzy and I been\nfriends? Since we were six. Only Jews in a\nneighborhood of wops. Long as I can\nremember he was getting me into trouble and\nI was getting him out of scrapes...\n\nHe looks almost apologetic.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n72\n9/24/10\n111 CONTINUED: (2) 111\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nAnyone else I'd take your side...\n\nSHANNON\nAnyone else I'd do the same...\n\nBernie Rose watches him with a mixture of affection and regret.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nWhat's this fucking kid to you anyway?\n\nShannon shrugs, no idea himself.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nI leave here without finding out where he\nis, there'll be others coming after me. I\nguarantee they'll be too stupid to figure\nout you won't talk and drag this out\nunnecessarily...\n\nSHANNON\nThen I'm glad you got here first...\n\nBernie Rose holds his gaze, then looks away, admiring the shiny\nstock car.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYou know, it's too bad, I was getting\nexcited about our race team, having my name\nall over the car. I think we could have\nmade something of this business...\n\nSHANNON\nNah, I'd have fucked it up too...\n\nShannon smiles, reconciled with himself. Bernie Rose grins, and\nextends his hand. They shake hands firmly, like old friends,\nwhen suddenly Shannon recoils, as if he's been stung.\n\nWe see now that his shirt sleeve is covered in blood, his vein\ncut all the way from his elbow to his wrist. He looks dazed,\nparalysed with shock.\n\nBernie Rose holds a razor knife in his hand, the blade wet with\nShannon's blood. He takes Shannon gently by the arm and sits him\ndown against the boot of the stock car.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYou won't feel a thing. Close your eyes and\nyou'll fall asleep...\n\nShannon stares out numbly, the life ebbing out of him. Bernie\nRose watches him quietly, wiping his bloody razor with a\nhandkerchief.\n73\n9/24/10\n\n\n\n\n111a INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT - DAY. 111a\n\nBernie Rose replaces the razor knife in a small lacquered box\nfull of other knives. From next door he can hear his neighbors\narguing again. He stands there a moment, deflated, then suddenly\nstorms towards his front door.\n\n111b EXT. CORRIDOR/ BERNIE ROSE'S NEIGHBORS' APARTMENT - DAY. 111b\n\nA loud knocking. Bernie Rose's neighbor opens his door.\n\nHUSBAND\nYeah?\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nBernie Rose, next apartment over -\n\nHUSBAND\nYeah, I know. I'm kind of busy here.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nI heard...\n\nThere's something threatening in the old mobster's eyes now. The\nhusband moves to close the door but Bernie jams it open with his\nelbow, shoves him aside, then looks over at the wife.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYou all right, Shonda?\n\nThe woman nods without meeting his eyes.\n\nHUSBAND\nGet the hell out of my -\n\nBernie doesn't give him time to finish, clamping a powerful hand\non his throat.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nWhat's your fucking name?\n\nHUSBAND\nLENNY -\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nI'm a patient man, Lenny, not much for\ngetting in other people's way. What I\nfigure is, we've all got our own lives,\nright? And the right to be left alone?\n(SQUEEZING HARDER)\nSo I sit next door for almost a year now\nlistening to what goes down in here and I\nkeep thinking, hey, they'll work it out.\nYou gonna work it out, Lenny?\n\n(CONTINUED)\n74\n9/24/10\n111b CONTINUED: 111b\n\nHe jerks the husband's neck forward, making him nod.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYou're lucky to have her, lucky she's put\nup with you this long. Lucky I've put up\nwith you. She has good reason: she loves\nyou. I don't have any reason at all. So\nstop raising your voice or fucking move...\n\nHe lets go of the terrified man and storms out again.\n\n112 INT/ EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ RESEDA BOULEVARD - DAY. 112\n\nSunlight glints on the parked vehicles by the curb. Driver slows\ndown as he approaches the sign for Shannon's Custom Kings,\nglancing out of the window to see if anyone's staking out the\ngarage. Satisfied there's no-one there, he drives through.\n\n113 INT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ RESEDA BOULEVARD - DAY. 113\n\nDriver pulls open the garage door and sees the rows of vintage\ncars shimmering in the shafts of sunlight. As he heads past the\nvehicles he suddenly spots a figure slumped against the stock\ncar. Shannon's eyes have been closed, his head resting gently\nagainst the trunk of the car.\n\nDriver kneels down and lifts him up in his arms, holding him for\na second, then lays him down on the floor. He turns back and\nopens the car boot now, revealing the black gym bag full of\nmoney.\n\n114 EXT. SHANNON'S GARAGE/ RESEDA BOULEVARD - DAY. 114\n\nDriver's car roars out of the garage.\n\n115 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 115\n\nNino stands in the kitchen, wearing a beautiful suit but no\nshoes or socks, listening on his cell phone. We hold on the\ncurious image for a moment, then reveal a beautifully dressed\nWOMAN polishing his shoes. And now we see more of Nino's MEN,\nalso smartly dressed and accompanied by GORGEOUS WOMEN, getting\nready for an event. Nino's talking to his wife on the phone.\n\nNINO\nAlright honey, I'll pick you up in an hour.\n\n116 EXT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 116\n\nTwo big Lincoln Towncars are parked outside. Across the road we\nrecognize Driver's car. He opens the trunk. When he closes it\nagain we see that he's wearing the eerily convincing SFX mask.\nHe crosses the road, entering the pizzeria.\n75\n9/24/10\n\n\n\n\n117 INT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - SUNSET. 117\n\nSeveral of Nino's men look up as Driver enters but none of them\nrecognize him.\n\nNINO'S GUY\nWe're closed...\n\nDriver stares past them at Nino in the kitchen, surrounded by\nmore of his men. We feel his mind calculating then he walks out\nagain.\n\n118 EXT. NINO'S PIZZERIA - NIGHT. 118\n\nNino emerges with his bodyguards now, heading towards one of the\nwhite Lincolns.\n\nNINO\n(To one of his men)\nI'm going to pick up my wife.

PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 155\n\nDriver gets out of his car, calmly walking over to the\npulverized Lincoln. He sees Nino stumbling off towards the beach\nbut doesn't hurry after him yet. He checks to make sure the\nother passengers are dead, then heads on.\n\n156 EXT. BEACH/ OCEAN/ PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT. 156\n\nNino stumbles through the sand, running for his life now. He\nlooks behind him and sees Driver calmly pursuing him. He keeps\nrunning, but he's badly injured, slowing all the time. Fear\nclouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves.\n\nDriver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the\nocean, a pathetic last attempt to evade him. The crashing waves\nand the undertow are an impenetrable wall. Every time Nino tries\nto wade out further, the ocean drags him back.\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n80\n9/24/10\n156 CONTINUED: 156\n\nDriver stares at his trapped prey. Nino's attempts become more\nand more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any\nhope of escape. Finally he retreats back into the shallow water,\nbarely able to keep his footing. He turns around and faces\nDriver, the crashing waves still smashing into his back.\n\nThey stay like that for a moment. Gazing at each other. Driver\nsilhouetted against the white sand. Nino trapped in the ocean.\nThen Driver wades out into the water. Nino has no fight left in\nhim, staring at the masked man. Driver stares back at him then\ngrabs him by the throat, forcing his head under the water. Nino\nsplutters as Driver lets him up again.\n\nNINO\nIt was Bernie...Bernie Rose killed your\nfriend not me...\n\nDriver shoves his face back under the water, keeping it there\nuntil Nino's body finally stops thrashing.\n\n157 INT. BERNIE ROSE'S APARTMENT/ BEL AIR - NIGHT. 157\n\nA phone shrills. Bernie Rose answers it.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nNino?\n\nDRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\nHe's dead.\n\nBernie Rose stares out in silence. Whatever he thinks of Nino, a\npart of him has died. We feel the regret in his eyes but there's\nno trace of emotion in his voice.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nLooks like me, you and your girlfriend are\nthe only pieces left on the board...\n\n158 EXT. BEACH/ OCEAN - NIGHT. 158\n\nDriver is no longer wearing a mask, framed against the ocean. He\ncatches the veiled threat in Bernie's words but doesn't respond.\n\nINTERCUT\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nI'd say this has gone far enough. See any\nreason why it should go on?...\n\nDRIVER\nDoesn't have to...\n\n\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n81\n9/24/10\n158 CONTINUED: 158\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nThen we should talk. You know a place\ncalled the Great Wall -- out on Sherman\nWay?\n\nDRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\nI can find it.\n\nBernie pauses, staring out.\n\nBERNIE'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\nI'll see you there at one.\n\nA charged silence, then the line goes dead.\n\n159 OMITTED 159\n\n160 INT. GREAT WALL RESTAURANT/ LINCOLN BOULEVARD - DAY. 160\n\nA large Chinese restaurant. We follow Driver through the crowd.\nHe sees Bernie Rose sitting at a table on his own, pouring\nhimself a glass of wine. The mobster's dressed for the occasion,\nwearing a jacket and tie. He smiles at Driver as he sits down.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nCare for a glass?...\n\nDriver doesn't smile, gazing back at him across the table.\nBernie Rose doesn't seem to care.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nI can recommend the duck. Hell, I can\nrecommend everything -- Walnut prawns,\nshredded beef, Velvet chicken -- but the\nduck's to die for...\n\nHe delivers the last line with a pointed smile, then turns away,\ncalling over a WAITRESS.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nThe duck, please. For two.\n\nWAITRESS\nAnything else?\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nNo, thanks...\n\nHe waits for the waitress to leave, then turns back to Driver.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYou've been on a roll. Cut yourself quite a\nswath out there.\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n82\n9/24/10\n160 CONTINUED: 160\n\nDRIVER\nI never asked for any of it.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nWe usually don't. But it comes down on our\nheads regardless. Look at Shannon...\n\nDriver holds his gaze, the tension palpable, laughter and\nconversation drifting over from the other tables.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nAnyway it's water under the bridge now.\nQuestion is where does that leave us?\n\nDRIVER\nThat's up to you.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nYou bring the cash?\n\nDriver nods. Bernie Rose studies him quietly.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nTell me something, how does someone with no\ninterest in money get mixed up in a heist?\n(Off his silence)\nShannon told me it was because of the girl?\n\nDriver hesitates, betraying a hint of concern. Bernie sees it\nand smiles.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nDon't worry. Nobody else knows about her.\nJust me...\n(A BEAT)\nYou still see her?...\n\nDRIVER\nShe's not interested.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nShe's got her head screwed on right. I got\ntwo ex-wives, three kids, four\ngrandchildren. Not one of them speaks to me\nnow...\n\nHe smiles again, looking into Driver's eyes with just a hint of\nsympathy.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nThis is what I'll do for you. You give me\nthe money, nobody knows she exists. But\nit's a different matter with you.\n(MORE)\n\n(CONTINUED)\n83\n9/24/10\n160 CONTINUED: (2) 160\nBERNIE ROSE (cont'd)\nThese people I have the misfortune to be\ninvolved with, they don't mind Nino being\ngone, but they'll wanna know what happened\nto him...\n\nDRIVER\nSounds like we have a problem...\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nAnd just when we were getting to know each\nother...\n\nTheir eyes are fixed on each other, deadly enemies but kindred\nspirits of a kind.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\n...We shake hands, say goodbye, it's the\nstart of your new life. Sooner or later\nthey'll come after you. No end to it.\nSomeone gets tired, somebody else takes\ntheir place. It goes on and on. Whatever\ndreams you have, whatever plans, you might\nas well forget `em, because this is what\nit's gonna be like till the day you die...\n(A BEAT)\nI just thought you should know...\n\nDriver stares back at him quietly.\n\nDRIVER\nWhat do you suggest I do?\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nFirst time I heard about you, Shannon told\nme you drove. Fast. That's a start...\n\nHe keeps staring at Driver, then smiles.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nEither that or you choke on the duck...\n\n161 EXT. PARKING LOT/ LINCOLN BOULEVARD - DAY. 161\n\nDriver's car is parked at the back of the parking lot, half\nhidden by a fenced area for garbage. Driver pops the trunk,\ntaking out the black gym bag with the cash. Bernie Rose doesn't\neven look at it, still admiring the car.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nHow much does something like this cost?\n\nDRIVER\nNine, ten thousand. If you can find one\nthat still runs.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n84\n9/24/10\n161 CONTINUED: 161\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nMaybe I'll take yours. Part of our deal.\n\nHe grins, then holds out his hand for the gym bag.\n\nBERNIE ROSE\nGuess we won't be seeing each other again..\n\nDriver reaches out to give him the bag, when suddenly Bernie's\nhand snakes out of his pocket, twisting a switch-blade into\nDriver's gut. He pulls it out, ready to stab again, but this\ntime Driver catches his wrist, slowly forcing the knife up to\nhis throat.\n\nTheir eyes are fixed on each other for a moment, with something\nlike regret, then the blade pierces Bernie Rose's neck, sinking\ndeeper and deeper. Driver holds the old man in his arms as he\ndies. They stay like that, locked in a fatal embrace, then\nDriver lowers Bernie Rose gently to the ground, out of sight.\n\nBlood seeping through his shirt, Driver picks up the gym bag and\nputs it back in the trunk, slamming the door shut.\n\n162 EXT. AERIAL VIEW OF A MUCH LARGER PARKING LOT/ LA - DAY. 162\n\nWe're looking down on an enormous parking lot, hundreds of\ndifferent colored vehicles gleaming down below. Driver pulls\ninto the lot, searching for a place to park.\n\n163 EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT/ LA - DAY. 163\n\nDriver climbs out of his car, wearing a jacket over his blood-\nsoaked shirt. He walks to the back of the car, kneels down, and\nhides the keys behind the left rear wheel, drops of blood\ndripping on the tarmac beneath him. He gets up again, then sets\noff through the maze of parked vehicles, dialling a number on\nhis cell-phone.\n\n164 EXT. ECHO PARK - DAY. 164\n\nIrene and Benicio sit in the park.\n\nIRENE\n(Picking up her phone)\nHello?...\n\n(INTERCUT)\n\nThe blazing sun beats down. Driver walks through a long corridor\nof glinting cars.\n\nDRIVER\nIt's me...\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n85\n9/24/10\n164 CONTINUED: 164\n\nIrene stares in surprise.\n\nDRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\nDon't hang up...\n\nShe says nothing but stays on the line.\n\nDriver continues painfully through the maze of cars.\n\nDRIVER\nYou got a pen? I need you to write\nsomething down...\n\nIrene looks confused as she hears the quiet urgency in his\nvoice, then reaches inside her handbag.\n\nSunlight glitters on the roofs of the parked cars, dazzling\nDriver's eyes.\n\nDRIVER\n...JJT 108...\n\nIRENE'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\n...JJT 108...\n\nDRIVER\nIt's the license number for my car. I've\nleft it in a parking lot on the corner of\nCulver and Lincoln. Section M 10...\n\nIrene writes down the details, looking even more confused.\n\nDRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE\nThere's a bag in the trunk with some money.\nKeys are under the left rear wheel...\n\nIRENE\nWhat do you want me to do with it?...\n\nDriver walks with difficulty, finding it hard to breathe.\n\nDRIVER\nIt's yours. It's safe to keep it...\n\nAll around him the Chevys, Dodges, and Fords glitter in the\nsunlight.\n\nIRENE\nI told you, I don't need your money...\n\nBlood seeps through Driver's shirt, dripping on the tarmac.\n\nIrene hears his labored breathing now, looking concerned.\n\n\n(CONTINUED)\n86\n9/24/10\n164 CONTINUED: (2) 164\n\nIRENE\nAre you okay?...\n\nDriver's skin looks deathly pale, his eyes a haunting shade of\nblue. He keeps walking through the maze of cars, casting his\neyes from one vehicle to the next, looking for the perfect ride.\n\nDRIVER\nJust out of breath...\n\nFinally he spots a beautiful white Camaro up ahead.\n\nDRIVER\nHow're you doing?...\n\nFor the first time we see the Echo Park fountain sparkling in\nthe background.\n\nIRENE\nFine. I'm in the park with Benicio...\n\nIrene can no longer hold back her tears, heartbroken.\n\nDriver stops in front of the white Camaro, unsteady on his feet.\n\nDRIVER\nI gotta go Irene...\n\nHe pauses.\n\nDRIVER\nMeeting you was the best thing that ever\nhappened to me...\n\nIrene smiles sadly.\n\nIRENE\nIt was nice to meet you too...\n\n165 EXT. LARGE PARKING LOT/ LA - DAY. 165\n\nFrom above we see the maze of vehicles stretching out forever --\nChevys, Chryslers, Fords -- the history of America on wheels.\nDriver switches off his cell-phone reluctantly then heads\ntowards the Camaro.\n\n166 INT. WHITE CAMARO/ LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY. 166\n\nDriver climbs into the front seat of the Camaro, catching his\nbreath. He sits there a moment, sheltering from the world\noutside, then pulls out a pocket knife, opening the blades until\nhe finds the screwdriver. He starts with the left side of the\nsteering column, then gets to work on the section below the turn\nsignal.\n\n(CONTINUED)\n87\n9/24/10\n166 CONTINUED: 166\n\nHis face shows the strain, but his fingers are as steady as\never. A master at work. Finally he breaks into the ignition\ndevice, leaning back in the seat to take a rest.\n\n167 EXT. AERIAL VIEW/ LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY. 167\n\nWe're gazing down at the white Camaro from above, waiting for it\nto move.\n\n168 INT. WHITE CAMARO/ LARGE PARKING LOT - DAY. 168\n\nDriver's face is completely still now. So are his eyes. He looks\nalmost at peace. There's a long pause, then slowly he leans\nforward and turns on the ignition. As the engine comes to life,\nwe CUT TO BLACK.\n\n\n\tDriveEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1585396", "artist_names": "Connie Francis", "full_title": "Mama by\u00a0Connie\u00a0Francis", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/de66fbf47fbc2bd7707da360bf89a960.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/de66fbf47fbc2bd7707da360bf89a960.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 1585396, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429898535, "path": "/Connie-francis-mama-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Connie-francis-mama-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/de66fbf47fbc2bd7707da360bf89a960.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/de66fbf47fbc2bd7707da360bf89a960.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Mama", "title_with_featured": "Mama", "updated_by_human_at": 1656342062, "url": "https://genius.com/Connie-francis-mama-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/332977", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f15227db8eec9a678b0b23af026068d7.1000x668x1.jpg", "id": 332977, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d9783b8640e2d20de03c8ed83e93a90c.715x715x1.jpg", "index_character": "c", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Connie Francis", "slug": "Connie-francis", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Connie-francis"}, "artist": "Connie Francis", "lyrics": "Mama LyricsWhen the evening shadows fall\nAnd the lovely day is through\nThen with longing I recall\nThe years I spent with you\n\nMama, I miss the days\nWhen you were near to guide me\nMama, those happy days\nWhen you were here beside me\n\nSafe in the glow of your love\nSent from the heavens above\nNothing can ever replace\nThe warmth of your tender embrace\nOh, Mama, until the day\nThat we're together once more\nI'll live in these memories\nUntil the day that we're together once moreYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2230645", "artist_names": "Johnny & The Hurricanes", "full_title": "Beatnik Fly by\u00a0Johnny\u00a0& The Hurricanes", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/3367160f9ea0d588b5274b15b6417f36.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3367160f9ea0d588b5274b15b6417f36.518x518x1.jpg", "id": 2230645, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1437083098, "path": "/Johnny-and-the-hurricanes-beatnik-fly-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Johnny-and-the-hurricanes-beatnik-fly-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/3367160f9ea0d588b5274b15b6417f36.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3367160f9ea0d588b5274b15b6417f36.518x518x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Beatnik Fly", "title_with_featured": "Beatnik Fly", "updated_by_human_at": 1447115205, "url": "https://genius.com/Johnny-and-the-hurricanes-beatnik-fly-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/374146", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3367160f9ea0d588b5274b15b6417f36.518x518x1.jpg", "id": 374146, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3367160f9ea0d588b5274b15b6417f36.518x518x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Johnny & The Hurricanes", "slug": "Johnny-and-the-hurricanes", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Johnny-and-the-hurricanes"}, "artist": "Johnny & The Hurricanes", "lyrics": "Beatnik Fly LyricsPd... \u00ae1960; Us Ht#25 ...Pd\nPd... {\u266b Instrum \u266b} ...Pd\n...Pd...You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 68, "api_path": "/songs/467848", "artist_names": "Alun Owen (Ft.

The boys hare off just ahead of them. They take a turn down a back alley way and the crowds of screaming girls are after them.\n\n2.\tEXT. TERMINAL\n\nThey rush on through the narrow cobbled passageway and into the main station, quickly show their tickets at the barrier for the London train, and get onto the platform as hordes of yelling and screaming girls reach the closed gates.\n\n3.\tEXT. TERMINAL PLATFORM\n\nWe see the fans rushing to the few platform ticket machines, and endless pennies being dropped and tickets torn out in their haste to get onto the platform to see the boys.\nNORM has been waiting for the boys and he hurries them to where all their baggage, instruments and the drums are waiting, piled up to be put into the guards' van. The boys turn and see the oncoming stream of girls pushing through the barriers and descending on them with yells and shouts. They grab their instruments, RINGO makes for the drums. NORM plugs into a handy transformer and using their instruments like a gun volley to stop the onrush of females, the boys blast fire into a number and start to sing. This stops the girls in their tracks and they settle down on whatever they can to listen to them playing.\n\nAs the boys are playing, we CUT BACK into the crowds. In the centre we see PAUL struggling and pulling to fight his way through the girls to join the other boys. He is dragging a very reluctant old man behind him. The old man seems most disgruntled and we can see by his gestures how unwilling he is to be pulled and pushed forward through all the girls.\n\nAt last PAUL reaches the other boys. He sits the old man down on a pile of cases and joins in the number to the squeals of delight from the fans. The old man sits aloof and proud ignoring the whole proceedings. JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO look enquiringly at PAUL who gives a noncommittal shrug of the shoulders as if to say, \"it's not my fault\" and the number proceeds.\n\nSHOT of sudden horror on JOHN's face. PAUL follows his eye line only to see the old man has doffed his cap and is busily collecting money from a disconcerted crowd. PAUL dives hastily into the crowd, and with suitable apologies extracts the old man and with a long suffering sigh drags him back to the group. GEORGE and PAUL hold him firmly as they finish the number, the old man standing there between them.\n\nAs the number finishes and the girls scream and shout with delight, the guard blows his whistle. NORM and SHAKE grab the instruments and the drums, and with the rest piles the lot into the guards' van. The BOYS head into their reserved compartment pursued by the fans but the train moves off. They have successfully repelled all extra boarders.\n\nTHE BOYS stand and wave to the fans until out of sight line ... the girls running along to the end of the platform waving and calling out.\n\n4.\tINTERIOR  RESERVED COMPARTMENT IN THE TRAIN\n\nThe boys relax, sitting down on one side of the compartment. They are about to settle down and make themselves at home when first RINGO nudges GEORGE who in turn nudges JOHN. Opposite them is sitting the LITTLE OLD MAN. He is holding himself stiff, erect and very aloof.\n\nThe three boys look at him enquiringly but with an elaborate sniff he looks away from them and out of the window.\n\nPAUL catches his eye and winks at the LITTLE OLD MAN. He winks back at PAUL, scowls at the other three then looks firmly out of the window again.\n\nThe boys turn on PAUL crowding around him.\n\nJOHN\nEh ... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?\n\nPAUL\nWhat little old man?\nJOHN\n(pointing)\nThat little old man.\n\nPAUL\nOh, that one. That's me Grandfather.\n\nGEORGE\nThat's not your Grandfather.\n\nPAUL\nIt is, y'know.\n\nGEORGE\nBut your Grandfather lives in your house. I've seen him.\n\nPAUL\nOh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.\n\nJOHN\nHow d'you reckon that one out?\n\nPAUL\nWell ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.\n\nJOHN\n(long suffering)\nWell we know that but what's he doing here?\nPAUL\nWell, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.\n\nRINGO\nHow's that?\n\nPAUL\nOh ... he's nursing a broken heart.\n\nThe lads all look intently at the GRANDFATHER.\n\nJOHN\nAah ... the poor old thing.\n\nHe leans across to GRANDFATHER.\n\nJOHN\nEh, Mister... are you nursing a broken heart then?\n\nThe GRANDFATHER nods soulfully glares at him, in a way that indicates yes.\n\nPAUL\n(whispering)\nYou see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.\n\nGEORGE\nA butcher?\n\nPAUL\nYeah, she was fickle.\n\nJOHN\nAye and fond of fresh meat and all.\n\nPAUL\n(seriously)\nNo ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.\n\nJOHN\nOh, I see.\n\nHe inspects GRANDFATHER carefully.\n\nJOHN\n(to PAUL)\nEh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?\n\nPAUL\nOh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.\n\nThey all agree with PAUL.\n\nJOHN has been examining GRANDFATHER. He now leans forward to him.\n\nJOHN\n(in an over-friendly voice)\nHello, Grandfather!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHello.\n\nJOHN\n(delightedly)\nHe can talk then?\n\nPAUL\n(indignantly)\nCourse he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?\n\nRINGO\n(grinning)\nWell ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?\n\nThe lads all laugh.\n\nJOHN\nAnd we're looking after him, are we?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI'll look after meself.\n\nPAUL\nAye, that's what I'm afraid of!\n\nJOHN\nHe's got you worried, then?\n\nPAUL\nHim, he costs you a fortune in breach-of-promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.\n\nGEORGE\n(disbelieving)\nGerron.\n\nPAUL\nNo, straight up.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThe lad's given you the simple truth. I'm cursed wid irresistible charm, I'm too attractive to be let loose.\n\nAt this moment, SHAKE, a tall man who works with the BOYS, pulls open the door of the compartment.\n\nSHAKE\nYou got on all right then?\n\nBOYS\nHi, Shake.\n\nSHAKE\nWe're here. Norm'll be along in a mo' with the tickets.\n\nHe sees GRANDFATHER.\n\nSHAKE\nMorning!\n(whispers)\nWho's that little old man?\n\nGEORGE\nIt's Paul's grandfather.\n\nSHAKE\nOh aye, but I thought ...\n\nJOHN\n(cutting in)\nNo, that's his other one.\n\nSHAKE\nThat's all right then.\n\nJOHN\n(displaying Grandfather)\nClean though, isn't he?\n\nSHAKE\nOh yes, he's clean all right.\n\nNORM the road manager appears behind SHAKE.\n\nNORM\nMorning, lads.\n\nBOYS\nMorning ... Hi, Norm.\n\nNORM\n(checking them quickly)\nWell, thank God you're all got here. Now, listen, I've had this marvellous idea ... now just for a change, let's all behave like ordinary responsible citizens. Let's not cause any trouble, pull any strokes or do anything I'm going to be sorry for, especially tomorrow at the television theatre, because ...\n\nHe looks sharply at JOHN who is polishing his nails.\n\nNORM\nAre you listening to me, Lennon?\n\nJOHN\n(off-hand)\nYou're a swine, isn't he George?\n\nGEORGE\n(disinterested)\nYeah ... a swine.\n\nNORM\n(just as indifferent)\nThanks...\n\nHe sees the GRANDFATHER.\n\nNORM\nEh ... .\n\nBOYS IN CHORUS\n... Who's that little old man?\n\nNORM\nWell, who is he?\n\nRINGO\nHe belongs to Paul.\n\nNORM\n(accepting the situation)\nAh well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?\n\nPAUL\nWe'll follow you down.\n\nGRANDFATHER rises.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI want me coffee.\n\nNORM\nHe can come with Shake and me if you like.\n\nPAUL\nWell, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.\n\nNORM\nDon't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.\n\nGRANDFATHER joins SHAKE and NORM.\n\nNORM\n(over Grandfather's head)\nHe's very clean, isn't he?\n\nSHAKE and NORM collect GRANDFATHER and are in the process of leaving the compartment when a fat upper class city Englishman, JOHNSON, attempts to enter. There is a bit of confusion and they get tangled up with each other.\n\nJOHNSON\nMake up your minds, will you!\n\nAt last SHAKE, NORM and GRANDFATHER sort themselves out and JOHNSON enters with his case. The other three go to coffee.\n\nJOHNSON puts his case up on the luggage rack, then sits down. All his movements are disgruntled ... he finally picks up his copy of the Financial Times and burying himself behind it, starts to read. After a moment he looks up, notices the compartment window is open. He gets up and without so much as a \"by your leave\" he closes it, glares at the BOYS and sits down again.\n\nThe boys exchange looks as if to say ... \"Hello, Saucy!!\"\n\nPAUL\n(politely)\nDo you mind if we have it opened?\n\nJOHNSON\n(briefly)\nYes, I do.\n\nJOHN\nYeah, but there are four of us, like, and we'd like it open, if it's all the same to you, that is.\n\nJOHNSON\n(rudely)\nWell, it isn't. I travel on this train regularly twice a week, so I suppose I've some rights.\n\nRINGO\nAye, well, so have we.\n\nHe disappears behind his paper before the BOYS can say another word.\n\nRINGO pulls a face at the raised paper and switches on his portable radio. A pop number is playing.\n\nJOHNSON puts down his paper firmly.\n\nJOHNSON\nAnd we'll have that thing off as well, thank you.\n\nRINGO\nBut I ...\n\nJOHNSON leans over and switches it off.\n\nJOHNSON\nAn elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts would tell you I'm perfectly within my rights.\n\nHe smiles frostily.\n\nPAUL\nYeah, but we want to hear it and there's more of us than you. We're a community, like, a majority vote. Up the workers and all that stuff!\n\nJOHNSON\nThen I suggest you take that damned thing into the corridor or some other part of the train where you obviously belong.\n\nJOHN\n(leaning forward to him)\nGie's a kiss!\n\nPAUL\nShurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.\n\nJOHNSON\nI travel on this train regularly, twice a week.\n\nJOHN\nKnock it off, Paul, y' can't win with his sort. After all, it's his train, isn't it, Mister?\n\nJOHNSON\nAnd don't you take that tone with me, young man!\n\nGEORGE\nBut...\n\nJOHNSON\n(accusingly)\nI fought the war for your sort.\n\nRINGO\nBet you're sorry you won!\n\nJOHNSON\nI'll call the guard!\n\nPAUL\nAye ... but what? They don't take kindly to insults you know. Ah, come on, you lot. Let's get a cup of coffee and leave Toby the manger.\n\nThe boys troop out of the door into the corridor. JOHNSON smiles triumphantly. He is about to settle down to his paper when there is a tap on the corridor window. He looks up and we see pressed against the window a collection of hideous Beatle faces.\n\nPAUL\nEh, Mister ... can we have our ball back!\n\nThe man jumps to his feet.\n\n\n5.\tINTERIOR  OF THE CORRIDOR\n\nThe boys run away like a pack of school boys and disappear round the corner.\n\n\n6.\tINTERIOR OF THE TRAIN CORRIDOR\n\nFrom the P.O.V. of the door leading to the restaurant car.\n\nThe boys come down the corridor in full flight, laughing away like happy idiots. GEORGE and PAUL pull open the sliding doors. The boys look inside.\n\n7.\tINTERIOR  RESTAURANT CAR\n\nFrom their P.O.V. we see the car is half empty and at a table in the centre SHAKE and NORM and GRANDFATHER are sitting. On the table is a pile of photos of the boys. NORM and SHAKE are arguing. NORM is being very aggressive, much to SHAKE's discomfort.\n\nNORM\nYeah, you want to watch it.\n\nSHAKE\n(unhappily)\nIt's not my fault.\n\nNORM\nWell, you stick to that story, son.\n\nSHAKE\nI can't help it, I'm just taller than you.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(To NORM slyly)\nThey always say that.\n\nNORM\nYeah, well I got me eye on you.\n\nSHAKE\nI'm sorry Norm, but I can't help being taller\nthan you.\n\nNORM\nWell, you don't have to rub me nose in it. I've a good mind to ...\n(he is about to thump SHAKE.)\n\nJOHN\n(enjoying himself)\nIf you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.\n\nNORM\nHe started it.\n\nSHAKE\nNo, I didn't you did ...\n\nGEORGE\nWell, what happened?\n\nSHAKE\nThe old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldn't have 'em, all I said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'\n\nPAUL\nAnd?\n\nNORM\nYour Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.\n\nPAUL\nI knew it, he started it, I should have known.\n\nNORM\nY'what?\n\nPAUL\nYou two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.\n\nThe BOYS, i.e., JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO, look at each other then at PAUL.\n\nPAUL\nAye and we'll have to watch it and all.\n\nGEORGE\nI suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.\n\nNORM\nYou're right. Here you are, old devil.\n\nSHAKE and NORM leave. GRANDFATHER grins triumphantly and collects them, then with a sweet smile he turns to PAUL.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWould you ever sign this one for us, Pauly?\n\nPAUL does so automatically but in the middle of signing he gets suspicious. GRANDFATHER smiles at him charmingly so PAUL finishes signing.\n\nJOHN\nCome on let's get this coffee.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nBefore you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!\n\nJOHN, RINGO and GEORGE take this up straight away. They all pretend to be girls, RINGO jumps into PAUL's arms.\n\nGEORGE\n(coyly)\nOh, Paul, you can't have your own way!!!\n\nJOHN\n(invitingly, in a Marlene Dietrich voice)\nIf I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?\n\nPAUL\n(choked)\nI'll murder you, Grandfather!\n\nJOHN waltzes PAUL down to an empty table and the lads sit down.\n\nGEORGE\nEh, look at that talent.\n\nThey all gaze across the aisle. From their P.O.V. we see two very attractive young girls, RITA and JEAN, having coffee.\n\nJOHN\nGive 'em a pull.\n\nPAUL\nShall I?\n\nGEORGE\nAye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.\n\nPAUL\nNow what's that supposed to mean?\n\nGEORGE\n(grinning)\nI don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?\n\nJOHN\nGeorge Harrison, The Scouse of Distinction.\n\nWe follow PAUL as he crosses over to the two girls. He places a bowler on his head.\n\nPAUL\n(in posh accent)\nExcuse me, but these young men I'm sitting with wondered if two of us could join you; I'd ask you meself only I'm shy.\n\nThe two girls giggle together.\n\nJOHN and GEORGE are about to move over when GRANDFATHER suddenly appears by their sides.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(sternly)\nI'm sorry, miss, but you mustn't fraternise with my prisoners.\n\nJEAN\nPrisoners!!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nConvicts in transit to Wormwood Scrubs. Typical old lags, the lot of 'em.\n\nTHE BOYS\nY'what!!!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nQuiet, you lot, or I'll give you a touch of me truncheon.\n(He points at Ringo)\nThat little one's the worst. If we don't keep him on tablets he has fits.\n\nRINGO\n(protesting)\nNow look here!!\n\nGRANDFATHER grabs two lumps of sugar from the table and forces them into RINGO'S mouth.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nGet out while you can, ladies, his time's\ncoming round for one of his turns.\n\nThe frightened girls scurry out of the restaurant car. The boys look in amazement and horror at GRANDFATHER. They are completely flabbergasted. GRANDFATHER smiles at them benignly.\n\n\n8.\tINTERIOR OF RAILWAY COMPARTMENT\n\nSHAKE and NORM are seated. SHAKE is buried in a science fiction book.\n\nNORM looks at his watch, slightly worried.\n\nNORM\nHe's been gone a long time.\n\nSHAKE\n(without looking up)\nWho?\n\nNORM\nPaul's grandfather.\n\nSHAKE\nOh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?\n\nNORM\nDown the ... er ...\n\nSHAKE\nOh, down the ... er ...?\n\nNORM\nYeah, down the ... er ...\n\nSHAKE\nWell, give a couple of minutes ...\n\nHe resumes reading. But NORM goes on worrying.\n\n9.\tINTERIOR OF ANOTHER RAILWAY COMPARTMENT\n\nGrandfather is in full flight of conversation with a charming elderly lady, AUDREY, who is listening intently.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(proudly)\nYes, I'm their manager, I discovered them.\n\nLADY AUDREY\nDid you indeed, Mr. McCartney?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nNow, Audrey, I told you, the name's John. We show biz people are a friendly lot.\n\nAUDREY\nOf course, John.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. \"Mister, can you spare us a copper?\" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.\n\nAUDREY\nThe usual ten per cent?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nOh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?\n\nAUDREY\n(her eyes lighting up)\nHow fascinating. Do go on ...\n(pause)\n... John.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...\n\n10.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN\n\nNORM and SHAKE meet with the BOYS as they are returning from coffee.\n\nNORM\nEh, have you got Paul's grandfather?\n\nJOHN\nOf course, he's concealed about me person.\n\nNORM\nNo ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.\n\nPAUL\n(accusingly)\nHave you lost him?\n\nNORM\nDon't exaggerate.\n\nPAUL\nYou've lost him.\n\nSHAKE\nPut it this way, he's mislaid him.\n\nPAUL\nYou can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.\n\nSHAKE\nHe can't be far.\n\nJOHN\nI hope he fell off.\n\nPAUL\n(mildly)\nDon't be callous.\n\nRINGO\nHe doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.\n\nGEORGE\nYou've got an inferiority complex, you have.\n\nRINGO\nYeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.\n\nJOHN and PAUL run down the corridor. SHAKE and NORM turn from the door and go in the opposite direction, GEORGE and RINGO follow after the other two boys.\n\n11.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR OF TRAIN\n\nPAUL and JOHN look into various compartments. CLOSE SHOT of RINGO looking into compartments in the manner of Groucho Marx. In one of the compartments we see from RINGO'S P.O.V. the occupant, a glamorous woman, TANIA, with a small lap dog.\n\nShe is beautifully and most expensively dressed. She looks up and sees RINGO.\n\nRINGO smiles at her and she smiles back. She then beckons him to join her.\n\nHe looks around to see if she means someone else. She nods a negative. RINGO looks back enquiringly then points at himself as if to say: \"Who, me?\"\n\nTANIA smiles enthusiastically.\n\nGEORGE has been watching all this.\n\nGEORGE\nAre you going in?\n\nRINGO\nNo, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.\n\nGEORGE\nYou never know, you might be lucky this time.\n\nRINGO\nNo, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.\n\nHe blows the glamorous lady a kiss, then moves sadly on.\n\n12.\tINTERIOR  FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR\n\nPAUL enters a compartment followed by JOHN. The TWO GIRLS, RITA and JEAN, from the restaurant car are sitting there.\n\nPAUL\nExcuse me but have you seen that little old man we were with?\n\nThe girls jump up, surprised.\n\nJOHN\nWe've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!\n(he extends his hands as if handcuffed)\nEh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.\n\nPAUL\nWill you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...\n\nHe starts to drag JOHN after him.\n\nJOHN\nI was innocent. I was framed. I won't go back.\n\nJOHN is now by the door; he leers at the girls horribly.\n\nJOHN\nI bet you can guess what I was in for.\n\nHe cackles like a maniac before disappearing, the door closing after him.\n\nA waiter carrying a tray with champagne and glasses on it passes into one of the compartments with the blinds down.\n\nPAUL\nHow about that one?\n\nHe moves towards the compartment.\n\nPAUL\n(to Ringo and George)\nDid you look in here?\n\nGEORGE\nNo. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.\n\nPAUL\nWell, let's broaden our outlook.\n\nPAUL opens the door of the compartment.\n\n13.\tINTERIOR OF COMPARTMENT\n\nFrom the BOYS' P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER and the elderly lady, AUDREY, sipping champagne and nibbling caviar on toast.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(looking up)\nCongratulate me, boys, I'm engaged.\n\nPAUL enters and crosses over to him.\n\nPAUL\nOh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nIt's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.\n\nPAUL\nOh, well that's all right.\n(realising)\nWhat?\n\nAUDREY\nYoung man, kindly moderate your tone when you address my fiance.\n\nPAUL\nI'm sorry, Missus, but the betrothal's off.\n(He grabs GRANDFATHER by the arm.)\nI'll refuse me consent, he's over-age!\n\nAUDREY grabs GRANDFATHER's other arm and pulls back.\n\nAUDREY\nLeave him alone, after all he's done for you is this the way you repay him?\n\nA tug of war now starts between PAUL and AUDREY.\n\nPAUL\n(pulling)\nHim? he's never done anything for anybody in his life.\n\nAUDREY\n(pulling)\nYou dare to say that when even those ridiculous clothes you are wearing were bought when you forced him to sell out his gilt edged Indomitables!!\n\nJOHN and GEORGE jump on the seat egging PAUL and AUDREY on.\n\nJOHN\nCome on, Auntie, you're winning.\n\nGEORGE\nGet in there, Paul, she's weakening.\n\nRINGO attempts to interfere.\n\nRINGO\nLook, Missus, this is all a misunderstanding, you see, he's ...\n\nAUDREY\nKeep away from me, you depraved lout, I know all about your terrible past.\n\nRINGO\nY'what?\n\nShe hits RINGO with her handbag and continues struggling with PAUL for GRANDFATHER. RINGO grabs her handbag to stop her hitting him.\n\nRINGO\nHe's given me a bad character, blackguarding me name to all and sundry. He's got to be stopped. It's not fair.\n\nRINGO pushes out into the corridor, forgetting that he is holding the woman's handbag.\n\nA voice shouts off from outside.\n\nVOICE OFF\nThat's one of them ... stop thief!\n\n14.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR\n\nFrom Ringo's P.O.V. we see down to the right the city man, JOHNSON, approaching with a GUARD. RINGO turns the other way to the left when he is joined by [the] three other boys. From their P.O.V. down the corridor we see the two girls, autograph books in hand, followed by ten girls from the same school.\n\nBoth groups are closing in on the BOYS. There's no escape.\n\nRINGO\n(looking down at the handbag in his hand)\nOh Mother!!\n\n15.\tINTERIOR  LUGGAGE VAN\n\nVery dark, and behind bars we see GRANDFATHER. He is sitting crouched up on a wooden box tea chest and looks pretty miserable. He turns towards the CAMERA; in the foreground of the SHOT we see PAUL standing.\nIn the background an impassive GUARD is reading a paper which he does throughout the scene.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(bitterly)\nAnd to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!\n\nPAUL\nDon't dramatise.\n\nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see GRANDFATHER in the luggage compartment of the guards' van. In with him are a crate of chickens and a dog. The chickens peck at him; GRANDFATHER moves listlessly away.\n\nPAUL\nLet's face it, you're lucky to be here. If they'd have had their way you'd have been dropped off at Stafford already.\n\nGRANDFATHER proudly turns away from PAUL who dodges round so he can still see his face.\n\nPAUL\nWell, you've got to admit you've upset a lot of people. At least I can keep my eye on you while you're stuck in here.\n\nGRANDFATHER turns away again.\n\nPAUL\nAll right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...\n\nGRANDFATHER\nA harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.\n\nPAUL\nOh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(cutting in)\nYou're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?\n\nPAUL\nYeah ... so what?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWhy do you always use your left hand?\n\nPAUL\nWell, don't be daft, I've got to.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.\n\nPAUL grins. After a moment of looking at him, PAUL opens the door of\nthe luggage compartment and joins GRANDFATHER on a box.\n\nPAUL\nShove up!\n\nGRANDFATHER produces a penny.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nOdds or evens?\n\nPAUL sighs.\n\nPAUL\nOdds.\n\nGRANDFATHER flips the coin.\n\nThe guards' van door opens and JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO come in, with them are the girls, RITA and JEAN.\n\nJOHN\n(as he sees PAUL behind the bars)\nDon't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.\n\nPAUL\nOh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.\n(to Ringo)\nAnyroad up ... It's all your fault.\n\nRINGO\nMe? Why?\n\nGEORGE\nBag-snatcher.\nGRANDFATHER\nThat's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.\n\nJOHN\n(casually)\nEvery morning.\n\nJOHN has been looking around the guards' van.\n\nJOHN\nGaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...\n(he pats the dog)\n'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.\n(he shudders)\nCome on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.\n\nPAUL\nLike what?\n\nJOHN\nWell, I've got me gob stopper.\n(he produces his mouth organ.)\nLook, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.\n\nAnd to RINGO's beat on a tea chest they are off, PAUL and GEORGE improvising other sounds, much to the GIRLS' delight. During the number, GRANDFATHER quietly lets the latch off the chicken crate and chickens begin to wander through the scene.\n\n16.\tEXTERIOR  TRAIN IN MOTION FROM ABOVE (NIGHT)\n\nWhile the number is progressing, the train is getting nearer and nearer to London.\n\n17.\tEXTERIOR  PLATFORM TERMINUS (NIGHT)\n\nSHOTS of the station full of GIRLS waiting for the BOYS.\n\n18.\tINTERIOR  GUARDS VAN\n\nBy the time the number finishes the train pulls up with a sharp halt that sends them all sprawling, BOYS and GIRLS.\n\nNORM enters the guards' van.\n\nNORM\nDon't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.\n\nJOHN\nPlease, can I have one to surge with?\n\nNORM\nNo.\n\nJOHN\nAh, go on, you swine.\n\nNORM\nNo, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.\n\nHe points and we see a big car parked across the road.\n\nThe BOYS prepare to depart, lining up with GRANDFATHER at the door.\n\n19.\tEXTERIOR  PLATFORM TERMINUS\n\nJust as they are ready to go, a line of taxis draws up parallel to the train and now separates them from the big car waiting for them.\n\nNORM\nOh no!\n\nGRANDFATHER pushes past the BOYS, holding his coat closed.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAll right, lads, follow me.\n\nAnd before NORM can stop him, he darts out of the door, PAUL after him. The fans further down the platform see PAUL and charge forward ... in a panic NORM and the others follow, JOHN just having time to kiss both the girls.\n\nJOHN\nVive l'amour!\n\nNORM drags him away.\n\n20.\tEXTERIOR  RAILWAY STATION\n\nThe BOYS manage to follow GRANDFATHER by leaping onto a motorized luggage carrier, GEORGE driving and the other three posing as a frozen tableau on the back. GRANDFATHER has arrived at a taxi door. He flings it open and runs through, opening the other door, thus making a safe bridge to the car.\n\nThe BOYS follow and manage to make it to the big car safely. They run towards grandfather's taxi. The FANS have followed the BOYS and we see streams of GIRLS piling through all the taxis one of which contains JOHNSON the city man, opening and shutting the doors to get through, much to the indignation of the TAXI DRIVERS.\n21.\tINTERIOR  BIG CAR\n\nNORM is sitting in front with the driver, FRANK. The four BOYS and GRANDFATHER are squashed together in the back.\n\nNORM\n(to the driver)\nGo like the clappers, son!\n\nFRANK\n(smoothly)\nThat was my entire intention, sir.\n\n22.\tEXTERIOR  STATION\n\nThe car moves off surrounded by the FANS; from a height we see them converge on the car but it moves forcefully out of the station and off.\n\nIt moves into the traffic in the main road and the journey to the hotel begins.\n\n23.\tINTERIOR  HOTEL SUITE  NIGHT\n\nThere is a reception room and off it lead rooms that are presumably bedrooms, bathroom, etc. JOHN is lying sprawled out on a settee listening to a transistor radio, demolishing a basket of fruit. PAUL is sitting at an upright piano and GRANDFATHER is mooching about the room. One of the doors opens and GEORGE enters followed by RINGO, none of the BOYS are wearing coats.\n\nRINGO\nI don't snore.\n\nGEORGE\nYou do - repeatedly.\n\nRINGO\n(to John)\nDo I snore?\n\nJOHN\n(eating a banana)\nYou're a window rattler, son.\n\nRINGO\nWell, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?\n\nPAUL\n(stopping playing)\nWith a trombone hooter like yours it'd be unnatural if you didn't.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nDon't mock the afflicted, Pauly.\n\nPAUL\nOh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWell, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.\n\nNORM enters with three piles of fan mail and places them in front of JOHN on a table. RINGO is almost in tears, examining his nose in a mirror.\n\nNORM\nPaul, John, George - get at it.\n\nJOHN\nHello the income tax have caught up with us at last.\n\nPAUL and GEORGE gather round the low table. RINGO is left out of it.\n\nRINGO\nNone for me, then?\n\nNORM\nSorry.\n\nJohn hands RINGO a single envelope.\n\nJOHN\nThat'll keep you busy.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nIt's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...\n\nRINGO\nYou go and pick on your own.\n\nSHAKE enters with a stack of mail about three times larger than all the others put together.\n\nJOHN\nIs that yours?\n\nSHAKE\nFor Ringo.\n\nHe dumps it in Ringo's arms who staggers into an armchair. The BOYS send him up.\n\nJOHN\nThat must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.\n\nGEORGE\nHe comes from a large family.\n\nRINGO\n(dumping the letters)\nWell.\n\nRINGO opens his letter and reads it. It contains a large embossed card.\n\nRINGO\nEh, what's Boyd's Club?\n\nThe lads gather round him and PAUL takes the card from him and reads.\n\nPAUL\n\"The Management of Boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr Richard Starkey\"--that's you--\"in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet.\" Blimey!\n\nRINGO\n(surprised)\nAnd they want me?\n\nJOHN\nOh, it's got round that you're a heavy punter.\n\nNORM\n(snatching the card)\nWell you're not going.\n\nRINGO\nAh.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(taking card from Norm)\nQuite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!\n\nHe pockets the card himself.\n\nRINGO\nThat's mine.\n\nNORM\nHave done, and you lot get your pens out.\n\nBOYS\nWhy?\n\nNORM\nIt's homework time for all you college puddings. I want this lot\n(he indicates the fan letters)\nall answered tonight.\n\nThe BOYS all protest.\n\nNORM\nI'll brook no denial!\n\nJOHN\nIt's all right for you, you couldn't get a pen in your foot, you swine.\n\nNORM\nCome on, Shake, we'll leave 'em to their\npenmanship.\n\nHe goes followed by SHAKE.\n\nThere is a pause and JOHN deliberately rises slowly and crosses to his coat. He puts it on and walks to the door.\n\nJOHN\nWhile the swine's away the piglets can play. Well, come on, what are we waiting for?\n\nWith a whoop PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO collect their coats and head for the door.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWhat about all these letters?\n\nBOYS\nRead 'em!\n\nThey disappear. After a moment GRANDFATHER takes out Ringo's card.\n\nC.U. GRANDFATHER\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd a free champagne buffet.\n\nHe grins to himself. At this moment a WAITER enters with a tray. He is clad in tails and GRANDFATHER eyes them longingly, measuring himself the while alongside the startled waiter. He leaves us with no doubt in our minds what he wants, i.e., the waiter's suit.\n\n\n24.\tINTERIOR  DANCING CLUB  NIGHT\n\nThe club is the latest in modern decor and full of teenagers all enjoying themselves. The CAMERA wanders around the club till it finally picks out JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO all crowded around one small table. The music is blaring away from a juke box and the BOYS join the dancers. They are recognised and given smiles and nods of encouragement\nby all the other customers. During this scene we\n\nCUT AWAY\n\n25.\tINTERIOR  BOYD'S CLUB  NIGHT\n\nThe whole atmosphere is of quiet elegance and loud wealth. Around the baccarat table the rich, bored customers sit barely moving a face muscle as they languidly murmur \"suivez\" and \"banco\" to the dealer as he operates the shoe. The manager of the club is beaming with satisfaction as he surveys his customers. One of these customers is clad in evening dress and he has his back to us. The rest of the players (male) are in suits. By each of them is standing a lush lady with a bored sophisticated face that looks as if it has been painted on. From the REVERSE of the LAST SHOT we now see the solitary evening dress player is GRANDFATHER. He looks around him and wipes off his look of enjoyment and elaborately out-bores everyone in the room.\n\nDEALER\nAlors, M'sieur?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(nonchalant)\nSoufl\u00e9e.\n\nHe turns to the buxom BLONDE, who is dripping over him.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI bet you're a great swimmer. My turn? Bingo!\n\nCROUPIER\nPas \"Bingo,\" M'sieur... Banco.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(taking)\nI'll take the little darlings anyway.\n\nHe takes up the cards and can't understand that they are unnumbered.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nTwo and one is three, carry one is four.\n\nThe buxom BLONDE leans over him.\n\nBLONDE\nLay them down.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(disturbed by his eyeline)\nEh?\n\nBLONDE\nLay them down.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWe'd be thrown out.\n\nBLONDE\nYour cards... lay them down... face up.\n\nHe does so.\n\nCROUPIER\nHuit \u00e0 la pointe... et sept.\n(He pushes chips and box to Grandfather.)\n\nBLONDE\nYou had a lovely little pair, y'see.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI did?\n\nCROUPIER taps impatiently on box (shoe).\n\nBLONDE\nThey're yours.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThey are?\n\nBLONDE\nThe cards... you're bank.\n\n26.\tINTERIOR  DANCING CLUB\n\nThe BOYS are having a rare old time and the place is really moving.\n\n27.\tINTERIOR  BOYD'S CLUB\n\nGRANDFATHER is playing and a waiter is checking the requirements of the players.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nBingo!\n\nCROUPIER\n(wearily)\nM'lord dit \"Bingo.\"\n\nWAITER\n(to Grandfather)\nA little light refreshment.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(lordly)\nA glass of the old chablis to wash down a gesture of giblets wouldn't go amiss.\n(He resumes his game.)\nSoufl\u00e9e, chop chop.\n\nThe CROUPIER uses the spatula to pick up a card. GRANDFATHER grabs it and scoops some sandwiches off a passing tray.\n28.\tINTERIOR  DANCING CLUB\n\nThe BOYS are at their table again laughing and enjoying themselves, when suddenly their faces freeze.\n\nFrom their P.O.V. we see NORM standing glowering down at them. With him is SHAKE. Reluctantly the BOYS arise and follow NORM out.\n\n29.\tINTERIOR  BOYD'S\n\nGRANDFATHER is looking worried at the call of the card he loses and we see that all his chips have gone. He notices the waiter delivering snacks and champagne to a couple, so quick as a flash, he places a handkerchief over his arm and writing a bill out on a piece of paper, presents it to the couple and collects payment in chips. He then resumes playing.\n\n30.\tINTERIOR  HOTEL ROOM\n\nWaiter is sitting on chair in underclothes, reading. He hears a noise, says \"The manager!\" and hides in outer clothes closet. NORM and the BOYS enter saying:\n\nNORM\nNow get on with it.\n\nJOHN\nWe were going to do it.\n\nNORM\nAye, well, now!\n(He goes through bedroom.)\n\nRINGO goes to hang up coat in closet. He does so, then crosses to rest.\n\nRINGO\nAny of you lot put a man in that cupboard?\n\nALL\nA man? No.\n\nRINGO\nWell somebody did.\n\nGEORGE goes to cupboard. We see the WAITER from his P.O.V. He closes door, returns to group.\n\nGEORGE\nHe's right, y'know.\n\nBOYS\n(disinterested)\nAh well, there you go.\n\nSHAKE enters front door, goes to hang up coat and drags WAITER out.\n\nSHAKE\nEh, what's all this?\n\nPAUL\nOh, him... He's been lurking.\n\nJOHN\nAye, he looks a right lurker.\n\nSHAKE\n(to WAITER)\nYou're undressed. Where are your clothes?\n\nWAITER\nThe old gentlemen borrowed them to go gambling at Boyd's.\n\nPAUL\nNo!\n\nRINGO\nOh, he's gone to my club, has he?\n\nPAUL\n(turning on Ringo)\nYeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.\n\nJOHN\nWell, what are we waiting for?\n\nSHAKE\nAye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours\nis worse than any of you lot.\n\n31.\tINTERIOR  BOYD'S\n\nGRANDFATHER is drinking champagne in locked arms with BLONDE.\n\nWAITER\nEncore de champagne, Monsieur?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYes, and I'll have some more champagne as well.\n\nHe takes another swig of his glass.\n\nMANAGER\n(beaming)\nLord John McCartney, he's the millionaire Irish Peer, filthy rich of course.\n\nCUSTOMER\nOh I don't know, looks rather clean to me.\n\nThe MANAGER comes to grandfather's side.\n\nMANAGER\nPlay is about to resume, m'lord.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(handing him a chip)\nLead me to it, I've a winning itch that only success can pacify.\n\nHe takes his place at the table. The MANAGER watches for a moment then moves away from the table towards the club reception desk.\n\n32.\tINTERIOR  RECEPTION DESK  BOYD'S CLUB\n\nJOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, NORM and SHAKE are trying to gain entrance.\n\nATTENDANT\nI'm sorry sir, members and invited guests only.\n\nPAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, JOHN\nI've got to get in.\nIt's urgent and important.\nI've had an invite.\nTake me to your leader.\n\nNORM\nShurrup.\n\nThe BOYS do and meanwhile the MANAGER has walked into SHOT. He recognises the BOYS and welcomes them with false enthusiasm. They all start to enter the main room.\n\nNORM\nAll we want to know is have you got a little\nold man in there?\n\nMANAGER\n(pleasantly)\nDo you mean Lord McCartney?\n\nCLOSE-UP PAUL\n\nPAUL\nHe's at it again. Look, I'm his grandfather... I mean...\n\nBLONDE\n(standing next to Grandfather)\nOh, it must be the dolly floor show.\n\nJOHN\nStay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWho are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... (etc.)\n\nThey grab the protesting GRANDFATHER and drag him into the reception area. He keeps trying to return to BLONDE and table. GEORGE and RINGO each take an end of the velvet cord hanging between the two stanchions. They exchange ends and re-hook it, thus encircling GRANDFATHER by the\nentrance desk. They then go to settle up.\n\nMANAGER\n(with false charm)\nBefore you go, gentlemen, there's the small matter of the bill.\n\nHe snaps his fingers and a waiter hands him the bill.\n\nNORM\n(taking it)\nI'll settle that.\n\nHe glances at it.\n\nNORM\nA hundred and eighty pounds!\n\nMANAGER\n(icily)\nI beg your pardon, guineas.\n\nAt that moment a WAITER appears with a tray full of pound notes.\n\nWAITER\nYour winnings, my lord, one hundred and ninety\npounds.\n\nThe MANAGER tears up the bill and takes the money.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHow about me change?\n\nMANAGER\nCloak room charge.\n\nHe hands GRANDFATHER his old mackintosh.\n\nRINGO\n(brightly)\nAh well, easy come, easy go.\n\nThe others glower at him.\n\nRINGO\nWell.\n\n33.\tINTERIOR  BIG CAR (MOVING ON WAY TO STUDIOS)\n\nThe BOYS have settled down.\n\nJOHN\nShould I say it?\n\nGEORGE\nFollow your impulse.\n\nRINGO\nIt'll only get you into trouble.\n\nJOHN\n(to RINGO)\nAah, shurrup, misery!\n\nJOHN slouches forward.\n\nJOHN\n(urgently)\nO.K. Driver, follow that car!!\n\nThe driver [Frank] is an urbane young man in a handsome grey uniform.\n\nFRANK\n(indicating the traffic)\nWould you like to be a little more precise, sir?\n\nJOHN\nWell, that's the wrong line for a start.\n\nFRANK\nSorry?\n(meaning: \"I beg your pardon.\")\n\nGEORGE\nOh, don't pay any attention to him, he was just fulfilling a lifelong ambition.\n\nFRANK\nI see.\n\nJOHN\nYeah, you know, \"O.K. Buster, follow that car, there's a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!\"\n\nFRANK\nOh, yes, now I'm with you.\n[he changes his accent]\nBut, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...\n\nThe car is stopped in traffic behind a bus. JOHN gets out of car and walks to the front. JOHN leans in window delightedly, he flashes his wallet.\n\nJOHN\nEver seen one of these before?\n\nFRANK\nAh ... a shamus, eh?\n\nJOHN\nI see you go to the night court.\n\nFRANK\nI've made the scene.\n\nJOHN\nWell, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.\n\nGEORGE\nI don't think that bit's right.\n\nJOHN\nWhat do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?\n\n\n34.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nAs the big car overtakes a Company Director's Rolls. JOHN lowers his window and the boys let out an imaginary hail of bullets at the Executive in the back. He reacts violently and starts to shout at them. As he does so, he presses the button of his window, so that we hear only part of it. But what we do is unpleasant. He immediately presses the button and the window rises.\n\nRINGO and PAUL jump out of the car. RINGO takes two drumsticks from his coat pocket and, using them as banderillas, inserts them with style into the radiator grill (V.O. \"Ole\" from the BOYS). PAUL, then, using his coat as a matador's cloak, does a butterfly pass at the car which\nhas just started up, narrowly missing him, but he keeps in the matador position.\n\n35.\tINTERIOR  CAR\n\nNORM\nWill you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.\n\nJOHN\n(as Ringo and Paul climb in)\nWell, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.\n\nFRANK\n(to Norm)\nWe're nearly there, sir.\n\nJOHN\nEh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.\n\nCLOSE SHOT of a long suffering NORM.\n\nNORM\nAnd I was happy in the bakery. I'll never know\nwhy I left.\n\n36.\tEXTERIOR OF AN OLD VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL THEATRE\n\nWhich has been converted to the T.V. studios.\n\nThere are a few groups of GIRL FANS standing outside the front of the theatre, but against the kerb of the pavement is a night-watchman's canvas hut and brazier.\n\nThe car approaches.\n\n37.\tINTERIOR OF THE CAR\n\nNORM\nGet ready John, open the door and as it draws up, out you go and straight in.\n\nJOHN nods and opens the door. The FANS start to swarm 'round them. To escape, the BOYS dash into the night-watchman's canvas hut, pick it up and run with it to the stage door, revealing the night watchman, staring in astonishment.\n\nAt the door the BOYS put the hut down and enter the theatre.\n\n38.\tINTERIOR  STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE\n\nAs the BOYS enter, two P.R.O. men in dark suits, stiff white collars\nand old school ties step forward and smile menacingly.\n\nFIRST P.R.O. MAN\n(menacingly)\nPress conference, they're waiting for you.\n\nNORM\n(jovially)\nGive us a couple of shakes to get our breath.\n\nFIRST P.R.O. MAN\n(more menacingly)\nThey're waiting now!\n\nAnd without more ado they grab an arm each and march the protesting NORM towards the stairs that lead to the dress circle.\n\nPAUL\nEh this lot means it. They're even taking\nhostages.\n\nThe BOYS, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER rush after the rapidly disappearing NORM, who by now is half way up the stairs.\n\n39.\tINTERIOR OF DRESS CIRCLE LOUNGE BALLROOM\n\nIt is empty except for two barmaids poised ready to serve, standing behind trestle tables full of drinks and sandwiches. The dark suited MEN enter with NORM and close behind them follow GRANDFATHER, SHAKE and the boys. The group arrives at the centre of the lounge and have time to look about and see the food but before they can get to it, from all directions NEWSPAPERMEN and PHOTOGRAPHERS converge upon them..\n\nNow begins an elaborate tug-of-war between various PHOTOGRAPHERS using their flash attachments and REPORTERS to capture a Beatle and in the midst of this running battle a man with a portable recorder is trying to interview them. Together and singly the BOYS are pushed about the room and while this goes on a hard core of NEWSPAPERMEN are busily devouring sandwiches and pouring themselves drinks, to the annoyance of the BARMAIDS.\n\nEvery time one of the BOYS attempts to get a sandwich or a drink, it is either too late, the plate is empty, or they are intercepted. The single and constant thing we see in the scene is the pushing and pulling, heavy impersonal handling, the boys are just things to be placed like still life in one advantageous position after another. During the scene these individual exchanges take place:\n\nSOUND REPORTER\nWhat's your philosophy of life?\n\nJOHN\nI'm torn between Zen and I'm all right, Jack.\n\nREPORTER\nHas success changed your life?\n\nRINGO\nYes.\n\nREPORTER\nDo you like playing the guitar?\n\nGEORGE\nNext to kissing girls it's favourites.\n\nPAUL is surrounded by newspapermen.\n\nPAUL\nNo, actually, we're just good friends.\n\nHIGH SHOT of the press reception and we see the BOYS ease their way out until they get to the curtained entrance to the dress circle; completely unnoticed, they slip through.\n\n40.\tINTERIOR  THEATRE DRESS CIRCLE\n\nThe BOYS come up the stairs into the Dress Circle proper. GRANDFATHER and SHAKE are sitting there having a picnic of beer and sandwiches.\n\nPAUL\n(ironically)\nAnything to spare?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWe've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.\n\nGEORGE\nSure.\n(He does so).\n\nPAUL\nAh well. Eh, look!\n\nHe points, and from PAUL'S P.O.V. we see on stage, the setting up of the show, scenery and lights, cameras and sound equipment are being put into position by a small army of studio staff. DANCERS and SINGERS are milling about as well.\n\nPAUL\nLet's go and muck in.\n\nJOHN\nAye, before anyone stops us.\n\nThey exit to rows of the dress circle and go through the entrance down the narrow stairs to the stalls and on to the stage that is built and extended right into the stalls, which are partly covered up.\n\n41.\tINTERIOR  STAGE\n\nEveryone is so busy that they hardly notice the BOYS, who wander about and examine the studio equipment. A load of three drum sets are being brought on stage and a voice shouts out:\n\nVOICE\nHere, what about these electric guitars?\n\nSHAKE\nWhere are they?\n\nVOICE\nBack here, mate.\n\nSHAKE\n(going towards the voice)\nI'm coming.\n\nRINGO is busy setting up his drums, and men are setting up the other sets. He drops a stick and the FLOOR MANAGER retrieves it and is about to tap the drum. The FLOOR MANAGER is a languid young man.\n\nRINGO\nLeave them drums alone.\n\nFLOOR MANAGER\nOh, surely one can have a tiny touch.\n\nRINGO\nIf you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm\nout on strike.\n\nFLOOR MANAGER\nAren't you being rather arbitrary?\n\nRINGO\nThat's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?\n\nFLOOR MANAGER\nSpoil sport!\n\nRINGO\nWell!\n\nRINGO fusses like a mother hen clucking over his drums. The FLOOR MANAGER is furious.\n\nGEORGE\nHe's very touchy about those his drums, they loom large in his legend.\n\nRINGO gives his drums a defiant crash and JOHN and PAUL stop whatever they are up to and hurry over.\n\nPAUL\nWhat's up?\n\nGEORGE\n(pointing)\nHe's sulking again.\n\nJOHN\nI'll show him.\n\nHe picks up a set of drum sticks and bashes back at RINGO, who does a more complicated drum roll. GEORGE now joins in and to PAUL'S encouragement a drum duel starts completely naturally and improvised. During this encounter the work proceeds around them and the guitars are brought on and SHAKE sets them to working order. PAUL first, then JOHN and GEORGE take up their own instruments and out of the drum duel emerges one of their numbers.\n\n42.\tINTERIOR  RAMP\n\nAs the number finishes a baldheaded man (he is the T.V. director) storms down the ramp that leads from the control box under the dress circle.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(with over-exaggerated calm)\nAll right I'm sorry and let's hear no more about it. If that's your opinion, you're probably right. Look, if you think I'm unsuitable let's have it out in the open, I can't stand these back-stage politics.\n\nBy the end of this speech he is standing in front of JOHN who takes the scene in his stride.\n\nJOHN\nAren't you tending to black and white this whole situation?\n\nDIRECTOR\nWell, quite honestly I wasn't expecting \"a musical arranger\" who would question my ability ... picture-wise.\n\nJOHN\n(to the others)\nI could listen to him for hours.\n\nPAUL\nHeave to, what's all this about a musical arranger?\n\nDIRECTOR\nMr. McCartney Senior!\n\nThe BOYS have a giggle at the very idea and at this moment GRANDFATHER appears from behind the DIRECTOR.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHey Pauly, they're trying to fob you off wid this musical charlatan but I've given him the test.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(bravely)\nI'm quite happy to be replaced.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(indicating the director)\nHe's a typical buck-passer.\n\nDIRECTOR\nI won an award.\n\nJOHN\nA likely story.\n\nDIRECTOR\nIt's on the wall in my office.\n\nAt this moment NORM comes on the stage, confident, cigar in mouth and serene.\n\nNORM\nHello our lot, everyone happy?\n\nThe BOYS, the DIRECTOR, FLOOR MANAGER and GRANDFATHER turn on him and stare silently.\n\nNORM\nAll right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.\n\nDIRECTOR\nPlease do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.\n\nHe glares at GRANDFATHER who glares right back. The DIRECTOR walks away with the FLOOR MANAGER pacifying him.\n\nDIRECTOR\nGive me a bottle of milk and a packet of\nOblivion. Oh, it's a plot, I see it now, it's\nall a plot.\n\nThey go left towards the back-stage.\n\nNORM\n(producing key)\nNow, come on, I've got the key.\n\nHe leads the lads off right. RINGO is last as he is putting his drum sticks down safely.\n\nNORM and the BOYS turn on him.\n\nNORM\nLet's have you.\n\nJOHN\nCome on speedy!\n\nPAUL\nRingo!\n\nGEORGE\nWake up!\n\nRINGO glares at them and follows quickly. As the BOYS move off after NORM, they pass the next act waiting for rehearsal. It is an elegant man in full-tail suit meticulously adjusting his cuff-links. Beside him is a free-standing sign reading \"Leslie Jackson and his ten disappearing doves.\" The BOYS pass him and go through the door. GRANDFATHER stops and looks at the performer with respect.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI can't tell you how much I've enjoyed your act.\n\nHe slaps the man on the back with happy camaraderie. There is the sound of a dove, a few feathers fall out of the sleeve of the man's coat and he and GRANDFATHER look down at the floor. The man glares at GRANDFATHER, takes out a pen from his pocket, crosses out \"10\" on his sign, and writes \"9\" in its place, puts the pen back in his pocket and starts towards the centre stage putting on a false performer's smile as he does.\n\n43.\tINTERIOR  THEATRE  BACK-STAGE CORRIDOR\n\nThe BOYS move down the narrow stairs, and out of the ground floor dressing rooms stream a steady flow of costumed actors and actresses. They engulf the lads and force them against the wall -- the actors are all making for the stage door. As the actors push past the boys we see the boys' excited faces, their mouths watering for the costumes. JOHN touches the costume on one actor.\n\nJOHN\n(to actor)\nGear costume!\n\nACTOR\n(eyeing him)\nSwap?\n\nNORM\nRight, first floor and no messing about.\n\nNORM, leading the way, goes up the stairs but as they turn the first corner they are confronted by a group of girls, a game of manners starts, \"after you,\" \"No, after you.\" NORM who is ahead of the group looks down on them in disgust.\n\nNORM\nLennon, leave them girls alone or I'll report you.\n\nThe BOYS let the GIRLS pass and resume the journey, always surrounded by people.\n\n44.\tINTERIOR  DRESSING ROOM AND CORRIDOR\n\nRINGO'S attention is caught by a door. He crosses and opens it, looking out to a fire escape. The others join him and the four boys step through the door and onto the fire escape.\n\n45.\tEXTERIOR  TOP OF FIRE ESCAPE\n\nFrom the BOYS' P.O.V. we see down below into the property yard behind nthe theatre. It is a long narrow yard full of old coaches, motor cars and all the general debris of hundreds of sets from past theatre shows. Through the piles of heaped high junk there are a couple of narrow alleyways.\n\nThe BOYS scamper down the fire escape.\n\nWhen they reach the bottom of the alleyways, there is a large door. They open it and look through.\n\nFrom their P.O.V. we see a large green field quite empty. The boys step through the doorway into the field. We now see from a HELICOPTER SHOT the four BOYS standing together surrounded by space.\n\nIt is the first time they have been alone and unconfined all day.\n\nThey look at each other and grin ... then first GEORGE and PAUL let out a whoop and run towards the centre of the field, after a moment JOHN and RINGO follow them. The BOYS pick up some loose straw and insert it under JOHN'S cap and sleeves, turning him into a scarecrow.\n\nThe four BOYS dash about madly calling out to one another and generally horsing around. Out of this emerges an imaginary game of soccer and although there is no ball the game is fast and furious. After a few moments the long shadow of a man falls across the grass.\n\nMAN'S VOICE\n(off)\nI suppose you know this is private property.\n\nThe boys freeze.\n\nFrom their P.O.V. we see a big burly middle-aged man glowering at them. The boys exchange rueful glances and, under the big man's eye, mooch back towards the gateway they came in by. JOHN is the last to go through. He turns to the man.\n\nJOHN\nSorry if we hurt your field, Mister.\n46.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR  BACK-STAGE\n\nGRANDFATHER is sneaking down the corridor, a pile of photos under his arm.\n\n47.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  UNDERNEATH THE STAGE\n\nUnder the stage the usual set of wooden columns that support the stage with lots of furniture and a single light is on; it is placed by the orchestra's entrance to the orchestra pit. GRANDFATHER comes down the stairs and winds his way through the columns until he finds himself a safe little cubby hole and settles himself under the light. He spreads the signed photos of the BOYS in front of him and, adjusting an old- fashioned pair of glasses, ball-point pen in hand begins to copy the BOYS' signatures on to the fresh photos, tutting at his failures and chuckling at his successes. After a moment, there is a sound of someone coming down the stairs. GRANDFATHER darts into a dark patch out of sight.\n\nThe menacing shadows appear on the stairway.\n\nNORM (voice off)\nThere's no one here.\n\nSHAKE (voice off)\nThis is the only way they could have gone.\n\nWe now see GRANDFATHER holding himself stiffly in, he is on some sort of raised platform and he fidgets and in doing so he knocks a lever of some sort. Slowly GRANDFATHER ascends out of shot with a light that grows bigger above him.\n\n48.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE STAGE\n\nA rehearsal of the toast scene from a Strauss Operetta. The entire stage is full of SINGERS, glasses in hand they are singing away at each other but in true opera tradition they are addressing out to the audience. Slowly in-between the leading man and leading woman, who are about to embrace, a stage trap opens and a blinking, surprised, GRANDFATHER appears. Here we INTERCUT to the T.V. Control Room for amazed reaction shots of the DIRECTOR and control room CREW.\n\nBack now on the stage the toast song reaches its climax and the leading man and woman rush into each other's arms, GRANDFATHER sandwiched between them.\n\n\n48A.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR AS BOYS PASS THRU ON WAY TO DRESSING ROOM\n\nJOHN is behind them. JOHN, BOYS and MILLIE are walking towards each other.\n\nMILLIE\n(as all pass)\nHello.\n\nJOHN\n(stopping... the boys carry on past, not noticing her)\nHello.\n\nMILLIE\nOh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...\n\nJOHN\nNo, not me.\n\nMILLIE\n(insistently)\nOh you are, I know you are.\n\nJOHN\nNo, I'm not.\n\nMILLIE\nYou are.\n\nJOHN\nI'm not, no.\n\nMILLIE\nWell, you look like him.\n\nJOHN\nOh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.\n\nMILLIE\nOh you do, look.\n\nJOHN looks at himself in the mirror.\n\nJOHN examines himself in the mirror carefully.\n\nJOHN\nMy eyes are lighter.\n\nMILLIE\n(agreeing)\nOh yes.\n\nJOHN\nAnd my nose...\n\nMILLIE\nWell, yes your nose is. Very.\n\nJOHN\nIs it?\n\nMILLIE\nI would have said so.\n\nJOHN\nAye, but you know him well.\n\nMILLIE\n(indignantly)\nNo I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.\n\nJOHN\n(knowingly)\nThat's what you tell me.\n\nMILLIE\n(suspiciously)\nWhat have you heard?\n\nJOHN\n(blandly)\nIt's all over the place, everyone knows.\n\nMILLIE\nIs it? Is it really?\n\nJOHN\nMind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.\n\nMILLIE\nI knew I could rely on you.\n\nJOHN\n(modestly)\nThanks.\n\nMILLIE touches his arm then walks away. After a moment she turns.\n\nMILLIE\nYou don't look like him at all.\n\nJOHN winks at her and she winks back.\n49.\tINTERIOR  DRESSING ROOM\n\nNORM and SHAKE enter the room. The BOYS' TAILOR is there waiting for the BOYS.\n\nSHAKE\nOh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.\n\nNORM\nThat's too easy for Lennon.\n\nHe crosses to door leading to fire escape.\n\nNORM\n(dramatically)\nHe's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.\n\nSHAKE\nYou're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.\n\nNORM\nOh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.\n\nSHAKE\nBut John hasn't got any.\n\nNORM\nWhat?\n\nSHAKE\nNerves.\n\nNORM\nI know, that's the trouble.\n\nHe puffs nervously at his cigarette.\n\nNORM\nOh, I've toyed with the idea of a ball and chain but he'd only rattle them at me... and in public and all. Sometimes I think he enjoys seeing me suffer.\n\nHe hears something.\n\nNORM\nGet behind that door, they're coming. Someone's coming. Quick, hide!\n\nThe two men hide behind the door. The boys enter the room, as JOHN is last he shuts the door and faces SHAKE and NORM.\n\nJOHN\nWhat are you doing there?\n\nSHAKE\nHiding.\n\nJOHN\nI think you're soft or something.\n\nNORM\nWe weren't hiding.\n\nTAILOR\nNow?\n\nNORM\nNow. We were trying to catch you redhanded. I thought I told you lot to stay here?\n\nRINGO\nWell ...\n\nNORM\nWhen I tell you to stay put, stay put.\n\nJOHN\n(down on his knees)\nDon't cane me, sir, I was led astray.\n\nNORM\nOh shurrup and come on John. They're waiting\nfor you in the studio.\n\nRINGO\nOh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.\n\nNORM\nGood lad, Ringo.\n\nPAUL\nOh, listen to teacher's pet.\n\nGEORGE\nYou crawler.\n\nJOHN\nHe's betrayed the class.\n\nRINGO\nOh, leave off!!!\n\nJOHN\nTemper! Temper!\n\nRINGO\nWell ...\n\nCLOSE-UP on NORM's long suffering face.\n\nNORM\nWill you all get a move on! They're waiting for\nyou!\n\nBy this time the TAILOR has his tape stretched between his hands to measure GEORGE's shoulders. But since GEORGE has moved away, he is measuring space. JOHN takes up his scissors and cuts the tape.\nJOHN\nI now declare this bridge open.\n\nThe BOYS run out the door.\n\n50.\tINTERIOR  BACKSTAGE AREA\n\nFive beautiful MODELS are standing about in costume. One is knitting a loose wool sweater which is almost completed. There is the sound of a juggling act's music off and a few of the girls are looking off towards the centre stage. At the edge of frame is a collapsible table covered with green baize. On it are three spaced white plates.\n\nFrom the door off stage, above which is a sign \"To Canteen and Production Offices\", GRANDFATHER enters eating a plate of spaghetti on toast. The knitting GIRL sees him and, in mime, asks him to stand still so that she can measure the sweater against him. GRANDFATHER, eager to help, puts his plate of food on the green table between plates two and\nthree. He goes to be measured with the sweater.\n\nFrom the onstage area, a juggler's ASSISTANT (pretty girl) in costume backs up and with the usual theatrical flourishes picks up, without looking, plate number ONE and throws it off screen towards centre stage. There is a drum roll from orchestra. She then throws plate number TWO. We CUT on stage to the JUGGLER now balancing the two spinning plates on two poles, one in each hand. He has another pole in his mouth and nods to his ASSISTANT, asking for the THIRD plate.\n\nWe CUT BACK to the ASSISTANT who, still not looking, throws plate THREE which is GRANDFATHER's. There is the sound of an orchestra raggedly stopping and all the hangers-on in the scene look off interestedly.\n\nWe hear the DIRECTOR's voice.\n\nDIRECTOR (V.O.)\nAll right, hold it, hold it... O.K. John, wipe him down and we'll carry on with the next act.\n\nWe\n\nCUT TO\n\ncentre stage. The JUGGLER is as before but the spaghetti is covering his head, having slipped off the third plate.\n\nThe FLOOR MANAGER is bustling around, trying to help.\n\nWe CUT BACK to back-stage. GRANDFATHER has finished being measured and goes to the green table where he put his plate down. He picks up the only remaining plate, looks at it, wondering where his food has gone, shrugs and heads back towards the exit door as we hear the DIRECTOR's VOICE.\n\n51.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\n\nCLOSE-UP on the distraught DIRECTOR.\n\nDIRECTOR\nWhere are they? I said, where are they? Where are they?\n\nFLOOR MANAGER\n(placating)\nThey're coming, I promise you.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(fiercely)\nNow look, if they're not here on this floor in thirty seconds there's going to be trouble ... understand me ... trouble!!!\n\nTwo STAGE HANDS are walking disinterestedly past, they look at the DIRECTOR.\n\n1st STAGE HAND\nWhat's he on about, Taff?\n\nWELSH STAGE HAND\nWell ... he's being the director. Of course, he lives in a world of his own, mind.\n\nAt this moment the boys, NORM, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER appear. The BOYS grab their instruments and prepare to play.\n\nJOHN\n(to the director)\nStanding about, eh? Some people have it dead easy, don't they?\n\nThe director is about to blow his top but manages to hold on and mutter to the heavens.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(to himself)\nOf course, once you're over thirty, you're finished. It's a young man's medium and I just can't take the pace.\n\nRINGO\nAre you as young as that, then?\n\nBOYS\nShurrup!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nIsn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.\n\nPAUL\n(to Shake)\nShove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?\n\nSHAKE\nI'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.\n\nPAUL\n(threateningly)\nI'll set John on you!\n\nSHAKE\n(hastily)\nOh, anything you say, Paul.\n\nHe leads GRANDFATHER away.\n\nThe BOYS are placed in position, instruments ready. The boom moves in near them. There is a mike hovering just over JOHN'S head. JOHN starts attacking it.\n\nDIRECTOR'S VOICE (over Tannoy)\nRun through the number and try not to jiggle out of your positions.\n\nThe BOYS start the number, as the stage hands adjust their settings. When they've finished, they stand about spare.\n\n52.\tINTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM\n\nThe room is crowded with the usual personnel, P.A., elecs, racks, etc.... make-up supervisor and wardrobe mistress.\n\nDIRECTOR\nThat was more or less all right for me. I'll give them one more run through then leave them alone until the dress ...\n(to make-up woman)\nOh how about make-up?\n\nMAKE-UP WOMAN\nNot really, they don't need it any. We'll just powder them off for shine.\n\nDIRECTOR\nGood. Norm, get them along to make-up will you?\n\nNORM\n(rising)\nSure.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(looking into the monitor)\nAnd hurry, they're not looking too happy.\n\nFrom the director's P.O.V. we see into the monitor. The boys crowding around RINGO. We cut through the monitor into the same position in the studio.\n\n53.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\n\nPAUL\n(to Ringo)\nWhat's the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.\n\nRINGO\n(briefly)\nYou were twanging too loud.\n\nJOHN\nHow'd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?\n\nGEORGE\nYou're getting out of hand. I don't know what's come over you today.\n\nRINGO\nThat's right. It's always me, isn't it?\n\nJOHN\nSince you ask, yes.\n(he laughs)\nAah, come on, Ring, we love you.\n\nHe puts his arm around Ringo's shoulder.\n\nRINGO\nWell!\n\nJOHN\nHe'll get over it.\n\nNORM appears down the ramp speaking as he approaches.\n\nNORM\nAll right, our lot, make-up.\n\n54.\tINTERIOR  MAKE UP ROOM\n\nA smallish room with a line of chairs facing a wall mirror and a long table. Each place is clearly marked and above each mirror a girl's name: Betty, Angela, Deirdre, Jenny.\n\nSHAKE and GRANDFATHER are sitting in splendid isolation. They are staring each other out.\n\nSHAKE\nYou blinked!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI never did, you did.\n\nThe BOYS enter.\n\nSHAKE\nHello, he's not talking to me. He's having a sulk.\n\nGEORGE\nWell, it must be catching. He's given it to the\nchamp here.\n\nHe indicates RINGO who ignores him.\n\nNORM\nStop picking on him.\n\nRINGO\nI don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.\n\nJOHN\nLeave him alone, he's got swine fever.\n\nNORM\nSit down, the lot of you.\n\nAt this moment several actors come into the room. They are all dressed in the uniform of officers in Wellington's army. Together with the boys they sit down, Beatles and soldiers all mixed up.\n\nNow a group of several pretty make-up girls make an entrance and the boys herald their arrival with a chorus of \"aye aye's\" and wolf whistles. JOHN meanwhile has helped himself to a big beard and the other lads are generally messing about with assorted make-up things.\n\nHEAD MAKE UP GIRL\nOh, this is impossible! We'll never get you all done in time.\n\nACTOR\nWell, you'll just have to do us first... It makes no difference to them whether they're made up or not.\n(sees John with beard)\nAnd who's me, then?\n\nJOHN\n(charmingly)\nMy name's Betty...\n(pointing to the name on the mirror)\nDo you want a punch up your frogged tunic?\n\nNORM fights his way to JOHN.\n\nNORM\nNow listen, John, behave yourself or I'll murder you and, Shake, take that wig off, it suits you.\n\nSHAKE has a long blond girl's wig on. With the assistance of the girls, NORM gets the boys seated into the chairs nearest the door. For some reason RINGO now has a Guardsman's busby wedged down almost over his eyes and is sitting with it under a hair drier, reading a copy of \"Queen\" Magazine.\n\nNORM\n(to Ringo)\nWhat do you think are you're up to?\n\nRINGO\nSomeone put it on me.\n\nJOHN\nExcuses, that's all we get and you know you fancy yourself in the Coldstreams.\n\nThe GIRLS now move in and put make up bibs on the BOYS and start to powder them off.\n\nJOHN\nYou won't interfere with the basic rugged\nconcept of my personality, will you, girl?\n\nPAUL\nEh, don't take out me lines.\n\nGEORGE\nYeah, they give him that \"Je ne sais quoi\"\nrakish air.\n\nThe lads laugh with pleasure.\n\nRINGO decides to try a little joke.\n\nRINGO\n(indicating the busby he is still\nwearing)\nShort back and sides, please.\n\nThe other look at him with mock disgust.\n\nPAUL\nBehave...\n\nJOHN\nForeign devil ...\n\nGEORGE\nControl yourself...\n\nGRANDFATHER has been watching the powdering process.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nIn my considered opinion you're a bunch of sissies.\n\nJOHN grabs a powder puff from his girl.\n\nJOHN\nYou know you're only jealous!\n\nAnd dabs the old man liberally with the powder much to GRANDFATHER's annoyance.\n\nNORM\nLeave him alone, Lennon, or I'll tell them all the truth about you.\n\nJOHN\nYou wouldn't!\n\nNORM\nI would though.\n\nNORM goes out.\n\nPAUL\nWhat's he know?\n\nJOHN\nNothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(impatiently)\nLookit, I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery and so far I've seen a train and a room, a car and a room and a room and a room. Well, that's maybe all right for a bunch of powdered gee-gaws like you lot but I'm feeling decidedly strait-jacketed. This is no life for a free-booting agent of my stamp. I'm a frustrated man and that class of McCartney is a dangerous McCartney.\n\nGIRL\n(admiringly)\nWhat a clean old man.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(touchingly)\nYou're too young for a fella of my cosmopolitan tastes, so don't press your luck.\n\nJOHN\nHe's sex-obsessed, the older generation are leading this country to galloping ruin.\n\nNORM returns leaving the door open, the boys hear the sound of music coming from the studio.\n\nNORM\nThey're nearly ready for you. They're just finishing the band call.\n\nJOHN\n(jumping from his seat)\nGear! Come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.\n\nJOHN'S GIRL\nI don't think its allowed.\n\nJOHN\nWell ... it wouldn't be any fun if it was!\n\nThe BOYS drag the make-up GIRLS out of the room and into the studio.\n\nThe GIRLS are still trying to finish making the BOYS up.\n\nAs the BOYS and MAKE-UP GIRLS dance past, we see one of the \"Strauss\" singers combing his long hair straight back. Two STAGE HANDS swing a wind machine past him and his hair is blown straight forward into a Beatle cut.\n\nJOHN\n(passing him)\nNever.\n\nDuring dance, GEORGE takes off wig and places it on dummy, revealing identical hair underneath.\n\n55.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\n\nThe work is still going on and the music is up full blast, the BOYS enter and with the GIRLS [and] they start a wild dance, hippy, shake, zulu, blue beat, the lot. LIONEL and DANCERS are doing their routine on one side of the stage ... it becomes a challenge dance between both groups. JOHN swings his GIRL onto the motorized CAMERA, Western style, and starts to track through the GROUP. GEORGE is on another CAMERA.\n\n56.\tINTERIOR  CONTROL ROOM\n\nThe whole control room crew are watching the dance on all the monitors. The DIRECTOR is about to stop the boys but his GIRL P.A. glares at him, with a shrug he lets the dance go on.\n\nWe now cut between the dancers on the monitors and the boys actual dancing down on the studio floor. When the recorded music stops, they grab their instruments and go into a number.\n\nSo we can watch every aspect of their work and with so many monitors it gives the impression that there are many more boys than just four.\n\nWhen the number finally ends we are back in the studio on the floor.\n\n57.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\n\nDIRECTOR'S VOICE OVER TANNOY\nThank you gentlemen, you can break now while we push on with the show.\n\nThe boys acknowledge this with a quaver of guitar chords and a drum roll.\n\nNORM is on them at once.\n\nNORM\nThat was great, you've got about an hour but don't leave the theatre.\n\nJOHN grabs the arm of a sexy girl dancer.\n\nJOHN\nShe's going to show me her stamp collection.\n\nPAUL\n(grabs a showgirl)\nSo's mine.\n\nNORM\nJohn, I'm talking to you. This final run through is important. Understand? Important.\n\nJOHN\n(like a pig)\nOink! Oink!\n\nThey dash off with the two beauties.\n\nGRANDFATHER is hovering in the background with SHAKE.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI want me cup of tea.\n\nNORM\nShake.\n\nSHAKE\nI'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.\n\nNORM\nClever.\n(he turns)\nGeorge.\n\nBut GEORGE is disappearing out of the door.\n\nNORM turns to RINGO.\n\nNORM\nLook after him.\n\nRINGO\nBut...\n\nNORM\nDo I have to raise me voice?\n\nRINGO\n(choked)\nOh, all right. Come here, Grandad.\n\nAnd the two of them walk off, Ringo leading.\n57A.\tINTERIOR  BACKSTAGE\n\nA man, whose act is playing tunes by hitting himself on the head, is swallowing a handful of aspirin tablets. He starts rehearsing his act, which consists of throwing his head back and slapping his cheeks. Next to him, a JUGGLER is practising with four table tennis balls.\n\nGRANDFATHER passes him and bumps his arm slightly. Only 3 balls come down. There is the sound of coughing off.\n\nWe\n\nCUT TO\n\nTHE HEAD-PLAYER being patted on the back. The ball drops out of his mouth and bounces slowly on the studio floor.\n\n58.\tINTERIOR  T.V. STUDIO CANTEEN\n\nThe canteen is about half full of actors many of which are dressed as Nazi soldiers, with mock blood bandages and arm bands. Also there are a sprinkling of T.V. people. At a table sits GRANDFATHER and RINGO. RINGO is deeply engrossed in a book and GRANDFATHER has a near empty cup of tea in front of him. The old man is bored and looks about him slyly. He then looks at Ringo who is innocently occupied, a malicious gleam comes into GRANDFATHER's eye. He decides to have a go at RINGO and sits staring at him. RINGO gradually becomes aware of the stare and shifts uncomfortably then tries to continue reading his book.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(disgustedly to no one in particular)\nWill you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!\n\nRINGO\nWell ... what's the matter with that?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(taking the book from him)\nHave you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?\n\nRINGO\n(snatching back his book)\nYou can learn from books.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nCan you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.\n\nRINGO\nOut where?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAny old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!\n\nRINGO\n(defiantly)\nBooks are good!\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(countering)\nParading's better!\n\nRINGO\nParading?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(marching up and down the canteen)\nThat's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!\n\nRINGO\nWell, I am living, aren't I?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYou're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?\n\nRINGO\nEh ... you're a bit old for that sort of chat, aren't you?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAt least I've a backlog of memories, but all you've got is that book!\n\nRINGO\nAaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nSo you are a man after all.\n\nRINGO\nWhat's that mean?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nDo you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.\n\nRINGO\n(not too sure)\nOh ... I dunno.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(confidingly)\nAnd that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.\n\nRINGO\nYeah ... that's right.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd what's it all come to in the end?\n\nRINGO\n(defensively)\nYeah ... what's in it for me?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nA book!\n\nRINGO\nYeah ... a bloomin' book!\n\nHe throws the book down.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWhen you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.\n\nRINGO\nYeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(nodding)\nYou're only right.\n\nRINGO\n(nodding back)\nI'm not wrong.\n\nThere is a pause, then RINGO rises and crosses to the door.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWhere are you off to?\n\nRINGO\nI'm going parading before it's too late!\n\nRINGO leaves and GRANDFATHER laughs at what he has done, then realizes its full meaning and looks worried.\n\n59.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR and STAIRWAY\n\nRINGO comes along the corridor then down the narrow stairs. Half-way down he comes face to face with GEORGE who is coming up the stairs.\n\nGEORGE\nEh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?\n\nRINGO\n(passing him)\nNo. I don't.\n\nAs he goes round the corner RINGO turns on the surprised GEORGE.\n\nRINGO\nYou want to stop being so scornful, it's twisting your face.\n\n60.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOORMAN'S OFFICE\n\nJOHN and PAUL are chatting up a couple of girls, when they see RINGO approaching they break off the conversation.\n\nJOHN\nHere he is, the middle-aged boy wonder.\n\nRINGO looks at JOHN hard.\n\nPAUL\nEh. I thought you were looking after the old man.\n\nRINGO\n(with simple dignity)\nGet knotted!\n\nPAUL and JOHN gape at him. For good measure Ringo takes a quick photograph of them before he leaves them flabbergasted and walks off into the street.\n\nPAUL\nWe've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.\n\nJOHN\nCan't he? He's done it, son!\n\nGEORGE runs towards them.\n\nGEORGE\nEh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...\n\nPAUL\nWe do.\n\nGEORGE\nYes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.\n\nPAUL\nHe hasn't.\n\nGEORGE\nYes, he's filled his head with notions seemingly.\n\nPAUL\nThe old mixer, come on we'll have to put him right.\n\nThe three of them go into the street.\n\n61.\tEXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE\n\nThe boys look up and down but RINGO has completely disappeared.\n\nPAUL\nWe'll split up and search for him, he can't be far.\n\nThey now all start to go off in the same direction, they pause, there are three roads they can take but each time they begin to move they all go the same way.\n\nJOHN\nIt's happened at last, we've become a limited company.\n\nGEORGE\nI'll look in here again.\n\nPAUL gives him a push to the left and GEORGE to the right and going straight ahead himself they part and go their separate ways.\n\n62.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nRINGO is walking along taking photographs with his camera when some girls recognise him and start to follow him. They quicken their pace and RINGO runs ahead of them. He turns and comes into another street. He sees a second-hand clothes shop with a sign saying \"We Buy Anything\" and enters the shop just before the pursuing girls come round the corner. The girls stand about looking in all directions. After a moment RINGO comes out of the shop. He is wearing a long mackintosh and a natty cap pulled well down. He is ignored by the girls who don't recognise him. Realising this he goes back and ogles one of them. She glares at him.\n\nRINGO\nHello.\n\nGIRL\nGet out of it, short house!\n\nCLOSE-UP on Ringo's secret but happy smile as he walks briskly down the road.\n\n63.\tEXTERIOR  TOW PATH  CANAL\n\nRINGO kicks at a brick. He kicks stylishly but misses so tries again, misses again, but finally kicks the stone which doesn't budge so he bends down and pulls it out of the ground. It is quite big. Three quarters of it being below the surface. Having got it he now decides to throw it away. As he does so the same POLICEMAN rides past on a bicycle.\n\nPOLICEMAN\nAin't you got no more bleeding sense than to go round chucking bricks about.\n\nBefore RINGO has time to answer the man has disappeared.\n\nRINGO\n(shouting after him)\nSoutherner!\n\nHe looks at the canal water moodily; at this moment a large lorry tyre rolls down the incline and bashes him slap in the back, sprawling him on the path, the tyre on top of him. A small boy appears after the tyre and stands over the prostrate RINGO.\n\nBOY\nHere, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.\n\nRINGO\nHoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?\n\nBOY\nOh don't be so stroppy!\n\nRINGO\n(getting up)\nWell! A boy of your age bowling \"hoop\" at people. How old are you anyway?\n\nBOY\n(aggressively)\nNine.\n\nRINGO\nBet you're only eight and a half.\n\nBOY\n(countering swiftly)\nEight and two thirds.\nRINGO\nWell, there you are and watch it with that hoop.\n\nBOY\nGerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.\n\nRINGO\nShurrup!\n\nBOY\nI bet you're\n(searching for an age)\n-- sixteen!\n\nRINGO\nFifteen and two thirds, actually.\n\nBOY\nWell --\n\nRINGO\nAll right, take your hoop and bowl.\n\nHe moves off and the BOY follows.\n\nBOY\nOh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.\n\nRINGO\nY'what?\n\nBOY\nYou heard, it gets on my wick.\n\nRINGO\nWell that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?\n\nBOY\nI'm a deserter.\n\nRINGO\n(smiling in spite of himself)\nAre you now?\n\nBOY\nYeah, I've blown school out.\n\nRINGO\nJust you?\n\nBOY\nNo, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.\n\nRINGO\nDing Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?\n\nBOY\nYeah, that's right, they was supposed to come\nwith us but they chickened.\n\nRINGO\nYeah? And they're your mates are they?\n\nBOY\n(sighing)\nYeah.\n\nRINGO\nNot much cop without 'em, is it?\n\nBOY\n(defensively)\nOh, it's all right.\n\nRINGO\n(disbelievingly)\nYeah?\n\nBOY\nYeah.\n\nRINGO\nWhat they like?\n\nBOY is glad to have something to talk about.\n\nBOY\n(enthusiastically)\nGinger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.\n\nRINGO\nHow about Ding Dong?\n\nBOY\nHe's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.\n\nRINGO nods his head understandingly and they mooch on together.\n\nBOY\nWhy aren't you at work?\n\nRINGO\nI'm a deserter, too.\n\nBOY\nOh.\n\nAt this moment a child's voice shouts out \"Charley\" and from RINGO'S P.O.V. we see three kids. RINGO turns to the BOY and looks at them enquiringly.\n\nBOY\n(to Ringo)\nSee you.\n\nThe BOY runs off to join his mates. As he joins them they punch and scuffle together. They are obviously a gang. RINGO is left alone.\n\n64.\tINTERIOR  CORRIDOR T.V. THEATRE\n\nGEORGE comes round the corner, looking for RINGO, then grins and walks past a sign saying \"Canteen and Production Office Opposite.\" He comes to the exit door, crosses to a modern building across from the theatre. He enters [the] building.\n\n65.\tINTERIOR  OFFICE\n\nIt is the reception room that leads to an inner office. Behind a desk sits a smart young woman typing busily as GEORGE enters. He is surprised when he sees the girl; she looks up and speaks to him at once.\n\nSECRETARY\nOh, there you are!\n\nGEORGE\nOh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.\n\nSECRETARY\n(tartly)\nYou haven't, you're just late.\n(She rises and crossing over to him examines him critically.)\nOh, yes, he's going to be very pleased with you.\n\nGEORGE\nIs he?\n\nSECRETARY\nYes, you're quite a feather in the cap.\n(She crosses to the desk and picks up the inter-office phone.)\nHello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.\n(she smiles)\nOf course, right away.\n\nShe crosses to the inter-office door. On the door is written SIMON MARSHAL ... she opens it.\n\nSECRETARY\nWell ... come on.\n\nGEORGE\nSorry.\n\nHe follows her quickly in.\n\n66.\tINTERIOR  THE INNER OFFICE\n\nA large room, part production office with models and sets, drawing board with ground plans, the other part of the room a mixture of Pop and Queen's magazine decor.\n\nBehind a large desk sits SIMON MARSHAL, a bland but slightly irritable young man of about thirty-five. He is wearing the ultimate in the current smart set fashion. He is attended by a couple of underlings ADRIAN and TONY and behind him on the wall is a poster of a girl. Across the poster is printed, \"Way Out, your own T.V. Special with Susan Campey. Director, Simon Marshal.\"\n\nSECRETARY\n(proudly)\nWill this do, Simon?\n\nSIMON\n(looking at George)\nNot bad, dolly, not really bad.\n(he motions to George)\nTurn around, chicky baby.\n\nGEORGE does so.\n\nSIMON\nOh yes, a definite poss. He'll look good alongside Susan.\n(he indicates the girl on the poster)\nAll right, Sunny Jim, this is all going to be quite painless. Don't breathe on me, Adrian.\n\nADRIAN has recognised GEORGE and is trying to stop SIMON.\n\nGEORGE\nLook, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.\n\nSIMON\n(sharply)\nOh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.\n\nGEORGE\nI'm afraid I don't understand.\n\nSIMON\nOh, my God, he's a natural.\n\nSECRETARY (anxiously)\nWell, I did tell them not to send us any more real ones.\n\nSIMON\nThey ought to know by now the phonies are much easier to handle. Still he's a good type.\n\nHe now speaks to GEORGE in the loud voice that the English reserve for foreigners and village idiots.\n\nSIMON\nWe want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.\n\nGEORGE\nOh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.\n\nSIMON\nWell, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.\n(to secretary)\nCan he read?\n\nGEORGE\nOf course I can.\n\nSIMON\nI mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?\n\nGEORGE\nI'll have a bash.\n\nSIMON\nGood. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?\n\nGEORGE\nTa.\n\nSIMON\nWell, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.\n\nA collection of shirts are produced and GEORGE looks at them. While he is doing this SIMON briefs him.\n\nSIMON\nNow, you'll like these. You really \"dig\" them. They're \"fab\" and all the other pimply hyperboles.\n\nGEORGE\nI wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.\n\nSIMON\nGrotty?\n\nGEORGE\nYeah, grotesque.\n\nSIMON\n(to secretary)\nMake a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.\n\nGEORGE\nBut I won't.\n\nSIMON\nYou can be replaced you know, chicky baby.\n\nGEORGE\nI don't care.\n\nSIMON\nAnd that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.\n\nGEORGE\nAnd who's this Susan when she's at home?\n\nSIMON\n(playing his ace)\nOnly Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.\n\nGEORGE\nOh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?\n\nSIMON\nI beg your pardon?\n\nGEORGE\nOh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.\n\nSIMON\nShe's a trend setter. It's her profession!\n\nGEORGE\nShe's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.\n\nSIMON\nGet him out of here!!\n\nGEORGE\n(genuinely surprised)\nHave I said something amiss?\n\nSIMON\nGet him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!\n\nThe underlings hustle GEORGE to the door.\n\nGEORGE\n(smiling)\nSorry about the shirts.\n\nHe is ejected through the door.\n\nSIMON\nGet him out.\n(he stops in mid-shout)\nYou don't think he's a new phenomenon, do you?\n\nSECRETARY\nYou mean an early clue to the new direction?\n\nSIMON\n(rummaging in his desk)\nWhere's the calendar?\n(he finds it)\nNo, he's just a trouble maker. The change isn't due for three weeks. All the same, make a note not to extend Susan's contract. Let's not take any unnecessary chances!\n\n67.\tEXTERIOR  STREET  PUB ON THE CORNER\n\nThe sign on the pub is Liverpool Arms. RINGO is standing looking up at it. He decides to go in and does so.\n\n68.\tINTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM\n\nThe atmosphere is tense. GRANDFATHER is standing miserable in front of the DIRECTOR, the criminal confronted by the judge. SHAKE and NORM are flanking him grimly.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI'm sorry lads, I didn't mean it, honest.\n\nDIRECTOR\nIf he says that again, I'll strike him.\n\nSHAKE\n(unconvincingly)\nThey'll be back, they're good lads, they'll be back.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(disgusted)\nYes? Well they've got only ten minutes to the final run-through.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI meant no harm. I was only trying to encourage little Ringo to enjoy himself.\n\nNORM\n(grimly, C.U.)\nGod knows what you've unleashed on the unsuspecting South. It'll be wine, women and song all the way with Ringo once he's got the taste for it.\n\n69.\tINT. PUB  PUBLIC BAR\n\nCLOSE-UP on RINGO. He is eating a bone dry sandwich that curls up at the end. He puts it down with disgust. He has a lager glass in his hand.\n\nBARMAID\n(accusingly)\nThat was fresh this morning.\n\nWe now see the pub is full of enormous cockney workmen downing pints. RINGO is very much alone. He moves away from the bar towards a group that is standing together, they've an average height of over six-foot. There is a group at a dart board. Another group is playing bar skittles and a third group is around a pin-ball table.\n\nNear the bar is a shove-halfpenny board with two players. There is a caged parrot nearby.\n\nBARMAID\n(to Ringo)\nThat'll be two and nine...\n\nRINGO fumbles some change out of his pocket. A few coppers fall from his hand on to the shove-halfpenny board just as the crucial point has been made. The men glare at him. Embarrassed, he moves away and without looking, places his glass on the skittles table just as a player swings the string, which hits Ringo's glass. More embarrassed, RINGO backs\naway, unfortunately into the pin-table just as a winning score is about to be reached. He bumps it very slightly, but enough to cause it to TILT. He then moves to the dart board. By this time most of the pub is staring at him. With great style he takes the darts. The first throw goes into a cheese sandwich which a man is pointing in demonstration. The second we see arrive into a pint of bitter and then we see RINGO shoot the third dart and hear the sound of the parrot shouting angrily, off. The BARMAID has had enough.\n\nBARMAID\nRight ... On your way!\n\nRINGO\nY'what?\n\nBARMAID\nYou heard, on your way, troublemaker!\n\nNow the centre of attention, RINGO backs out of the pub, followed by every eye in the place, the BARMAID and a few players following him to the door ...\n\n70.\tEXTERIOR  STREET OUTSIDE PUB\n\nRINGO comes out and crosses road, watched by the POLICEMAN who is now quite suspicious.\n\n71.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nPAUL comes down the street looking about him for RINGO. In the street is an old building, the sort of place that is highly favoured for TV rehearsals. There is a sign on the door, \"TV Rehearsal Room.\" As PAUL draws near, a load of actors and extras, etc. are leaving, they are in costume, they are the ones who earlier had been going to a word rehearsal. When PAUL gets near the entrance he decides to go inside.\n\n72.\tINTERIOR  HALL\n\nPAUL enters and wanders about. He reaches a door, pushes it open and looks in. He sees a GIRL clad in period costume. She is moving around the room and obviously acting. PAUL watches her for a moment and then decides to go in.\n\n73.\tINTERIOR  REHEARSAL ROOM\n\nPAUL goes into the room. The GIRL is in mid-flight. She is very young and lovely and completely engrossed in what she is doing. The room is absolutely empty except for PAUL and herself. She is acting in the manner of an eighteenth-century coquette, or, to be precise, the voice English actresses use when they think they are being true to the costume period ... her youth however makes it all very charming.\n\nGIRL\nIf I believed you, sir, I might do those things and walk those ways only to find myself on Problem's Path. But I cannot believe you, and all those urgings serve only as a proof that you will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with me.\n\nShe dances lightly away from an imaginary lover and as she turns she sees PAUL who is as engrossed in the scene as she was.\n\nGIRL\n(surprised)\nOh!\n\nPAUL\n(enthusiastically)\nWell ... go 'head, do the next bit.\n\nGIRL\nGo away! You've spoilt it.\n\nPAUL\nOh, sorry I spoke.\n\nHe makes no attempt to go. He simply continues to look steadily at the girl; then he smiles at her. She is undecided what to do next.\n\nGIRL\nAre you supposed to be here?\n\nPAUL\nI've got you worried, haven't I?\n\nGIRL\nI'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.\n\nPAUL\nD'you know something, \"They\" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...\n\nGIRL\nYou're from Liverpool, aren't you?\n\nPAUL\n(ironically)\nHow'd you guess?\n\nGIRL\n(seriously)\nOh, it's the way you talk.\n\nPAUL\n(innocently)\nIs it ... is it, really?\n\nGIRL\n(suspiciously)\nAre you pulling my leg?\n\nPAUL\n(looking her straight in the eye)\nSomething like that.\n\nGIRL\n(unsure)\nI see.\n(airily)\nDo you like the play?\n\nPAUL\nYeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.\n(smiles to himself)\nYeah, it's gear on a girl.\n\nGIRL\nGear?\n\nPAUL\nAye, the big hammer, smashing!\n\nGIRL\nThank you.\n\nPAUL\nDon't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?\n\nGIRL pouts.\n\nPAUL\nYou don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...\n\nGIRL\n(cutting in)\nI'm not ...\n\nPAUL\nOh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?\n\nGIRL\nNo.\n(aggressively)\nI'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.\n\nPAUL\nOh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?\n\nGIRL\nYes.\n\nPAUL\nAye, I knew you were.\n\nGIRL\nWhat's that mean?\n\nPAUL\nWell, the way you were spouting, like ....\n(he imitates her)\n\"I don't believe you, sir...\" and all that. Yeah, it was gear.\n\nGIRL\n(dryly)\nThe big hammer?\n\nPAUL\n(smiling)\nOh aye, a sledge.\n\nGIRL\nBut the way you did it then sounded so phony.\n\nPAUL\nNo ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.\n\nHe moves and stands about like an actress.\n\nGIRL\nBut that's not like a real person at all.\n\nPAUL\nAye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?\n\nGIRL\nThey ought to be.\n\nPAUL\nOh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?\n\nGIRL\n(teasingly)\nWhat are you?\n\nPAUL\nI'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.\n\nGIRL\nI bet you don't sound like real people.\n\nPAUL\nWe do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.\n\nGIRL\nIs it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?\n\nPAUL\nWhat of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.\n\nHe laughs and with a gesture takes in the whole studio\n\nPAUL\n... all this and a jam butty too!!\n\nGIRL\nI only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.\n\nPAUL\nWhy? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?\n\nGIRL\nWhy selfish?\n\nPAUL\nWell, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.\n\nShe looks at him in surprise.\n\nPAUL\nNo, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, \"Go and give some to the other kids.\" So, I said I would but I thought to meself, \"She must think I'm soft.\" Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't nmind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?\n\nGIRL\nNot really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?\n\nPAUL\nWell, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?\n\nGIRL\nIs she?\n\nPAUL\nOf course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...\n(Paul starts acting a Liverpool girl, he minces about then turns, extending his leg)\nEh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!\n\nGIRL\n(shattered)\nAnd you honestly think that's what she meant?\n\nPAUL\nOh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.\n\nHe laughs.\n\nGIRL\nWell, it's nice to know you think we're clever.\n\nPAUL\n(grinning)\nAnd cunning.\n\nGIRL\nAnd what do you do about it?\n\nPAUL\nMe? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.\n\nGIRL\nPity.\n\nPAUL\n(not noticing the invitation)\nAye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.\n\nGIRL\nYes.\n\nPAUL\n(going)\nSee you.\n\nGIRL\nOf course.\n\nPAUL stands at the doorway, shrugs then goes out.\n74.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nIn the street, workmen are collecting shovels, drinking tea and doing all the things people do around building sites. RINGO mooches around. In the road is a hole with a diameter of about 3 feet, and at least 6 feet deep. RINGO looks down and a man is busily working at the bottom of the hole. He glares at RINGO. After a moment RINGO turns away. We now see a very elegant young lady coming towards RINGO. She is daintily avoiding a series of puddles. RINGO has an idea and does a Sir Walter Raleigh with his large Mac spreading it over one of the puddles. The girl walks across it smiling graciously. RINGO proceeds with the coat to the next puddle and to the next backing gradually towards the hole. At last he spreads the coat, without noticing what he is doing, over the hole. The girl steps onto the coat and disappears sharply. RINGO looks down the hole where the girl is held in the workman's arms. The workman rises out of the manhole until he is waist height. At this point an elegantly dressed gentleman appears (the girl's husband) he looks at his wife in the workman's arms and hits the workman. RINGO backs away through the puddles, and is nicked by the POLICEMAN.\n\n[Scenes 75 and 76 deleted in revision.]\n\n77.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  NEAR STAGE DOOR\n\nThe DIRECTOR is pacing up and down the corridor. NORM is also walking up and down, SHAKE is leaning against the wall quite unconcerned. NORM gives SHAKE a push.\n\nNORM\nWorry, will you!\n\nSHAKE adjusts his features to a worrying expression.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(bitterly)\nWell, that's it, two minutes to the final run-through... they're bound to miss it...\n\nNORM\nI'll murder that Lennon.\n\nDIRECTOR\nBut I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...\n\nSHAKE\n... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, wouldn't it like.\n\nNORM\nShurrup, cheerful.\n\nThe horrible prospect hits the DIRECTOR.\n\nDIRECTOR\nYou don't think...\n\nNORM\n(reassuring him)\nThey'll be here.\n\nDIRECTOR\nOh now, they can't do that to me.\n(turning on Norm)\nIt's all your fault.\n(overriding Norm)\nOh yes it is and if they don't turn up I wouldn't be in your shoes for all the...\n\nSHAKE\n(helping out)\n... tea in China. Oh you're right, neither would I.\n\nHe steps away from NORM and stands near the DIRECTOR.\n\nNORM\nTraitor!\n\nSHAKE nods his agreement to this assessment of his character.\n\nSHAKE\nOf course.\n\nAt this moment JOHN, GEORGE and PAUL enter from the stage door. They are completely unconcerned and walk past the DIRECTOR, SHAKE and NORM.\n\nJOHN\n(as he passes by)\nHi Norm!\n\nNORM\n(preoccupied)\nHi, our lot!\n\nThe BOYS walk on when after a moment NORM snaps to.\n\nNORM\nOur lot!\n\nGEORGE\n(mildly)\nDid you want something.\n\nNORM\n(beaming with delight)\nI could eat the lot of you.\n\nJOHN\nYou'd look gear with an apple in your gob.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(accusingly)\nDo you realise you could have missed the final run-through?\n\nGEORGE\nSorry.\n\nSHAKE\nEh, there's only three of them.\n\nPAUL\nAye, we were looking for Ringo. But we realised he must have come back.\n\nDIRECTOR\nDo you realise we are on the air, live, in front of an audience, in forty-five minutes and you're one short.\n\nJOHN\nControl yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.\n\nNORM\nAye, let's try the dressing room.\n\nEveryone starts along the passage. NORM and PAUL last.\n\nPAUL\nEh, where's my grandfather?\n\nNORM\nDon't worry about him. He can look after himself.\n\nPAUL\nAye, I suppose so.\n\nThey run after the others.\n\n78.\tEXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  CLOSE-UP\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHere they are, personally signed and handwritten by your own sweet boys. The chance of a lifetime. Be the envy of your less fortunate sisters!\n\nThe CAMERA PULLS back and we see GRANDFATHER is surrounded by girls who have broken from the queue and are doing a brisk trade with the old man. He has a large sign on which is written: \"Get your genuine autographed Beatles photographs.\" On the edge of the crowd two POLICEMEN are trying to force the girls back into the queue. Finally they wade through the girls and confront GRANDFATHER. They look at the old man quizzically; he stares back coldly. They indicate he should hop it and quick but GRANDFATHER defiantly glares back at them. So with a sigh, they grab an arm each and escort the old man off.\n\n79.\tINTERIOR  POLICE STATION\n\nIt is the reception desk and behind it is the DESK SERGEANT. After a moment RINGO is dragged in by the POLICEMAN we saw him with before.\n\nRINGO\nLook, I'm Ringo Starr... I've got a show to do in a few minutes you've got to let me go... I'm Ringo...\n\nPOLICEMAN\nSure, they all say that these days ... Anyway ... I don't care who you are... you can save that for the stipendary. Here you are, Sarge.\n\nSERGEANT\nWhat is he?\n\nPOLICEMAN\n(reeling off the list)\nI've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.\n\nSERGEANT\nOh, a little savage, is he?\n\nPOLICEMAN\nA proper Aborigine.\n\nRINGO\n(on his dignity)\nI demand to see me solicitor.\n\nSERGEANT\nWhat's his name?\n\nRINGO\nOh, well if you're going to get technical --\n\nAt that moment there is a loud series of noises off camera, furious shouting and dull crashes of wood.\n\nSERGEANT\nHello, it's going to be one of those nights, is it?\n(to policeman)\nSit Charley Peace down over there.\n\nThe POLICEMAN takes RINGO to a bench and sits him down as GRANDFATHER and the two POLICEMEN who were with him enter. The sign is tattered and is being lugged after them.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWell, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.\n(kicks the nearest policeman)\nOh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.\n\nSERGEANT\nIs there a fire, then?\n\nGRANDFATHER leans across the desk and hisses at the SERGEANT.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYou ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.\n\nSERGEANT\nEh?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.\n\nSERGEANT\nWhat's he on about?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(squaring up)\nI'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.\n\nSERGEANT\n(to policemen)\nGet Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.\n\nThe POLICEMEN hurtle GRANDFATHER firmly but gently over to the bench on which RINGO is sitting and then return to the desk for a whispered conference with the SERGEANT. Meanwhile in full conspiratorial fashion GRANDFATHER talks to RINGO out of the side of his mouth.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nRingo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?\n\nRINGO\nWell I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nShush! Have they roughed you up yet?\n\nRINGO\nWhat?\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(whispering)\nKeep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.\n\nRINGO\n(disturbed)\nHave they?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThat sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.\n\nRINGO\n(horrified)\nMe!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.\n\nRINGO\n(hopefully)\nOh, they seem all right to me.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThat's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.\n\nSERGEANT\n(calling)\nWould you two like a cup of tea?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nYou see, sly villains.\n\nRINGO\n(miserable)\nNo thanks, Mr. Sergeant, sir.\n\nWe now have a CLOSE SHOT of POLICEMEN around the sergeant's desk.\n\nSERGEANT\nSo you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.\n\nPOLICEMAN\nYeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.\n\nSERGEANT\nWell, he can't stop here.\n\nShot of GRANDFATHER watching POLICEMEN intently and muttering words as he does.\n\nRINGO\nWhat are you doing?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nLip reading.\n\nRINGO\nWhat are they saying?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nNothing good.\n\nThe POLICEMEN make a move towards GRANDFATHER and RINGO.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nWell son, it's now or never.\n\nHe jumps to his feet and scurries towards the door.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nAll right, you paid assassins. Johnny McCartney'll give you a run for your threepence ha'penny.\n\nHe dashes out of the door followed by the POLICEMAN who has his pile of photos.\n\nSERGEANT\nNow, what's he up to?\n\nRINGO\nHe's allergic to Bobbies, especially English Bobbies.\n\nThe POLICEMAN with the photos returns.\n\nPOLICEMAN\n(Irish accent)\nYour man disappeared like a leveret over a hill.\n\nRINGO\nTurncoat!\n\nThe POLICEMEN turn on RINGO and walk towards him.\n\nCLOSE-UP  RINGO\n\nRINGO\nMother!\n\n80.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\n\nGRANDFATHER is running at top speed down the street. He is breathing heavily and runs as if pursued by the hounds of hell. The street however is entirely empty and no one is even in sight. As he reaches the top of the street he pauses and turning, looks around him. From his P.O.V. we see just how empty the street is and heaving a sigh of relief GRANDFATHER cackles to himself. His triumph is short lived. At this precise moment down the street comes a parade of police vehicles, a Black Maria, an escorting police motor bike patrol and an ordinary squad car. The procession draws up and the street is full of policemen getting out of the Black Maria and squad car and off motor bikes.\n\nCLOSE-UP  GRANDFATHER's horrified face.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nBe God, they've called up reinforcements, the dragnet's out!\n\nHe dashes off wildly in the general direction of the theatre. He has been completely unnoticed by the policemen who are lining up for a last minute inspection by the inspector in charge. The inspector is like a commander-in-chief of a spear-head attack force.\n\nThey smartly march off in the direction taken by GRANDFATHER.\n\n81.\tINTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  CONTROL ROOM\n\nDIRECTOR\n(watching the clock)\nOnly half an hour and you're on!\n\nGEORGE\nCan I say something?\n\nThe director clutches at any straw.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(hopefully)\nYes, anything.\n\nGEORGE\n(earnestly)\nIt's highly unlikely we'll be on... I mean the law of averages are against you and it seems that, etc., etc....\n\nBut his speech is drowned by the pitiful moans of the DIRECTOR.\n\n82.\tEXTERIOR  T.V. THEATRE  STAGE DOOR\n\nThe four little boys from the canal are being driven away by the\nsecurity guard.\n\nGUARD\n(going back into theatre)\nI'll have the hides off of you lot.\n\nThe kids retreat as GRANDFATHER pants into shot, ignoring the kids he enters the stage door but in a second he is out again, grasped firmly by the collar by the security guard.\n\nGUARD\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go home!\n\nGRANDFATHER\nI must see Pauly.\n\nGUARD\nGo home then and see him on the telly.\n\nThe GUARD re-enters the stage door.\n\nGRANDFATHER looks around him and sees the four kids. He hustles over and after a whispered conference we hear his offer.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nCan you fix him for me?\n\nBOYS\nYeah.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nSixpence.\n\nBOY\nEach?\n\nGRANDFATHER is about to argue.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nOh, all right.\n\nBOY\nAnd in advance.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(disgusted)\nMercenary!\n\nBut he hands over the money. The kids rush in the stage door and after a moment the furious GUARD chases them out and down the alley. GRANDFATHER, chuckling, nips in the door.\n\n83.\tINTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM  ON STAGE\n\nGRANDFATHER is being chased by several studio attendants; he is dodging behind equipment. He finally gets on a sound boom trolley and uses it as a weapon to keep his pursuers at bay.\n\n84.\tINTERIOR  T.V. CONTROL ROOM\n\nThe DIRECTOR, BOYS, and NORM and SHAKE see GRANDFATHER on the monitors. They dash out of the room and on to the stage.\n\nDIRECTOR\n(shouting)\nIt's all right, leave him alone.\n\nPAUL\nGrandad, where's Ringo?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nThe police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.\n\nBOYS\nThe police station.\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHe'll be pulp by now.\n\nJOHN\nWhat are we waiting for?\n\nGEORGE\nCome here.\n\nPAUL, JOHN and GEORGE rush off.\n\nCLOSE-UP DIRECTOR\n\nDIRECTOR\nWe've only got twenty minutes.\n\n85.\tEXTERIOR  STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION\n\nPAUL, JOHN and GEORGE come running down the street in single file, their knees  high in the air, they skid to a halt at the police station and without pausing they dash inside. After a moment they reappear -- only this time RINGO is behind them. They dash off down the street. They are followed at once by ten POLICEMEN also in single file. They are also pounding along knees high in the air. The BOYS and the coppers disappear around the corner. At once, they reappear from the other direction, then run down the street still followed by the policemen. When they reach the police station another group of police bars their way so they are forced to run up the stairs and inside.\n\n86.\tINTERIOR  POLICE STATION\n\nThe DESK SERGEANT is standing behind his desk looking very surprised. At this moment the boys run in and stand panting in front of the desk. Before the SERGEANT can start speaking the pursuing POLICEMEN arrive. They, too, are out of breath.\n\nSERGEANT\nWhat is all this?\n\nJOHN\n(heaving and panting)\nHold on until we get our breath.\n\nThe BOYS and POLICEMEN pant on until JOHN seems to have recovered.\n\nSERGEANT\nAll right now?\n\nJOHN\nSure.\n(to boys)\nReady?\n\nThe BOYS nod and without further ado they turn and run through the surprised rank of POLICEMEN and out into the street.\n\n87.\tEXTERIOR  STREET\nTHE CHASE CARRIES ON.\n\nShots of BOYS being pursued (still in single file) by police, including the sergeant with one shot where the BOYS are chasing the POLICEMEN. Finally, as they approach the theatre, they are seen by the girl fans who swarm around the police, over running them. The boys grin to each other and are about to make off when from their P.O.V. we see the INSPECTOR and POLICEMEN blocking it.\n\nJOHN\nAh well, it was worth a try.\n\nINSPECTOR\n(calling to Sergeant)\nWhat do you think you're up to?\n\nSERGEANT\nArrest those boys, sir.\n\nINSPECTOR\nThat's all we need to start a real riot!\n(to Boys)\nCome on lads, they're waiting for you.\n\n###\tINTERIOR  THEATRE BACKSTAGE\n\nThe Inspector now hustles the BOYS through the crowds and in through the main entrance of the theatre where SHAKE and NORM are waiting. NORM looks suspiciously at RINGO who is still wearing his cap. RINGO whips it off and NORM delightedly hugs him. The BOYS dash through the stalls entrance and on stage. The DIRECTOR sees them and bursts into tears with relief. NORM hustles the lads into the wings to be changed into their show costumes. All around them last-minute preparations are going on.\n\nDIRECTOR\nBoys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.\n\nNORM\nAren't you supposed to be in that box?\n\nThe DIRECTOR gives NORM a final glare and dashes off.\n\nPAUL\nAnd another thing, where's that old mixer?\n\nGRANDFATHER\nHere, Pauly.\n\nAnd sitting on a box sadly chastened sits GRANDFATHER.\n\nPAUL\nWell, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.\n\nJOHN\nAw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.\n\nPAUL\n(hotly)\nWhat's old got to do with it?\n\nJOHN\nYou needn't bother.\n\nPAUL\nY'what?\n\nJOHN\nPractising to be thick-headed, you're there already.\n\nPAUL\nLook he's a mixer and a trouble maker!\n\nJOHN\nThat's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?\n\nFrom JOHN's P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER. He looks what he is, a tired old man.\n\nJOHN\nYou see.\n(to Grandad)\nYou know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. You'd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you're a lonely old man from Liverpool.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(fighting back)\nBut I'm clean.\n\nThe BOYS giggle and slap him on the back.\n\n88.\tINTERIOR  TV THEATRE AUDITORIUM\n\nWe see the audience of girls streaming in and settling down in their places for the show. There is the usual business of getting the show ready and we see SHOTS of the girls' faces, then JOHN, PAUL, RINGO and GEORGE looking at them. At last on cue from the floor manager the BOYS start their act to the audience's screams. During the number we constantly CUT away to the audience with various SHOTS of the ecstatic girls. In the middle of these shots we see NORM standing at the side of the audience his face glowing with satisfaction. We follow his gaze and from NORM'S P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER handcuffed to SHAKE, but in spite of this, the old man is enjoying himself. The BOYS now perform a medley of numbers, i.e., a little of all the songs we have heard during the story. This gives the impression of a full set and we finish after their bows. While they are doing so they look again in the general direction of SHAKE and GRANDFATHER and from their P.O.V., we see SHAKE is beating time to the music but from his wrist dangles an empty set of handcuffs. GRANDFATHER has gone again. As the BOYS are reacting to GRANDFATHER's disappearance once again, the trap door on the stage opens and GRANDFATHER appears in the centre of the group as they finish their act and take their final bows.\n\n89.\tINTERIOR  STUDIO CORRIDOR\n\nNORM is waiting for the boys. With him are two studio attendants carrying the boys' luggage. As the BOYS excitedly appear he speaks to hem.\n\nNORM\nI've got the stuff. Come here.\n\nPAUL\nAren't we ...\n\nNORM\nNo, we're not!\n\nHe hurries them along.\n\nNORM\nThe office was on the phone, they think it'd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.\n\nJOHN\nTonight? We can't make it ...\n\nNORM\nYou've got a midnight matinee.\n\nJOHN\nNow, look here, Norm ...\n\nNORM\nNo, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.\n\nJOHN\nWhat?\n\nNORM\nYou're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!\n\nNORM turns down a side exit where the door is open to the field. In it is an eight-passenger helicopter.\n\n90.\tEXTERIOR  STAGE DOOR  T.V. THEATRE\n\nThe BOYS and NORM come out of the building and start to run towards the helicopter.\n\nPAUL\n(looking behind him)\nWhere's my grandfather?\n\nNORM\n(arriving at helicopter door)\nDon't start. Look.\n\nThe boys look in the passenger bay and there is GRANDFATHER. He is still handcuffed to SHAKE but clutching his pile of photos.\n\nGRANDFATHER\n(beckoning them in with his free hand which holds the photos)\nCome on, you're hanging up the parade.\n\nThe boys shout \"Get rid of those things, etc.\"\n\n91.\tEXTERIOR  FIELD\n\nThe final shot is of the helicopter rising up (SHOT FROM BELOW). As it disappears, a shower of photos come from its window.\n\nWe cut to a CLOSE-UP of one signed photo as it hits the ground and SUPER the closing credits over it.Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

Saint Patrick LyricsPatrick was born at Emptur:\nThis it is that history relates to us.\nA child of sixteen years (was he)\nWhen he was taken into bondage.\n\nSuccat was his name, it is said;\nWho was his father is thus told:\nHe was son of Calpurn, son of Otidus,\nGrandson of Deochain Odissus.\n\nHe was six years in slavery;\nHuman food he ate it not.\nCothraige he was called,\nFor as slave he served four families.\nVictor said to Milcho's slave:\n\"Go thou over the sea:\"\nHe placed his foot upon the *leac* (stone):\nIts trace remains, it wears not away.\n\nHe sent him across all the Alps;\nOver the sea marvellous was his course,\nUntil he stayed with Germanus in the south,\nIn southern Letha.\n\nIn the islands of the Tyrrhene Sea he stayed;\nTherein he meditated:\nHe read the canon with Germanus:\nIt is this that history relates.\n\nTo Ireland he was brought back\nIn visions by the angels of God:\nOften was he in vision\nSolicited to return thither again.\n\nSalvation to Ireland\nWas the coming of Patrick to Fochlaidh;\nAfar was heard the sound\nOf the call of the youths of Caill-Fochladh.\n\nThey prayed that the saint would come,\nThat he would return from Letha,\nTo convert the people of Erin\nFrom error to life.\nThe Tuatha of Erin were prophesying\nThat a new kingdom of faith would come,\nThat it would last for evermore:\nThe land of Tara would be waste and silent.\n\nThe druids of Loegaire concealed not from him\nThe coming of Patrick;\nTheir prophecy was verified\nAs to the kingdom of which they spoke.\n\nPatrick walked in piety till his death:\nHe was powerful in the extirpation of sin:\nHe raised his hands in blessing\nUpon the tribes of men.\n\nHymns, and the Apocalypse, and the thrice fifty (psalms)\nHe was won't to sing;\nHe preached, baptized and prayed;\nFrom the praise of God he ceased not.\n\nThe cold of the weather deterred him not\nFrom passing the night in ponds:\nBy heaven his kingdom was protected;\nHe preached by day on the hills.\n\nIn Slan, in the territory of Benna-Bairche,\nHunger or thirst possessed him not.\nEach night he sang a hundred psalms,\nTo adore the King of angels.\nHe slept on a bare stone,\nAnd a wet sack-cloth around him;\nA bare rock was his pillow;\nHe allowed not his body to be in warmth.\n\nHe preached the Gospel to all;\nHe wrought great miracles in Letha;\nHe healed the lame and the lepers;\nThe dead he restored to life.\n\nPatrick preached to the Scoti:\nHe endured great toil in Letha:\nWith him will come to judgment\nEveryone whom he brought to the life of Faith.\n\nThe sons of Emer, the sons of Eremon,\nAll went to Cisal,\nTo the abode of Satan --\nThey were swallowed up in the deep abyss,\n\nUntil the apostle came to them:\nHe came despite the raging tempests:\nHe preached, for three-score years,\nThe cross of Christ to the tribes of Feni.\n\nOn the land of Erin there was darkness;\nThe Tuatha adored the -sidhi-;\nThey believed not\nIn the true Deity of the true Trinity.\n\nIn Armagh there is sovereignty;\nIt is long since Emain passed away;\nA great church is Dun-Lethglasse;\nI wish not that Tara should be a desert.\n\nPatrick, when he was in sickness,\nDesired to go to Armagh:\nAn angel went to meet him on the road\nIn the middle of the day.\n\nPatrick came southwards towards Victor;\nHe it was that went to meet him;\nThe bush in which Victor was, was in a blaze;\nFrom the flame (the angel) spoke.\n\nHe said: Thy dignity (shall be) at Armagh;\nReturn thanks to Christ;\nTo heaven thou shalt come;\nThy prayer is granted thee.\n\nThe hymn which thou chosest in life\nShall be corselet of protection to all.\nAround thee on the Day of Judgment\nThe men of Erin will come for judgment.\n\nTassach remaineth after him (in Sabhall),\nHaving given the communion to him:\nHe said that Patrick would return:\nThe word of Tassach was not false.\n\nHe (St. Patrick) put an end to night;\nLight ceased not with him:\nTo a years' end there was radiance;\nIt was a long day of peace.\n\nAt the battle fought around Beth-horon\nAgainst the Canaanites by the son of Nun,\nThe sun stood still at Gaboan;\nThis it is that the Scripture tells us.\n\nThe sun lasted with Josue unto the death of the wicked:\nThis indeed was befitting;\nIt was more befitting that there should be radiance\nAt the death of the saints.\n\nThe clergy of Erin went from every part\nTo watch around Patrick;\nThe sound of harmony fell upon them,\nSo that they slept enchanted on the way.\n\nPatrick's body from his soul\nWas severed after pains;\nThe angels of God on the first night\nKept choir around it unceasingly.\n\nWhen Patrick departed (from life)\nHe went to visit the other Patrick;\nTogether they ascended\nTo Jesus, Son of Mary.\n\nPatrick, without arrogance or pride,\nGreat was the good which he proposed to himself,\nTo be in the service of Mary's Son;\nHappy the hour in which Patrick was born.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

sugar, you look kinda sweet\nCuter than a baby walkin' down the street\nWhen I look into your eyes, I wanna leap\nI can't conceal that you make me feel\n\n[Chorus]\nLike a tiger, ooh-ooh-ooh\nLike a tiger, ooh-ooh-ooh\nJust to see you smile\nNearly drives me wild\nI wanna growl, wow!\n[Verse 2]\nI'm feelin' stronger than a grizzly bear\nSoarin' like an eagle flyin' through the air\nWhen I get you in my arms, you'd better beware\nI go insane 'cause I can't be tamed\n\n[Chorus]\nLike a tiger, ooh-ooh-ooh\nLike a tiger, ooh-ooh-ooh\nJust to see you smile\nNearly drives me wild\nI wanna growl, wow!\n\n[Bridge]\nYou keep my heart jumpin' like a kangaroo\nFloatin' like an onion in a bowl of stew\nBaby, every time you come in view\nI run like an antelope to get to you\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm your tiger, and you're my mate\nHurry up, buttercup, and don't be late\nI might get mad if I have to wait\nCome right now 'cause I'm on the prowl\n\n[Chorus]\nLike a tiger, ooh-ooh-ooh\nLike a tiger, ooh-ooh-ooh\nJust to see you smile\nNearly drives me wild\nI wanna growl, wow!\nYou might also like[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Bridge]\nYou keep my heart jumpin' like a kangaroo\nFloatin' like an onion

myself a little job\nI'm going to buy me a little car\nDrive my girl in the park\nDon't bother us, leave us alone\nAnyway we almost grown\n\n[Verse 3]\nGot my eye on a little girl\nAh, she's really

just me\nAnd I wished that I could love her too\n\nBut I'd left my heart on the hangin' tree\nI'd left my heart with a memory (a memory)\nAnd a faded dream on the hangin' tree\n\n(The hangin' tree)\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow there were men who craved my gold\nAnd meant to take (ooh) my gold from me\nWhen a man is gone he needs no gold\n\nSo they carried me to the hangin' tree\nTo join my dreams and a memory (a memory)\nYes, they carried me to the hangin' tree\n\n(The hangin' tree)\n\n[Verse 4]\nTo really live you must almost die (wop doo-wah)\nAnd it happened just that way with me (wop

friends believed they were\nToo young to know the score\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause she was only seventeen\nAnd he was one year more\n\n[Verse 2]\nAre they old enough to know\nIf love will last for life?\nIsn't he too young\nTo be a husband her a wife?\n\n[Bridge]\nWell in the past I bet it's happened\nMore than once before\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen someone was seventeen\nAnother one year

be, like, messy\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm so insecure, I think\nThat I'll die before I drink\nAnd I'm so caught up in the news\nOf who likes me and who hates you\nAnd I'm so tired that I might\nQuit my job, start a new life\nAnd they'd all be so disappointed\n'Cause who am I if not exploited?\nAnd I'm so sick of seventeen\nWhere's my fucking teenage dream?\nIf someone tells me one more time\n\"Enjoy your youth,\" I'm gonna cry\nAnd I don't stick up for myself\nI'm anxious, and nothing can help\nAnd I wish I'd done this before\nAnd I wish people liked me more\n[Chorus]\nAll I did was try my best\nThis the kinda thanks I get?\nUnrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)\nThey say these are the golden years\nBut I wish I could disappear\nEgo crush is so severe\nGod, it's brutal out here\n\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI feel like no one wants me\nAnd I hate the way I'm perceived\nI only have two real friends\nAnd lately, I'm a nervous wreck\n'Cause I love people I don't like\nAnd I hate every song I write\nAnd I'm not cool, and I'm not smart\nAnd I can't even parallel park\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I did was try my best\nThis the kinda thanks I get?\nUnrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)\nThey say these are the golden years\nBut I wish I could disappear\nEgo crush is so severe\nGod, it's brutal out here\nYou might also like[Post-Chorus]\n(Yeah)\n(Just havin' a really good time)\n\n[Outro]\nGot a broken ego, broken heart\n(Yeah, it's brutal out here, yeah, it's brutal out here)\nAnd God, I don't even know where to start133Embed"}]
