"lyrics": "The Vampire, His Kith And Kin - Chapter 5 LyricsCHAPTER V\n\nTHE VAMPIRE IN LITERATURE\n\nA consideration of the Vampire theme in literature must of necessity be somewhat eclectic, if not even arbitrary in the selection of works which it reviews and with which it sets out to deal. Any exhaustive inquiry is well-nigh impossible, and this not so much, perhaps, on account of the wealth of the material, although indeed there is a far vaster field than might generally be supposed, as owing to the very vague definition and indeterminate interpretation one is able to give to vampirism from a purely literary point of view. It is the craft of an artist in the telling of ghost-stories to see that his colours should not be too vivid and too clear, and no mean skill is required to suggest without explanation, to mass the shadows without derangement, to be occult yet not to be obscure. Accordingly it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to differentiate the malignant and death-dealing spectre or it may be even corpse who returns to wreak his foul revenge from the Vampire,--using this latter word in its widest sense, as one must employ it when speaking of literature, a caution which here given as regards this Chapter will serve once for all. In such a story, for example, as Dr. M. R. James' Count Magnus[1] is the horrible revenant a ghost or a vampire? The writer has left the point ambiguous. It is of the very essence of his happy invention that he should do so, and the deftly veiled incertitude adds to the loathly terror of the thing. It will be readily remembered that the story relates how a traveller in Sweden about the middle of the last century whilst staying near an ancient manor house in Vestergothland obtains permission to examine the family papers and among these he comes upon the traces of a certain Count Magnus de la Gardie who in the year 1600 had built the house or herrg\u00e5rd. Even after the lapse of two and a half centuries dark traditions are still lingering concerning this mysterious nobleman, whose body lies in a richly ornate copper sarcophagus that stands the principal feature of a domed mausoleum at the eastern end of the church. Reluctantly the landlord tells a story which happened in the time of his grandfather ninety-two years before. Two men determined to go at night and have a free hunt in the woods upon the estate. They are warned: \"No, do not go; we are sure you will meet with persons walking who should not be walking. They should be resting, not walking.\" The two men laughed and cried: \"The Count is dead; we do not care for him.\" But in the night the villagers \"hear someone scream, just as if the most inside part of his soul was twisted out of him.\" Then they hear a hideous laugh, \"it was not one of those two men that laughed, and, indeed, they have all of them said that it was not any man at all.\" In the morning they go out with the priest, and they find one of the men dead, killed in so terrible a fashion that they buried him on the spot. \"He was once a beautiful man, but now his face was not there, because the flesh of it was sucked away off the bones.\" The other man is standing with his back against a tree, \"pushing with his hands-pushing something away from him which was not there.\"\n\nThere was some vague gossip that the Count had been \"on the Black Pilgrimage, and had brought something or someone back with him.\" During his investigation of the papers the English traveller, Mr. Wraxall, found a Liber nigrae peregrinationis, or at least a few lines of such a document indicating that the Count had once journeyed to the city of Chorazin and there adored the prince of the air. In careless mood as he is passing near the mausoleum, Mr. Wraxall exclaims: \"Ah, Count Magnus, there you are. I should dearly like to see you.\" He is indiscreet enough to cry out thus flippantly on two further occasions, and at last he is thoroughly alarmed by hearing the sound of metal hinges creaking and he knows that the sarcophagus is slowly opening wide. In a state of frenzied fear he sets out for England the next day, yet turn and double as he will he is everywhere haunted by two hideous figures, a man in a long black cloak and a broad-leafed hat and something in a dark cloak and hood. Upon landing at Harwich he makes his way across country to a neighbouring village, when on looking out of the carriage window he sees at a cross-road the two horrible creatures. He finds a lodging, but within the next forty-eight hours his pursuers fall upon him. He is discovered dead, and in the district it is still remembered how \"the jury that viewed the body fainted, seven of 'em did, and none of 'em wouldn't speak to what they see, and the verdict was visitation of God; and how the people as kep' the 'ouse moved out that same week and went away from that part.\"\n\nThis story may, I think, certainly be considered as Vampire lore, and although it must, of course, be perfectly familiar to all who delight in tales of the supernatural I have related it at some little length here, partly because it is told so excellently well, and partly because it so admirably fulfils and exemplifies the qualities that this kind of literature should possess. It is brief and succinct, although there are many details, but every touch tells. No ghost story should be of any length. The horror and the awe evaporate with prolixity. The ghost is malevolent and odious. In fiction a helpful apparition is a notable weakness, and the whole narrative becomes flabby to a degree. The authentic note of horror is struck in the eerie suggestion which, as we have noticed, is of intent left ill-defined. Nothing could be more crude than an explanation, and it is this banality that often ruins a story which otherwise might be of the very first order.\n\nTo review the traces of vampire legends which appear in sagas, and which are in truth but few and unimportant, seems to be outside our province here, and even more foreign to our purpose would be the present examination of the vampire legend in folk-lore since this has already been dealt with in the course of the preceding chapters, and to regard such traditions merely as literature would be not only to look at them from a wrong perspective but to misrepresent their quality and essentially to pervert their purpose.\nSince some point must be chosen at which to consider vampirism in literature we may most fairly recall to mind the many academic and philosophical treatises upon the Vampire which were rehearsed and discussed in German Universities during the earlier part of the eighteenth century, and these startling themes soon began to attract the attention of poets and literary men. Thus among the poems of Heinrich August Ossenfelder[2] we have a short piece entitled Der Vampir, which is as follows:\n\nMein liebes M\u00e4gdchen glaubet\nBest\u00e4ndig steif und feste,\nAn die gegebnen Lehren\nDer immer frommen Mutter\nAls V\u00f6lker an der Theyse\nAn t\u00f6dtliche Vampiere\nHeyduckisch feste glauben,\nNun warte nur Christianchen,\nDu willst mich gar nich lieben;\nIch will mich an dir r\u00e4chen,\nUnd heute in Tockayer\nZu einem Vampir trinken.\nUnd wenn du sanfte schlummerst,\nVon deinen sch\u00f6nen Wangen\nDen frischen Purpur saugen.\nAlsdenn wirst du erschrecken,\nWenn ich dich werde k\u00fcssen\nUnd als ein Vampir k\u00fcssen:\nWann du dann recht erzitterst\nUnd matt in meine Arme,\nGleich einer Todten sinkest\nAlsdenn will ich dich fragen,\nSind meine Lehren besser,\nAls deiner guten Mutter?\nThe poet Wieland[3] has a passing reference to the Vampire\n\nDer J\u00fcngling aus den Wolken\nHerab gefallen, stumm und bleich,\nAls h\u00e4tt' ein Vampyr ihm die Adern ausgemolken,\nSteht ganz vernichtet von dem Streich.[4]\n\nIt would be an exaggeration to say that the Vampire entered German literature with Goethe's famous ballad Die Braut von Korinth, but it would be difficult to over-estimate the influence and the popularity of this piece, the subject of which is directly derived from Phlegon of Tralles. The young Athenian who visits his father's old friend to whose daughter he has been betrothed receives at midnight the Vampire body of the girl whom death has prevented from becoming his bride, and who declares:\n\nAus dem Grabe werd' ich ausgetrieben,\nNoch zu suchen das vermifste Gut,\nNoch den schon verlornen Mann zu lieben Und zu saugen seines Herzens Blut.\nIst's um den geschehn,\nMuss nach andern gehn,\nUnd das junge Volk erliegt der Wut.[6]\n\nEven more famous are the charnel horrors of B\u00fcrger's Lenore which was first printed in 1773 in the Gottinger Musenalmanach and which notwithstanding the legions of hostile comments and parodies whereof Brandl gives an ample list[6] has remained a household word.\n\nIn spite of the immense enthusiasm at that date in contemporary England for German romantic literature it is remarkable that no translation of Lenore was published here until 1796, when William Taylor of Norwich printed in the Monthly Review of March his rendering which in some respects must be called an adaptation. He had, however, by his own account written the translation as early as 1790,[7] and there can be no doubt that very shortly after its completion it was declaimed, applauded and much discussed in Norwich literary circles. We know that Mrs. Barbauld who visited Edinburgh \"about the summer of 1793 or 1794\"[8] read aloud Taylor's version to a number of enthusiastic admirers. This event was described to Sir Walter Scott by Miss Cranstoun, afterwards Countess Purgstall,[9] although Scott himself mentions that his curiosity \"was first attracted to this truly romantic story by a gentleman, who, having heard Lenore once read in manuscript, could only recollect the general outline, and part of a couplet, which, from the singularity of its structure, and frequent recurrence,[10] had remained impressed on his memory.\"[11] This gentleman Was Mr. Cranstoun, the brother of Countess Purgstall, and so her statement is no doubt accurate as Scott might well have received his account both from the brother as well as from the sister. It was in the course of 1794, or at any rate early in the following year that Scott made his own rendering of the ballad. The account of Taylor's version, Ellenore, which \"electrified\" the assembled company at Dugald Stewart's house when read by the famous Anna Letitia Barbauld had given him the strongest desire to see the original. Just about this time, however, it was a difficult matter to procure books from the continent, and it was not until after some delay that a copy of B\u00fcrger's works was conveyed to him from Hamburg. He immediately devoured the German ballad and was so impressed that he forthwith set about Englishing it. \"I well recollect\" he writes, \"that I began my task after supper, and finished it about daybreak next morning.\"[12] Scott's friends privately printed a few copies of the poem as a surprise for the author,\" and as it went from hand to hand it met with the most flattering reception. In 1796, besides the public issue of the translations from B\u00fcrger by Taylor and by Scott, no less than three other versions appeared, from the several pens of W. R. Spencer, H. J. Pye and J. T. Stanley. The translation by the last named author was given to the public in an \u00e9dition de luxe at five shillings, as well as in the ordinary edition of half a crown.[14] In 1797, a pasquil followed, Miss Kitty: a Parody on Lenora, a Ballad, \"Translated from the German, by several Hands,\" whilst in the following year, Mrs. Taylor turned the popular poem into Italian as a \"Novella Morale.\"[15] Probably the most faithful, if not the most spirited translation, was that by the Rev. J. Beresford which was published in 1800.\n\nIt was in 1797 that Coleridge wrote the first part of Christabel, and German critics have somewhat superfluously endeavoured to emphasize herein the influence of Lenore, since upon examination it would hardly seem that such is present even in the smallest degree. For example, if the narrative of Geraldine be carefully read[16] it must be evident that the following judgment of Professor Brandl is without foundation. This critic writes: \"Ihre Vorgeschichte (of Geraldine) sch\u00f6pfte er grossentheils aus B\u00fcrgers 'Lenore' in Taylors Uebersetzung: die Dame ist, wenigstens ihrer Erz\u00e4hlung nach, auf einem windschnellen Ross entf\u00fchrt und halbtodt vor Furcht hier abgesetzt worden; statt des schwarzen Leichenzuges, der Lenoren auf ihrem Ritt durch die Mondnacht aufstiess, will sie 'den Schatten der Nacht' gekreuzt haben; noch zittert das verdorrte Blatt neben ihr wie aus Herzenangst.\"[17]\n\nAs we might expect, the young Shelley was enchanted by Lenore, and Medwin relates how the poet long treasured cc a copy of the whole poem, which he made with his own hand.\"[18] Dowden tells the story how one Christmas Eve Shelley dramatically related the B\u00fcrger ballad with appropriate intonation and gesture \"working up the horror to such a height of fearful interest \"that the company fully expected to see Wilhelm stalk into the parlour.\" In his study of Shelley, Charles Middleton has remarked: \"It is hinted, somewhat plausibly, that the Leonora of B\u00fcrgher first awakened his poetic faculty. A tale of such beauty and terror might well have kindled his lively imagination, but his earliest pieces, written about this time, and consisting only of a few ballads, are deficient in elegance and originality, and give no evidence whatever of the genius which soon after declared itself.\"[20] To suggest, as Zeiger would have it,[21] that Lenore influenced the poem which in the romance St. Irvyne[22] Megalina inscribes on the wall of her prison, and which commences:\n\nGhosts of the dead! have I not heard your yelling\nRise on the night-rolling breast of the blast, . . .\nis the merest ineptitude, since these verses are taken almost word for word from \"Lachin y Gair\" in Byron's Hours of Idleness, and that had been published some four years previously.[23]\n\nAs I have elsewhere shown in some detail, Shelley's two juvenile romances owe not only their inspiration but a great deal of their phrasing and noctivagations to Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya: or The Moor, which appeared in 1806, and which, as the poet himself declares \"quite enraptured\" him.[24] It is a very remarkable circumstance that in spite of the extremely plain hint which might profitably have been taken from such poems as Die Braut von Korinth and Lenore the novelists of the Gothic school, soaked though they were in German literature, searching the earth and the depths of the earth for thrills and sensation of every kind, do not seem to have utilized the tradition of the Vampire. It is a puzzle indeed if we ask how it was that such writers as Monk Lewis, \"Apollo's sexton,\" who would fain \"make Parnassus a churchyard\";[25] and Charles Robert Maturin who, as he himself confessed, loved bells rung by viewless hands, daggers encrusted with long shed blood, treacherous doors behind still more treacherous tapestry, mad nuns, apparitions,[26] et hoc genus omne; the two lords of macabre romance, should neither of them have sent some hideous vampire ghost ravening through their sepulchral pages. In the Gothic romance we have horror heaped on horror's head; mouldering abbeys, haunted castles, banditti, illuminati, sorcerers, conspirators, murderous monks and phantom friars, apparitions without number until the despairing reviewers cried aloud: \"Surely the misses themselves must be tired of so many stories of ghosts and murders.\" We have such titles as the famous Horrid Mysteries; The Midnight Groan; The Abbot of Montserrat, or, The Pool of Blood; The Demon of Venice; The Convent Spectre; The Hag of the Mountains;[27] and a hundred such lurid nomenclatures, but until we come to Polidori's novel which will be considered later, nowhere, so far as I am aware, do we meet with the Vampire in the realm of Gothic fancy. So vast, however, is this fascinating library and so difficult to procure are these novels of a century and a quarter ago that I hesitate sweepingly to assert that this theme was entirely unexploited. There may be some romance which I have not had the good fortune to find where a hideous vampire swoops down upon his victims, but if such be the case I am at least prepared to say that the Vampire was not generally known to Gothic lore, and had his presence made itself felt in the sombre chapters of one votary of this school I think he would have re-appeared on many occasions, for the writers were as accustomed to convey from one another with an easy assurance, as they were wont deftly to plunder the foreign mines. Inevitably one of the band, T. J. Horseley Carties, Francis Lathom, William Herbert, Edward Montague, Mrs. Roche, Eliza Parsons, Miss M. Hamilton, Mrs. Helme, Mrs. Meeke, Isabella Kelley, and many another beside insatiably agog for horrid phantasmagoria would have utilized the Vampire in some funereal episode.\n\nOne might even have supposed that the notes to Southey's Thalaba the Destroyer,[28] must have put them on the track, and surely stanzas eight, nine and ten in Book VIII could not have passed unnoticed:\n\nA night of darkness and of storms!\nInto the Chamber of the Tomb\nThalaba led the Old Man,\nTo roof him from the rain.\nA night of storms! the wind\nSwept through the moonless sky,\nAnd moan'd among the pillar'd sepulchres;\nAnd in the pauses if its sweep\nThey heard the heavy rain\nBeat on the monument above.\nIn silence on Oneiza's grave\nHer father and her husband sate.\nThe Cryer from the Minaret\nProclaim'd the midnight hour.\n\"Now, now!\" cried Thalaba;\nAnd o'er the chamber of the tomb\nThere spread a lurid gleam,\nLike the reflection of a sulphur fire\nAnd in that hideous light\nOneiza stood before them. It was She . . .\nHer very lineaments. . . . and such as death\nHad changed them, livid cheeks and lips of blue;\nBut in her eye there dwelt\nBrightness more terrible\nThan all the loathsomeness of death.\n\"Still art thou living, wretch? \"\nIn hollow tones she cried to Thalaba;\n\"And must I nightly leave my grave\nTo tell thee, still in vain,\nGod hath abandoned thee?\n\n\"This is not she!\" the Old Man exclaim'd;\n\"A Fiend; a manifest Fiend!\"\nAnd to the youth he held his lance;\n\"Strike and deliver thyself!\"\n\"Strike HER!\" cried Thalaba,\nAnd palsied of all power,\nGazed fixedly upon the dreadful form.\n\"Yea, strike her!\" cried a voice, whose tones\nFlow'd with such a sudden healing through his soul,\nAs when the desert shower\nFrom death deliver'd him;\nBut obedient to that well-known voice,\nHis eye was seeking it,\nWhen Moath, firm of heart,\nPerform 'd the bidding: through the vampire corpse\nHe thrust his lance; it fell,\nAnd howling with the wound,\nIts fiendish tenant fled.\nA sapphire light fell on them,\nAnd garmented with glory, in their sight\nOneiza's spirit stood.\n\nIt is important to remark that in his notes[29] upon this passage Southey cites at considerable length various cases of vampirism, particularly from the Lettres Juives, the Vampires of Gradisch, also the history of Arnold Paul, and the very ample account given by Tournefort. He further says: \"The Turks have an opinion that men that are buried have a sort of life in their graves. If any man makes affidavit before a judge, that he heard a noise in a man's grave, he [i.e., the body] is, by order, dug up and chopped all too pieces. The merchants (at Constantinople) once airing on horseback, had, as usual, for protection, a Janisary with them. Passing by the burying place of the Jews, it happened that an old Jew sat by a sepulchre. The Janisary rode up to him, and rated him for stinking the world a second time, and commanded him to get into his grave again--Roger North's Life of Sir Dudley North.\"[30]\n\nIt might perhaps not unfairly be argued that the two notorious romances of the Marquis de Sade Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu and Juliette depict scenes of vampirism, and if we are to take the word in any extended sense this is certainly the case. In the first place it must be remembered that as it passed through various editions-it was first issued in 1791, 2 vols., 8vo,--until it appeared in its final and complete form in 1797 as La Nouvelle Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu, suivie de l'Histoire de Juliette, sa soeur, 10 vols., 18mo (of which Justine occupies four and Juliette six) Justine was added to and augmented until the last version is practically double the length of the first, and the book has been entirely re-written. In Justine we have the episodes in the house of Monsieur Rodin, and more particularly the orgies of the Comte de Gernade who takes a lustful pleasure in watching the blood flow from the veins of his victims, as also the cruelties of the monster Roland all of which. may well be esteemed vampirism. Many similar scenes are described with great prolixity in Juliette, and this romance is distinguished by such horrible figures as the Muscovite giant Minski, whose favourite meat is human flesh, and in whose castle the table and chairs are made of bleaching bones, and Cordelli, the necrophilist of Ancona.\n\nIn The New Monthly Magazine,[31] 1 April, 1819, was published The Vampyre: a Tale by Lord Byron, which although it may seem to us--steeped in Le Fanu and M. R. James--a little old-fashioned, at the time created an immense sensation and had the most extraordinary influence, being even more admired and imitated on the Continent than in England. It was almost immediately known that actually the story did not come from the pen of Lord Byron, but had been written by Dr. John William Polidori, physician-companion to the poet. Byron had, as a matter of fact, been writing a work of the same title in imitation of Mrs. Shelley's Frankenstein, but he denied the authorship of this piece in the famous letter facsimilied in Galignani's edition of his works. A first printed, The Vampyre forms a part of extracts from \"A letter from Geneva, with Anecdotes of Lord Byron.\" Here is to be read that \"among other things which the lady, from whom I procured these anecdotes, related to me, she mentioned the outline of a ghost story by Lord Byron. It appears that one evening Lord Byron, Mr. p. B. Shelley, the two ladies and the gentleman (the daughters of Godwin and Dr. Polidori) before alluded to after having perused a German work, which was entitled Phantasmagoriana[32] began relating ghost stories; when his lordship having recited the beginning of Christabel, then unpublished, the whole took so strong a hold of Mr. Shelley's mind, that he suddenly started up and ran out of the room. The physician and Lord Byron followed, and discovered him leaning against a mantlepiece with cold drops of perspiration trickling down his face. After having given him something to refresh him, upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm, they found that his wild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the ladies with eyes (which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood where he lived) he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy the impression. It was afterwards proposed in the course of conversation, that each of the company present should write a tale depending upon some supernatural agency, which was undertaken by Lord Byron, the physician, and Miss M. Godwin. My friend, the lady above referred to, had in her possession the outline of each of these stories, I obtained them as a great favour, and herewith forward them to you, as I was assured you would feel as much curiosity as myself, to peruse the \u00e9bauches of so great a genius, and those immediately under his influence.\" Upon this the Editor has the following note: \"We have in our possession the Tale of Dr. ------ as well as the outline of that of Miss Godwin. The latter has already appeared under the title of 'Frankenstein, or the modern Prometheus'; the former, however, upon consulting this author, we may, probably, hereafter give to our readers.\"\n\nThe Vampyre is introduced by several paragraphs which deal with the tradition. This preamble commences: \"The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common; it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human bloodsuckers fattened--and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\"\n\nThe Editor then recounts the famous instance of Arnold Paul, and continues: \"We have related this monstrous rodomontade, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance we could adduce. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is doomed to vampyrise, but be compelled to confine his visitations solely to those beings he loved most while on earth-those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection. This supposition is, we imagine, alluded to in the following fearfully sublime and prophetic curse from the 'Giaour.'[32]\n\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent,\nThy corse shall from its tomb be rent;\nThen ghastly haunt thy native place,\nAnd suck the blood of all thy race;\nThere from thy daughter, sister, wife, p. 283\nAt midnight drain the stream of life;\nYet loathe the banquet, which perforce\nMust feed thy livid living corse,\nThy victims, ere they yet expire,\nShall know the demon for their sire;\nAs cursing thee, thou cursing them,\nThy flowers are withered on the stem.\nBut one that for thy crime must fall,\nThe youngest, best beloved of all,\nShall bless thee with a father's name--\nThat word shall wrap thy heart in flame!\nYet thou must end thy task and mark\nHer check's last tinge--her eye's last spark,\nAnd the last glassy glance must view\nWhich freezes o'er its lifeless blue;\nThen with unhallowed hand shall tear\nThe tresses of her yellow hair,\nOf which, in life a lock when shorn\nAffection's fondest pledge was worn--\nBut now is borne away by thee\nMemorial o thine agony!\nYet with thine own best blood shall drip\nThy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;\nThen stalking to thy sullen grave\nGo--and with Ghouls and Afrits rave,\nTill these in horror shrink away\nFrom spectre more accursed than they.\"\n\nAfter an allusion to Southey's Thalaba, Tournefort's Travels, and Dom Calmet's classical work, the editor concludes: \"We could add many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition, and we may, perhaps, resume our observations upon it at some future opportunity; for the present, we feel that we have very far exceeded the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation of the strange production to which we now invite the attention of our readers; and we shall therefore conclude by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several other synonimous with it, which are made use of in various parts of the world, namely, Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\"\n\nThe story tells how at the height of a London season there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose; some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward working of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass.\" This original is invited to every house, and in the course of the winter he meets \"a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey\" he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood.\" Aubrey is greatly fascinated by Lord Ruthven, for this is the name of the mysterious nobleman, and intending to travel upon the Continent he mentions this intention to my Lord, and is \"surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\"\n\nAs they travelled from town to town, Aubrey notices the peculiar conduct of his companion who bestows largess upon the most worthless characters, broken gamblers and the like, but refuses a doit to the deserving and virtuous poor. However the recipients of this charity \"inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they all were either led to the scaffold or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery.\" Eventually the travellers arrive at Rome, and here Aubrey receives letters from his guardians who require him immediately to leave his companion as since their departure from London the most terrible scandals, adulteries and seductions, have come to light. At Rome Aubrey is able to foil Lord Ruthven's plans, frustrating an intrigue designed to ruin a heedless young girl, and then he \"directed his steps towards Greece, and, crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens.\" Here he lodges in the house of a Greek, whose daughter Ianthe is a paragon of the most exquisite beauty. As he sketches the ruins of the city she is wont to entertain him with Greek legend and tradition, and \"often, as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heart-breaking to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\"\n\nBefore long it becomes evident that Aubrey is in love with Ianthe, \"and while he ridicules the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him.\" He endeavours to occupy his time with antiquarian excursions which lead him farther and farther afield, and at length he determines to proceed to a point beyond any he has as yet visited. When Ianthe's parents hear the name of the place he proposes to visit they most earnestly implore him on no account to return when once dusk has fallen, \"as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\"\n\nHaving given his promise to Ianthe that he will be back well before evening he sets out very early. The exploration, however, takes longer than he has supposed, and when he turns his horse homeward the darkness is already hurrying on urged by a terrific storm. The steed, alarmed at the battle of the elements dashes off at breakneck pace and only halts trembling and tired before a distant hovel in the heart of a solitary wood. \"As he approached, the thunder, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stiffled exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound.\" With a terrific effort Aubrey burst open the door and rushing into the darkness \"found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized, when a voice cried \"again baffled,\" to which a loud laugh succeeded, and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled but it was in vain; he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground; his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hand upon his throat, when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him--he instantly rose and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood was not longer heard.\" Several peasants now hastened into the hut bearing flambeaus which illuminate the scene, and to the horror of all there is discovered hard by, the lifeless body of Ianthe. A curious dagger lies near, but her death was not the result of a blow from this weapon. \"There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:--upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:--to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, 'a Vampyre, a Vampyre!'\" It appears that Ianthe had followed the traveller to watch over his safety. Aubrey is carried back to the city in a raging fever, and the parents of the unfortunate girl die brokenhearted owing to so terrible a loss.\n\nWhilst Aubrey lies ill Lord Ruthven arrives in Athens and establishing himself in the same house nurses the invalid with such care that past differences are forgotten, since Aubrey not only becomes reconciled to his presence but even seeks his company. Together they travel into the wildest interior of Greece, and here in some mountain pass they are attacked by brigands, from whose guns Lord Ruthven receives a shot in the shoulder. His strength strangely decreasing, a couple of days later it is plain to all that he is at the point of death. He now exacts a terrific oath that his companion shall conceal all that is known of him and that the news of his death shall not be allowed to reach England. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see.\" Aubrey binds himself most solemnly by the prescribed oath, and in a paroxysm of hideous laughter Ruthven expires.\n\nAccording to a promise which has been obtained from the robbers by a heavy bribe the body was conveyed to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon which rose after his death. Aubrey insists that it shall be interred in the ordinary way, but when he is conducted to the place it is found that the body has disappeared, and in spite of the protestations of the band he is convinced that they have buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes. One circumstance, however, gives Aubrey much food for thought. Among the effects of the deceased he discovered a sheath of most curious pattern and make which exactly fits the dagger that had been found in the deserted hut upon the occasion of Ianthe's death.\n\nReturning to England, as he retraces his journey through Rome to his horror Aubrey discovers that in spite of the precautions he had so carefully taken, Lord Ruthven succeeded only too well in his bad designs and now there is bitter sorrow and distress where once reigned peace and happiness. The lady had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship, and Aubrey instinctively divines that she has \"fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe.\"\n\nUpon his arrival in London the traveller is greeted by his sister, whose presentation into society had been delayed until her brother's return from the Continent, when he might be her protector. \"It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the busy scene.\" Upon this gay occasion the crowd was excessive, and as Aubrey heedless and distracted is watching the gay throng a voice which he recognizes only too well, whispers in this ear: \"Remember\n\np. 288\n\nyour oath.\" Turning he sees Lord Ruthven standing near him. A few nights later at the assembly of a near relation among the crowd of admirers by whom his sister is surrounded--the most prominent of the throng--he again perceives the mysterious and horrible figure. Hurrying forward he seizes his sister's arm and requests her immediately to accompany him home. However, before they have had time to retire again does the voice whisper close to him: \"Remember your oath!\"\n\nAubrey now becomes almost distracted. He sees no remedy against a monster who has already once mocked at death. Even if he were to declare all that he knew it is probable that he would hardly be believed. Whenever he attends a social gathering his looks as he scans the company become so suspicious and strange that he soon acquires a reputation for great eccentricity. As the months go on his loathing and his fears drive him well-nigh to madness, so that eventually a physician is engaged to reside in the house and take charge of him. He is a little consoled by the thought that when the year and the day have passed he will at least be able to unburden his mind and be at any rate freed from his terrible oath. It so happens that he overhears a conversation between the doctor and one of his guardians who enlarges upon the melancholy circumstance of her brother being in so critical a state when Miss Aubrey is to be married on the following day. He instantly demands the name of the bridegroom and is told the Earl of Marsden. He requests to see his sister and in an hour or two she visits him. As they are conversing she opens a locket and shows him a miniature of the man who has won her affections. To his horror he perceives that it is a portrait of Lord Ruthven and falling into convulsions of rage he tramples it under foot. In twenty-four hours the period of his oath will have expired, and he implores them to delay the wedding at least for that time. Since there seems no good reason for doing this the request is disregarded, upon which Aubrey falls into so sad a state of utter depression succeeded by an outburst of fury that the physician concludes him to be not far removed from lunacy and doubles the restraint. During the night the busy preparations for the nuptial are ceaselessly continued. It appears that upon the pretext of being her brother's dearest friend and travelling\n\np. 289\n\ncompanion Lord Ruthven had visited the house to inquire after Aubrey during his supposed derangement, and from the character of a visitor gradually insinuated himself into that of an accepted suitor. When the bridal party has assembled Aubrey, neglected by the servants, contrives to make his way into the public apartments which are decorated for the nuptials. Ere he can utter a cry, he is, however, at once perceived by Lord Ruthven who with more than human strength thrusts him, speechless with rage, from the room, at the same time whispering in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to-day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" The attendants at once secure the unhappy man, but he can no longer support his distress. In his agonies a blood vessel breaks and he is incontinently conveyed to bed. This sad accident is kept from his sister; the marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\n\n\"Aubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused--he died immediately after.\n\n\"The guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a Vampyre!\"\n\nIt were not easy to overestimate the astounding sensation which was caused by this story, and the narrative is certainly not without considerable merit, for in places the eerie atmosphere is well conveyed, Nor is it difficult to understand the extraordinary influence of the tale, since it introduced a tradition which had been long forgotten and which promised infinite possibilities in the way of that sensation and melodramatic calentures which the period craved. The first separate edition of The Vampyre appeared in 1819, and was published by Sherwood. The first issue of this, which is now very rare, contains a certain amount of preliminary matter concerning the Shelleys, Byron and Godwin. This was omitted in later issues, and accordingly one often finds that copies of The Vampyre are described as First Edition, which is strictly quite correct, although they are the Second Issue,\n\np. 290\n\nand naturally of far less value in a bibliographer's eyes. A large number of reprints increased with amazing rapidity and in the same year the novel was translated into French by Henri Faber, Le Vampire, nouvelle traduite de l'anglais de Lord Byron, Paris, 1819. In February, 1820, there followed under the aegis of Charles Nodier a very obvious imitation, or rather continuation by Cyprien B\u00e9rard, Lord Ruthwen ou les Vampires. \"Roman de C. B. Publi\u00e9 par l'auteur de Jean Sbogar et de Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Aubert.[34] Paris, 1820.\" In 1825, a new translation of Polidori's story was given by Eus\u00e8be de Salles. Nor was Germany behind hand, for The Vampyre was first translated in 1819: Der Vampyr. Eine Erzahlung aus dem Englischen des Lord Byron. Nebst einer Schilderung seines Aufenthaltes in Mytilene. Leipzig, 1819. In the following year there appeared at Frankfort a version by J. V. Adrian of Byron's poems and prose, wherein was included Der Blutsuger. In a collection of Byron's work the first volume of which was published at Zwickau in 1821, The Vampyre again found a place in volume V (1821), translated by Christian Karl Meifsner as Der Vampyr. The tale has also been included in various other continental collections and translations of Byron's work even until a recent date.\n\nYet it was well-known all the while that Polidori was the author of the story, but as Byron's was by far the greater name, so this sensational novella must be attributed to the cavaliero whose romantic adventures and the scandal of whose amours were thrilling the whole of Europe. Writing in the same Year as the great poet's death Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Pichot of the University of Marseilles in his Essai sur le g\u00e9nie et le caract\u00e8re de Lord Byron[35] declared that this spurious issue \"a autant contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 faire conna\u00eetre le nom de lord Byron en France, que ses po\u00ebmes les plus estim\u00e9s.\" Publishers insisted upon Le Vampire, \"nouvelle,\" being included among Byron's works, and it is said that Ladvocat was furious when it was represented to him that since it was openly acknowledged that Polidori had written The Vampire, the translation should properly be no longer given among the poet's work nor put forth under his name.\n\nAs might have been expected it was not long before the Vampire appeared upon the stage, and the first play of this kind would seem to be the famous melodrama by Charles\n\np. 291\n\nNodier (with Achille Jouffroy and Carmouche) which with music by Alexandre Piccini and scenery by Ciceri, was produced in Paris on 13th June, 1820, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte-Saint-Martin, whose directors were the popular M. M. Croznier and Merle. The r\u00f4le of Lord Rutwen was taken by M. Philippe; the celebrated Madame Dorval was Malvina;[36] and the new play had an extraordinary success.\n\nIt was immediately published as Le Vampire, m\u00e9lodrame en trois actes avec un prologue, Par M. M. . . .; Musique, de M. Alexandre Piccini; Decors de M. Ciceri. This might be purchased at 1 fr. 25cs. \"au magasin g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de pi\u00e8ces de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, Chez J.-N. Barba, Libraire, Palais Royal, derri\u00e8re le Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais, No. 51. \"The characters in the Prologue are Ituriel, ange de la Lune, Mlle. Descotte; Oscar, g\u00e9nie des Mariages, M. Mo\u00ebssard; and Un Vampire, M. Philippe. The scene opens in \"une grotte basaltique,\" the Caledonian caves of Staffa. Oscar and Ituriel discourse of Vampires, and the latter asks: \"Serait-il vrai que d'horribles fant\u00f4mes viennent quelquefois, sous l'apparence des droits de l'hymen, \u00e9gorger une vierge timide, et s'abreuver de son sang?\" This is indeed the case, and it is significant that on the morrow Malvina (Miss Aubray) is to wed \"le comte de Marsden.\" A vision of the sleeping Malvina appears when \"Un spectre v\u00eatu d'un linceuil s'\u00e9chappe de la plus apparente de ces tombes\" and rushes upon her. He is swiftly repulsed by Oscar, the good genius and the curtain falls. The characters in the play are: Lord Rutwen, M. Philippe; Sir Aubray, M. Perrin ou Th\u00e9ringy; Malvina, Mad. Dorval; Brigitte, Mad. St. Amand; Edgar, M. Edmon; Scop, M. Pierson; Petterson, M. Dugy; Lovette, Mlle. J. Vertpr\u00e9; Oscar, M. Mo\u00ebssard; with attendances of Domestiques and Villageois. The drama to a certain extent adroitly follows the lines of the Polidori novel, but with notable changes, which are well contrived and introduced. Lord Rutwen and Aubray have been fellow travellers, but the latter has no suspicion of Rutwen's real nature. In fact he holds him in the dearest affection since once he was saved from death by his friend who, whilst shielding him from a brigand's attack, fell by a chance shot. When Lord Rutwen arrives to claim Malvina's hand it is with delight Aubray hails his preserver on whom he supposed killed by the bandit's gun. It is cleverly explained how\n\np. 292\n\nthe wound did not after all prove fatal, whereupon \"Rutwen, mes desirs sont remplis\" cries Aubray, \"nous allons \u00eatre fr\u00e8res\" (Ils s'embrassent). Lovette a farmer's daughter of the Marsden estate is to wed Edgar, and Rutwen graciously presents himself at the marriage feast. As Lord of the Manor he is received with every respect and homage, but he immediately proceeds to attempt Lovette's virtue. Oscar \"un viellard dont la t\u00eate v\u00e9n\u00e9rable inspire le respect. Sa d\u00e9marche a quelque chose d'imposant et de myst\u00e9rieux,\" has already warned the maiden, and she coldly avoids such ardent importunities. Whilst Rutwen is actually pursuing the coy lass who shuns his embrace, Edgar in a fury fires a pistol at the seducer and he falls crying, \"Je meurs.\" Aubray hastening to the spot is barely in time to receive him in his arms, and with dying lips Rutwen adjures him to swear the following oath. \"Promets-moi que Malvina ne saura point ce qui m'est arriv\u00e9; que tu ne feras rien pour venger ma mort avant que la premi\u00e8re heure de la nuit n'ait sonn\u00e9. Jure-moi le secret sur ce coeur expirant.\" Aubray much moved cries, \"Je to le jure,\" and as Rutwen expires they lay the body gently on the ground. \"A`ce moment on voit la lune planer enti\u00e8rement sur le corps de Rutwen, et \u00e9clairer les gla\u00e7ons de la montagne. La toile tombe.\"\n\nAct III. \"repr\u00e9sente un grand vestibule gothique, la porte de la chapelle se voit au fond.\" Oscar solemnly utters words of warning to Brigitte, who is already full of fears which are not unnoticed by Malvina. When Aubray meets his sister she speaks joyfully of her marriage but as he is about to tell her of the fatal happening suddenly Rutwen appears and seizing his arm \"lui dit d'une voix sombre: 'Songe \u00e0 ton serment'!\" Aubray now realizes that there is some horrid secret and displays violent emotion crying out in broken tones: \"Eloigne-toi fant\u00f4me! . . ma soeur . . . d\u00e9robe-toi, aux poursuites de ce monstre . . . il te dira qu'il est ton \u00e9poux . . . refuse ton serment . . . cet hymen est un crime\" At length he is carried off by the servants who fear that he has lost his senses, an idea Rutwen encourages. In spite of this disorder the bridegroom now hotly presses on the nuptials; the great doors are opened \"et laisse voir la chapelle \u00e9clair\u00e9e,\" Rutwen and Malvina approach the altar. With a wild cry Aubray rushes in to intercept the ceremony,\n\np. 293\n\nupon which the monster drawing his dagger is about to plunge it deep into Malvina's heart when one o'clock strikes,--his power is gone.\" Il laisse tomber son poignard et cherche & s'enfuir, des ombres sortent de la terre et l'entra\u00eenent avec elles; l'Ange exterminateur para\u00eet dans un nuage, la foudre \u00e9clate et les Ombres s'engloutissent avec Rutwen. Pluie de feu. TABLEAU G\u00c9N\u00c9RAL.\"\n\nThe dialogue of this melodrama is spirited, the situations striking and well managed, and even in reading the play, one can clearly visualize that upon the stage it must have been extraordinarily effective, especially when set off with all the attractions of the scene painter's glowing perspectives, the magic craft of the subtle machinist, and the richest adornment of romantic costume.[37] Even before he had introduced the Vampire on to the boards Nodier had prophesied that this macabre monster would win a veritable triumph, and his prediction was amply fulfilled. \"Le Vampire \u00e9pouvantera, de son horrible amour, les songes de toutes les femmes, et bient\u00f4t sans doute, ce monstre encore exhum\u00e9 pr\u00eatera son masque immobile, sa voix s\u00e9pulcrale, son oeil d'un gris mort, . . . tout cet attirail de m\u00e9lodrame \u00e0 la Melpom\u00e8ne des boulevards; et quel succ\u00e8s alors ne lui est pas r\u00e9serv\u00e9!\"[38] On 1st July, 1819, writing in the Drapeau Blanc he was far more serious and far more emphatic: \"La fable du vampire est peut-\u00eatre la plus universelle de nos superstitions. . . Elle a partout l'autorit\u00e9 de la tradition: elle ne manque ni de celle de la th\u00e9ologie ni do celle de la, m\u00e9dicine. La philosophie m\u00eame en a parl\u00e9.\"\n\nAll Paris flocked to see Le Vampire, and nightly the Porte-Saint-Martin was packed to the doors. Philippe and Madame Dorval were applauded to the echo by enthusiastic audiences who recalled them again and again after the final tableau. Even the book of the play had an immense circulation and every morning Barba's counter was freshly stocked with huge piles of the duodecimo, which rapidly diminished during the day.\n\nNot a few critics, however, adopted a very uncompromising attitude, and were unsparing in their condemnation of so popular a melodrama. In Les Lettres Normandes, 1820, (tome XI, p. 93) Le Vampire was thus noticed: \"Le m\u00e9lodrame du Vampire dans lequel on voit para\u00eetre un monstre\n\np. 294\n\nqui suce le sang des petites filles et qui offre des Tableaux qu'une honn\u00eate femme ne pout voir sans rougir, est l'ouvrage de MM. Ch. Nodier, r\u00e9dacteur du Drapeau Blanc; Achille Jouffroy, r\u00e9dacteur de La Gazette et auteur des Festes de l'anarchie; et Carmouche autre r\u00e9dacteur du Drapeau Blanc.\" This censure is, however, wholly inspired by political feeling which thus inveighed against the royalist Nodier, and which not unmingled with green jealousy we also find prominent in the Conservateur litt\u00e9raire of April, 1820 (Tome II, p. 245) where we had: \"Pour balancer le succ\u00e8s du Vampire m\u00e9lodrame d\u00e9go\u00fbtant et si monstreux que les auteurs MM. Ch. Nodier et Carmouche m'ont pas os\u00e9 se faire conna\u00eetre, le th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte-Saint-Martin se pr\u00e9pare \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter la traduction litt\u00e9rale, en prose, de la Marie Stuart de Schiller.\"\n\nYet another critic is even more trenchant and severe: \"Le Vampire Ruthwen veut violer ou sucer dans les coulisses une jeune fianc\u00e9e qui fuit devant lui sur le th\u00e9\u00e2tre: cette situation est-elle morale? . . . Toute la pi\u00e8ce repr\u00e9sente indirectement Dieu comme un \u00eatre faible ou odieux qui abandonne le monde aux g\u00e9nies de l'enfer.\"[39]\n\nYet all these attacks served but to enhance the attraction, and it is remarkable for how many years this continued undiminished. In 1823 a revival of Le Vampire with Philippe and Madame Dorval again thronged the Porte-Saint-Martin to excess. Alexandre Dumas, who was present at this production has recorded how vast was his delight, how ineffable his thrills during the sombre scenes of this sepulchral melodrame. How the theatre applauded the lean livid mask of the Vampire, how it shuddered at his stealthy steps! There are, perhaps, to be found throughout the whole of the many works of Alexandre, Dumas few pages more entertaining than those chapters in his Memoires which relate with rarest humour and not a few flashes of brilliant wit his adventures at a performance of Le Vampire at the Porte-Saint-Martin in 1823. It would be difficult to find a livelier, and yet at the same time entirely serious and even critical, account of a theatrical performance. Unfortunately it is too long to give in full. In the edition of Mes M\u00e9moires, Troisi\u00e8me S\u00e9rie, Michel L\u00e9vy, Paris, 1863, it occupies no less than five chapters, LXXIII-LXXVII, and these are none of the shortest, (pp. 136-193). One is tempted to quote some delicious passages, but the\n\np. 295\n\naccount might lose thereby; it must be read as a delightful whole. Yet there is one extract which May certainly be made without impertinence, the story of the Vampire which was related to Dumas by his neighbour \"le monsieur poli qui lisait un Elz\u00e9vir.\" They have discussed the tradition at some length, and incidentally the good bibliophile refers his young acquaintance to the work of Dom Calmet, from whom he gives ample citations. He further remarks that he has resided in Illyria for three years, and he very sharply animadverts upon certain details on Nodier's melodrama which are foreign to the vampire tradition. \"You speak of vampires as though they really existed,\" remarks Dumas. \"Of course they exist,\" said his neighbour dryly. \"Have you ever seen one then?\" \"Most certainly I have.\" \"That was whilst you were in Illyria?\" \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Et vous y avez vu des vampires?\"\n\n\"Vous savez que c'est la, terre claissique des vampires, l'Illyrie, comme la Hongrie, la Servie, la Pologne.\n\n\"Non, je no sais pas . . . je ne sais rien. O\u00f9 \u00e9taient ces vampires que vous avez vus?\n\n\"A Spalatro. Je logeais chez un bonhomme de soixante-deux ans. Il mourut. Trois jours apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 enterr\u00e9, il apparut la nuit \u00e0 son fils et lui demanda \u00e0 manger; son fils le servit selon des desirs; il mangea et disparut. Le lendemain, le fils me raconta ce qui lui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9, me disant que bien certainement son p\u00e8re ne reviendrait pas pour une fois, et m'invitant a me mettre, la nuit suivante, \u00e0 une fen\u00eatre pour le voir entrer et sortir. J'\u00e9tais curieux de voir un vampire. Je me mis \u00e0 la fen\u00eatre; mais, cette nuit-la, il ne vint pas. Le fils me dit, alors, do ne pas me d\u00e9courager, qu'il viendrait probablement la nuit suivante.--La nuit suivante, je me remis donc \u00e0 ma fen\u00eatre, et, en effet, vers minuit, je reconnus parfaitement le vieillard. Il venait du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de cimeti\u00e8re; il marchait d'un bon pas; mais son pas ne faisait aucun bruit. Arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la porte, il frappa,; je comptai trois coups; les coups r\u00e9sonn\u00e8rent secs sur le ch\u00eane, comme si l'on eut frapp\u00e9 avec un os, et non avec un doigt. Le fils, vint ouvrir la porte, et le vieillard entra. . . .\n\n\"J'\u00e9coutais ce r\u00e9cit avec la plus grande attention, et je commen\u00e7ais \u00e0 pref\u00e8rer les entr'actes au m\u00e9lodrame.\n\n\"Ma curiosit\u00e9 \u00e9tait trop vivement excit\u00e9e, reprit men voisin,\n\np. 296\n\npour que je quittasse ma fen\u00eatre; j'y demeurai donc. Une demi-heure apr\u00e8s, le vieillard sortit; il retournait d'o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait venu, c'est-a-dire du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du cimetiere. A l'angle d'une muraille, il disparut. Presque au m\u00eame instant, ma porte s'ouvrit. Je me retournai vivement, c'\u00e9tait son fils. It \u00e9tait fort p\u00e2le. 'Et bien, lui dis-je, votre p\u00e8re est venu?--Oui . . . L'avez-vous vu entrer? Entrer et sortir. . . Qu'a-t-il fait aujourd'hui? Il m'a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 boire et \u00e0 manger, comme l'autre jour. Et il a bu et mang\u00e9? Il a bu et mang\u00e9 . . . Mais ce n'est pas le tout. . . voici ce qui m'inqui\u00e8te. . . Il m'a dit . . . Ah! il vous a parl\u00e9 pour autre chose que pour vous demander \u00e0, boire et a manger? . . . Oui, il m'a dit: 'Voici deux fois que je viens manger chez toi. C'est \u00e0 ton tour maintenant de venir manger chez moi.' Diable! . . . Je l'attends apr\u00e8s demain \u00e0 la m\u00eame heure. Diable! Diable! Eh! oui, justement, voil\u00e0 ce qui me tracasse.' Le surlendemain, on le trouva mort dans son lit! Ce m\u00eame jour, deux ou trois autres, personnes du m\u00eame village qui avaient vu aussi le vieillard, et qui lui avaient parl\u00e9, tomb\u00e8rent malades et moururent \u00e0 leur tour. Il fut donc reconnu que le vieillard \u00e9tait vampire. On s'informa aupr\u00e8s de moi; je racontai ce que favais vu et entendu. La justice se transporta au cimeti\u00e8re. On ouvrit les tombeaux de tous ceux qui \u00e9taient morts depuis six semaines; tous ces, cadavres \u00e9taient en d\u00e9composition. Mais, quand on en vint au tombeau de Kisilova,--c'\u00e9tait le nom du vieillard,--on le trouva les yeux ouverts, la bouche vermeille, respirant \u00e0 pleins poumons, et cependant immobile, comme mort. On lui enfon\u00e7a un pieu dans le coeur; il jeta un grand cri, et rendit le sang par le bouche; puis on le mit sur un b\u00fbcher, on le r\u00e9duisit en cendre, et l'on jeta la cendre au vent. . . . Quelque temps apr\u00e8s, je quittai le pays de sorte que je ne pus savoir si son fils \u00e9tait devenu vampire comme lui.\n\n\"Pourquoi serait-il devenu vampire comme lui? demandai-je.\n\n\"Ah! parce que c'est l'habitude, que les personnes qui meurent du vampirisme deviennent vampires.\n\n\"En v\u00e9rit\u00e9, vous dites cela comme si c'\u00e9tait un fait av\u00e9r\u00e9.\n\n\"Mais c'est qu'aussi c'est un fait av\u00e9r\u00e9, connu, enregistr\u00e9!\"\n\nIt will readily be remembered that in Monte-Cristo when\n\np. 297\n\nduring the performance of Parisina at the Teatro Argentino, Rome, the Count and Haid\u00e9e enter their box, the Countess G------ directing her opera-glass in that direction asks Franz d'Epinay who they may be remarking that as for herself, \"All I can say is that the gentleman whose history I am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up; be looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly gravedigger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of ours, than anything human. How ghastly pale he is!\" \"Oh, he is always as colourless as you now see him,\" said Franz. \"Then you know him?\" almost screamed the countess. \"Oh! pray do, for Heaven's sake, tell us all about--is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse, or what?\" A few moments later when the lady has carefully studied the loge of their mysterious vis-\u00e0-vis, Franz demands: \"Well, what do you think of our mysterious neighbour?\" \"Why, that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living frame,\" was the reply. This fresh allusion to Byron drew a smile to Franz's countenance; although he could not but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him . . . . . Is it possible,\" whispered Franz, \"that you entertain any fear?\" \"I'll tell you,\" answered the countess. \"Byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires, and even assured me he had seen some. The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us. Oh! it is the exact personification of what I have been led to expect. The coal-black hair, large bright, glittering eyes, in which a wild, unearthly fire seems burning,-the same ghastly paleness!\"[40]\n\nNearly thirty years after Dumas in collaboration with Maquet utilized the theme of Le Vampire for his own drama of the same name which was given at the Ambigu-Comique, 20th December, 1851, and which may conveniently be considered here.\n\nLe Vampire is described as a \"Drame Fantastique en Cinq Actes, en Dix Tableaux\" and there are very many characters in this remarkable play. The principal parts were taken as follows: Lord Ruthwen, M. Arnault; Gilbert de Tiffauges, M. Goujet; Juan Rozo, a Spanish inn-keeper, M. Coquet;\n\np. 298\n\nBotaro, his son-in-law, M. Curcy; Lazare, M. Laurent; Lahenn\u00e9e, M. Thierry; Jarwick, M. Lavergne; the Ghoul, Mme. Lucie Mabire; H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Tiffauges, Mile. Jane Essler; Juana, Mile. Marie Clarisse; Antonia, Mlle. Daroux; Petra, Rozo's daughter, Mile. Helo\u00efse; and the mystic fairy M\u00e9lusine, Mlle. Isabelle Constant. Lazare is a capital character, but the intrusion from Oriental legend of the ghoul cannot be considered happy. On the other hand the appearance of M\u00e9lusine, whose legend was collected about the end of the fourteenth century by Jean d'Arras, is certainly effective and entirely in keeping with the history, since according to Paracelsus she was an occult power, and in folk lore she is often represented as protecting ancient houses--in Belgium she is the guardian of the old family de Gavre,--whilst one of her four sons became King of Brittany.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to do more than give the very briefest outline of the story as Dumas tells it. The play opens with a crowded scene of merrymakers in the patio of Juan Rozo's inn. They are celebrating the nuptials of his daughter with young Botaro, and every room is occupied by his friends. and acquaintance in festive mood. Juana, who is staying at the hostlery seeks for a guide to the castle of Tormenar, which lies at some little distance, for there she is to meet Don Luis de Figuerroa, whom she will wed upon the following day. She has secretly left the convent of Annunciades, where she was a boarder, since her father has other designs for her hand, and accordingly it is necessary that she should meet her betrothed in some lonely spot. But nobody, not even the good-natured Lazare, the servant of the inn, will conduct her to the haunted castle, \"un ch\u00e2teau qui est en ruine, un ch\u00e2teau qui ne loge que des reptiles, et qui n'h\u00e9berge que des fant\u00f4mes.\" However, a numerous company, amongst whom is Gilbert de Tiffauges, arrives at the inn, and these travellers on being told that they cannot be accommodated in spite of the fact that night is falling, incontinently resolve to take up their quarters in Tormenar, so in spite of the warnings about ghosts and goblins, having once well stocked themselves with wine and food they merrily set forth, Gilbert taking charge of Juana who has confided to him her story. However, a mysterious figure, a lady, apparently of rank, who has been staying at the inn watches them as they take\n\np. 299\n\ntheir departure and mutters to herself as she fixes her gaze upon Juana: \"Il te faut deux heures pour aller retrouver ton beau fianc\u00e9. . . . Je l'aurai joint dans trois minutes!\" She is in fact the ghoul, a female vampire, and with the speed of lightning she has gone to destroy the unfortunate Don Luis.\n\nIn the second Act we see the huge Gothic hall of the old castle. A door opens and from an inner chamber the ghoul rushes out exclaiming: \"Il \u00e9tait jeune! Il \u00e9tait beau! . . . Me voil\u00e0, redevenue jeune et belle!\" The voice of Gilbert is now heard, and with the cry, \"\u00c0 l'an prochain, Gilbert.\" she disappears from sight. It will be remarked that in his treatment of the vampire tradition Dumas has adopted the legend that the vampire must year by year rejuvenate his waning forces by absorbing the life of another and sucking from another's veins fresh blood, a detail which although it may recommend itself to, and legitimately be used by, the dramatist and the writer of romances is actually inexact and but rarely to be met with, and only then in folk-lore not of the first value. The travellers, no small party, spread their provisions upon the huge tables in the old hall and laughing at the stories of ghosts and apparitions are soon in convivial mood. The conversation, however, eventually turns on the supernatural and Gilbert tells of his old home in Brittany, where one room in the castle is hung with the tapestry of the Fairy M\u00e9lusine, representing this lady and all her attendants. The story goes that if any of the family sleeps in that room she will descend from the tapestry and reveal his fortune, warning him of danger should such threaten. Another companion who has sojourned in Epirus speaks of the vampires, the women who will attack men and leave them dead and sapless; the men who will attack women to drink their blood. Just as the words are uttered Lord Ruthwen enters and announces himself as a belated traveller, who, finding no room at Rozo's inn down in the village has made his way thither,-he has even taken Lazare into his service. Presently the company disperse to their several rooms to make themselves as comfortable as may be for the night in such difficult circumstances. To his horror Gilbert discovers in the chamber he is to occupy the body of a young man, strangely pale, with a slight wound in the throat. By a letter he finds near upon the body it is plain that this can be none other\n\np. 300\n\nthan the unfortunate Don Luis. At the same moment a piercing cry is heard, and Juana ghostly pale and dying totters from her room. Gilbert rushes to her assistance just in time to see Lord Ruthwen dart out after her as she falls dead at his feet. In a moment he has drawn his sword and strikes Ruthwen to the heart, before he recognizes who it may be. In faltering accents Ruthwen explains that hearing a cry he has gone to the assistance of the lady, and with his last breath he implores Gilbert, who is well-nigh distracted at the unhappy accident, to bear his body to the hillside, where it may be bathed in the earliest rays of the new moon. This Gilbert promises, and in the final tableau we see the body of Lord Ruthwen laid upon the mountain. The moon slowly issues from the clouds, and as its silver light falls upon the corpse it seems as though the eyes opened and the mouth smiled. A moment more and the Vampire leaps to his feet re-vitalized and with fresh energy for some new demoniac enterprise.\n\nIn Act III. we find ourselves in Brittany, about a year later, at the ch\u00e2teau de Tiffauges where H\u00e9l\u00e8ne awaits her brother's return. After an affectionate greeting he confides to her the secret of his love for Antonia a lady of Spalatro in Dalmatia, and she in her turn informs him that she is about to give her hand to the Baron de Marsden. This latter proves to be none other than Lord Ruthwen, who informs Gilbert that he was sore wounded indeed at Tormenar, but that certain kindly shepherds finding him on the mountain side nursed him back to life. Moreover, he explains his change of name by informing them that his elder brother having recently died, he has succeeded to the title and estates. Visiting Tiffauges in the hope of meeting Gilbert once more, he has fallen a victim to the charms of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. The explanation is cleverly contrived, but at the same time Gilbert is hardly convinced; he feels that there is some mysterious and terrible secret lurking in the background. A happy idea strikes him. He will sleep that night in the tapestry chamber of the lady M\u00e9lusine. The scene that follows must have been extraordinarily effective upon the stage. Gilbert is slumbering, and from their places in the tapestry step forth M\u00e9lusine and her court to warn the scion of her house that danger is near. From the framed canvas and the panels descend with stately stride\n\np. 301\n\nthe old barons to tell their descendant of the horror that encompasses him, M\u00e9lusine reveals the secret.\n\n\"Prions, pour qu' \u00e0 Gilbert Dieu tout-puissant inspire Un g\u00e9n\u00e9reux effort.\nRuthwen est un d\u00e9mon, Ruthwen est un vampire; Son amour, c'est la mort!\"\n\n(One cannot but recall the famous scene in Gilbert and Sullivan's Ruddigore with its subtle admixture of beauty, fantasy and humour.)\n\nIn Act IV of Le Vampire we are shown the accomplishment of Ruthwen's designs against H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. Gilbert's frenzied warnings and denunciations are heard with alarm but with unbelief. They whisper that he is a lunatic, and when Ruthwen relates a cunning story of a mischance in Spain which temporarily unsettled Gilbert's reason, a story that seems borne out in every detail by the unhappy brother's horror and despair, the attendants for his own safety seek to restrain their young master. Ruthwen triumphs. But now the ghoul appears and bids him take heed how he seeks Gilbert's life for that is hers, and she will not likely relinquish her prey. Ruthwen defies her and the two vampires part in horrid enmity. Lazare cautions H\u00e9l\u00e8ne that her brother's story is no figment, but it is too late, the vampire seizes his victim and as midnight strikes, he destroys his hapless bride and quaffs his fill from her veins. Too late Gilbert succeeds in forcing an entrance. There is a terrific struggle, and Ruthwen is hurled from the window into the depths of a tremendous valley.\n\nIn the last act we find that in order to escape the pursuit of Ruthwen, who has extricated himself unhurt but filled with designs of even more malignant vengeance, Gilbert has transported Antonia to Circassia. Here, however, we meet the ghoul who, disguising herself under the name of Ziska, obtained admittance to the castle in the quality of an attendant upon Antonia. She informs Gilbert that she alone can save his betrothed from the vampire, and at that moment the ghastly face of Ruthwen is actually seen peering through the window. She demands that he shall relinquish Antonia's hand, and accept her love though it be to death. He refuses to betray Antonia, and at length by a supreme act of renunciation she divulges the secret whereby the Vampire may be annihilated, although this revelation must put an end to her own\n\np. 302\n\nexistence. Ziska explains how Gilbert's sword is to be blessed by a priest with a certain occult formula and if the weapon thus consecrated be driven through the Vampire's heart it will once and for all rid the world of this infernal pest. Yet as she speaks she seems to vanish in flames and they hear her last sad sigh; \"Adieu pour ce monde! Adieu pour l'autre! Adieu pour l'\u00e9ternit\u00e9\"!\n\nThe final scene is a deserted cemetery. \"Tombes, cypr\u00e8s. Fond sombre et fantastique; neige sur la terre; lune rouge au ciel.\" The Vampire lies half in and half out of his grave, grinning hideously. Gilbert is standing near. \"Pour la derni\u00e8re fois, adore Dieu!\" he adjures. \"Non,\" yells the monster. \"Alors, desesp\u00e8re et meurs\"! cries Gilbert and plunges the hallowed sword into the monster's heart. The Vampire falls back into the grave, howling fearfully, and a heavy stone closing him in fast seals him there in the womb of the earth for ever and ever. \"Au nom du Seigneur, Ruthwen, je to scelle dans cette tombe pour l'\u00e9ternit\u00e9\", et Gilbert trace sur la pierre une croix que devient lumineuse. A great aureola fills the sky and. multitudes of rejoicing angels are seen. Among them are H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Juana, smiling in happiest benison, whilst there rises from the earth the body of Ziska, radiant and beautiful, to join the glorious throng among whose immortal ranks she is enrolled by the merits of her great act of renunciation and unselfish love.\n\nThis drama of Dumas is infinitely more elaborate than the play of Nodier, but I am not altogether certain whether it is in some respects so good a work. The first two acts attain a high level; the scene in the tapestry chamber would be most picturesque upon the stage; there are several other telling situations and effective speeches, but as a whole it is too prolix, and we feel that the episode of Antonia in particular is an anti-climax. Nor, as I have remarked before, although material use is made of the character, can one consider the figure of the ghoul entirely in keeping with the rest. Had the level of the opening scenes been maintained we should possess an excellent piece of work. But without concentration and compression that was hardly possible, and here we have the secret of Nodier's success. Although he has an occasional crudity, it may be, which Dumas might not have tolerated, so swift is his action, as is essential to\n\np. 303\n\nmelodrama, so cleverly does he engage the interest of his audience, that we have no time to criticize a roughness here and there, but are rather intent to follow the next turn of the tale.\n\nImmediately upon the furore created by Nodier's Le Vampire at the Porte-Saint-Martin in 1819 vampire plays of every kind from the most luridly sensational to the most farcically ridiculous pressed on to the boards. A contemporary critic cries: \"There is not a theatre in Paris without its Vampire! At the Porte-Saint-Martin we have le Vampire; at the Vaudeville le Vampire again; at the Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s les trois Vampires ou le clair de la lune.\"\n\nJean Larat[41] further mentions a play by Paul F\u00e9val, Le fils Vampire. The version by John Wilson Ross of The Loves of Paris, a romance, published by G. Vickers, 3, Catherine Street, Strand, 1846, is said to be \"Translated from the French of Paul F\u00e9val, author of 'The Vampire,' 'The Loves of the Palais-Royal,' 'The Receipt at Midnight,' 'Stella,' 'The Son of the Devil,' etc., etc.\", but it does not appear whether \"The Vampire\" mentioned here is a play or a romance. Probably it is the latter but no such translation is known.\n\nLe Vampire which was produced at the Vaudeville, 15 June, 1820,[42] is a com\u00e9dic-vaudeville in one act by Scribe and M\u00e9lesville. The scene is laid Hungary, \"une salle d'un chateau gothique,\" and the characters are as follows: Le Comte de Valberg, feld-mar\u00e9chal, M. Guillemin; Adolphe de Valberg, son n\u00e9veu, M. Isambert; le Baron do Lourdorff, M. Fontenay; Saussmann, concierge du chateau, M. Hippolyte; Charles, valet du comte, M. Fichet; un Notaire, M. Justin; Hermance de Mansfred, Madame Rivi\u00e8re; Nancy, sa soeur, Madame Lucie; P\u00e9ters, filleul de Saussmann, Madame Minette; with attendance of domestics and wedding guests. This elegant little piece opens with nuptials of Hermance de Mansfred at the castle of the Baron de Lourdorff, to whom she is betrothed. It appears that she has something trifled with the affections of Adolphe de Valberg, now supposed dead. Her sister, Nancy, acknowledges that she loved Adolphe, but kept silence owing to his courtship of Hermance. Adolphe's uncle, the Count de Valberg, who knows nothing of the two ladies, fearing his nephew is unworthily entangled has had him held in military detention at Temesvar, whence\n\np. 304\n\nhowever he has disappeared. The intrigue of the seventeen scenes, although clearly unravelled in the play, is a little complicated, and it must suffice to relate by an accident Adolphe appears at the castle. Upon being asked his name he answers: \"Lord Ruthwen. An Englishman,\" whereupon he is immediately taken to be a Vampire and the servants are thrown into a state of panic. Eventually he is reconciled to his uncle who recognizes him as the brave young hero by whom his life was saved on a recent battlefield; Nancy's fidelity is rewarded with the hand of the man she loves, and who now realizes that Hermance's heart was never his; so that the curtain falls upon a double wedding.\n\nSeveral Pretty lyrics are interwoven with the dialogue and Nancy's first song, to the air \"De sommeiller, encor ma ch\u00e8re from Fanchon la vielleuse, is as follows:\n\nOui, ces paysans respectables\nNous rapellent le bon vieux temps:\nChez eux on croit encore au diable,\nAux vampires, au revenants;\nOn croit \u00e0 toutes les magies,\nAux amours, aux soins assidus,\nAux grands sorciers, aux grands genies . . .\nBref \u00e0 tout ce qu'on ne voit plus!\n\nLes Trois Vampires, ou le clair de, la lune[43] which was being played at the Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s is a thoroughly amusing farce in one act by Brazier, Gabriel, and Armand. It shows the adventures of a bon bourgeois, M. Gobetout, who has so distracted his brain by reading stories of Vampires and ghosts that when one night he sees in his garden three shadowy figures he is well nigh beside himself with terror as he supposes they can be no other than three vampires infesting his house. A little later he catches sight of his two daughters and their abigail who appear actually to be eating with the mysterious strangers. \"Les vampires qui soupent avec mes filles!\" he groans in accents of despair. However it proves that the supper is very material, cold chicken and a glass of good wine, whilst the rendezvous is of an amorous nature, since the visitors are two young sparks and their valet. So the play ends with a triple marriage. One remark of the worthy M. Gobetout was, it is said, nightly greeted with a hurricane of applause. He was wont to murmur in pensive accents: \"Les vampires\n\np. 305\n\nil nous viennent d'Angleterre . . . C'est encore une gentilesse de ces Messieurs . . . ils nous font de jolis cadeaux!\"\n\nAnother farce, Encore un Vampire, which when produced in 1820 at Paris, met with considerable success, was published as by Emile B. L., and yet another vampire burlesque was contributed by A. Rousseau. Les Etrennes d'un Vampire at a minor theatre was billed as from a manuscript \"trouv\u00e9 au cimiti\u00e8re de P\u00e8re-Lachaise.\"\n\nMore amusing is the work of D\u00e9saugiers who in August, 1820, gave Cadet Buteux, vampire, avec relation v\u00e9ridique du prologue et des trois actes de cet \u00e9pouvantable m\u00e9lodrame \u00e9crit sous la dict\u00e9e de ce passeux du Gros Caillou, par son secretaire, D\u00e9saugiers. When published by Rosa, 1820, this libretto bore the motto: \"Vivent les morts!\"\n\nYet another burlesque published by Martinet, 1820, is Le Vampire, m\u00e9lodrame en trois actes, paroles de Pierre de la Fosse de la rue des Morts.[44] A few verses from this vaudeville may be interesting to quote, particularly as showing the long continued popularity of Nodier's melodrama.\n\nLisant pour un sou d'politique\nPlac' Royale, sur un banc,\nJ'tombe, le tour est diabolique,\nA' point nomm\u00e9, sur l'Drapeau blanc.\n\nJ'prends un billet, non pas pour le parterre,\nCes places sont r\u00e9serv\u00e9es aux amis,\nSans l'secours de l'abb\u00e9 Saint-Pierre,\nAvec treiz sous' j'monte au paradis.\n\nAu dernier bane, paix, qu'chacun s'taise\nA' bas la gueule on crie du premier rang,\nL'rideau s'l\u00e8ve et quoique tr\u00e8s mal \u00e0 l'aise,\nLe croirez-vous, j'vois le P\u00e8re Lachaise,\nDu dernier bane.\n\nThe Vampire is described as \"d'\u00e9chapp\u00e9 de corbillard,\" One sees everywhere\n\nDes fant\u00f4ms, des revenans,\nMettant la t\u00e9te a la fen\u00eatre,\nAfin d'regarder les passans.\n\nThere was even a Polichinel Vampire which when performed at the Circus Maurice in 1822 attracted all who had a mind\n\np. 306\n\nfor a hearty laugh, and a contemporary visitor[45] to Paris merrily wrote that \"Polichinel is the very jolliest fellow in the world.\"[46]\n\nA comic operetta in one act, Le Vampire by Martin Joseph Mengals which was produced at Ghent, 1 March, 1826, deserves no more than passing mention.\n\nJames Robinson Planch\u00e9 speedily adapted Nodier's Le Vampire as The Vampire, or, The Bride of the Isles, and his version with music by Joseph Binns Hart[47] was brought out at the English Opera House, 9th August, 1820, with T. P. Cooke[48] as Ruthven, Earl of Marsden, the Vampire. Owing to his fine acting in the part, and perhaps a little to the scenic effects--the scene is laid in the Caverns of Staffa--the play was given nightly to packed houses. It is interesting to remark that for this piece the celebrated vampire trap was invented. Of this I quote the following simple description: \"A vampire trap consists of two or more flaps, usually india-rubber, through which the sprite can disappear almost instantly, where he falls into a blanket fixed to the under surface of the stage. As with the star trap, this trap is secured against accidents by placing another piece or slide, fitting close beneath when not required, and removed when the prompter's bell gives the signal to make ready.\"\n\nThe following account of the production of The Vampire is given by Planch\u00e9 in his Recollections and Reflections, Chapter III.[49] Having just spoken of an Easter piece with which he had furnished Drury Lane, Abudah, or, The Talisman of Oromanes,[50] founded upon one of the Tales of the Genii[51] and which although it had a run of nine nights Planch\u00e9 calls a very poor piece, \"miserably put on the stage,\" he continues to speak of a subsequent success, and tells us: \"A more fortunate melodrama of mine, \"The Vampire, or The Bride of the Isles,\" was produced at the Lyceum, or English Opera House, as it was then called, 9th August, 1820. Mr. Samuel James Arnold, the proprietor and manager, had placed in my hands, for adaptation, a French melodrama, entitled \"Le Vampire,\" the scene of which was laid, with the usual recklessness of French dramatists, in Scotland, where the superstition never existed. I vainly endeavoured to induce Mr. Arnold to let me change it to some place in the East of Europe. He had set his heart on Scotch music and dresses--\n\np. 307\n\nthe latter, by the way, were in stock--laughed at my scruples, assured me that the public would neither know nor care--and in those days they certainly did not--and therefore there was nothing left for me but to do my best with it. The result was most satisfactory to the management. The situations were novel and effective; the music lively and popular; the cast strong, comprising T. P. Cooke, who made a great hit in the principal character, Harley, Bartley, Pearman, Mrs. Chatterley and Miss Love. The trap now so well known as \"the Vampire trap\" was invented for this piece, and the final disappearance of the Vampire caused quite a sensation. The melodrama had a long run, was often revived, and is to this day a stock piece in the country. I had an opportunity many years afterwards, however, to treat the same subject in a manner much more satisfactory to myself, and, as it happened, in the same theatre, under the same management; but of that anon.\"\n\nThe full cast of The Vampire, or, The Bride of the Isles was originally as follows: \"In the Introductory Vision\"; Unda, Spirit of the Flood, Miss Love; Ariel, Spirit of the Air, Miss Worgman; The Vampire, Mr. T. P. Cooke; Lady Margaret, Mrs. Chatterly. \"In the Drama \": Ruthven, Earl of Marsden, the Vampire, Mr. T. P. Cooke; Ronald, Baron of the Isles, Mr. Bartley; Robert, an English Attendant on the Baron, Mr. Pearman; M'Swill, the Baron's Henchman, Mr. Harley; Andrew, Steward to Ruthven, Mr. Minton; Father Francis, Mr. Shaw; Lady Margaret, Daughter of Ronald, Mrs. Chatterly; Effie, Daughter of Andrew, Miss Carew; Bridget Lord Ronald's Housekeeper, Mrs. Grove. With regard to the costumes of which Planch\u00e9 speaks it is interesting to remark that the principal characters Ruthven and Lady Margaret are described as follows: Ruthven, Silver breast plate, studded with steel buttons; plaid kilt; philibeg; flesh arms and leggings; sandals; Scotch hat and feathers; sword and dagger. Lady Margaret, white satin dress, trimmed with plaid and silver; plaid silk sash; Scotch hat and feather. This is in the true transpontine tradition of Ossianic attire. The play is timed to take one hour and thirty minutes in representation-and Planch\u00e9 has done his work of adaptation very well, although I doubt whether his few slight departures from the original are improvements. Nevertheless he has\n\np. 308\n\ngiven the dialogue a native turn and an ease which were at this period too often lacking in similar versions from the French.\n\nIn 1825, T. P. Cooke visited Paris and appeared as Le Monstre at the Porte-Saint-Martin in Planch\u00e9's melodrama which proved a remarkable success, running for no less than eighty nights.\n\nThe Vampire or The Bride of the Isles has its place among the repertory of Hodgson's \"Juvenile Drama,\" and this in itself is an indication of no small popularity.\n\nIn The Second Maiden's Tragedy,[52] a Globe play of 1611, licensed for the stage by Sir George Buc on 31st October of that year, a macabre drama now generally attributed to Tourneur,[53] there are some remarkable scenes which culminate in something very like necrophilia, and a perverse ill-omened melancholy pervades the whole action. In Act IV the Tyrant, a usurper, ordering soldiers to attend him with \"Lanthornes and a pickax\" makes his way at midnight to the Cathedral, crying:\n\nDeath nor the marble prison my love sleeps in\nShall keep her body lockt up from mine arms.\nI must not be so cozened.\n\nA little later: \"Enter the Tirant agen at a farder dore, which opened, bringes hym to the Toombe wher the Lady lies buried; The Toombe here discouered ritchly set forthe.\" He adjures the sepulchre:\n\nThe house of silence and the Calms of rest\nAfter tempestuous life, I claim of thee\nA mistress one of the most beauteous sleepers\nThat ever lay so cold.\n\nThe vault is forced, whilst the lover soliloquizes:\n\nO the moon rises; what reflection\nIs thrown about the sanctified building,\nE'en in a twinkling, how the monuments glisten\nAs if Death's palaces were all massy silver\nAnd scorned the name of marble. Art thou cold?\nI have no faith in't, yet I believe none.\nMadam; 'tis I, sweet lady, pry'thee speak\n'Tis thy love calls on thee; thy king, thy servant.\nNo! not a word, all prisoners to pale silence\nI'll prove a kiss.\n\np. 309\n\nFirst Soldier:\n\nHere's chill venery!\n'Twould make a pandar's heels ache. I'll be sworn\nAll my teeth chatter in my head to see't.\n\nTyrant:\n\nBy th' mass, thou'rt cold indeed. Beshrew thee for't,\nUnkind to thine own blood? Hard hearted lady,\nWhat injury hast thou offered to the youth\nAnd pleasure of thy days: refuse the Court\nAnd steal to this hard lodging, was that wisdom\n.      .      .      .      Since thy life has left me\nI'll clasp the body for the spirit that dwelt in't,\nAnd love the house still for the mistress' sake.\nThou art mine now spite of destruction\nAnd Govianus; and I will possess thee.\nI once read of a Herod whose affection.\nPursued a virgin's love as I did thine,\nWho for the hate she owed him killed herself\n(As thou too rashly didst), without all pity;\nYet he preserved her body dead in honey,\nAnd kept her long after her funeral:\nBut I'll unlock the treasure house of art\nWith keys of gold and bestow all on thee\nHere slaves receive her humbly from our arms,\n.      .      .      .      So reverently\nBear her before us gently to our palace.\nPlace you the stone again where we first found it.\n\nAfter a while the scene is in the palace: \"They bringe the Body in a Chaire drest up in black veluet which setts out the pailenes of the handes and face, And a faire Chayne of pearle crosse her brest and the Crucyfex aboue it; He standes silent awhile letting the Musique play, beeknyng the soldiers that bringe her in to make obeisaunce to her, and he hym self makes a lowe honour to the body and kisses the hande. A song within in Voyces.\n\nSong:\n\nO what is Beauty that's so much adored\nA flattring glass that cozens her beholders.\nThe Night of Death makes it look pale and horrid\nThe Daynty preseru'd flesh how soone it molders\nTo loue it lyuinge it bewitchett manye\nBut after life is seldom heard of any.\"\n\nTyrant:\n\nHow pleasing art thou to us even in death\nI love thee yet, above all women living\nAnd shall do seven years hence. p. 310\nI can see nothing to be mended in thee\nBut the too constant paleness of thy cheek.\nI'd give the kingdom, but to purchase there\nThe breadth of a red Rose, in natural colour,\nAnd think it the best bargain that ever king made yet,\nBut Fate's my hinderer,\nAnd I must only rest content with Art,\nAnd that I'll have in spite on't.\n\nAccordingly an artist in painting and perfumery is summoned to adorn the face of the corpse and give it a fresh lively red colour. However this merchant of cosmetics is none other than Govianus, the rightful heir, disguised, and he fucuses the dead cheeks and lips with a peter which is confected with a strong poison, so that when the Tyrant lustfully kisses the cold flesh, he is blasted with the venom and falls in the agonies of death. The incident is extremely powerful, if extremely horrible. As the Tyrant expires Govianus taunts him thus\n\nO thou sacrilegious villain,\nThou thief of rest, robber of monuments,\nCannot the body after funeral\nSleep in the grave for thee? Must it be raised?\nOnly to please the wickedness of thine eye?\nDoes all things end with death and not thy lust?\nHast thou devised a new way to damnation,\nMore dreadful than the soul of any sin\nDid ever pass yet between earth and hell?\n\nA very large number of plays are founded upon what may be termed the \"Romeo and Juliet\" motive, the awakening, or the restoration to life in some sort, of a loved one supposed dead, arousing from a trance, it may be, or a coma, a theme admitting almost innumerable variants. In the Italian, French and German theatres alone--nor does this rough list pretend to be exhaustive--we have Sforza d' Oddi's Imorti vivi (1576); Pagnini's Imorti vivi (1600); Rota's La morta viva (1674); Douville's Les morts vivans (1654); Quinault's Le fant\u00f4me amoureux (1659); Boursault's Le Mort vivant (1662); Sedaine's Der Tote ein Freyer (1778); Kurl\u00e4nder's Der tote Neffe; Friedrich Rambach's Der Scheintote; Leopold Huber's Der Scheintote; Theodore Friedrich's Die Scheintoten; F. L. W. Meyer's Der Verstorbene; G. Lebrun's Die Verstorbenen; Tenelli's Der Verstorbene; Holbein's \"romantisches Gem\u00e4lde\" Der Verstorbene; Paers' opera Die lebenden Toten; and a ballet\n\np. 311\n\n(1803) Der lebendige Tote; cum multis aliis quae nunc perscribere longum est.\n\nIt may be convenient here briefly to review the progress of the Vampire in the theatre, at least in his most important appearances.\n\nAn Italian opera, I vampiri, the work of the much applauded Neapolitian composer Silvestro di Palma, which was performed at the Teatro San Carlo[54] in 1800 did not of course take anything from the novel by Polidori which indeed, it preceded by nearly twenty years. but was rather inspired by the famous treatise of Guiseppe Davanzati: Dissertazione sopra i Vampiri di Gioseppe Davanzati Patrizio Fiorentino e Tranese, Cavaliere Gerosolimitano, Arcivescovo di Trani, e Patriarca d'Alessandria. (Seconda edizione.) Nalopi. M.D.CC.LXXXIX. Presso Filippo Raimondi. Con licenzi de' Superiori.\n\nOn 28th March, 1828,[65] at Leipzig, was produced an opera, \"Grosse romantische Oper,\" Der Vampyr, founded on the original French melodrama, the scene being changed from Scotland to Hungary. The libretto is by Wilhelm August Wohlbr\u00fcck and the music by his yet more famous brother-in-law Heinrich August Marschner. Der Vampyr was an enormous success. A free adaptation of this being made by J. R. Planch\u00e9, and produced at the Lyceum, 25th August, 1829, it ran for sixty nights. In his Recollections and Reflections which have before been quoted, Planch\u00e9 commences Chapter X by some account of this. \"In the summer of 1829 I had the opportunity of treating the subject of 'The Vampire' in accordance with my own ideas of propriety. The French melodrama had been converted into an opera for the German stage, and the music composed by Marschner.\n\n\"Mr. Hawes, who had obtained a score of it, having induced Mr. Arnold to produce it at the Lyceum, I was engaged to write the libretto, and consequently laid the scene of action in Hungary, where the superstition exists to this day, substituted for a Scotch chieftain a Wallachian Boyard, and in many other respects improved upon my earlier version. The opera was extremely well sung, and the costumes novel as well as correct, thanks to the kindness of Dr. Walsh, the traveller,[66] who gave me some valuable information respecting the national dresses of the Magyars and the Wallachians.\n\np. 312\n\n\"I am surprised that Marschner's most dramatic and melodious works, 'Der Vampyr,' 'Die Judin,' &c., have not been introduced to our more advanced musical audiences at one or other of our great operatic establishments.\n\n\"The production of 'Der Vampyr' was followed by that of 'The Brigand' at Drury Lane.\"\n\nPolidori's tale formed the basis of a romantic opera in three acts, the libretto of which was from the pen of C. M. Heigel, and the music by p. von Lindpaintner. This was seen at Stuttgart on 2 Ist September, 1828, and it proved a remarkable success. It was announced as being from \"Byron's famous tale,\" although at this date such an attribution can hardly have deceived any.\n\nOn 25th May, 1857, there was produced in Berlin a \"Komischen Zauber-Ballet Morgano\" by Paul Taglioni with music by J. Hertzel. The scene is laid in Hungary during the seventeenth century, and in the sixth tableau Elsa dances an infernal lavolta with the vampires in their haunted castle, but she is rescued by her lover, Retzka, who slays the vampire Morgano with a consecrated poniard. In 1861 at Milan appeared a ballet by Rotta, Il vampiro, with music by Paolo Giorza. Guten Abend Herr Fischer! oder, Der Vampyr is a light vaudeville in one act by G. Belly and G. L\u00f6ffler, with music by W. Telle, which had some success in its day. Ein Vampyr by Ulrich Franks (Ulla Wolf) given at Vienna in 1877 is a farce taken from Scribe.\n\nIn England Dion Boucicault's[57] The Vampire, in three acts was produced at the Princess's Theatre, London, 19th June, 1852, when the author made his first appearance before a metropolitan audience. Of this drama the following criticism, if criticism it may be called, was given by Henry Morley in his \"Journal of a London Playgoer.\" It must be remembered that Morley continually shows himself extremely prejudiced and his censure must not be taken any more seriously than we regard the ill-word of many critics to-day, for example, the shrill petulant piping and the childish miffs of St. John Ervine in the sullens. Under 19th June Morley writes: \"If there be any truth in the old adage, that 'when things are at the worst they must mend,' the bettering of Spectral Melodrama is not distant; for it has reached the extreme point of inanity in the new piece which was produced on\n\np. 313\n\nMonday at the Princess's Theatre, under the attractive title of The Vampire.\n\n\"Its plot is chiefly copied from a piece which some years ago turned the Lyceum into a Chamber of Horrors; but it has been spun out into three parts, facetiously described as 'Three Dramas': the little period of a century has been interposed between each part; and, in order that the outrage on the possible shall be complete, the third part is projected forward into the year that will be 1860! By this ingenious arrangement, the resuscitation of the original Vampire has been enabled to supply the lovers of the revolting at the Princess's with three acts of murder--that is, two consumated, and one attempted; but, as the delicate process of vampirical killing is exactly after the same pattern in each case, the horror is quite worn out before the career of the creature terminates. Nothing but tedious trash remains.\n\n\"To 'an honest ghost' one has no objection; but an animated corpse which goes about in Christian attire, and although never known to eat, or drink, or shake hands, is allowed to sit at good men's feasts; which renews its odious life every hundred years by sucking a young lady's blood, after fascinating her by motions which resemble mesmerism burlesqued; and which, notwithstanding its well-purchased longevity, is capable of being killed during its term in order that it may be revived by moonbeams--such a ghost as this passes all bounds of toleration.\n\n\"The monster of absurdity was personated by its reviver Mr. Boucicault, with due paleness of visage, stealthiness of pace, and solemnity of tone; the scenery, especially a moonlit ridge amidst the heights of Snowdon, was beautiful, and the costumes were prettily diversified; but the dreary repetition of fantastical horror almost exhausted even the patience which a benefit enjoins. Unfortunately, the mischief of such a piece, produced at a respectable theatre, does not end with the weariness of the spectators, who come to shudder and remain to yawn; for it is not only 'beside the purpose of playing,' but directly contravenes it; and though it may be too dull to pervert the tastes of those who witness its vapid extravagances, it has power to bring discredit on the most genial of arts.\"\n\nIt may be pointed out that this account, probably through ignorance, possibly of intent, is deliberately inaccurate. p. 314 Although confessedly a poorer play than Planch\u00e9's The Vampire Dion Boucicault's drama is not derived from the earlier piece, but both are taken from the same source, Polidori's romance. Seeing that Henry Morley was Emeritus Professor of English Literature in University College, London, it were reasonable to suppose that he should have been acquainted with Polidori's novella. Or perhaps I rather ought to say that therefor it was not to be expected he should have known of this famous work.\n\nBoucicault afterwards revived The Vampire as The Phantom, and this was given in London with good applause. The American cast of the characters of The Phantom, \"As Produced at Wallack's Theatre, New York City,\" is as follows: In Act I (1645), The Phantom, Dion Boucicault; Lord Albert Clavering, Mr. J. B. Howe; Sir Hugh Neville of Graystock, Mr. Ralton; Sir Guy Musgrave, Mr. Etynge; Ralph Gwynne, Mr. Levere; Davy, Mr. T. B. Johnstone; Lucy Peveryl, Miss Agnes Robertson; Ellen, Miss Alleyne; Maud, Miss Ada Clare; Janet, Mrs. H. P. Grattan. In Act II (1750), Alan Raby, Dion Boucicault; Colonel Raby, Mr. Ralton; Edgar, his nephew, Mr. J. B. Howe; Dr. Rees, Mr. Burnett; Curate, Mr. Paul; Corporal Stump, Mr. Peters; Ada Raby, Miss Agnes Robertson; Jenny, Mrs. L. H. Allen.\n\nSubsequently, I presume when The Phantom was given in London, some modifications were made which seem to me most decidedly to be improvements. The first act was placed in the latter part of the reign of Charles II, and two hundred years were supposed to elapse between the first and the second acts. This necessitated trifling changes in the dialogue at certain points; and naturally a complete alteration of costume to a modern style for Act II. In fact the script of the play which is printed in Dicks' Standard Plays, No. 697, (c. 1887) under \"Costume\" gives the following direction\": \"The costumes in the First Act are of the period of the latter part of the reign of Charles the Second. In the Second Art the respective characters are dressed in the provincial costume of Wales at the middle of the present century, The following description of Alan Raby's costume for each act will show the necessity of a complete change in the style of dress which this drama requires.\n\nAlan Raby.--First Act: A Puritan's suit of black serge, bound with black velvet---cloak and breeches to match-black\n\np. 315\n\nbelt and buckle-black gauntlets---shirt collar thrown back so as to show the throat bare-black stockings-black velvet shoes with strap across the instep--black sugar-loaf hat and broad riband and steel buckle--phosphoric livid countenance--slightly bald head--long black lank hair combed behind the ears--bushy black eyebrows and heavy black moustache. 2nd dress: Black dress coat and overcoat of the same colour--black trousers--black waistcoat--black kid gloves, white wristbands over them--white cravat and black German hat--all modern, and such as would be worn by a gentleman at the present time.\" In the theatre such a contrast would have proved very effective.\n\nI notice that Boucicault has in certain scenes borrowed his situations pretty freely from Le Vampire of Dumas, and occasionally he has even conveyed actual dialogue from the French play.\n\nAt the commencement of The Phantom we are shown a room in a Welsh inn, and it appears that Davy and Janet the hostess have just been married. A sudden storm sends Lucy Peveryl thither for shelter, and she confides to Janet that she is on her way to meet at sundown her cousin Roland Peveryl, who is a fugitive and proscribed. On this account he dare not openly seek her hand, but the lovers are secretly betrothed. He has promised to meet her, in order to bid her farewell for a time, in the most unfrequented spot, the ruins of Raby Castle. No sooner does Janet hear that name than she cries out with horror, and speaks of a fearful story connected with the place. They are interrupted by the arrival of Lord Clavering with a party of guests, amongst whom are friends of Lucy. She frankly informs them of her rendezvous, and they decide to accompany her, more especially as the inn has not sufficient accommodation for the travellers, who resolve to take provisions and wine and spend the night in the deserted chambers of the old castle. Davy endeavours to prevent them, nor are his efforts altogether selfish. He tells them: \"No one ever sought a night's shelter in the ruins of Raby Castle, that ever lived to see the morning. . . . Within the ruins of Raby dwells some terrible thing--man or fiend! . . . No traveller that knows the road will ever venture near that spot after nightfall; but strange wayfarers, benighted in the storm have wandered to this place of shelter, and the next morning they are found--dead--each with a wound in his throat in the right side, from which they\n\np. 316\n\nhave evidently bled to death;--but no blood is spilt around, the face is white and fixed, as if it had died of horror.\" \"And he, my betrothed,\" cries Lucy, \"Roland is there.\" Nevertheless the company laugh at these old stories and determine to make their way to the old castle. This they actually find in far better state than they have been led to expect, and their servants who have insisted upon Davy showing them the way soon get a very fair supper from the provisions they have purchased at his inn. Roland Peveryl is not to be found, but whilst they are eating a stranger enters, a Puritan, and announces himself as Gervase Rookwood, a traveller who has lost his way in the mountains. Davy, however, almost collapses with terror. He recollects that many years before the castle belonged to Sir Owen Raby, a noble cavalier, while Alan Raby, his younger brother had joined the forces of Cromwell. Taking advantage of this difference the traitor one midnight with a band of Puritan soldiers surprises the castle, and butchers the sleeping garrison, killing his brother with his own hand. About a year later, however, the tables are turned, the Royalists recapture the place, Alan Raby is seized, and in their rage they hurl the fratricide from a window which hung shudderingly over a fearful precipice. Curiously enough no trace of the body could ever be recovered. But Davy recognizes that Gervase Rookwood is none other than Alan Raby. Here we have the old belief that a man guilty of some, monstrous crime, in this case rebellion against the King and the murder of a brother, is compelled to return as a vampire. When the company disperse to their various apartments for the night Lord Clavering is horrified to discover in his room the dead body of young Roland Peveryl, \"a wound deep in his throat, but bloodless.\" At the same moment a piercing scream is heard and Lucy Peveryl rushing from her chamber with her hands wildly clasping her neck falls dead in Lord Clavering's arms. Seeing as he thinks a shadowy form that steals from her room he draws a pistol and fires. When the company hurry in with lights they discover Alan Raby has been shot. In faltering accents the dying man explains that hearing a cry for help he hastened to the lady's assistance. He will only forgive Lord Clavering on one condition. \"When I have breathed my last, let my body be conveyed amongst the peaks of Snowdon, and there exposed to the first rays of the rising\n\np. 317\n\nmoon which touch the earth.\" This is done, and the first act concludes with a tableau of the peaks of Snowdon, whilst from behind the clouds there sails high in the heaven a silver sickle that strikes the corpse with her argent shaft of mystic light. The vampire wakes, and leaps to his feet crying in exultant tones: \"Fountain of my life: once more thy rays restore me. Death! I defy thee!\"\n\nIt cannot escape notice that in this act there are many parallels with Le Vampire of Dumas. Raby Castle is the Castle of Tormenar; Lucy Peveryl is Juana; Roland Peveryl, Don Luis de Figuerroa; Lord Clavering, Gilbert de Tiffauges; and Davy the gracioso Lazare.\n\nTwo centuries have flown. Raby Castle is now inhabited in possession of Colonel Raby, whose daughter is betrothed to her cousin Edgar. It has been falsely reported that this latter fell in battle, but the scene opens with his return. When the sad news first arrived Ada Raby was stricken almost to death, and, as they believed, actually died; but she was recalled to life by a mysterious stranger, since which hour she seems to, have fallen completely under his influence and in some extraordinary way only to respond to his power. This is none other than Gervase Rookwood, who now appears and informs Colonel Raby that he and none other is the lawful lord of Raby Castle. The Colonel's claim lies in the fact that when years before the last of the old Raby family, Sir Alan Raby died, or rather was killed, and no will could be found, the estate reverted to a distant branch of the Rabys, now represented by the Colonel. However, a document is produced in the handwriting of Alan Raby, his will, wherein he bequeaths the estate to Gervase Rookwood and the Rookwood successors. It seemed as though such a title cannot be resisted, but Doctor Rees, a scholar of occultism, is filled with the gravest suspicions of the stranger. In a \"Dictionary of Necromancy, a rare work by Dr. Dee,\" he has read of vampires, and he divines the demoniac nature of the pretended Rookwood. In a trancelike state Ada Raby has rejected Edgar and is to be given to the stranger, when Dr. Rees examining the documents discovers that the will of Sir Alan Raby, which must be some two hundred years old, although the hand is doubtless that of Raby as the archives prove, is written upon paper which has a watermark of 1850, \"scarcely five years old.\" The vampire who\n\np. 318\n\nendeavours to assassinate Edgar, is killed by a charmed bullet. Whilst his limbs relax in death the hypnotic spell vanishes from Ada's mind and she is united to her lover. But to their horror they notice that as the moonlight touches the body of Alan Raby where he has fallen, his members begin to twitch anew with life. Dr. Rees seizes the vampire and hurls the body into the darkest chasm of the mountain side, where no beam nor ray can ever penetrate or find the smallest chink of entrance.\n\nThe Phantom is, of course, somewhat old-fashioned and a little stilted, as was the mode, in its diction. No doubt some of the situations could be revised and far more neatly turned, yet on the whole I conceive that it should prove of its kind excellent fare in the theatre, and some scenes, at least, in capable hands were not without emotional appeal, I had almost said a certain impressiveness. Far worse dramas have (not undeservedly) earned their meed of approbation and applause.\n\nOn 15th August, 1872, was advertised: \"Royal Strand Theatre. Production of a Bit of Moonshine in Three Rays, entitled 'The Vampire,' written by R. Reece.\" There was indeed a bounteous bill of fare. At seven was given a farce, The Married Bachelor; at 7.30 Byron's Not Such a Fool as He Looks; \"At Half Past Nine the new and original Burlesque, a little Bit of Moonshine in Three Rays, called The Vampire, written by R. Reece. The new Music by John Fitzgerald, the New Scenery Painted by H. P. Hall; Dresses by May, Mrs. Richardson and Assistants; Machinery by Wood; Properties by Ball. The Piece produced under the direction of Mrs. Swanborough, Mr. J. Wallace, and Mr. Reece.\" The house, says the Era, 18th August, 1872, was crowded for this \"satirical burlesque.\" His play, the author wrote, was founded upon \"a German legend, Lord Byron's story, and a Boucicaultian drama.\" The Vampire, according to Reece, is a plagiarist who lives on other people's brains. The title r\u00f4le was acted by Edward Terry who kept the audience in roars of laughter. \"Mr. Terry's make-up as the Vampire was something extraordinary, and he worked with unflagging energy to add 'go' to the novelty.\" During a picnic in the ruins of Raby Castle the Vampire endeavours to steal the note books of Ada Raby (Miss Emily Pitt) and Lady Audley Moonstone (Mrs. Raymond) two lady novelists, so that he may utilize their efforts for his weekly instalment of the \"penny dreadful\" and other fiction.\n\np. 319\n\nHe is attacked by the two lovers of the ladies, Lord Albert Clavering (Miss Bella Goodall) and Edgar (Miss Topsy Venn), and a good deal of broadest farce follows. \"The author was cordially greeted upon his appearance before the curtain, and the latest Strand burlesque may be noted as an undoubted success.\" The Illustrated London News, 24th August, 1872, although very justly doubting the propriety of the subject as a theme for travesty highly praised Edward. Terry \"as the Hibernian plagiarist with the broadest of brogues and the most ghastly of faces.\" As Allan Raby he haunts the ruins of Raby Castle, Raby Hall, and the Peak of Snowdon, seeking to filch the notebooks of tourists, \"from which he may gather materials for a three-volume novel which he has been engaged by a publisher to compose.\"\n\nOn Monday, 27th September, 1909, at the Paragon Theatre was produced The Vampire, a \"two-scene sketch,\" adapted by Mr. Jos\u00e9 G. Levy from the French of Mme. C. le Vylars and Pierre Souvestre. \"It is a capitally written little piece conceived. in the grand Guignol vein;\" The Stage, 30th September, 1909. The first scene is Harry le Strang's smoking-room. Harry has been infatuated with a demi-mondaine named Sonia, who shot herself in a fit of remorse. The despairing lover is in communication with a Hindoo spiritualist Seratsih, who has evoked the spirit of the dead woman, now become a vampire and preying upon Harry's vitality and reason. An old friend, Jack Harlinger, in order as he thinks to save the situation persuades his own fianc\u00e9e, Olga Kay, to personate the ghost of Sonia. The result is swift tragedy, for the maddened Harry le Strang shoots her dead destroying the vampire, whilst he himself falls at the revolver of Jack Harlingen Harry le Strang was played by Charles Hanbury; Jack Harlinger, Lauderdale Maitland; Seratsih, Clinton Barrett; and Olga Kay, Janet Alexander. The piece was very well received.\n\nThe Vampire, a Tragedy in Five Acts, by St. John Dorset (the Rev. Hugo John Belfour), Second Edition, 1821,[60] does not appear to have been acted. It was dedicated to W. G. Macready, Esq., whose kindness the author acknowledges in most grateful terms. The story is Oriental, the same being laid in Alexandria, and it is a \"moral\" vampire that is shown by the poet. In his \"advertisement\" he quotes a passage\n\np. 320\n\nfrom the Examiner, when noticing Planch\u00e9's melodrama wrote: \"There are Vampires who waste the heart and happiness of those they are connected with, Vampires of avarice, Vampires of spleen, Vampires of debauchery, Vampires in all the shapes of selfishness and domestic tyranny.\" This is his theme, and although his pages have considerable merit I do not conceive that his scenes would have been entirely successful on the stage, since they are poetical and reflective rather than dramatic,\n\nIn Germany sensational fiction was long largely influenced by Polidori, and we have such romances as Zschokke's Der tote Gast, Spindler's Der Vampyr und seine Braut, Theodor Hildebrand's Der Vampyr, oder die Totenbraut. Edwin Bauer's roman \u00e0 clef the clever Der Baron Vampyr,\" which was published at Leipzig in 1846, hardly concerns as here, whilst Ewald August K\u00f6nig's sensational Ein moderner Vampyr,[62] which appeared in 1883, or Franz Hirsch's Moderne Vampyr,[63] 1873, productions which only use in their titles the word \"Vampire\" to attract,--one might say, to ensnare attention, are in this connexion no more deserving of consideration than mere chap-books and pedlar's penny-ware such as Morelli's Der Vampyr, and Dr. Seltzam's pornographic Die Vampyre der Residenz.\n\nUndoubtedly the vampire tradition has never been treated with such consummate skill as by Th\u00e9ophile Gautier in his exquisite prose poem La Morte Amoureuse, which first appeared in the Chronique de Paris on 23rd and 26th June, 1836, when the young author was not quite twenty-five. Although the theme is not original yet perhaps nowhere beside has it been so ingeniously moulded with such delicacy of style, with such rich and vivid colouring, with such emotion and such repression. The darker shadows of the tradition are suggested rather than portrayed, yet none can deny that there is an atmosphere of sombre mystery, even a touch of morbid horror which with complete artistry the writer allows us to suspect rather than to comprehend. The very vagueness of the relation adds to the illusion. We hardly know whether Romuald is the young country priest occupied in prayer and good works, or whether he is the Renaissance seignior living a life of passion and hot extravagance. As he himself cries: \"Sometimes I thought I was a priest who dreamed every night that be was a nobleman, sometimes that I was a nobleman who dreamed that he was a\n\np. 321\n\npriest. I could no longer distinguish dreams from real life; I did not know where reality began and illusion ended. The dissolute, supercilious young lord jeered at the priest, and the priest abhorred the dissipations of the young lord.\" But were he humble priest, or were he profligate patrician, one emotion remained eternally the same, his love for Clarimonde. At length the Abb\u00e9 Serapion dissolves the glamour. Sternly he bids young Romuald accompany him to the deserted cemetery where Clarimonde lies buried; he exhumes the body, and as he sprinkles it with holy water it crumbles into dust. Then also has the lord Romuald gone for ever. There only remains the poor priest of God broken and alone, who grows old in an obscure parish in the depths of a wood, and who well-nigh half a century after scarcely dares to stir the ashes of that memory.\n\nThere are in English not a few stories which deal with the vampire tradition, and many of these are well imagined and cleverly contrived; the morbid horror of the thing has often been conveyed with considerable power, but yet it will, I think, be universally allowed that no author has written pages comparable to this story of Gautier. It is hardly to be disputed that the best of the English vampire stories is Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla, which the authorities upon the bibliography of this author[64] have not traced further back than its appearance in the collection entitled In A Glass Darkly, 1872,[65] Carmilla which is a story of some length, containing sixteen chapters, is exceedingly well told and it certainly exhibits that note of haunting dread which is peculiar to Le Fanu's work. The castle in Styria and the family who inhabit it are excellently done, nor will the arrival of Carmilla and the mysterious coach wherein sat \"a hideous black woman, with a sort of coloured turban on her head, who was gazing all the time from the carriage window, nodding and grinning derisively towards the ladies, with gleaming eyes and large white eyeballs, and her teeth set as if in fury,\" easily be forgotten.\n\nIt must suffice to mention very briefly but a few short stories in English where the vampire element is present. E. F. Benson has evoked real horror in his The Boom in the Tower and the horrible creature tangled in her rotting shroud all foul with mould and damp who returns from her accursed grave is loathly to the last degree.\n\np. 322\n\nThe Flowering of the Strange Orchid, by H. G. Wells, introduces a botanical vampire. An orchid collector is found dead in a jungle in the Andaman Islands, with a strange bulb lying near him. This is brought to England and carefully tended by a botanist until it comes to flower. But when at last the blossoms burst open great tendrils suddenly reach out to grasp the man sucking his blood with hideous gusts. The unfortunate wretch has to be violently torn away from the plant which drips with blood scare e in time to save his life.\n\nThis idea closely resembles Fred M. White's story, The Purple Terror, which appeared in the Strand Magazine, September, 1899, Vol. xviii, No. 105. Here Lieutenant Will Scarlett, an American officer and a number of his men have to make their way across a certain tract of Cuban Territory. Spending the night in a country posada they are attracted by a pretty dancing girl who is wearing twined round her shoulders a garland of purple orchids larger than any known variety. The blossoms which a blood-red centre exhale a strange exotic perfume. Scarlett is fired with the enthusiasm of giving a new orchid to the horticultural world, and on the following morning a native, named Tito, undertakes to guide him to the spot. He learns that the natives call them \"the devil's poppies\" and that the flowers grow in the high trees where their blossoms cling to long green tendrils. As night falls the little company arrives at a plateau ringed by tall trees whose branches are crowned with great wreaths of the purple flower nestling amid coils of long green ropery. To their alarm they note that the ground is covered with bleaching bones, the skeletons of men, animals, and birds alike. Yet perforce they must camp there rather than risk the miasma of the lower valley. Scarlett keeps watch. In the darkness there is a rustling sound and suddenly a long green tendril furnished at the end with a sucker armed with sharp spines like teeth descends and snatches one of the men from the ground. As it is about to withdraw Scarlett with inconceivable swiftness slashes it through with his knife. But the man's clothing has even in that moment been cut through by the razor spines and his body is marked by a number of punctures where his blood is oozing in great drops. Immediately half-a-dozen and more lithe living cords with fanged mouths fall groping for their prey. The men are hurriedly awakened and with\n\np. 323\n\ndifficulty they extricate themselves by sending their whingers, ripping and tearing in every direction. It appears that the vampire poppies at night send down these tendrils to gather moisture. Anything which the fearful suckers can catch they drain dry, be it man or beast or bird. Lieutenant Scarlett and his men have been deliberately led into this trap by Tito, who is madly jealous of their compliments to Zara, the dancing-girl. They hold him prisoner and threaten him with condign punishment at headquarters.\n\nAlgernon Blackwood brings together two types of vampires in his story The Transfer. One is a human being, the psychic sponge, who absorbs and seems to live upon the vitality of others. He is thus described by the governess: \"I watched his hard, bleak face; I noticed how thin he was, and the curious oily brightness of his steady eyes. And everything he said or did announced what I may dare to call the suction of his presence.\" There is also a yet more horrible monster, if one may term it so, the Forbidden Corner, an arid barren spot in the midst of the rose garden, naked and bald amid luxuriant growth. A child who knows its evil secret says: \"It's bad. It's hungry. It's dying because it can't get the food it wants. But I know what would make it feel right.\" When the human vampire ventures near this spot it exerts its secret strength and draws him to itself. He falls into the middle of the patch and it drinks his energy. He lives on, but he seems to be nothing more than a physical husk or shell without vitality. As for the Forbidden Corner \"it lay untouched, full of great, luscious, driving weeds and creepers, very strong, full fed and bursting thick with life.\"\n\nSir Arthur Conan Doyle in his little story, The Parasite, has depicted a human vampire or psychic sponge in the person of Miss Penelosa, who is described as being a small frail creature, \"with a pale peaky face, an insignificant presence and retiring manner.\" Nevertheless she is able to obsess Professor Gilroy who says: \"She has a parasite soul, yes, she is a parasite; a monster parasite. She creeps into my form as the hermit crab creeps into the whelk's shell.\" To his horror he realizes that under her influence his will becomes weaker and weaker and he is bound to seek her presence. He resists for a while, but the force becomes so overmastering that he is compelled to yield, loathing himself as he does so. When he visits her,\n\np. 324\n\nwith a terrific effort he breaks the spell and denounces her unhallowed fascination in burning words. However, his victory is short indeed. She persecutes him most bitterly, and when he unburdens his troubles to his college professor the only result is a prescription of chloral and bromide, which promptly goes into the gutter. With devilish craft the vampire destroys his reputation as a scholar, and brings about ill-natured gossip and comment. She is able to confuse his brain during his lectures, so that he talks unintelligible nonsense and his classes become the laughing-stock of the university, until at length the authorities are obliged to suspend him from his position. Almost in despair he cries: \"And the most dreadful part of it all is my loneliness. Here I sit in a commonplace English bow-window looking out upon a common-place English street, with its garish buses and its lounging policemen, and behind me there hangs a shadow which is out of all keeping with the age and place. In the home of knowledge I am weighed down and tortured by a power of which science knows nothing. No magistrate would listen to me. No paper would discuss my case. No doctor would believe my symptoms. My own most intimate friends would only look upon it as a sign of brain derangement. I am out of all touch with my kind.\"\n\nThe unfortunate victim is driven even deeper still by this unhallowed influence, which causes him to rob a bank, violently assault a friend, and finally to come within an ace of mutilating the features of his betrothed. At length the persecution ceases with the sudden death of the vampire, Miss Penelosa.\n\nThe True Story of a Vampire is a pathetic little story, very exquisitely told, in Studies of Death, by Stanislaus Eric, Count Stenbock, who wrote some verses of extraordinary charm in Love, Sleep, and Dreams; Myrtle, Rue, and Cypress; The Shadow of Death; and who at least once in The Other Side told a macabre legend with most powerful and haunting effect. A mysterious Count Vardaleh visits the remote styrian castle of old Baron Wronski, and before long attains an occult influence over the boy heir, Gabriel. The lad wastes away, and Count Vardaleh is heard to murmur: \"My darling, I fain would spare thee; but thy life is my life, and I must live, I who would rather die. Will God not have any mercy on me? Oh, oh! life; oh, the torture of life! . . . O Gabriel, my beloved! My life, yes, life--oh, my life? I am sure this is\n\np. 325\n\nbut a little I demand of thee. Surely the superabundance of life can spare a little to one who is already dead.\" As the boy lies wan and ill, the Count enters the room and presses a long feverish kiss upon his lips. Vardaleh rushes forth, and can never be traced again. Gabriel has expired in the agony of that embrace.\n\nIn a novel, The Vampire, by Reginald Hodder, a woman who is the leader of an occult society is forced to exercise her powers as a vampire to prevent the ebbing of her vitality. Here her ravages are psychic rather than physical, albeit in fact the two so closely commingled that they are not to be separated. A curious feature in the tale is that this woman is represented as putting forth her energies through the medium of a metallic talisman, and various struggles to gain possession of the object form the theme of the story. It falls into the hands of persons who would employ it for evil purposes, when it constitutes a very formidable menace, but at the last after a number of extraordinary happenings it is happily recovered.\n\nThe traditional, but yet more horrible vampire is presented to us by F. Marion Crawford in For the Blood Is the Life. Here a young man, who has been loved by a girl whose affection he was unable to return, is after her death vampirised by her, and when his friends suspect the truth they determine to rescue him. They find him upon her grave, a thin stream of blood trickling from his throat. \"And the flickering light of the lantern played upon another face that looked up from the feast,--upon two deep, dead eyes that saw in spite of death--upon parted lips redder than life itself--upon gleaming teeth on which glistened a rosy drop.\" The situation is effectively dealt with according to the good old tradition. A hawthorn stake is driven through the heart of the vampire who emits a quantity of blood and with a despairing shriek dies the last death.\n\nAlmost equally vivid in its details must be accounted the tale, Four Wooden Stakes, by Victor Roman. The ghastly events in the lonely old house with its little grey crypt, some ten miles from the small town of Charing, a place of not more than fifteen hundred souls, are most vividly described. There lived the Holroyds, the grandfather, the father, and three brothers. Whilst in South America the grandfather \"was\n\np. 326\n\nattacked while asleep by one of those huge bats. Next morning he was so weak be couldn't walk. That awful thing had sucked his life blood away. He arrived here, but was sickly until his death, a few weeks later.\" So says Remson Holroyd, who is left the sole survivor of the family, and who has summoned his old college friend to help him solve the secret of the hideous doom which is taking toll one by one. The grandfather was not buried in the usual way; but, as his will directed, his remains were interred in the vault built near the house. Remson Holroyd continues: \"Then my dad began failing and just pined away until he died. What puzzled the doctors was the fact that right up until the end he consumed enough food to sustain three men, yet he was so weak he lacked the strength to drag his legs over the floor. He was buried, or rather interred with grand-dad. The same symptoms were in evidence in the cases of George and Fred. They are both lying in the vault. And now, Jack, I'm going, too, for of late my appetite has increased to alarming proportions, yet I am as weak as a kitten.\" The next morning the visitor finds himself so weak that he is hardly able to rise and he feels a slight pain in the neck. \"I rushed to examine it in the mirror. Two tiny dots rimmed with blood--my blood--and on my neck! No longer did I chuckle at Remson's fears, for it, the thing, had attacked me--as I slept.\" The host himself is in a state of utter exhaustion. That night watch is kept by the friend, and as from his concealment he is gazing into Remson's room he notices \"a faint reddish glow outside one of the windows. It apparently emanated from nowhere. Hundreds of little specks danced and whirled in the spot of light, and as I watched them fascinated, they seemed to take oil the form of a human face. The features were masculine, as was also the arrangement of the hair. Then the mysterious glow disappeared.\" After a few moments there appears a vague form of which the watcher is able to distinguish the head, and to his horror he sees that the features are the same as those of a portrait of the grandfather which is hanging in the picture gallery of the house. \"But oh, the difference in expression! The lips were drawn back in a snarl, disclosing two sets of pearly white teeth, the canines over developed and remarkably sharp. The eyes, an emerald green in colour, stared in a look of consuming hate.\" The horror is revealed. The house is infested by a vampire. In the morning\n\np. 327\n\nthe two friends visit the vault. \"As if by mutual understanding, we both turned toward the coffin on our left. It belonged to the grandfather. We unplaced the lid, and there lay the old Holroyd. He appeared to be sleeping; his face was full of colour, and he had none of the stiffness of death. The hair was matted, the moustache untrimmed, and on the beard were matted stains of a dull brownish hue. But it was his eyes that attracted me. They were greenish, and they glowed with an expression of fiendish malevolence such as I had never seen before. The look of baffled rage on the face might well have adorned the features of the devil in hell.\" They drive a stake through the living corpse, which shrieks and writhes, whilst the gushing blood drenches coffins and floor spurting out in great jets over the very walls. The head is severed from the body, and as the final stroke of the knife cut the connexion a scream issued from the mouth; and the whole corpse fell away into dust, leaving nothing but a wooden stake lying in a bed of bones.\" The remaining three bodies are treated in the same way, and thus the thrall of the curse is lifted from the old house, ten miles from the little town of Charing.\n\nAlthough the genius of Charles Baudelaire, when his art required it, shrank from no extremity of physical horror, yet in his exquisite poem Le Vampire he has rather portrayed the darkness and desolation of the soul:\n\nToi qui, comme un coup de couteau,\nDans mon coeur plaintif est entr\u00e9e;\nToi qui, forte comme un troupeau\nDe d\u00e9mons, vins, folle et par\u00e9e.\n\nDe mon esprit humili\u00e9\nFaire ton lit et ton domaine\n--Inf\u00e2me a qui je suis li\u00e9\nComme le forcat a la cha\u00eene,\n\nComme au jeu le joueur t\u00eatu,\nComme \u00e0 la bouteille l'ivrogne,\nComme aux vermines la charogne,\n--Maudite, maudite sois-tu!\n\nJ'ai pri\u00e9 le glaive rapide\nDe conquerir ma libert\u00e9\nEt j'ai dit au poison perfide\nDe secourir ma l\u00e2chet\u00e9.\n\np. 328\n\nHelas! le poison et le glaive\nM'ont pris en d\u00e9dain et m'ont dit\nTu n'es pas digne qu'on t'enl\u00e8ve\nA ton esclavage maudit.\n\nImb\u00e9cile!--de son empire\nSi nos efforts te d\u00e9livraient,\nTes baisers ressusciteraient\nLe cadavre de ton vampire!\n\nIn England there is a poem--truly of a very different kind--which appears in the life of the famous scientist, James Clerk Maxwell, by Lewis Campbell and William Garnett, verses written by Maxwell in 1845 when he was fourteen Years of age. The verses should not perhaps, because of the youth of the author, be criticized too sharply, and although they show Wardour Street fustian and gimcrack, since the piece is of no great length it may pardonably be quoted here. It is not entirely without a certain feeling after the right atmosphere, and much will be forgiven on account of the precocity. It is grandiosely entitled The Vampyre: Compylt into Meeter by James Clerk Maxwell.\"\n\nThair is a knichte rydis through the wood,\nAnd a douchty knichte is hee.\nAnd sure bee is on a message sent,\nHe rydis sae hastilie.\nHe passit the aik, and hee passit the birk,\nAnd bee passit monie a tre,\nBot plesant to him was the saugh sae slim,\nFor beneath it hee did see\nThe boniest ladye that ever hee saw,\nScho was sae schyn and fair.\nAnd thair scho sat, beneath the saugh,\nKaiming hir gowden hair.\nAnd then the knichte--\"Oh ladye brichte,\nWhat chance has broucht you here?\nBut sae the word, and ye schall gang\nBack to your kindred dear,\"\nThen up and spok the ladye fair--\n\"I have nae friends or kin,\nBot in a little boat I live,\nAmidst the waves' loud din.\"\nThen answered thus the douchty knichte\"\nI'll follow you through all,\nFor gin ye bee in a littel boat,\nThe world to it seemis small.\" p. 329\nThey goed through the wood, and through the wood,\nTo the end of the wood they came:\nAnd when they came to the end of the wood\nThey saw the salt sea faem.\nAnd when they saw the wee, wee boat,\nThat daunced on the top of the wave,\nAnd first got in the ladye fair,\nAnd then the knichte sae brave.\nThey got into the wee, wee boat\nAnd rowed wi' a' their micht\nWhen the knichte sae brave, he turnit about,\nAnd lookit at the ladye bricht\nHe lookit at her bonnie cheik,\nAnd bee lookit at hir twa bricht eyne,\nBot hir rosie cheik growe ghaistly pale,\nAnd schoe seymit as scho deid had been.\nThe fause, fause knichte growe pale with frichte.\nAnd his hair rose up on end,\nFor gane-by days cam to his mynde,\nAnd his former love he kenned.\nThen spake the ladye--\"Thou, fause knichte,\nHast done to me much ill,\nFor didst forsake me long ago,\nBot I am constant still:\nFor though I ligg in the woods sae cald,\nAt rest I canna bee\nUntil I sucks the gude lyfe blude\nOf the man that gart me dee.\"\nHee saw hir lipps were wet wi' blude,\nAnd hee saw hir lufolesse eyne,\nAnd loud bee cry'd, \"get frae my syde,\nThou vampyr corps encleane!\"\nBut no, bee is in hir magic boat,\nAnd on the wyde, wyde sea;\nAnd the vampyr suckis his gude lyfe blude,\nSho suckis him till hee dee.\nSo now beware, whoe'er you are,\nThat walkis in this lone wood:\nBeware of that deceitfull spright,\nThe ghaist that suckis the blude.\n\nThe Vampire Bride, a ballad by the Hon. Henry Liddell, has considerable merit, It may be found in The Wizard of the North, The Vampire Bride, and other Poems, Blackwood, Edinburgh, and Cadell, London, 1833. These stanzas are founded upon the old tale of the knight who having placed a ring--some say his wedding-ring--around the finger of the statue of Venus whilst he is a quoiting, when he would reclaim it\n\np. 330\n\nfinds that the finger is crooked so that the jewel may not be withdrawn, whilst that night a phantom claims him as her spouse. With difficulty is he freed from the thrall of the succubus.\n\nIn 1845 there was published at the Columbian Press Weston-super-mare, a little book entitled The Last of the Vampires, by Smyth Upton. The chief, some critics might say the only, merit of this tale is its excessive rarity. The narrative is somewhat curiously divided into Epochs, the first of which takes place in 1769, the second in 1777, the third and last in 1780. Chapter I opens in an English village named Frampton, but in Chapter II \"we find ourselves upon the borders of Bohemia\" in the Castle Von Oberfels. Four chapters of no great length and somewhat disconnected in their sequence comprise the First Epoch. A little later we meet with the mysterious Lord de Montfort, and apparently he has just committed a murder, since he is one of the two men who stand in a dreary outhouse adjoining Montfort Abbey. \"Red blood, yet warm, stains their murderous hands, and is seen also in pools upon the floor; the same marks are observable, also, on their clothes.\" \"The scene is a fearful one; it is one of those of which the mere recital makes the blood run cold,\" and the writer wisely does not attempt the task. In the penultimate chapter of this extraordinary production we are introduced to \"a certain young German, the Baron Von Oberfels,\" who weds Mary Learmont, the elder daughter of \"Sir James Learmont, who being a Baronet, was, moreover, a Knight of the Bath and M.P.\" Unfortunately the Baron \"was one of that horrible class, the Vampires! He had sold his soul to the evil one, for the enjoyment of perpetual youth; being bound, besides, to what are understood to be the penalties of that wretched and accursed race. Every tenth year a female was sacrificed to his infernal master. Mary Learmont was to be the next victim; may she escape the threatened doom.\" But apparently, so far as I can gather, she is not so lucky for we are vaguely told \"The Baron and his bride departed on his wedding tour. Her father and mother never hear of her more.\" A page or two later there is \"a midnight wedding\" at the Castle Von Oberfels. Of the bride we are told nothing save that she had a \"fair presence.\" \"The Baron Von Oberfels was there, once more arrayed in the\n\np. 331\n\ngarments of a bridegroom.\" The ceremony proceeds. The grand organ peals; the heavenly voices of white-robed choristers added greatly to the beauty of the scene. \"But hark! another noise is heard; sulphureous smoke half fills the sacred building; the floor opens for an instant; and mocking shrieks are audible as the spirit of the Last of the Vampires descended into perdition.\"\n\nI am bound to acknowledge that after a somewhat careful reading of this curious and most disjointed little piece of seventy-six pages the only impression with which I am met is that Mr. Smyth Upton knew nothing whatsoever of what the word vampire connotes. The idea of the victims who are sacrificed for the sake of eternal youth is, of course fairly common and was very effectively utilized by G. W. M. Reynolds in his romance The Necromancer, which ran in Reynolds's Miscellany from Saturday, 27th December, 1851, to Saturday, 31st July, 1852.[66] Incidentally it maybe remarked as a somewhat curious fact that this prolific novelist never availed himself of the vampire tradition in his melodramatic chapters.\n\nThe Vampyre. \"By the Wife of a Medical Man,\" 1858, is a, violent teetotal tract, of twenty-seven short chapters presented in the guise of fiction. The villain of the piece is \"The Vampyre Inn,\" and the dipsomaniac hero--if it be allowable to use the term in such a context--is given to ravings such as these: \"They fly--they bite--they suck my blood--I die. That hideous 'Vampyre!' Its eyes pierce me thro'--they are red--they are bloodshot. Tear it from my pillow. I dare not lie down. It bites--I die! Give me brandy--brandy--more brandy.\"\n\nA Vampire of Souls, by H. M. P., published in 1904, is a book of little value. The hero, George Ventnor, when aged twenty, is killed in a railway accident, and the narrative consists of his after experiences which are singularly material and crude. There is, perhaps, a good touch here and there, but the thing certainly does not deserve to be rescued from oblivion.\n\nIt will have been noticed that beyond the titles these two last works have really little or nothing to do with vampires at all, but we may now consider a romance which may at least be ranked as a very serious rival to--in my opinion it is far ghostlier than--its famous successor Dracula. Varney the Vampire, or, The Feast of Blood, is undoubtedly the best novel\n\np. 332\n\nof Thomas Preskett Prest, a prolific writer of the fourth and fifth decades of the nineteenth century. It is true that his productions published by the well-known Edward Lloyd, of 231, Shoreditch,[67] may be classed as simple \"shockers,\" but none the less he has considerable power in this kind, and he had at any rate the craft of telling his story with skill and address. There is a certain quality in his work, which appeared during the years from 1839 to the earlier fifties, that is entirely lacking in the productions of his fellows. To him have been ascribed, doubtless with some exaggeration, well nigh two hundred titles, but the following list comprises, I believe, his principal romances: Ela, the Outcast, or, the Gipsy of Rosemary Dell; Angelina, or, the Mystery of S. Mark's Abbey, \"a Tale of Other Days \"; The Death Grasp, or, A Father's Curse; Ernnestine De Lacy, or, The Robbers' Foundling; Gallant Tom, or, The Perils of a Sailor Ashore and Afloat, \"an original nautical romance of deep and pathetic interest \"; Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street (the most famous of Prest's novels); Newgate (which has some capital episodes); Emily Fitzormond; Mary Clifford; The Maniac Father, or, The Victim of Seduction; Gertrude of the Rock; Rosalie, or, The Vagrant's Daughter; The Miller's Maid; Jane Brightwell; Blanche, or, The Mystery of the Doomed House; The Blighted Heart, or, The Priory Ruins; Sawney Bean, the Man-eater of Midlothian; The Skeleton Clutch, or, The Goblet of Gore; The Black Monk, or, The Secret of the Grey Turret[68]; The Miller and His Men, or, The Secret Robbers of Bohemia. To Prest also has been attributed, but I conceive without foundation, Susan Hoply, an audacious piracy upon the famous novel by Mrs. Crowe, Susan Hopley.\n\nVarney the Vampire, or, The Feast of Blood, was first published in 1847. It contains no less than CCXX chapters and runs to 868 pages. The many incidents succeed each other with such breathless rapidity that it were well-nigh impossible to attempt any conspectus of the whole romance. The very length would make this analysis a work of extreme difficulty, and incidentally we may note the amazing copiousness of Prest which must ever remain a matter for wonderment. Such a romance, for example, as Newgate runs to no less than on, hundred and forty-nine chapters comprising 772 pages. The Maniac Father has fifty-four chapters, each of considerable\n\np. 333\n\nlength, which total 604 pages, and I have not selected these on account of their exceptional volume.\n\nVarney the Vampire was among the most popular of Prest's productions, and on account of its \"unprecedented success\" it was reprinted in 1853 in penny parts. To-day the book is unprocurable and considerable sums have been for many years in vain offered to secure a copy. Indeed, it may be noted that all Prest's work is excessively scarce.\n\nIt is hardly an exaggeration to affirm that of recent years there have been few books which have been more popular than Brain Stoker's Dracula, A tale, and certainly there is no sensational romance which in modern days has achieved so universal a reputation. Since it was first published in 1897, that is to say one and twenty years ago, it has run into a great number of editions, and the name has veritably become a household word. It will prove interesting to inquire into the immediate causes which have brought this book such wide and enduring fame. It has already been remarked that it is well-nigh impossible for a story which deals with the supernatural or the horrible to be sustained to any great length. Elements which at first are almost unendurable, will lose their effect if they are continued, for the reader's mind insensibly becomes inured to fresh emotions of awe and horror, and Dracula is by no means briefly told. In the ordinary reprints (Tenth Edition, 1913) it extends to more than four hundred pages, nor does it escape the penalty of its prolixity. The first part, \"Jonathan Harker's Journal,\" which consists of four chapters is most admirably done, and could the whole story have been sustained at so high a level we should have had a complete masterpiece. But that were scarcely possible. The description of the journey through Transylvania is interesting to a degree, and even has passages which attain to something like charm. \"All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear.\" Very effective is the arrival of the English traveller at the \"vast ruined castle, from, whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose\n\np. 334\n\nbroken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky.\" Very adroitly are the various incidents managed in their quick succession, those mysterious happenings which at last convince the matter-of-fact commonplace young solicitor of Exeter that he is a helpless prisoner in the power of a relentless and fearful being. The continual contrasts between business conversations, the most ordinary events of the dull listless days, and all the while the mantling of dark shadows in the background and the onrushing of some monstrous doom are in these opening chapters most excellently managed.\n\nSo tense a strain could not be preserved, and consequently when we are abruptly transported to Whitby and the rather tedious courtships of Lucy Westenra, who is a lay figure at best, we feel that a good deal of the interest has already begun to evaporate. I would hasten to add that before long it is again picked up, but it is never sustained in the same degree; and good sound sensational fare as we have set before us, fare which I have myself more than once thoroughly enjoyed, yet it is difficult not to feel that one's palate, has been a little spoiled by the nonpareil of an antipast. This is not to say that the various complications are not sufficiently thrilling, but because of their very bounty now and again they most palpably fail of effect, and it can hardly escape notice that the author begins to avail himself of those more extravagant details of vampirism which frankly have no place outside the stories told round a winter's hearth, It would have been better had he confined himself to those particulars which are known and accepted, which indeed have been officially certified and definitely proved. But to have limited himself thus would have meant the shortening of his narrative, and here we return to the point which was made above.\n\nIf we review Dracula from a purely literary point of approach it must be acknowledged that there is much careless writing and many pages could have been compressed and something revised with considerable profit. It is hardly possible to feel any great interest in the characters, they are labels rather than individuals. As I have said, there are passages of graphic beauty, passages of graphic horror, but these again almost entirely occur within the first sixty pages. There are some capital incidents, for example the method by which Lord p. 335 Godalming and his friend obtain admittance to No. 347 Piccadilly. Nor does this by any means stand alone.\n\nHowever, when we have--quite fairly, I hope--thus criticized Dracula, the fact remains that it is a book of unwonted interest and fascination. Accordingly we are bound to acknowledge that the reason for the immense popularity of this romance, the reason why, in spite of obvious faults it is read and re-read--lies in the choice of subject and for this the author deserves all praise.\n\nIt might not have seemed that Dracula would have been a very promising subject for the stage, but nevertheless it was dramatized by Hamilton Deans and produced at the Wimbledon Theatre on 9th March, 1925. This version was performed in London at the Little Theatre, 14th February, 1927. On the preceding Thursday the Daily Mirror published a photograph of the late Mr. Brain Stoker accompanied by the following paragraphs. \"Herewith, one of the very few photographs of the late Brain Stoker, who, besides being Sir Henry Irving's manager for years, was an industrious novelist. As I have already said, a dramatic version of his most famous book, 'Dracula,' is to be done at the Little on Monday, and the scene of the Grand Guignol plays is appropriate, for the new piece, I hear, is so full of gruesome thrills that, in the provinces women having been carried fainting from the auditorium. Truly we take our pleasures sadly.\n\n\"The dramatic adaptation is by Hamilton Deans, whose grandfather, Colonel Deans, and the Rev. Abraham Stoker, Bram's father, lived on adjoining estates in County Dublin. Young Bram and Hamilton Deane's mother, then a young girl, were great friends. Stoker had the book 'Dracula' in his mind, and the young people used to discuss its possibilities. Strange that it should be young Hamilton Deane who has dramatized the book and brought the play to London.\"\n\nAt the Little Theatre the cast of Dracula was as follows: Count Dracula, Raymond Huntley; Abraham van Helsing, Hamilton Deane; Dr. Seward, Stuart Lomath; Jonathan Harker, Bernard Guest; Quincey P. Morris, Frieda Hearn; Lord Godalming, Peter Jackson; R. M. Renfield, Bernard Jukes; The Warden, Jack Howarth; The Parlourmaid, Hilda Macleod; The Housemaid, Betty Murgatroyd; Mina Harker, Dora Mary Patrick.\n\np. 336\n\nBy no stretch could it be called a good play, whilst the presentation, at the best, can hardly be described as more than reasonably adequate. In one or two instances the effects, upon which so much depends and which obviously demanded the most scrupulous care, were so clumsily contrived as to excite an involuntary smile. \"It was only a step from the devilish to the ridiculous on Monday night,\" said the Era, 16th February, 1927. Very remarkable was a lady, dressed in the uniform of a hospital nurse who sat in the vestibule of the theatre, and it was bruited that her services were required by members of the audience who were overcome owing to the horrors of the drama. I can only say that I find this canard impossible to believe, quodcumque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi. As an advertisement, and it can surely have been nothing else, the attendance of a nurse was in deplorable taste. I am informed that after the first few weeks a kind of epilogue was spoken when all the characters were assembled upon the stage, and it was explained that the audience must not be distressed at what they had seen, that it was comically intended for their entertainment. So gross a lapse of good manners, not to speak of the artistic indecorum, is hardly credible.[69]\n\nConfessedly the play was extremely weak, and yet such is the fascination of this subject that it had an exceptional success, and triumphantly made its way from theatre to theatre. On 25th July, 1927, Dracula was transferred to the Duke of York's; on the 29th August, following to the Prince of Wales, on 10th October to the Garrick; and all the while it was given to thronging houses. It has also toured, and at the present moment is still touring the provincial theatres with the most marked success, the drama being given with more spirit and vigour than originally was the case at the Little, and Wilfrid Fletcher in particular playing the lunatic Renfield with a real touch of wistful pathos and uncanny horror. This is is extremely instructive, and it is curious that the vogue of the \"vampire play\" in London should be repeated almost exactly after the interval of a century. On 5th November, 1927, a new version of Dracula by Charles Morrel was presented at the Court Theatre, Warrington.\n\nIn America the dramatization of Dracula was produced at the Shubert, New Haven, 19th September, 1927. This was given at the Fulton, New York, upon the following 5th October.\n\np. 337\n\nJonathan Harker was acted by Terence Neil; Abraham Van Helsing by Edward Van Sloan; Renfield by Bernard Jukes; and Count Dracula by Bela Lugoni .\n\nAs I have before remarked, the striking fact that an indifferent play should prove so successful can, I think, only be attributed to the fascination of the theme. Consciously or unconsciously it is realized that the vampire tradition contains far more truth than the ordinary individual cares to appreciate and acknowledge. \"La fable du vampire est peut-\u00eatre, la plus universelle de nos superstitions. . . . Elle a partout l'autorit\u00e9 de la tradition: elle ne manque ni de cello de la philosophic ni de celle de la m\u00e9dicine.

life, I promise you that shit\n\n[Verse 2: Action Bronson]\nSwedish features through the window of a Lincoln on the Bell swerving\nI felt certain I was born to be the best Earthling\nFelt worthless, so many Xs and circles\nOn my mother neck I know I serve a purpose\nSmoke the same shit that turns a normal turtle to a ninja turtle\nNeo-ninja doing ? on Myrtle\nThe motherfucker making a drug look like Urkel\nForeign shooters like T\u00fcrko\u011flu\n740 with the curtain and set to 1020 degrees\nEyes closed switching speeds, hitting the weave\nI shapeshift to a disease, attack your lung and cripple your knees\nR&b chicks are twisted with ease, blitzkrieg\nYou still posing for your little-league pictures\nI'm drinking beer straight out the pitcher\nI'll put your moms in an armbar at the bar-mitzvah\nIrish linen on the king\nI'm guaranteed I'm gonna win another ring\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Prodigy]\nI supercede that crap, now bitches want this hard shit\nNiggas want this crack, them songs you got that's garbage\nParalyze your ears, stop talking, this P rapping\nBeen doing this for years, know money I keep racking, up\nCome with it nigga, get beat the fuck, up\nNext to me you're chuck meat\nYeah, we just committed suicide\nWith this swammi I get busy B; do or die\nBig bar champion, the Henny and the rap flow\nThe great black shark, you just a little mackeral\nMy bitch appetite for power surpass yours\nNow imagine my thoughts while I'm alone and you paused\nThat's 600 horses stomping on your neck strap\nThat's me, g-leaning with the pistol on my lap\nGot a 3:00 your death, I could pencil you in\nYa'll niggas is chow, my gun fit to dig in\n\n[Hook]1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2302273", "artist_names":

the sun from shining?\nWhat makes the world go round?\nHow can you mend this broken man?\nHow can a loser ever win?\nPlease help me mend my broken heart and let me live again\n[Verse 2]\nI can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees\nAnd misty memories of days gone by\nWe could never see tomorrow\nNo one said a word about the sorrow\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd how can you mend a broken

without finding much that is satisfying and still more that is encouraging. Our own country is leading the world in the general readjustment to the results of the great conflict. Many of its burdens will bear heavily upon us for years, and the secondary and indirect effects we must expect to experience for some time. But we are beginning to comprehend more definitely what course should be pursued, what remedies ought to be applied, what actions should be taken for our deliverance, and are clearly manifesting a determined will faithfully and conscientiously to adopt these methods of relief. Already we have sufficiently rearranged our domestic affairs so that confidence has returned, business has revived, and we appear to be entering an era of prosperity which is gradually reaching into every part of the Nation. Realizing that we can not live unto ourselves alone, we have contributed of our resources and our counsel to the relief of the suffering and the settlement of the disputes among the European nations. Because of what America is and what America has done, a firmer courage, a higher hope, inspires the heart of all humanity.\t   1\nThese results have not occurred by mere chance. They have been secured by a constant and enlightened effort marked by many sacrifices and extending over many generations. We can not continue these brilliant successes in the future, unless we continue to learn from the past. It is necessary to keep the former experiences of our country both at home and abroad continually before us, if we are to have any science of government. If we wish to erect new structures, we must have a definite knowledge of the old foundations. We must realize that human nature is about the most constant thing in the universe and that the essentials of human relationship do not change. We must frequently take our bearings from these fixed stars of our political firmament if we expect to hold a true course. If we examine carefully what we have done, we can determine the more accurately what we can do.\t2\nWe stand at the opening of the one hundred and fiftieth year since our national consciousness first asserted itself by unmistakable action with an array of force. The old sentiment of detached and dependent colonies disappeared in the new sentiment of a united and independent Nation. Men began to discard the narrow confines of a local charter for the broader opportunities of a national constitution. Under the eternal urge of freedom we became an independent Nation. A little less than 50 years later that freedom and independence were reasserted in the face of all the world, and guarded, supported, and secured by the Monroe doctrine. The narrow fringe of States along the Atlantic seaboard advanced its frontiers across the hills and plains of an intervening continent until it passed down the golden slope to the Pacific. We made freedom a birthright. We extended our domain over distant islands in order to safeguard our own interests and accepted the consequent obligation to bestow justice and liberty upon less favored peoples. In the defense of our own ideals and in the general cause of liberty we entered the Great War. When victory had been fully secured, we withdrew to our own shores unrecompensed save in the consciousness of duty done.\t3\nThroughout all these experiences we have enlarged our freedom, we have strengthened our independence. We have been, and propose to be, more and more American. We believe that we can best serve our own country and most successfully discharge our obligations to humanity by continuing to be openly and candidly, intensely and scrupulously, American. If we have any heritage, it has been that. If we have any destiny, we have found it in that direction.\t4\nBut if we wish to continue to be distinctively American, we must continue to make that term comprehensive enough to embrace the legitimate desires of a civilized and enlightened people determined in all their relations to pursue a conscientious and religious life. We can not permit ourselves to be narrowed and dwarfed by slogans and phrases. It is not the adjective, but the substantive, which is of real importance. It is not the name of the action, but the result of the action, which is the chief concern. It will be well not to be too much disturbed by the thought of either isolation or entanglement of pacifists and militarists. The physical configuration of the earth has separated us from all of the Old World, but the common brotherhood of man, the highest law of all our being, has united us by inseparable bonds with all humanity. Our country represents nothing but peaceful intentions toward all the earth, but it ought not to fail to maintain such a military force as comports with the dignity and security of a great people. It ought to be a balanced force, intensely modern, capable of defense by sea and land, beneath the surface and in the air. But it should be so conducted that all the world may see in it, not a menace, but an instrument of security and peace.\t5\nThis Nation believes thoroughly in an honorable peace under which the rights of its citizens are to be everywhere protected. It has never found that the necessary enjoyment of such a peace could be maintained only by a great and threatening array of arms. In common with other nations, it is now more determined than ever to promote peace through friendliness and good will, through mutual understandings and mutual forbearance. We have never practiced the policy of competitive armaments. We have recently committed ourselves by covenants with the other great nations to a limitation of our sea power. As one result of this, our Navy ranks larger, in comparison, than it ever did before. Removing the burden of expense and jealousy, which must always accrue from a keen rivalry, is one of the most effective methods of diminishing that unreasonable hysteria and misunderstanding which are the most potent means of fomenting war. This policy represents a new departure in the world. It is a thought, an ideal, which has led to an entirely new line of action. It will not be easy to maintain. Some never moved from their old positions, some are constantly slipping back to the old ways of thought and the old action of seizing a musket and relying on force. America has taken the lead in this new direction, and that lead America must continue to hold. If we expect others to rely on our fairness and justice we must show that we rely on their fairness and justice.\t6\nIf we are to judge by past experience, there is much to be hoped for in international relations from frequent conferences and consultations. We have before us the beneficial results of the Washington conference and the various consultations recently held upon European affairs, some of which were in response to our suggestions and in some of which we were active participants. Even the failures can not but be accounted useful and an immeasurable advance over threatened or actual warfare. I am strongly in favor of continuation of this policy, whenever conditions are such that there is even a promise that practical and favorable results might be secured.\t7\nIn conformity with the principle that a display of reason rather than a threat of force should be the determining factor in the intercourse among nations, we have long advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes by methods of arbitration and have negotiated many treaties to secure that result. The same considerations should lead to our adherence to the Permanent Court of International Justice. Where great principles are involved, where great movements are under way which promise much for the welfare of humanity by reason of the very fact that many other nations have given such movements their actual support, we ought not to withhold our own sanction because of any small and inessential difference, but only upon the ground of the most important and compelling fundamental reasons. We can not barter away our independence or our sovereignty, but we ought to engage in no refinements of logic, no sophistries, and no subterfuges, to argue away the undoubted duty of this country by reason of the might of its numbers, the power of its resources, and its position of leadership in the world, actively and comprehensively to signify its approval and to bear its full share of the responsibility of a candid and disinterested attempt at the establishment of a tribunal for the administration of even-handed justice between nation and nation. The weight of our enormous influence must be cast upon the side of a reign not of force but of law and trial, not by battle but by reason.\t8\nWe have never any wish to interfere in the political conditions of any other countries. Especially are we determined not to become implicated in the political controversies of the Old World. With a great deal of hesitation, we have responded to appeals for help to maintain order, protect life and property, and establish responsible government in some of the small countries of the Western Hemisphere. Our private citizens have advanced large sums of money to assist in the necessary financing and relief of the Old World. We have not failed, nor shall we fail to respond, whenever necessary to mitigate human suffering and assist in the rehabilitation of distressed nations. These, too, are requirements which must be met by reason of our vast powers and the place we hold in the world.\t9\nSome of the best thought of mankind has long been seeking for a formula for permanent peace. Undoubtedly the clarification of the principles of international law would be helpful, and the efforts of scholars to prepare such a work for adoption by the various nations should have our sympathy and support. Much may be hoped for from the earnest studies of those who advocate the outlawing of aggressive war. But all these plans and preparations, these treaties and covenants, will not of themselves be adequate. One of the greatest dangers to peace lies in the economic pressure to which people find themselves subjected. One of the most practical things to be done in the world is to seek arrangements under which such pressure may be removed, so that opportunity may be renewed and hope may be revived. There must be some assurance that effort and endeavor will be followed by success and prosperity. In the making and financing of such adjustments there is not only an opportunity, but a real duty, for America to respond with her counsel and her resources. Conditions must be provided under which people can make a living and work out of their difficulties. But there is another element, more important than all, without which there can not be the slightest hope of a permanent peace. That element lies in the heart of humanity. Unless the desire for peace be cherished there, unless this fundamental and only natural source of brotherly love be cultivated to its highest degree, all artificial efforts will be in vain. Peace will come when there is realization that only under a reign of law, based on righteousness and supported by the religious conviction of the brotherhood of man, can there be any hope of a complete and satisfying life. Parchment will fail, the sword will fail, it is only the spiritual nature of man that can be triumphant.\t10\nIt seems altogether probable that we can contribute most to these important objects by maintaining our position of political detachment and independence. We are not identified with any Old World interests. This position should be made more and more clear in our relations with all foreign countries. We are at peace with all of them. Our program is never to oppress, but always to assist. But while we do justice to others, we must require that justice be done to us. With us a treaty of peace means peace, and a treaty of amity means amity. We have made great contributions to the settlement of contentious differences in both Europe and Asia. But there is a very definite point beyond which we can not go. We can only help those who help themselves. Mindful of these limitations, the one great duty that stands out requires us to use our enormous powers to trim the balance of the world.\t11\nWhile we can look with a great deal of pleasure upon what we have done abroad, we must remember that our continued success in that direction depends upon what we do at home. Since its very outset, it has been found necessary to conduct our Government by means of political parties. That system would not have survived from generation to generation if it had not been fundamentally sound and provided the best instrumentalities for the most complete expression of the popular will. It is not necessary to claim that it has always worked perfectly. It is enough to know that nothing better has been devised. No one would deny that there should be full and free expression and an opportunity for independence of action within the party. There is no salvation in a narrow and bigoted partisanship. But if there is to be responsible party government, the party label must be something more than a mere device for securing office. Unless those who are elected under the same party designation are willing to assume sufficient responsibility and exhibit sufficient loyalty and coherence, so that they can cooperate with each other in the support of the broad general principles, of the party platform, the election is merely a mockery, no decision is made at the polls, and there is no representation of the popular will. Common honesty and good faith with the people who support a party at the polls require that party, when it enters office, to assume the control of that portion of the Government to which it has been elected. Any other course is bad faith and a violation of the party pledges.\t12\nWhen the country has bestowed its confidence upon a party by making it a majority in the Congress, it has a right to expect such unity of action as will make the party majority an effective instrument of government. This Administration has come into power with a very clear and definite mandate from the people. The expression of the popular will in favor of maintaining our constitutional guarantees was overwhelming and decisive. There was a manifestation of such faith in the integrity of the courts that we can consider that issue rejected for some time to come. Likewise, the policy of public ownership of railroads and certain electric utilities met with unmistakable defeat. The people declared that they wanted their rights to have not a political but a judicial determination, and their independence and freedom continued and supported by having the ownership and control of their property, not in the Government, but in their own hands. As they always do when they have a fair chance, the people demonstrated that they are sound and are determined to have a sound government.\t13\nWhen we turn from what was rejected to inquire what was accepted, the policy that stands out with the greatest clearness is that of economy in public expenditure with reduction and reform of taxation. The principle involved in this effort is that of conservation. The resources of this country are almost beyond computation. No mind can comprehend them. But the cost of our combined governments is likewise almost beyond definition. Not only those who are now making their tax returns, but those who meet the enhanced cost of existence in their monthly bills, know by hard experience what this great burden is and what it does. No matter what others may want, these people want a drastic economy. They are opposed to waste. They know that extravagance lengthens the hours and diminishes the rewards of their labor. I favor the policy of economy, not because I wish to save money, but because I wish to save people. The men and women of this country who toil are the ones who bear the cost of the Government. Every dollar that we carelessly waste means that their life will be so much the more meager. Every dollar that we prudently save means that their life will be so much the more abundant. Economy is idealism in its most practical form.\t14\nIf extravagance were not reflected in taxation, and through taxation both directly and indirectly injuriously affecting the people, it would not be of so much consequence. The wisest and soundest method of solving our tax problem is through economy. Fortunately, of all the great nations this country is best in a position to adopt that simple remedy. We do not any longer need wartime revenues. The collection of any taxes which are not absolutely required, which do not beyond reasonable doubt contribute to the public welfare, is only a species of legalized larceny. Under this republic the rewards of industry belong to those who earn them. The only constitutional tax is the tax which ministers to public necessity. The property of the country belongs to the people of the country. Their title is absolute. They do not support any privileged class; they do not need to maintain great military forces; they ought not to be burdened with a great array of public employees. They are not required to make any contribution to Government expenditures except that which they voluntarily assess upon themselves through the action of their own representatives. Whenever taxes become burdensome a remedy can be applied by the people; but if they do not act for themselves, no one can be very successful in acting for them.\t15\nThe time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction, when, unless we wish to hamper the people in their right to earn a living, we must have tax reform. The method of raising revenue ought not to impede the transaction of business; it ought to encourage it. I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong. We can not finance the country, we can not improve social conditions, through any system of injustice, even if we attempt to inflict it upon the rich. Those who suffer the most harm will be the poor. This country believes in prosperity. It is absurd to suppose that it is envious of those who are already prosperous. The wise and correct course to follow in taxation and all other economic legislation is not to destroy those who have already secured success but to create conditions under which every one will have a better chance to be successful. The verdict of the country has been given on this question. That verdict stands. We shall do well to heed it.\t16\nThese questions involve moral issues. We need not concern ourselves much about the rights of property if we will faithfully observe the rights of persons. Under our institutions their rights are supreme. It is not property but the right to hold property, both great and small, which our Constitution guarantees. All owners of property are charged with a service. These rights and duties have been revealed, through the conscience of society, to have a divine sanction. The very stability of our society rests upon production and conservation. For individuals or for governments to waste and squander their resources is to deny these rights and disregard these obligations. The result of economic dissipation to a nation is always moral decay.\t17\nThese policies of better international understandings, greater economy, and lower taxes have contributed largely to peaceful and prosperous industrial relations. Under the helpful influences of restrictive immigration and a protective tariff, employment is plentiful, the rate of pay is high, and wage earners are in a state of contentment seldom before seen. Our transportation systems have been gradually recovering and have been able to meet all the requirements of the service. Agriculture has been very slow in reviving, but the price of cereals at last indicates that the day of its deliverance is at hand.\t18\nWe are not without our problems, but our most important problem is not to secure new advantages but to maintain those which we already possess. Our system of government made up of three separate and independent departments, our divided sovereignty composed of Nation and State, the matchless wisdom that is enshrined in our Constitution, all these need constant effort and tireless vigilance for their protection and support.\t19\nIn a republic the first rule for the guidance of the citizen is obedience to law. Under a despotism the law may be imposed upon the subject. He has no voice in its making, no influence in its administration, it does not represent him. Under a free government the citizen makes his own laws, chooses his own administrators, which do represent him. Those who want their rights respected under the Constitution and the law ought to set the example themselves of observing the Constitution and the law. While there may be those of high intelligence who violate the law at times, the barbarian and the defective always violate it. Those who disregard the rules of society are not exhibiting a superior intelligence, are not promoting freedom and independence, are not following the path of civilization, but are displaying the traits of ignorance, of servitude, of savagery, and treading the way that leads back to the jungle.\t20\nThe essence of a republic is representative government. Our Congress represents the people and the States. In all legislative affairs it is the natural collaborator with the President. In spite of all the criticism which often falls to its lot, I do not hesitate to say that there is no more independent and effective legislative body in the world. It is, and should be, jealous of its prerogative. I welcome its cooperation, and expect to share with it not only the responsibility, but the credit, for our common effort to secure beneficial legislation.\t21\nThese are some of the principles which America represents. We have not by any means put them fully into practice, but we have strongly signified our belief in them. The encouraging feature of our country is not that it has reached its destination, but that it has overwhelmingly expressed its determination to proceed in the right direction. It is true that we could, with profit, be less sectional and more national in our thought. It would be well if we could replace much that is only a false and ignorant prejudice with a true and enlightened pride of race. But the last election showed that appeals to class and nationality had little effect. We were all found loyal to a common citizenship. The fundamental precept of liberty is toleration. We can not permit any inquisition either within or without the law or apply any religious test to the holding of office. The mind of America must be forever free.\t22\nIt is in such contemplations, my fellow countrymen, which are not exhaustive but only representative, that I find ample warrant for satisfaction and encouragement. We should not let the much that is to do obscure the much which has been done. The past and present show faith and hope and courage fully justified. Here stands our country, an example of tranquillity at home, a patron of tranquillity abroad. Here stands its Government, aware of its might but obedient to its conscience. Here it will continue to stand, seeking peace and prosperity, solicitous for the welfare of the wage earner, promoting enterprise, developing waterways and natural resources, attentive to the intuitive counsel of womanhood, encouraging education, desiring the advancement of religion, supporting the cause of justice and honor among the nations. America seeks no earthly empire built on blood and force. No ambition, no temptation, lures her to thought of foreign dominions. The legions which she sends forth are armed, not with the sword, but with the cross. The higher state to which she seeks the allegiance of all mankind is not of human, but of divine origin. She cherishes no purpose save to merit the favor of Almighty God.\t23Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/662412", "artist_names": "The Moments", "full_title": "Love

COFFEE SHOP \u2013 MORNING\n\nA normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.\nIt's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,\nthere's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching\non bacon and eating eggs.\n\nTwo of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The\nYoung Man has a slight working-class English accent and,\nlike his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're\ngoing out of style.\n\nIt is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or\nhow old she is; everything she does contradicts something\nshe did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is\nto be said in a rapid pace \"HIS GIRL FRIDAY\" fashion.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nNo, forget it, it's too risky. I'm\nthrough doin' that shit.\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYou always say that, the same thing\nevery time: never again, I'm through,\ntoo dangerous.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI know that's what I always say. I'm\nalways right too, but \u2013\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\n\u2013 but you forget about it in a day\nor two -\n\nYOUNG MAN\n\u2013 yeah, well, the days of me\nforgittin' are over, and the days of\nme rememberin' have just begun.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nWhen you go on like this, you know\nwhat you sound like?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI sound like a sensible fucking man,\nis what I sound like.\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYou sound like a duck.\n(imitates a duck)\nQuack, quack, quack, quack, quack,\nquack, quack...\n\nYOUNG MAN\nWell take heart, 'cause you're never\ngonna hafta hear it again.

I got all tonight to quack.\n\nA WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.\n\nWAITRESS\nCan I get anybody anymore coffee?\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nOh yes, thank you.\n\nThe Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man\nlights up another cigarette.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI'm doin' fine.\n\nThe Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his\nsmoke.\n\nThe Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her\ncoffee.\n\nThe Young Man goes right back into it.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI mean the way it is now, you're\ntakin' the same fuckin' risk as when\nyou rob a bank. You take more of a\nrisk. Banks are easier!  Federal\nbanks aren't supposed to stop you\nanyway, during a robbery. They're\ninsured, why should they care? You\ndon't even need a gun in a federal\nbank. I heard about this guy, walked\ninto a federal bank with a portable\nphone, handed the phone to the teller,\nthe guy on the other end of the phone\nsaid: \"We got this guy's little girl,\nand if you don't give him all your\nmoney, we're gonna kill 'er.\"\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nDid it work?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nFuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm\ntalkin' about!

There probably never\nwas a little girl \u2013 the point of the\nstory isn't the little girl. The\npoint of the story is they robbed\nthe bank with a telephone.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYou wanna rob banks?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,\nI'm just illustrating that if we\ndid, it would be easier than what we\nbeen doin'.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nSo you don't want to be a bank robber?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nNaw, all those guys are goin' down\nthe same road, either dead or servin'\ntwenty.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nAnd no more liquor stores?\n\nYOUNG MAN\nWhat have we been talking about?\nYeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,\nit ain't the giggle it usta be. Too\nmany foreigners own liquor stores.\nVietnamese, Koreans, they can't\nfuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:\n\"Empty out the register,\" and they\ndon't know what it fuckin' means.\nThey make it too personal. We keep\non, one of those gook motherfuckers'\ngonna make us kill 'em.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nI'm not gonna kill anybody.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI don't wanna kill anybody either.\nBut they'll probably put us in a\nsituation where it's us of them. And\nif it's not the gooks, it these old\nJews who've owned the store for\nfifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got\nGrandpa Irving sittin' behind the\ncounter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try\nwalkin' into one of those stores\nwith nothin' but a telephone, see\nhow far it gets you. Fuck it, forget\nit, we're out of it.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nWell, what else is there, day jobs?\n\nYOUNG MAN\n(laughing)\nNot this life.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nWell what then?\n\nHe calls to the Waitress.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nGarcon! Coffee!\n\nThen looks to his girl.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nThis place.\n\nThe Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.\n\nWAITRESS\n(snotty)\n\"Garcon\" means boy.\n\nShe splits.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nHere? It's a coffee shop.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nWhat's wrong with that? People never\nrob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor\nstores, gas stations, you get your\nhead blown off stickin' up one of\nthem. Restaurants, on the other hand,\nyou catch with their pants down.\nThey're not expecting to get robbed,\nor not as expecting.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\n(taking to idea)\nI bet in places like this you could\ncut down on the hero factor.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nCorrect. Just like banks, these places\nare insured. The managers don't give\na fuck, they're just tryin' to get\nya out the door before you start\npluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget\nit, they ain't takin' a bullet for\nthe register. Busboys, some wetback\ngettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour\ngonna really give a fuck you're\nstealin' from the owner. Customers\nare sittin' there with food in their\nmouths, they don't know what's goin'\non. One minute they're havin' a Denver\nomelet, next minute somebody's\nstickin' a gun in their face.\n\nThe Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man\ncontinues in a low voice.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nSee, I got the idea last liquor store\nwe stuck up. 'Member all those\ncustomers kept comin' in?\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYeah.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nThen you got the idea to take\neverybody's wallet.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nUh-huh.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nThat was a good idea.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nThanks.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nWe made more from the wallets then\nwe did the register.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nYes we did.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nA lot of people go to restaurants.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nA lot of wallets.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nPretty smart, huh?\n\nThe Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new\ninformation.\n\nShe sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The\ntired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the\nmotions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the\nCOOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's\nface.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nPretty smart.\n(into it)\nI'm ready, let's go, right here,\nright now.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nRemember, same as before, you're\ncrowd control, I handle the employees.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nGot it.\n\nThey both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on\nthe table. He looks at her and she back at him.\n\nYOUNG WOMAN\nI love you, Pumpkin.\n\nYOUNG MAN\nI love you, Honey Bunny.\n\nAnd with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,\nstand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona\nis that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is\nthat of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.\n\nPUMPKIN\n(yelling to all)\nEverybody be cool this is a robbery!\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nAny of you fuckin' pricks move and\nI'll execute every one of you\nmotherfuckers!  Got that?\n\nCUT TO:\n\nCREDIT SEQUENCE:\n\n\"PULP FICTION\"\n\nINT.

I mean you\ncan't walk into a restaurant, roll a\njoint, and start puffin' away. You're\nonly supposed to smoke in your home\nor certain designated places.\n\nJULES\nThose are hash bars?\n\nVINCENT\nYeah, it breaks down like this: it's\nlegal to buy it, it's legal to own\nit and, if you're the proprietor of\na hash bar, it's legal to sell it.\nIt's legal to carry it, which doesn't\nreally matter 'cause \u2013 get a load of\nthis \u2013 if the cops stop you, it's\nillegal for this to search you.\nSearching you is a right that the\ncops in Amsterdam don't have.\n\nJULES\nThat did it, man \u2013 I'm fuckin' goin',\nthat's all there is to it.\n\nVINCENT\nYou'll dig it the most.

But you know what they put on\nfrench fries in Holland instead of\nketchup?\n\nJULES\nWhat?\n\nVINCENT\nMayonnaise.\n\nJULES\nGoddamn!\n\nVINCENT\nI seen 'em do it.

And they show\nthat one show to the people who pick\nthe shows, and on the strength of\nthat one show, they decide if they\nwant to make more shows. Some get\naccepted and become TV programs, and\nsome don't, and become nothing. She\nstarred in one of the ones that became\nnothing.\n\nThey enter the apartment building.\n\nINT.

Half-\nblack, half-Samoan, usta call him\nTony Rocky Horror.\n\nVINCENT\nYeah maybe, fat right?\n\nJULES\nI wouldn't go so far as to call the\nbrother fat. He's got a weight\nproblem.

Is it as bad as eatin' her out\n\u2013 no, but you're in the same fuckin'\nballpark.\n\nJules stops Vincent.\n\nJULES\nWhoa... whoa... whoa... stop right\nthere.  Eatin' a bitch out, and givin'\na bitch a foot massage ain't even\nthe same fuckin' thing.\n\nVINCENT\nNot the same thing, the same ballpark.\n\nJULES\nIt ain't no ballpark either. Look\nmaybe your method of massage differs\nfrom mine, but touchin' his lady's\nfeet, and stickin' your tongue in\nher holyiest of holyies, ain't the\nsame ballpark, ain't the same league,\nain't even the same fuckin' sport.\nFoot massages don't mean shit.\n\nVINCENT\nHave you ever given a foot massage?\n\nJULES\nDon't be tellin' me about foot\nmassages \u2013 I'm the foot fuckin'\nmaster.\n\nVINCENT\nGiven a lot of 'em?\n\nJULES\nShit yeah.

Vincent, smiling, walks a\nlittle bit behind.\n\nVINCENT\nHow many?\n\nJULES\nFuck you.\n\nVINCENT\nWould you give me a foot massage \u2013\nI'm kinda tired.\n\nJULES\nMan, you best back off, I'm gittin'\npissed \u2013 this is the door.\n\nThe two men stand in front of the door numbered \"49.\" They\nwhisper.\n\nJULES\nWhat time is it?\n\nVINCENT\n(checking his watch)\nSeven-twenty-two in the morning.\n\nJULES\nIt ain't quite time, let's hang back.\n\nThey move a little away from the door, facing each other,\nstill whispering.\n\nJULES\nLook, just because I wouldn't give\nno man a foot massage, don't make it\nright for Marsellus to throw Antwan\noff a building into a glass-\nmotherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the\nway the nigger talks. That ain't\nright, man. Motherfucker do that to\nme, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause\nI'd kill'a motherfucker.\n\nVINCENT\nI'm not sayin' he was right, but\nyou're sayin' a foot massage don't\nmean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.\nI've given a million ladies a million\nfoot massages and they all meant\nsomethin'.

Why you so interested in big\nman's wife?\n\nVINCENT\nWell, Marsellus is leavin' for Florida\nand when he's gone, he wants me to\ntake care of Mia.\n\nJULES\nTake care of her?\n\nMaking a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.\n\nVINCENT\nNot that! Take her out. Show her a\ngood time. Don't let her get lonely.\n\nJULES\nYou're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace\nout on a date?\n\nVINCENT\nIt ain't a date. It's like when you\nand your buddy's wife go to a movie\nor somethin'.

APARTMENT (ROOM 49) \u2013 MORNING\n\nTHREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a\ntable with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.\n\nOne of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to\nREVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.\n\nJULES\nHey kids.\n\nThe two men stroll inside.\n\nThe three young caught-off-guard Guys are:\n\nMARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the\nscene progresses, back into the corner.\n\nROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a \"Flock of\nSeagulls\" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the\ntable with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.\n\nBRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.\n\nVincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in\ntheir pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.\n\nJULES\nHow you boys doin'?\n\nNo answer.\n\nJULES\n(to Brett)\nAm I trippin', or did I just ask you\na question.\n\nBRETT\nWe're doin' okay.\n\nAs Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.\n\nJULES\nDo you know who we are?\n\nBrett shakes his head: \"No.\"\n\nJULES\nWe're associates of your business\npartner Marsellus Wallace, you\nremember your business partner\ndont'ya?\n\nNo answer.\n\nJULES\n(to Brett)\nNow I'm gonna take a wild guess here:\nyou're Brett, right?\n\nBRETT\nI'm Brett.\n\nJULES\nI thought so.

Me, I can't\nusually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend's\na vegetarian. Which more or less\nmakes me a vegetarian, but I sure\nlove the taste of a good burger.\n(to Brett)\nYou know what they call a Quarter\nPounder with Cheese in France?\n\nBRETT\nNo.\n\nJULES\nTell 'em, Vincent.\n\nVINCENT\nRoyale with Cheese.\n\nJULES\nRoyale with Cheese, you know why\nthey call it that?\n\nBRETT\nBecause of the metric system?\n\nJULES\nCheck out the big brain on Brett.\nYou'a smart motherfucker, that's\nright.

We can't see\nwhat's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent\njust stares at it, transfixed.\n\nJULES\nWe happy?\n\nNo answer from the transfixed Vincent.\n\nJULES\nVincent!\n\nVincent looks up at Jules.\n\nJULES\nWe happy?\n\nClosing the case.\n\nVINCENT\nWe're happy.\n\nBRETT\n(to Jules)\nLook, what's your name?

When we\nentered into this thing, we only had\nthe best intentions \u2013\n\nAs Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger\nthree times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.\n\nVince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.\n\nBrett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,\nbut he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.\n\nJULES\n(to Brett)\nOh, I'm sorry. Did that break your\nconcentration? I didn't mean to do\nthat.  Please, continue. I believe\nyou were saying something about \"best\nintentions.\"\n\nBrett can't say a word.\n\nJULES\nWhatsamatter? Oh, you were through\nanyway.  Well, let me retort. Would\nyou describe for me what Marsellus\nWallace looks like?\n\nBrett still can't speak.\n\nJules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing\nthe only barrier between himself and Brett.

Ya tried ta fuck\n'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett?\n\nBRETT\n(in spasm)\nYes.\n\nJULES\nThere's a passage I got memorized,\nseems appropriate for this situation:\nEzekiel 25:17. \"The path of the\nrighteous man is beset on all sides\nby the inequities of the selfish and\nthe tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is\nhe who, in the name of charity and\ngood will, shepherds the weak through\nthe valley of darkness, for he is\ntruly his brother's keeper and the\nfinder of lost children. And I will\nstrike down upon thee with great\nvengeance and furious anger those\nwho attempt to poison and destroy my\nbrothers. And you will know my name\nis the Lord when I lay my vengeance\nupon you.\"\n\nThe two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting\nBrett.\n\nAGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:\n\n\"VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE\"\n\nFADE IN:\n\nMEDIUM SHOT \u2013 BUTCH COOLIDGE\n\nWe FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old\nprizefighter.

We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME,\nlooking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching\nbusiness.\n\nBUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure\nthat is Marsellus.\n\nButch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend\nof Marsellus, he better let it go \u2013 for now.\n\nENGLISH DAVE (O.S.)\nPack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.\n\nButch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts.

They don't\nuse that when they pierce your\nnipples, do they?\n\nJODY\nForget that gun. That gun goes against\nthe entire idea behind piercing. All\nof my piercing, sixteen places on my\nbody, every one of 'em done with a\nneedle. Five in each ear. One through\nthe nipple on my left breast. One\nthrough my right nostril.

I'm\ncurious, why would you get a stud in\nyour tongue?\n\nJody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious\nthing in the world.\n\nJODY\nIt's a sex thing.

JACKRABBIT SLIM'S \u2013 NIGHT\n\nIn the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over\nL.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're\nall basically the same. Decor out of an \"Archie\" comic book,\nGolden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,\nsaucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the\nFats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and\nover prices that pay for all this bullshit.\n\nBut then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's\ndiners.\n\nEither the best or the worst, depending on your point of\nview.\n\nVincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with\na neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a\nred windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath\nthe cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that\nis the slogan: \"Next best thing to a time machine.\"\n\nVINCENT\nWhat the fuck is this place?\n\nMIA\nThis is Jackrabbit Slim's. An Elvis\nman should love it.\n\nVINCENT\nCome on, Mia, let's go get a steak.\n\nMIA\nYou can get a steak here, daddy-o.\nDon't be a...\n\nMia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on\nthe screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.\n\nVINCENT\nAfter you, kitty-cat.\n\nINT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S \u2013 NIGHT\n\nCompared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint\nEnglish pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over\nthe wall\n\n(\"ROCK ALL NIGHT,\" \"HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL,\" \"ATTACK OF\nTHE CRAB MONSTER,\" and \"MACHINE GUN KELLY\"). The booths that\nthe patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s\ncars.\n\nIn the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign\non the wall states, \"No shoes allowed.\" Some wannabe beboppers\n(actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or\nbarefeet.\n\nThe picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,\nB & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The\nWAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons:\nMARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and\nLEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing\nappropriate costumes.\n\nVincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red\n'59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting\na big button on his chest that says: \"Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing\nyou please me.\"\n\nBUDDY\nHi, I'm Buddy, what can I get'cha?\n\nVINCENT\nI'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.\n\nBUDDY\nHow d'ya want it, burnt to a crisp,\nor bloody as hell?\n\nVINCENT\nBloody as hell. And to drink, a\nvanilla coke.\n\nBUDDY\nHow 'bout you, Peggy Sue?\n\nMIA\nI'll have the Durwood Kirby burger \u2013\nbloody \u2013 and a five-dollar shake.\n\nBUDDY\nHow d'ya want that shake, Martin and\nLewis, or Amos and Andy?\n\nMIA\nMartin and Lewis.\n\nVINCENT\nDid you just order a five-dollar\nshake?\n\nMIA\nSure did.\n\nVINCENT\nA shake? Milk and ice cream?\n\nMIA\nUh-huh.\n\nVINCENT\nIt costs five dollars?\n\nBUDDY\nYep.\n\nVINCENT\nYou don't put bourbon in it or\nanything?\n\nBUDDY\nNope.\n\nVINCENT\nJust checking.\n\nBuddy exits.\n\nVincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are\ndancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers,\nand the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing,\nThe Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her\ncustomers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a\nfool.\n\nMIA\nWhaddya think?\n\nVINCENT\nIt's like a wax museum with a pulse\nrate.\n\nVincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling\nhimself a smoke.\n\nAfter a second of watching him \u2013\n\nMIA\nWhat are you doing?\n\nVINCENT\nRollin' a smoke.\n\nMIA\nHere?\n\nVINCENT\nIt's just tobacco.\n\nMIA\nOh. Well in that case, will you roll\nme one, cowboy?\n\nAs he finishes licking it \u2013\n\nVINCENT\nYou can have this one, cowgirl.\n\nHe hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to\nher lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's\nhand. He lights it.\n\nMIA\nThanks.\n\nVINCENT\nThink nothing of it.\n\nHe begins rolling one for himself.\n\nAs this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner,\nmaking everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a\nsquare vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS\nthe skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out\na squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.\n\nBack to Mia and Vincent.\n\nMIA\nMarsellus said you just got back\nfrom Amsterdam.\n\nVINCENT\nSure did. I heard you did a pilot.\n\nMIA\nThat was my fifteen minutes.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat was it?\n\nMIA\nIt was show about a team of female\nsecret agents called \"Fox Force Five.\"\n\nVINCENT\nWhat?\n\nMIA\n\"Fox Force Five.\" Fox, as in we're a\nbunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in\nwe're a force to be reckoned with.\nFive, as in there's one... two ...\nthree... four... five of us. There\nwas a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal\nfrom that show \"Baton Rouge,\" she\nwas the leader. A Japanese one, a\nblack one, a French one and a brunette\none, me.  We all had special skills.\nSommerset had a photographic memory,\nthe Japanese fox was a kung fu master,\nthe black girl was a demolition\nexpert, the French fox' specialty\nwas sex...\n\nVINCENT\nWhat was your specialty?\n\nMIA\nKnives. The character I played, Raven\nMcCoy, her background was she was\nraised by circus performers. So she\ngrew up doing a knife act. According\nto the show, she was the deadliest\nwoman in the world with a knife. But\nbecause she grew up in a circus, she\nwas also something of an acrobat.\nShe could do illusions, she was a\ntrapeze artist \u2013 when you're keeping\nthe world safe from evil, you never\nknow when being a trapeze artist's\ngonna come in handy. And she knew a\nzillion old jokes her grandfather,\nan old vaudevillian, taught her. If\nwe woulda got picked up, they woulda\nworked in a gimmick where every\nepisode I woulda told and ol joke.\n\nVINCENT\nDo you remember any of the jokes?\n\nMIA\nWell I only got the chance to say\none, 'cause we only did one show.\n\nVINCENT\nTell me.\n\nMIA\nNo. It's really corny.\n\nVINCENT\nC'mon, don't be that way.\n\nMIA\nNo. You won't like it and I'll be\nembarrassed.\n\nVINCENT\nYou told it in front of fifty million\npeople and you can't tell it to me?\nI promise I won't laugh.\n\nMIA\n(laughing)\nThat's what I'm afraid of.\n\nVINCENT\nThat's not what I meant and you know\nit.\n\nMIA\nYou're quite the silver tongue devil,\naren't you?\n\nVINCENT\nI meant I wouldn't laugh at you.\n\nMIA\nThat's not what you said Vince. Well\nnow I'm definitely not gonna tell\nya, 'cause it's been built up too\nmuch.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat a gyp.\n\nBuddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around\nthe straw of her shake.\n\nMIA\nYummy!\n\nVINCENT\nCan I have a sip of that? I'd like\nto know what a five-dollar shake\ntastes like.\n\nMIA\nBe my guest.\n\nShe slides the shake over to him.\n\nMIA\nYou can use my straw, I don't have\nkooties.\n\nVincent smiles.\n\nVINCENT\nYeah, but maybe I do.\n\nMIA\nKooties I can handle.\n\nHe takes a sip.\n\nVINCENT\nGoddamn! That's a pretty fuckin'\ngood milk shake.\n\nMIA\nTold ya.\n\nVINCENT\nI don't know if it's worth five\ndollars, but it's pretty fuckin'\ngood.\n\nHe slides the shake back.\n\nThen the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.\n\nMIA\nDon't you hate that?\n\nVINCENT\nWhat?\n\nMIA\nUncomfortable silences. Why do we\nfeel it's necessary to yak about\nbullshit in order to be comfortable?\n\nVINCENT\nI don't know.\n\nMIA\nThat's when you know you found\nsomebody special. When you can just\nshut the fuck up for a minute, and\ncomfortably share silence.\n\nVINCENT\nI don't think we're there yet. But\ndon't feel bad, we just met each\nother.\n\nMIA\nWell I'll tell you what, I'll go to\nthe bathroom and powder my nose,\nwhile you sit here and think of\nsomething to say.\n\nVINCENT\nI'll do that.\n\nINT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nMia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the\nbathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.\n\nMIA\n(imitating Steppenwolf)\nI said goddamn!\n\nINT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nVincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his\neyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.\n\nMia comes back to the table.\n\nMIA\nDon't you love it when you go to the\nbathroom and you come back to find\nyour food waiting for you?\n\nVINCENT\nWe're lucky we got it at all. Buddy\nHolly doesn't seem to be much of a\nwaiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn\nMonroe's section.\n\nMIA\nWhich one, there's two Marilyn\nMonroes.\n\nVINCENT\nNo there's not.\n\nPointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.\n\nVINCENT\nThat's Marilyn Monroe...\n\nThen, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and\ncapri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS \u2013\n\nVINCENT\n... and that's Mamie Van Doren. I\ndon't see Jayne Mansfield, so it\nmust be her night off.\n\nMIA\nPretty smart.\n\nVINCENT\nI have moments.\n\nMIA\nDid ya think of something to say?\n\nVINCENT\nActually, there's something I've\nwanted to ask you about, but you\nseem like a nice person, and I didn't\nwant to offend you.\n\nMIA\nOooohhhh, this doesn't sound like\nmindless, boring, getting-to-know-\nyou chit-chat. This sounds like you\nactually have something to say.\n\nVINCENT\nOnly if you promise not to get\noffended.\n\nMIA\nYou can't promise something like\nthat. I have no idea what you're\ngonna ask. You could ask me what\nyou're gonna ask me, and my natural\nresponse could be to be offended.\nThen, through no fault of my own, I\nwoulda broken my promise.\n\nVINCENT\nThen let's just forget it.\n\nMIA\nThat is an impossibility. Trying to\nforget anything as intriguing as\nthis would be an exercise in futility.\n\nVINCENT\nIs that a fact?\n\nMia nods her head: \"Yes.\"\n\nMIA\nBesides, it's more exciting when you\ndon't have permission.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat do you think about what happened\nto Antwan?\n\nMIA\nWho's Antwan?\n\nVINCENT\nTony Rocky Horror.\n\nMIA\nHe fell out of a window.\n\nVINCENT\nThat's one way to say it. Another\nway is, he was thrown out. Another\nwas is, he was thrown out by\nMarsellus. And even another way is,\nhe was thrown out of a window by\nMarsellus because of you.\n\nMIA\nIs that a fact?\n\nVINCENT\nNo it's not, it's just what I heard.\n\nMIA\nWho told you this?\n\nVINCENT\nThey.\n\nMia and Vincent smile.\n\nMIA\nThey talk a lot, don't they?\n\nVINCENT\nThey certainly do.\n\nMIA\nWell don't be shy Vincent, what\nexactly did they say?\n\nVincent is slow to answer.\n\nMIA\nLet me help you Bashful, did it\ninvolve the F-word?\n\nVINCENT\nNo. They just said Rocky Horror gave\nyou a foot massage.\n\nMIA\nAnd...?\n\nVINCENT\nNo and, that's it.\n\nMIA\nYou heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror\nout of a four-story window because\nhe massaged my feet?\n\nVINCENT\nYeah.\n\nMIA\nAnd you believed that?\n\nVINCENT\nAt the time I was told, it seemed\nreasonable.\n\nMIA\nMarsellus throwing Tony out of a\nfour-story window for giving me a\nfoot massage seemed reasonable?\n\nVINCENT\nNo, it seemed excessive. But that\ndoesn't mean it didn't happen. I\nheard Marsellus is very protective\nof you.\n\nMIA\nA husband being protective of his\nwife is one thing. A husband almost\nkilling another man for touching his\nwife's feet is something else.\n\nVINCENT\nBut did it happen?\n\nMIA\nThe only thing Antwan ever touched\nof mine was my hand, when he shook\nit. I met Anwan once \u2013 at my wedding\n\u2013 then never again.  The truth is,\nnobody knows why Marsellus tossed\nTony Rocky Horror out of that window\nexcept Marsellus and Tony Rocky\nHorror.

The speakers BLAST OUT a high\nenergy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She\ndances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's\novercoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It\nfeels good.\n\nHer hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.\nLike a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco\non some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks\nthe paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a\nlittle too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so\nanyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out\nhis Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,\ntrying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you\nknow, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly\nbrings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,\nthen LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.\n\nThe Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she\ntakes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in\nthe overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something\nelse. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder\ninside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.\nWearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her\nface.\n\nMIA\n(like you would say\nBingo!)\nDisco! Vince, you little cola nut,\nyou've been holding out on me.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nVincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to\nhimself in the mirror.\n\nVINCENT\nOne drink and leave. Don't be rude,\nbut drink your drink quickly, say\ngoodbye, walk out the door, get in\nyour car, and go down the road.\n\nLIVING ROOM\n\nMia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines\non her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred\ndollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the\nfat line.\n\nCLOSEUP \u2013 MIA\n\nHer head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels\nlike it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.\nThen... the rush hits...\n\nBATHROOM\n\nVincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his\ndialogue with the mirror.\n\nVINCENT\n...It's a moral test of yourself,\nwhether or not you can maintain\nloyalty. Because when people are\nloyal to each other, that's very\nmeaningful.\n\nLIVING ROOM\n\nMia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but\nit's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from\nher knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her\nstomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.\n\nBATHROOM\n\nVince continues.\n\nVINCENT\nSo you're gonna go out there, drink\nyour drink, say \"Goodnight, I've had\na very lovely evening,\" go home, and\njack off.  And that's all you're\ngonna do.\n\nNow that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's\nready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of\nthat door. So he goes through it.\n\nLIVING ROOM\n\nWe follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to\nthe living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like\na rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are\ndown her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the\ntightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her\nface are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.\nSlack-jawed.\n\nVINCENT\nOH Jesus Christ!\nJesus Fuckin Christ\nOh Fuck me\n\nVincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.\nBending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck\nto check her pulse. She slightly stirs.\n\nMia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.\n\nVINCENT\n(sounding weird)\nMia! MIA! What the hell happened?\n\nBut she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles,\nbut they're not distinctive enough to be called words.\n\nVincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.\n\nVINCENT\n(to himself)\nI'll be a son-of-a-bitch.\n(to Mia)\nMia! MIA! What did you take? Answer\nme honey, what did you take?\n\nMia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.\n\nVincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the\nrack.\n\nHe goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent\nmakes a beeline to Mia. We follow.\n\nVINCENT\n(yelling to Mia)\nOkay honey, we're getting you on\nyour feet.\n\nHe reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.\n\nVINCENT\nWe're on our feet now, and now we're\ngonna talk out to the car. Here we\ngo, watch us walk.\n\nWe follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-\nunconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.\n\nEXT.

He\nopens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.\n\nLANCE\nWhile I'm doing this, take her shirt\noff and find her heart.\n\nVince rips her blouse open.\n\nJody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.\n\nVINCENT\nDoes it have to be exact?\n\nLANCE\nYeah, it has to be exact! I'm giving\nher an injection in the heart, so I\ngotta exactly hit her in the heart.\n\nVINCENT\nWell, I don't know exactly where her\nheart is, I think it's here.\n\nVince points to Mia's right breast.

Lance hands Vincent the needle.\n\nLANCE\nIt's ready, I'll tell you what to\ndo.\n\nVINCENT\nYou're gonna give her the shot.\n\nLANCE\nNo, you're gonna give her the shot.\n\nVINCENT\nI've never does this before.\n\nLANCE\nI've never done this before either,\nand I ain't starting now.

The day I bring an ODing\nbitch to your place, then I gotta\ngive her the shot.\n\nJody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic\nmarker in her hand.\n\nJODY\nGot it.\n\nVincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes\na big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.\n\nVINCENT\nOkay, what do I do?\n\nLANCE\nWell, you're giving her an injection\nof adrenaline straight to her heart.\nBut she's got a breast plate in front\nof her heart, so you gotta pierce\nthrough that. So what you gotta do\nis bring the needle down in a stabbing\nmotion.\n\nLance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like \"The\nShape\" killing its victims in \"HALLOWEEN\".\n\nVINCENT\nI gotta stab her?\n\nLANCE\nIf you want the needle to pierce\nthrough to her heart, you gotta stab\nher hard.\n\nThen once you do, push down on the plunger.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat happens after that?\n\nLANCE\nI'm curious about that myself.\n\nVINCENT\nThis ain't a fuckin' joke man!\n\nLANCE\nShe's supposed to come out of it\nlike \u2013\n(snaps his fingers)\n\u2013 that.\n\nVincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing\nmotion.\n\nHe looks down on Mia.\n\nMia is fading fast.

BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish,\nstands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to\nher is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force\nofficer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old\nboy.\n\nMOTHER\nButch, stop watching TV a second. We\ngot a special visitor. Now do you\nremember when I told you your daddy\ndies in a P.O.W. camp?\n\nBUTCH (O.S.)\nUh-huh.\n\nMOTHER\nWell this here is Capt. Koons. He\nwas in the P.O.W. camp with Daddy.\n\nCAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and\nbends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's\neyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas\naccent.\n\nCAPT. KOONS\nHello, little man. Boy I sure heard\na bunch about you. See, I was a good\nfriend of your Daddy's. We were in\nthat Hanoi pit of hell over five\nyears together.  Hopefully, you'll\nnever have to experience this\nyourself, but when two men are in a\nsituation like me and your Daddy\nwere, for as long as we were, you\ntake on certain responsibilities of\nthe other. If it had been me who had\nnot made it, Major Coolidge would be\ntalkin' right now to my son Jim. But\nthe way it worked out is I'm talkin'\nto you, Butch. I got somethin' for\nya.\n\nThe Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.\n\nCAPT. KOONS\nThis watch I got here was first\npurchased by your great-granddaddy.\nIt was bought during the First World\nWar in a little general store in\nKnoxville, Tennessee. It was bought\nby private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge\nthe day he set sail for Paris. It\nwas your great-granddaddy's war watch,\nmade by the first company to ever\nmake wrist watches. You see, up until\nthen, people just carried pocket\nwatches. Your great-granddaddy wore\nthat watch every day he was in the\nwar. Then when he had done his duty,\nhe went home to your great-\ngrandmother, took the watch off his\nwrist and put it in an ol' coffee\ncan. And in that can it stayed 'til\nyour grandfather Dane Coolidge was\ncalled upon by his country to go\noverseas and fight the Germans once\nagain. This time they called it World\nWar Two. Your great-granddaddy gave\nit to your granddad for good luck.\nUnfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as\ngood as his old man's. Your granddad\nwas a Marine and he was killed with\nall the other Marines at the battle\nof Wake Island. Your granddad was\nfacing death and he knew it. None of\nthose boys had any illusions about\never leavin' that island alive. So\nthree days before the Japanese took\nthe island, your 22-year old\ngrandfather asked a gunner on an Air\nForce transport named Winocki, a man\nhe had never met before in his life,\nto deliver to his infant son, who he\nhad never seen in the flesh, his\ngold watch. Three days later, your\ngrandfather was dead. But Winocki\nkept his word. After the war was\nover, he paid a visit to your\ngrandmother, delivering to your infant\nfather, his Dad's gold watch. This\nwatch. This watch was on your Daddy's\nwrist when he was shot down over\nHanoi. He was captured and put in a\nVietnamese prison camp. Now he knew\nif the gooks ever saw the watch it'd\nbe confiscated. The way your Daddy\nlooked at it, that watch was your\nbirthright. And he'd be damned if\nand slopeheads were gonna put their\ngreasy yella hands on his boy's\nbirthright. So he hid it in the one\nplace he knew he could hide somethin'.\nHis ass. Five long years, he wore\nthis watch up his ass. Then when he\ndied of dysentery, he gave me the\nwatch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk\nof metal up my ass for two years.\nThen, after seven years, I was sent\nhome to my family. And now, little\nman, I give the watch to you.\n\nCapt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes\ninto FRAME to accept it.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. LOCKER ROOM \u2013 NIGHT\n\nThe 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia:\ntrunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few\nzzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to\nhim, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory,\nhe wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.\n\nHis trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a\nlittle, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to\nbe breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.\n\nKLONDIKE\nIt's time, Butch.\n\nBUTCH\nI'm ready.\n\nKlondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB\noutside.\n\nHe goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch\nhops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him\non with the robe, which says on the back: \"BATTLING BUTCH\nCOOLIDGE\".\n\nThe two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for\nButch.\n\nAs Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit.\nKlondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet,\nempty locker room.\n\nFADE TO BLACK\n\nTITLE CARD:\n\n\"THE GOLD WATCH\"\n\nWe hear over the black and white title:\n\nSPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)\n\u2013 Well Dan, that had to be the\nbloodiest and, hands-down, the most\nbrutal fight this city has ever seen.\n\nThe SOUND of chaos in the b.g.\n\nFADE IN:\n\nEXT.

But it's of\nparamount importance that during the\nsad weeks ahead, the eyes of the\nW.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the \u2013\n\nCLICK \u2013 Esmarelda shuts off the radio.\n\nShe takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in\nthe alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:\n\nEXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nA window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-\nside of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage\ndumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed\nin boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to\nthe dumpster below.\n\nESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.\n\nGym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS\nto the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and\nthrows it to the ground.\n\nINT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nButch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves,\nHOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.\n\nEsmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through\nthe rearview mirror:\n\nESMARELDA\n(Spanish accent)\nAre you the man I was supposed to\npick up?\n\nBUTCH\nIf you're the cab I called, I'm the\nguy you're supposed to pick up.\n\nESMARELDA\nWhere to?\n\nBUTCH\nOutta here.\n\nThe ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.\n\nThe meter is FLIPPED on.\n\nEsmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.\n\nEXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nThe cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet\npavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.\n\nINT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nLocker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through\nthe pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall,\nshutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave\ntakes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by\nthe door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.\n\nVINCENT\nMia. How you doin'?\n\nMIA\nGreat. I never thanked you for the\ndinner.\n\nIn the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table \u2013\ndead.\n\nHis face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is\non his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.\n\nThe huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table,\nhand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support.\nWe still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.\n\nMia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.\n\nMarsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.\n\nMARSELLUS (O.S.)\nWhat'cha got?\n\nENGLISH DAVE\nHe booked.\n\nMARSELLUS (O.S.)\nI'm prepared to scour the earth for\nthis motherfucker. If Butch goes to\nIndo China, I want a nigger hidin'\nin a bowl of rice, ready to pop a\ncap in his ass.\n\nENGLISH DAVE\nI'll take care of it.\n\nINT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nButch gets one of his boxing gloves off.\n\nEsmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.\n\nHe tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't\nfind the roll bar.\n\nBUTCH\nHey, how do I open the window back\nhere?\n\nESMARELDA\nI have to do it.\n\nShe presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch\ntosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying\nthe other one.\n\nEsmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.\n\nESMARELDA\nHey, mister?\n\nBUTCH\n(still working on the\nglove)\nWhat?\n\nESMARELDA\nYou were in that fight? The fight on\nthe radio \u2013 you're the fighter?\n\nAs he tosses his other glove out the window.\n\nBUTCH\nWhatever gave you that idea?\n\nESMARELDA\nNo c'mon, you're him, I know you're\nhim, tell me you're him.\n\nBUTCH\n(drying himself with\na gym towel)\nI'm him.\n\nESMARELDA\nYou killed the other boxing man.\n\nBUTCH\nHe's dead?\n\nESMARELDA\nThe radio said he was dead.\n\nHe finished wiping himself down.\n\nBUTCH\n(to himself)\nSorry 'bout that, Floyd.\n\nHe tosses the towel out the window.\n\nSilence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.\n\nESMARELDA\nWhat does it feel like?\n\nBUTCH\n(finds his shirt)\nWhat does what feel like?\n\nESMARELDA\nKilling a man. Beating another man\nto death with your bare hands.\n\nButch pulls on his tee-shirt.\n\nBUTCH\nAre you some kinda weirdo?\n\nESMARELDA\nNo, it's a subject I have much\ninterest in. You are the first person\nI ever met who has killed somebody.\nSo, what was it like to kill a man?\n\nBUTCH\nTell ya what, you give me one of\nthem cigarettes, I'll give you an\nanswer.\n\nEsmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.\n\nESMARELDA\nDeal!\n\nButch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road,\npasses a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not\nlooking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in\nit.\n\nButch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.\n\nHe takes a long drag.\n\nBUTCH\nSo...\n\nHe looks at her license.\n\nBUTCH\n...Esmarelda Villalobos \u2013 is that\nMexican?\n\nESMARELDA\nThe name is Spanish, but I'm\nColumbian.\n\nBUTCH\nIt's a very pretty name.\n\nESMARELDA\nIt mean \"Esmarelda of the wolves.\"\n\nBUTCH\nThat's one hell of a name you got\nthere, sister.\n\nESMARELDA\nThank you. And what is your name?\n\nBUTCH\nButch.\n\nESMARELDA\nButch. What does it mean?\n\nBUTCH\nI'm an American, our names don't\nmean shit. Anyway, moving right along,\nwhat is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?\n\nESMARELDA\nI want to know what it feels like to\nkill a man \u2013\n\nBUTCH\n\u2013 I couldn't tell ya. I didn't know\nhe was dead 'til you told me he was\ndead. Now I know he's dead, do you\nwanna know how I feel about it?\n\nEsmarelda nods her head: \"yes.\"\n\nBUTCH\nI don't feel the least little bit\nbad.\n\nEXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nWe DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.\n\nBUTCH\n(into phone)\nWhat'd I tell ya, soon as the word\ngot out a fix was in, the odds would\nbe outta control. Hey, if he was a\nbetter fighter he's be alive. If he\nnever laced up his gloves in the\nfirst place, which he never shoulda\ndone, he'd be alive. Enough about\nthe poor unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let's\ntalk about the rich and prosperous\nMr. Butch.  How many bookies you\nspread it around with?\n\n(PAUSE)\nEight? How long to collect?\n(pause)\nSo by tomorrow evening, you'll have\nit all?\n(pause)\nGood news Scotty, real good news \u2013 I\nunderstand a few stragglers aside.\nMe an'  Fabienne're gonna leave in\nthe morning. It should take us a\ncouple days to get into Knoxville.\nNext time we see each other, it'll\nbe on Tennessee time.\n\nButch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to\ntake him wherever he wants to go.\n\nBUTCH\n(to himself in French\nwith English subtitles)\nFabienne my love, our adventure\nbegins.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nEsmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain\nhas stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out,\nnow fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic\njacket. He leans in the driver's side window.\n\nESMARELDA\nForty-five sixty.\n\nHanding her the money.\n\nBUTCH\nMerci beaucoup. And here's a little\nsomething for the effort.\n\nButch holds up a hundred dollar bill.\n\nEsmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds\nit out of reach.\n\nBUTCH\nNow if anybody should ask you about\nwho your fare was tonight, what're\nyou gonna tell 'em?\n\nESMARELDA\nThe truth. Three well-dressed,\nslightly toasted, Mexicans.\n\nHe gives her the bill.\n\nBUTCH\nBon soir, Esmarelda.\n\nESMARELDA\n(in Spanish)\nSleep well, Butch.\n\nHe tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away.\nShe drives off.\n\nINT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX) \u2013 NIGHT\n\nButch enters and turns on the light.\n\nLying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to\nus is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.\n\nFABIENNE\nKeep the light off.\n\nButch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.\n\nBUTCH\nIs that better, sugar pop?\n\nFABIENNE\nOui. Hard day at the office?\n\nBUTCH\nPretty hard. I got into a fight.\n\nFABIENNE\nPoor baby. Can we make spoons?\n\nButch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.\n\nWhen Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in\nbabytalk.\n\nFABIENNE\nI was looking at myself in the mirror.\n\nBUTCH\nUh-huh?\n\nFABIENNE\nI wish I had a pot.\n\nBUTCH\nYou were lookin' in the mirror and\nyou wish you had some pot?\n\nFABIENNE\nA pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are\nsexy.\n\nBUTCH\nWell you should be happy, 'cause you\ndo.\n\nFABIENNE\nShut up, Fatso! I don't have a pot!\nI have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna\nwhen she did \"Lucky Star,\" it's not\nthe same thing.\n\nBUTCH\nI didn't realize there was a\ndifference between a tummy and a pot\nbelly.\n\nFABIENNE\nThe difference is huge.\n\nBUTCH\nYou want me to have a pot?\n\nFABIENNE\nNo. Pot bellies make a man look either\noafish, or like a gorilla. But on a\nwoman, a pot belly is very sexy. The\nrest of you is normal. Normal face,\nnormal legs, normal hips, normal\nass, but with a big, perfectly round\npot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a\ntee-shirt two sizes too small to\naccentuate it.\n\nBUTCH\nYou think guys would find that\nattractive?\n\nFABIENNE\nI don't give a damn what men find\nattractive. It's unfortunate what we\nfind pleasing to the touch and\npleasing to the eye is seldom the\nsame.\n\nBUTCH\nIf you a pot belly, I'd punch you in\nit.\n\nFABIENNE\nYou'd punch me in my belly?\n\nBUTCH\nRight in the belly.\n\nFABIENNE\nI'd smother you. I'd drop it on your\nright on your face 'til you couldn't\nbreathe.\n\nBUTCH\nYou'd do that to me?\n\nFABIENNE\nYes!\n\nBUTCH\nDid you get everything, sugar pop?\n\nFABIENNE\nYes, I did.\n\nBUTCH\nGood job.\n\nFABIENNE\nDid everything go as planned?\n\nBUTCH\nYou didn't listen to the radio?\n\nFABIENNE\nI never listen to your fights. Were\nyou the winner?\n\nBUTCH\nI won alright.\n\nFABIENNE\nAre you still retiring?\n\nBUTCH\nSure am.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhat about the man you fought?\n\nBUTCH\nFloyd retired too.\n\nFABIENNE\n(smiling)\nReally?! He won't be fighting no\nmore?!\n\nBUTCH\nNot no more.\n\nFABIENNE\nSo it all worked out in the finish?\n\nBUTCH\nWe ain't at the finish, baby.\n\nFabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.\n\nFABIENNE\nWe're in a lot of danger, aren't we?\n\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nIf they find us, they'll kill us,\nwon't they?\n\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nBut they won't find us, will they?\n\nButch nods his head: \"no.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nDo you still want me to go with you?\n\nButch nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nI don't want to be a burden or a\nnuisance -\n\nButch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her\ncrotch.\n\nFabienne reacts.\n\nFABIENNE\nSay it!\n\nBUTCH\nFabienne, I want you to be with me.\n\nFABIENNE\nForever?\n\nBUTCH\n...and ever.\n\nFabienne lies her head back.\n\nButch continues to massage her crotch.\n\nFABIENNE\nDo you love me?\n\nBUTCH\nOui.\n\nFABIENNE\nButch? Will you give me oral pleasure?\n\nButch kisses her on the mouth.\n\nBUTCH\nWill you kiss it?\n\nShe nods her head: \"yes.\"\n\nFABIENNE\nBut you first.\n\nButch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral\npleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.\n\nFABIENNE\n(in French, with\nEnglish subtitles)\nButch my love, the adventure begins.\n\nFADE TO BLACK\n\nFADE UP:\n\nMOTEL ROOM\n\nSame motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in\nthe bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We\nsee Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow\nher up.\n\nShe's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower\nwashing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the\nsmoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom.\nButch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his\nhead out.\n\nBUTCH\nI think I cracked a rib.\n\nFABIENNE\nGiving me oral pleasure?\n\nBUTCH\nNo retard, from the fight.\n\nFABIENNE\nDon't call me retard.\n\nBUTCH\n(in a Mongoloid voice)\nMy name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!\n\nFABIENNE\nShut up fuck head! I hate that\nMongoloid voice.\n\nBUTCH\nOkay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it\nback!  Can I have a towel please,\nMiss Beautiful Tulip.\n\nFABIENNE\nOh I like that, I like being called\na tulip. Tulip is much better than\nMongoloid.\n\nShe finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban\non her head.\n\nBUTCH\nI didn't call you a Mongoloid, I\ncalled you a retard, but I took it\nback.\n\nShe hands him a towel.\n\nBUTCH\nMerci beaucoup.\n\nFABIENNE\nButch?\n\nBUTCH\n(drying his head)\nYes, lemon pie.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhere are we going to go?\n\nBUTCH\nI'm not sure yet. Wherever you want.\nWe're gonna get a lot of money from\nthis. But it ain't gonna be so much,\nwe can live like hogs in the fat\nhouse forever. I was thinking we\ncould go somewhere in the South\nPacific. The kinda money we'll have'll\ncarry us a long way down there.\n\nFABIENNE\nSo if we wanted, we could live in\nBora Bora?\n\nBUTCH\nYou betcha. And if after awhile you\ndon't dig Bora Bora, then we can\nmove over to Tahiti or Mexico.\n\nFABIENNE\nBut I do not speak Spanish.\n\nBUTCH\nYou don't speak Bora Boran either.\nBesides, Mexican is easy: Donde esta\nel zapataria?\n\nFABIENNE\nWhat does that mean?\n\nBUTCH\nWhere's the shoe store?\n\nFABIENNE\nDonde esta el zapataria?\n\nBUTCH\nExcellent pronunciation. You'll be\nmy little mama ceta in no time.\n\nButch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes\nher teeth.\n\nButch keeps on from the other room.\n\nBUTCH (O.S.)\nQue hora es?\n\nFABIENNE\nQue hora es?\n\nBUTCH (O.S.)\nWhat time is it?\n\nFABIENNE\nWhat time is it?\n\nBUTCH (O.S.)\nTime for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.\n\nFabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or\ntwo, then she remember something.\n\nFABIENNE\nButch.\n\nShe walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only\nto find him sound asleep in bed.\n\nShe looks at him for a moment.\n\nFABIENNE\nForget it.\n\nShe exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the\nWIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.\n\nFADE TO BLACK\n\nFADE UP:\n\nMOTEL ROOM \u2013 MORNING\n\nSAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still\nasleep in bed.\n\nFabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the\nbathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still\nwears the terry cloth robe from the night before.\n\nON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking\non the entire Vietnamese army in the film \"THE LOSERS\".\n\nButch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing\nhim.\n\nHis start startles Fabienne.\n\nFABIENNE\nMerde! You startled me. Did you have\na bad dream?\n\nButch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to\nfocus.\n\nButch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV\nHell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat are you watching?\n\nFABIENNE\nA motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the\nname.\n\nBUTCH\nAre you watchin' it?\n\nFabienne enters the room.\n\nFABIENNE\nIn a way. Why? Would you like for me\nto switch it off?\n\nBUTCH\nWould you please?\n\nShe reaches over and turns off the TV.\n\nBUTCH\nIt's a little too early in the morning\nfor explosions and war.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhat was it about?\n\nBUTCH\nHow should I know, you were the one\nwatchin' it.\n\nFabienne laughs.\n\nFABIENNE\nNo, imbecile, what was your dream\nabout?\n\nBUTCH\nOh, I... don't remember. It's really\nrare I remember a dream.\n\nFABIENNE\nYou just woke up from it.\n\nBUTCH\nFabienne, I'm not lying to you, I\ndon't remember.\n\nFABIENNE\nWell, let's look at the grumpy man\nin the morning. I didn't say you\nwere lying, it's just odd you don't\nremember your dreams. I always\nremember mine. Did you know you talk\nin your sleep?\n\nBUTCH\nI don't talk in my sleep, do I talk\nin my sleep?\n\nFABIENNE\nYou did last night.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat did I say?\n\nLaying on top of him.\n\nFABIENNE\nI don't know. I couldn't understand\nyou.\n\nShe kisses Butch.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhy don't you get up and we'll get\nsome breakfast at that breakfast\nplace with the pancakes.\n\nBUTCH\nOne more kiss and I'll get up.\n\nFabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.\n\nFABIENNE\nSatisfied?\n\nBUTCH\nYep.\n\nFABIENNE\nThen get up, lazy bones.\n\nButch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of\nthe suitcase that Fabienne brought.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat time is it?\n\nFABIENNE\nAlmost nine in the morning. What\ntime does our train arrive?\n\nBUTCH\nEleven.\n\nFABIENNE\nI'm gonna order a big plate of\nblueberry pancakes with maple syrup,\neggs over easy, and five sausages.\n\nBUTCH\n(surprised at her\npotential appetite)\nAnything to drink with that?\n\nButch is finished dressing.\n\nFABIENNE\n(referring to his\nclothes)\nOh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a\ntall glass or orange juice and a\nblack cup of coffee. After that, I'm\ngoing to have a slice of pie.\n\nAs he goes through the suitcase.\n\nBUTCH\nPie for breakfast?\n\nFABIENNE\nAny time of the day is a good time\nfor pie. Blueberry pie to go with\nthe pancakes. And on top, a thin\nslice of melted cheese \u2013\n\nBUTCH\n\u2013 where's my watch?\n\nFABIENNE\nIt's there.\n\nBUTCH\nNo, it's not. It's not here.\n\nFABIENNE\nHave you looked?\n\nBy now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.\n\nBUTCH\nYes I've fuckin' looked!!\n\nHe's now throwing clothes.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat the fuck do you think I'm doing?!\nAre you sure you got it?\n\nFabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.\n\nFABIENNE\nUhhh... yes... beside the table drawer\n\u2013\n\nBUTCH\n\u2013 on the little kangaroo.\n\nFABIENNE\nYes, it was on your little kangaroo.\n\nBUTCH\nWell it's not here!\n\nFABIENNE\n(on the verge of tears)\nWell it should be!\n\nBUTCH\nOh it most definitely should be here,\nbut it's not. So where is it?\n\nFabienne is crying and scared.\n\nButch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more\nmenacing.\n\nBUTCH\nFabienne, that was my father's fuckin'\nwatch. You know what my father went\nthrough to git me that watch?... I\ndon't wanna get into it right now...\nbut he went through a lot. Now all\nthis other shit, you coulda set on\nfire, but I specifically reminded\nyou not to forget my father's watch.\nNow think, did you get it?\n\nFABIENNE\nI believe so...\n\nBUTCH\nYou believe so? You either did, or\nyou didn't, now which one is it?\n\nFABIENNE\nThen I did.\n\nBUTCH\nAre you sure?\n\nFABIENNE\n(shaking)\nNo.\n\nButch freaks out, he punches the air.\n\nFabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the\nmotel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.\n\nFabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.\n\nButch looks toward her, suddenly calm.\n\nBUTCH\n(to Fabienne)\nNo! It's not your fault.\n(he approached her)\nYou left it at the apartment.\n\nHe bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.\n\nHe touches her hand, she flinches.\n\nBUTCH\nIf you did leave it at the apartment,\nit's not your fault. I had you bring\na bunch of stuff. I reminded you\nabout it, but I didn't illustrate\nhow personal the watch was to me. If\nall I gave a fuck about was my watch,\nI should've told you. You ain't a\nmind reader.\n\nHe kisses her hand. Then rises.\n\nFabienne is still sniffling.\n\nButch goes to the closet.\n\nFABIENNE\nI'm sorry.\n\nButch puts on his high school jacket.\n\nBUTCH\nDon't be. It just means I won't be\nable to eat breakfast with you.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhy does it mean that?\n\nBUTCH\nBecause I'm going back to my apartment\nto get my watch.\n\nFABIENNE\nWon't the gangsters be looking for\nyou there?\n\nBUTCH\nThat's what I'm gonna find out. If\nthey are, and I don't think I can\nhandle it, I'll split.\n\nRising from the floor.\n\nFABIENNE\nI was so dreadful. I saw your watch,\nI thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.\n\nButch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.\n\nBUTCH\nDon't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing\nyou could ever do would make me\npermanently angry at you.\n(pause)\nI love you, remember?\n(he digs some money\nout of his wallet)\nNow here's some money, order those\npancakes and have a great breakfast.\n\nFABIENNE\nDon't go.\n\nBUTCH\nI'll be back before you can say,\nblueberry pie.\n\nFABIENNE\nBlueberry pie.\n\nBUTCH\nWell maybe not that fast, but fast.\nOkay?  Okay?\n\nFABIENNE\nOkay.\n\nHe kisses her once more and heads for the door.\n\nBUTCH\nBye-bye, sugar pop.\n\nFABIENNE\nBye.\n\nBUTCH\nI'm gonna take your Honda.\n\nFABIENNE\nOkay.\n\nAnd with that, he's out the door.\n\nFabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.\n\nINT. HONDA (MOVING) \u2013 DAY\n\nButch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his\nfists as he drives down the street.\n\nBUTCH\nOf all the fuckin' things she coulda\nforgot, she forgets my father's watch.\nI specifically reminded her not to\nforget it. \"Bedside table \u2013 on the\nkangaroo.\" I said the words: \"Don't\nforget my father's watch.\"\n\nEXT. CITY STREET \u2013 DAY\n\nThe little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is\nlittle engine will take it.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nA parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the\narrow pointing at one hour.\n\nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER \u2013 DAY\n\nButch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a\ncouple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before\nhe goes boppin' through the front door.\n\nEXT. ALLEY \u2013 DAY\n\nButch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,\nthen he discreetly glances out.\n\nEXT. STREET \u2013 BUTCH'S APARTMENT \u2013 DAY\n\nEverything seems normal. More or less the right number of\ncars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of\nplace. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.\nBasically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of\nButch's home.\n\nButch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.\n\nButch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He\ncrosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.\n\nAcross the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a\ncombination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign\nsticks up in the air, with the name \"Teriyaki Donut\" and a\ngraphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.\n\nEXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD \u2013 DAY\n\nButch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment\nbuilding. Once again, everything appears normal \u2013 the laundry\nroom, the pool, his apartment door \u2013 nothing appears\ndisturbed.\n\nButch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.\nHe steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.\n\nButch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening\nit.\n\nINT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT \u2013 DAY\n\nHis apartment hasn't been touched.\n\nHe cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick\nlook around. Obviously, no one is there.\n\nButch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the\nrefrigerator.\n\nHe takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.\n\nWith carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he\ngoes to the bedroom.\n\nHis bedroom is like the rest of the apartment \u2013 neat, clean\nand anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a\nfew boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue\nof \"Ring Magazine\" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of\nJerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.\n\nSure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On\nthe bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.\n\nHe walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He\nopens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting\ndown the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and\nputs them in the toaster.\n\nButch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.\n\nWhat he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun\nwith a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.\n\nBUTCH\n(softly)\nHoly shit.\n\nHe picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines\nit.\n\nThen... a toilet FLUSHES.\n\nButch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to\nthe kitchen. There is someone behind it.\n\nLike a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not\nknowing what to do.\n\nThe bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the\nbathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book\n\"MODESTY BLAISE\" by Peter O'Donnell.\n\nVincent and Butch lock eyes.\n\nVincent freezes.\n\nButch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's\ndirection.\n\nNeither man opens his mouth.\n\nThen... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.\n\nThat's all the situation needed.\n\nButch's finger HITS the trigger.\n\nMUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.\n\nVincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets\nSIMULTANEOUSLY \u2013 LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him\nthrough the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door\nat the end of the bathroom.\n\nBy the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent\nis annihilated.\n\nButch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look\ngoes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once\nVincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.\n\nWith the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61\nback on the kitchen counter.\n\nThen he exits the apartment, quickly.\n\nEXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD \u2013 DAY\n\nButch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the\ncourtyard...\n\n...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...\n\n...goes through the alley...\n\n...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.\n\nEXT. HONDA \u2013 DAY\n\nButch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide\nsmile of a survivor breaks across his face.\n\nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET \u2013 DAY\n\nThe Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his\napartment building.\n\nINT. HONDA \u2013 DAY\n\nButch looks out the window at his former home.\n\nBUTCH\nThat's how you're gonna beat 'em,\nButch.  They keep underestimatin'\nya.\n\nThis makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips\na tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he\nSINGS along with it.\n\nHe drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on\nthe corner across from Teriyaki Donut.\n\nButch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we\nsee:\n\nTHROUGH THE WINDSHIELD\n\nThe big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,\ncarrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam\ncups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street\nin front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see\nMarsellus clearly.\n\nLaughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front\nof him.\n\nWhen Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances\nto his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!\n\nDOUBLE-TAKE: \"Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?\"\n\nButch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question.\nHe STOMPS on the gas pedal.\n\nThe little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts\nand the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.\n\nButch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold\nCamaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending\nit up on the sidewalk.\n\nButch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what\nat one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his\nnostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play.\nA PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.\n\nPEDESTRIAN\nJesus, are you okay?\n\nButch look at him, spaced-out.\n\nBUTCH\nI guess.\n\nMarsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS\ngather around the body.\n\nGAWKER #1\n(to the others)\nHe's dead! He's dead!\n\nThis jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.\n\nTWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.\n\nThe woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.\n\nGAWKER #2\nIf you need a witness in court, I'll\nbe glad to help. He was a drunken\nmaniac. He hit you and crashed into\nthat car.\n\nMARSELLUS\n(still incoherent)\nWho?\n\nGAWKER #2\n(pointing at Butch)\nHim.\n\nMarsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge\ndown the street, looking a shambles.\n\nMARSELLUS\nWell, I'll be damned.\n\nThe big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back\naway.\n\nMarsellus starts moving toward Butch.\n\nButch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward\nhim.\n\nBUTCH\nSacre bleu.\n\nMarsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt,\nshaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.\n\nHe HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,\nscreaming.\n\nLOOKY-LOO WOMAN\nOh my God, I've been shot!\n\nThat's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.\n\nMarsellus RUNS after him.\n\nThe CROWD looks agape.\n\nButch is in a mad, limping RUN.\n\nThe big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.\n\nButch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a\nsign that reads \"MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP\".\n\nINT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP \u2013 DAY\n\nMAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter\nof his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of\nButch RACES into his world.\n\nMAYNARD\nCan I help you wit' somethin'?\n\nBUTCH\nShut up!\n\nButch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands\nnext to the door.\n\nMAYNARD\nNow you just wait one goddamn minute\n\u2013\n\nBefore Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in.\nHe doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist\nin Marsellus' face.\n\nThe gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man\nFALLS FLAT on his back.\n\nOutside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.\n\nButch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in\nthe face.\n\nButch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold\nof his middle finger.\n\nBUTCH\nSo you like chasing people, huh?\n\nHe BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch\nthen places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS\nback the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to\nshield the splatter.\n\nBUTCH\nWell guess what, big man, you caught\nme \u2013\n\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\n\u2013 hold it right there, godammit!\n\nButch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a\npumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.\n\nBUTCH\nLook mister, this ain't any of your\nbusiness \u2013\n\nMAYNARD\n\u2013 I'm makin' it my business! Now\ntoss that gun!\n\nButch does.\n\nMAYNARD\nNow you on top, stand up and come to\nthe counter.\n\nButch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he\ngets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face\nwith the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.\n\nAfter Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on\nthe counter and moves to the telephone.\n\nMarsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily\nwatches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on\nthe line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.\n\nMAYNARD\nZed? It's Maynard. The spider just\ncaught a coupl'a flies.\n\nMarsellus passes out.\n\nFADE TO BLACK\n\nFADE UP:\n\nINT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM \u2013 DAY\n\nTWO SHOT \u2013 BUTCH AND MARSELLUS\n\nThey are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are\ntwo S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and\na little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are\nunconscious.\n\nMaynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both\nguys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two\nprisoners look up at their captors.\n\nMaynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one\nhand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in\nhis belt.\n\nMAYNARD\nNobody kills anybody in my place of\nbusiness except me or Zed.\n\nA BUZZER buzzes.\n\nMAYNARD\nThat's Zed.\n\nWithout saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs\nthat lead to red curtains and goes through them.\n\nWE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed\ninside the store.\n\nButch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of\nthe pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking\nin their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other,\nall traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both\nshare at what they've gotten themselves into.\n\nMaynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even\nmore intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.\nThe two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is\na vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and\nstands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a\nlong time, then says:\n\nZED\n(to Maynard)\nYou said you waited for me?\n\nMAYNARD\nI did.\n\nZED\nThen how come they're all beat up?\n\nMAYNARD\nThey did that to each other. They\nwas fightin' when they came in. This\none was gonna shoot that one.\n\nZED\n(to Butch)\nYou were gonna shoot him?\n\nButch makes no reply.\n\nZED\nHey, is Grace gonna be okay in front\nof this place?\n\nMAYNARD\nYeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?\n\nZED\nNo, it's Thursday.\n\nMAYNARD\nThen she'll be fine.\n\nZED\nBring out The Gimp.\n\nMAYNARD\nI think The Gimp's sleepin'.\n\nZED\nWell, I guess you'll just wake 'em\nup then, won't you?\n\nMaynard opens a trap door in the floor.\n\nMAYNARD\n(yelling in the hole)\nWake up!\n\nMaynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a\nleash.\n\nHe gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises\nTHE GIMP.\n\nThe Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black\nleather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs\nhere and there on the body. On his head is a black leather\nmask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth.\nThey keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large\ndog.\n\nZed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners,\nthen lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed,\nthen backs away.\n\nMAYNARD\n(to The Gimp)\nDown!\n\nThe Gimp gets on its knees.\n\nMaynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.\n\nMAYNARD\nWho's first?\n\nZED\nI ain't fer sure yet.\n\nThen with his little finger, Zed does a silent \"Eenie, meany,\nminey, moe... \" just his mouth mouthing the words and his\nfinger going back and forth between the two.\n\nButch are Marsellus are terrified.\n\nMaynard looks back and forth at the victims.\n\nThe Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.\n\nZed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving\nleft to right, then it stops.\n\nTWO SHOT \u2013 BUTCH AND MARSELLUS\n\nAfter a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on\nMarsellus.\n\nZed stands up.\n\nZED\nWanna do it here?\n\nMAYNARD\nNaw, drag big boy to Russell's old\nroom.\n\nZed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old\nroom.\n\nRussell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the\nmisfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop.\nWhatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and\nZed because his old room, a back room in the back of the\nback room, is empty.\n\nAs Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before\nhe disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.\n\nMAYNARD\n(to The Gimp)\nUp!\n\nThe Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on\nthe ceiling.\n\nMAYNARD\nKeep an eye on this one.\n\nThe Gimp bows its head: \"yes.\" Maynard disappears into\nRussell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because\nsuddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.\n\nButch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath\nthe mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history\nof comedy.\n\nFrom behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:\n\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\nWhoa, this boy's got a bit of fight\nin 'em!\n\nWe the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.\n\nZED (O.S.)\nYou wanna fight? You wanna fight?\nGood, I like to fight!\n\nButch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic,\nhurriedly struggles to get free.\n\nThe Gimp is laughing wildly.\n\nThe ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.\n\nThe Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:\n\nMAYNARD (O.S.)\nThat's it... that's it boy, you're\ngoin' fine. Oooooooh, just like\nthat... that's good.\n(grunting faster)\nStay still... stay still goddamn ya!\nZed goddammit, git over here and\nhold 'em!\n\nButch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite\neasily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it\nwere never connected by a bolt.\n\nThe Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.\n\nTHE GIMP\nHuhng?\n\nThe Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook.\nHe tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles\nand grunts.\n\nButch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S\nPUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making\nhim fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash\nattached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then\nsilently makes his way through the red curtains.\n\nINT. PAWNSHOP \u2013 DAY\n\nButch sneaks to the door.\n\nOn the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected\nto the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he\nstops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their\nway with Marsellus.\n\nButch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in\na situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the\npawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in\nwith.\n\nHe picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards\nit: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks\nabout it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large\nLouisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots\nwhat he's been looking for:\n\nA Samurai sword.\n\nIt hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the\nwall, next to a neon \"DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER\" sign.\nButch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its\nsheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten\nin the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his\nthumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not\non your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems\nmade to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the\nsword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears\nthrough the red curtains to take care of business.\n\nINT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM \u2013 DAY\n\nButch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.\n\nSodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind\nthe closed door that leads to Russell's old room.\n\nINT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM \u2013 DAY\n\nButch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It\nswings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched\npositions.\n\nZed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden\nhorse.\n\nMaynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.\n\nMaynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up\nbehind him with the sword.\n\nMiserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus,\nred ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see\nButch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.\n\nBUTCH\nHey hillbilly.\n\nMaynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.\n\nButch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across\nthe front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on\nZed.\n\nMaynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.\n\nButch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword\nbehind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing\nthe blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.\n\nZed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go\nfrom the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic,\nwhich lies within reach.\n\nButch's eyes follow Zed's.\n\nBUTCH\nYou want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.\n\nZed's hand inches toward the weapon.\n\nButch GRIPS the sword tighter.\n\nZed studies Butch.\n\nButch looks hard at Zed.\n\nThen a VOICE says:\n\nMARSELLUS (O.S.)\nStep aside, Butch.\n\nButch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,\nholding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.\n\nKABOOM!!!!\n\nZed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.\n\nMarsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the\nused shotgun shell.\n\nButch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:\n\nBUTCH\nYou okay?\n\nMARSELLUS\nNaw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from\nokay!\n\nLong pause.\n\nBUTCH\nWhat now?\n\nMARSELLUS\nWhat now? Well let me tell you what\nnow.  I'm gonna call a couple pipe-\nhittin' niggers, who'll go to work\non homes here with a pair of pliers\nand a blow torch.\n(to Zed)\nHear me talkin' hillbilly boy?! I\nain't through with you by a damn\nsight. I'm gonna git Medieval on\nyour ass.\n\nBUTCH\nI meant what now, between me and\nyou?\n\nMARSELLUS\nOh, that what now? Well, let me tell\nya what now between me an' you. There\nis no me an' you. Not no more.\n\nBUTCH\nSo we're cool?\n\nMARSELLUS\nYeah man, we're cool. One thing I\nask \u2013 two things I ask: Don't tell\nnobody about this. This shit's between\nme and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-\nthe-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-\nagonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It\nain't nobody else's business. Two:\nleave town. Tonight. Right now. And\nwhen you're gone, stay gone.  You've\nlost your Los Angeles privileges.\nDeal?\n\nBUTCH\nDeal.\n\nThe two men shake hands, then hug one another.\n\nMARSELLUS\nGo on now, get your ass outta here.\n\nButch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.\n\nMarsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.\n\nMARSELLUS\n(into the phone)\nHello Mr. Wolf, it's Marsellus. Gotta\nbit of a situation.\n\nEXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP \u2013 DAY\n\nButch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He\nlooks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment,\nZed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has\nthe name \"GRACE\" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys\nwith the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES\nto life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.\nButch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.\n\nWE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...\n\nINT.

I'll wait\nfor you outside.\n\nButch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the\nmotel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she\nsees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhere did you get this motorcycle?\n\nBUTCH\n(he kick-starts it)\nIt's a chopper, baby, hop on.\n\nFabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.\n\nFABIENNE\nWhat happened to my Honda?\n\nBUTCH\nSorry baby, I crashed the Honda.\n\nFABIENNE\nYou're hurt?\n\nBUTCH\nI might've broke my nose, no biggie.\nHop on.\n\nShe doesn't move.\n\nButch looks at her.\n\nBUTCH\nHoney, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!\n\nFabienne starts to cry.\n\nButch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the\nbike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her\nhand.\n\nBUTCH\nI'm sorry, baby-love.\n\nFABIENNE\n(crying)\nYou were gone so long, I started to\nthink dreadful thoughts.\n\nBUTCH\nI'm sorry I worried you, sweetie.\nEverything's fine.

Vincent takes his place at\nthe sink.\n\nVINCENT\nJust tell I'm not to be abusive. He\nkinda freaked out back there when he\nsaw Marvin.\n\nJULES\nPut yourself in his position.

Blood's real hard to\nget off. Maybe if he had some Lava,\nI coulda done a better job.\n\nJULES\nI used the same soap you did and\nwhen I dried my hands, the towel\ndidn't look like a fuckin' Maxie\npad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who\ncares? But it's shit like this that's\ngonna bring this situation to a boil.\nIf he were to come in here and see\nthat towel like that... I'm tellin'\nyou Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause\nif I gotta get in to it with Jimmie\non account of you... Look, I ain't\nthreatenin' you, I respect you an'\nall, just don't put me in that\nposition.\n\nJULES\nJules, you ask me nice like that, no\nproblem. He's your friend, you handle\nhim.\n\nINT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN \u2013 MORNING\n\nThree men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug\nof coffee.

Now don't you\nunderstand that if Bonnie comes home\nand finds a dead body in her house,\nI'm gonna get divorced. No marriage\ncounselor, no trial separation \u2013\nfuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna\nget fuckin' divorced. The last time\nme an' Bonnie talked about this shit\nwas gonna be the last time me an'\nBonnie talked about this shit.

JIMMIE'S BEDROOM \u2013 MORNING\n\nJules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.\n\nJULES\nYou got to appreciate what an\nexplosive element this Bonnie\nsituation is. If she comes home from\na hard day's work and finds a bunch\nof gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta'\nshit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin'\nwhat she's apt to do.\n\nMARSELLUS\nI've grasped that, Jules. All I'm\ndoin' is contemplating the \"ifs.\"\n\nJULES\nI don't wanna hear about no\nmotherfuckin' \"ifs.\"What I wanna\nhear from your ass is: \"you ain't\ngot no problems, Jules.

HOTEL SUITE \u2013 MORNING\n\nThe CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite\ninto the main area.

The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing:\nSitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the\ntuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka \"THE WOLF\".

If I was informed\ncorrectly, the clock is ticking, is\nthat right, Jimmie?\n\nJIMMIE\n100%.\n\nTHE WOLF\nYour wife, Bonnie...\n(refers to his pad)\n...comes home at 9:30 in the AM, is\nthat correct?\n\nJIMMIE\nUh-huh.\n\nTHE WOLF\nI was led to believe if she comes\nhome and finds us here, she wouldn't\nappreciate it none too much.\n\nJIMMIE\nShe won't at that.\n\nTHE WOLF\nThat gives us forty minutes to get\nthe fuck outta Dodge, which, if you\ndo what I say when I say it, should\nby plenty. Now you got a corpse in a\ncar, minus a head, in a garage. Take\nme to it.\n\nINT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE \u2013 MORNING\n\nThe three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car.

Don't get me out on the\nroad and I find out the brake lights\ndon't work.\n\nJULES\nHey man, as far as I know, the\nmotherfucker's tip-top.\n\nTHE WOLF\nGood enough, let's go back to the\nkitchen.\n\nINT. KITCHEN \u2013 MORNING\n\nJimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.\n\nTHE WOLF\nThank you, Jimmie.\n\nHe takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the\nthree men the plan of action.\n\nTHE WOLF\nOkay first thing, you two.\n(meaning Jules and\nVincent)\nTake the body, stick it in the trunk.\nNow Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty\ndomesticated house. That would lead\nme to believe that in the garage or\nunder the sink, you got a bunch of\ncleansers and cleaners and shit like\nthat, am I correct?\n\nJIMMIE\nYeah. Exactly. Under the sink.\n\nTHE WOLF\nGood. What I need you two fellas to\ndo is take those cleaning products\nand clean the inside of the car. And\nI'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You\nneed to go in the backseat, scoop up\nall those little pieces of brain and\nskull. Get it out of there.  Wipe\ndown the upholstery \u2013 now when it\ncomes to upholstery, it don't need\nto be spic and span, you don't need\nto eat off it. Give it a good once\nover. What you need to take care of\nare the really messy parts. The pools\nof blood that have collected, you\ngotta soak that shit up.  But the\nwindows are a different story.  Them\nyou really clean. Get the Windex, do\na good job. Now Jimmie, we need to\nraid your linen closet. I need\nblankets, I need comforters, I need\nquilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker\nthe better, the darker the better.\nNo whites, can't use 'em. We need to\ncamouflage the interior of the car.\nWe're gonna line the front seat and\nthe backseat and the floor boards\nwith quilts and blankets. If a cop\nstops us and starts stickin' his big\nsnout in the car, the subterfuge\nwon't last. But at a glance, the car\nwill appear to be normal.  Jimmie \u2013\nlead the way, boys \u2013 get to work.\n\nThe Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving\nVincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.\n\nVINCENT\n(calling after him)\nA \"please\" would be nice.\n\nThe Wolf stops and turns around.\n\nTHE WOLF\nCome again?\n\nVINCENT\nI said a \"please\" would be nice.\n\nThe Wolf takes a step toward him.\n\nTHE WOLF\nSet is straight, Buster. I'm not\nhere to say \"please.\"I'm here to\ntell you want to do. And if self-\npreservation is an instinct you\npossess, you better fuckin' do it\nand do it quick. I'm here to help.\nIf my help's not appreciated, lotsa\nluck gentlemen.\n\nJULES\nIt ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your\nhelp is definitely appreciated.\n\nVINCENT\nI don't mean any disrespect. I just\ndon't like people barkin' orders at\nme.\n\nTHE WOLF\nIf I'm curt with you, it's because\ntime is a factor. I think fast, I\ntalk fast, and I need you guys to\nact fast if you want to get out of\nthis. So pretty please, with sugar\non top, clean the fuckin' car.\n\nINT.

This is some fucked-up\nrepugnant shit!\n\nVINCENT\nDid you ever hear the philosophy\nthat once a man admits he's wrong,\nhe's immediately forgiven for all\nwrong-doings?\n\nJULES\nMan, get outta my face with that\nshit! The motherfucker who said that\nnever had to pick up itty-bitty pieces\nof skull with his fingers on account\nof your dumb ass.\n\nVINCENT\nI got a threshold, Jules.

Respect for one's\nelders shows character.\n\nRAQUEL\nI have character.\n\nWINSTON\nJust because you are a character\ndoesn't mean you have character.\n\nRAQUEL\nOh you're so funny, oh you're so\nfunny.\n\nThe Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.\n\nThe two men left alone look at each other.\n\nJULES\nWanna share a cab?\n\nVINCENT\nYou know I could go for some\nbreakfast.  Want to have breakfast\nwith me?\n\nJULES\nSure.\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP \u2013 MORNING\n\nJules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a\nbig stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto.\nJules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a\nmuffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a\nrefill for both men,\n\nVINCENT\nThanks a bunch.\n(to Jules, who's\nnursing his coffee)\nWant a sausage?\n\nJULES\nNaw, I don't eat pork.\n\nVINCENT\nAre you Jewish?\n\nJULES\nI ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig\non swine.\n\nVINCENT\nWhy not?\n\nJULES\nThey're filthy animals. I don't eat\nfilthy animals.\n\nVINCENT\nSausages taste good. Pork chops taste\ngood.\n\nJULES\nA sewer rat may taste like pumpkin\npie.  I'll never know 'cause even if\nit did, I wouldn't eat the filthy\nmotherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in\nshit. That's a filthy animal. I don't\nwanna eat nothin' that ain't got\nenough sense to disregard its own\nfeces.\n\nVINCENT\nHow about dogs? Dogs eat their own\nfeces.\n\nJULES\nI don't eat dog either.\n\nVINCENT\nYes, but do you consider a dog to be\na filthy animal?\n\nJULES\nI wouldn't go so far as to call a\ndog filthy, but they're definitely\ndirty. But a dog's got personality.\nAnd personality goes a long way.\n\nVINCENT\nSo by that rationale, if a pig had a\nbetter personality, he's cease to be\na filthy animal?\n\nJULES\nWe'd have to be talkin' 'bout one\nmotherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd\nhave to be the Cary Grant of pigs.\n\nThe two men laugh.\n\nVINCENT\nGood for you. Lighten up a little.\nYou been sittin' there all quiet.\n\nJULES\nI just been sittin' here thinkin'.\n\nVINCENT\n(mouthful of food)\nAbout what?\n\nJULES\nThe miracle we witnessed.\n\nVINCENT\nThe miracle you witnessed. I witnessed\na freak occurrence.\n\nJULES\nDo you know that a miracle is?\n\nVINCENT\nAn act of God.\n\nJULES\nWhat's an act of God?\n\nVINCENT\nI guess it's when God makes the\nimpossible possible. And I'm sorry\nJules, but I don't think what happened\nthis morning qualifies.\n\nJULES\nDon't you see, Vince, that shit don't\nmatter. You're judging this thing\nthe wrong way. It's not about what.\nIt could be God stopped the bullets,\nhe changed Coke into Pepsi, he found\nmy fuckin' car keys. You don't judge\nshit like this based on merit. Whether\nor not what we experienced was an\naccording-to-Hoyle miracle is\ninsignificant. What is significant\nis I felt God's touch, God got\ninvolved.\n\nVINCENT\nBut why?\n\nJULES\nThat's what's fuckin' wit' me! I\ndon't know why. But I can't go back\nto sleep.\n\nVINCENT\nSo you're serious, you're really\ngonna quit?\n\nJULES\nThe life, most definitely.\n\nVincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In\nthe b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.\n\nPATRON\nGarcon! Coffee!\n\nWe recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene\nof Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.\n\nVINCENT\nSo if you're quitting the life,\nwhat'll you do?\n\nJULES\nThat's what I've been sitting here\ncontemplating. First, I'm gonna\ndeliver this case to Marsellus. Then,\nbasically, I'm gonna walk the earth.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat do you mean, walk the earth?\n\nJULES\nYou know, like Caine in \"KUNG FU.\"\nJust walk from town to town, meet\npeople, get in adventures.\n\nVINCENT\nHow long do you intend to walk the\nearth?\n\nJULES\nUntil God puts me where he want me\nto be.\n\nVINCENT\nWhat if he never does?\n\nJULES\nIf it takes forever, I'll wait\nforever.\n\nVINCENT\nSo you decided to be a bum?\n\nJULES\nI'll just be Jules, Vincent \u2013 no\nmore, no less.\n\nVINCENT\nNo Jules, you're gonna be like those\npieces of shit out there who beg for\nchange. They walk around like a bunch\nof fuckin' zombies, they sleep in\ngarbage bins, they eat what I throw\naway, and dogs piss on 'em. They got\na word for 'em, they're called bums.\nAnd without a job, residence, or\nlegal tender, that's what you're\ngonna be \u2013 a fuckin' bum!\n\nJULES\nLook my friend, this is just where\nme and you differ \u2013\n\nVINCENT\n\u2013 what happened was peculiar \u2013 no\ndoubt about it \u2013 but it wasn't water\ninto wine.\n\nJULES\nAll shapes and sizes, Vince.\n\nVINCENT\nStop fuckin' talkin' like that!\n\nJULES\nIf you find my answers frightening,\nVincent, you should cease askin'\nscary questions.\n\nVINCENT\nI gotta take a shit. To be continued.\n\nVincent exits for the restroom.\n\nJules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin\nand Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.\n\nPUMPKIN\nEverybody be cool, this is a robbery!\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nAny of you fuckin' pricks move and\nI'll execute every one of you\nmotherfuckers!  Got that?!\n\nJules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the\ntable, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it\nout, COCKING IT.\n\nPUMPKIN\nCustomers stay seated, waitresses on\nthe floor.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nNow mean fuckin' now! Do it or die,\ndo it or fucking die!\n\nLike lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While\nHoney Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them\nterrified.\n\nPUMPKIN\nYou Mexicans in the kitchen, get out\nhere!  Asta luego!\n\nThree COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.\n\nPUMPKIN\nOn the floor or I'll cook you ass,\ncomprende?\n\nThey comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.\n\nMANAGER\nI'm the manager here, there's no\nproblem, no problem at all \u2013\n\nPumpkin heads his way.\n\nPUMPKIN\nYou're gonna give me a problem?\n\nHe reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the\nManager's neck.\n\nPUMPKIN\nWhat? You said you're gonna give me\na problem?\n\nMANAGER\nNo, I'm not. I'm not gonna give you\nany problem!\n\nPUMPKIN\nI don't know, Honey Bunny. He looks\nlike the hero type to me!\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nDon't take any chances. Execute him!\n\nThe Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his\nhand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.\n\nMANAGER\nPlease don't! I'm not a hero. I'm\njust a coffee shop manager. Take\nanything you want.\n\nPUMPKIN\nTell everyone to cooperate and it'll\nbe all over.\n\nMANAGER\nEverybody just be calm and cooperate\nwith them and this will be all over\nsoon!\n\nPUMPKIN\nWell done, now git your fuckin' ass\non the ground.\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM \u2013 MORNING\n\nVincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,\nreads his \"MODESTY BLAISE\" book.\n\nINT. COFFEE SHOP \u2013 MORNING\n\nCash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from\nthe till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter\nwith a trash bag in his hand.\n\nPUMPKIN\nOkay people, I'm going to go 'round\nand collect your wallets. Don't talk,\njust toss 'em in the bag. We clear?\n\nPumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his\n.45 ready to spit under the table.\n\nPumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,\nbriefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more\nrespectful, him manner more on guard.\n\nPUMPKIN\nIn the bag.\n\nJules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,\nPumpkin points to the briefcase.\n\nPUMPKIN\nWhat's in that?\n\nJULES\nMy boss' dirty laundry.\n\nPUMPKIN\nYou boss makes you do his laundry?\n\nJULES\nWhen he wants it clean.\n\nPUMPKIN\nSounds like a shit job.\n\nJULES\nFunny, I've been thinkin' the same\nthing.\n\nPUMPKIN\nOpen it up.\n\nJules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.\n\nJULES\n'Fraid I can't do that.\n\nPumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the\ngun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the\nhammer.\n\nPUMPKIN\nI didn't hear you.\n\nJULES\nYes, you did.\n\nThis exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard\nit, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nWhat's goin' on?\n\nPUMPKIN\nLooks like we got a vigilante in our\nmidst.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nShoot 'em in the face!\n\nJULES\nI don't mean to shatter your ego,\nbut this ain't the first time I've\nhad gun pointed at me.\n\nPUMPKIN\nYou don't open up that case, it's\ngonna be the last.\n\nMANAGER\n(on the ground)\nQuit causing problems, you'll get us\nall killed! Give 'em what you got\nand get 'em out of here.\n\nJULES\nKeep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat\nman, this ain't any of your goddamn\nbusiness!\n\nPUMPKIN\nI'm countin' to three, and if your\nhand ain't off that case, I'm gonna\nunload right in your fuckin' face.\nClear? One...\n\nPUMPKIN\n...two... three.\n\nJULES\nYou win.\n\nJules raises his hand off the briefcase.\n\nJULES\nIt's all yours, Ringo.\n\nPUMPKIN\nOpen it.\n\nJules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to\nPumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case.\nPumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across\nthe room, can't see shit.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nWhat is it? What is it?\n\nPUMPKIN\n(softly)\nIs that what I think it is?\n\nJules nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nPUMPKIN\nIt's beautiful.\n\nJules nods his head: \"yes.\"\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nGoddammit, what is it?\n\nJules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering\nthe case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to\npick up the case.\n\nLike a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of\nPumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand\ncomes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45\nhand under Pumpkin's chin.\n\nHoney Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nLet him go! Let him go! I'll blow\nyour fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya!\nI'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're\ngonna fuckin' die bad!\n\nJULES\n(to Pumpkin)\nTell that bitch to be cool! Say,\nbitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool!\n\nPUMPKIN\nChill out, honey!\n\nHONEY BUNNY\nLet him go!\n\nJULES\n(softly)\nTell her it's gonna be okay.\n\nPUMPKIN\nI'm gonna be okay.\n\nJULES\nPromise her.\n\nPUMPKIN\nI promise.\n\nJULES\nTell her to chill.\n\nPUMPKIN\nJust chill out.\n\nJULES\nWhat's her name?\n\nPUMPKIN\nYolanda.\n\nWhenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only\nat Pumpkin.\n\nJULES\n(to Yolanda)\nSo, we cool Yolanda? We ain't gonna\ndo anything stupid, are we?\n\nYOLANDA\n(crying)\nDon't you hurt him.\n\nJULES\nNobody's gonna hurt anybody. We're\ngonna be like three Fonzies. And\nwhat' Fonzie like?\n\nNo answer.\n\nJULES\nC'mon Yolanda, what's Fonzie like?\n\nYOLANDA\n(through tears, unsure)\nHe's cool?\n\nJULES\nCorrect-amundo! And that's what we're\ngonna be, we're gonna be cool.\n(to Pumpkin)\nNow Ringo, I'm gonna count to three\nand I want you to let go your gun\nand lay your palms flat on the table.\nBut when you do it, do it cool. Ready?\n\nPumpkin looks at him.\n\nJULES\nOne... two... three.\n\nPumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.\n\nYolanda can't stand it anymore.\n\nYOLANDA\nOkay, now let him go!\n\nJULES\nYolanda, I thought you were gonna be\ncool.  When you yell at me, it makes\nme nervous.  When I get nervous, I\nget scared. And when motherfuckers\nget scared, that's when motherfuckers\nget accidentally shot.\n\nYOLANDA\n(more conversational)\nJust know: you hurt him, you die.\n\nJULES\nThat seems to be the situation. Now\nI don't want that and you don't want\nthat and Ringo here don't want that.\nSo let's see what we can do.\n(to Ringo)\nNow this is the situation. Normally\nboth of your asses would be dead as\nfuckin' fried chicken. But you\nhappened to pull this shit while I'm\nin a transitional period. I don't\nwanna kill ya, I want to help ya.\nBut I'm afraid I can't give you the\ncase. It don't belong to me. Besides,\nI went through too much shit this\nmorning on account of this case to\njust hand it over to your ass.\n\nVINCENT (O.S.)\nWhat the fuck's goin' on here?\n\nYolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.\n\nVincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at\nYolanda.\n\nJULES\nIt's cool, Vincent! It's cool! Don't\ndo a goddamn thing. Yolanda, it's\ncool baby, nothin's changed. We're\nstill just talkin'.\n(to Pumpkin)\nTell her we're still cool.\n\nPUMPKIN\nIt's cool, Honey Bunny, we're still\ncool.\n\nVINCENT\n(gun raised)\nWhat the hell's goin' on, Jules?\n\nJULES\nNothin' I can't handle. I want you\nto just hang back and don't do shit\nunless it's absolutely necessary.\n\nVINCENT\nCheck.\n\nJULES\nYolanda, how we doin, baby?\n\nYOLANDA\nI gotta go pee! I want to go home.\n\nJULES\nJust hang in there, baby, you're\ndoing' great, Ringo's proud of you\nand so am I.  It's almost over.\n(to Pumpkin)\nNow I want you to go in that bag and\nfind my wallet.\n\nPUMPKIN\nWhich one is it?\n\nJULES\nIt's the one that says Bad\nMotherfucker on it.\n\nPumpkin looks in the bag and \u2013 sure enough \u2013 there's a wallet\nwith \"Bad Motherfucker\" embroidered on it.\n\nJULES\nThat's my bad motherfucker. Now open\nit up and take out the cash. How\nmuch is there?\n\nPUMPKIN\nAbout fifteen hundred dollars.\n\nJULES\nPut it in your pocket, it's yours.\nNow with the rest of them wallets\nand the register, that makes this a\npretty successful little score.\n\nVINCENT\nJules, if you give this nimrod fifteen\nhundred buck, I'm gonna shoot 'em on\ngeneral principle.\n\nJULES\nYou ain't gonna do a goddamn thing,\nnow hang back and shut the fuck up.\nBesides, I ain't givin' it to him.\nI'm buyin' somethin' for my money.\nWanna know what I'm buyin' Ringo?\n\nPUMPKIN\nWhat?\n\nJULES\nYour life. I'm givin' you that money\nso I don't hafta kill your ass. You\nread the Bible?\n\nPUMPKIN\nNot regularly.\n\nJULES\nThere's a passage I got memorized.\nEzekiel 25:17. \"The path of the\nrighteous man is beset on all sides\nby the inequities of the selfish and\nthe tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is\nhe who, in the name of charity and\ngood will, shepherds the weak through\nthe valley of the darkness. For he\nis truly his brother's keeper and\nthe finder of lost children. And I\nwill strike down upon thee with great\nvengeance and furious anger those\nwho attempt to poison and destroy my\nbrothers. And you will know I am the\nLord when I lay my vengeance upon\nyou.\" I been sayin' that shit for\nyears.  And if you ever heard it, it\nmeant your ass. I never really\nquestioned what it meant. I thought\nit was just a coldblooded thing to\nsay to a motherfucker 'fore you popped\na cap in his ass. But I saw some\nshit this mornin' made me think twice.\nNow I'm thinkin', it could mean you're\nthe evil man. And I'm the righteous\nman.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the\nshepherd protecting my righteous ass\nin the valley of darkness. Or is\ncould by you're the righteous man\nand I'm the shepherd and it's the\nworld that's evil and selfish.  I'd\nlike that. But that shit ain't the\ntruth. The truth is you're the weak.\nAnd I'm the tyranny of evil men. But\nI'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to\nbe a shepherd.\n\nJules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.\n\nPumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to\nYolanda.\n\nShe looks back.\n\nGrabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the\ndoor.\n\nJules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time,\ntakes a sip of coffee.\n\nJULES\n(to himself)\nIt's cold.\n\nHe pushes it aside.\n\nVincent appears next to Jules.\n\nVINCENT\nI think we oughta leave now.\n\nJULES\nThat's probably a good idea.\n\nVincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the\nbriefcase.\n\nThen, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the\nCooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes\n\u2013 wearing UC Santa Cruz and \"I'm with Stupid\" tee-shirts,\nswim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics \u2013 walk out of\nthe coffee shop together without saying a word.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nTHE END4Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 9, "api_path": "/songs/128874",

Pancake", "lyrics": "Trilobites LyricsI open the truck's door, step onto the brick side street. I look at Company Hill again, all sort of worn down and round. A long time ago it was real craggy, and stood like an island in the Teays River. It took over a million years to make that smooth little hill, and I've looked all over it for trilobites. I think how it has always been there and always will be, least for as long as it matters. The air is smoky with summertime. A bunch of starlings swim over me. I was born in this country and I have never very much wanted to leave. I remember Pop's dead eyes looking at me. They were real dry, and that took something out of me. I shut the door, head for the caf\u00e9.\n\nI see a concrete patch in the street. It's shaped like Florida, and I recollect what I wrote in Ginny's yearbook: \"We will live on mangoes and love.\" And she up and left without me\u2014two years she's been down there without me. She sends me postcards with alligator wrestlers and flamingos on the front. She never asks me any questions. I feel like a real fool for what I wrote, and go into the caf\u00e9.\n\nThe place is empty, and I rest in the cooled air. Tinker Reilly's little sister pours my coffee. She has good hips. They are kind of like Ginny's and they slope nice curves to her legs. Hips and legs like that climb steps into airplanes. She goes to the counter end and scoffs down the rest of her sundae. I smile at her, but she's jailbait. Jailbait and black snakes are two things I won't touch with a window pole. One time I used an old black snake for a bullwhip, snapped the sucker's head off, and Pop beat hell out of me with it. I think how Pop could make me pretty mad sometimes. I grin.\n\nI think about last night when Ginny called. Her old man drove her down from the airport in Charleston. She was already bored. Can we get together? Sure. Maybe do some brew? Sure. Same old Colly. Same old Ginny. She talked through her beak. I wanted to tell her Pop had died, and Mom was on the warpath to sell the farm, but Ginny was talking through her beak. It gave me the creeps.\n\nJust like the cups give me the creeps. I look at the cups hanging on pegs by the storefront. They're decal-named and covered with grease and dust. There's four of them, and one is Pop's, but that isn't what gives me the creeps. The cleanest one is Jim's. It's clean because he still uses it, but it hangs there with the rest. Through the window, I can see him crossing the street. His joints are cemented with arthritis. I think of how long it'll be before I croak, but Jim is old, and it gives me the creeps to see his cup hanging up there. I go to the door to help him in.\n\nHe says, \"Tell the truth, now,\" and his old paw pinches my arm.\nI say, \"Can't do her.\" I help him to his stool.\n\nI pull this globby rock from my pocket, and slap it on the counter in front of Jim. He turns it with his drawn hand, examines it. \"Gastropod,\" he says. \"Probably Permian. You buy again.\" I can't win with him. He knows them all.\n\n\"I still can't find a trilobite,\" I say.\n\n\"There are a few,\" he says. \"Not many. Most of the outcrops around here are too late for them.\"\n\nThe girl brings Jim's coffee in his cup, and we watch her pump back to the kitchen. Good hips.\n\n\"You see that?\" He jerks his head toward her.\n\nI say, \"Moundsville Molasses.\" I can spot jailbait by a mile.\n\n\"Hell, girl's age never stopped your dad and me in Michigan.\"\n\n\"Tell the truth.\"\n\n\"Sure. You got to time it so you nail the first freight out when your pants are up.\"\n\nI look at the windowsill. It is speckled with the crisp skeletons of flies. \"Why'd you and Pop leave Michigan?\"\n\nThe crinkles around Jim's eyes go slack. He says, \"The war,\" and sips his coffee.\n\nI say, \"He never made it back there.\"\n\"Me either\u2014always wanted to\u2014there or Germany\u2014just to look around.\"\n\n\"Yeah, he promised to show me where you all buried that silverware and stuff during the war.\"\n\nHe says, \"On the Elbe. Probably plowed up by now.\"\n\nMy eye socket reflects in my coffee, steam curls around my face, and I feel a headache coming on. I look up to ask Tinker's sister for an aspirin, but she is giggling in the kitchen.\n\n\"That's where he got that wound,\" Jim says. \"Got it on the Elbe. He was out a long time. Cold, Jesus, it was cold. I had him for dead, but he came to. Says, 'I been all over the world'; says, 'China's so pretty, Jim.'\"\n\n\"Dreaming?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I quit worrying about that stuff years ago.\"\n\nTinker's sister comes up with her coffeepot to make us for a tip. I ask her for an aspirin, and see she's got a pimple on her collarbone. I don't remember seeing pictures of China. I watch little sister's hips.\n\n\"Trent still wanting your place for that housing project?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" I say. \"Mom'll probably sell it, too. I can't run the place like Pop did. Cane looks bad as hell.\" I drain off my cup. I'm tired of talking about the farm. \"Going out with Ginny tonight,\" I say.\n\n\"Give her that for me,\" he says. He takes a poke at my whang. I don't like it when he talks about her like that. He sees I don't like it, and his grin slips. \"Found a lot of gas for her old man. One hell of a guy before his wife pulled out.\"\n\nI wheel on my stool, clap his weak old shoulder. l thnk of Pop, and try to joke. \"You stink so bad the undertaker's following you.\"\n\nHe laughs. \"You were the ugliest baby ever born, you know that?\"\nI grin, and start out the door. I can hear him shout to little sister: \"Come on over here, honey, I got a joke for you.\"\n\nThe sky has a film. Its heat burns through the salt on my skin, draws it tight. I start the truck, drive west along the highway built on the dry bed of the Teays. There's wide bottoms, and the hills on either side have yellowy billows the sun can't burn off. I pass an iron sign put up by the WPA: \"Surveyed by George Washington, the Teays River Pike.\" I see fields and cattle where buildings stand, picture them from some long-off time.\n\nI turn off the main road to our house. Clouds make the sunshine blink light and dark in the yard. I look again at the spot of ground where Pop fell. He had lain spread-eagled in the thick grass after a sliver of metal from his old wound passed to his brain. I remember thinking how beaten his face looked with prints in it from the grass.\n\nI reach the high barn, and start my tractor, then drive to the knob at the end of our land and stop. I sit there, smoke, look again at the cane. The rows curve tight, but around them is a sort of scar of clay, and the leaves have a purplish blight. I don't wonder about the blight. I know the cane is too far gone to worry about the blight. Far off, somebody chops wood, and the ax-bites echo back to me. The hillsides are baked here and have heat-ghosts. Our cattle move to the wind gap, and birds hide in caps of trees where we never cut the timber for pasture. I look at the wrinkly old boundary post. Pop set it when the hobo and soldier days were over. It is a locust-tree post, and will be there a long time. A few dead morning glories cling to it.\n\n\"I'm just not no good at it,\" I say. \"It just don't do to work your ass off at something you're not no good at.\"\n\nThe chopping stops. I listen to the beat of grasshopper wings, and strain to spot blight on the far side of the bottoms.\n\nI say, \"Yessir, Colly, you couldn't grow pole beans in a pile of horseshit.\"\n\nI squash my cigarette against the floor plate. I don't want a fire. I press the starter, and bump around the fields, then down to the ford of the drying creek, and up the other side. Turkles fall from logs into stagnant pools. I stop my machine. The cane here is just as bad. I rub a sunburn into the back of my neck.\n\nI say, \"Shot to hell, Gin. Can't do nothing right.\"\n\nI lean back, try to forget these fields and flanking hills. A long time before me or these tools, the Teays flowed here. I can almost feel the cold waters and the tickling the trilobites make when they crawl. All the water from the old mountains flowed west. But the land lifted. I have only the bottoms and stone animals I collect. I blink and breathe. My father is a khaki cloud in the canebrakes, and Ginny is no more to me than the bitter smell in the blackberry briers up on the ridge.\n\nI take up my sack and gaff for a turkle. Some quick chubs flash under the bank. In the moss-dapples, I see rings spread where a turkle ducked under. This sucker is mine. The pool smells like rot, and the sun is a hardish brown.\n\nI wade in. He goes for the roots of a log. I shove around, and feel my gaff twitch. This is a smart turkle, but still a sucker. I bet he could pull liver off a hook for the rest of his days, but he is a sucker for the roots that hold him while I work my gaff. I pull him up, and see he is a snapper. He's got his stubby neck curved round, biting at the gaff. I lay him on the sand, and take out Pop's knife. I step on the shell, and press hard. That fat neck gets skinny quick, and sticks way out. A little blood oozes from the gaff wound into the grit, but when I slice, a puddle forms.\n\nA voice says, \"Get a dragon, Colly?\"\n\nI shiver a little, and look up. It's only the loansman standing on the creekbank in his tan suit. His face is splotched pink, and the sun is turning his glasses black.\n\n\"I crave them now and again,\" I say. I go on slitting gristle, skinning back the shell.\n\n\"Aw, your daddy loved turtle meat,\" the guy says.\n\nI listen to scratching cane leaves in the late sun. I dump the tripes into the pool, bag the rest, and head up the ford. I say, \"What can I do for you?\"\n\nThis guy starts up: \"I saw you from the road\u2014just came down to see about my offer.\" \"I told you yesterday, Mr. Trent. It ain't mine to sell.\" I tone it down. I don't want hard feelings. \"You got to talk to Mom.\"\n\nBlood drips from the poke to the dust. It makes dark paste. Trent pockets his hands, looks over the cane. A cloud blocks the sun, and my crop glows greenish in the shade.\n\n\"This is about the last real farm left around here,\" Trent says.\n\n\"Blight'll get what the dry left,\" I say. I shift the sack to my free hand. I see I'm giving in. I'm letting this guy go and push me around.\n\n\"How's your mother getting along?\" he says. I see no eyes behind his smoky glasses.\n\n\"Pretty good,\" I say. \"She's wanting to move to Akron.\" I swing the sack a little toward Ohio, and spray some blood on Trent's pants. \"Sorry,\" I say.\n\n\"It'll come out,\" he says, but I hope not. I grin and watch the turkle's mouth gape on the sand. \"Well, why Akron?\" he says. \"Family there?\"\n\nI nod. \"Hers,\" I say \"She'll take you up on the offer.\" This hot shadow saps me, and my voice is a whisper. I throw the sack to the floor plate, climb up to grind the starter. I feel better in a way I've never known. The hot metal seat burns through my jeans.\n\n\"Saw Ginny at the post office,\" this guy shouts. \"She sure is a pretty.\"\n\nI wave, almost smile, as I gear to lumber up the dirt road. I pass Trent's dusty Lincoln, move away from my bitten cane. It can go now; the stale seed, the\tdrought, the blight\u2014it can go when she signs the papers. I know I will always be to blame, but it can't just be my fault. \"What about you?\" I say. \"Your side hurt all that morning, but you wouldn't see no doctor. Nosir, you had to see that your dumb boy got the crop put proper in the ground.\" I shut my trap to keep from talking like a fool.\n\nI stop my tractor on the terraced road to the barn, and look back across the cane to the creekbed. Yesterday, Trent said the bottoms would be filled with dirt. That will put the houses above flood, but it'll raise the flood line. Under all those houses, my turkles will turn to stone. Our Herefords make rusty patches on the hill. I see Pop's grave, and wonder if the new high waters will get over it.\n\nI watch the cattle play. A rain must be coming. A rain is always coming when cattle play. Sometimes they play for snow, but mostly it is rain. After Pop whipped the daylights out of me with that black snake, he hung it on a fence. But it didn't rain. The cattle weren't playing, and it didn't rain, but I kept my mouth shut. The snake was bad enough, I didn't want the belt too.\n\nI look a long time at that hill. My first time with Ginny was in the tree-cap of that hill. I think of how close we could be then, and maybe even now, I don't know. I'd like to go with Ginny, fluff her hair in any other field. But I can see her in the post office. I bet she was sending postcards to some guy in Florida.\n\nI drive on to the barn, stop under the shed. I wipe sweat from my face with my sleeve, and see how the seams have slipped from my shoulders. If I sit rigid, I can fill them again. The turkle is moving in the sack, and it gives me the creeps to hear his shell clinking against the gaff. I take the poke to the spigot to clean the game. Pop always liked turkle in a mulligan. He talked a lot about mulligan and the jungles just an hour before I found him.\n\nI wonder what it will be like when Ginny comes by. I hope she's not talking through her beak. Maybe she'll take me to her house this time. If her momma had been anybody but Pop's cousin, her old man would let me go to her house. Screw him. But I can talk to Ginny. I wonder if she remembers the plans we made for the farm. And we wanted kids. She always nagged about a peacock. I will get her one.\n\nI smile as I dump the sack into the rusty sink, but the barn smell\u2014the hay, the cattle, the gasoline\u2014it reminds me. Me and Pop built this barn. I look at every nail with the same dull pain.\n\nI clean the meat, and lay it out on a piece of cloth torn from an old bed sheet. I fold the corners, walk to the house.\n\nThe air is hot, but it sort of churns, and the set screens in the kitchen window rattle. From inside, I can hear Mom and Trent talking on the front porch, and I leave the window up. It is the same come-on he gave me yesterday, and I bet Mom is eating it up. She probably thinks about tea parties with her cousins in Akron. She never listens to what anybody says. She just says all right to anything anybody but me or Pop ever said. She even voted for Hoover before they got married. I throw the turkle meat into a skillet, get a beer. Trent softens her up with me; I prick my ears.\n\n\"I would wager on Colly's agreement,\" he says. I can still hear a hill twang in his voice.\n\n\"I told him Sam'd put him on at Goodrich,\" she says. \"They'd teach him a trade.\"\n\n\"And there are a good many young people in Akron. You know he'd be happier.\" I think how his voice sounds like a damn TV. \"Well, he's awful good to keep me company. Don't go out none since Ginny took off to that college.\"\n\nI lean against the sink, rub my hands across my face. The smell of turkie has soaked between my fingers. It's the same smell as the pools.\n\nThrough the door to the living room, I see the rock case Pop built for me. The white labels show up behind the dark gloss of glass. Ginny helped me find over half of those. If I did study in a college, I could come back and take Jim's place at the gas wells. I like to hold little stones that lived so long ago. But geology doesn't mean lick to me. I can't even find a trilobite.\n\nI stir the meat, listen for noise or talk on the porch, but there is none. I look out. A lightning flash peels shadows from the yard, and leaves a dark strip under the eave of the barn. I feel a scum on my skin in the still air. I take my supper to the porch.\n\nI look down the valley to where bison used to graze before the first rails were put down. Now those rails are covered with a highway, and cars rush back and forth in the wind. I watch Trent's car back out, heading east into town. I'm afraid to ask right off if he got what he wanted.\n\nI stick my plate under Mom's nose, but she waves it off. I sit in Pop's old rocker, watch the storm come. Dust devils puff around on the berm, and maple sprigs land in the yard with their white bellies up. Across the road, our windbreak bends, rows of cedars furling every which way at once.\n\n\"Coming a big one?\" I say.\n\nMom says nothing and fans herself with the funeral home fan. The wind layers her hair, but she keeps that cardboard picture of Jesus bobbing like crazy. Her face changes. I know what she thinks. She thinks how she isn't the girl in the picture on the mantel. She isn't standing with Pop's garrison cap cocked on her head.\n\n\"I wish you'd of come out while he's here,\" she says. She stares across the road to the windbreak.\n\n\"I heard him yesterday,\" I say.\n\n\"It ain't that at all,\" she says, and I watch her brow come down a little. \"It's like when Jim called us askin' if we wanted some beans an' I had to tell him to leave 'em in the truck at church. I swan how folks talk when men come 'round a widow.\"\n\nI know Jim talks like a dumb old fart, but it isn't like he'd rape her or anything. I don't want to argue with her. \"Well,\" I say, \"who owns this place?\"\n\n\"We still do. Don't have to sign nothin' till tomorrow.\"\n\nShe quits bobbing Jesus to look at me. She starts up: \"You'll like Akron. Law, I bet Marcy's youngest girl'd love to meet you. She's a regular rock hound too. 'Sides, your father always said we'd move there when you got big enough to run the farm.\"\n\nI know she has to say it. I just keep my mouth shut. The rain comes, ringing the roof tin. I watch the high wind snap branches from the trees. Pale splinters of light shoot down behind the far hills. We are just brushed by this storm.\n\ninny's sports car hisses east on the road, honking as it passes, but I know she will be back.\n\n\"Just like her momma,\" Mom says, \"racin' the devil for the beer joints.\"\n\n\"She never knew her momma,\" I say. I set my plate on the floor. I'm glad Ginny thought to honk.\n\n\"What if I's to run off with some foreman from the wells?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't do that, Mom.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" she says, and watches the cars roll by. \"Shot her in Chicago. Shot hisself too.\"\n\nI look beyond the hills and time. There is red hair clouding the pillow, blood-splattered by the slug. Another body lies rumpled and warm at the bed foot.\n\n\"Folks said he done it cause she wouldn't marry him. Found two weddin' bands in his pocket. Feisty little I-taliun.\"\n\nI see police and reporters in the tiny room. Mumbles spill into the hallway, but nobody really looks at the dead woman's face.\n\n\"Well,\" Mom says, \"at least they was still wearin' their clothes.\"\n\nThe rain slows, and for a long time I sit watching the blue chicory swaying beside the road. I think of all the people I know who left these hills. Only Jim and Pop came back to the land, worked it.\n\n\"Lookee at the willow wisps.\" Mom points to the hills.\n\nThe rain trickles, and as it seeps in to cool the ground, a fog rises. The fog curls little ghosts into the branches and gullies. The sun tries to sift through this mist, but is only a tarnished brown splotch in the pinkish sky. Wherever the fog is, the light is a burnished orange.\n\n\"Can't recall the name Pop gave it,\" I say.\n\nThe colors shift, trade tones.\n\n'He had some funny names all right. Called a tomcat a 'pussy scat.'\"\n\nI think back. \"Cornflakes were 'pone-rakes,' and a chicken was a 'sick-un.'\"\n\nWe laugh.\n\n'Well,\" she says, \"he'll always be a part of us.\"\n\nThe glommy paint on the chair arm packs under my fingernails. I think how she could foul up a free lunch.\n\nI stand up to go in, but I hold the screen, look for something to say.\n\n'I ain't going to live in Akron,\" I say.\n\n'An' just where you gonna live, Mister?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nShe starts up with her fan again.\n\n'Me and Ginny's going low-riding,\" I say.\n\nShe won't look at me. \"Get in early. Mr. Trent don't keep no late hours for no beer drinkers.\"\n\nThe house is quiet, and I can hear her out there sniffling. But what to hell can I do about it? I hurry to wash the smell of turkle from my hands. I shake all over while the water flows down. I talked back. I've never talked back. I'm scared, but I stop shaking. Ginny can't see me shaking. I just walk out to the road without ever looking back to the porch.\n\nI climb in the car, let Ginny kiss my cheek. She looks different. I've never seen these clothes, and she wears too much jewelry.\n\n\"You look great,\" she says. \"Haven't changed a bit\"\n\n'We drive west along the Pike.\n\n\"Where we going?\"\n\nShe says, \"Let's park for old times' sake. How's the depot?\"\n\nI say, \"Sure.\" I reach back for a can of Falls City. \"You let your hair grow.\"\n\n\"You like?\"\n\n\"Um, yeah.\"\n\nWe drive. I look at the tinged fog, the colors changing hue.\n\nShe says, \"Sort of an eerie evening, huh?\" It all comes from her beak.\n\n\"Pop always called it a fool's fire or something.\"\n\nWe pull in beside the old depot. It's mostly boarded up. We drink, watch the colors slip to gray dusk in the sky.\n\n\"You ever look in your yearbook?\" I gulp down the rest of my City.\n\nShe goes crazy laughing. \"You know,\" she says, \"I don't even know where I put that thing.\"\n\nI feel way too mean to say anything. I look across the railroad to a field sown in timothy. There are wells there, pumps to suck the ancient gases. The gas burns blue, and I wonder if the ancient sun was blue. The tracks run on till they're a dot in the brown haze. They give off clicks from their switches. Some tankers wait on the spur. Their wheels are rusting to the tracks. I wonder what to hell I ever wanted with trilobites.\n\n\"Big night in Rock Camp,\" I say. I watch Ginny drink. Her skin is so white it glows yellowish, and the last light makes sparks in her red hair.\n\nShe says, \"Daddy would raise hell. Me this close to the wells.\"\n\n\"You're a big girl now. C'mon, let's walk.\"\n\nWe get out, and she up and grabs my arm. Her fingers feel like ribbons on the veins of my hand.\n\n\"How long you in for?\" I say.\n\n\"Just a week here, then a week with Daddy in New York. I can't wait to get back. It's great.\"\n\n\"You got a guy?\"\n\nShe looks at me with this funny smile of hers. \"Yeah, I got a guy. He's doing plankton research.\"\n\nEver since I talked back, I've been afraid, but now I hurt again. We come to the tankers, and she takes hold on a ladder, steps up.\n\n\"This right?\" She looks funny, all crouched in like she's just nailed a drag on the fly. I laugh.\n\n\"Nail the end nearest the engine. If you slip, you get throwed clear. Way you are a drag on the fiy'd suck you under. 'Sides, nobody'd ride a tanker.\"\n\nShe steps down, but doesn't take my hand. \"He taught you everything. What killed him?\"\n\n\"Little shell fragment. Been in him since the war. Got in his blood . . .\" I snap my fingers. I want to talk, but the picture won't become words. I see myself scattered, every cell miles from the others. I pull them back and kneel in the dark grass. I roll the body faceup, and look in the eyes a long time before I shut them. \"You never talk about your momma,\" I say.\n\nShe says, \"1 don't want to,\" and goes running to an open window in the depot. She peeks in, turns to me. \"Can we go in?\"\n\n\"Why? Nothing in there but old freight scales.\"\n\n\"Because it's spooky and neat and I want to.\" She runs back, kisses me on the cheek. \"I'm bored with this glum look. Smile!\"\n\nI give up, and walk to the depot. I drag a rotten bench under the broken window, and climb in. I take Ginny's hand to help her. A blade of glass slices her forearm. The cut path is shallow, but I take off my T-shirt to wrap it. The blood blots purple on the cloth.\n\n\"Hurt?\"\n\n'Not really.\"\n\nI watch a mud dauber land on the glass blade. Its metal-blue wings flick as it walks the edge. It sucks what the glass has scraped from her skin. I hear them working in the walls.\n\nGinny is at the other window, and she peers through a knothole in the plywood.\n\nI say, \"See that light green spot on the second hill?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"That's the copper on your-all's roof.\"\n\nShe turns, stares at me.\n\n\"I come here lots,\" I say. I breathe the musty air. I turn away from her, and look out the window to Company Hill, but I can feel her stare. Company Hill looks bigger in the dusk, and I think of all the hills around town I've never set foot on. Ginny comes up behind me, and there's a glass-crunch with her steps. The hurt arm goes around me, the tiny spot of blood cold against my back.\n\n\"What is it, Colly? Why can't we have any fun?\"\n\n\"When I was a young punk, I tried to run away from home. I was walking through this meadow on the other side of the Hill, and this shadow passed over me. I honest to god thought it was a pterodactyl. It was a damned airplane. I was so damn mad, I came home.\" I peel chips of paint from the window frame, wait for her to talk. She leans against me, and I kiss her real deep. Her waist bunches in my hands. The skin of her neck is almost too white in the faded evening. I know she doesn't understand.\n\nI slide her to the floor. Her scent rises to me, and I shove crates aside to make room. I don't wait. She isn't making love, she's getting laid. All right, I think, all right. Get laid. I pull her pants around her ankles, rut her. I think of Tinker's sister. Ginny isn't here. Tinker's sister is under me. A wash of blue light passes over me. I open my eyes to the floor, smell that tang of rain- wet wood. Black snakes. It was the only time he had to whip me.\n\n\"Let me go with you,\" I say. I want to be sorry, but I can't.\n\n\"Colly, please. . .\" She shoves me back. Her head is rolling in splinters of paint and glass.\n\nI look a long time at the hollow shadows hiding her eyes. She is somebody I met a long time ago. I can't remember her name for a minute, then it comes back to me. I sit against the wall and my spine aches. I listen to the mud daubers building nests, and trace a finger along her throat.\n\nShe says, \"I want to go. My arm hurts.\" Her voice comes from someplace deep in her chest.\n\nWe climb out. A yellow light burns on the crossties, and the switches click. Far away, I hear a train. She gives me my shirt, and gets in her car. I stand there looking at the blood spots on the cloth. I feel old as hell. When I look up, her taillights are reddish blurs in the fog.\n\nI walk around to the platform, slump on the bench. The evening cools my eyelids. I think of how that one time was the only airplane that ever passed over me.\n\nI picture my father\u2014a young hobo with the Michigan sunset making him squint, the lake behind him. His face is hard from all the days and places he fought to live in, and of a sudden, I know his mistake was coming back here to set that locust-tree post on the knob.\n\n\"Ever notice how only blue lightning bugs come out after a rain? Green ones almost never do.\"\n\nI hear the train coming. She is highballing all right. No stiffs in that blind baggage.\n\n\"Well, you know the Teays must of been a big river. Just stand on Company Hill, and look across the bottoms. You'll see.\"\n\nMy skin is heavy with her noise. Her light cuts a wide slice in the fog. No stiff in his right mind could try this one on the fly. She's hell-bent for election.\n\n\"Jim said it flowed west by northwest\u2014all the way up to the old St. Lawrence Drain. Had garfish\u2014ten, maybe twenty foot long. Said they're still in there.\"\n\nGood old Jim'll probably croak on a lie like that. I watch her beat by. A worn-out tie belches mud with her weight. She's just too fast to jump. Plain and simple.\n\nI get up. I'll spend tonight at home. I've got eyes to shut in Michigan\u2014maybe even Germany or China, I don't know yet. I walk, but I'm not scared. I feel my fear moving away in rings through time for a million years.3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/208443", "artist_names": "Tommy James and the Shondells", "full_title": "Crystal Blue Persuasion by\u00a0Tommy\u00a0James and the Shondells", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/08cf513c3c35f4b8869ea9ef6488a4b9.300x150x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/08cf513c3c35f4b8869ea9ef6488a4b9.1000x500x1.jpg", "id": 208443, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 272731, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1570135272, "path": "/Tommy-james-and-the-shondells-crystal-blue-persuasion-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 4, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Tommy-james-and-the-shondells-crystal-blue-persuasion-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1969, "month": 7, "day": 1}, "release_date_for_display": "July 1, 1969", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jul. 1, 1969", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/ede0bde7bb98f1e4c1e4d5459d390640.300x299x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ede0bde7bb98f1e4c1e4d5459d390640.425x424x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 20074}, "title": "Crystal Blue Persuasion", "title_with_featured": "Crystal Blue Persuasion", "updated_by_human_at": 1645410797, "url": "https://genius.com/Tommy-james-and-the-shondells-crystal-blue-persuasion-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/67184", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/de48ade6480009836629af8b3fce6c98.500x253x1.jpg", "id": 67184, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d9fea044b9bbb49ff5f0a40ce89345df.513x513x1.png", "index_character": "t", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Tommy James and the Shondells", "slug": "Tommy-james-and-the-shondells", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Tommy-james-and-the-shondells"}, "artist": "Tommy James and the Shondells", "lyrics": "Crystal Blue Persuasion Lyrics[Verse 1]\nLook over yonder\nWhat do you see?\nThe sun is a-rising\nMost definitely\nA new day is coming (whoo-hoo!)\nPeople are changing\nAin't it beautiful?

starch\nWhat's the use of hiding?\nTell the socialites to look the other way\nIt's instinctive stimulation you convey\nIt's a necessary function\nMeant for those without compunction\nWho get tired of vanilla every day\n\n[Verse 3]\nSweet cream ladies, forward march\nPuritans ignore them\nSweet cream ladies do their part\nSweet cream men adore them\nLet them satisfy the ego of the male\nLet them fabricate success to those who fail\nAnd should penalties pursue them\nWhen there's really credit due them\nThey might keep a simple fellow out of jail\n\n[Outro]\nSweet cream ladies, forward

twig\n\nThen the first snow came\nAnd she ran out to brush the snow away\nSo it wouldn't die\nCame runnin' in all excited\nSlipped and almost hurt herself\nAnd I laughed till I cried\nShe was always young at heart\nKinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so\nAnd I surprised her with a puppy\nKept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago\n\nAnd it would sure embarrass her\nWhen I came in from workin' late\nCause I would know\nThat she'd been sittin' there and cryin'\nOver some sad and silly late, late show\n\nAnd honey, I miss you\nAnd I'm bein' good\nAnd I'd love to be with you\nIf only I

He misunderstruck and aim for am ollo of number three of them and left his free natural ri-postes to four of them in their own fine artful disorder.)\n\nI. What secondtonone myther rector and maximost bridges-maker was the first to rise taller through his beanstale than the bluegum buaboababbaun or the giganteous Wellingtonia Sequoia; went nudiboots with trouters into a liffeyette when she was barely in her tricklies; was well known to claud a conciliation cap onto the esker of his hooth; sports a chainganger\u2019s albert solemenly over his hullender\u2019s epulence; thought he weighed a new ton when there felled his first lapapple; gave the heinous-ness of choice to everyknight betwixt yesterdicks and twomaries; had sevenal successivecoloured serebanmaids on the same big white drawringroam horthrug; is a Willbeforce to this hour at house as he was in heather; pumped the catholick wartrey and shocked the prodestung boyne; killed his own hungery self in anger as a young man; found fodder for five when allmarken rose goflooded; with Hirish tutores Cornish made easy; voucher of rotables, toll of the road; bred manyheaded stepsons for one leapyourown taughter; is too funny for a fish and has too much outside for an insect; like a heptagon crystal emprisoms trues and fauss for us; is infinite swell in unfitting induments; once was he shovelled and once was he arsoned and once was he inundered and she hung him out billbailey; has a quadrant in his tile to tell Toler cad a\u2019clog it is; offers chances to Long on but stands up to Legge before; found coal at the end of his harrow and moss-roses behind the seams; made a fort out of his postern and wrote F.E.R.T. on his buckler; is escapemaster-inchief from all sorts of houdingplaces; if he outharrods against barkers, to the shool-bred he acts whiteley; was evacuated at the mere appearance of three germhuns and twice besieged by a sweep; from zoomor-phology to omnianimalism he is brooched by the spin of a coin; towers, an eddistoon amid the lampless, casting swannbeams on the deep; threatens thunder upon malefactors and sends whispers up fraufrau\u2019s froufrous; when Dook Hookbackcrook upsits his ass booseworthies jeer and junket but they boos him oos and baas his aas when he lukes like Hunkett Plunkett; by sosannsos and search a party on a lady of this city; business, reading news-paper, smoking cigar, arranging tumblers on table, eating meals, pleasure, etcetera, etcetera, pleasure, eating meals, arranging tum-blers on table, smoking cigar, reading newspaper, business; minerals, wash and brush up, local views, juju toffee, comic and birthdays cards; those were the days and he was their hero; pink sunset shower, red clay cloud, sorrow of Sahara, oxhide on Iren; arraigned and attainted, listed and lited, pleaded and proved; catches his check at banck of Indgangd and endurses his doom at chapel exit; brain of the franks, hand of the christian, tongue of the north; commands to dinner and calls the bluff; has a block at Morgen\u2019s and a hatache all the afternunch; plays gehamerat when he\u2019s ernst but misses mausey when he\u2019s lustyg; walked as far as the Head where he sat in state as the Rump; shows Early Eng-lish tracemarks and a marigold window with manigilt lights, a myrioscope, two remarkable piscines and three wellworthseeing ambries; arches all portcullised and his nave dates from dots; is a horologe unstoppable and the Benn of all bells; fuit, isst and herit and though he\u2019s mildewstaned he\u2019s mouldystoned; is a quer-cuss in the forest but plane member for Megalopolis; mountun \u2014 mighty, faunonfleetfoot; plank in our platform, blank in our scouturn; hidal, in carucates he is enumerated, hold as an earl, he counts; shipshaped phrase of buglooking words with a form like the easing moments of a graminivorous; to our dooms brought he law, our manoirs he made his vill of; was an over-grind to the underground and acqueduced for fierythroats; sends boys in socks acoughawhooping when he lets farth his carbon-oxside and silk stockings show her shapings when he looses hose on hers; stocks dry puder for the Ill people and pinkun\u2019s pellets for all the Pale; gave his mundyfoot to Miserius, her pinch to Anna Livia, that superfine pigtail to Cerisia Cerosia and quid rides to Titius, Caius and Sempronius; made the man who had no notion of shopkeepers feel he\u2019d rather play the duke than play the gentleman; shot two queans and shook three caskles when he won his game of dwarfs; fumes inwards like a strombolist till he smokes at both ends; manmote, befier of him, womankind, pietad!; shows one white drift of snow among the gorsegrowth of his crown and a chaperon of repentance on that which shed gore; pause and quies, triple bill; went by metro for the polis and then hoved by; to the finders, hail! woa, you that seek!; whom fillth had plenished, dearth devoured; hock is leading, cocoa comes next, emery tries for the flag; can dance the O\u2019Bruin\u2019s polerpasse at Noolahn to his own orchistruss accompaniment; took place before the internatural convention of catholic midwives and found stead before the congress for the study of endonational calamities; makes a delictuous entr\u201ae and finishes off the course between sweets and savouries; flouts for forecasts, flairs for finds and the fun of the fray on the fairground; cleared out three hun-dred sixty five idles to set up one all khalassal for henwives hoping to have males; the flawhoolagh, the grasping one, the kindler of paschal fire; forbids us our trespassers as we forgate him; the phoenix be his pyre, the cineres his sire!; piles big pelium on little ossas like the pilluls of hirculeads; has an eatupus complex and a drinkthedregs kink; wurstmeats for chumps and cowcar-lows for scullions; when he plies for our favour is very trolly ours; two psychic espousals and three desertions; may be matter of fact now but was futter of magd then; Cattermole Hill, ex-mountain of flesh was reared up by stress and sank under strain; tank it up, dank it up, tells the tailor to his tout; entoutcas for a man, but bit a thimble for a maid; blimp, blump; a dud letter, a sing a song a sylble; a byword, a sentence with surcease; while stands his canyouseehim frails shall fall; was hatched at Cellbridge but ejoculated abrood; as it gan in the biguinnengs so wound up in a battle of Boss; Roderick, Roderick, Roderick, O, you\u2019ve gone the way of the Danes; variously catalogued, regularly regrouped; a bushboys holoday, a quacker\u2019s mating, a wenches\u2019 sandbath; the same homoheatherous checkinlossegg as when sollyeye airly blew ye; real detonation but false report; spa mad but inn sane; half emillian via bogus census but a no street hausmann when allphannd; is the handiest of all andies and a most alleghant spot to dump your hump; hands his secession to the new patricius but plumps plebmatically for the bloody old centuries; eats with doors open and ruts with gates closed; some dub him Rotshield and more limn him Rockyfellow; shows he\u2019s fly to both demis-fairs but thries to cover up his tracers; seven dovecotes cooclaim to have been pigeonheim to this homer, Smerrnion, Rhoebok, Kolonsreagh, Seapoint, Quayhowth, Ashtown, Ratheny; inde-pendent of the lordship of chamberlain, acknowledging the rule of Rome; we saw thy farm at Useful Prine, Domhnall, Domhnall; reeks like Illbelpaese and looks like Iceland\u2019s ear; lodged at quot places, lived through tot reigns; takes a szumbath for his weekend and a wassarnap for his refreskment; after a good bout at stool-ball enjoys Giroflee Giroflaa; what Nevermore missed and Colombo found; believes in everyman his own goaldkeeper and in Africa for the fullblacks; the arc of his drive was forty full and his stumps were pulled at eighty; boasts him to the thick-inthews the oldest creater in Aryania and looks down on the Suiss family Collesons whom he calls les nouvelles roches; though his heart, soul and spirit turn to pharaoph times, his love, faith and hope stick to futuerism; light leglifters cense him souriantes from afore while boor browbenders curse him grommelants to his hindmost; between youlasses and yeladst glimse of Even; the Lug his peak has, the Luk his pile; drinks tharr and wodhar for his asama and eats the unparishable sow to styve off reglar rack; the beggars cloak them reclined about his paddystool, the whores winken him as they walk their side; on Christienmas at Advent Lodge, New Yealand, after a lenty illness the roeverand Mr Easterling of pentecostitis, no followers by bequest, fanfare all private; Gone Where Glory Waits Him (Ball, bulletist) but Not Here Yet (Maxwell, clark); comminxed under articles but phoe-nished a borgiess; from the vat on the bier through the burre in the dark to the buttle of the bawn; is AI an the highest but Roh re his root; filled fanned of hackleberries whenas all was tuck and toss up for him as a yangster to fall fou of hockinbechers wherein he had gauged the use of raisin; ads aliments, das doles, raps rustics, tams turmoil; sas seed enough for a semination but sues skivvies on the sly; learned to speak from hand to mouth till he could talk earish with his eyes shut; hacked his way through hickheckhocks but hanged hishelp from there hereafters; rialtos, annesleyg, binn and balls to say nothing atolk of New Comyn; the gleam of the glow of the shine of the sun through the dearth of the dirth on the blush of the brick of the viled ville of Barnehulme has dust turned to brown; these dyed to tartan him, rueroot, dulse, bracken, teasel, fuller\u2019s ash, sundew and cress; long gunn but not for cotton; stood his sharp assault of famine but grew girther, girther and girther; he has twenty four or so cousins germinating in the United States of America and a namesake with an initial difference in the once kingdom of Poland; his first\u2019s a young rose and his second\u2019s French\u2013Egyptian and his whole means a slump at Christie\u2019s; forth of his pierced part came the woman of his dreams, blood thicker then water last trade overseas; buyshop of Glintylook, eorl of Hoed; you and I are in him surrented by brwn bldns; Elin\u2019s flee polt pelhaps but Hwang Chang evelytime; he one was your of highbigpipey boys but fancy him as smoking fags his at time of life; Mount of Mish, Mell of Moy; had two cardinal ventures and three capitol sinks; has a peep in his pocketbook and a packet-boat in his keep; B.V.H., B.L.G., P.P.M., T.D.S., V.B.D., T.C.H., L.O.N.; is Breakfates, Lunger, Diener and Souper; as the streets were paved with cold he felt his topperairy; taught himself skating and learned how to fall; distinctly dirty but rather a dear; hoveth chieftains evrywehr, with morder; Ostman Effendi, Serge Paddishaw; baases two mmany, outpriams al\u2019 his parisites; first of the fenians, roi des fain\u201aants; his Tiara of scones was held unfillable. till one Liam Fail felled him in West-munster; was struck out of his sittem when he rowed saulely to demask us and to our appauling predicament brought as plagues from Buddapest; put a matchhead on an aspenstalk and set the living a fire; speared the rod and spoiled the lightning; married with cakes and repunked with pleasure; till he was buried how-happy was he and he made the welkins ring with Up Micawber!; god at the top of the staircase, carrion on the mat of straw; the false hood of a spindler web chokes the cavemouth of his unsightliness but the nestlings that liven his leafscreen sing him a lover of arbuties; we strike hands over his bloodied warsheet but we are pledged entirely to his green mantle; our friend vikelegal, our swaran foi; under the four stones by his streams who vanished the wassailbowl at the joy of shells; Mora and Lora had a hill of a high time looking down on his confusion till firm look in readiness, forward spear and the windfoot of curach strewed the lakemist of Lego over the last of his fields; we darkened for you, faulterer, in the year of mourning but we\u2019ll fidhil to the dimtwinklers when the streamy morvenlight calls up the sunbeam; his striped pantaloons, his rather strange walk; hereditatis columna erecta, hagion chiton eraphon; nods a nap for the nonce but crows cheerio when they get ecunemical; is a simul-taneous equator of elimbinated integras when three upon one is by inspection improper; has the most conical hodpiece of confusianist heronim and that chuchuffuous chinchin of his is like a footsey kungoloo around Taishantyland; he\u2019s as globeful as a gasometer of lithium and luridity and he was thrice ten anular years before he wallowed round Raggiant Circos; the cabalstone at the coping of his cavin is a canine constant but only an amiri-can could apparoxemete the apeupresiosity of his atlast\u2019s alonge \u2014 ment; sticklered rights and lefts at Baddersdown in his hunt for the boar trwth but made his end with the modareds that came at him in Camlenstrete; a hunnibal in exhaustive conflict, an otho to return; burning body to aiger air on melting mountain in wooing wave; we go into him sleepy children, we come out of him strucklers for life; he divested to save from the Mrs Drown-ings their rival queens while Grimshaw, Bragshaw and Renshaw made off with his storen clothes; taxed and rated, licensed and ranted; his threefaced stonehead was found on a whitehorse hill and the print of his costellous feet is seen in the goat\u2019s grass-circle; pull the blind, toll the deaf and call dumb, lame and halty; Miraculone, Monstrucceleen; led the upplaws at the Creation and hissed a snake charmer off her stays; hounded become haunter, hunter become fox; harrier, marrier, terrier, tav; Olaph the Ox-man, Thorker the Tourable; you feel he is Vespasian yet you think of him as Aurelius; whugamore, tradertory, socianist, com-moniser; made a summer assault on our shores and begiddy got his sands full; first he shot down Raglan Road and then he tore up Marlborough Place; Cromlechheight and Crommalhill were his farfamed feetrests when our lurch as lout let free into the Lubar heloved; mareschalled his wardmotes and delimited the main; netted before nibbling, can scarce turn a scale but, grossed after meals, weighs a town in himself; Banba prayed for his conversion, Beurla missed that grand old voice; a Colossus among cabbages, the Melarancitrone of fruits; larger than life, doughtier than death; Gran Turco, orege forment; lachsembulger, leperlean; the sparkle of his genial fancy, the depth of his calm sagacity, the clearness of his spotless honour, the flow of his boundless bene-volence; our family furbear, our tribal tarnpike; quary was he invincibled and cur was he burked; partitioned Irskaholm, united Irishmen; he took a svig at his own methyr but she tested a bit gorky and as for the salmon he was coming up in him all life long; comm, eilerdich hecklebury and sawyer thee, warden; silent as the bee in honey, stark as the breath on hauwck, Cos-tello, Kinsella, Mahony, Moran, though you rope Amrique your home ruler is Dan; figure right, he is hoisted by the scurve of his shaggy neck, figure left, he is rationed in isobaric patties among the crew; one asks was he poisoned, one thinks how much did he leave; ex-gardener (Riesengebirger), fitted up with planturous existencies would make Roseoogreedy (mite\u2019s) little hose; taut sheets and scuppers awash but the oil silk mack Lieb- sterpet micks his aquascutum; the enjoyment he took in kay women, the employment he gave to gee men; sponsor to a squad of piercers, ally to a host of rawlies; against lightning, explosion, fire, earthquake, flood, whirlwind, burglary, third party, rot, loss of cash, loss of credit, impact of vehicles; can rant as grave as oxtail soup and chat as gay as a porto flippant; is unhesitent in his unionism and yet a pigotted nationalist; Sylviacola is shy of him, Matrosenhosens nose the joke; shows the sinews of peace in his chest-o-wars; fiefeofhome, ninehundred and thirtunine years of copyhold; is aldays open for polemypolity\u2019s sake when he\u2019s not suntimes closed for the love of Janus; sucks life\u2019s eleaxir from the pettipickles of the Jewess and ruoulls in sulks if any popeling runs down the Huguenots; Boomaport, Walleslee, Ubermeerschall Blowcher and Supercharger, Monsieur Ducrow, Mister Mudson, master gardiner; to one he\u2019s just paunch and judex, to another full of beans and brehons; hallucination, cauchman, ectoplasm; passed for baabaa blacksheep till he grew white woo woo woolly; was drummatoysed by Mac Milligan\u2019s daughter and put to music by one shoebard; all fitzpatricks in his emirate remember him, the boys of wetford hail him babu; indanified himself with boro tribute and was schenkt publicly to brigstoll; was given the light in drey orchafts and entumuled in threeplexes; his likeness is in Terrecuite and he giveth rest to the rainbowed; lebriety, frothearnity and quality; his reverse makes a virtue of necessity while his obverse mars a mother by invention; beskilk his gunwale and he\u2019s the second imperial, untie points, unhook tenters and he\u2019s lath and plaster; calls upon Allthing when he fails to appeal to Eachovos; basidens, ardree, kongsemma, rexregulorum; stood into Dee mouth, then backed broadside on Baulacleeva; either eldorado or ultimate thole; a kraal of fou feud fires, a crawl of five pubs; laid out lash-ings of laveries to hunt down his family ancestors and then pled double trouble or quick quits to hush the buckers up; threw peb-blets for luck over one sodden shoulder and dragooned peoplades armed to their teeth; pept as Gaudio Gambrinus, grim as Potter the Grave; ace of arts, deuce of damimonds, trouble of clubs, fear of spates; cumbrum, cumbrum, twiniceynurseys fore a drum but tre to uno tips the scale; reeled the titleroll opposite a brace of girdles in Silver on the Screen but was sequenced from the set as Crookback by the even more titulars, Rick, Dave and Barry; he can get on as early as the twentysecond of Mars but occasion-ally he doesn\u2019t come offbefore Virgintiquinque Germinal; his In \u2014 dian name is Hapapoosiesobjibway and his number in arithmo \u2014 sophy is the stars of the plough; took weapon in the province of the pike and let fling his line on Eelwick; moves in vicous cicles yet remews the same; the drain rats bless his offals while the park birds curse his floodlights; Portobello, Equadocta, Therecocta, Percorello; he pours into the softclad shellborn the hard cash earned in Watling Street; his birth proved accidental shows his death its grave mistake; brought us giant ivy from the land of younkers and bewitthered Apostolopolos with the gale of his gall; while satisfied that soft youthful bright matchless girls should bosom into fine silkclad joyous blooming young women is not so pleased that heavy swearsome strongsmelling irregularshaped men should blottout active handsome wellformed frankeyed boys; herald hairyfair, alloaf the wheat; husband your aunt and endow your nepos; hearken but hush it, screen him and see; time is, an archbishopric, time was, a tradesmen\u2019s entrance; beckburn brooked with wath, scale scarred by scow; his rainfall is a couple of kneehighs while his meanst grass temperature marked three in the shade; is the meltingpoint of snow and the bubblingplace of alcohol; has a tussle with the trulls and then does himself justice; hinted at in the eschatological chapters of Humphrey\u2019s Justesse of the Jaypees and hunted for by Theban recensors who sniff there\u2019s something behind the Bug of the Deaf; thc king was in his cornerwall melking mark so murry, the queen was steep in armbour feeling fain and furry, the mayds was midst the haw-thorns shoeing up their hose, out pimps the back guards (pomp!) and pump gun they goes; to all his foretellers he reared a stone and for all his comethers he planted a tree; forty acres, sixty miles, white stripe, red stripe, washes his fleet in annacrwatter; whou missed a porter so whot shall he do for he wanted to sit for Pimploco but they\u2019ve caught him to stand for Sue?; Dutchlord, Dutchlord, overawes us; Headmound, king and martyr, dunstung in the Yeast, Pitre-le-Pore-in Petrin, Barth-the-Grete-by-the-Exchange; he hestens towards dames troth and wedding hand like the prince of Orange and Nassau while he has trinity left behind him like Bowlbeggar Bill-the-Bustonly; brow of a hazel-wood, pool in the dark; changes blowicks into bullocks and a well of Artesia into a bird of Arabia; the handwriting on his facewall, the cryptoconchoidsiphonostomata in his exprussians; his birthspot lies beyond the herospont and his burialplot in the pleasant little field; is the yldist kiosk on the pleninsula and the unguest hostel in Saint Scholarland; walked many hundreds and many score miles of streets and lit thousands in one nightlights in hectares of windows;

Now open, pet, your lips, pepette, like I used my sweet parted lipsabuss with Dan Holohan of facetious memory taught me after the flannel dance, with the proof of love, up Smock Alley the first night he smelled pouder and I coloured beneath my fan, pipetta mia, when you learned me the linguo to melt. Whowham would have ears like ours, the blackhaired! Do you like that, silenzioso? Are you enjoying, this same little me, my life, my love? Why do you like my whisping? Is it not divinely deluscious? But in\u2019t it bafforyou? Misi misi! Tell me till my thrillme comes! I will not break the seal. I am enjoying it still, I swear I am! Why do you prefer its in these dark nets, if why may ask, my sweetykins? Sh sh! Long-ears is flying. No, sweetissest, why would that ennoy me? But don\u2019t! You want to be slap well slapped for that. Your delighted lips, love, be careful! Mind my duvetyne dress above all! It\u2019s golded silvy, the newest sextones with princess effect. For Rut-land blue\u2019s got out of passion. So, so, my precious! O, I can see the cost, chare! Don\u2019t tell me! Why, the boy in sheeps\u2019 lane knows that. If I sell whose, dears? Was I sold here\u2019 tears? You mean those conversation lozenges? How awful! The bold shame of me! I wouldn\u2019t, chickens, not for all the juliettes in the twinkly way! I could snap them when I see them winking at me in bed. I didn\u2019t did so, my intended, or was going to or thinking of. Shshsh! Don\u2019t start like that, you wretch! I thought ye knew all and more, ye aucthor, to explique to ones the significat of their exsystems with your nieu nivulon lead. It\u2019s only another queer fish or other in Brinbrou\u2019s damned old trouchorous river again, Gothewishegoths bless us and spare her! And gibos rest from the bosso! Excuse me for swearing, love, I swear to the sorrasims on their trons of Uian I didn\u2019t mean to by this alpin armlet! Did you really never in all our cantalang lives speak clothse to a girl\u2019s before? No! Not even to the charmermaid? How marfellows! Of course I believe you, my own dear doting liest, when you tell me. As I\u2019d live to, O, I\u2019d love to! Liss, liss! I muss whiss! Never that ever or I can remember dearstreaming faces, you may go through me! Never in all my whole white life of my match-less and pair. Or ever for bitter be the frucht of this hour!

If you met on the binge a poor acheseyeld from Ailing, when the tune of his tremble shook shimmy on shin, while his countrary raged in the weak of his wailing, like a rugilant pugi-lant Lyon O\u2019Lynn; if he maundered in misliness, plaining his plight or, played fox and lice, pricking and dropping hips teeth, or wringing his handcuffs for peace, the blind blighter, praying Dieuf and Domb Nostrums foh thomethinks to eath; if he weapt while he leapt and guffalled quith a quhimper, made cold blood a blue mundy and no bones without flech, taking kiss, kake or kick with a suck, sigh or simper, a diffle to larn and a dibble to lech; if the fain shinner pegged you to shave his immartial, wee skillmustered shoul with his ooh, hoodoodoo! brok \u2014 ing wind that to wiles, woemaid sin he was partial, we don\u2019t think, Jones, we\u2019d care to this evening, would you?\n\nAnswer: No, blank ye! So you think I have impulsivism? Did they tell you I am one of the fortysixths? And I suppose you heard I had a wag on my ears? And I suppose they told you too that my roll of life is not natural? But before proceeding to conclusively confute this begging question it would be far fitter for you, if you dare! to hasitate to consult with and consequentially attempt at my disposale of the same dime-cash problem elsewhere naturalistically of course, from the blinkpoint of so eminent a spatialist. From it you will here notice, Schott, upon my for the first remarking you that the sophology of Bitchson while driven as under by a purely dime-dime urge is not without his cashcash characktericksticks, borrowed for its nonce ends from the fiery goodmother Miss Fortune (who the lost time we had the pleasure we have had our little recherch\u201a brush with, what, Schott?) and as I further could have told you as brisk as your D.B.C. beha-viouristically paillet\u201a with a coat of homoid icing which is in reality only a done by chance ridiculisation of the whoo-whoo and where\u2019s hairs theorics of Winestain. To put it all the more plumbsily. The speechform is a mere sorrogate. Whilst the qua-lity and tality (I shall explex what you ought to mean by this with its proper when and where and why and how in the subsequent sentence) are alternativomentally harrogate and arrogate, as the gates may be.\n\nTalis is a word often abused by many passims (I am working out a quantum theory about it for it is really most tantumising state of affairs). A pessim may frequent you to say: Have you been seeing much of Talis and Talis those times? optimately meaning: Will you put up at hree of irish? Or a ladyeater may perhaps have casualised as you temptoed her \u2026 la sourdine: Of your plates? Is Talis de Talis, the swordswallower, who is on at the Craterium the same Talis von Talis, the penscrusher, no funk you! who runs his duly mile? Or this is a perhaps cleaner example. At a recent postvortex piece infustigation of a determinised case of chronic spinosis an extension lecturer on The Ague who out of matter of form was trying his seesers, Dr\u2019s Het Ubeleeft, borrowed the question: Why\u2019s which Suchman\u2019s talis qualis? to whom, as a fatter of macht, Dr Gedankje of Stoutgirth, who was wiping his whistle, toarsely retoarted: While thou beast\u2019 one zoom of a whorl!

Exaudi facts!\n\nThe Mookse and The Gripes.\n\nGentes and laitymen, fullstoppers and semicolonials, hybreds and lubberds!\n\nEins within a space and a wearywide space it wast ere wohned a Mookse. The onesomeness wast alltolonely, archunsitslike, broady oval, and a Mookse he would a walking go (My hood! cries Antony Romeo), so one grandsumer evening, after a great morning and his good supper of gammon and spittish, having flabelled his eyes, pilleoled his nostrils, vacticanated his ears and palliumed his throats, he put on his impermeable, seized his impugnable, harped on his crown and stepped out of his immobile De Rure Albo (socolled becauld it was chalkfull of masterplasters and had borgeously letout gardens strown with cascadas, pinta-costecas, horthoducts and currycombs) and set off from Luds \u2014 town a spasso to see how badness was badness in the weirdest of all pensible ways.\n\nAs he set off with his father\u2019s sword, his lancia spezzata, he was girded on, and with that between his legs and his tarkeels, our once in only Bragspear, he clanked, to my clinking, from veetoes to threetop, every inch of an immortal.\n\nHe had not walked over a pentiadpair of parsecs from his azylium when at the turning of the Shinshone Lanteran near Saint Bowery\u2019s-without-his-Walls he came (secunding to the one one oneth of the propecies, Amnis Limina Permanent) upon the most unconsciously boggylooking stream he ever locked his eyes with. Out of the colliens it took a rise by daubing itself Ni-non. It looked little and it smelt of brown and it thought in nar \u2014 rows and it talked showshallow. And as it rinn it dribbled like any lively purliteasy: My, my, my! Me and me! Little down dream don\u2019t I love thee!\nAnd, I declare, what was there on the yonder bank of the stream that would be a river, parched on a limb of the olum, bolt downright, but the Gripes? And no doubt he was fit to be dried for why had he not been having the juice of his times?\n\nHis pips had been neatly all drowned on him; his polps were charging odours every older minute; he was quickly for getting the dresser\u2019s desdaign on the flyleaf of his frons; and he was quietly for giving the bailiff\u2019s distrain on to the bulkside of his cul de Pompe. In all his specious heavings, as be lived by Opti-mus Maximus, the Mookse had never seen his Dubville brooder \u2014 on-low so nigh to a pickle.\nAdrian (that was the Mookse now\u2019s assumptinome) stuccstill phiz-\u2026-phiz to the Gripes in an accessit of aurignacian.

How do you do it? cheeped the Gripes in a wherry whiggy maudelenian woice and the jack- asses all within bawl laughed and brayed for his intentions for they knew their sly toad lowry now. I am rarumominum blessed to see you, my dear mouster. Will you not perhopes tell me everything if you are pleased, sanity? All about aulne and lithial and allsall allinall about awn and liseias?

To a Mookse!\n\n\u2014 Ask my index, mund my achilles, swell my obolum, wosh-up my nase serene, answered the Mookse, rapidly by turning clement, urban, eugenious and celestian in the formose of good grogory humours. Quote awhore? That is quite about what I came on my missions with my intentions laudibiliter to settle with you, barbarousse. Let thor be orlog. Let Pauline be Irene. Let you be Beeton.

How she was brightened when Should-rups in his glaubering hochskied his welkinstuck and how she was overclused when Kneesknobs on his zwivvel was makeacting such a paulse of himshelp! She was alone. All her nubied companions were asleeping with the squirrels. Their mivver, Mrs Moonan, was off in the Fuerst quarter scrubbing the back-steps of Number 28. Fuvver, that Skand, he was up in Norwood\u2019s sokaparlour, eating oceans of Voking\u2019s Blemish. Nuvoletta lis-tened as she reflected herself, though the heavenly one with his constellatria and his emanations stood between, and she tried all she tried to make the Mookse look up at her (but he was fore too adiaptotously farseeing) and to make the Gripes hear how coy she could be (though he was much too schystimatically auricular about his ens to heed her) but it was all mild\u2019s vapour moist. Not even her feignt reflection, Nuvoluccia, could they toke their gnoses off for their minds with intrepifide fate and bungless curiasity, were conclaved with Heliogobbleus and Commodus and Enobarbarus and whatever the coordinal dickens they did as their damprauch of papyrs and buchstubs said. As if that was their spiration! As if theirs could duiparate her queendim! As if she would be third perty to search on search proceedings! She tried all the winsome wonsome ways her four winds had taught her. She tossed her sfumastelliacinous hair like le princesse de la Petite Bretagne and she rounded her mignons arms like Mrs Cornwallis\u2013West and she smiled over herself like the beauty of the image of the pose of the daughter of the queen of the Em-perour of Irelande and she sighed after herself as were she born to bride with Tristis Tristior Tristissimus. But, sweet madonine, she might fair as well have carried her daisy\u2019s worth to Florida. For the Mookse, a dogmad Accanite, were not amoosed and the Gripes, a dubliboused Catalick, wis pinefully obliviscent.\n\nI see, she sighed. There are menner.\n\nThe siss of the whisp of the sigh of the softzing at the stir of the ver grose O arundo of a long one in midias reeds: and shades began to glidder along the banks, greepsing, greepsing, duusk unto duusk, and it was as glooming as gloaming could be in the waste of all peacable worlds. Metamnisia was allsoonome coloro-form brune; citherior spiane an eaulande, innemorous and un numerose. The Mookse had a sound eyes right but he could not all hear. The Gripes had light ears left yet he could but ill see. He ceased. And he ceased, tung and trit, and it was neversoever so dusk of both of them. But still Moo thought on the deeps of the undths he would profoundth come the morrokse and still Gri feeled of the scripes he would escipe if by grice he had luck enoupes.\n\nOh, how it was duusk! From Vallee Maraia to Grasyaplaina, dormimust echo! Ah dew! Ah dew! It was so duusk that the tears of night began to fall, first by ones and twos, then by threes and fours, at last by fives and sixes of sevens, for the tired ones were wecking, as we weep now with them. O! O! O! Par la pluie!\n\nThen there came down to the thither bank a woman of no appearance (I believe she was a Black with chills at her feet) and she gathered up his hoariness the Mookse motamourfully where he was spread and carried him away to her invisible dwelling, thats hights, Aquila Rapax, for he was the holy sacred solem and poshup spit of her boshop\u2019s apron. So you see the Mookse he had reason as I knew and you knew and he knew all along. And there came down to the hither bank a woman to all important (though they say that she was comely, spite the cold in her heed) and, for he was as like it as blow it to a hawker\u2019s hank, she plucked down the Gripes, torn panicky autotone, in angeu from his limb and cariad away its beotitubes with her to her unseen shieling, it is, De Rore Coeli. And so the poor Gripes got wrong; for that is always how a Gripes is, always was and always will.be. And it was never so thoughtful of either of them. And there were left now an only elmtree and but a stone. Polled with pietrous, Sierre but saule. O! Yes! And Nuvoletta, a lass.\n\nThen Nuvoletta reflected for the last time in her little long life and she made up all her myriads of drifting minds in one. She cancelled all her engauzements. She climbed over the bannistars; she gave a childy cloudy cry: Nu\u201ae! Nu\u201ae! A lightdress fluttered. She was gone. And into the river that had been a stream (for a thousand of tears had gone eon her and come on her and she was stout and struck on dancing and her muddied name was Missis-liffi) there fell a tear, a singult tear, the loveliest of all tears (I mean for those crylove fables fans who are \u2018keen\u2019 on the pretty-pretty commonface sort of thing you meet by hopeharrods) for it was a leaptear. But the river tripped on her by and by, lapping as though her heart was brook: Why, why, why! Weh, O weh I\u2019se so silly to be flowing but I no canna stay!\n\nNo applause, please! Bast!

But I further, feeling a bit husky in my truths.\n\nWill you please come over and let us mooremoore murgessly to each\u2019s other down below our vices. I am underheerd by old billfaust. Wilsh is full of curks. The coolskittle is philip debli-nite. Mr Wist is thereover beyeind the wantnot. Wilsh and wist are as thick of thins udder as faust on the deblinite. Sgunoshooto estas preter la tapizo malgranda. Lilegas al si en sia chambro. Kelkefoje funcktas, kelkefoje srumpas Shultroj. Houdian Kiel vi fartas, mia nigra sinjoro? And from the poignt of fun where I am crying to arrive you at they are on allfore as foibleminded as you can feel they are fablebodied.\n\nMy heeders will recoil with a great leisure how at the out-break before trespassing on the space question where even michelangelines have fooled to dread I proved to mindself as to your sotisfiction how his abject all through (the quickquid of Pro-fessor Ciondolone\u2019s too frequently hypothecated Bettlermensch) is nothing so much more than a mere cashdime however genteel he may want ours, if we please (I am speaking to us in the second person), for to this graded intellecktuals dime is cash and the cash system (you must not be allowed to forget that this is all contained, I mean the system, in the dogmarks of origen on spurios) means that I cannot now have or nothave a piece of cheeps in your pocket at the same time and with the same man-ners as you can now nothalf or half the cheek apiece I\u2019ve in mind unless Burrus and Caseous have not or not have seemaultaneous-ly sysentangled themselves, selldear to soldthere, once in the dairy days of buy and buy.\nBurrus, let us like to imagine, is a genuine prime, the real choice, full of natural greace, the mildest of milkstoffs yet unbeaten as a risicide and, of course, obsoletely unadulterous whereat Caseous is obversely the revise of him and in fact not an ideal choose by any meals, though the betterman of the two is meltingly addicted to the more casual side of the arrivaliste case and, let me say it at once, as zealous over him as is passably he. The seemsame home and histry seeks and hidepence which we used to be reading for our prepurgatory, hot, Schott? till Duddy shut the shopper op and Mutti, poor Mutti! brought us our poor suppy, (ah who! eh how!) in Acetius and Oleosus and Sellius Volatilis and Petrus Papricus! Our Old Party quite united round the Slatbowel at Commons: Pfarrer Salamoss himself and that sprog of a Pedersill and his Sprig of Thyme and a dozen of the Murphybuds and a score and more of the hot young Capels and Lettucia in her greensleeves and you too and me three, twinsome bibs but hansome ates, like shakespill and eggs! But there\u2019s many a split pretext bowl and jowl; and (snob screwing that cork, Schott!) to understand this as well as you can, feeling how back-ward you are in your down-to-the-ground benches, I have com \u2014 pleted the following arrangement for the coarse use of stools and if I don\u2019t make away with you I\u2019m beyond Caesar outnullused\nThe older sisars (Tyrants, regicide is too good for you!) be-come unbeurrable from age, (the compositor of the farce of dustiny however makes a thunpledrum mistake by letting off this pienofarte effect as his furst act as that is where the juke comes in) having been sort-of-nineknived and chewly removed (this soldier \u2014 author \u2014 batman for all his commontoryism is just another of those souftsiezed bubbles who never quite got the sandhurst out of his eyes so that the champaign he draws for us is as flop as a plankrieg) the twinfreer types are billed to make their reupprearance as the knew kneck and knife knickknots on the deserted champ de bouteilles. (A most cursery reading into the Persic\u2013Uraliens hostery shows us how Fonnumagula picked up that propper numen out of a colluction of prifixes though to the permienting cannasure the Coucousien oafsprung of this sun of a kuk is as sattin as there\u2019s a tub in Tobolosk) Ostiak della Vogul Marina! But that I dannoy the fact of wanton to weste point I could paint you to that butter (cheese it!) if you had some wash. Mordvealive! Oh me none onsens! Why the case is as inessive and impossive as kezom hands! Their inter-locative is conprovocative just as every hazzy hates to having a hazbane in her noze. Caseous may bethink himself a thought of a caviller but Burrus has the reachly roundered head that goes best with thofthinking defensive fideism. He has the lac of wis-dom under every dent in his lofter while the other follow\u2019s onni vesy milky indeedmymy. Laughing over the linnuts and weeping off the uniun. He hisn\u2019t the hey og he lisn\u2019t the lug, poohoo. And each night sim misses mand he winks he had the semagen. It was aptly and corrigidly stated (and, it is royally needless for one ex ungue Leonem to say by whom) that his seeingscraft was that clarety as were the wholeborough of Poutres-bourg to be averlaunched over him pitchbatch he could still make out with his augstritch the green moat in Ireland\u2019s Eye. Let me sell you the fulltroth of Burrus when he wore a younker. Here it is, and chorming too, in six by sevens! A cleanly line, by the gods! A king off duty and a jaw for ever! And what a cheery ripe outlook, good help me Deus v Deus! If I were to speak my ohole mouthful to arinam about it you should call me the ormuzd aliment in your midst of faime. Eat ye up, heat ye up! sings the somun in the salm. Butyrum et mel comedet ut sciat reprobare malum et eligere bonum. This, of course, also explains why we were taught to play in the childhood: Der Haensli ist ern Butterbrot, mein Butterbrot! Und Koebi iss dein Schtinkenkot! Ja! Ja! Ja!\n\nThis in fact, just to show you, is Caseous, the brutherscutch or puir tyron: a hole or two, the highstinks aforefelt and anygo prigging wurms. Cheesugh! you complain. And Hi Hi High must say you are not Hoa Hoa Hoally in the wrong!\n\nThus we cannot escape our likes and mislikes, exiles or am-busheers, beggar and neighbour and \u2014 this is where the dime \u2014 show advertisers advance the temporal relief plea \u2014 let us be tolerant of antipathies. Nex quovis burro num fit mercaseus? I am not hereby giving my final endorsement to the learned ignorants of the Cusanus philosophism in which old Nicholas pegs it down that the smarter the spin of the top the sounder the span of the buttom (what the worthy old auberginiste ought to have meant was: the more stolidly immobile in space appears to me the bottom which is presented to use in time by the top primo-mobilisk &c.). And I shall be misunderstord if understood to give an unconditional sinequam to the heroicised furibouts of the Nolanus theory, or, at any rate, of that substrate of apart from hissheory where the Theophil swoors that on principial he was the pointing start of his odiose by comparison and that whiles eggs will fall cheapened all over the walled the Bure will be dear on the Brie.\n\nNow, while I am not out now to be taken up as unintention-ally recommending the Silkebjorg tyrondynamon machine for the more economical helixtrolysis of these amboadipates until I can find space to look into it myself a little more closely first I shall go on with my decisions after having shown to you in good time how both products of our social stomach (the excellent Dr Burroman, I noticed by the way from his emended food theory, has been carefully digesting the very wholesome criticism I helped him to in my princeps edition which is all so munch to the cud) are mutuearly polarised the incompatabilily of any delusional acting as ambivalent to the fixation of his pivotism. Positing, as above, too males pooles, the one the pictor of the other and the omber the Skotia of the one, and looking want-ingly around our undistributed middle between males we feel we must waistfully woent a female to focus and on this stage there pleasantly appears the cowrymaid M. whom we shall often meet below who introduces herself upon us at some precise hour which we shall again agree to call absolute zero or the babbling pumpt of platinism. And so like that former son of a kish who went up and out to found his farmer\u2019s ashes we come down home gently on our own turnedabout asses to meet Margareen.\n\nWe now romp through a period of pure lyricism of shame-bred music (technologically, let me say, the appetising entry of this subject on a fool chest of vialds is plumply pudding the carp before doevre hors) evidenced by such words in distress as I cream for thee, Sweet Margareen, and the more hopeful O Mar-gareena! O Margareena! Still in the bowl is left a lump of gold! (Correspondents, by the way, will keep on asking me what is the correct garnish to serve drisheens with. Tansy Sauce. Enough). The pawnbreaking pathos of the first of these shoddy pieces reveals it as a Caseous effort. Burrus\u2019s bit is often used for a toast. Criniculture can tell us very precisely indeed how and why this particular streak of yellow silver first appeared on (not in) the bowel, that is to see, the human head, bald, black, bronze, brown, brindled, betteraved or blanchemanged where it might be use-fully compared with an earwig on a fullbottom. I am offering this to Signorina Cuticura and I intend to take it up and bring it under the nosetice of Herr Harlene by way of diverting his attentions. Of course the unskilled singer continues to pervert our wiser ears by subordinating the space-element, that is to sing, the aria, to the time-factor, which ought to be killed, ill tempor. I should advise any unborn singer who may still be among my heeders to forget her temporal diaphragm at home (the best thing that could happen to it!) and attack the roulade with a swift colpo di glottide to the lug (though Maace I will insist was reclined from overdoing this, his recovery often being slow) and then, O! on the third dead beat, O! to cluse her eyes and aiopen her oath and see what spice I may send her. How? Cease thee, cantatrickee! I fain would be solo. Arouse thee, my valour! And save for e\u2019er my true Bdur!\n\nI shall have a word to say in a few yards about the acoustic and orchidectural management of the tonehall but, as ours is a vivarious where one plant\u2019s breaf is a lunger planner\u2019s byscent and you may not care for argon, it will be very convenient for me for the emolument to pursue Burrus and Caseous for a rung or two up their isocelating biangle. Every admirer has seen my goulache of Marge (she is so like the sister, you don\u2019t know, and they both dress A L I K E!) which I titled The Very Picture of a Needlesswoman which in the presence ornates our national cruetstand. This genre of portraiture of changes of mind in order to be truly torse should evoke the bush soul of females so I am leaving it to the experienced victim to complete the general suggestion by the mental addition of a wallopy bound or, should the zulugical zealot prefer it, a congorool teal. The hatboxes which composed Rhomba, lady Trabezond (Marge in her ex-celsis), also comprised the climactogram up which B and C may fondly be imagined ascending and are suggestive of gentlemen\u2019s spring modes, these modes carrying us back to the superimposed claylayers of eocene and pleastoseen formation and the gradual morphological changes in our body politic which Professor Ebahi\u2013Ahuri of Philadespoinis (Ill) \u2014 whose bluebutterbust I have just given his coupe de grass to \u2014 neatly names a bo\u0152te \u2026 surprises. The boxes, if I may break the subject gently, are worth about fourpence pourbox but I am inventing a more patent pro-cess, foolproof and pryperfect (I should like to ask that Shedlock Homes person who is out for removing the roofs of our criminal classics by what deductio ad domunum he hopes de tacto to detect anything unless he happens of himself, movibile tectu, to have a slade off) after which they can be reduced to a fragment of their true crust by even the youngest of Margees if she will take plase to be seated and smile if I please.\n\nNow there can be no question about it either that I having done as much, have quite got the size of that demilitery young female (we will continue to call her Marge) whose types may be met with in any public garden, wearing a very \u201cdressy\u201d affair, known as an \u201cethel\u201d of instep length and with a real fur, reduced to 3/9, and muffin cap to tone (they are \u201cangelskin\u201d this fall), ostentatiously hemming apologetically over the shirtness of some \u201csweet\u201d garment, when she is not sitting on all the free benches avidously reading about \u201cit\u201d but ovidently on the look out for \u201chim\u201d or so \u201cthrilled\u201d about the best dressed dolly pram and beautiful elbow competition or at the movies swallowing sobs and blowing bixed mixcuits over \u201cchilde\u201d chaplain\u2019s \u201clatest\u201d or on the verge of the gutter with some bobbedhair brieffrocked babyma\u2019s toddler (the Smythe\u2013Smythes now keep TWO domes-tics and aspire to THREE male ones, a shover, a butlegger and a sectary) held hostage at armslength, teaching His Infant Majesty how to make waters worse.\n\n(I am closely watching Master Pules, as I have regions to sus-pect from my post that her \u201clitde man\u201d is a secondary school \u2014 teacher under the boards of education, a voted disciple of Infan \u2014 tulus who is being utilised thus publicly by the seducente infanta to conceal her own more mascular personality by flaunting frivolish finery over men\u2019s inside clothes, for the femininny of that totamulier will always lack the musculink of a verumvirum. My solotions for the proper parturience of matres and the edu-cation of micturious mites must stand over from the moment till I tackle this tickler hussy for occupying my uttentions.)\n\nMargareena she\u2019s very fond of Burrus but, alick and alack! she velly fond of chee. (The important influence exercised on everything by this eastasian import has not been till now fully flavoured though we can comfortably taste it in this case. I shall come back for a little more say farther on.) A cleopatrician in her own right she at once complicates the position while Burrus and Caseous are contending for her misstery by implicating her- self with an elusive Antonius, a wop who would appear to hug a personal interest in refined chees of all chades at the same time as he wags an antomine art of being rude like the boor. This Antonius\u2013Burrus-Caseous grouptriad may be said to equate the qualis equivalent with the older socalled talis on talis one just as quantly as in the hyperchemical economantarchy the tan-tum ergons irruminate the quantum urge so that eggs is to whey as whay is to zeed like your golfchild\u2019s abe boob caddy. And this is why any simple philadolphus of a fool you like to dress, an athemisthued lowtownian, exlegged phatrisight, may be awfully green to one side of him and fruitfully blue on the other which will not screen him however from appealing to my gropesarching eyes, through the strongholes of my acropoll, as a boosted blasted bleating blatant bloaten blasphorus blesphorous idiot who kennot tail a bomb from a painapple when he steals one and wannot psing his psalmen with the cong in our gregational pompoms with the canting crew.\n\nNo! Topsman to your Tarpeia! This thing, Mister Abby, is nefand. (And, taking off soutstuffs and alkalike matters, I hope we can kill time to reach the salt because there\u2019s some forceglass neutric assets bittering in the soldpewter for you to plump your pottage in). The thundering legion has stormed Olymp that it end. Twelve tabular times till now have I edicted it. Merus Genius to Careous Caseous! Moriture, te salutat! My phemous themis race is run, so let Demoncracy take the highmost! (Abra-ham Tripier. Those old diligences are quite out of date. Read next answer). I\u2019ll beat you so lon. (Bigtempered. Why not take direct action. See previous reply). My unchanging Word is sacred. The word is my Wife, to exponse and expound, to vend and to velnerate, and may the curlews crown our nuptias! Till Breath us depart! Wamen. Beware would you change with my years. Be as young as your grandmother! The ring man in the rong shop but the rite words by the rote order! Ubi lingua nuncupassit, ibi fas! Adversus hostem semper sac! She that will not feel my ful-moon let her peel to thee as the hoyden and the impudent! That mon that hoth no moses in his sole nor is not awed by conquists of word\u2019s law, who never with humself was fed and leaves his soil to lave his head, when his hope\u2019s in his highlows from whisking his woe, if he came to my preach, a proud pursebroken ranger, when the heavens were welling the spite of their spout, to beg for a bite in our bark Noisdanger, would meself and Mac Jeffet, four-inhand, foot him out? \u2014 ay! \u2014 were he my own breastbrother, my doubled withd love and my singlebiassed hate, were we bread by the same fire and signed with the same salt, had we tapped from the same master and robbed the same till, were we tucked in the one bed and bit by the one flea, homo-gallant and hemycapnoise, bum and dingo, jack by churl, though it broke my heart to pray it, still I\u2019d fear I\u2019d hate to say!\n\n12.

Lyrics{Intro}\n\n[Verse 1]\nIn the cool of the evening\nWhen everything is getting kinda groovy\nI call you up and ask you\nWould you like to go with me and see a movie\nAt first you say no you've got some plans for tonight\nAnd then you stop and say, \"alright\"\nLove is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you\n[Verse 2]\nYou always keep me guessing\nI never seem to know what you are thinking\nAnd if a fellow looks at you\nYou'd be sure your little eye will be a-winking\nI get confused cause I don't know where I stand\nAnd then you smile and hold my hand\nLove is kinda crazy with a spooky little girl like you\nSpooky!\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf you decide someday\nTo stop this little game that you are playing\nI'm gonna tell you all the things\nMy heart's been a-dying to be saying\nJust like a ghost\nYou've been a-haunting my dreams\nSo I propose on Halloween\nLove is kinda crazy\nWith a spooky little girl like you\n\n[Outro]\nSpooky!\nSpooky!\nI said  Spooky...You
