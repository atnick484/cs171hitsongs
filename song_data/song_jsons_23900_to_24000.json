\"Respectfully,\" I just want my respect\nThey tried to label me mean, I say what I mean\nPeople that could've stayed on the team\nThey played in-between\nClouds is hanging over you now, 'cause I'm reigning supreme\nSome of these niggas say what they mean, it ain't what it seems\nHad to pull my niggas out the mud like I'm trainin' Marines\nYou niggas hot to them little kids, you ain't famous to me\nTold you I'm aimin' straight for the head, not aiming to please\nI could give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and tees\nHave somebody put you on a Gildan, you play with my seed\nTrust me, there's some shit you really gotta come see to believe\nThat's why your people not believers, they all leavin' ya\nThat's why you buyin' into the hype that the press feedin' ya\nYou know the fourth level of jealousy is called media\nIsn't that an ironic revelation?\nGive that address to your driver, make it your destination\n'Stead of just a post out of desperation\nThis me reachin' the deepest state of my meditation\nWhile you over there tryna impress the nation\nMind's runnin' wild with the speculation\nWhy the fuck we peacemakin', doin' the explanations\nIf we just gon' be right back in that bitch without hesitation?\nBut let me digress on behalf of the association\nI'll play it cool with you, then mark a nigga like Copenhagen\nSee, they gettin' loose with the line like open cages\nIn the La Ferrari, my emotions racin', dancin' out a condo, ocean bathin'\nNiggas textin' \"Bro,\" but we are not of no close relation\nI was down to give these niggas credit, but hold the

if we play it right\"\nJust keep on bein' the voice, I'll be the hero\nAnd everything I got is a profit, started with zero\nI can never turn my back on my apartment, that's where I come from\nAnd I'm just gettin' started, relax, wait 'til I warm up\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Lil Durk]\nI done been to jail too many times, it feel like karma\nEverywhere I sleep, I keep my stick, what I need an alarm for?\nPolice caught me in the cut, I had to walk out with my arms up\nAin't too big to pray last minute, I put my palms up\nYeah, flood my system with these Percies\nTook the bitch to eat out at Thirteen, she was squirtin'\nI just cashed out on my bitch, Celine to match her Birkin\nAll this shit these bitches textin' me, just do it in person\n\n[Verse 4: Lil Baby]\nYeah, I might pop a half an Adderall, I don't like Percies\nPut the phone on DND, I'm somewhere in her cervix\nI just slimed a nigga out today but it was worth it\nI switch cars like bitches switch they purses\nI slow down on features, I do verses if they worth it now\nThis shit done got deep and it's beyond us, we can't work it out\nPeeped that lately you been actin' funny, wonder what it's 'bout\nThis shit really in me, hope you never doubt it, on gang\n\n[Chorus: Lil Durk]\nVoice of the heroes\nI'm the voice of the heroes\nVoice of the heroes\nVoice of the heroes\nSee, I'm the voice, Baby, he the hero\nBaby, he the hero\nI'm the voice, but Baby, he the hero\nBut Baby, he the hero12Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 10, "api_path": "/songs/6702222", "artist_names": "Olivia Rodrigo", "full_title":

salt\nHe played the drum in the marching band\nHis parents cared more about the Bible\nThan being good to their own child\nHe wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad\nAnd somehow, we fell out of touch\nHope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush\nDon't know if I'll see you again someday\nBut if you're out there, I hope that you're okay\n[Verse 2]\nMy middle school friend grew up alone\nShe raised her brothers on h\u0435r own\nHer parents hated who sh\u0435 loved\nShe couldn't wait to go to college\nShe was tired 'cause she was brought into a world\nWhere family was merely blood\nDoes she know how proud I am she was created\nWith the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?\nWe don't talk much, but I just gotta say\nI miss you and I hope that you're okay\n\n[Bridge]\nAddress the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings\nNothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems\nAnd when the clouds won't iron out\nAnd the monsters creep into your house\nAnd every door is hard to close\n\n[Outro]\nWell, I hope you know how proud I am you were created\nWith the courage to unlearn all of their hatred\nBut, God, I hope that you're happier today\n'Cause I love you\nAnd I hope that you're okayYou might also like94Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/7806545", "artist_names": "Apollontheone (Ft.

You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed\"\nI shake my head in frustration\nHead to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut\nFuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone\nOff to college and dorms\nFoolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone\nBut now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone\nI know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down\nShe lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed\nBut I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds\nThinkin' to myself, \"Maybe my mama need help\nDon't she got work in the morning?\nWhy she do this to herself?\nHate how she slurrin' her words\nSoundin' so fuckin' absurd\nThis ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?\nWhy don't I say how I feel?\nWhen I do, she's defensive for real\nWell maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals\nLittle did I know how deep her sadness would go\nLookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'\nYou might also like[Outro]\nSomething's got a hold on me\nI can't let it go\nOut of fear I won't be free\nSomething's got a hold on me\nI can't let it go\nOut of fear I won't be\u2014\nNo!\nSomething's got a hold on me\nI can't let it

Lyrics[Intro: Future]\n(Wheezy outta here)\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott]\nSolitary diamonds, solitary jewels\nWith a bitch that's shinin', lookin' like the moon\nSaid she\u2005wanna\u2005party, wanna let\u2005it loose\nBustin' out my back room,\u2005she ain't out the loop\nIt's jumpin', let it in (Ooh)\nI\u205fput\u205fit\u205fout, they come\u205fin (Ooh)\n[Verse 1: Future & Travis Scott]\nCame up\u205foff a brick\nBought a Richard Mille, my new watch don't tick\nDrippin' in Louis V, made a movie, and Prada another film\nIt's the Don Dada, I stand this Lamborghini on one wheel\nTwelve o'clock, and I got my gun clocked, and I'm on one pill\nMonday all the way to Sunday, pick a time to drill\nGettin' my lettuce, I'm gettin' my paper, I'm gettin' my trees (Woo, woo)\nOne thousand percent, keep it one thousand with me (Woo, woo, yeah)\nStarted with my squad, so I can't chill\nMoney over bitches, gotta play the field\nCoronavirus diamonds, you can catch the flu\nTrap in bandos, walk in Jimmy Choo\nSolitaries made a rockstar too (Ooh)\nSolitary diamonds, I can show proof (Ooh)\nThat these bitches on me just like a pop group\nI got racks on my mind and I can't lose (Yeah)\nAnd I got solitary diamonds, solitary jewels\nWatches full of baguettes, pockets full of blue (Yeah)\nSolitary diamonds, solitary jewels\nGirls gettin' naked in my swimming pool (Yeah)\nI wanna take care you and your friends (Yeah)\n\n[Refrain: Travis Scott]\nOoh\nI put it out, they come in\nOoh (It's lit)\nRadical decisions what we always choose\nAll the dogs is hungry and they sellin' food (Yeah)\nEvery time we do it, tend to hit the news\nI don't want it if it's stiff or if that pussy loose\nRunnin', know they gunnin' 'cause I got the juice\nI been thuggin' since a youngin, brought that work to school\nFloodin' all the hundreds, we done broke the pool\nAll this money bring the power, I didn't make the rules (Let's go)\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Future & Travis Scott]\nSipping on codeine got my screws loose\nMaking all this money got my screws loose (Yeah)\nRidin' Lamborgini made her pussy juicy\nGrippin' on the wheel, playin' in her pussy\nDiamonds on my neck been going crazy\nI think I need to see a psychiatrist (Ooh)\nLiving in the streets and the gutter raised me\nI know how to sell narcotics (Yeah)\n\n[Verse 3: Travis Scott]\nWhen they let us off of lock', man, we gon' make that shit pop\nBeen humpin' wifey for so long, she got a limp when she walk\nGot seven drops in four spots, I get to pick where I live\nIn the back they playin' twinsies like a Hugh Hefner zoo\nOn my teeth, these diamonds twinkle, in her legs a jacuzzi\nI be tweakin' every day, I got some screws missin'\nI keep an Air Max pump on me, no, not my 270s (Yeah)\nAnd they know just where I be, it's like I'm 713 (Yeah)\nHavin' money on this side is not the conversation (Yeah, yeah)\nSolitary diamonds for my dawg inside, he waited, yeah (Straight up)\n\n[Chorus: Travis Scott & Future]\nSolitary diamonds, solitary jewels\nWith a bitch that's shinin', lookin' like the moon\nSaid she wanna party, wanna let it loose\nBustin' out my back room, she ain't out to loop\nI wanna take care you and your friends (Ooh)\nI put it out, they come in (Ooh)39Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/5522272", "artist_names": "Genius Russian Translations

there\nLike\u2005a friend I've always known\nI'm arriving\nAnd it feels like I am home\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Elsa]\nI have always been a fortress\nCold secrets deep inside\nYou have secrets, too\nBut you don't have to hide\n[Chorus 1: Elsa, Siren]\nShow yourself\nI'm dying to meet you\nShow yourself\nIt's your turn\nAre you the one I've been looking for\nAll of my life?\nShow yourself\nI'm ready to learn\nAh-ah, ah-ah\nAh-ah, ah-ah-ah\n\n[Verse 2: Elsa]\nI've never felt so certain\nAll my life I've been torn\nBut I'm here for a reason\nCould it be the reason I was born?\nI have always been so different\nNormal rules did not apply\nIs this the day?\nAre you the way\nI finally find out why?\n\n[Chorus 2: Elsa]\nShow yourself\nI'm no longer trembling\nHere I am\nI've come so far\nYou are the answer I've waited for\nAll of my life\nOh, show yourself\nLet me see who you are\nYou might also like[Bridge: Elsa]\nCome to me now\nOpen your door\nDon't make me wait\nOne moment more\nOh, come to

Really?\nMy depositions never surface\nTanenbaum know the logo on the jersey, it's gettin' purchased\nTen years in and y'all yet to hear my most impressive verses\nPaid the cost to be the boss wasn't even my most expensive purchase\nTrust when I say I'm never on the shit they assumin' I'm on\nTales about me are like corridos in Culiac\u00e1n\nSashimi from Saito, you know that man two Michelin Star\nPostcard from Grace Bay, sendin' my distant regards\nVision wasn't mine, told my niggas the vision was ours\nStill a part of shorty even if we've been livin' apart\nRoxx'll do you filthy for me soon as I give him the nod\nMeanin' he'll blast for me like puttin' the 6 with the God\nHop on a float to show the city the one they appointed\nThe one that's rebuildin' schools and feedin' the homeless\nHang with my niggas, but sometimes I be tryna avoid it\n'Cause they'll get to poppin' out of place like they double jointed\nGoals was the top of the pyramid in this shitty world\n\"I gotta get the most of everything\" is the axis on which it sit and twirls\nPoint blank period, like a City Girl and then I bring it back to 50 world\n[Chorus: Drake & Rick Ross]\nAyy, woah\nYou made me this way, yeah\nBefore I'm gone outta this place, yeah\nPut some flowers in my vase, won't you?\nLet me know that I did okay, yeah\nDon't wait 'til some other day, no, no\nThey love to wait 'til it's too late, it's too late\nThis different right here, yo\n\n[Verse 2: Rick Ross]\nI was nominated, never won a Grammy\nBut I understand, they'll never understand me\nLot of lives lost, but I never panicked\nLot of lines crossed, I never did a Xanny\nA hundred room mansion but I felt abandoned\nLove makin' love, but where will love land me?\nJealous, so their bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us\nBut they speakin' on us, jewelers quote us even numbers\nStill blowin' smoke as angels float above us\nLove givin' back, but will they ever love us?\nChanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell\nAnd what I got for sale just sit on the scale\nTriple beam dream, a buck on the shades\nI really seen things give mothers the shakes\nI really bought cars for women on face\nI know it seem odd, but money amazin'\nCollege loans really did fuck up her credit\nDiscover cards, look back, I know she regret it\nBut we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal\nIn the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil\nLivin' on the edge, she keepin' me level\nMoney come and go, I'ma keep you forever\nMoney come and go, I'ma keep you forever (Forever)\nSlip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers\nEverywhere we go, we create a dilemma\nComing to America, really the set\nI'll let your soul glow, I'm keepin' you wet\nAll my cold Decembers, I know she remembers\nForgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?\nHoldin' on your hands, your body's a temple\nFly you out to Cannes, m\u00e9nages with bitches\nLobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish\nBottles for the Don, our parties the biggest (Biggest, biggest)\n(Maybach Music)\nYou might also like[Chorus: Drake]\nAyy, woah\nYou made me this way, yeah\nBefore I'm gone outta this place, yeah\nPut some flowers in my vase,

I was jackin' cars\nI couldn't get all my time 'cause I was doin' fraud\nMe and my nigga Lil' Marcus tearin' up the Wyatt\nIt hurt me to my heart, heard they gave him 25\nI'm from the Noya, all I know

inside\nWake me when the shakes are gone\nAnd the cold sweats disappear\nCall me when it's over and myself has reappeared\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why\nI do it every, every, every time\nIt's only when I'm lonely\nSometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight\nI try and I try and I try and I try and I try\nJust hold me, I'm lonely\n[Chorus]\nMomma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore\nAnd daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor\nTo the ones who never left me, we've been down this road before\nI'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm sorry to my future love for the man that left my bed\nFor making love the way I saved for you inside my head\nAnd I'm sorry for the fans I lost who watched me fall again\nI wanna be a role model, but I'm only human\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know why\nI do it every, every, every time\nIt's only when I'm lonely\nSometimes I just wanna cave and I don't wanna fight\nI try and I try and I try and I try and I try\nJust hold me, I'm lonely\n\n[Chorus]\nMomma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore\nAnd daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor\nTo the ones who never left me, we've been down this road before\nI'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore\nI\u2019m not sober anymore\nYou might also
