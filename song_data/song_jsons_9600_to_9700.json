lost\nWith the dreams you lightly sold\nAre you under\nThe power of gold?\n[Refrain]\nThe power of gold\n\n[Verse 2:]\nThe letters and calls\nGot you climbing the walls\nAnd everyone wants a favor\nThey beg to remind you\nOf times left behind you\nBut you know the past is a loser\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nThe face you're wearing is different now\nAnd the days run hot and cold\nAre you under\nThe power of gold?\n\n[Refrain]\nThe power of gold\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou're a creature of habit\nRun like a rabbit\nScared of a fear you can't name\nYour own paranoia\nIs looming before you\nBut nobody thinks that\nIt's a game\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus 3]\nBalance the cost of the soul you lost\nWith the dreams you lightly sold\nThen tell me\nThat you're free\nOf the power of gold\n\n[Outro]\nThe

case\n\n[Hook]\nI'll take those long nights, impossible odds\nKeeping my eye to the keyhole\nIf it takes all that to be just what I am\nI'm gonna be a blue collar man\n[Verse 2]\nMake me an offer that I can't refuse\nMake me respectable, man\nThis is my last time in the unemployment line\nSo like it or not, I'll take those\n\n[Chorus]\nLong nights, impossible odds\nKeeping my back to the wall\nIf it takes all that to be just what I am\nI'm gonna be a blue collar man\n\n[Bridge 1]\nKeeping my mind on a better life\nWhere happiness is only a heartbeat away\nParadise, can it be all I heard it was\nI close my eyes and maybe I'm already there\n\nOoh yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll take those long nights, impossible odds\nKeeping my back to the wall\nAll that to be just what I am\nI'm gonna be a blue

LyricsEXT. MANHATTAN ISLAND - DAY\n\nA high AERIAL SHOT of the island features the Statue of Liberty\nprominently in the foreground then TRAVELS ACROSS the harbor, OVER the\nBattery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DAY\n\nA car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is\nhaving a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement officer.\nDANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy, struggling with two full\nbags of groceries, and trying to dig her keys out of her purse. The\nbuilding superintendent FRANK, sees her struggling but pretends not to\nnotice.\n\nDANA\n(exasperated)\nFrank, do you think you could give me a hand\nwith these bags?\n\nFRANK\nI'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett. I'm a\nbuilding superintendent.\n\nDANA\nYou're also a human being, Frank.\n\nFRANK\n(reluctantly going to help)\nOkay, okay. It's not my job, but what the\nhell. I'll do you a favor. He takes the\ngrocery bags from her.\n\nDANA\n(setting the wheel brakes on\nthe buggy)\nThank you, Frank. I'll get the hang of this\neventually.\nShe continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy and\nmakes funny faces at the baby, OSCAR, a very cute nine-month old boy.\n\nFRANK\n(to the baby)\nHiya, Oscar. What do you say, slugger?\n\nFRANK\n(to Dana)\nThat's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms.\nBarrett.\n\nDANA\n(finding her keys)\nThank you, Frank. Oh, are you ever going to\nfix the radiator in my bedroom? I asked you\nlast week.\n\nFRANK\nDidn't I do it?\n\nBABY BUGGY\n\nIt starts to vibrate as if shaken by an unseen hand.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY\nHe GURGLES with delight at the movement.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - DANA AND FRANK - DAY\n\nNeither of them notice the movement of the carriage.\n\nDANA\nNo, you didn't, Frank.\n\nFRANK\nOkay, that's no problem.\n\nDANA\nThat's exactly what you said last week.\n\nBUGGY WHEELS\n\nThe brakes unlock themselves.\n\nDANA\n\nShe reaches for the handlebar of the buggy, but the buggy rolls forward\njust out of her reach and stops. Surprised by the movement, she reaches\nfor the handlebar again, but this time the buggy rolls away even\nfurther. Alarmed now, Dana hurries after it, but the buggy keeps\nrolling down the street at ever increasing speed.\n\nSIDEWALK\n\nDana chases the buggy down the street, shouting to passing pedestrians\nfor help, but every time someone reaches out to stop it, the buggy\nswerves and continues unchecked.\n\nINTERSECTION\n\nCars, trucks, and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races\ntoward the corner.\n\nDANA\n\nShe puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY\n\nA city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy.\n\nBUGGY\n\nIt careens toward the corner.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY\n\nIts eyes are wide open with excitement.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY\n\nBus and buggy are closing fast as the buggy bounces over the curb and\ninto the crosswalk.\n\nBUS\n\nThe bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter the\nintersection at high speed.\n\nBUGGY\n\nIt comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street. The bus\ncontinues missing the buggy by inches.\n\nINTERSECTION\n\nCars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as Dana runs into the\nintersection and snatches up the baby. She hugs it close, deeply\nrelieved, then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the\nsupernatural has re-entered her life.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. UPPER WEST SIDE - NEW YORK CITY STREET - GHOSTBUSTERS LOGO - DAY\n\nTHEME MUSIC kicks in strongly as we see the familiar \"No Ghosts\" symbol\nand PULL BACK to reveal that it's painted on the side of Ecto-1, the\nGhostbusters' emergency vehicle, which is speeding up Broadway on the\nUpper West Side. RAY STANTZ is driving and WINSTON ZEDDEMORE is riding\nshotgun.\n\nEXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)\n\nThe Ectomobile pulls up in front of a carefully-restored brownstone.\nStantz and Winston, wearing their official Ghostbuster uniforms, jump\nout of the old ambulance, shoulder their proton packs and enter the\nhouse.\n\nINT. BROWNSTONE - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nA WOMAN greets them and leads them through the expensively-furnished\nhouse.\n\nSTANTZ\n(all business)\nHow many of them are there, ma'am?\n\nWOMAN\nFourteen. They're in the back. I hope you can\nhandle them. It's been like a nightmare.\n\nWINSTON\nHow big are they?\n\nShe holds her hand out indicating about four feet.\n\nWINSTON\n(resolute)\nWe'll do our best, ma'am.\n\nWOMAN\nThey're right out here.\n\nShe leads them to a set of French doors that open into another room.\nStantz and Winston pause to make final adjustments to their equipment.\n\nSTANTZ\nReady?\n\nWINSTON\nI'm ready.\n\nSTANTZ\nThen let's do it.\n\nHe pushes through the French doors and they step into the room.\n\nINT. BROWNSTONE - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nThey are immediately attacked by fourteen or fifteen screaming KIDS\nbetween the ages of seven and ten.\n\nKIDS\n(disappointed)\nGhostbusters!! Boooo!!\n\nTables are set with party favors, ice cream and birthday cake and the\nroom is strewn with discarded toys and games. A couple of weary parents\nsink onto lawn chairs as Stantz and Winston take over the party.\n\nWINSTON\n(trying his best)\nHow you doin', kids?\n\nLITTLE BOY\n(nasty)\nI though we were having He-Man.\n\nSTANTZ\nHe-Man couldn't make it today. That's why\nwe're here.\n\nBOY\nMy dad says you're full of crap.\n\nSTANTZ\n(stopped cold)\nWell, a lot of people have trouble believing\nin the paranormal.\n\nBOY\nNo, he just says you're full of crap and that's\nwhy you went out of business.\n\nHe kicks Stantz in the leg. Stantz grabs him by the shirtfront.\n\nSTANTZ\n(low and menacing)\nI'm watching you.\n(to Winston)\nSong.\n\nWinston switches on a tiny TAPE RECORDER which starts PLAYING the\nGhostbusters THEME SONG. Stantz and WInston start singing\n\nSTANTZ AND WINSTON\n'There's something wrong in the neighborhood.\nWho you gonna call?'\n\nKIDS\n(all together)\nHe-Man!!\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. WEST 77TH STREET - DAY (LATER)\n\nStantz and Winston wearily load their equipment into the Ectomobile.\n\nWINSTON\nThat's it, Ray. I've had it. No more parties.\nI'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged\nnine-year-olds.\n\nSTANTZ\nCome on, Winston. We can't quit now. The\nholidays are coming up. It's our best season.\n\nThey get in the car\n\nINT. ECTO-1 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nStantz tries to start the car, but the engine won't turn over.\n\nWINSTON\nGive it up, Ray. You're living in the past.\nGhostbusters doesn't exist anymore. In a year\nthese kids won't even remember who we are.\n\nSTANTZ\n(tries to start the car again)\nUngrateful little Yuppie larvae. After all we\ndid for this city.\n\nWINSTON\nYeah, what did we do, Ray? The last real job\nwe had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow\nman and blew the top three floors off an uptown\nhighrise.\n\nSTANTZ\nYeah, but what a ride. You can't make a\nhamburger without chopping up a cow.\n\nHe turns the key again, the ENGING TURNS OVER, then starts GRINDING and\nCLUNKING disastrously, chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted bits\nof metal onto the pavement. Finally, with a BLAST of black sooty\nexhaust from the tailpipe, Ecto-1 shudders and dies. Frustrated, Stantz\nbangs his head lightly on the steering wheel\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. WKRR-TV STUDIO RECEPTION AREA - DAY (LATER)\n\nA bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on WKRR,\nChannel 10 in New York. We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title\ncard and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC, and\nwe return to the show in progress: \"World of the Psychic with Dr. Peter\nVenkman.\" There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and\nsitting there is our host PETER VENKMAN, the renowned and somewhat\ninfamous ex-Ghostbuster.\n\nVENKMAN\n\nHe turns TO CAMERA and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging tone,\nunderstated and intimate.\n\nVENKMAN\nHi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,'\nI'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest,\nauthor, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton\nAnglund.\n(to his guest)\nMilt, your new book is called The End of the\nWorld. Isn't that kind of like writing about\ngum disease. Yes, it could happen, but do you\nthink anybody wants to read a book about it?\n\nMILTON\nWell, I think it's important for people to know\nthat the world is in danger.\n\nVENKMAN\nOkay, so can you tell us when it's going to\nhappen or do we have to buy the book?\n\nMILTON\nI predict that the world will end at the\nstroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.\n\nVENKMAN\nThis year? That's cutting it a little close,\nisn't it? I mean, just from a sales point of\nview, the book just came out, right? So you're\nnot even looking at the paperback release for\nmaybe a year. And it's going to be at least\nanother year after that if the thing has\nmovie-of-the-week or mini-series potential.\nYou would have been better off predicting 1992\nor even '94 just to be safe.\n\nMILTON\n(irritated)\nThis is not just some money-making scheme! I\ndidn't just make up the date. I have a strong\npsychic belief that the world will end on New\nYear's Eve.\n\nVENKMAN\n(placating)\nWell, for your sake, I hope you're right. But\nI think my other guest may disagree with you.\nElaine, you had another date in mind?\n\nThe CAMERA REVEALS ELAINE, an attractive, aggressive New Jersey\nhousewife, sitting on the other side of Venkman.\n\nELAINE\nAccording to my sources, the world will end\non February 14, in the year 2016.\n\nVENKMAN\nValentine's Day. That's got to be a bummer.\nWhere did you get that date, Elaine?\n\nELAINE\nI received this information from an alien. I\nwas at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having\na drink in the bar when he approached me and\nstarted talking. Then he must have used some\nsort of ray or a mind control device because\nhe made me follow him to his room and that's\nwhere he told me about the end of the world.\n\nVENKMAN\nYour alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?\n\nELAINE\nIt may have been a room on the spacecraft made\nup to look like a room in the Holiday Inn. I\ncan't be sure, Peter.\n\nVENKMAN\n(humoring her)\nNo, you can't, and I think that's the whole\nproblem with aliens; you just can't trust them.\nYou may get some nice ones occasionally like\nStarman or E.T., but most of them turn out to\nbe some kind of lizard. Anyway, we're just\nabout out of time.\n(does his wrap-up right TO\nthe CAMERA)\nNext week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless\npets.\n(holds up a hairless cat)\nUntil then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...\n(puts a finger to his temple\nand sends out a though to his\nviewers)\n... Good night.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. TV STUDIO - CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER)\n\nVenkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer, NORMAN, a\nwell-meaning young incompetent.\n\nVENKMAN\nWhere do you find these people? I thought\nwe were having the telekinetic guy who bends\nthe spoons?\n\nNORMAN\nA lot of the better psychics won't come on the\nshow. They think you're too skeptical.\n\nVENKMAN\nSkeptical! Norman, I'm a pushover. I think\nprofessional wrestling is real.\n\nThere is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come\nout of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Norman)\nWhat's all this?\n\nNORMAN\nThey just interviewed the mayor on 'Cityline.'\n\nVENKMAN\nThe Mayor! He's a friend of mine.\n\nVenkman starts down the hall as the MAYOR and his principal aide, JACK\nHARDEMEYER, come walking out of the studio.\n\nVENKMAN\n(calling to the Mayor)\nLenny!\n\nThe Mayor sees Venkman, blanches and hurries off, pretending not to know\nhim.\n\nVENKMAN\n(starts to follow him)\nLenny! It's Pete Venkman!\n\nThe plainclothesmen cut Venkman off and Hardemeyer puts a heavy hand\nagainst Venkman's chest.\n\nHARDEMEYER\n(snide)\nCan I help you?\n\nVENKMAN\n(dangerous)\nYeah, you can get your hand off my chest.\n\nHardemeyer smiles and drops his hand.\n\nHARDEMEYER\nI'm Jack Hardemeyer. I'm the mayor's assistant.\nWhat can I do for you?\n\nVENKMAN\nI'm an old friend of the mayor's. I just\nwant to say hello to him.\n\nHARDEMEYER\n(scornful)\nI know who you are, Doctor Venkman. Busting\nany ghosts lately?\n\nVENKMAN\nNo, that's what I want to talk to the mayor\nabout. We did a little job for the city a\nwhile back and we ended up getting sued,\nscrewed and tattooed by deskworms like you.\n\nHARDEMEYER\n(bristling)\nLook, you stay away from the mayor. Next fall,\nbarring a disaster, he's going to be elected\ngovernor of this state and the last thing we\nneed is for him to be associated with two-bit\nfrauds and publicity hounds like you and your\nfriends. You read me?\n\nHardemeyer walks off with the two cops.\n\nVENKMAN\nOkay, I get it. But I want you to tell Lenny\nthat, because of you, I'm not voting for him.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY\n\nThe broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and\nvisitors. Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artist's tackle box and\nenters the museum.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATER)\n\nWe are FULL-FRAME ON a larger-than-life, full-figure portrait of VIGO\nTHE CARPATHIAN, a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an\nincredibly powerful evil presence. Then we PULL BACK to reveal the\nstudio, which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum, lit\nby large skylights in the ceiling. Working on the Vigo painting is\nJANOSZ POHA, a youngish art historian and painter, the head of the\ndepartment, quirky, intense and somewhat creepy. Janosz is staring\nlongingly across the room at Dana.\n\nDANA\n\nShe is carefully cleaning a 19th Century landscape painting, still\npreoccupied by the extraordinary near-accident with the buggy. Janosz\nwatches her for a moment, then comes up behind her and looks over her\nshoulder.\n\nJANOSZ\n(with an East European accent)\nStill working on the Turner?\n\nDana jumps, startled by the intrusion.\n\nDANA\nOh, yes, I got in a little late this morning,\nJanosz.\n\nJANOSZ\nYou know, you are really doing very good work\nhere. I think soon you may be ready to assist\nme in some of the more important restorations.\n\nDANA\nThank you, Janosz. I've learned a lot here,\nbut now that my baby's a little older, I was\nhoping to rejoin the orchestra.\n\nVIGO PAINTING\n\nAt the mention of Dana's baby, the figure of Vigo miraculously turns his\n\nhead and looks at Dana.\n\nJANOSZ AND DANA\n\nNeither of them notice the movement in the painting.\n\nJANOSZ\n(disappointed)\nWe'll be very sorry to lose you. Perhaps I\ncould take you to lunch today?\n\nDANA\nActually, I'm not eating lunch today. I have\nan appointment.\n(looks at her watch)\nIn fact, I'd better go.\n\nShe starts gathering up her things.\n\nJANOSZ\nEvery day I ask you, and every day you've got\nsomething else to do. Do I have bad breath\nor something?\n\nDANA\n(trying to brush him off)\nI'm sorry. Perhaps some other time.\n\nJANOSZ\nOkay, I'll take a raincheck on that.\n\nJanosz smiles at her as she exits, then goes back to his easel.\n\nJANOSZ\n(to himself)\nI think she likes me.\n\nHe switches on an English language TAPE and starts practicing the\nphrases as he resumes working.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. UNIVERSITY - DAY\n\nDana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building. A sign\nidentifies it as \"The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research.\"\n\nINT. UNIVERSITY - DAY (A LITTLE LATER)\n\nDana is explaining the buggy incident to EGON SPENGLER, the soberly\nintellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster, as he conducts an\nexperiment assisted by a research team of graduate students, all of whom\nare Japanese, Chinese, or Korean. The device he is testing is a black\nbox about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic\ndisplays.\n\nDANA\n... and then the buggy just suddenly stopped\ndead in the middle of the street\n\nSPENGLER\n\nDid anyone else see this happen?\n\nDANA\nHundreds of people. Believe me, I didn't\nimagine this.\n\nSPENGLER\nI'm not saying you did. In science we always\nlook for the simplest explanation.\n\nAn ASSISTANT interrupts.\n\nASSISTANT\nWe're ready, Dr. Spengler\n\nSPENGLER\n(to the Assistant)\nWe'll start with the negative calibration.\n\nHe picks up the device and prepares to test it.\n\nDANA\n(curious)\nWhat are you working on, Egon?\n\nSPENGLER\nI'm trying to determine whether human\nemotional states have a measurable effect on\nthe psychomagnetheric energy field. It's a\ntheory Ray and I were working on when we had\nto dissolve Ghostbusters.\n\nAn assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window, actually\na two-way mirror, that looks into a small waiting room. Inside the\nwaiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a heated\narguement.\n\nSPENGLER\n(to Dana)\nThey think they're here for marriage\ncounseling. We've kept them waiting for two\nhours and we've been gradually increasing the\ntemperature in the room.\n(checking a heat sensor)\nIt's up to 95 degrees at the moment. Now my\nassistant is going to enter and ask them if\nthey'd mind waiting another half-hour.\n\nAs Spengler, Dana, and the research team watch, the assistant enters the\nwaiting room and tells the couple about the new delay. They explode\nwith anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them\nthrough the glass. After recording his readings, he returns to his\nAssistant.\n\nSPENGLER\nWe'll do the happiness index next.\n(to Dana)\nI'd like to bring Ray in on your case, if\nit's all right with you.\n\nDANA\nOkay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.\n\nSPENGLER\nOh no.\n\nDANA\n(affectedly casual)\nDo you ever see him?\n\nSPENGLER\nOccasionally\n\nDANA\nHow is he these days?\n\nSPENGLER\nVenkman? I think he was borderline for a\nwhile there. Then he crossed the border.\n\nDANA\nDoes he ever mention me?\n\nSPENGLER\nNo. Not that I can recall.\n\nThey move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a lovely\nlittle girl playing with a wonderful array of toys.\n\nDANA\n(slightly disappointed)\nWell, we didn't part on very good terms and\nwe sort of lost track of each other when I\ngot married.\n\nThe Assistant interrupts again.\n\nASSISTANT\nWe're ready for the affection test.\n\nSPENGLER\n(to the assistant)\nGood. Send in the puppy.\n\nDANA\n(continuing)\nI thought of calling him after my marriage\nended, but --. Anyway, I appreciate you're\ndoing this, Egon\n\nThey watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable\nCocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl. Spengler monitors\nher as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog.\n\nDANA\n(handing him a card)\nThis is my address and telephone number.\nWill you call me?\n\nSPENGLER\nCertainly.\n\nDANA\nEgon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of\nthis to Peter if you don't mind.\n\nSPENGLER\nI won't.\n\nDANA\nThank you.\n\nShe shakes his hand and exits.\n\nSPENGLER\n(to his assistant)\nNow let's see how she reacts when we take\naway the puppy\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOK STORE - DAY (LATER)\n\nIt's a small basement shop located on a quaint commercial block in\nGreenwich Village. The window is crowded with occult artifacts and old\nbooks full of arcane metaphysical lore. The TELEPHONE RINGS.\n\nSTANTZ\n(v.o., answering the phone)\nRay's Occult.\n\nINT. RAY'S OCCULT BOOKS - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe shelves are jammed floor to ceiling with books on the paranormal.\nRay sits on a barstool behind the counter wearing an old cardigan\nsweater over a T-shirt. He has on a pair of reading glasses and chews\non a battered, reeking pipe. As he talks on the phone he prepares a cup\nof herb tea for Spengler who is thumbing through an arcane text.\n\nSTANTZ\n(on the phone)\nYeah ... mmhmm ... What do you need? ... What\nhave I got? I've got alchemy, astrology,\napparitions, Bundu Magic Men, demon\nintercession, U.F.O. abductions, psychic\nsurgery, stigmata, modern miracles, pixie\nsightings, golden geese, geists, ghosts, I've\ngot it all -- what are you looking for? ...\nDon't have any. Try the stockyards.\n\nHe hangs up.\n\nSPENGLER\nWho was that?\n\nSTANTZ\nSome crank. Looking for goat hooves. Come\nup with anything?\n\nSPENGLER\n(referring to the book)\nThis one's interesting. Berlin, 1939, a\nflower cart took off by itself and rolled\napproximately half a kilometer over level\nground. Three hundred eyewitnesses.\n\nSTANTZ\nYou might want to check those Duke University\nmean averaging studies on controlled\npsychokinesis.\n\nSPENGLER\n(going to the stacks)\nGood idea.\n\nThe bones hanging over the door rattle as Venkman enters the shop.\n\nVENKMAN\nOh, hello, perhaps you could help me. I'm\nlooking for an aerosol love potion I could\nspray on a certain Penthouse Pet that would\nmake her unconditionally submit to an unusual\npersonal request.\n\nSTANTZ\nOh, hiya, Pete.\n\nVENKMAN\nSo, no goat hooves, huh?\n\nSTANTZ\n(strung)\nI knew that voice sounded familiar. What's\nup? How's it going?\n\nVENKMAN\nNowhere -- fast. Why don't you lock up and\nbuy me a sub?\n\nSTANTZ\n(slightly evasive)\nUh, I can't. I'm kind of working on something.\n\nSpengler steps out of the stacks.\n\nVENKMAN\nEgon!\n\nSPENGLER\nHello, Venkman.\n\nVENKMAN\nHow've you been? How's teaching? I bet\nthose science chicks really dig that big\ncranium of yours, huh?\n\nSPENGLER\nI think they're more interested in my\nepididymis.\n\nVENKMAN\nI don't even want to know where that is.\n\nVenkman steps behind the counter and takes a beer from Ray's mini-fridge.\n\nSTANTZ\nOh, your book came in, Venkman. Magical\nPaths to Fortune and Power.\n\nHe hands Venkman the book.\n\nVENKMAN\nGreat.\n(reading the contents)\nSo what are you guys working on?\n\nSTANTZ\nOh, just checking something for an old friend.\n\nVENKMAN\nWho?\n\nSTANTZ\n(at a loss)\nWho? Just -- someone we know.\n\nVENKMAN\nOh, Ray --\n\nHe grabs Stantz by both ears and pulls up.\n\nVENKMAN\nWho? Who? Who?\n\nSTANTZ\nAaah! Nobody! I can't tell you!\n\nVENKMAN\nWho, Ray?\n\nSTANTZ\n(giving in)\nDana! Dana Barrett!\n\nVenkman lets go of his ears and smiles. Spengler looks at Stantz and shakes his head.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. DANA'S APARTMENT - DAY (LATER)\n\nThe apartment is old and creatively furnished with a comfortable mix of\nmodern and traditional pieces. Maria, a young Hispanic woman who does\nday care for Dana, is feeding the baby in the kitchen when the DOORBELL\nRINGS.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nDana enters from the bedroom and crosses to the front door. She opens\nit and admits Ray and Egon.\n\nDANA\n(hugging Ray)\nHi, Ray. It's good to see you. Thanks for\ncoming.\n\nSTANTZ\nNo problem. Always glad to help -- and hug.\n\nDANA\n(to Spengler)\nHi, Egon.\n\nShe shakes his hand and is about to close the door when Venkman appears\nin the doorway.\n\nVENKMAN\nHi, Dana.\n\nDana is caught completely off guard by Venkman's surprise appearance.\n\nVENKMAN\nI knew you'd come crawling back to me.\n\nShe regards him coolly, as always amused and amazed at his\npresumptuousness.\n\nDANA\nHello, Peter.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Dana)\nYou know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you\ndidn't call me first. I'm still into all\nthis stuff, you know. Haven't you ever seen\nmy show?\n\nDANA\nI have. That's why I didn't call you first.\n\nVENKMAN\nI can see that you're still very bitter about\nus, but in the interest of science, I'm going\nto give it my best shot. Let's go to work,\nboys.\n\nStantz and Spengler begin a comprehensive parapsychological work-up on\nthe baby and the immediate physical environment.\n\nVENKMAN AND DANA\n\nVenkman starts nosing around the apartment. Dana follows him.\n\nVENKMAN\nSo what happened to Mr. Right? I hear he\nditched you and the kid and moved to Europe.\n\nDANA\nHe didn't \"ditch\" me. We had some problems,\nhe got a good offer from an orchestra in\nEngland and he took it.\n\nVENKMAN\nHe ditched you. You should've married me,\nyou know.\n\nDANA\nYou never asked me, and every time I brought\nit up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.\n\nVENKMAN\nMen are very sensitive, you know. We need to\nfeel loved and desired, too.\n\nDANA\nWell, when you started introducing me as \"the\nold ball and chain,\" that's when I left.\n\nVENKMAN\nI may have a few personal problems but one thing\nI am is a total professional.\n\nHe leaves her and crosses to Spengler.\n\nSPENGLER\n\nHe's taking a complete set of body and head measurements of the baby\nwith a tape measure and calipers.\n\nVENKMAN\nWhat are you going to do, Egon? Knit him a\nsnowsuit?\n\nSpengler ignores the remark and hands Venkman a specimen jar.\n\nSPENGLER\nI'd like to have a stool specimen\n\nVENKMAN\nYeah, you would. Is that for personal or\nprofessional reasons?\n\nVENKMAN\n(picking up the baby)\nOkay, kid. Up you go.\n\nHe starts clowning with the baby, holding him over his head and pressing\nhis nose into the baby's belly, pretending that the baby is attacking\nhim.\n\nVENKMAN\nHelp! Please somebody help me! Get him off!\nQuickly! He's gone completely berserk!\n\nDana is amused and somewhat disarmed by Venkman's rapport with the baby.\n\nDANA\nWhat do you think?\n\nVENKMAN\nThere's no doubt about it. He's got his\nfather's looks. The kid is ugly -- extremely\nugly. And smelly.\n(resumes playing with the baby)\nYou stink! It's just horrible. You are the\nstinkiest baby I ever smelled.\n(to Dana)\nWhat's his name?\n\nDANA\nHis name is Oscar.\n\nVENKMAN\nOscar! You poor kid!\n\nDANA\n(losing patience)\nPeter, this is serious. I need to know if you\nthink there's anything unusual about him.\n\nVENKMAN\nUnusual?\n(holds up the baby and\nscrutinizes him)\nI don't know. I haven't had a lot of\nexperience with babies.\n\nHe looks at the baby, pulling his feet up, trying to get the sleeper\noff.\n\nDANA\n(taking the specimen jar)\nI'll do it.\n\nVENKMAN\nI'll supervise.\n\nINT.

If anything\nwas going on it's totally subdued now.\n\nSpengler enters.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Spengler)\nWhat now, Brainiac?\n\nSPENGLER\nI think we should see if we can find\nanything abnormal on the street.\n\nVENKMAN\nFinding something abnormal on the street\nshouldn't be too hard.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT.

And the dry\ncleaners we used to go to. And the old\nvideo store.\n(he wipes away an imaginary\ntear)\nWe really had some good times, didn't we?\n\nDANA\nWe definitely had a moment or two.\n\nDana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street.\n\nDANA\nThat's where the buggy stopped.\n\nVENKMAN\nOkay, let's take a look.\n\nVenkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely\noblivious to the CARS HONKING and whizzing past him and starts motioning\nlike a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill. Then he signals\nfor Dana, Stantz and Spengler to join him in the middle of the street.\n\nSTANTZ\n(reading the PKE meter)\nIs this the spot?\n\nDANA\nA little to the left. Right there! That's\nwhere it stopped.\n\nStantz reads the PKE meter.\n\nSTANTZ\nNothing. Not a trace.\n\nSPENGLER\nWhy don't we try the Giga-meter?\n\nVENKMAN\nWhat's that?\n\nSTANTZ\nEgon and I have been working on a gauge to\nmeasure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs -\ngiga electron volts.\n\nSPENGLER\nThat's a thousand million electron volts.\n\nVENKMAN\nI knew that.\n\nSpengler switches on the Giga-meter, the device he was testing in the\nlab, and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped.\nThe indicator goes right into the red zone and the DEVICE starts CLICKING\nWILDLY.\n\nSTANTZ\nI think we hit the honeypot, boys. There's\nsomething brewing under the street.\n\nDANA\n(worried, to Venkman)\nPeter, do you think maybe I have some genetic\nproblem or something that makes me vulnerable\nto these supernatural things.\n\nVENKMAN\nYou mean like the time you got possessed and\nturned into a monster terror dog? No, not\na chance. Total coincidence.\n(to Stantz and Spengler)\nAm I right?\n\nStantz and Spengler look at him skeptically, not convinced by the\ncoincidence theory.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT.

Are you nuts?\nIf anybody found out about this we'd be in\nserious trouble. The judge couldn't have\nbeen clearer - no ghostbusting.\n\nVENKMAN\nRelax. We're going to keep this whole thing\nnice and quiet, low key, no profile.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nSpengler, wearing a hardhat, is JACKHAMMERING a hole in the middle of the\nstreet. Safety cones and reflectors have been set up and a small area is\nlit by strong work lights.\n\nPOLICE CAR\n\nIt turns onto East 77th Street, cruises slowly up to the makeshift\nworksite and stops. The noise of the JACKHAMMER is so loud, Spengler\ndoesn't notice the police car and the two COPS inside looking at them.\nFinally, he looks up, sees the police car and freezes.\n\nFIRST COP\nHow ya doing?\n\nSPENGLER\n(reeking with guilt)\nFine! It's cutting fine now.\n\nFIRST COP\n(curious)\nWhy are you cutting?\n\nSPENGLER\n(looking for one of the\nothers)\nWhy are we cutting? Uh - boss!\n\nVenkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats, doing a\ngood imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman.\n\nFIRST COP\nWhat are you doing here?\n\nVENKMAN\n(belligerent)\nWhat the hell's it look like we're doing?\nWe're bustin out asses over here cause\nsome douchebag downtown ain't got nothin'\nbetter to do than make idiots like us work\nlate on a Friday night, right?\n(looks to Spengler for\nagreement)\n\nSPENGLER\n(with a \"right on\" fist)\nYo.\n\nThe cops seem satisfied by the explanation.\n\nFIRST COP\nOkay, boys, take it easy.\n\nThey drive off. Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts\nrubbing his sore shoulders.\n\nSPENGLER\nYou were supposed to help me with this.\n\nVENKMAN\nYou need the exercise.\n\nStantz resumes JACKHAMMERING, while Venkman and Spengler clear the\nrubble from the hole. Suddenly he hits metal. They clear away\ngenerations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover.\nThe manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters NYPRR.\n\nSTANTZ\n(examing it)\nNYPRR. What the hell -- ? Help me lift\nthis.\n\nThey prey off the iron cover with crowbars, uncovering a very dark and\nvery deep abyss.\n\nSTANTZ\n(shining a flashlight into\nthe hole)\nWow! It's an old airshaft. It just goes\nforever.\n\nSpengler leans in with the giga-meter which is reading even higher now.\n\nSPENGLER\nVery intense. We need a deeper reading.\nSomebody has to go down there.\n\nVenkman and Spengler both look at Ray.\n\nSTANTZ\nThanks, boys.\n\nThey snap Stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a strong\ncable attached to a winch. Ray calls out orders to them as he descends\ndeeper and deeper.\n\nSTANTZ (O.S.)\n(his voice echoing in the\nairshaft)\nKeep going -- more -- more --\n\nINT.

A finely inlaid sign identifies it as VAN HORNE\nSTATION.\n\nSTANTZ\n\nHe pans the walls with his flashlight, admiring the excellent tilework,\nand speaks quietly to Venkman and Spengler over his walkie-talkie.\n\nSTANTZ\n(reverently)\nThis is it, boys, the end of the line. Van\nHorne Station. The old New York Pneumatic.\nIt's still here.\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nVenkman has no idea what he's talking about.\n\nSPENGLER\n(explaining)\nThe New York Pneumatic Railway. It was an\nexperimental subway system. Fan-forced\nair-trains, built around 1870.\n\nSTANTZ\n(over the walkie-talkie)\nThis is about as deep as you can go under\nManhattan without digging your own hole.\n\nSPENGLER\n(to Stantz)\nWhat's the reading?\n\nINT. VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nStantz shines his flashlight on the meter and whistles at the extremely\nhigh reading.\n\nSTANTZ\n(on the radio)\nOff the top of the scale. This place is\nreally hot. Lower me to the floor.\n\nAs Venkman and Spengler feed him some more cable, he pans his flashlight\ndown the wall of the station, then onto the floor.\n\nSTANTZ\n(shouts)\nHold it!! Stop!! Whoa!!\n\nINT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ'S POV - FLOOR - NIGHT\n\nBelow him is a river of bubbling seething, glowing slime, a veritable\ntorrent of disgusting ooze.\n\nAs he stares into the foul effluent, we become aware of the strangely\namplified and magnified sounds of great ENGINES THROBBING and pulsing in\nthe bowels of the city, of WATER RUSHING through pipes, STEAM HISSING\nthrough ducts, the muffled RUMBLE of the SUBWAY and the ROAR of TRAFFIC,\nand mixed with it all, the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and pain\n-- VOICES SHOUTING in anger, SCREAMING in fear, GROANING in pain, a sad\nand eerie symphony.\n\nINT. VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ - NIGHT\n\nSTANTZ\n(ranting on the radio)\nOh, my God! It's a seething, bubbling,\npsychic cess! Interlocked tubes of plasm,\ncrackling with negative GEVs! It's glowing\nand moving! It's -- it's a river of slime!!\n\nSTANTZ\n\nHe dangles from the end of the cable, holding his feet up as high as he\ncan. He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger on\nit, shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the end.\nReaching down, he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts retracting\nthe pole.\n\nSLIME\n\nSuddenly, a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out of\nthe slime and snatches at Stantz's dangling feet. He jerks his legs up\nas several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him.\n\nSTANTZ\n(on the radio)\nHaul me up, Venkman! Now!\n\nEXT. EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nVenkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed Supervisor's\ncar drives up, and behind it, the same police car they saw earlier. A\nburly SUPERVISOR gets out and crosses toward them, followed by the two\ncops.\n\nSUPERVISOR\n(no nonsense)\nOkay, what's the story here?\n\nVenkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the\nbelligerent worker ploy again, only this time he's wearing a Nynex\nhardhat.\n\nVENKMAN\nWhat, I got time for this? We got three\nthousand phones out in the Village and about\neight million miles of cable to check.\n\nSUPERVISOR\n(not buying it)\nThe phone lines are over there.\n(points to the curb)\n\nVenkman pops Spengler on the head.\n\nVENKMAN\nI told ya!\n\nStantz can be heard ranting over Venkman's walkie-talkie.\n\nSTANTZ (O.S.)\n(filtered)\nHelp! Help! Pull me up! It's alive! It's\neating my boots.\n\nVenkman switches off the walkie-talkie.\n\nFIRST COP\nYou ain't with Con Ed or the phone company.\nWe checked. Tell me another one.\n\nVenkman stares at the Cop for a long moment.\n\nVENKMAN\nGas leak?\n\nINT.

Then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on for\ninformation about the blackout. She listens to a special news report\nfor a moment, then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby.\nShe crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the door\nand looks in. Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS, scaring her half to death.\nLeaving the chain on the door, she opens it a crack and sees Janosz\nstanding in the hall, eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of\nthe hallway. He looks slightly dazed and even creepier.\n\nDANA\n(surprised)\nJanosz?\n\nJANOSZ\nHello, Dana. I happened to be in the\nneighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to\nsee if everything's all right with you --\nyou know, with the blackout and everything?\nAre you okay?

She is frightened but conceals it\nfrom him.\n\nDANA\n(mechanically and cautiously)\nWe're fine, Janosz.\n\nHe tires to look around her into the apartment.\n\nJANOSZ\nDo you need anything? You want me to come\nin?\n\nDANA\nNo, everything's fine. Honestly. Thanks\nanyway.\n\nJANOSZ\nOkay, just thought I'd check. Good night,\nDana. Sleep well.

The law does not recognize\nthe existence of ghosts, and I don't believe\nin them either, so I don't want to hear a\nlot of malarkey about goblins and spooks and\ndemons. We're going to stick to the facts\nin this case and save the ghost stories for\nthe kiddies.

Louis is desperately paging\nthrough a mountain of legal textbooks.\n\nLOUIS\n(nervous)\nI think you're making a big mistake here,\nfellas. I do mostly tax law and some probate\nstuff occasionally. I got my law degree at\nnight school.\n\nSTANTZ\nThat's all right. We got arrested at night.\n\nSPECTATORS' GALLERY\n\nVenkman is talking to Dana at the wooden rail in front of the gallery.\n\nDANA\nI wish I could stay.

Why were\nyou digging the hole? And please remember\nthat you're under oath.\n\nVENKMAN\nI had my fingers crossed when they swore me\nin, but I'm going to tell you the truth.\nThere are things in this world that go way\nbeyond human understanding, things that\ncan't be explained and that most people don't\nwant to know about anyway. That's where we\ncome in.\n\nPROSECUTOR\nSo what are you saying? That the world of\nthe supernatural is your special province?\n\nVENKMAN\nNo, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens\nand somebody has to deal with it.\n\nThe spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order.\n\nWIPE TO:\n\nINT.

That's all you have to say?\n\nLOUIS\nDid I forget something?\n\nHe searches through a disorderly pile of notes.\n\nJUDGE\nThat was unquestionably the worst\npresentation of a case I've ever heard in a\ncourt of law! I ought to cite you for\ncontempt and have you disbarred. As for\nyour clients, Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz\nand Egon Spengler, on the charges of\nconspiracy, fraud and the willful destruction\nof public property, I find you guilty on all\ncounts. I order you to pay fines in the\namount of $25,000 each and I sentence you to\neighteen months in the city correctional\nfacility at Ryker's Island.\n\nSTANTZ\n\nHe sees the activity in the jar\n\nSTANTZ\nUh-oh, she's twitchin'.\n\nTHE BENCH\n\nThe Judge continues\n\nJUDGE\nAnd on a more personal note, let me go on\nrecord as saying that there is no place in\ndecent society for fakes, charlatans and\ntricksters like you who prey on the\ngullibility of innocent people. You're\nbeneath the contempt of this court. And\nbelieve me, if my hands were not tied by the\nunalterable fetters of the law, a law which\nhas become in my view far too permissive and\ninadequate in it's standards of punishment,\nI would invoke the tradition of our\nillustrious forebearers, reach back to a\nsterner, purer justice and have you burned\nat the stake!\n\nHe hammers the bench with his gravel as the gallery erupts noisily.

The Scoleri Brothers!\n\nSCOLERI BROTHERS\n\nBig in life, even bigger in death, the ghostly Scoleri brothers seem ten\nfeet tall. They are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads are\nmetal electrocution caps with live, sparking electrical wires still\nattached. Twenty-five hundred volts of electricity shoot through their\nbodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints, trying to\nget at the Judge.\n\nJUDGE\n\nHolding his gavel like a pitiful weapon, he crawls over to the defense\ntable where Venkman, Stantz and Spengler are now crouched, assessing the\nspectral intruders.\n\nJUDGE\n(terrified)\nYou've got to do something!\n\nVENKMAN\nWho are they?\n\nJUDGE\nThey're the Scoleri Brothers. I tried them\nfor murder. They were electrocuted up at\nOssining in '48. Now they want to kill me.\n\nVENKMAN\nMaybe they just want to appeal.\n\nSCOLERI BROTHERS\n\nThey break loose from the electric chairs, then turn toward the defense\ntable and BLAST it with HIGH-VOLTAGE FINGER-LIGHTNING.\n\nPROSECUTOR\n\nShe sprints for the door, pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers.\n\nGHOSTBUSTERS\n\nThey jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box, pulling the Judge\nwith them.\n\nVENKMAN\nThese boys aren't playing around.\n\nJUDGE\n(desperately)\nYou've got to stop them. Please!\n\nLOUIS\n(thinking like a lawyer)\nViolating a judicial restraining order could\nexpose my clients to serious criminal\npenalties. As their attorney I'd have to\nadvise them against it.\n\nSCOLERI BROTHERS\n\nThey start punching through the jury box.\n\nJUDGE\n\nHe is just about hysterical with fear.\n\nJUDGE\nAll right! All right! I'm recinding the\norder. Case dismissed!!\n(he pounds his gavel on\nthe floor)\nNow do something!\n\nSTANTZ\nLet's go to work, boys.\n\nWith that, the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and dash\nacross the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs were\nbeing displayed as evidence. They strap them on hastily as the Brothers\ncontinue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge.\n\nVENKMAN\n(slinging the pack onto\nhis back)\nGeez, I forgot how heavy these things are.\n\nSTANTZ\n(grabbing other gear)\nOkay, let's heat 'em up!\n\nThey flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle\nthrowers.\n\nSTANTZ\nAll right, throwers. Set for full neutronas\non stream.\n\nThey switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms.\n\nSCOLERI BROTHERS\n\nThey are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts\nthem.\n\nVENKMAN\nHey! Why don't you pick on someone your own\nsize?\n\nThe towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms, ready to shoot\nlightning at their new adversaries.\n\nSTANTZ\n(to the others)\nOn my signal, boys. Open 'em up -- Now!\n\nThey all pull their triggers and the wands EXPLODE with incredible\npowerful STREAMS OF ENERGY, doing even more damage to the courtroom.\n\nVENKMAN\nSpengs, take the door. Ray, let's try and\nwork them down and into the corner.\n\nWorking as a team, they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with the\nstreams, forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out on\nthe floor.\n\nSTANTZ\nWatch it! I'm coming under you, Pete.\n\nThey circle around the two ghosts, prodding them with the streams while\nducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers. Finally, Ray\nsees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids of\nlight energy.\n\nSTANTZ\nSteady -- watch your streams -- easy now --\nVenky, bring him left -- Spengy, pull him\ndown -- trapping -- trapping -- now!\n\nHe stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into the\ntraps which snap shut.\n\nINT.

BEDROOM SET (TV COMMERCIAL - FULL SCREEN VIDEO) - NIGHT\n\nA man and his wife are lying in bed reading. The man is played by Louis\nTully and JANINE MELNITZ, the Ghostbusters' once and future receptionist,\nis playing his wife. They are both terrible actors. Suddenly, a ghost,\nactually a very bad puppet on a wire, floats through the bedroom. Janine\nsees it and screams.\n\nLOUIS\nWhat is it, honey?\n\nJANINE\nIt's that darn ghost again!

But coming from you,\nI can't honestly say I'm surprised.\n\nDANA\nI must be losing my mind.

Let\nme show you around.\n(he crosses to the kitchen area)\nThis is the cuisine de maison --\n\nIt's an incredible mess. The sink is piled high with dirty dishes and the\ncounters are littered with all sorts of food trash. He grabs a big open\nHefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it.\n\nVENKMAN\n(looking at the sink)\nWe may have to wash some of these if you get\nhungry --\n(he looks in the fridge)\n-- but there's no food anyway so forget\nabout it. I have all kinds of carry-out\nmenus if you feel like ordering.\n\nHe opens a drawer full of pizza, barbecue and Chinese food menus, then\ncrosses to the bathroom.\n\nVENKMAN\nBathroom's right here -- let me just tidy\nup a few things.\n\nDANA\nPeter, this is very nice, but you don't have\nto do any of this, you know.\n\nHe goes into the bathroom and we hear WATER RUNNING, the TOILET FLUSHING\nand more items going into the Hefty bag.\n\nVENKMAN (O.S.)\nThe shower works but it's a little tricky.\nThey're both marked \"Hot.\" It takes a little\npractice, but at least this one won't try\nand eat you.\n\nHe comes out of the bathroom with the now-loaded Hefty bag over his\nshoulder.\n\nVENKMAN\nBe careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter.\nBut the bed's good and I just changed the\nsheets so if you get tired, feel free. In\nfact, I think you should definitely plan on\nspending the night here.\n\nDANA\nReally? And how would we handle the sleeping\narrangements?\n\nVENKMAN\nFor me it's best if I sleep on my side and\nyou spoon up right behind me with your arms\naround me. If we go the other way I'm\nafraid your hair will be getting in my face\nall night.\n\nDANA\nHow about you on the sofa and me in bed with\nthe baby.\n\nVENKMAN\nOr we could do that.\n\nDANA\nThank you.\n(she picks up Oscar)\nPoor baby. I think I should put him down\nnow.\n\nVENKMAN\nI'll put him down for you.\n(taking the baby)\nYou are way too short! And your belly-button\nsticks out! You're nothing but a burden to\nyour poor mother!\n\nVenkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving Dana in the living\nroom, feeling more relaxed and a lot safer.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MUSEUM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)\n\nVenkman is waiting in front of the building as ECTO-2 pulls up and\nStantz, Spengler and Winston get out and report on Dana's apartment.\n\nVENKMAN\nDid you find anything at Dana's?\n\nSTANTZ\nNothing. Just some mood-slime residue in\nand around the bathtub. But we did turn up\nsome interesting stuff on this Vigo character\nyou mentioned. I found the name Vigo the\nCarpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians,\nMartyrs and Madmen. Listen to this:\n\nSPENGLER\n(reads from xerox of entry)\n\"Vigo the Carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --\"\n\nVENKMAN\nA hundred and five years? He really hung\non, didn't he.\n\nSTANTZ\nAnd he didn't die of old age either. He was\npoisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched,\ndisemboweled, drawn and quartered.\n\nWINSTON\nI guess he wasn't too popular at the end\nthere.\n\nSPENGLER\nNo, not exactly a man of the people.\n(reads)\n\"Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the\nTorturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the\nUnholy.\"\n\nSTANTZ\nThis guy was a bad monkey. He dabbled in\nall the Black Arts, and listen to this\nprophecy. Just before his head died, his\nlast words were, \"Death is but a door, time\nis but a window. I'll be back.\"\n\nVENKMAN\nThat's it? \"I'll be back?\"\n\nSPENGLER\nIt's a rough translation from the Moldavian.\n\nThey enter the museum carrying their monitoring equipment.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - SECURITY DESK - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nRudy the guard looks up in surprise as the Ghostbusters enter.\n\nRUDY\nHey, Dr. Venkman. What's going on?\n\nVENKMAN\nWe're just going up to Restorations for a\nminute.\n\nRUDY\nOh, I can't let you do that. Mr. Poha told\nme not to let you up there anymore.\n\nVENKMAN\n(with mock seriousness)\nOkay, we were trying to keep this quiet but\nI think you can be trusted. Tell him, Ray.\n\nSTANTZ\n(very official)\nMister, you have an Ecto-paritic,\nsubfusionary flux in this building.\n\nRUDY\nWe got a flux?\n\nWINSTON\nYou got a flux and a half.\n\nSTANTZ\nNow if you don't want to be the --\n(he counts)\n-- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock\nfrom a planar rift, I suggest you get down\nbehind that desk and don't move until we\ngive you the signal \"Stabilize -- All Clear.\"\n\nRudy gulps and starts to hunker down behind the desk as the Ghostbusters\nhead upstairs.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)\n\nJanosz is working on the Vigo painting when the Ghostbusters enter. He\nrushes over and stops them at the door.\n\nJANOSZ\nDr. Venkman? Dana is not here.\n\nVENKMAN\nI know.\n\nJANOSZ\nThen why have you come?\n\nVENKMAN\nWe got a major creep alert and we're just\ngoing down the list. Your name was first.\n\nSTANTZ\n(to Spengler and Winston)\nLet's sweep it, boys.\n\nThey deploy and start scanning the studio with their monitoring devices.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Janosz)\nYou know, I never got to ask you. Where you\nfrom, Johnny?\n\nJANOSZ\n(nervous)\nThe Upper West Side.\n\nSPENGLER\n(consulting his PKE meter)\nThis entire room is extremely hot, Peter.\n\nJANOSZ\nWhat exactly are you looking for, Dr. Venkman?\n\nVENKMAN\nWe'll know when we find it. You just sit\ntight. This won't take long.\n\nSTANTZ\n\nUsing the Giga-meter, he traces a strong psychomagnetheric reading to\nthe painting of Vigo in the alcove at the end of the studio. Venkman\ncomes up behind him with Janosz right on his heels.\n\nVENKMAN\nThis is the one that looked at Dana.\n\nJANOSZ\nIt must be the chemical fumes in the studio.\nPeople start imagining things --\n\nVENKMAN\n(interrupts)\nI'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing\ntheory. If she says it looked at her, it\nlooked at her.\n(to Vigo)\nHey, you! Vigie! Look at me. I'm talking\nto you. Hey! Look at me when I'm talking\nto you.\n\nThey watch the painting for any sign of movement.\n\nVIGO\n\nHis eyes stare lifelessly into the distance.\n\nSTANTZ AND VENKMAN\n\nVenkman starts shooting Polaroids of Vigo.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Vigo)\nBeautiful, beautiful. Work with me, baby.\nJust have fun with it.\n(to Stantz)\nOkay, he's playing it cool. Let's finish\nup and get out of here.\n\nSTANTZ\nI'll get one more reading.\n\nVenkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting. Stantz scans\nthe painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigo's.\n\nVIGO\n\nHis eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantz's soul.\n\nSTANTZ\n\nHe stands there transfixed, unable to look away, as a strange and subtle\ntransformation occurs within him. Winston comes up behind him and breaks\nthe spell.\n\nWINSTON\n(looking at the painting)\nNow that's one ugly dude.\n\nSTANTZ\n(coming back to his senses)\nHuh? What?\n\nWINSTON\nYou finished here?\n\nSTANTZ\n(distracted)\nWhat? Yeah.\n\nWINSTON\nAre you all right? You coming down with\nsomething?\n\nSTANTZ\nNo, I'm fine. I just got light-headed for\na second there. Let's go.\n\nThey head for the door.\n\nJANOSZ\n\nHe escorts the Ghostbusters to the door.\n\nJANOSZ\nSo you see, everything is in order, is it\nnot?\n\nVENKMAN\nNot. Don't leave town and report any change\nin your address to the proper authorities.\nWe'll be back.\n\nThey exit.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. MUSEUM - DAY (LATER)\n\nThe Ghostbusters cross to ECTO-2.\n\nSPENGLER\nThere's definitely something going on in\nthat studio. The PKE levels were max-plus\nand the Giga-meter was showing all red.\n\nWINSTON\nI'd put my money on that Vigo character.\n\nVENKMAN\nYeah, that's a safe bet.\n(to Stantz)\nYou and Spengman see what else you can dig\nup on Vigo and this little weasel Poha.\nThose two were made for each other.\n\nINT. ECTO-2 - DAY (LATER)\n\nThe Ghostbusters are driving back to the firehouse. Stantz is at the\nwheel. His eyes are vacant, he seems distracted and very tense. Stantz\nswerves suddenly and HONKS the horn angrily.\n\nSTANTZ\n(to another driver)\nIdiot!\n(honking)\nMove it, you jerk!\n\nVenkman and Winston exchange surprised looks.\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nStantz drives extremely fast, HONKING vindictively, weaving dangerously\nthrough traffic.\n\nINT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nWinston looks at Ray, concerned.\n\nWINSTON\nGoing a little fast, aren't we, Ray?\n\nStantz turns on him.\n\nSTANTZ\n(viciously)\nAre you telling me how to drive?\n\nWINSTON\nNo, I just thought --\n\nSTANTZ\nWell don't think!\n\nHe HONKS again and tromps hard on the accelerator.\n\nEXT. STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS)\n\nEcto-2 is now barreling down the avenue. Pedestrians leap to safety as\nStantz runs a red light.\n\nINT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nThey hang on to the safety straps as Stantz continues his maniacal ride.\n\nWINSTON\n(to Stantz, really worried\nnow)\nAre you crazy, man? You're going to kill\nsomebody!\n\nStantz looks at him and smile demonically.\n\nSTANTZ\nNo, I'm going to kill everybody!\n\nHe swerves off the road.\n\nEXT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nThe car heads right for a big tree.\n\nINT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nAt the last possible moment, Winston cold-cocks Stantz, grabs the wheel\nand steps across to stomp on the brakes.\n\nEXT. ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION)\n\nThe car skids into the tree and stops. The Ghostbusters stumble out\ndazed and shaken, but unhurt. Stantz rubs his eyes and looks at the\nothers, completely at a loss.\n\nSTANTZ\n(himself again)\nWhat happened?\n\nVENKMAN\nYou just picked up three penalty points on\nyour driver's license.\n\nWINSTON\nAre you all right?\n\nSTANTZ\nYeah, I guess so. It was the strangest\nthing. I knew what I was doing but I\ncouldn't stop. This really terrible feeling\ncame over me and -- I don't know -- I just\nfelt like driving into that tree and ending\nit all. Whew! Sorry, boys.\n\nThey inspect the damage to the car.\n\nVENKMAN\n(confidentially, to\nSpengler)\nWatch him, Egon. Don't even let him shave.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - DAY (LATER)\n\nThere's a KNOCK at the front door, a key turns in the lock, and Venkman\nenters somewhat tentatively holding a bouquet of flowers and a small\nsuitcase of Dana's.\n\nVENKMAN\n(calls out)\nI'm home!\n\nHe looks around the large open loft.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to himself)\nI knew it. She cleaned.\n\nHe hears the SHOWER RUNNING and crosses to the bathroom. The door is\nhalf-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred) through\nthe transparent vinyl curtain. He closes the bathroom door and looks at\nthe baby asleep on the bed, surrounded by pillows to prevent him rolling\noff. Then he turns and bumps into Dana who's just coming out of the\nbathroom wrapped in a towel. She jumps back into the bathroom.\n\nShe comes out again, this time wearing a robe.\n\nVENKMAN\nAre you all squeaky clean now?\n\nDANA\n(humoring him)\nYes, I'm very clean. Did they find anything\nat my apartment?\n\nShe squeezes past him into the bedroom and closes the door.\n\nVENKMAN\n(through the door)\nNothing. They stayed there all night, went\nthrough your personal stuff, made a bunch of\nlong-distance phone calls and cleaned out\nyour refrigerator. And didn't find anything.\n\nDana opens the bedroom door.\n\nDANA\nThey didn't find anything? In the bathtub\n... the pink ooze ... nothing? So, what do\nI do now?\n\nVENKMAN\nNow you get dressed and we go out. I got a\nbabysitter and everything. Trust me, you\nneed it.\n\nDANA\nI'm not here to date. I can't leave Oscar\nin a strange place with someone I don't know.\n\nVENKMAN\nIt's Janine Melnitz, from my staff. She's\none of my most valuable employees.\n\nDANA\nDoes she know anything about babies?\n\nVENKMAN\nJanine Melnitz, are you kidding?\n(handing her the flowers)\nDo I have a vase? I brought some of your\nclothes. Wear something intriguing. I\nbrought along some interesting possibilities.\n\nDANA\nOkay, but it's not a date. It's a dinner.\n\nShe smiles and closes the door again. He opens the closet and starts\nlooking for his good suit.\n\nVENKMAN\nDid you happen to see some shirts on the\nfloor in here?\n\nDANA (O.S.)\nI put them in your hamper. I thought they\nwere dirty.\n\nVENKMAN\n(shaking his head)\nI have a hamper? Next time ask me first,\nokay. I have more than two grades of\nlaundry. There're lots of subtle levels\nbetween clean and dirty.\n\nHe pulls some clothes out of the hamper and inspects them.\n\nVENKMAN\nThese aren't so bad yet. You just hang them\nup for a while and they're fine.\n\nCUT TO:\nINT. FIREHOUSE - RECEPTION AREA - EARLY EVENING\n\nJanine covers her computer terminal and starts turning out the lights.\nThen she notices that the lights are still on upstairs. She starts\nprimping and freshening up her makeup.\n\nINT. FIREHOUSE - LAB AREA - SAME TIME\n\nLouis is strapping on a proton pack, preparing to deal with Slimer once\nand for all. He's wearing a bicyclist's rearview mirror on a headband.\n\nLOUIS\n(to himself)\nOkay, Stinky, this is it. Showdown time.\nYou and me, pal. You think you're smarter\nthan I am? We'll see about that.\n(loud)\nOh, hello, Pizza Man! Oh, two larges! I\nonly ordered one. Oh, pepperoni and\npineapple. My absolute favorite. I guess\nI'll have to eat these both by myself.\n\nTHE CEILING\n\nSlimer pokes his head through the ceiling and scans the room hanging\nupside down.\n\nLOUIS\n\nHe spots Slimer through the rearview mirror.\n\nLOUIS\n(quietly)\nOkay, let's boogie!\n\nHe whirls around and fires a proton stream at Slimer, slicing a burning a\ngash across the ceiling.\n\nTHE STAIRS\n\nJanine comes up and ducks as a bolt of energy streaks across the room and\nstrikes the wall behind her. Slimer disappears.\n\nLOUIS\n(embarrassed and apologetic)\nOh migod! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do\nthat. It was an accident.\n\nJANINE\nWhat are you doing up here?\n\nLOUIS\nI was trying to get that smelly green thing.\nThe guys asked me to help out. I'm like the\nfifth Ghostbuster.\n\nJANINE\nWhy would you want to be a Ghostbuster if\nyou're already an accountant?\n\nLOUIS\nOh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls\nin sick or gets hurt.\n\nLouis quickly slips off the proton pack and sets it down.\n\nJANINE\nHave you made any plans yet? You know\ntomorrow is New Year's Eve.\n\nLOUIS\nNo, I celebrate at the beginning of my\ncorporate tax year which is March first.\nThat way I beat the crowds.\n\nJANINE\nThat's very practical. I hate going out on\nNew Year's Eve, too.\n\nThere is an awkward silence between them and Janine starts to leave.\n\nJANINE\nWell, good night, Louis.\n\nLOUIS\n(on an impulse)\nJanine, do you feel like maybe getting\nsomething to eat on the way home?\n\nJANINE\nI'd like to, but I told Dr. Venkman I'd\nbabysit.\n(seductively)\nDo you want to babysit with me?\n\nLOUIS\nOh, sure, that sounds great.\n\nThey exit.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - NIGHT (LATER)\n\nThere is a KNOCK at the door and Venkman goes to answer it. He's dressed\nfor the evening and looking very dapper.\n\nINT. VENKMAN'S LOFT - ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION\n\nVenkman opens the door and finds Stantz, Spengler and Winston standing\nthere wearing over-the-hip rubberized waders, firemen's slickers, and\nminers' helmets, carrying tons of sensing devices, meters, collection\njars and photographic equipment. They look like they're rigged out for a\nmajor spelunking expedition.\n\nVENKMAN\n(ushering them in)\nDon't tell me, let me guess. All-you-can-eat\nbarbecue rib night at the Sizzler?\n\nSTANTZ\nWe're going down into the sewer system to\nsee if we can trace the source of the\npsycho-reactive slime flow. We thought you\nmight want to come along.\n\nVENKMAN\nDarn it! I wish I'd known you were going.\nI'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.\n\nSPENGLER\nYou know, animals and lower life forms often\nanticipate major disasters. Given the new\nmagnetheric readings we could see a tremendous\nbreeding surge in the cockroach population.\n\nVENKMAN\nRoach breeding? Sounds better and better.\n(calls out)\nDana? The boys are going down under the\nsewers tonight to look for slime. Egon\nthinks there might even be some kind of big\nroach-breeding surge. Should we forget about\ndinner and go with them instead?\n\nDana steps into the living room looking very beautiful.\n\nSTANTZ\nWow.\n\nDana looks curiously at their outfits.\n\nDANA\nHi.\n\nThey nod and wave back.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Ray and Egon)\nI think we're going to have to pass on the\nsewer trip, boys. Let me know what you find\nout.\n\nSTANTZ\n(on his exit)\nOkay, but you're missing all the fun.\n\nINT. VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (LATER)\n\nStantz, Spengler and Winston come down the stairs into the station,\nguided by a very old map of the underground city.\n\nSTANTZ\nThis is it. Van Horne Station. Right where\nthe old transit map said it would be.\n\nThey cross to the edge of the platform and look into the river of slime.\n\nSTANTZ\nLet's get a sounding on the depth of that\nflow.\n\nStantz has a long, coiled, graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end of\nit attached to his utility belt.\n\nSTANTZ\nStand back.\n\nHe takes the cord in his hand, swings the plumb bob over his head and\ncasts it out into the middle of the flow. The plumb bob sinks and\nSpengler reads the depth.\n\nSPENGLER\nSix feet -- seven -- eight --\n\nSTANTZ\nThat's it. It's on the bottom.\n\nSPENGLER\nNine feet -- ten --\n\nWINSTON\nIs the line sinking?\n\nSPENGLER\nNo, the slime is rising.\n\nStantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the\nplatform and around his boots.\n\nSTANTZ\n(alarmed)\nLet's get out of here, boys.\n\nHe starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck.\n\nSpengler tries to help, but whatever is pulling on the cord is stronger\nthan all three of them. As their unseen adversary pulls them closer and\ncloser to the edge, Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from his\nbelt but finally just unhooks the whole belt. Spengler lets go in time\nbut Winston doesn't. He is jerked off his feet and into the slime flow.\nStantz and Spengler look at each other, summon their courage and jump in\nafter him.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. ARMAND RESTAURANT - NIGHT (LATER)\n\nDana and Venkman are sitting at a table in an elegant restaurant nibbling\ncaviar and toasting with very expensive champagne.\n\nVENKMAN\n(very intimate)\nHere's to -- us.\n\nShe sighs and drinks.\n\nVENKMAN\nSo -- are you making any New Year's\nresolutions?\n\nDANA\nI want to stop getting involved with men who\naren't good for me.\n\nVENKMAN\nDoes that start exactly at midnight tomorrow,\nor could you hold off for a few days maybe?\n\nDANA\nFor one night in your life, do you think\nit's possible for us to be completely real?\n\nVENKMAN\nAll right, you want to be real? So tell me\nwhy did you dump me?\n\nDANA\nOh, Peter, I didn't dump you. I just had\nto protect myself. You really weren't very\ngood for me, you know.\n\nVENKMAN\nI'm not even good for me.\n\nDANA\nWhy do you say things like that? You're so\nmuch better than you know.\n\nVENKMAN\nThank you. If I had that kind of support\non a daily basis, I could definitely shape\nup by the turn of the century.\n\nDANA\n(already feeling the\neffects of the champagne)\nSo why don't you give me a jingle in the\nyear 2000?\n\nVENKMAN\nLet me jingle you right now.\n\nHe leans over to kiss her.\n\nDANA\nMaybe I should call Janine.\n\nVENKMAN\nDon't worry. Janine has a very special way\nwith children.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)\n\nJanine is on the sofa doing her nails while Louis paces with the baby.\n\nJANINE\n(looking around)\nI can't believe a person could actually live\nlike this.\n\nLOUIS\n(to the baby)\nSo these dwarfs had a limited partnership in\na small mining operation and then one day a\nbeautiful princess came to live with them.\n\nJANINE\nIt's really not a bad place. It just needs\na woman's touch.\n\nLOUIS\n(continuing)\nSo they bartered room and board in exchange\nfor housekeeping services, which was a good\ndeal for all of them because then they didn't\nhave to withhold tax and social security,\nwhich I'm not saying is right but it's just\na story, so I guess it's all right. I can\nfinish this later if you're tired.\n\nLouis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down.\n\nJANINE\nYou're really good with children, Louis. I\ncan tell.\n(as he returns)\nWhy don't you come here and sit with me?\n\nLOUIS\nOkay.\n\nHe sits stiffly beside her on the sofa.\n\nJANINE\n(getting close)\nMotherhood is a very natural instinct for\nme. I'd like to have a baby myself.\nWouldn't you?\n\nLOUIS\n(gulps)\nTonight?\n\nEXT. STREET - MANHOLE COVER - NIGHT (SAME TIME)\n\nA manhole cover is dislodged and pushed up from below. It slides away,\nand Winston crawls out of the manhole followed by Stantz and Spengler.\nThey are exhausted and covered with slime.\n\nWINSTON\n(uncharacteristically\nangry)\nNice going, Ray! What were you trying to\ndo -- drown me?\n\nSTANTZ\n(unusually mean)\nLook, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were\ntoo stupid to drop that line.\n\nWINSTON\n(shoves him)\nYou better watch your mouth, man, or I'll\npunch your lights out.\n\nSTANTZ\nOh yeah? Anytime, anytime. Just go ahead\nand try it.\n\nSpengler steps between them with unprecedented aggression.\n\nSPENGLER\nIf you two are looking for a fight, you got\none.\n(putting up his fists)\nWho wants it first? Come on, Ray. Try me,\nsucker.\n\nSTANTZ\n(squaring off)\nButt out, you pencil-necked geek. I've had\nit with you.\n\nThey grab each other and start to tussle. Suddenly Spengler comes to his\nsenses and pulls them apart.\n\nSPENGLER\n(forcefully)\nStrip! Right now! Get out of those clothes!\n\nHe starts yanking off his slicker and waders. Bewildered, Stantz and\nWinston start doing the same. Spengler helps pull off their clothes and\nthrows them into the open manhole. Now wearing only long underwear, they\nseem to return to normal.\n\nWINSTON\nWhat are we doing? Ray, I was ready to kill\nyou.\n\nSTANTZ\nDon't you see? It's the slime.

It's really kind of a coat and\ntie place.\n\nSTANTZ\nIt's all over the city, Pete -- well, under\nit actually.\n\nWINSTON\nRivers of the stuff!\n\nSPENGLER\nAnd it's all flowing toward the museum.\n\nHe gestures excitedly and a big gob of slime flies across the room and\nlands on a well-dressed diner.\n\nSTANTZ\n(calls out)\nSorry!\n\nDANA\nMaybe we should discuss this somewhere else.\n\nVenkman notes the look of alarm on Dana's face and pulls his colleagues\naside.\n\nVENKMAN\n(confidentially)\nBoys, listen. You're scaring the straights.\nLet's save this until tomorrow, okay?\n\nSPENGLER\n(to Venkman)\nThis won't wait until tomorrow, Venkman.\nIt's hot and it's ready to pop.\n\nMAITRE D'\n\nHe hurries through the restaurant with two city COPS right behind him and\nmakes straight for Venkman's table.\n\nMAITRE D'\nArrest these men.\n\nCOP\n(recognizing them)\nHey!

We have to see the mayor as\nsoon as possible.\n\nCOP\nLook, Doc, why don't you just go home.\nYou'll get a good night's sleep and then you\ncan give the mayor a call in the morning.\nCome on.\n\nHe takes Stantz by the arm but Stantz resists.\n\nSTANTZ\nWe're not going anywhere with you.

Now I\nfinally get here and we're taking her out\nfor a walk.\n\nSPENGLER\n(reading the Giga-meter)\nWe've got full power.\n\nStantz picks up a Nintendo control paddle from a home video game and\nstarts pushing the buttons.\n\nVENKMAN\n(into a microphone)\nOkay, Libby.

Soon it will be\nmidnight and the city will be mine -- and\nVigo's. Well, mainly Vigo's. But we have\na spectacular opportunity to make the best\nof our relationship.\n\nDANA\nWe don't have a relationship.\n\nJANOSZ\nI know. Marry me, Dana, and together we\nwill raise Vigo as our son. There are many\nperks that come with being the mother of a\nliving god. I'm sure he will supply for us\na magnificent apartment. And perhaps a car\nand free parking.\n\nDANA\nI hate and despise you and everything you\nstand for with all my heart and soul. I\ncould never forgive what you've done to me\nand my child.\n\nJANOSZ\nMany marriages begin with a certain amount\nof distance, but after a while I believe we\ncould learn to love each other.

FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT (LATER)\n\nThe avenue has been closed to traffic and barricades placed, blocking all\nthe side streets. A squadron of police motorcycles comes speeding around\nthe corner at 72nd Street and proceeds up Fifth Avenue in the direction\nof the museum.

As the light moves onto his\nface, Vigo spreads his arms wide and his upper body starts to emerge from\nthe canvas.\n\nVIGO\nSoon my life begins. Then woe to the weak,\nall power to me, the world is mine.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - JANOSZ - NIGHT\n\nThe baby's body begins to glow as Vigo reaches out for it. Then suddenly\na dark shadow falls across the skylight. Janosz looks up.\n\nINT.

Don't\nyou realize what you are dealing with? He's\nVigo! You are like the buzzing of flies to\nhim.\n\nVENKMAN\n(sighs)\nOh, Johnny. Did you back the wrong horse.\n\nWith that, the Ghostbusters fire their slime-blowers and hose Janosz from\nhead to toe, blowing him into the corner. Then they turn to Vigo.\n\nVIGO\n\nHe is now almost completely out of the painting, but still held from the\nknees down. He spits and rages at the Ghostbusters, trying to unleash\nhis magic powers.\n\nTHE GHOSTBUSTERS\n\nThey stand fast, secure in the knowledge that Vigo's power has been\nneutralized by the good will of the people.\n\nSTANTZ\nVigi, Vigi, Vigi -- you have been a bad\nlittle monkey.\n\nVENKMAN\nThe whole city's together on this one. We\ntook a vote. Everybody's down on you, you\nknow.\n\nWINSTON\n(arming his slime-blower)\nSay goodnight now.\n\nSuddenly Vigo grabs Stantz by the neck and holds him up as a shield.\n\nSPENGLER\nDon't shoot! You'll hit Ray!\n\nSTANTZ\n(strangling)\nDo it! Just do it!\n\nWinston fires and hoses both Vigo and Ray.\n\nVIGO\n\nHe bellows and drops Ray, then falls back into the painting.\n\nINT.

I've never felt better in my life.\n\nVENKMAN\nOh, no. We've got to live with this?\n\nThey pull him to his feet.\n\nSTANTZ\nI love you guys. You're the best friends\nI've ever had.\n\nHe hugs them each in turn, leaving them slimed as well. Venkman recoils\nin disgust.\n\nVENKMAN\nHey, I just had this suit cleaned.\n(indicating Janosz)\nTake care of the wiggler, will you.\n\nVenkman crosses to Dana who is snuggling the baby. She hugs Venkman.\n\nVENKMAN\nWhat is this -- a love in?\n(notes the symbols painted\non the baby's body)\nHey, sailor. I think the tattoos are a\nlittle much, don't you?\n\nHe picks up the baby.\n\nDANA\n(to Venkman)\nI think he likes you. I think I do too.\n\nVENKMAN\nFinally came to your senses, huh?\n\nThey hug and kiss.\n\nSPENGLER, WINSTON AND STANTZ\n\nThey help Janosz to his feet. He's dazed but unhurt.\n\nJANOSZ\n(restored to normalcy)\nWhat happened?\n\nSTANTZ\n(calmly)\nSir, you had a violent, prolonged,\ntransformative psychic episode. But it's\nover now. Want a coffee?\n\nJANOSZ\n(extremely nice)\nThat's very kind of you.\n\nSPENGLER\n(to Stantz)\nHe's fine, Ray. Physically intact,\npsychomagnetherically neutral.\n\nJANOSZ\nIs that good?\n\nWINSTON\nIt's where you want to be.\n\nAs they exit they stop to examine the painting that was concealed by\nVigo's self-portrait.\n\nSPENGLER\nLate Renaissance, I think. Caravaggio or\nBrunelleschi.\n\nWINSTON\n(staring at it)\nThere's something very familiar about this\npainting.\n\nINT. MUSEUM - NEW PAINTING - NIGHT\n\nIt's a beautiful painting in the high-Renaissance style depicting four\narchangels hovering protectively over a cherubic baby. One holds a harp,\none, an olive branch, the third, a book, and the last, a sword. Most\nremarkably, their faces bear an uncanny resemblance to Venkman, Stantz,\nSpengler and Winston.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT.

He waves his\nthanks to Slimer who is behind the wheel.\n\nLOUIS\n(to Slimer)\nOkay, so Monday night we'll get something\nto eat and maybe go bowling?

CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT (LATER)\n\nThe Statue of Liberty is sprawled inert on her back in the park behind\nthe museum, her toga up over her knees. The Mayor looks nearly suicidal.\nThe Ghostbusters stand beside him commiserating.\n\nVENKMAN\nShe's all right. She's just sleeping it off.\n\nMAYOR\n(stricken)\nWe just had it restored.\n\nVENKMAN\nThis probably isn't a good time to bring\nthis up, but the last time we did a job for\nthe city you stiffed us.\n\nSTANTZ\n(handing the Mayor an\ninvoice)\nThis is a bill for tonight's job.\n\nThe Mayor looks at it and gasps at the amount.\n\nMAYOR\nWhat! This is way too much.\n(hands the bill back to\nVenkman)\nWe won't pay.\n\nVenkman looks at the Statue.\n\nVENKMAN\n(to Stantz)\nI think she looks pretty good here, don't\nyou?\n\nSTANTZ\nYeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.\n\nRealizing he has no alternative, the Mayor sighs and takes the bill back.\n\nMAYOR\nAll right, all right.

I've been there. Good party town.\n\nSTANTZ\n(in a similarly reflective\nmood)\nMy great-grandparents were Swiss. I still\nhave the pictures they took of the statue\nfrom the boat when they arrived.\n\nVENKMAN\nOh, right, you told me that. They came to\nAmerica seeking other kinds of cheese, as I\nrecall. How about you, Winston?\n\nWINSTON\nMy people weren't taking any pictures from\nthose slave ships, man. And there wasn't\nany Statue in Charleston Harbor to welcome\nthem, either. What are you, Dana?\n\nVENKMAN\nMiss Blue Blood? Her family's been here\nsince the year 12.\n\nDANA\nThat's not true. It was 1620.\n\nVENKMAN\nSame difference.\n\nSTANTZ\nWhat's your story, Pete?\n\nVENKMAN\nMe? I'm a little of everything. Some Irish,\nsome German, some French, Dutch -- the women\nin my family slept around. And that's what\nmade this country great.\n\nDANA\nThat's a terrible thing to say.\n\nVENKMAN\nSo what? It's a free country.\n(looking up at the Statue)\nThanks, Lib.\n\nThey all look up at the Statue.\n\nEXT.

so much her words as such\nAs the way they were sung\nIt was the way they were sung\nDesiree\nOh, Desiree\nThere I was found\nBy the sweet passion sound\nOf your loving song\nTime was right, the night was long\n\nRemember, Desiree\nOh, Desiree\nSomehow I knew\nI could only have you 'til the morning light\nIf only for that single night\nSweet Desiree, you made it right\n\nThen came the fourth of June\nOn that sleepless night\nWell I tossed and I turned\nWhile the thought of her burned\nUp and down my mind\n\nFor she was there and gone\nWithout one regret\nBut she continues on\nLike the words of a song\nI could not forget, I could not forget\nYou might also likeDesiree\nOh, Desiree\nThere I was found\nBy the sweet passion sound\nOf your loving song\nTime was right, the night was long\n\nRemember Desiree\nOh, Desiree\nAnd though somehow I knew\nI could only have you 'til the morning light\nThe night was long, the time was right\n\nDo you remember, Desiree\nOh, Desiree\n\nDo you remember\nDesireeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1533757", "artist_names": "Wet Willie", "full_title": "Street Corner Serenade by\u00a0Wet\u00a0Willie",

day\nJust as all is born is new\nDo know what I say is true\nThat I'll be loving you always\n[Refrain]\nUntil the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)\nUntil the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)\nUntil the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)\nUntil we dream of life and life becomes a dream\n\n[Verse 2]\nDid you know that true love asks for nothing?\nHer acceptance is the way we pay\nDid you know that life has given love a guarantee\nTo last through forever and another day?\nJust as time knew to move on since the beginning\nAnd the seasons know exactly when to change\nJust as kindness knows no shame\nKnow through all your joy and pain\nThat I'll be loving you always\nAs today, I know I'm living, but tomorrow\nCould make me the past, but that, I mustn't fear\nFor I'll know deep in my mind\nThe love of me I've left behind\n'Cause I'll be loving you always\n\n[Refrain]\nUntil the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)\nUntil the trees and seas

Earhart's like \"oh, shit, got em!\"\nYou didn't know, but I was an immortal\nI just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal\nShuffled off my fucking mortal coil\nMortal Kombat, you know that

mind\nBut I'm not be-hind\nNo, I'm way out in the front\nRolling up a 30-foot blunt\nAnd you know I'm not gonna bunt\nIn a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger\nBecause I am the rap ringer\nI never

making no bids\nI heard they're not doing that door-knockin'\nBut, you know, we're not stoppin'\nHowever you appraise 'em\nNo, we are fuckin' raising\nOn the mic I'm fuckin' blazing\nIf the sun is blazing\nI turn into a raisin\nI'm bringing this whole craze\nFor almost two whole days\nI don't think that's possible\nI don't think that's wise\nI don't think that's probable\nThat is what they say when they look in to my eyes\nMy momma was afraid for me\nShe busted in like the ma\u00eetre d\nShe said \"Hello umm\"\nI don't think you wanna sit here\nI don't think you wanna get here\n'Cause you

If the clients get rich along the way, bully for them. Got a girlfriend?\n\nJORDAN Wife. She cuts hair.\n\nMark swallows a comment about that.

Nobody -- and I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Warren Buffet or Jimmy Buffet -- nobody knows if a stock\u2019s going up, down or fucking sideways, least of all stock brokers. But we have to pretend we know. Make sure you stay relaxed. Nobody wants to buy something from someone who sounds like they haven\u2019t gotten laid in a month. Take breaks when you feel stressed, jerk off if you can. You like jerking off, right?\n\nJORDAN Well... sure.\n\nMARK HANNA\nGood, jerking off is key. And I highly recommend cocaine, which will make you dial faster, which is good for me. Churn \u2018em and burn \u2018em, baby.\nThe Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages\t3/5/13\t11.\n\n\nA BUSBOY stops by with a fresh napkin for Mark who thanks him.

What if I took this bunch of nincompoops and molded them in my own image? I reinvented the company, gave it a new image, a new name. Something patrician, blue-blooded, something that reeked of tradition and anti-semitism.\n\nAnd as his Brokers settle in to folding chairs--\n\nJORDAN Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton\nOakmont. The clients we\u2019ve gone after in the past -- they\u2019re done. We will now target exclusively the wealthiest one percent of Americans. The methods we\u2019ve used -- over. Loud, obnoxious sales hype is worthless with these people.\nThe Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages\t3/5/13\t23.\n\nJORDAN (CONT'D)\nIn military terms it\u2019s like carpet-bombing -- noisy, menacing and only marginally effective. As Stratton brokers you will be laser-guided smart-bombs aimed at high-priority targets. You will establish an initial relationship with your clients selling only blue chip stocks -- then and only then will you attempt to sell the pink sheets, where the real money is. Now the key to every sale is this:\n\nJordan writes the word \u201cURGENCY\u201d on the board.\n\nJORDAN (CONT\u2019D)\nNo one buys stock unless he thinks it\u2019s going up and going up now. You must convince your client to buy before the takeover happens, before the lawsuit is settled, before the patent is granted.\nIf he says I\u2019ll think about it and call you back, it\u2019s over, you\u2019re dead!

And when that happens, which is any day now, what do you think will happen to the price of Kodak stock?\n\nCLIENT (O.S.) It\u2019ll go up?\n\nJORDAN\nExactly.

The fact is it doesn\u2019t matter what the fuck he says! If he\u2019s already agreed that the stock\u2019s going up, then the only real objection he has at this point is he doesn\u2019t trust you! And he shouldn\u2019t trust you, you\u2019re a fucking salesman! So what do you say?\nThe Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages\t3/5/13\t25.\n\n\n54\tINT.

Is this a great company or what?!!\n\nMore wild applause as Jordan signals across the bullpen to Donnie. We hear the opening strains of \u201cStars & Stripes Forever\u201d as he opens the door to a\n\nCOLLEGE MARCHING BAND\n\ndressed in underwear and hats. The music continues as somersaulting GYMNASTS and BATON-TWIRLERS bring up the rear.

Some have pets, which they tend to while they work -- iguanas, snakes, turtles, even a chimp. Others are getting shoulder rubs by Masseuses or being fitted for suits by a TAILOR. Over the above:\n\nJORDAN (V.O.)\nIf we hired \u2018em, they dropped out of college overnight and blew whatever allowance they had on a new suit from our in-house tailor.

Pretty soon someone figured out that if you resisted the urge to sleep for fifteen minutes, you got a pretty kick-ass high from it. Didn\u2019t take long for people to start abusing ludes, \u2018course, and in 1982 the U.S. Government Schedule One\u2019d them, along with the rest of the world. Which meant there was only a finite amount of these things left. No shit, you can\u2019t even find \u2018em anymore today.

Moments later, they step aboard.\n\nAGENT DENHAM Mr. Belfort, I\u2019m Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.\nThe Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages\t3/5/13\t74.\n\n\nJORDAN Heya! This is Nicole and,\num...Heidi. Girls, Patrick and...?\n\nAGENT DENHAM Agents Denham and Hughes. Your message said you wanted to speak privately.\n\nJORDAN It did. I do.\n(off Denham\u2019s stare) Oh, they\u2019re just friends.\n(to the girls) Give us a minute, okay?\n\nThe Hookers head below deck. Jordan shoots Denham a wink--check out that ass!\n\nJORDAN (CONT\u2019D) Can I get a glass? Got wine open or any kinda booze. Shrimp and lobster\u2019re over there if you\u2019re hungry.\n\nAGENT DENHAM\nBureau forbids us from drinking at sea.\n\nJordan surprised: the guy has a sense of humor.\n\nJORDAN\nI have something for you, I just gotta find it. Have a seat, will ya? Ever been on one of these before?\n\nAs Jordan rifles through some papers, Denham\u2019s eyes scan the deck, casually cataloguing everything.\n\nAGENT DENHAM\nA boat? Learned to sail when I was six.\n\nJORDAN\nI mean, one like this. Just had her extended to put a chopper on the back.\n\nJordan points out the Bell-Jet helicopter.\n\nAGENT DENHAM\nNever been on a boat with a second mode of transportation on top of it.\n\nJordan finds the file he\u2019s been looking for, offers it.\nThe Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages\t3/5/13\t75.\n\n\nAGENT DENHAM (CONT\u2019D) (before he\u2019ll accept)\nWhat is this?\n\nJORDAN\nNames and addresses of every guest at my wedding. Friends, clients. I even threw in the seating chart. Heard that\u2019s why you wanted the video, figured this\u2019d expedite whatever it is you\u2019re doing.\n(Denham looks: it\u2019s indeed a guest list from the wedding)\nI wanted to show you I\u2019ve got nothing to hide. I know you\u2019re investigating Stratton but for the life of me I can\u2019t figure out why. Sure, my company is unorthodox; what brokerage isn\u2019t? Maybe we\u2019re a little louder than most but we don\u2019t do anything illegal. Talk to the SEC, they\u2019ll tell you, they checked us out up and down.\n\nAGENT DENHAM The SEC\u2019s actually a civil regulatory agency. We pursue criminal activity.\n\nJORDAN\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. You guys take on real crime. Which is why I\u2019m so curious: what do you think we did?\n\nThe reason Jordan asked him here, Denham realizes.\n\nAGENT DENHAM I can\u2019t discuss ongoing investigations.\n\nJORDAN I understand.\n\nAGENT DENHAM Though, to be frank, this case kinda got dumped on my desk. Some higher-up felt your shop needed looking into after all that press, fell on me to do the looking.\n\nJORDAN\nYou know who you should be looking at? Goldman, Lehman Brothers, Merrill.\nThe Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages\t3/5/13\t76.\n\nJORDAN (CONT'D) What those guys\u2019re up to with collateralized debt obligations? This internet stock bullshit? C\u2019mon. If you want, I\u2019ll walk you through exactly --\n\nAGENT DENHAM\n-- that\u2019d be great. And if there\u2019s anything you can give me just to close out your file, get it off my desk--\n\nJORDAN\n-- sure, get you back to the real criminals --\n\nAGENT DENHAM\n-- then we could both profit from this little sit-down.\n\nJordan sizes him up: what did Denham mean by \u201cprofit\u201d?\n\nJORDAN\nYou sure you don\u2019t want anything to drink? Water for your pal?\n(Denham demurs)\nRumor is your started out in finance. Even got your broker\u2019s license before you joined the bureau.\n\nAGENT DENHAM Who told you that?\n\nJORDAN (searches his memory)\nJeez, who was it...? (comes up short)\nEver regret it? Giving up the money-crazed, pin-striped life? Ever think where you\u2019d be if you\u2019d stuck with it?\n\nAGENT DENHAM\nWhen I\u2019m riding the subway home, sweating my balls off, in a suit I\u2019ve worn three days, sure.\n\nJORDAN\nWhattaya pull in working at the bureau, if you don\u2019t mind me asking. 50-60K a year?\n\nAGENT DENHAM\nJust about. We get a free handgun out of it, though, that doesn\u2019t suck.\nThe Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages\t3/5/13\t77.\n\n\nJORDAN\nS\u2019crazy, the world we live in, the jobs with real value, the ones we should appreciate -- firefighters, teachers, FBI agents -- those are the ones we pay the least.\n\nAGENT DENHAM Way of the world.\n\nJORDAN\nThat\u2019s one thing I like about what I do, the opportunity to make that right. Take this kid we had interning last year. Didn\u2019t want to be a broker, wanted to be an environmental scientist or something, he had a student loan debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway, his mom gets sick, all they can afford is third-rate care. Some of us got together, made an investment on his behalf and --boom -- overnight everything changes, she\u2019s seeing the best doctors in the country. Sadly, didn\u2019t work out, she passed but still: having the power to do that makes all the other bullshit worth while.\n(as Denham considers that)\nSee, it\u2019s all about proper guidance, Pat. Knowing someone with the right relationships, who\u2019s discreet. I can change a life almost every day.\n\nThey measure each other.\n\nAGENT DENHAM\nHow much that intern make off your deal?\n\nJORDAN North of half a million.\n\nDenham summons Agent Hughes over. To Jordan:\n\nAGENT DENHAM\nCan you say that again, what you told me?\n(Jordan declines with a smile; to Agent Hughes)\nI believe Mr. Belfort just tried to bribe a federal officer.\nThe Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages\t3/5/13\t78.\n\n\nJORDAN\nWhat? I was making conversation.\n\nAGENT DENHAM Sounds like that to me, Jordan.\n\nJORDAN ...no, no, no...\n\nAGENT DENHAM ...sounded like that...\n\nJORDAN\n...no, to constitute a bribe, don\u2019t I have to make an explicit offer of money for services? With an exact dollar figure attached? All I said was \u201cnorth\u201d of half a million. According to the U.S. Criminal Code, that dog won\u2019t hunt, Pat.\n(then)\nHeard you were a straight arrow. That you wouldn\u2019t bend the rules other agents might. He was right.\n\nAGENT DENHAM\nYou did a background check on me?\n\nJORDAN\nFigured you were looking into me, was only fair. Plus you sail on a yacht fit for a Bond villain, sometimes you gotta act the part.\n\nAGENT DENHAM\nThis is why you invited me down to your yacht? With a couple hookers on it --\n\nJORDAN\n-- those are friends --\n\nAGENT DENHAM\n-- to get a sense of the guy who was coming after you?\n\nJordan puts his hands up: \u201cyou got me.\u201d\n\nJORDAN\nThanks for coming down. Now get off my boat.\n\nAGENT DENHAM\nYou know, most of the Wall Street jackasses I bust, they were born to the life.\nThe Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages\t3/5/13\t79.\n\nAGENT DENHAM (CONT'D) Their father was a douchebag\nbefore them, and his father before that. But you, you got this way all on your own. Good for you, Jordan.\n(as he starts to go) Thank you for having us. I\u2019m\nabsolutely certain we\u2019ll see each other again.\n(before he does)\nYou know, this is about the nicest boat I\u2019ve ever been on. Just think what a hero I\u2019ll be in the office when the bureau seizes it.\n\nJordan watches him go, temper flaring: he can\u2019t let Denham get the final word. He calls after them:\n\nJORDAN\nHey, Denham! I\u2019m gonna eat a claw of lobster now as I get my cock sucked by Heidi down below. You have a super ride home on the\nsubway thinking about that!\t*\n\nAs he watches them pull away, seething --\n\nJORDAN (V.O.)\nHe was a numbers guy, a follow-the-fucking-money\u2019er. He wasn\u2019t gonna come at me through my guys, looking for a weak link and a quick kill. He was gonna come at me like an accountant would, the way Ness got Capone, through my books. Which meant? It was ass-covering time.\n\n\n138\tINT. JORDAN\u2019S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (SUMMER \u201895)\t138\n\nAs Naomi looks on, 5 months pregnant, Jordan packs a suitcase.\n\n\nSwitzerland?

Rugrat set up a meeting with a Swiss Banker he knew from law school who could launder our money, but it wasn\u2019t till noon the next day.\n\nJordan glances at his watch, washes down a few ludes.\n\nJORDAN (V.O.)\nI knew if I timed my lude intake right, I\u2019d sleep through the entire overnight flight.\n\n\n140\tINT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (SUMMER \u201895)\t140\n\nJordan stands before the Bullpen talking to his Brokers.\n\nJORDAN (V.O.)\nAt four p.m. I popped a few ludes, which started kicking in by the time I finished our sales meeting.

DANCE CLUB - NIGHT (SUMMER \u201895)\t142\n\nOn the crowded dance floor, Jordan gets knocked around like a marionette, saliva strung from his mouth.\n\nJORDAN (V.O.)

HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT (SUMMER \u201895)\t143\n\nJordan is barely conscious as a Hooker rides him.\n\nJORDAN (V.O.) And by ten I didn\u2019t know who or what I was doing -- the amnesia\nphase.

Jordan\u2019s eyes flicker open. He yawns, looks around, tries to get up; he can\u2019t move. He looks down, sees six seat belts restraining his arms and legs. Jordan looks over at Donnie, mouth agape, asleep next to him.\n\n\nDonnie.\n\n\nNuuhh?\nJORDAN Donnie, wake up.\n\nDONNIE\n\nJORDAN\nUntie me, shitbag.

It\u2019s an impressive office, with\t* an enormous fish tank.\n\nDONNIE\nWe have a joke in America. \u201cHeaven is a place where the police are Brits, the chefs are Italian, the car mechanics are German, the prostitutes are French and the bankers are Swiss.\u201d I never got it \u2018til now -- look at those fucking fish! Come here, little guy...\n\nSAUREL\nYes, we have the same joke here. Only sometimes the English are chauffeurs and the chefs are French. The Germans, alas, are always mechanics; no one wants to grant them more authority than that.\n\nPolite laughter. Jordan, not as impressed by the fish, cuts straight to the point:\n\n\nJORDAN\nI'm curious about your bank secrecy laws.\n\nSAUREL\nExcusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom requires ten minutes of idle chit-chat before business can be discussed.\n(a smile)\nOf course, let\u2019s get \u201cdown to it.\u201d What would you like to know?\n\nJORDAN\nUnder what circumstances would you be obligated to cooperate with an FBI or U.S. Justice Department investigation?\n\n\nCa depend.\n\n\nCa depend?\nSAUREL\n\n\nJORDAN\nCa depend on what?\nThe Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages\t3/5/13\t84.\n\n\nSAUREL\nWhether America plans to invade Switzerland in the coming months.\n\nRUGRAT\nWant me to see if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croix?\n\nMore chuckles. Through Jordan\u2019s forced smile:\n\nJORDAN (V.O.) What I\u2019m asking, you Swiss dick, is are you going to fuck me over.\n\nSAUREL (V.O.) I understand perfectly, you American shitheel.\n\nSaurel smiles.\n\nSAUREL\nThe only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued also happened to be a crime in Switzerland. But there are very few Swiss laws pertaining to your \u201crumored\u201d improprieties. Which is why Mr. Azoff\u2019s joke is most appropriate: from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven, and we welcome you. If the U.S. Justice Department or FBI or SEC or IRS sent us a subpoena, it would become papier-toillette. We would wipe our ass with it.\n\nEveryone\u2019s impressed. Except Jordan.\n\nJORDAN\nUnless it was an investigation into stock fraud -- which is a crime in Switzerland. Then you\u2019d have to cooperate.\n\nSAUREL\n(now he\u2019s impressed) Yes, we would. Assuming the account is under your name.\nHowever, if it were in the name of a nominee of yours...\n\nThey take each other in.\nThe Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages\t3/5/13\t85.\n\n\nJORDAN (V.O.)\nWas that yodeling I just heard or did you just say what I thought you said?\n\nSAUREL (V.O.) Yes! Yes!\n\nAs the meeting wraps up with handshakes, Jordan\u2019s V.O. overwhelms Saurel\u2019s V.O..\n\nJORDAN (V.O.) He was telling me to use a\nrathole. Problem was: sneaking a U.S. rathole into Switzerland was a chance I couldn\u2019t take. What I needed was somebody with a European passport.\n\n\n152\tSCENES 152 - 153 OMITTED\t152\n\n\n154\tEXT.

Promise me\t* you\u2019ll spend at least ten thousand\npounds per month out of the account, okay?\n\nAUNT EMMA (chuckles)\nI wouldn't even know how. I really do have everything I need.\n\nJORDAN But I bet you don't have\neverything you want. How about a bigger apartment so your grandkids can sleep over?\n\nAunt Emma notices that Jordan is sweating, fidgety.

WE PUSH IN on Jordan.\n\nJORDAN (CONT\u2019D) See, the very idea of Stratton is that when you come here and step into this bullpen for the first time, you start your life anew. You have a place here and no one can take that away from you! Stratton Oakmont is America! Give me your tired and poor! The very moment you walk through that door and pledge your loyalty to this firm, you become part of a family, you become a Strattonite! It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, it doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re from!

He raises his hand for quiet.\n\nJORDAN (CONT\u2019D) In case any of you weren't aware of it, Kimmie was one of Stratton's first brokers, one of the original twenty. Now when most of you met Kimmie, you met her the way she is today -- a\nbeautiful woman who drives a brand new Mercedes, a woman who lives in the finest condo complex on Long Island. A woman who wears $3000 Armani suits, who spends her winters in the Bahamas and her summers in the Hamptons!\n\nWild applause.\n\nJORDAN (CONT\u2019D) But that\u2019s not the Kimmie I met. The Kimmie I met was broke, a single mom on the balls of her ass. Three months behind on her rent with an eight year old son! She came to me for a job and when I hired her she asked for a $5000 dollar advance so she could pay his tuition. And what did I do, Kimmie?\n\nKIMMIE\nYou wrote me a check for $25,000!\n\nJORDAN\nBecause I believed in you, like I believe in each and every one of you!\n\nKIMMIE I love you, Jordan!\n\nAs the Brokers go berserk, Jordan stands basking in the adoration.

LyricsLILY, the caretaker's daughter, was literally run off her feet. Hardly had she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office on the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat than the wheezy hall-door bell clanged again and she had to scamper along the bare hallway to let in another guest. It was well for her she had not to attend to the ladies also. But Miss Kate and Miss Julia had thought of that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a ladies' dressing-room. Miss Kate and Miss Julia were there, gossiping and laughing and fussing, walking after each other to the head of the stairs, peering down over the banisters and calling down to Lily to ask her who had come.\n\nIt was always a great affair, the Misses Morkan's annual dance. Everybody who knew them came to it, members of the family, old friends of the family, the members of Julia's choir, any of Kate's pupils that were grown up enough, and even some of Mary Jane's pupils too. Never once had it fallen flat. For years and years it had gone off in splendid style, as long as anyone could remember; ever since Kate and Julia, after the death of their brother Pat, had left the house in Stoney Batter and taken Mary Jane, their only niece, to live with them in the dark, gaunt house on Usher's Island, the upper part of which they had rented from Mr. Fulham, the corn-factor on the ground floor. That was a good thirty years ago if it was a day. Mary Jane, who was then a little girl in short clothes, was now the main prop of the household, for she had the organ in Haddington Road. She had been through the Academy and gave a pupils' concert every year in the upper room of the Antient Concert Rooms. Many of her pupils belonged to the better-class families on the Kingstown and Dalkey line. Old as they were, her aunts also did their share. Julia, though she was quite grey, was still the leading soprano in Adam and Eve's, and Kate, being too feeble to go about much, gave music lessons to beginners on the old square piano in the back room. Lily, the caretaker's daughter, did housemaid's work for them. Though their life was modest, they believed in eating well; the best of everything: diamond-bone sirloins, three-shilling tea and the best bottled stout. But Lily seldom made a mistake in the orders, so that she got on well with her three mistresses. They were fussy, that was all. But the only thing they would not stand was back answers.\n\nOf course, they had good reason to be fussy on such a night. And then it was long after ten o'clock and yet there was no sign of Gabriel and his wife. Besides they were dreadfully afraid that Freddy Malins might turn up screwed. They would not wish for worlds that any of Mary Jane's pupils should see him under the influence; and when he was like that it was sometimes very hard to manage him. Freddy Malins always came late, but they wondered what could be keeping Gabriel: and that was what brought them every two minutes to the banisters to ask Lily had Gabriel or Freddy come.\n\"O, Mr. Conroy,\" said Lily to Gabriel when she opened the door for him, \"Miss Kate and Miss Julia thought you were never coming. Good-night, Mrs. Conroy.\"\n\n\"I'll engage they did,\" said Gabriel, \"but they forget that my wife here takes three mortal hours to dress herself.\"\n\nHe stood on the mat, scraping the snow from his goloshes, while Lily led his wife to the foot of the stairs and called out:\n\"Miss Kate, here's Mrs. Conroy.\"\n\nKate and Julia came toddling down the dark stairs at once. Both of them kissed Gabriel's wife, said she must be perished alive, and asked was Gabriel with her.\n\n\"Here I am as right as the mail, Aunt Kate! Go on up. I'll follow,\" called out Gabriel from the dark.\n\nHe continued scraping his feet vigorously while the three women went upstairs, laughing, to the ladies' dressing-room. A light fringe of snow lay like a cape on the shoulders of his overcoat and like toecaps on the toes of his goloshes; and, as the buttons of his overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a cold, fragrant air from out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds.\n\n\"Is it snowing again, Mr. Conroy?\" asked Lily.\n\nShe had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat. Gabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and glanced at her. She was a slim, growing girl, pale in complexion and with hay-coloured hair. The gas in the pantry made her look still paler. Gabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on the lowest step nursing a rag doll.\n\n\"Yes, Lily,\" he answered, \"and I think we're in for a night of it.\"\n\nHe looked up at the pantry ceiling, which was shaking with the stamping and shuffling of feet on the floor above, listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding his overcoat carefully at the end of a shelf.\n\n\"Tell me, Lily,\" he said in a friendly tone, \"do you still go to school?\"\n\n\"O no, sir,\" she answered. \"I'm done schooling this year and more.\"\n\n\"O, then,\" said Gabriel gaily, \"I suppose we'll be going to your wedding one of these fine days with your young man, eh?\"\n\nThe girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and said with great bitterness:\n\n\"The men that is now is only all palaver and what they can get out of you.\"\nGabriel coloured, as if he felt he had made a mistake and, without looking at her, kicked off his goloshes and flicked actively with his muffler at his patent-leather shoes.\nHe was a stout, tallish young man. The high colour of his cheeks pushed upwards even to his forehead, where it scattered itself in a few formless patches of pale red; and on his hairless face there scintillated restlessly the polished lenses and the bright gilt rims of the glasses which screened his delicate and restless eyes. His glossy black hair was parted in the middle and brushed in a long curve behind his ears where it curled slightly beneath the groove left by his hat.\nWhen he had flicked lustre into his shoes he stood up and pulled his waistcoat down more tightly on his plump body. Then he took a coin rapidly from his pocket.\n\n\"O Lily,\" he said, thrusting it into her hands, \"it's Christmastime, isn't it? Just... here's a little....\"\n\nHe walked rapidly towards the door.\n\"O no, sir!\" cried the girl, following him. \"Really, sir, I wouldn't take it.\"\n\n\"Christmas-time! Christmas-time!\" said Gabriel, almost trotting to the stairs and waving his hand to her in deprecation.\n\nThe girl, seeing that he had gained the stairs, called out after him:\n\n\"Well, thank you, sir.\"\n\nHe waited outside the drawing-room door until the waltz should finish, listening to the skirts that swept against it and to the shuffling of feet. He was still discomposed by the girl's bitter and sudden retort. It had cast a gloom over him which he tried to dispel by arranging his cuffs and the bows of his tie. He then took from his waistcoat pocket a little paper and glanced at the headings he had made for his speech. He was undecided about the lines from Robert Browning, for he feared they would be above the heads of his hearers. Some quotation that they would recognise from Shakespeare or from the Melodies would be better. The indelicate clacking of the men's heels and the shuffling of their soles reminded him that their grade of culture differed from his. He would only make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they could not understand. They would think that he was airing his superior education. He would fail with them just as he had failed with the girl in the pantry. He had taken up a wrong tone. His whole speech was a mistake from first to last, an utter failure.\nJust then his aunts and his wife came out of the ladies' dressing-room. His aunts were two small, plainly dressed old women. Aunt Julia was an inch or so the taller. Her hair, drawn low over the tops of her ears, was grey; and grey also, with darker shadows, was her large flaccid face. Though she was stout in build and stood erect, her slow eyes and parted lips gave her the appearance of a woman who did not know where she was or where she was going. Aunt Kate was more vivacious. Her face, healthier than her sister's, was all puckers and creases, like a shrivelled red apple, and her hair, braided in the same old-fashioned way, had not lost its ripe nut colour.\nThey both kissed Gabriel frankly. He was their favourite nephew the son of their dead elder sister, Ellen, who had married T. J. Conroy of the Port and Docks.\n\"Gretta tells me you're not going to take a cab back to Monkstown tonight, Gabriel,\" said Aunt Kate.\n\n\"No,\" said Gabriel, turning to his wife, \"we had quite enough of that last year, hadn't we? Don't you remember, Aunt Kate, what a cold Gretta got out of it? Cab windows rattling all the way, and the east wind blowing in after we passed Merrion. Very jolly it was. Gretta caught a dreadful cold.\"\nAunt Kate frowned severely and nodded her head at every word.\n\n\"Quite right, Gabriel, quite right,\" she said. \"You can't be too careful.\"\n\n\"But as for Gretta there,\" said Gabriel, \"she'd walk home in the snow if she were let.\"\n\nMrs. Conroy laughed.\n\n\"Don't mind him, Aunt Kate,\" she said. \"He's really an awful bother, what with green shades for Tom's eyes at night and making him do the dumb-bells, and forcing Eva to eat the stirabout. The poor child! And she simply hates the sight of it!... O, but you'll never guess what he makes me wear now!\"\n\nShe broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her husband, whose admiring and happy eyes had been wandering from her dress to her face and hair. The two aunts laughed heartily, too, for Gabriel's solicitude was a standing joke with them.\n\"Goloshes!\" said Mrs. Conroy. \"That's the latest. Whenever it's wet underfoot I must put on my galoshes. Tonight even, he wanted me to put them on, but I wouldn't. The next thing he'll buy me will be a diving suit.\"\n\nGabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly, while Aunt Kate nearly doubled herself, so heartily did she enjoy the joke. The smile soon faded from Aunt Julia's face and her mirthless eyes were directed towards her nephew's face. After a pause she asked:\n\n\"And what are goloshes, Gabriel?\"\n\n\"Goloshes, Julia!\" exclaimed her sister \"Goodness me, don't you know what goloshes are? You wear them over your... over your boots, Gretta, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Conroy. \"Guttapercha things. We both have a pair now. Gabriel says everyone wears them on the Continent.\"\n\n\"O, on the Continent,\" murmured Aunt Julia, nodding her head slowly.\n\nGabriel knitted his brows and said, as if he were slightly angered:\n\"It's nothing very wonderful, but Gretta thinks it very funny because she says the word reminds her of Christy Minstrels.\"\n\n\"But tell me, Gabriel,\" said Aunt Kate, with brisk tact. \"Of course, you've seen about the room. Gretta was saying...\"\n\n\"0, the room is all right,\" replied Gabriel. \"I've taken one in the Gresham.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Aunt Kate, \"by far the best thing to do. And the children, Gretta, you're not anxious about them?\"\n\n\"0, for one night,\" said Mrs. Conroy. \"Besides, Bessie will look after them.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Aunt Kate again. \"What a comfort it is to have a girl like that, one you can depend on! There's that Lily, I'm sure I don't know what has come over her lately. She's not the girl she was at all.\"\n\nGabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point, but she broke off suddenly to gaze after her sister, who had wandered down the stairs and was craning her neck over the banisters.\n\n\"Now, I ask you,\" she said almost testily, \"where is Julia going? Julia! Julia! Where are you going?\"\n\nJulia, who had gone half way down one flight, came back and announced blandly:\n\n\"Here's Freddy.\"\n\nAt the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of the pianist told that the waltz had ended. The drawing-room door was opened from within and some couples came out. Aunt Kate drew Gabriel aside hurriedly and whispered into his ear:\n\n\"Slip down, Gabriel, like a good fellow and see if he's all right, and don't let him up if he's screwed. I'm sure he's screwed. I'm sure he is.\"\n\nGabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters. He could hear two persons talking in the pantry. Then he recognised Freddy Malins' laugh. He went down the stairs noisily.\n\n\"It's such a relief,\" said Aunt Kate to Mrs. Conroy, \"that Gabriel is here. I always feel easier in my mind when he's here.... Julia, there's Miss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment. Thanks for your beautiful waltz, Miss Daly. It made lovely time.\"\n\nA tall wizen-faced man, with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy skin, who was passing out with his partner, said:\n\n\"And may we have some refreshment, too, Miss Morkan?\"\n\n\"Julia,\" said Aunt Kate summarily, \"and here's Mr. Browne and Miss Furlong. Take them in, Julia, with Miss Daly and Miss Power.\"\n\n\"I'm the man for the ladies,\" said Mr. Browne, pursing his lips until his moustache bristled and smiling in all his wrinkles. \"You know, Miss Morkan, the reason they are so fond of me is----\"\n\nHe did not finish his sentence, but, seeing that Aunt Kate was out of earshot, at once led the three young ladies into the back room. The middle of the room was occupied by two square tables placed end to end, and on these Aunt Julia and the caretaker were straightening and smoothing a large cloth. On the sideboard were arrayed dishes and plates, and glasses and bundles of knives and forks and spoons. The top of the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands and sweets. At a smaller sideboard in one corner two young men were standing, drinking hop-bitters.\n\nMr. Browne led his charges thither and invited them all, in jest, to some ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. As they said they never took anything strong, he opened three bottles of lemonade for them. Then he asked one of the young men to move aside, and, taking hold of the decanter, filled out for himself a goodly measure of whisky. The young men eyed him respectfully while he took a trial sip.\n\n\"God help me,\" he said, smiling, \"it's the doctor's orders.\"\n\nHis wizened face broke into a broader smile, and the three young ladies laughed in musical echo to his pleasantry, swaying their bodies to and fro, with nervous jerks of their shoulders. The boldest said:\n\n\"O, now, Mr. Browne, I'm sure the doctor never ordered anything of the kind.\"\n\nMr. Browne took another sip of his whisky and said, with sidling mimicry:\n\n\"Well, you see, I'm like the famous Mrs. Cassidy, who is reported to have said: 'Now, Mary Grimes, if I don't take it, make me take it, for I feel I want it.'\"\n\nHis hot face had leaned forward a little too confidentially and he had assumed a very low Dublin accent so that the young ladies, with one instinct, received his speech in silence. Miss Furlong, who was one of Mary Jane's pupils, asked Miss Daly what was the name of the pretty waltz she had played; and Mr. Browne, seeing that he was ignored, turned promptly to the two young men who were more appreciative.\n\nA red-faced young woman, dressed in pansy, came into the room, excitedly clapping her hands and crying:\n\n\"Quadrilles! Quadrilles!\"\n\nClose on her heels came Aunt Kate, crying:\n\n\"Two gentlemen and three ladies, Mary Jane!\"\n\n\"O, here's Mr. Bergin and Mr. Kerrigan,\" said Mary Jane. \"Mr. Kerrigan, will you take Miss Power? Miss Furlong, may I get you a partner, Mr. Bergin. O, that'll just do now.\"\n\n\"Three ladies, Mary Jane,\" said Aunt Kate.\n\nThe two young gentlemen asked the ladies if they might have the pleasure, and Mary Jane turned to Miss Daly.\n\n\"O, Miss Daly, you're really awfully good, after playing for the last two dances, but really we're so short of ladies tonight.\"\n\n\"I don't mind in the least, Miss Morkan.\"\n\n\"But I've a nice partner for you, Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, the tenor. I'll get him to sing later on. All Dublin is raving about him.\"\n\n\"Lovely voice, lovely voice!\" said Aunt Kate.\n\nAs the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure Mary Jane led her recruits quickly from the room. They had hardly gone when Aunt Julia wandered slowly into the room, looking behind her at something.\n\n\"What is the matter, Julia?\" asked Aunt Kate anxiously. \"Who is it?\"\n\nJulia, who was carrying in a column of table-napkins, turned to her sister and said, simply, as if the question had surprised her:\n\n\"It's only Freddy, Kate, and Gabriel with him.\"\n\nIn fact right behind her Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy Malins across the landing. The latter, a young man of about forty, was of Gabriel's size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye.\n\n\"Good-evening, Freddy,\" said Aunt Julia.\n\nFreddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then, seeing that Mr. Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to Gabriel.\n\n\"He's not so bad, is he?\" said Aunt Kate to Gabriel.\n\nGabriel's brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered:\n\n\"O, no, hardly noticeable.\"\n\n\"Now, isn't he a terrible fellow!\" she said. \"And his poor mother made him take the pledge on New Year's Eve. But come on, Gabriel, into the drawing-room.\"\n\nBefore leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr. Browne by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro. Mr. Browne nodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy Malins:\n\n\"Now, then, Teddy, I'm going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up.\"\n\nFreddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved the offer aside impatiently but Mr. Browne, having first called Freddy Malins' attention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and handed him a full glass of lemonade. Freddy Malins' left hand accepted the glass mechanically, his right hand being engaged in the mechanical readjustment of his dress. Mr. Browne, whose face was once more wrinkling with mirth, poured out for himself a glass of whisky while Freddy Malins exploded, before he had well reached the climax of his story, in a kink of high-pitched bronchitic laughter and, setting down his untasted and overflowing glass, began to rub the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye, repeating words of his last phrase as well as his fit of laughter would allow him.\n\nGabriel could not listen while Mary Jane was playing her Academy piece, full of runs and difficult passages, to the hushed drawing-room. He liked music but the piece she was playing had no melody for him and he doubted whether it had any melody for the other listeners, though they had begged Mary Jane to play something. Four young men, who had come from the refreshment-room to stand in the doorway at the sound of the piano, had gone away quietly in couples after a few minutes. The only persons who seemed to follow the music were Mary Jane herself, her hands racing along the key-board or lifted from it at the pauses like those of a priestess in momentary imprecation, and Aunt Kate standing at her elbow to turn the page.\n\nGabriel's eyes, irritated by the floor, which glittered with beeswax under the heavy chandelier, wandered to the wall above the piano. A picture of the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet hung there and beside it was a picture of the two murdered princes in the Tower which Aunt Julia had worked in red, blue and brown wools when she was a girl. Probably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had been taught for one year. His mother had worked for him as a birthday present a waistcoat of purple tabinet, with little foxes' heads upon it, lined with brown satin and having round mulberry buttons. It was strange that his mother had had no musical talent though Aunt Kate used to call her the brains carrier of the Morkan family. Both she and Julia had always seemed a little proud of their serious and matronly sister. Her photograph stood before the pierglass. She held an open book on her knees and was pointing out something in it to Constantine who, dressed in a man-o-war suit, lay at her feet. It was she who had chosen the name of her sons for she was very sensible of the dignity of family life. Thanks to her, Constantine was now senior curate in Balbrigan and, thanks to her, Gabriel himself had taken his degree in the Royal University. A shadow passed over his face as he remembered her sullen opposition to his marriage. Some slighting phrases she had used still rankled in his memory; she had once spoken of Gretta as being country cute and that was not true of Gretta at all. It was Gretta who had nursed her during all her last long illness in their house at Monkstown.\n\nHe knew that Mary Jane must be near the end of her piece for she was playing again the opening melody with runs of scales after every bar and while he waited for the end the resentment died down in his heart. The piece ended with a trill of octaves in the treble and a final deep octave in the bass. Great applause greeted Mary Jane as, blushing and rolling up her music nervously, she escaped from the room. The most vigorous clapping came from the four young men in the doorway who had gone away to the refreshment-room at the beginning of the piece but had come back when the piano had stopped.\n\nLancers were arranged. Gabriel found himself partnered with Miss Ivors. She was a frank-mannered talkative young lady, with a freckled face and prominent brown eyes. She did not wear a low-cut bodice and the large brooch which was fixed in the front of her collar bore on it an Irish device and motto.\n\nWhen they had taken their places she said abruptly:\n\n\"I have a crow to pluck with you.\"\n\n\"With me?\" said Gabriel.\n\nShe nodded her head gravely.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Gabriel, smiling at her solemn manner.\n\n\"Who is G. C.?\" answered Miss Ivors, turning her eyes upon him.\n\nGabriel coloured and was about to knit his brows, as if he did not understand, when she said bluntly:\n\n\"O, innocent Amy! I have found out that you write for The Daily Express. Now, aren't you ashamed of yourself?\"\n\n\"Why should I be ashamed of myself?\" asked Gabriel, blinking his eyes and trying to smile.\n\n\"Well, I'm ashamed of you,\" said Miss Ivors frankly. \"To say you'd write for a paper like that. I didn't think you were a West Briton.\"\n\nA look of perplexity appeared on Gabriel's face. It was true that he wrote a literary column every Wednesday in The Daily Express, for which he was paid fifteen shillings. But that did not make him a West Briton surely. The books he received for review were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque. He loved to feel the covers and turn over the pages of newly printed books. Nearly every day when his teaching in the college was ended he used to wander down the quays to the second-hand booksellers, to Hickey's on Bachelor's Walk, to Web's or Massey's on Aston's Quay, or to O'Clohissey's in the bystreet. He did not know how to meet her charge. He wanted to say that literature was above politics. But they were friends of many years' standing and their careers had been parallel, first at the University and then as teachers: he could not risk a grandiose phrase with her. He continued blinking his eyes and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw nothing political in writing reviews of books.\n\nWhen their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and inattentive. Miss Ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and said in a soft friendly tone:\n\n\"Of course, I was only joking. Come, we cross now.\"\n\nWhen they were together again she spoke of the University question and Gabriel felt more at ease. A friend of hers had shown her his review of Browning's poems. That was how she had found out the secret: but she liked the review immensely. Then she said suddenly:\n\n\"O, Mr. Conroy, will you come for an excursion to the Aran Isles this summer? We're going to stay there a whole month. It will be splendid out in the Atlantic. You ought to come. Mr. Clancy is coming, and Mr. Kilkelly and Kathleen Kearney. It would be splendid for Gretta too if she'd come. She's from Connacht, isn't she?\"\n\n\"Her people are,\" said Gabriel shortly.\n\"But you will come, won't you?\" said Miss Ivors, laying her arm hand eagerly on his arm.\n\n\"The fact is,\" said Gabriel, \"I have just arranged to go----\"\n\n\"Go where?\" asked Miss Ivors.\n\n\"Well, you know, every year I go for a cycling tour with some fellows and so----\"\n\n\"But where?\" asked Miss Ivors.\n\n\"Well, we usually go to France or Belgium or perhaps Germany,\" said Gabriel awkwardly.\n\n\"And why do you go to France and Belgium,\" said Miss Ivors, \"instead of visiting your own land?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Gabriel, \"it's partly to keep in touch with the languages and partly for a change.\"\n\n\"And haven't you your own language to keep in touch with -- Irish?\" asked Miss Ivors.\n\n\"Well,\" said Gabriel, \"if it comes to that, you know, Irish is not my language.\"\n\nTheir neighbours had turned to listen to the cross-examination. Gabriel glanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his good humour under the ordeal which was making a blush invade his forehead.\n\"And haven't you your own land to visit,\" continued Miss Ivors, \"that you know nothing of, your own people, and your own country?\"\n\"0, to tell you the truth,\" retorted Gabriel suddenly, \"I'm sick of my own country, sick of it!\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Miss Ivors.\n\nGabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him.\n\n\"Why?\" repeated Miss Ivors.\n\nThey had to go visiting together and, as he had not answered her, Miss Ivors said warmly:\n\n\"Of course, you've no answer.\"\n\nGabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with great energy. He avoided her eyes for he had seen a sour expression on her face. But when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel his hand firmly pressed. She looked at him from under her brows for a moment quizzically until he smiled. Then, just as the chain was about to start again, she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear:\n\n\"West Briton!\"\n\nWhen the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner of the room where Freddy Malins' mother was sitting. She was a stout feeble old woman with white hair. Her voice had a catch in it like her son's and she stuttered slightly. She had been told that Freddy had come and that he was nearly all right. Gabriel asked her whether she had had a good crossing. She lived with her married daughter in Glasgow and came to Dublin on a visit once a year. She answered placidly that she had had a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her. She spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in Glasgow, and of all the friends they had there. While her tongue rambled on Gabriel tried to banish from his mind all memory of the unpleasant incident with Miss Ivors. Of course the girl or woman, or whatever she was, was an enthusiast but there was a time for all things. Perhaps he ought not to have answered her like that. But she had no right to call him a West Briton before people, even in joke. She had tried to make him ridiculous before people, heckling him and staring at him with her rabbit's eyes.\n\nHe saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing couples. When she reached him she said into his ear:\n\n\"Gabriel. Aunt Kate wants to know won't you carve the goose as usual. Miss Daly will carve the ham and I'll do the pudding.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"She's sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz is over so that we'll have the table to ourselves.\"\n\n\"Were you dancing?\" asked Gabriel.\n\n\"Of course I was. Didn't you see me? What row had you with Molly Ivors?\"\n\n\"No row. Why? Did she say so?\"\n\n\"Something like that. I'm trying to get that Mr. D'Arcy to sing. He's full of conceit, I think.\"\n\n\"There was no row,\" said Gabriel moodily, \"only she wanted me to go for a trip to the west of Ireland and I said I wouldn't.\"\n\nHis wife clasped her hands excitedly and gave a little jump.\n\n\"O, do go, Gabriel,\" she cried. \"I'd love to see Galway again.\"\n\n\"You can go if you like,\" said Gabriel coldly.\n\nShe looked at him for a moment, then turned to Mrs. Malins and said:\n\n\"There's a nice husband for you, Mrs. Malins.\"\n\nWhile she was threading her way back across the room Mrs. Malins, without adverting to the interruption, went on to tell Gabriel what beautiful places there were in Scotland and beautiful scenery. Her son-in-law brought them every year to the lakes and they used to go fishing. Her son-in-law was a splendid fisher. One day he caught a beautiful big fish and the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner.\n\nGabriel hardly heard what she said. Now that supper was coming near he began to think again about his speech and about the quotation. When he saw Freddy Malins coming across the room to visit his mother Gabriel left the chair free for him and retired into the embrasure of the window. The room had already cleared and from the back room came the clatter of plates and knives. Those who still remained in the drawing room seemed tired of dancing and were conversing quietly in little groups. Gabriel's warm trembling fingers tapped the cold pane of the window. How cool it must be outside! How pleasant it would be to walk out alone, first along by the river and then through the park! The snow would be lying on the branches of the trees and forming a bright cap on the top of the Wellington Monument. How much more pleasant it would be there than at the supper-table!\n\nHe ran over the headings of his speech: Irish hospitality, sad memories, the Three Graces, Paris, the quotation from Browning. He repeated to himself a phrase he had written in his review: \"One feels that one is listening to a thought- tormented music.\" Miss Ivors had praised the review. Was she sincere? Had she really any life of her own behind all her propagandism? There had never been any ill-feeling between them until that night. It unnerved him to think that she would be at the supper-table, looking up at him while he spoke with her critical quizzing eyes. Perhaps she would not be sorry to see him fail in his speech. An idea came into his mind and gave him courage. He would say, alluding to Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia: \"Ladies and Gentlemen, the generation which is now on the wane among us may have had its faults but for my part I think it had certain qualities of hospitality, of humour, of humanity, which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation that is growing up around us seems to me to lack.\" Very good: that was one for Miss Ivors. What did he care that his aunts were only two ignorant old women?\n\nA murmur in the room attracted his attention. Mr. Browne was advancing from the door, gallantly escorting Aunt Julia, who leaned upon his arm, smiling and hanging her head. An irregular musketry of applause escorted her also as far as the piano and then, as Mary Jane seated herself on the stool, and Aunt Julia, no longer smiling, half turned so as to pitch her voice fairly into the room, gradually ceased. Gabriel recognised the prelude. It was that of an old song of Aunt Julia's -- Arrayed for the Bridal. Her voice, strong and clear in tone, attacked with great spirit the runs which embellish the air and though she sang very rapidly she did not miss even the smallest of the grace notes. To follow the voice, without looking at the singer's face, was to feel and share the excitement of swift and secure flight. Gabriel applauded loudly with all the others at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from the invisible supper-table. It sounded so genuine that a little colour struggled into Aunt Julia's face as she bent to replace in the music-stand the old leather-bound songbook that had her initials on the cover. Freddy Malins, who had listened with his head perched sideways to hear her better, was still applauding when everyone else had ceased and talking animatedly to his mother who nodded her head gravely and slowly in acquiescence. At last, when he could clap no more, he stood up suddenly and hurried across the room to Aunt Julia whose hand he seized and held in both his hands, shaking it when words failed him or the catch in his voice proved too much for him.\n\n\"I was just telling my mother,\" he said, \"I never heard you sing so well, never. No, I never heard your voice so good as it is tonight. Now! Would you believe that now? That's the truth. Upon my word and honour that's the truth. I never heard your voice sound so fresh and so... so clear and fresh, never.\"\n\nAunt Julia smiled broadly and murmured something about compliments as she released her hand from his grasp. Mr. Browne extended his open hand towards her and said to those who were near him in the manner of a showman introducing a prodigy to an audience:\n\n\"Miss Julia Morkan, my latest discovery!\"\n\nHe was laughing very heartily at this himself when Freddy Malins turned to him and said:\n\n\"Well, Browne, if you're serious you might make a worse discovery. All I can say is I never heard her sing half so well as long as I am coming here. And that's the honest truth.\"\n\n\"Neither did I,\" said Mr. Browne. \"I think her voice has greatly improved.\"\n\nAunt Julia shrugged her shoulders and said with meek pride:\n\n\"Thirty years ago I hadn't a bad voice as voices go.\"\n\n\"I often told Julia,\" said Aunt Kate emphatically, \"that she was simply thrown away in that choir. But she never would be said by me.\"\n\nShe turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the others against a refractory child while Aunt Julia gazed in front of her, a vague smile of reminiscence playing on her face.\n\n\"No,\" continued Aunt Kate, \"she wouldn't be said or led by anyone, slaving there in that choir night and day, night and day. Six o'clock on Christmas morning! And all for what?\"\n\n\"Well, isn't it for the honour of God, Aunt Kate?\" asked Mary Jane, twisting round on the piano-stool and smiling.\n\nAunt Kate turned fiercely on her niece and said:\n\n\"I know all about the honour of God, Mary Jane, but I think it's not at all honourable for the pope to turn out the women out of the choirs that have slaved there all their lives and put little whipper-snappers of boys over their heads. I suppose it is for the good of the Church if the pope does it. But it's not just, Mary Jane, and it's not right.\"\n\nShe had worked herself into a passion and would have continued in defence of her sister for it was a sore subject with her but Mary Jane, seeing that all the dancers had come back, intervened pacifically:\n\n\"Now, Aunt Kate, you're giving scandal to Mr. Browne who is of the other persuasion.\"\n\nAunt Kate turned to Mr. Browne, who was grinning at this allusion to his religion, and said hastily:\n\n\"O, I don't question the pope's being right. I'm only a stupid old woman and I wouldn't presume to do such a thing. But there's such a thing as common everyday politeness and gratitude. And if I were in Julia's place I'd tell that Father Healey straight up to his face...\"\n\n\"And besides, Aunt Kate,\" said Mary Jane, \"we really are all hungry and when we are hungry we are all very quarrelsome.\"\n\n\"And when we are thirsty we are also quarrelsome,\" added Mr. Browne.\n\n\"So that we had better go to supper,\" said Mary Jane, \"and finish the discussion afterwards.\"\n\nOn the landing outside the drawing-room Gabriel found his wife and Mary Jane trying to persuade Miss Ivors to stay for supper. But Miss Ivors, who had put on her hat and was buttoning her cloak, would not stay. She did not feel in the least hungry and she had already overstayed her time.\n\n\"But only for ten minutes, Molly,\" said Mrs. Conroy. \"That won't delay you.\"\n\n\"To take a pick itself,\" said Mary Jane, \"after all your dancing.\"\n\n\"I really couldn't,\" said Miss Ivors.\n\n\"I am afraid you didn't enjoy yourself at all,\" said Mary Jane hopelessly.\n\n\"Ever so much, I assure you,\" said Miss Ivors, \"but you really must let me run off now.\"\n\n\"But how can you get home?\" asked Mrs. Conroy.\n\n\"O, it's only two steps up the quay.\"\n\nGabriel hesitated a moment and said:\n\n\"If you will allow me, Miss Ivors, I'll see you home if you are really obliged to go.\"\n\nBut Miss Ivors broke away from them.\n\n\"I won't hear of it,\" she cried. \"For goodness' sake go in to your suppers and don't mind me. I'm quite well able to take care of myself.\"\n\n\"Well, you're the comical girl, Molly,\" said Mrs. Conroy frankly.\n\n\"Beannacht libh,\" cried Miss Ivors, with a laugh, as she ran down the staircase.\n\nMary Jane gazed after her, a moody puzzled expression on her face, while Mrs. Conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the hall-door. Gabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt departure. But she did not seem to be in ill humour: she had gone away laughing. He stared blankly down the staircase.\n\nAt the moment Aunt Kate came toddling out of the supper-room, almost wringing her hands in despair.\n\n\"Where is Gabriel?\" she cried. \"Where on earth is Gabriel? There's everyone waiting in there, stage to let, and nobody to carve the goose!\"\n\n\"Here I am, Aunt Kate!\" cried Gabriel, with sudden animation, \"ready to carve a flock of geese, if necessary.\"\n\nA fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end, on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a great ham, stripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef. Between these rival ends ran parallel lines of side-dishes: two little minsters of jelly, red and yellow; a shallow dish full of blocks of blancmange and red jam, a large green leaf-shaped dish with a stalk-shaped handle, on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds, a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna figs, a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of chocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase in which stood some tall celery stalks. In the centre of the table there stood, as sentries to a fruit-stand which upheld a pyramid of oranges and American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of cut glass, one containing port and the other dark sherry. On the closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals, drawn up according to the colours of their uniforms, the first two black, with brown and red labels, the third and smallest squad white, with transverse green sashes.\n\nGabriel took his seat boldly at the head of the table and, having looked to the edge of the carver, plunged his fork firmly into the goose. He felt quite at ease now for he was an expert carver and liked nothing better than to find himself at the head of a well-laden table.\n\n\"Miss Furlong, what shall I send you?\" he asked. \"A wing or a slice of the breast?\"\n\n\"Just a small slice of the breast.\"\n\n\"Miss Higgins, what for you?\"\n\n\"O, anything at all, Mr. Conroy.\"\n\nWhile Gabriel and Miss Daly exchanged plates of goose and plates of ham and spiced beef Lily went from guest to guest with a dish of hot floury potatoes wrapped in a white napkin. This was Mary Jane's idea and she had also suggested apple sauce for the goose but Aunt Kate had said that plain roast goose without any apple sauce had always been good enough for her and she hoped she might never eat worse. Mary Jane waited on her pupils and saw that they got the best slices and Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia opened and carried across from the piano bottles of stout and ale for the gentlemen and bottles of minerals for the ladies. There was a great deal of confusion and laughter and noise, the noise of orders and counter-orders, of knives and forks, of corks and glass-stoppers. Gabriel began to carve second helpings as soon as he had finished the first round without serving himself. Everyone protested loudly so that he compromised by taking a long draught of stout for he had found the carving hot work. Mary Jane settled down quietly to her supper but Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia were still toddling round the table, walking on each other's heels, getting in each other's way and giving each other unheeded orders. Mr. Browne begged of them to sit down and eat their suppers and so did Gabriel but they said there was time enough, so that, at last, Freddy Malins stood up and, capturing Aunt Kate, plumped her down on her chair amid general laughter.\n\nWhen everyone had been well served Gabriel said, smiling:\n\n\"Now, if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call stuffing let him or her speak.\"\n\nA chorus of voices invited him to begin his own supper and Lily came forward with three potatoes which she had reserved for him.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Gabriel amiably, as he took another preparatory draught, \"kindly forget my existence, ladies and gentlemen, for a few minutes.\"\n\nHe set to his supper and took no part in the conversation with which the table covered Lily's removal of the plates. The subject of talk was the opera company which was then at the Theatre Royal. Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, the tenor, a dark- complexioned young man with a smart moustache, praised very highly the leading contralto of the company but Miss Furlong thought she had a rather vulgar style of production. Freddy Malins said there was a Negro chieftain singing in the second part of the Gaiety pantomime who had one of the finest tenor voices he had ever heard.\n\n\"Have you heard him?\" he asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy across the table.\n\n\"No,\" answered Mr. Bartell D'Arcy carelessly.\n\n\"Because,\" Freddy Malins explained, \"now I'd be curious to hear your opinion of him. I think he has a grand voice.\"\n\n\"It takes Teddy to find out the really good things,\" said Mr. Browne familiarly to the table.\n\n\"And why couldn't he have a voice too?\" asked Freddy Malins sharply. \"Is it because he's only a black?\"\n\nNobody answered this question and Mary Jane led the table back to the legitimate opera. One of her pupils had given her a pass for Mignon. Of course it was very fine, she said, but it made her think of poor Georgina Burns. Mr. Browne could go back farther still, to the old Italian companies that used to come to Dublin -- Tietjens, Ilma de Murzka, Campanini, the great Trebelli, Giuglini, Ravelli, Aramburo. Those were the days, he said, when there was something like singing to be heard in Dublin. He told too of how the top gallery of the old Royal used to be packed night after night, of how one night an Italian tenor had sung five encores to Let me like a Soldier fall, introducing a high C every time, and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm unyoke the horses from the carriage of some great prima donna and pull her themselves through the streets to her hotel. Why did they never play the grand old operas now, he asked, Dinorah, Lucrezia Borgia? Because they could not get the voices to sing them: that was why.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, \"I presume there are as good singers today as there were then.\"\n\n\"Where are they?\" asked Mr. Browne defiantly.\n\n\"In London, Paris, Milan,\" said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy warmly. \"I suppose Caruso, for example, is quite as good, if not better than any of the men you have mentioned.\"\n\n\"Maybe so,\" said Mr. Browne. \"But I may tell you I doubt it strongly.\"\n\n\"O, I'd give anything to hear Caruso sing,\" said Mary Jane.\n\n\"For me,\" said Aunt Kate, who had been picking a bone, \"there was only one tenor. To please me, I mean. But I suppose none of you ever heard of him.\"\n\n\"Who was he, Miss Morkan?\" asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy politely.\n\n\"His name,\" said Aunt Kate, \"was Parkinson. I heard him when he was in his prime and I think he had then the purest tenor voice that was ever put into a man's throat.\"\n\n\"Strange,\" said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy. \"I never even heard of him.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Miss Morkan is right,\" said Mr. Browne. \"I remember hearing of old Parkinson but he's too far back for me.\"\n\n\"A beautiful, pure, sweet, mellow English tenor,\" said Aunt Kate with enthusiasm.\n\nGabriel having finished, the huge pudding was transferred to the table. The clatter of forks and spoons began again. Gabriel's wife served out spoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plates down the table. Midway down they were held up by Mary Jane, who replenished them with raspberry or orange jelly or with blancmange and jam. The pudding was of Aunt Julia's making and she received praises for it from all quarters She herself said that it was not quite brown enough.\n\n\"Well, I hope, Miss Morkan,\" said Mr. Browne, \"that I'm brown enough for you because, you know, I'm all brown.\"\n\nAll the gentlemen, except Gabriel, ate some of the pudding out of compliment to Aunt Julia. As Gabriel never ate sweets the celery had been left for him. Freddy Malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it with his pudding. He had been told that celery was a capital thing for the blood and he was just then under doctor's care. Mrs. Malins, who had been silent all through the supper, said that her son was going down to Mount Melleray in a week or so. The table then spoke of Mount Melleray, how bracing the air was down there, how hospitable the monks were and how they never asked for a penny-piece from their guests.\n\n\"And do you mean to say,\" asked Mr. Browne incredulously, \"that a chap can go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on the fat of the land and then come away without paying anything?\"\n\n\"O, most people give some donation to the monastery when they leave.\" said Mary Jane.\n\n\"I wish we had an institution like that in our Church,\" said Mr. Browne candidly.\n\nHe was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke, got up at two in the morning and slept in their coffins. He asked what they did it for.\n\n\"That's the rule of the order,\" said Aunt Kate firmly.\n\n\"Yes, but why?\" asked Mr. Browne.\n\nAunt Kate repeated that it was the rule, that was all. Mr. Browne still seemed not to understand. Freddy Malins explained to him, as best he could, that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by all the sinners in the outside world. The explanation was not very clear for Mr. Browne grinned and said:\n\n\"I like that idea very much but wouldn't a comfortable spring bed do them as well as a coffin?\"\n\n\"The coffin,\" said Mary Jane, \"is to remind them of their last end.\"\n\nAs the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the table during which Mrs. Malins could be heard saying to her neighbour in an indistinct undertone:\n\n\"They are very good men, the monks, very pious men.\"\n\nThe raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates and sweets were now passed about the table and Aunt Julia invited all the guests to have either port or sherry. At first Mr. Bartell D'Arcy refused to take either but one of his neighbours nudged him and whispered something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be filled. Gradually as the last glasses were being filled the conversation ceased. A pause followed, broken only by the noise of the wine and by unsettlings of chairs. The Misses Morkan, all three, looked down at the tablecloth. Someone coughed once or twice and then a few gentlemen patted the table gently as a signal for silence. The silence came and Gabriel pushed back his chair.\n\nThe patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased altogether. Gabriel leaned his ten trembling fingers on the tablecloth and smiled nervously at the company. Meeting a row of upturned faces he raised his eyes to the chandelier. The piano was playing a waltz tune and he could hear the skirts sweeping against the drawing-room door. People, perhaps, were standing in the snow on the quay outside, gazing up at the lighted windows and listening to the waltz music. The air was pure there. In the distance lay the park where the trees were weighted with snow. The Wellington Monument wore a gleaming cap of snow that flashed westward over the white field of Fifteen Acres.\n\nHe began:\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen.\n\n\"It has fallen to my lot this evening, as in years past, to perform a very pleasing task but a task for which I am afraid my poor powers as a speaker are all too inadequate.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said Mr. Browne.\n\n\"But, however that may be, I can only ask you tonight to take the will for the deed and to lend me your attention for a few moments while I endeavour to express to you in words what my feelings are on this occasion.\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, it is not the first time that we have gathered together under this hospitable roof, around this hospitable board. It is not the first time that we have been the recipients -- or perhaps, I had better say, the victims -- of the hospitality of certain good ladies.\"\n\nHe made a circle in the air with his arm and paused. Everyone laughed or smiled at Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia and Mary Jane who all turned crimson with pleasure. Gabriel went on more boldly:\n\n\"I feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country has no tradition which does it so much honour and which it should guard so jealously as that of its hospitality. It is a tradition that is unique as far as my experience goes (and I have visited not a few places abroad) among the modern nations. Some would say, perhaps, that with us it is rather a failing than anything to be boasted of. But granted even that, it is, to my mind, a princely failing, and one that I trust will long be cultivated among us. Of one thing, at least, I am sure. As long as this one roof shelters the good ladies aforesaid -- and I wish from my heart it may do so for many and many a long year to come -- the tradition of genuine warm-hearted courteous Irish hospitality, which our forefathers have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down to our descendants, is still alive among us.\"\n\nA hearty murmur of assent ran round the table. It shot through Gabriel's mind that Miss Ivors was not there and that she had gone away discourteously: and he said with confidence in himself:\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen.\n\n\"A new generation is growing up in our midst, a generation actuated by new ideas and new principles. It is serious and enthusiastic for these new ideas and its enthusiasm, even when it is misdirected, is, I believe, in the main sincere. But we are living in a sceptical and, if I may use the phrase, a thought-tormented age: and sometimes I fear that this new generation, educated or hypereducated as it is, will lack those qualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humour which belonged to an older day. Listening tonight to the names of all those great singers of the past it seemed to me, I must confess, that we were living in a less spacious age. Those days might, without exaggeration, be called spacious days: and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope, at least, that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of them with pride and affection, still cherish in our hearts the memory of those dead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not willingly let die.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" said Mr. Browne loudly.\n\n\"But yet,\" continued Gabriel, his voice falling into a softer inflection, \"there are always in gatherings such as this sadder thoughts that will recur to our minds: thoughts of the past, of youth, of changes, of absent faces that we miss here tonight. Our path through life is strewn with many such sad memories: and were we to brood upon them always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work among the living. We have all of us living duties and living affections which claim, and rightly claim, our strenuous endeavours.\n\n\"Therefore, I will not linger on the past. I will not let any gloomy moralising intrude upon us here tonight. Here we are gathered together for a brief moment from the bustle and rush of our everyday routine. We are met here as friends, in the spirit of good-fellowship, as colleagues, also to a certain extent, in the true spirit of camaraderie, and as the guests of -- what shall I call them? -- the Three Graces of the Dublin musical world.\"\n\nThe table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion. Aunt Julia vainly asked each of her neighbours in turn to tell her what Gabriel had said.\n\n\"He says we are the Three Graces, Aunt Julia,\" said Mary Jane.\n\nAunt Julia did not understand but she looked up, smiling, at Gabriel, who continued in the same vein:\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen.\n\n\"I will not attempt to play tonight the part that Paris played on another occasion. I will not attempt to choose between them. The task would be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers. For when I view them in turn, whether it be our chief hostess herself, whose good heart, whose too good heart, has become a byword with all who know her, or her sister, who seems to be gifted with perennial youth and whose singing must have been a surprise and a revelation to us all tonight, or, last but not least, when I consider our youngest hostess, talented, cheerful, hard-working and the best of nieces, I confess, Ladies and Gentlemen, that I do not know to which of them I should award the prize.\"\n\nGabriel glanced down at his aunts and, seeing the large smile on Aunt Julia's face and the tears which had risen to Aunt Kate's eyes, hastened to his close. He raised his glass of port gallantly, while every member of the company fingered a glass expectantly, and said loudly:\n\n\"Let us toast them all three together. Let us drink to their health, wealth, long life, happiness and prosperity and may they long continue to hold the proud and self-won position which they hold in their profession and the position of honour and affection which they hold in our hearts.\"\n\nAll the guests stood up, glass in hand, and turning towards the three seated ladies, sang in unison, with Mr. Browne as leader:\n\nFor they are jolly gay fellows\nFor they are jolly gay fellows\nFor they are jolly gay fellows\nWhich nobody can deny.\n\nAunt Kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even Aunt Julia seemed moved. Freddy Malins beat time with his pudding-fork and the singers turned towards one another, as if in melodious conference, while they sang with emphasis:\n\nUnless he tells a lie\nUnless he tells a lie.\n\nThen, turning once more towards their hostesses, they sang:\n\nFor they are jolly gay fellows\nFor they are jolly gay fellows\nFor they are jolly gay fellows\nWhich nobody can deny.\n\nThe acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the supper-room by many of the other guests and renewed time after time, Freddy Malins acting as officer with his fork on high.\n\nThe piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so that Aunt Kate said:\n\n\"Close the door, somebody. Mrs. Malins will get her death of cold.\"\n\n\"Browne is out there, Aunt Kate,\" said Mary Jane.\n\n\"Browne is everywhere,\" said Aunt Kate, lowering her voice.\n\nMary Jane laughed at her tone.\n\n\"Really,\" she said archly, \"he is very attentive.\"\n\n\"He has been laid on here like the gas,\" said Aunt Kate in the same tone, \"all during the Christmas.\"\n\nShe laughed herself this time good-humouredly and then added quickly:\n\n\"But tell him to come in, Mary Jane, and close the door. I hope to goodness he didn't hear me.\"\n\nAt that moment the hall-door was opened and Mr. Browne came in from the doorstep, laughing as if his heart would break. He was dressed in a long green overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on his head an oval fur cap. He pointed down the snow-covered quay from where the sound of shrill prolonged whistling was borne in.\n\n\"Teddy will have all the cabs in Dublin out,\" he said.\n\nGabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office, struggling into his overcoat and, looking round the hall, said:\n\n\"Gretta not down yet?\"\n\n\"She's getting on her things, Gabriel,\" said Aunt Kate.\n\n\"Who's playing up there?\" asked Gabriel.\n\n\"Nobody. They're all gone.\"\n\n\"O no, Aunt Kate,\" said Mary Jane. \"Bartell D'Arcy and Miss O'Callaghan aren't gone yet.\"\n\n\"Someone is fooling at the piano anyhow,\" said Gabriel.\n\nMary Jane glanced at Gabriel and Mr. Browne and said with a shiver:\n\n\"It makes me feel cold to look at you two gentlemen muffled up like that. I wouldn't like to face your journey home at this hour.\"\n\n\"I'd like nothing better this minute,\" said Mr. Browne stoutly, \"than a rattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a good spanking goer between the shafts.\"\n\n\"We used to have a very good horse and trap at home,\" said Aunt Julia sadly.\n\n\"The never-to-be-forgotten Johnny,\" said Mary Jane, laughing.\n\nAunt Kate and Gabriel laughed too.\n\n\"Why, what was wonderful about Johnny?\" asked Mr. Browne.\n\n\"The late lamented Patrick Morkan, our grandfather, that is,\" explained Gabriel, \"commonly known in his later years as the old gentleman, was a glue-boiler.\"\n\n\"O, now, Gabriel,\" said Aunt Kate, laughing, \"he had a starch mill.\"\n\n\"Well, glue or starch,\" said Gabriel, \"the old gentleman had a horse by the name of Johnny. And Johnny used to work in the old gentleman's mill, walking round and round in order to drive the mill. That was all very well; but now comes the tragic part about Johnny. One fine day the old gentleman thought he'd like to drive out with the quality to a military review in the park.\"\n\n\"The Lord have mercy on his soul,\" said Aunt Kate compassionately.\n\n\"Amen,\" said Gabriel. \"So the old gentleman, as I said, harnessed Johnny and put on his very best tall hat and his very best stock collar and drove out in grand style from his ancestral mansion somewhere near Back Lane, I think.\"\n\nEveryone laughed, even Mrs. Malins, at Gabriel's manner and Aunt Kate said:\n\n\"O, now, Gabriel, he didn't live in Back Lane, really. Only the mill was there.\"\n\n\"Out from the mansion of his forefathers,\" continued Gabriel, \"he drove with Johnny. And everything went on beautifully until Johnny came in sight of King Billy's statue: and whether he fell in love with the horse King Billy sits on or whether he thought he was back again in the mill, anyhow he began to walk round the statue.\"\n\nGabriel paced in a circle round the hall in his goloshes amid the laughter of the others.\n\n\"Round and round he went,\" said Gabriel, \"and the old gentleman, who was a very pompous old gentleman, was highly indignant. 'Go on, sir! What do you mean, sir? Johnny! Johnny! Most extraordinary conduct! Can't understand the horse!\"\n\nThe peal of laughter which followed Gabriel's imitation of the incident was interrupted by a resounding knock at the hall door. Mary Jane ran to open it and let in Freddy Malins. Freddy Malins, with his hat well back on his head and his shoulders humped with cold, was puffing and steaming after his exertions.\n\n\"I could only get one cab,\" he said.\n\n\"O, we'll find another along the quay,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Aunt Kate. \"Better not keep Mrs. Malins standing in the draught.\"\n\nMrs. Malins was helped down the front steps by her son and Mr. Browne and, after many manoeuvres, hoisted into the cab. Freddy Malins clambered in after her and spent a long time settling her on the seat, Mr. Browne helping him with advice. At last she was settled comfortably and Freddy Malins invited Mr. Browne into the cab. There was a good deal of confused talk, and then Mr. Browne got into the cab. The cabman settled his rug over his knees, and bent down for the address. The confusion grew greater and the cabman was directed differently by Freddy Malins and Mr. Browne, each of whom had his head out through a window of the cab. The difficulty was to know where to drop Mr. Browne along the route, and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane helped the discussion from the doorstep with cross-directions and contradictions and abundance of laughter. As for Freddy Malins he was speechless with laughter. He popped his head in and out of the window every moment to the great danger of his hat, and told his mother how the discussion was progressing, till at last Mr. Browne shouted to the bewildered cabman above the din of everybody's laughter:\n\n\"Do you know Trinity College?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the cabman.\n\n\"Well, drive bang up against Trinity College gates,\" said Mr. Browne, \"and then we'll tell you where to go. You understand now?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the cabman.\n\n\"Make like a bird for Trinity College.\"\n\n\"Right, sir,\" said the cabman.\n\nThe horse was whipped up and the cab rattled off along the quay amid a chorus of laughter and adieus.\n\nGabriel had not gone to the door with the others. He was in a dark part of the hall gazing up the staircase. A woman was standing near the top of the first flight, in the shadow also. He could not see her face but he could see the terra-cotta and salmon-pink panels of her skirt which the shadow made appear black and white. It was his wife. She was leaning on the banisters, listening to something. Gabriel was surprised at her stillness and strained his ear to listen also. But he could hear little save the noise of laughter and dispute on the front steps, a few chords struck on the piano and a few notes of a man's voice singing.\n\nHe stood still in the gloom of the hall, trying to catch the air that the voice was singing and gazing up at his wife. There was grace and mystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of something. He asked himself what is a woman standing on the stairs in the shadow, listening to distant music, a symbol of. If he were a painter he would paint her in that attitude. Her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her hair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt would show off the light ones. Distant Music he would call the picture if he were a painter.\n\nThe hall-door was closed; and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane came down the hall, still laughing.\n\n\"Well, isn't Freddy terrible?\" said Mary Jane. \"He's really terrible.\"\n\nGabriel said nothing but pointed up the stairs towards where his wife was standing. Now that the hall-door was closed the voice and the piano could be heard more clearly. Gabriel held up his hand for them to be silent. The song seemed to be in the old Irish tonality and the singer seemed uncertain both of his words and of his voice. The voice, made plaintive by distance and by the singer's hoarseness, faintly illuminated the cadence of the air with words expressing grief:\n\nO, the rain falls on my heavy locks\nAnd the dew wets my skin\nMy babe lies cold...\n\n\"O,\" exclaimed Mary Jane. \"It's Bartell D'Arcy singing and he wouldn't sing all the night. O, I'll get him to sing a song before he goes.\"\n\n\"O, do, Mary Jane,\" said Aunt Kate.\n\nMary Jane brushed past the others and ran to the staircase, but before she reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed abruptly.\n\n\"O, what a pity!\" she cried. \"Is he coming down, Gretta?\"\n\nGabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards them. A few steps behind her were Mr. Bartell D'Arcy and Miss O'Callaghan.\n\n\"O, Mr. D'Arcy,\" cried Mary Jane, \"it's downright mean of you to break off like that when we were all in raptures listening to you.\"\n\n\"I have been at him all the evening,\" said Miss O'Callaghan, \"and Mrs. Conroy, too, and he told us he had a dreadful cold and couldn't sing.\"\n\n\"O, Mr. D'Arcy,\" said Aunt Kate, \"now that was a great fib to tell.\"\n\n\"Can't you see that I'm as hoarse as a crow?\" said Mr. D'Arcy roughly\n\nHe went into the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat. The others, taken aback by his rude speech, could find nothing to say. Aunt Kate wrinkled her brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject. Mr. D'Arcy stood swathing his neck carefully and frowning.\n\n\"It's the weather,\" said Aunt Julia, after a pause.\n\n\"Yes, everybody has colds,\" said Aunt Kate readily, \"everybody.\"\n\n\"They say,\" said Mary Jane, \"we haven't had snow like it for thirty years; and I read this morning in the newspapers that the snow is general all over Ireland.\"\n\n\"I love the look of snow,\" said Aunt Julia sadly.\n\n\"So do I,\" said Miss O'Callaghan. \"I think Christmas is never really Christmas unless we have the snow on the ground.\"\n\n\"But poor Mr. D'Arcy doesn't like the snow,\" said Aunt Kate, smiling.\n\nMr. D'Arcy came from the pantry, fully swathed and buttoned, and in a repentant tone told them the history of his cold. Everyone gave him advice and said it was a great pity and urged him to be very careful of his throat in the night air. Gabriel watched his wife, who did not join in the conversation. She was standing right under the dusty fanlight and the flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair, which he had seen her drying at the fire a few days before. She was in the same attitude and seemed unaware of the talk about her At last she turned towards them and Gabriel saw that there was colour on her cheeks and that her eyes were shining. A sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his heart.\n\n\"Mr. D'Arcy,\" she said, \"what is the name of that song you were singing?\"\n\n\"It's called The Lass of Aughrim,\" said Mr. D'Arcy, \"but I couldn't remember it properly. Why? Do you know it?\"\n\n\"The Lass of Aughrim,\" she repeated. \"I couldn't think of the name.\"\n\n\"It's a very nice air,\" said Mary Jane. \"I'm sorry you were not in voice tonight.\"\n\n\"Now, Mary Jane,\" said Aunt Kate, \"don't annoy Mr. D'Arcy. I won't have him annoyed.\"\n\nSeeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the door, where good-night was said:\n\n\"Well, good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks for the pleasant evening.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Gabriel. Good-night, Gretta!\"\n\n\"Good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks ever so much. Goodnight, Aunt Julia.\"\n\n\"O, good-night, Gretta, I didn't see you.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Mr. D'Arcy. Good-night, Miss O'Callaghan.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Miss Morkan.\"\n\n\"Good-night, again.\"\n\n\"Good-night, all. Safe home.\"\n\n\"Good-night. Good night.\"\n\nThe morning was still dark. A dull, yellow light brooded over the houses and the river; and the sky seemed to be descending. It was slushy underfoot; and only streaks and patches of snow lay on the roofs, on the parapets of the quay and on the area railings. The lamps were still burning redly in the murky air and, across the river, the palace of the Four Courts stood out menacingly against the heavy sky.\n\nShe was walking on before him with Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, her shoes in a brown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands holding her skirt up from the slush. She had no longer any grace of attitude, but Gabriel's eyes were still bright with happiness. The blood went bounding along his veins; and the thoughts went rioting through his brain, proud, joyful, tender, valorous.\n\nShe was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he longed to run after her noiselessly, catch her by the shoulders and say something foolish and affectionate into her ear. She seemed to him so frail that he longed to defend her against something and then to be alone with her. Moments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory. A heliotrope envelope was lying beside his breakfast-cup and he was caressing it with his hand. Birds were twittering in the ivy and the sunny web of the curtain was shimmering along the floor: he could not eat for happiness. They were standing on the crowded platform and he was placing a ticket inside the warm palm of her glove. He was standing with her in the cold, looking in through a grated window at a man making bottles in a roaring furnace. It was very cold. Her face, fragrant in the cold air, was quite close to his; and suddenly he called out to the man at the furnace:\n\n\"Is the fire hot, sir?\"\n\nBut the man could not hear with the noise of the furnace. It was just as well. He might have answered rudely.\n\nA wave of yet more tender joy escaped from his heart and went coursing in warm flood along his arteries. Like the tender fire of stars moments of their life together, that no one knew of or would ever know of, broke upon and illumined his memory. He longed to recall to her those moments, to make her forget the years of their dull existence together and remember only their moments of ecstasy. For the years, he felt, had not quenched his soul or hers. Their children, his writing, her household cares had not quenched all their souls' tender fire. In one letter that he had written to her then he had said: \"Why is it that words like these seem to me so dull and cold? Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name?\"\n\nLike distant music these words that he had written years before were borne towards him from the past. He longed to be alone with her. When the others had gone away, when he and she were in the room in the hotel, then they would be alone together. He would call her softly:\n\n\"Gretta!\"\n\nPerhaps she would not hear at once: she would be undressing. Then something in his voice would strike her. She would turn and look at him....\n\nAt the corner of Winetavern Street they met a cab. He was glad of its rattling noise as it saved him from conversation. She was looking out of the window and seemed tired. The others spoke only a few words, pointing out some building or street. The horse galloped along wearily under the murky morning sky, dragging his old rattling box after his heels, and Gabriel was again in a cab with her, galloping to catch the boat, galloping to their honeymoon.\n\nAs the cab drove across O'Connell Bridge Miss O'Callaghan said:\n\n\"They say you never cross O'Connell Bridge without seeing a white horse.\"\n\n\"I see a white man this time,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"Where?\" asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy.\n\nGabriel pointed to the statue, on which lay patches of snow. Then he nodded familiarly to it and waved his hand.\n\n\"Good-night, Dan,\" he said gaily.\n\nWhen the cab drew up before the hotel, Gabriel jumped out and, in spite of Mr. Bartell D'Arcy's protest, paid the driver. He gave the man a shilling over his fare. The man saluted and said:\n\n\"A prosperous New Year to you, sir.\"\n\n\"The same to you,\" said Gabriel cordially.\n\nShe leaned for a moment on his arm in getting out of the cab and while standing at the curbstone, bidding the others good- night. She leaned lightly on his arm, as lightly as when she had danced with him a few hours before. He had felt proud and happy then, happy that she was his, proud of her grace and wifely carriage. But now, after the kindling again of so many memories, the first touch of her body, musical and strange and perfumed, sent through him a keen pang of lust. Under cover of her silence he pressed her arm closely to his side; and, as they stood at the hotel door, he felt that they had escaped from their lives and duties, escaped from home and friends and run away together with wild and radiant hearts to a new adventure.\n\nAn old man was dozing in a great hooded chair in the hall. He lit a candle in the office and went before them to the stairs. They followed him in silence, their feet falling in soft thuds on the thickly carpeted stairs. She mounted the stairs behind the porter, her head bowed in the ascent, her frail shoulders curved as with a burden, her skirt girt tightly about her. He could have flung his arms about her hips and held her still, for his arms were trembling with desire to seize her and only the stress of his nails against the palms of his hands held the wild impulse of his body in check. The porter halted on the stairs to settle his guttering candle. They halted, too, on the steps below him. In the silence Gabriel could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the thumping of his own heart against his ribs.\n\nThe porter led them along a corridor and opened a door. Then he set his unstable candle down on a toilet-table and asked at what hour they were to be called in the morning.\n\n\"Eight,\" said Gabriel.\n\nThe porter pointed to the tap of the electric-light and began a muttered apology, but Gabriel cut him short.\n\n\"We don't want any light. We have light enough from the street. And I say,\" he added, pointing to the candle, \"you might remove that handsome article, like a good man.\"\n\nThe porter took up his candle again, but slowly, for he was surprised by such a novel idea. Then he mumbled good-night and went out. Gabriel shot the lock to.\n\nA ghastly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window to the door. Gabriel threw his overcoat and hat on a couch and crossed the room towards the window. He looked down into the street in order that his emotion might calm a little. Then he turned and leaned against a chest of drawers with his back to the light. She had taken off her hat and cloak and was standing before a large swinging mirror, unhooking her waist. Gabriel paused for a few moments, watching her, and then said:\n\n\"Gretta!\"\n\nShe turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of light towards him. Her face looked so serious and weary that the words would not pass Gabriel's lips. No, it was not the moment yet.\n\n\"You looked tired,\" he said.\n\n\"I am a little,\" she answered.\n\n\"You don't feel ill or weak?\"\n\n\"No, tired: that's all.\"\n\nShe went on to the window and stood there, looking out. Gabriel waited again and then, fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him, he said abruptly:\n\n\"By the way, Gretta!\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"You know that poor fellow Malins?\" he said quickly.\n\n\"Yes. What about him?\"\n\n\"Well, poor fellow, he's a decent sort of chap, after all,\" continued Gabriel in a false voice. \"He gave me back that sovereign I lent him, and I didn't expect it, really. It's a pity he wouldn't keep away from that Browne, because he's not a bad fellow, really.\"\n\nHe was trembling now with annoyance. Why did she seem so abstracted? He did not know how he could begin. Was she annoyed, too, about something? If she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord! To take her as she was would be brutal. No, he must see some ardour in her eyes first. He longed to be master of her strange mood.\n\n\"When did you lend him the pound?\" she asked, after a pause.\n\nGabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal language about the sottish Malins and his pound. He longed to cry to her from his soul, to crush her body against his, to overmaster her. But he said:\n\n\"O, at Christmas, when he opened that little Christmas-card shop in Henry Street.\"\n\nHe was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come from the window. She stood before him for an instant, looking at him strangely. Then, suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her hands lightly on his shoulders, she kissed him.\n\n\"You are a very generous person, Gabriel,\" she said.\n\nGabriel, trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the quaintness of her phrase, put his hands on her hair and began smoothing it back, scarcely touching it with his fingers. The washing had made it fine and brilliant. His heart was brimming over with happiness. Just when he was wishing for it she had come to him of her own accord. Perhaps her thoughts had been running with his. Perhaps she had felt the impetuous desire that was in him, and then the yielding mood had come upon her. Now that she had fallen to him so easily, he wondered why he had been so diffident.\n\nHe stood, holding her head between his hands. Then, slipping one arm swiftly about her body and drawing her towards him, he said softly:\n\n\"Gretta, dear, what are you thinking about?\"\n\nShe did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm. He said again, softly:\n\n\"Tell me what it is, Gretta. I think I know what is the matter. Do I know?\"\n\nShe did not answer at once. Then she said in an outburst of tears:\n\n\"O, I am thinking about that song, The Lass of Aughrim.\"\n\nShe broke loose from him and ran to the bed and, throwing her arms across the bed-rail, hid her face. Gabriel stood stockstill for a moment in astonishment and then followed her. As he passed in the way of the cheval-glass he caught sight of himself in full length, his broad, well-filled shirt-front, the face whose expression always puzzled him when he saw it in a mirror, and his glimmering gilt-rimmed eyeglasses. He halted a few paces from her and said:\n\n\"What about the song? Why does that make you cry?\"\n\nShe raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the back of her hand like a child. A kinder note than he had intended went into his voice.\n\n\"Why, Gretta?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song.\"\n\n\"And who was the person long ago?\" asked Gabriel, smiling.\n\n\"It was a person I used to know in Galway when I was living with my grandmother,\" she said.\n\nThe smile passed away from Gabriel's face. A dull anger began to gather again at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust began to glow angrily in his veins.\n\n\"Someone you were in love with?\" he asked ironically.\n\n\"It was a young boy I used to know,\" she answered, \"named Michael Furey. He used to sing that song, The Lass of Aughrim. He was very delicate.\"\n\nGabriel was silent. He did not wish her to think that he was interested in this delicate boy.\n\n\"I can see him so plainly,\" she said, after a moment. \"Such eyes as he had: big, dark eyes! And such an expression in them -- an expression!\"\n\n\"O, then, you are in love with him?\" said Gabriel.\n\"I used to go out walking with him,\" she said, \"when I was in Galway.\"\n\nA thought flew across Gabriel's mind.\n\n\"Perhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?\" he said coldly.\n\nShe looked at him and asked in surprise:\n\n\"What for?\"\n\nHer eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders and said:\n\n\"How do I know? To see him, perhaps.\"\n\nShe looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence.\n\n\"He is dead,\" she said at length. \"He died when he was only seventeen. Isn't it a terrible thing to die so young as that?\"\n\n\"What was he?\" asked Gabriel, still ironically.\n\n\"He was in the gasworks,\" she said.\n\nGabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks. While he had been full of memories of their secret life together, full of tenderness and joy and desire, she had been comparing him in her mind with another. A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him. He saw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his own clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror. Instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead.\n\nHe tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent.\n\n\"I suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,\" he said.\n\n\"I was great with him at that time,\" she said.\n\nHer voice was veiled and sad. Gabriel, feeling now how vain it would be to try to lead her whither he had purposed, caressed one of her hands and said, also sadly:\n\n\"And what did he die of so young, Gretta? Consumption, was it?\"\n\n\"I think he died for me,\" she answered.\n\nA vague terror seized Gabriel at this answer, as if, at that hour when he had hoped to triumph, some impalpable and vindictive being was coming against him, gathering forces against him in its vague world. But he shook himself free of it with an effort of reason and continued to caress her hand. He did not question her again, for he felt that she would tell him of herself. Her hand was warm and moist: it did not respond to his touch, but he continued to caress it just as he had caressed her first letter to him that spring morning.\n\n\"It was in the winter,\" she said, \"about the beginning of the winter when I was going to leave my grandmother's and come up here to the convent. And he was ill at the time in his lodgings in Galway and wouldn't be let out, and his people in Oughterard were written to. He was in decline, they said, or something like that. I never knew rightly.\"\n\nShe paused for a moment and sighed.\n\n\"Poor fellow,\" she said. \"He was very fond of me and he was such a gentle boy. We used to go out together, walking, you know, Gabriel, like the way they do in the country. He was going to study singing only for his health. He had a very good voice, poor Michael Furey.\"\n\n\"Well; and then?\" asked Gabriel.\n\n\"And then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and I wouldn't be let see him so I wrote him a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the summer, and hoping he would be better then.\"\n\nShe paused for a moment to get her voice under control, and then went on:\n\n\"Then the night before I left, I was in my grandmother's house in Nuns' Island, packing up, and I heard gravel thrown up against the window. The window was so wet I couldn't see, so I ran downstairs as I was and slipped out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden, shivering.\"\n\n\"And did you not tell him to go back?\" asked Gabriel.\n\n\"I implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his death in the rain. But he said he did not want to live. I can see his eyes as well as well! He was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree.\"\n\n\"And did he go home?\" asked Gabriel.\n\n\"Yes, he went home. And when I was only a week in the convent he died and he was buried in Oughterard, where his people came from. O, the day I heard that, that he was dead!\"\n\nShe stopped, choking with sobs, and, overcome by emotion, flung herself face downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt. Gabriel held her hand for a moment longer, irresolutely, and then, shy of intruding on her grief, let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window.\n\nShe was fast asleep.\n\nGabriel, leaning on his elbow, looked for a few moments unresentfully on her tangled hair and half-open mouth, listening to her deep-drawn breath. So she had had that romance in her life: a man had died for her sake. It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life. He watched her while she slept, as though he and she had never lived together as man and wife. His curious eyes rested long upon her face and on her hair: and, as he thought of what she must have been then, in that time of her first girlish beauty, a strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul. He did not like to say even to himself that her face was no longer beautiful, but he knew that it was no longer the face for which Michael Furey had braved death.\nPerhaps she had not told him all the story. His eyes moved to the chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes. A petticoat string dangled to the floor. One boot stood upright, its limp upper fallen down: the fellow of it lay upon its side. He wondered at his riot of emotions of an hour before. From what had it proceeded? From his aunt's supper, from his own foolish speech, from the wine and dancing, the merry-making when saying good-night in the hall, the pleasure of the walk along the river in the snow. Poor Aunt Julia! She, too, would soon be a shade with the shade of Patrick Morkan and his horse. He had caught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing Arrayed for the Bridal. Soon, perhaps, he would be sitting in that same drawing-room, dressed in black, his silk hat on his knees. The blinds would be drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside him, crying and blowing her nose and telling him how Julia had died. He would cast about in his mind for some words that might console her, and would find only lame and useless ones. Yes, yes: that would happen very soon.\n\nThe air of the room chilled his shoulders. He stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife. One by one, they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age. He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so many years that image of her lover's eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to live.\nGenerous tears filled Gabriel's eyes. He had never felt like that himself towards any woman, but he knew that such a feeling must be love. The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree. Other forms were near. His soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead. He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence. His own identity was fading out into a grey impalpable world: the solid world itself, which these dead had one time reared and lived in, was dissolving and dwindling.\n\nA few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.24Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/907553", "artist_names": "Boz Scaggs", "full_title": "What Can I Say by\u00a0Boz\u00a0Scaggs", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/fd8dab278a091b1963dd1e5f19a97671.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fd8dab278a091b1963dd1e5f19a97671.640x640x1.jpg", "id": 907553, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1438620498, "path": "/Boz-scaggs-what-can-i-say-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Boz-scaggs-what-can-i-say-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1976, "month": 2, "day": 18}, "release_date_for_display": "February 18, 1976", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 18, 1976", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/fd8dab278a091b1963dd1e5f19a97671.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fd8dab278a091b1963dd1e5f19a97671.640x640x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "What Can I Say", "title_with_featured": "What Can I Say", "updated_by_human_at": 1642535452, "url": "https://genius.com/Boz-scaggs-what-can-i-say-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/222679", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3ff9de71010a335fad86760f4bb7624e.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 222679, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3ff9de71010a335fad86760f4bb7624e.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "b", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Boz Scaggs", "slug": "Boz-scaggs", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Boz-scaggs"}, "artist": "Boz Scaggs", "lyrics": "What Can I Say Lyrics(What can I say?)\n(What can I do?)\n\n3 AM, it's me again, wouldn't you know?\nThings would have to end this way\nI did my best the perfect guest knew when to go\nPerfect you knew when to stay\n\nCome on, tell me that you love me, dear\nI've been feeling down some too\nAfter all, it's time I made it clear\nI've been waiting just for you\n(What can I say?)

(With Your Baby) Lyrics(Wolfman)\nAhhh, do you remember the first time you started to date\nAnd the places you had to go just to be alone with your number one?\nWell, I hope this song brings back a whole lot of beautiful memories\nFor you\n\n(Flash)\nDid you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show\nAnd did you boogie there cause you had nowhere else that you could go\nAnd when the lights went way down low\nDid you forget about the picture show\nYes, did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show\nHey, little girl was it so long ago\nWe'd take a walk just to be alone\nAnd hey little girl if it should rain or snow\nRemember where we would go\n\nDid you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show\nAnd did you boogie there cause you had nowhere else that you could go\nAnd when the lights went way down low\nDid you forget about the picture show\nYes, did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show\n\n(Wolfman)\nSometimes I get to thinkin' there's not enough love and\nRomance left in our lives today. And that's why I'd like to\nReminisce and to relive that first feeling of love and do it all over\nAgain\n\n(Flash)\nHey little girl why not come over here\nAnd set beside me and make believe\nAnd say, little girl, why not stay over here\nWe'll have a party for two\n\nDid you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie show\nAnd did you boogie there cause you had nowhere else that you could go\nAnd when the lights went way down low\nDid you forget about the picture show\nYes, did you boogie with your baby in the back row of the movie showYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type":

hardly wait\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe way she moves, ooh-ooh-ooh, I gotta say\n[Chorus]\nLorelei, let's live together\nBrighter than the stars, forever\nLorelei, let's live together\nBrighter than the

at night, a big, old house gets lonely\nI guess every form of refuge has it's price\nAnd it breaks her heart to think her love is only\nGiven to a man with hands as cold as ice\n[Verse 3]\nSo she tells him she must go out for the evening\nTo comfort an old friend who's feelin' down\nBut he knows where she's goin' as she's leavin'\nShe is headed for the cheatin' side of town\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can't hide your lyin' eyes\nAnd your smile is a thin disguise\nI thought by now you'd realize\nThere ain't no way to hide your lyin' eyes\n\n[Verse 4]\nOn the other side of town, a boy is waiting\nWith fiery eyes and dreams no one could steal\nShe drives on through the night, anticipating\nBecause he makes her feel the way she used to feel\n\n[Verse 5]\nShe rushes to his arms, they fall together\nShe whispers that it's only for a while\nShe swears that, soon, she'll be comin' back forever\nShe pulls away and leaves him with a smile\n\n[Chorus]\nYou can't hide your lyin'

got this crazy\nShe thinks about a boy she knew in school\nDid she get tired or did she just get lazy?\nShe's so far gone, she feels just like a fool\n\n[Verse 8]\nMy, oh my, you sure know how to

That would never fly at the college, but taking the entire day of Halloween and playing themed music?\n\nThe idea grew, and suddenly I had pulled song after song for a playlist. It was about an eight hour loop, with about an extra hour to make sure Thriller play enough times to satisfy everyone. I did always choose the most well-known version of a song. Some times, I chose an interesting cover version.\n\nMy personal project was to hunt down as many versions as possible of the Donovan song Season of the Witch. That's the first part of my list.\n\nHere, then, is the A to Z portion of my Halloween Playlist, sans the Donovan song:\n(A * after the song indicates a later addition)\n\n\nA to Z\n30 Rock - Werewolf Bar Mitzvah\nAl WIlson - The Snake\nAlex Cooper - Welcome to My Nightmare\nAlison Krauss - Ghost In This House\nAll American Rejects - Jack's Lament\nAmanda Palmer & The Grand Theft Orchestra - Polly\nAngelo Badalamenti - Falling (Twin Peaks)\nAngelo Badalamenti - Laura Palmer's Theme\nApocolyptica - Hall of the Mountain King\nArthur Sullivan and W.S.

Casey Lyrics505 U.S. 833 (1992)\nNo. 91-744.\nArgued April 22, 1992.\nDecided June 29, 1992.[*]Justice O'Connor, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Souter announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, III, VA, VC, and VI, an opinion with respect to Part VE, in which Justice Stevens joins, and an opinion with respect to Parts IV, VB, and VD.ILiberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt. Yet 19 years after our holding that the Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy in its early stages, Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), that definition of liberty is still questioned. Joining the respondents as amicus curiae,  the United States, as it has done in five other cases in the last decade, again asks us to overrule Roe. See Brief for Respondents 104-117; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 8.\n\nAt issue in these cases are five provisions of the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act of 1982, as amended in 1988 and 1989. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3203-3220 (1990). Relevant portions of the Act are set forth in the Appendix. Infra, at 902. The Act requires that a woman seeking an abortion give her informed consent prior to the abortion procedure, and specifies that she be provided with certain information at least 24 hours before the abortion is performed.  3205. For a minor to obtain an abortion, the Act requires the informed consent of one of her parents, but provides for a judicial bypass option if the minor does not wish to or cannot obtain a parent's consent.  3206. Another provision of the Act requires that, unless certain exceptions apply, a married woman seeking an abortion must sign a statement indicating that she has notified her husband of her intended abortion.  3209. The Act exempts compliance with these three requirements in the event of a \"medical emergency,\" which is defined in  3203 of the Act. See  3203, 3205(a), 3206(a), 3209(c). In addition to the above provisions regulating the performance of abortions, the Act imposes certain reporting requirements on facilities that provide abortion services.  3207(b), 3214(a), 3214(f).\n\nBefore any of these provisions took effect, the petitioners, who are five abortion clinics and one physician representing himself as well as a class of physicians who provide abortion services, brought this suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Each provision was challenged as unconstitutional on its face. The District Court entered a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of the regulations, and, after a 3-day bench trial, held all the provisions at issue here unconstitutional, entering a permanent injunction against Pennsylvania's enforcement of them. 744 F. Supp. 1323 (ED Pa. 1990). The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part, upholding all of the regulations except for the husband notification requirement. 947 F. 2d 682 (1991). We granted certiorari. 502 U. S. 1056 (1992).\n\nThe Court of Appeals found it necessary to follow an elaborate course of reasoning even to identify the first premise to use to determine whether the statute enacted by Pennsylvania meets constitutional standards. See 947 F. 2d, at 687 698. And at oral argument in this Court, the attorney for the parties challenging the statute took the position that none of the enactments can be upheld without overruling Roe v. Wade. Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-6. We disagree with that analysis; but we acknowledge that our decisions after Roe  cast doubt upon the meaning and reach of its holding. Further, The Chief Justice admits that he would overrule the central holding ofRoe and adopt the rational relationship test as the sole criterion of constitutionality. See post, at 944, 966. State and federal courts as well as legislatures throughout the Union must have guidance as they seek to address this subject in conformance with the Constitution. Given these premises, we find it imperative to review once more the principles that define the rights of the woman and the legitimate authority of the State respecting the termination of pregnancies by abortion procedures.\nAfter considering the fundamental constitutional questions resolved by Roe, principles of institutional integrity, and the rule of stare decisis, we are led to conclude this: the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed.\n\nIt must be stated at the outset and with clarity that Roe `s essential holding, the holding we reaffirm, has three parts. First is a recognition of the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State. Before viability, the State's interests are not strong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or the imposition of a substantial obstacle to the woman's effective right to elect the procedure. Second is a confirmation of the State's power to restrict abortions after fetal viability, if the law contains exceptions for pregnancies which endanger the woman's life or health. And third is the principle that the State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child. These principles do not contradict one another; and we adhere to each.IIConstitutional protection of the woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy derives from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It declares that no State shall \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" The controlling word in the cases before us is \"liberty.\" Although a literal reading of the Clause might suggest that it governs only the procedures by which a State may deprive persons of liberty, for at least 105 years, since Mugler v. Kansas, 123 U. S. 623, 660-661 (1887), the Clause has been understood to contain a substantive component as well, one \"barring certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\" Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 331 (1986). As Justice Brandeis (joined by Justice Holmes) observed, \"[d]espite arguments to the contrary which had seemed to me persuasive, it is settled that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to matters of substantive law as well as to matters of procedure. Thus all fundamental rights comprised within the term liberty are protected by the Federal Constitution from invasion by the States.\" Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, 373 (1927) (concurring opinion). \"[T]he guaranties of due process, though having their roots in Magna Carta's `per legem terrae' and considered as procedural safeguards `against executive usurpation and tyranny,' have in this country `become bulwarks also against arbitrary legislation.' \" Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497, 541 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds) (quoting Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 532 (1884)).\n\nThe most familiar of the substantive liberties protected by the Fourteenth Amendment are those recognized by the Bill of Rights. We have held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates most of the Bill of Rights against the States. See, e. g., Duncan v. Louisiana,  391 U. S. 145, 147-148 (1968). It is tempting, as a means of curbing the discretion of federal judges, to suppose that liberty encompasses no more than those rights already guaranteed to the individual against federal interference by the express provisions of the first eight Amendments to the Constitution. See Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46, 68-92 (1947) (Black, J., dissenting). But of course this Court has never accepted that view.\n\nIt is also tempting, for the same reason, to suppose that the Due Process Clause protects only those practices, defined at the most specific level, that were protected against government interference by other rules of law when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. See Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, 127-128, n. 6 (1989) (opinion of Scalia, J.). But such a view would be inconsistent with our law. It is a promise of the Constitution that there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter. We have vindicated this principle before. Marriage is mentioned nowhere in the Bill of Rights and interracial marriage was illegal in most States in the 19th century, but the Court was no doubt correct in finding it to be an aspect of liberty protected against state interference by the substantive component of the Due Process Clause in Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 12 (1967) (relying, in an opinion for eight Justices, on the Due Process Clause). Similar examples may be found in Turner  v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 94-99 (1987); in Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S. 678, 684-686 (1977); in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, 481-482 (1965), as well as in the separate opinions of a majority of the Members of the Court in that case, id., at 486-488 (Goldberg, J., joined by Warren, C. J., and Brennan, J., concurring) (expressly relying on due process), id., at 500-502 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment) (same), id., at 502-507 (White, J., concurring in judgment) (same); in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510, 534-535 (1925); and in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, 399-403 (1923).\n\nNeither the Bill of Rights nor the specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment marks the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects. See U. S. Const., Amdt. 9. As the second Justice Harlan recognized:\"[T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This `liberty' is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints, . . . and which also recognizes, what a reasonable and sensitive judgment must, that certain interests require particularly careful scrutiny of the state needs asserted to justify their abridgment.\" Poe v. *849 Ullman, supra, at 543 (opinion dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds).Justice Harlan wrote these words in addressing an issue the full Court did not reach in Poe v. Ullman, but the Court adopted his position four Terms later in Griswold v. Connecticut, supra. In Griswold, we held that the Constitution does not permit a State to forbid a married couple to use contraceptives. That same freedom was later guaranteed, under the Equal Protection Clause, for unmarried couples. See Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972). Constitutional protection was extended to the sale and distribution of contraceptives in Carey v. Population Services International, supra. It is settled now, as it was when the Court heard arguments in Roe v. Wade, that the Constitution places limits on a State's right to interfere with a person's most basic decisions about family and parenthood, see Carey v. Population Services International, supra; Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977); Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra; Loving v. Virginia, supra; Griswold v. Connecticut, supra; Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942); Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra; Meyer v. Nebraska, supra, as well as bodily integrity, see, e. g., Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210, 221-222 (1990); Winston v. Lee, 470 U. S. 753 (1985); Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952).\n\nThe inescapable fact is that adjudication of substantive due process claims may call upon the Court in interpreting the Constitution to exercise that same capacity which by tradition courts always have exercised: reasoned judgment. Its boundaries are not susceptible of expression as a simple rule. That does not mean we are free to invalidate state policy choices with which we disagree; yet neither does it permit us to shrink from the duties of our office. As Justice Harlan observed:\"Due process has not been reduced to any formula; its content cannot be determined by reference to any code.*850 The best that can be said is that through the course of this Court's decisions it has represented the balance which our Nation, built upon postulates of respect for the liberty of the individual, has struck between that liberty and the demands of organized society. If the supplying of content to this Constitutional concept has of necessity been a rational process, it certainly has not been one where judges have felt free to roam where unguided speculation might take them. The balance of which I speak is the balance struck by this country, having regard to what history teaches are the traditions from which it developed as well as the traditions from which it broke. That tradition is a living thing. A decision of this Court which radically departs from it could not long survive, while a decision which builds on what has survived is likely to be sound. No formula could serve as a substitute, in this area, for judgment and restraint.\" Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S., at 542 (opinion dissenting from dismissal on jurisdictional grounds).See also Rochin v. California, supra, at 171-172 (Frankfurter, J., writing for the Court) (\"To believe that this judicial exercise of judgment could be avoided by freezing `due process of law' at some fixed stage of time or thought is to suggest that the most important aspect of constitutional adjudication is a function for inanimate machines and not for judges\").\n\nMen and women of good conscience can disagree, and we suppose some always shall disagree, about the profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy, even in its earliest stage. Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code. The underlying constitutional issue is whether the State can resolve these philosophic questions in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter, except perhaps *851 in those rare circumstances in which the pregnancy is itself a danger to her own life or health, or is the result of rape or incest.\n\nIt is conventional constitutional doctrine that where reasonable people disagree the government can adopt one position or the other. See, e. g., Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726 (1963); Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483 (1955). That theorem, however, assumes a state of affairs in which the choice does not intrude upon a protected liberty. Thus, while some people might disagree about whether or not the flag should be saluted, or disagree about the proposition that it may not be defiled, we have ruled that a State may not compel or enforce one view or the other. See West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943); Texas v. Johnson, 491 U. S. 397 (1989).\n\nOur law affords constitutional protection to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, child rearing, and education. Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S., at 685. Our cases recognize \"the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\" Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra, at 453 (emphasis in original). Our precedents \"have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.\" Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U. S. 158, 166 (1944). These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.\n\n*852 These considerations begin our analysis of the woman's interest in terminating her pregnancy but cannot end it, for this reason: though the abortion decision may originate within the zone of conscience and belief, it is more than a philosophic exercise. Abortion is a unique act. It is an act fraught with consequences for others: for the woman who must live with the implications of her decision; for the persons who perform and assist in the procedure; for the spouse, family, and society which must confront the knowledge that these procedures exist, procedures some deem nothing short of an act of violence against innocent human life; and, depending on one's beliefs, for the life or potential life that is aborted. Though abortion is conduct, it does not follow that the State is entitled to proscribe it in all instances. That is because the liberty of the woman is at stake in a sense unique to the human condition and so unique to the law. The mother who carries a child to full term is subject to anxieties, to physical constraints, to pain that only she must bear. That these sacrifices have from the beginning of the human race been endured by woman with a pride that ennobles her in the eyes of others and gives to the infant a bond of love cannot alone be grounds for the State to insist she make the sacrifice. Her suffering is too intimate and personal for the State to insist, without more, upon its own vision of the woman's role, however dominant that vision has been in the course of our history and our culture. The destiny of the woman must be shaped to a large extent on her own conception of her spiritual imperatives and her place in society.\n\nIt should be recognized, moreover, that in some critical respects the abortion decision is of the same character as the decision to use contraception, to which Griswold v. Connecticut, Eisenstadt v. Baird, and Carey v. Population Services International afford constitutional protection. We have no doubt as to the correctness of those decisions. They support *853 the reasoning in Roe relating to the woman's liberty because they involve personal decisions concerning not only the meaning of procreation but also human responsibility and respect for it. As with abortion, reasonable people will have differences of opinion about these matters. One view is based on such reverence for the wonder of creation that any pregnancy ought to be welcomed and carried to full term no matter how difficult it will be to provide for the child and ensure its well-being. Another is that the inability to provide for the nurture and care of the infant is a cruelty to the child and an anguish to the parent. These are intimate views with infinite variations, and their deep, personal character underlay our decisions in Griswold, Eisenstadt, and Carey. The same concerns are present when the woman confronts the reality that, perhaps despite her attempts to avoid it, she has become pregnant.\n\nIt was this dimension of personal liberty that Roe sought to protect, and its holding invoked the reasoning and the tradition of the precedents we have discussed, granting protection to substantive liberties of the person. Roe was, of course, an extension of those cases and, as the decision itself indicated, the separate States could act in some degree to further their own legitimate interests in protecting prenatal life. The extent to which the legislatures of the States might act to outweigh the interests of the woman in choosing to terminate her pregnancy was a subject of debate both in Roe itself and in decisions following it.\n\nWhile we appreciate the weight of the arguments made on behalf of the State in the cases before us, arguments which in their ultimate formulation conclude that Roe should be overruled, the reservations any of us may have in reaffirming the central holding of Roe are outweighed by the explication of individual liberty we have given combined with the force of stare decisis. We turn now to that doctrine.*854 IIIAThe obligation to follow precedent begins with necessity, and a contrary necessity marks its outer limit. With Cardozo, we recognize that no judicial system could do society's work if it eyed each issue afresh in every case that raised it. See B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921). Indeed, the very concept of the rule of law underlying our own Constitution requires such continuity over time that a respect for precedent is, by definition, indispensable. See Powell, Stare Decisis and Judicial Restraint, 1991 Journal of Supreme Court History 13, 16. At the other extreme, a different necessity would make itself felt if a prior judicial ruling should come to be seen so clearly as error that its enforcement was for that very reason doomed.\nEven when the decision to overrule a prior case is not, as in the rare, latter instance, virtually foreordained, it is common wisdom that the rule of stare decisis is not an \"inexorable command,\" and certainly it is not such in every constitutional case, see Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 405-411 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). See also Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 842 (1991) (Souter, J., joined by Kennedy, J., concurring); Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984). Rather, when this Court reexamines a prior holding, its judgment is customarily informed by a series of prudential and pragmatic considerations designed to test the consistency of overruling a prior decision with the ideal of the rule of law, and to gauge the respective costs of reaffirming and overruling a prior case. Thus, for example, we may ask whether the rule has proven to be intolerable simply in defying practical workability, Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965); whether the rule is subject to a kind of reliance that would lend a special hardship to the consequences of overruling and add inequity to the cost of repudiation, e. g., United States v. Title Ins. & Trust *855 Co., 265 U. S. 472, 486 (1924); whether related principles of law have so far developed as to have left the old rule no more than a remnant of abandoned doctrine, see Patterson  v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173-174 (1989); or whether facts have so changed, or come to be seen so differently, as to have robbed the old rule of significant application or justification, e. g., Burnet, supra, at 412 (Brandeis, J., dissenting).\n\nSo in this case we may enquire whether Roe `s central rule has been found unworkable; whether the rule's limitation on state power could be removed without serious inequity to those who have relied upon it or significant damage to the stability of the society governed by it; whether the law's growth in the intervening years has left Roe's central rule a doctrinal anachronism discounted by society; and whether Roe `s premises of fact have so far changed in the ensuing two decades as to render its central holding somehow irrelevant or unjustifiable in dealing with the issue it addressed.1Although Roe has engendered opposition, it has in no sense proven \"unworkable,\" see Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 546 (1985), representing as it does a simple limitation beyond which a state law is unenforceable. While Roe has, of course, required judicial assessment of state laws affecting the exercise of the choice guaranteed against government infringement, and although the need for such review will remain as a consequence of today's decision, the required determinations fall within judicial competence.2The inquiry into reliance counts the cost of a rule's repudiation as it would fall on those who have relied reasonably on the rule's continued application. Since the classic case for weighing reliance heavily in favor of following the earlier rule occurs in the commercial context, see Payne v. Tennes- *856 see, supra, at 828, where advance planning of great precision is most obviously a necessity, it is no cause for surprise that some would find no reliance worthy of consideration in support of Roe.\n\nWhile neither respondents nor their amici in so many words deny that the abortion right invites some reliance prior to its actual exercise, one can readily imagine an argument stressing the dissimilarity of this case to one involving property or contract. Abortion is customarily chosen as an unplanned response to the consequence of unplanned activity or to the failure of conventional birth control, and except on the assumption that no intercourse would have occurred but for Roe `s holding, such behavior may appear to justify no reliance claim. Even if reliance could be claimed on that unrealistic assumption, the argument might run, any reliance interest would be de minimis. This argument would be premised on the hypothesis that reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.\n\nTo eliminate the issue of reliance that easily, however, one would need to limit cognizable reliance to specific instances of sexual activity. But to do this would be simply to refuse to face the fact that for two decades of economic and social developments, people have organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail. The ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. See, e. g., R. Petchesky, Abortion and Woman's Choice 109, 133, n. 7 (rev. ed. 1990). The Constitution serves human values, and while the effect of reliance on Roe cannot be exactly measured, neither can the certain cost of overruling Roe for people who have ordered their thinking and living around that case be dismissed.\n\n*857 3No evolution of legal principle has left Roe `s doctrinal footings weaker than they were in 1973. No development of constitutional law since the case was decided has implicitly or explicitly left Roe behind as a mere survivor of obsolete constitutional thinking.\n\nIt will be recognized, of course, that Roe stands at an intersection of two lines of decisions, but in whichever doctrinal category one reads the case, the result for present purposes will be the same. The Roe Court itself placed its holding in the succession of cases most prominently exemplified by Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965). See Roe, 410 U. S., at 152-153. When it is so seen, Roe is clearly in no jeopardy, since subsequent constitutional developments have neither disturbed, nor do they threaten to diminish, the scope of recognized protection accorded to the liberty relating to intimate relationships, the family, and decisions about whether or not to beget or bear a child. See, e. g., Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S. 678 (1977); Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977).\n\nRoe, however, may be seen not only as an exemplar of Griswold liberty but as a rule (whether or not mistaken) of personal autonomy and bodily integrity, with doctrinal affinity to cases recognizing limits on governmental power to mandate medical treatment or to bar its rejection. If so, our cases since Roe accord with Roe `s view that a State's interest in the protection of life falls short of justifying any plenary override of individual liberty claims. Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 278 (1990); cf., e. g., Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U. S. 127, 135 (1992); Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210 (1990); see also, e. g., Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952); Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11, 24-30 (1905).\n\nFinally, one could classify Roe as sui generis. If the case is so viewed, then there clearly has been no erosion of its central determination. The original holding resting on the *858 concurrence of seven Members of the Court in 1973 was expressly affirmed by a majority of six in 1983, see Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (Akron I), and by a majority of five in 1986, see Thornburgh  v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,  476 U. S. 747, expressing adherence to the constitutional ruling despite legislative efforts in some States to test its limits. More recently, in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490 (1989), although two of the present authors questioned the trimester framework in a way consistent with our judgment today, see id., at 518 (Rehnquist, C. J., joined by White and Kennedy, JJ.); id., at 529 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a majority of the Court either decided to reaffirm or declined to address the constitutional validity of the central holding of Roe. See Webster, 492 U. S., at 521 (Rehnquist, C. J., joined by White and Kennedy, JJ.); id., at 525-526 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at 537, 553 (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part); id., at 561-563 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\nNor will courts building upon Roe be likely to hand down erroneous decisions as a consequence. Even on the assumption that the central holding of Roe was in error, that error would go only to the strength of the state interest in fetal protection, not to the recognition afforded by the Constitution to the woman's liberty. The latter aspect of the decision fits comfortably within the framework of the Court's prior decisions, including Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942); Griswold, supra; Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); and Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972), the holdings of which are \"not a series of isolated points,\" but mark a \"rational continuum.\" Poe v. Ullman,  367 U. S., at 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting). As we described in *859 Carey v. Population Services International, supra, the liberty which encompasses those decisions\"includes `the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.' While the outer limits of this aspect of [protected liberty] have not been marked by the Court, it is clear that among the decisions that an individual may make without unjustified government interference are personal decisions `relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education.' \" 431 U. S., at 684-685 (citations omitted).The soundness of this prong of the Roe analysis is apparent from a consideration of the alternative. If indeed the woman's interest in deciding whether to bear and beget a child had not been recognized as in Roe, the State might as readily restrict a woman's right to choose to carry a pregnancy to term as to terminate it, to further asserted state interests in population control, or eugenics, for example. Yet Roe has been sensibly relied upon to counter any such suggestions. E. g., Arnold v. Board of Education of Escambia County, Ala., 880 F. 2d 305, 311 (CA11 1989) (relying upon Roe and concluding that government officials violate the Constitution by coercing a minor to have an abortion); Avery v. County of Burke, 660 F. 2d 111, 115 (CA4 1981) (county agency inducing teenage girl to undergo unwanted sterilization on the basis of misrepresentation that she had sickle cell trait); see also In re Quinlan, 70 N. J. 10, 355 A. 2d 647 (relying on Roe in finding a right to terminate medical treatment), cert. denied sub nom. Garger v. New Jersey, 429 U. S. 922 (1976)). In any event, because Roe `s scope is confined by the fact of its concern with postconception potential life, a concern otherwise likely to be implicated only by some forms of contraception protected independently under Griswold and later cases, any error in Roe is unlikely to have serious ramifications in future cases.\n*8604We have seen how time has overtaken some of Roe `s factual assumptions: advances in maternal health care allow for abortions safe to the mother later in pregnancy than was true in 1973, see Akron I, supra, at 429, n. 11, and advances in neonatal care have advanced viability to a point somewhat earlier. Compare Roe, 410 U. S., at 160, with Webster, supra, at 515-516 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.); see Akron I, 462 U. S., at 457, and n. 5 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). But these facts go only to the scheme of time limits on the realization of competing interests, and the divergences from the factual premises of 1973 have no bearing on the validity of Roe `s central holding, that viability marks the earliest point at which the State's interest in fetal life is constitutionally adequate to justify a legislative ban on nontherapeutic abortions. The soundness or unsoundness of that constitutional judgment in no sense turns on whether viability occurs at approximately 28 weeks, as was usual at the time of Roe, at 23 to 24 weeks, as it sometimes does today, or at some moment even slightly earlier in pregnancy, as it may if fetal respiratory capacity can somehow be enhanced in the future. Whenever it may occur, the attainment of viability may continue to serve as the critical fact, just as it has done since Roe was decided; which is to say that no change in Roe `s factual underpinning has left its central holding obsolete, and none supports an argument for overruling it.5The sum of the precedential enquiry to this point shows Roe `s underpinnings unweakened in any way affecting its central holding. While it has engendered disapproval, it has not been unworkable. An entire generation has come of age free to assume Roe `s concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions; no erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left Roe `s central holding a doctrinal remnant; *861 Roe portends no developments at odds with other precedent for the analysis of personal liberty; and no changes of fact have rendered viability more or less appropriate as the point at which the balance of interests tips. Within the bounds of normal stare decisis analysis, then, and subject to the considerations on which it customarily turns, the stronger argument is for affirming Roe `s central holding, with whatever degree of personal reluctance any of us may have, not for overruling it.BIn a less significant case, stare decisis analysis could, and would, stop at the point we have reached. But the sustained and widespread debate Roe has provoked calls for some comparison between that case and others of comparable dimension that have responded to national controversies and taken on the impress of the controversies addressed. Only two such decisional lines from the past century present themselves for examination, and in each instance the result reached by the Court accorded with the principles we apply today.\n\nThe first example is that line of cases identified with Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), which imposed substantive limitations on legislation limiting economic autonomy in favor of health and welfare regulation, adopting, in Justice Holmes's view, the theory of laissez-faire. Id., at 75 (dissenting opinion). The Lochner decisions were exemplified by Adkins v. Children's Hospital of District of Columbia, 261 U. S. 525 (1923), in which this Court held it to be an infringement of constitutionally protected liberty of contract to require the employers of adult women to satisfy minimum wage standards. Fourteen years later, West Coast Hotel Co.  v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937), signaled the demise of Lochner by overruling Adkins. In the meantime, the Depression had come and, with it, the lesson that seemed unmistakable to most people by 1937, that the interpretation of contractual freedom protected in Adkins rested on fundamentally *862 false factual assumptions about the capacity of a relatively unregulated market to satisfy minimal levels of human welfare. See West Coast Hotel Co., supra, at 399. As Justice Jackson wrote of the constitutional crisis of 1937 shortly before he came on the bench: \"The older world of laissez faire was recognized everywhere outside the Court to be dead.\" The Struggle for Judicial Supremacy 85 (1941). The facts upon which the earlier case had premised a constitutional resolution of social controversy had proven to be untrue, and history's demonstration of their untruth not only justified but required the new choice of constitutional principle that West Coast Hotel announced. Of course, it was true that the Court lost something by its misperception, or its lack of prescience, and the Court-packing crisis only magnified the loss; but the clear demonstration that the facts of economic life were different from those previously assumed warranted the repudiation of the old law.\n\nThe second comparison that 20th century history invites is with the cases employing the separate-but-equal rule for applying the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection guarantee. They began with Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), holding that legislatively mandated racial segregation in public transportation works no denial of equal protection, rejecting the argument that racial separation enforced by the legal machinery of American society treats the black race as inferior. The Plessy Court considered \"the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff's argument to consist in the assumption that the enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race chooses to put that construction upon it.\" Id., at 551. Whether, as a matter of historical fact, the Justices in the Plessy majority believed this or not, see id., at 557, 562 (Harlan, J., dissenting), this understanding of the implication of segregation was the stated justification for the Court's opinion. But this understanding of *863 the facts and the rule it was stated to justify were repudiated in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954) (Brown I). As one commentator observed, the question before the Court in Brown was \"whether discrimination inheres in that segregation which is imposed by law in the twentieth century in certain specific states in the American Union. And that question has meaning and can find an answer only on the ground of history and of common knowledge about the facts of life in the times and places aforesaid.\" Black, The Lawfulness of the Segregation Decisions, 69 Yale L. J. 421, 427 (1960).\n\nThe Court in Brown addressed these facts of life by observing that whatever may have been the understanding in Plessy `s time of the power of segregation to stigmatize those who were segregated with a \"badge of inferiority,\" it was clear by 1954 that legally sanctioned segregation had just such an effect, to the point that racially separate public educational facilities were deemed inherently unequal. 347 U. S., at 494-495. Society's understanding of the facts upon which a constitutional ruling was sought in 1954 was thus fundamentally different from the basis claimed for the decision in 1896. While we think Plessy was wrong the day it was decided, see Plessy, supra, at 552-564 (Harlan, J., dissenting), we must also recognize that the Plessy Court's explanation for its decision was so clearly at odds with the facts apparent to the Court in 1954 that the decision to reexamine Plessy was on this ground alone not only justified but required.\n\nWest Coast Hotel and Brown each rested on facts, or an understanding of facts, changed from those which furnished the claimed justifications for the earlier constitutional resolutions. Each case was comprehensible as the Court's response to facts that the country could understand, or had come to understand already, but which the Court of an earlier day, as its own declarations disclosed, had not been able to perceive. As the decisions were thus comprehensible *864 they were also defensible, not merely as the victories of one doctrinal school over another by dint of numbers (victories though they were), but as applications of constitutional principle to facts as they had not been seen by the Court before. In constitutional adjudication as elsewhere in life, changed circumstances may impose new obligations, and the thoughtful part of the Nation could accept each decision to overrule a prior case as a response to the Court's constitutional duty.\nBecause the cases before us present no such occasion it could be seen as no such response. Because neither the factual underpinnings of Roe `s central holding nor our understanding of it has changed (and because no other indication of weakened precedent has been shown), the Court could not pretend to be reexamining the prior law with any justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently from the Court of 1973. To overrule prior law for no other reason than that would run counter to the view repeated in our cases, that a decision to overrule should rest on some special reason over and above the belief that a prior case was wrongly decided. See, e. g., Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., 416 U. S. 600, 636 (1974) (Stewart, J., dissenting) (\"A basic change in the law upon a ground no firmer than a change in our membership invites the popular misconception that this institution is little different from the two political branches of the Government. No misconception could do more lasting injury to this Court and to the system of law which it is our abiding mission to serve\"); Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, 677 (1961) (Harlan, J., dissenting).CThe examination of the conditions justifying the repudiation of Adkins by West Coast Hotel and Plessy by Brown is enough to suggest the terrible price that would have been paid if the Court had not overruled as it did. In the present cases, however, as our analysis to this point makes clear, the terrible price would be paid for overruling. Our analysis *865 would not be complete, however, without explaining why overruling Roe `s central holding would not only reach an unjustifiable result under principles of stare decisis, but would seriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated to the rule of law. To understand why this would be so it is necessary to understand the source of this Court's authority, the conditions necessary for its preservation, and its relationship to the country's understanding of itself as a constitutional Republic.\n\nThe root of American governmental power is revealed most clearly in the instance of the power conferred by the Constitution upon the Judiciary of the United States and specifically upon this Court. As Americans of each succeeding generation are rightly told, the Court cannot buy support for its decisions by spending money and, except to a minor degree, it cannot independently coerce obedience to its decrees. The Court's power lies, rather, in its legitimacy, a product of substance and perception that shows itself in the people's acceptance of the Judiciary as fit to determine what the Nation's law means and to declare what it demands.\n\nThe underlying substance of this legitimacy is of course the warrant for the Court's decisions in the Constitution and the lesser sources of legal principle on which the Court draws. That substance is expressed in the Court's opinions, and our contemporary understanding is such that a decision without principled justification would be no judicial act at all. But even when justification is furnished by apposite legal principle, something more is required. Because not every conscientious claim of principled justification will be accepted as such, the justification claimed must be beyond dispute. The Court must take care to speak and act in ways that allow people to accept its decisions on the terms the Court claims for them, as grounded truly in principle, not as compromises with social and political pressures having, as such, no bearing on the principled choices that the Court is *866 obliged to make. Thus, the Court's legitimacy depends on making legally principled decisions under circumstances in which their principled character is sufficiently plausible to be accepted by the Nation.\n\nThe need for principled action to be perceived as such is implicated to some degree whenever this, or any other appellate court, overrules a prior case. This is not to say, of course, that this Court cannot give a perfectly satisfactory explanation in most cases. People understand that some of the Constitution's language is hard to fathom and that the Court's Justices are sometimes able to perceive significant facts or to understand principles of law that eluded their predecessors and that justify departures from existing decisions. However upsetting it may be to those most directly affected when one judicially derived rule replaces another, the country can accept some correction of error without necessarily questioning the legitimacy of the Court.\n\nIn two circumstances, however, the Court would almost certainly fail to receive the benefit of the doubt in overruling prior cases. There is, first, a point beyond which frequent overruling would overtax the country's belief in the Court's good faith. Despite the variety of reasons that may inform and justify a decision to overrule, we cannot forget that such a decision is usually perceived (and perceived correctly) as, at the least, a statement that a prior decision was wrong. There is a limit to the amount of error that can plausibly be imputed to prior Courts. If that limit should be exceeded, disturbance of prior rulings would be taken as evidence that justifiable reexamination of principle had given way to drives for particular results in the short term. The legitimacy of the Court would fade with the frequency of its vacillation.\n\nThat first circumstance can be described as hypothetical; the second is to the point here and now. Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in such a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe and those rare, comparable cases, its *867 decision has a dimension that the resolution of the normal case does not carry. It is the dimension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.\n\nThe Court is not asked to do this very often, having thus addressed the Nation only twice in our lifetime, in the decisions of Brown and Roe. But when the Court does act in this way, its decision requires an equally rare precedential force to counter the inevitable efforts to overturn it and to thwart its implementation. Some of those efforts may be mere unprincipled emotional reactions; others may proceed from principles worthy of profound respect. But whatever the premises of opposition may be, only the most convincing justification under accepted standards of precedent could suffice to demonstrate that a later decision overruling the first was anything but a surrender to political pressure, and an unjustified repudiation of the principle on which the Court staked its authority in the first instance. So to overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to reexamine a watershed decision would subvert the Court's legitimacy beyond any serious question. Cf. Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 300 (1955) (Brown II)  (\"[I]t should go without saying that the vitality of th[e] constitutional principles [announced in Brown I, ] cannot be allowed to yield simply because of disagreement with them\").\n\nThe country's loss of confidence in the Judiciary would be underscored by an equally certain and equally reasonable condemnation for another failing in overruling unnecessarily and under pressure. Some cost will be paid by anyone who approves or implements a constitutional decision where it is unpopular, or who refuses to work to undermine the decision or to force its reversal. The price may be criticism or ostracism, or it may be violence. An extra price will be paid by those who themselves disapprove of the decision's results *868 when viewed outside of constitutional terms, but who nevertheless struggle to accept it, because they respect the rule of law. To all those who will be so tested by following, the Court implicitly undertakes to remain steadfast, lest in the end a price be paid for nothing. The promise of constancy, once given, binds its maker for as long as the power to stand by the decision survives and the understanding of the issue has not changed so fundamentally as to render the commitment obsolete. From the obligation of this promise this Court cannot and should not assume any exemption when duty requires it to decide a case in conformance with the Constitution. A willing breach of it would be nothing less than a breach of faith, and no Court that broke its faith with the people could sensibly expect credit for principle in the decision by which it did that.\n\nIt is true that diminished legitimacy may be restored, but only slowly. Unlike the political branches, a Court thus weakened could not seek to regain its position with a new mandate from the voters, and even if the Court could somehow go to the polls, the loss of its principled character could not be retrieved by the casting of so many votes. Like the character of an individual, the legitimacy of the Court must be earned over time. So, indeed, must be the character of a Nation of people who aspire to live according to the rule of law. Their belief in themselves as such a people is not readily separable from their understanding of the Court invested with the authority to decide their constitutional cases and speak before all others for their constitutional ideals. If the Court's legitimacy should be undermined, then, so would the country be in its very ability to see itself through its constitutional ideals. The Court's concern with legitimacy is not for the sake of the Court, but for the sake of the Nation to which it is responsible.\n\nThe Court's duty in the present cases is clear. In 1973, it confronted the already-divisive issue of governmental power *869 to limit personal choice to undergo abortion, for which it provided a new resolution based on the due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether or not a new social consensus is developing on that issue, its divisiveness is no less today than in 1973, and pressure to overrule the decision, like pressure to retain it, has grown only more intense. A decision to overrule Roe `s essential holding under the existing circumstances would address error, if error there was, at the cost of both profound and unnecessary damage to the Court's legitimacy, and to the Nation's commitment to the rule of law. It is therefore imperative to adhere to the essence of Roe `s original decision, and we do so today.IVFrom what we have said so far it follows that it is a constitutional liberty of the woman to have some freedom to terminate her pregnancy. We conclude that the basic decision in Roe was based on a constitutional analysis which we cannot now repudiate. The woman's liberty is not so unlimited, however, that from the outset the State cannot show its concern for the life of the unborn, and at a later point in fetal development the State's interest in life has sufficient force so that the right of the woman to terminate the pregnancy can be restricted.\n\nThat brings us, of course, to the point where much criticism has been directed at Roe, a criticism that always inheres when the Court draws a specific rule from what in the Constitution is but a general standard. We conclude, however, that the urgent claims of the woman to retain the ultimate control over her destiny and her body, claims implicit in the meaning of liberty, require us to perform that function. Liberty must not be extinguished for want of a line that is clear. And it falls to us to give some real substance to the woman's liberty to determine whether to carry her pregnancy to full term.\n\n*870 We conclude the line should be drawn at viability, so that before that time the woman has a right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. We adhere to this principle for two reasons. First, as we have said, is the doctrine of stare decisis. Any judicial act of line-drawing may seem somewhat arbitrary, but Roe was a reasoned statement, elaborated with great care. We have twice reaffirmed it in the face of great opposition. See Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 759; Akron I , 462 U. S., at 419-420. Although we must overrule those parts of Thornburgh and Akron I which, in our view, are inconsistent with Roe `s statement that the State has a legitimate interest in promoting the life or potential life of the unborn, see infra, at 882-883, the central premise of those cases represents an unbroken commitment by this Court to the essential holding of Roe. It is that premise which we reaffirm today.\n\nThe second reason is that the concept of viability, as we noted in Roe, is the time at which there is a realistic possibility of maintaining and nourishing a life outside the womb, so that the independent existence of the second life can in reason and all fairness be the object of state protection that now overrides the rights of the woman. See Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S., at 163. Consistent with other constitutional norms, legislatures may draw lines which appear arbitrary without the necessity of offering a justification. But courts may not. We must justify the lines we draw. And there is no line other than viability which is more workable. To be sure, as we have said, there may be some medical developments that affect the precise point of viability, see supra, at 860, but this is an imprecision within tolerable limits given that the medical community and all those who must apply its discoveries will continue to explore the matter. The viability line also has, as a practical matter, an element of fairness. In some broad sense it might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consented to the State's intervention on behalf of the developing child.\n\n*871 The woman's right to terminate her pregnancy before viability is the most central principle of Roe v. Wade. It is a rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce.\n\nOn the other side of the equation is the interest of the State in the protection of potential life. The Roe Court recognized the State's \"important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.\" Roe, supra, at 162. The weight to be given this state interest, not the strength of the woman's interest, was the difficult question faced in Roe. We do not need to say whether each of us, had we been Members of the Court when the valuation of the state interest came before it as an original matter, would have concluded, as the Roe Court did, that its weight is insufficient to justify a ban on abortions prior to viability even when it is subject to certain exceptions. The matter is not before us in the first instance, and coming as it does after nearly 20 years of litigation in Roe `s wake we are satisfied that the immediate question is not the soundness of Roe `s resolution of the issue, but the precedential force that must be accorded to its holding. And we have concluded that the essential holding of Roe should be reaffirmed.\n\nYet it must be remembered that Roe v. Wade speaks with clarity in establishing not only the woman's liberty but also the State's \"important and legitimate interest in potential life.\" Roe, supra, at 163. That portion of the decision in Roe has been given too little acknowledgment and implementation by the Court in its subsequent cases. Those cases decided that any regulation touching upon the abortion decision must survive strict scrutiny, to be sustained only if drawn in narrow terms to further a compelling state interest. See, e. g., Akron I, supra, at 427. Not all of the cases decided under that formulation can be reconciled with the holding in Roe itself that the State has legitimate interests in the health of the woman and in protecting the potential life within her. In resolving this tension, we choose to rely upon Roe, as against the later cases.\n\n*872 Roe established a trimester framework to govern abortion regulations. Under this elaborate but rigid construct, almost no regulation at all is permitted during the first trimester of pregnancy; regulations designed to protect the woman's health, but not to further the State's interest in potential life, are permitted during the second trimester; and during the third trimester, when the fetus is viable, prohibitions are permitted provided the life or health of the mother is not at stake. Roe, supra, at 163-166. Most of our cases since Roe  have involved the application of rules derived from the trimester framework. See, e. g., Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, supra; Akron I, supra.\n\nThe trimester framework no doubt was erected to ensure that the woman's right to choose not become so subordinate to the State's interest in promoting fetal life that her choice exists in theory but not in fact. We do not agree, however, that the trimester approach is necessary to accomplish this objective. A framework of this rigidity was unnecessary and in its later interpretation sometimes contradicted the State's permissible exercise of its powers.\n\nThough the woman has a right to choose to terminate or continue her pregnancy before viability, it does not at all follow that the State is prohibited from taking steps to ensure that this choice is thoughtful and informed. Even in the earliest stages of pregnancy, the State may enact rules and regulations designed to encourage her to know that there are philosophic and social arguments of great weight that can be brought to bear in favor of continuing the pregnancy to full term and that there are procedures and institutions to allow adoption of unwanted children as well as a certain degree of state assistance if the mother chooses to raise the child herself. \"`[T]he Constitution does not forbid a State or city, pursuant to democratic processes, from expressing a preference for normal childbirth.' \" Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S., at 511 (opinion of *873 the Court) (quoting Poelker v. Doe, 432 U. S. 519, 521 (1977)). It follows that States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning. This, too, we find consistent with Roe `s central premises, and indeed the inevitable consequence of our holding that the State has an interest in protecting the life of the unborn.\n\nWe reject the trimester framework, which we do not consider to be part of the essential holding of Roe. See Webster  v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S., at 518 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.); id., at 529 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (describing the trimester framework as \"problematic\"). Measures aimed at ensuring that a woman's choice contemplates the consequences for the fetus do not necessarily interfere with the right recognized in Roe, although those measures have been found to be inconsistent with the rigid trimester framework announced in that case. A logical reading of the central holding in Roe itself, and a necessary reconciliation of the liberty of the woman and the interest of the State in promoting prenatal life, require, in our view, that we abandon the trimester framework as a rigid prohibition on all previability regulation aimed at the protection of fetal life. The trimester framework suffers from these basic flaws: in its formulation it misconceives the nature of the pregnant woman's interest; and in practice it undervalues the State's interest in potential life, as recognized in Roe.\n\nAs our jurisprudence relating to all liberties save perhaps abortion has recognized, not every law which makes a right more difficult to exercise is, ipso facto, an infringement of that right. An example clarifies the point. We have held that not every ballot access limitation amounts to an infringement of the right to vote. Rather, the States are granted substantial flexibility in establishing the framework within which voters choose the candidates for whom they *874 wish to vote. Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788 (1983); Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S. 279 (1992).\n\nThe abortion right is similar. Numerous forms of state regulation might have the incidental effect of increasing the cost or decreasing the availability of medical care, whether for abortion or any other medical procedure. The fact that a law which serves a valid purpose, one not designed to strike at the right itself, has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate it. Only where state regulation imposes an undue burden on a woman's ability to make this decision does the power of the State reach into the heart of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. See Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417, 458-459 (1990) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part); Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 519-520 (1990) (Akron II) (opinion of Kennedy, J.); Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, supra, at 530 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 828 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U. S. 506, 520 (1983) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc.  v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476, 505 (1983) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Akron I,  462 U. S., at 464 (O'Connor, J., joined by White and Rehnquist, JJ., dissenting); Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U. S. 132, 147 (1976) (Bellotti I) .\n\nFor the most part, the Court's early abortion cases adhered to this view. In Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464, 473-474 (1977), the Court explained: \"Roe did not declare an unqualified `constitutional right to an abortion,' as the District Court seemed to think. Rather, the right protects the woman from unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy.\" See *875 also Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179, 198 (1973) (\"[T]he interposition of the hospital abortion committee is unduly restrictive of the patient's rights\"); Bellotti I, supra, at 147 (State may not \"impose undue burdens upon a minor capable of giving an informed consent\"); Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 314 (1980) (citing Maher, supra ). Cf. Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S., at 688 (\"[T]he same test must be applied to state regulations that burden an individual's right to decide to prevent conception or terminate pregnancy by substantially limiting access to the means of effectuating that decision as is applied to state statutes that prohibit the decision entirely\").\n\nThese considerations of the nature of the abortion right illustrate that it is an overstatement to describe it as a right to decide whether to have an abortion \"without interference from the State.\" Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 61 (1976). All abortion regulations interfere to some degree with a woman's ability to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy. It is, as a consequence, not surprising that despite the protestations contained in the original Roe opinion to the effect that the Court was not recognizing an absolute right, 410 U. S., at 154-155, the Court's experience applying the trimester framework has led to the striking down of some abortion regulations which in no real sense deprived women of the ultimate decision. Those decisions went too far because the right recognized by Roe is a right \"to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\" Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S., at 453. Not all governmental intrusion is of necessity unwarranted; and that brings us to the other basic flaw in the trimester framework: even in Roe `s terms, in practice it undervalues the State's interest in the potential life within the woman.\n\nRoe v. Wade was express in its recognition of the State's \"important and legitimate interest[s] in preserving and protecting *876 the health of the pregnant woman [and] in protecting the potentiality of human life.\" 410 U. S., at 162. The trimester framework, however, does not fulfill Roe `s own promise that the State has an interest in protecting fetal life or potential life. Roe began the contradiction by using the trimester framework to forbid any regulation of abortion designed to advance that interest before viability. Id., at 163. Before viability, Roe and subsequent cases treat all governmental attempts to influence a woman's decision on behalf of the potential life within her as unwarranted. This treatment is, in our judgment, incompatible with the recognition that there is a substantial state interest in potential life throughout pregnancy. Cf. Webster, 492 U. S., at 519 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.); Akron I, supra, at 461 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).\n\nThe very notion that the State has a substantial interest in potential life leads to the conclusion that not all regulations must be deemed unwarranted. Not all burdens on the right to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy will be undue. In our view, the undue burden standard is the appropriate means of reconciling the State's interest with the woman's constitutionally protected liberty.\n\nThe concept of an undue burden has been utilized by the Court as well as individual Members of the Court, including two of us, in ways that could be considered inconsistent. See, e. g., Hodgson v. Minnesota, supra, at 459-461 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); Akron II, supra, at 519-520 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, supra, at 828-829 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); Akron I, supra, at 461-466 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); Harris v. McRae, supra, at 314; Maher v. Roe, supra, at 473; Beal v. Doe, 432 U. S. 438, 446 (1977); Bellotti I, supra, at 147. Because we set forth a standard of general application to which we intend to adhere, it is important to clarify what is meant by an undue burden.\n\n*877 A finding of an undue burden is a shorthand for the conclusion that a state regulation has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus. A statute with this purpose is invalid because the means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it. And a statute which, while furthering the interest in potential life or some other valid state interest, has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman's choice cannot be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends. To the extent that the opinions of the Court or of individual Justices use the undue burden standard in a manner that is inconsistent with this analysis, we set out what in our view should be the controlling standard. Cf. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 489 (1991) (attempting \"to define the doctrine of abuse of the writ with more precision\" after acknowledging tension among earlier cases). In our considered judgment, an undue burden is an unconstitutional burden. See Akron II, 497 U. S., at 519-520 (opinion of Kennedy, J.). Understood another way, we answer the question, left open in previous opinions discussing the undue burden formulation, whether a law designed to further the State's interest in fetal life which imposes an undue burden on the woman's decision before fetal viability could be constitutional. See, e. g., Akron I, 462 U. S., at 462-463 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). The answer is no.\n\nSome guiding principles should emerge. What is at stake is the woman's right to make the ultimate decision, not a right to be insulated from all others in doing so. Regulations which do no more than create a structural mechanism by which the State, or the parent or guardian of a minor, may express profound respect for the life of the unborn are permitted, if they are not a substantial obstacle to the woman's exercise of the right to choose. See infra, at 899-900 (addressing Pennsylvania's parental consent requirement).\n\n*878 Unless it has that effect on her right of choice, a state measure designed to persuade her to choose childbirth over abortion will be upheld if reasonably related to that goal. Regulations designed to foster the health of a woman seeking an abortion are valid if they do not constitute an undue burden.\n\nEven when jurists reason from shared premises, some disagreement is inevitable. Compare Hodgson, 497 U. S., at 482-497 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), with id., at 458-460 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part). That is to be expected in the application of any legal standard which must accommodate life's complexity. We do not expect it to be otherwise with respect to the undue burden standard. We give this summary:\n\n(a) To protect the central right recognized by Roe v. Wade  while at the same time accommodating the State's profound interest in potential life, we will employ the undue burden analysis as explained in this opinion. An undue burden exists, and therefore a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\n\n(b) We reject the rigid trimester framework of Roe v. Wade. To promote the State's profound interest in potential life, throughout pregnancy the State may take measures to ensure that the woman's choice is informed, and measures designed to advance this interest will not be invalidated as long as their purpose is to persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion. These measures must not be an undue burden on the right.\n\n(c) As with any medical procedure, the State may enact regulations to further the health or safety of a woman seeking an abortion. Unnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.\n\n*879 (d) Our adoption of the undue burden analysis does not disturb the central holding of Roe v. Wade, and we reaffirm that holding. Regardless of whether exceptions are made for particular circumstances, a State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability.\n\n(e) We also reaffirm Roe `s holding that \"subsequent to viability, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\" Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S., at 164-165.\n\nThese principles control our assessment of the Pennsylvania statute, and we now turn to the issue of the validity of its challenged provisions.VThe Court of Appeals applied what it believed to be the undue burden standard and upheld each of the provisions except for the husband notification requirement. We agree generally with this conclusion, but refine the undue burden analysis in accordance with the principles articulated above. We now consider the separate statutory sections at issue.ABecause it is central to the operation of various other requirements, we begin with the statute's definition of medical emergency. Under the statute, a medical emergency is\"[t]hat condition which, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\" 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3203 (1990).*880 Petitioners argue that the definition is too narrow, contending that it forecloses the possibility of an immediate abortion despite some significant health risks. If the contention were correct, we would be required to invalidate the restrictive operation of the provision, for the essential holding of Roe forbids a State to interfere with a woman's choice to undergo an abortion procedure if continuing her pregnancy would constitute a threat to her health. 410 U. S., at 164. See also Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S., at 316.\n\nThe District Court found that there were three serious conditions which would not be covered by the statute: preeclampsia, inevitable abortion, and premature ruptured membrane. 744 F. Supp., at 1378. Yet, as the Court of Appeals observed, 947 F. 2d, at 700-701, it is undisputed that under some circumstances each of these conditions could lead to an illness with substantial and irreversible consequences. While the definition could be interpreted in an unconstitutional manner, the Court of Appeals construed the phrase \"serious risk\" to include those circumstances. Id., at 701. It stated: \"[W]e read the medical emergency exception as intended by the Pennsylvania legislature to assure that compliance with its abortion regulations would not in any way pose a significant threat to the life or health of a woman.\" Ibid. As we said in Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 499-500 (1985): \"Normally, . . . we defer to the construction of a state statute given it by the lower federal courts.\" Indeed, we have said that we will defer to lower court interpretations of state law unless they amount to \"plain\" error. Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U. S. 109, 118 (1943). This \"`reflect[s] our belief that district courts and courts of appeals are better schooled in and more able to interpret the laws of their respective States.' \" Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 482 (1988) (citation omitted). We adhere to that course today, and conclude that, as construed by the Court of Appeals, the medical emergency definition imposes no undue burden on a woman's abortion right.\n\n*881 BWe next consider the informed consent requirement. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3205 (1990). Except in a medical emergency, the statute requires that at least 24 hours before performing an abortion a physician inform the woman of the nature of the procedure, the health risks of the abortion and of childbirth, and the \"probable gestational age of the unborn child.\" The physician or a qualified nonphysician must inform the woman of the availability of printed materials published by the State describing the fetus and providing information about medical assistance for childbirth, information about child support from the father, and a list of agencies which provide adoption and other services as alternatives to abortion. An abortion may not be performed unless the woman certifies in writing that she has been informed of the availability of these printed materials and has been provided them if she chooses to view them.\n\nOur prior decisions establish that as with any medical procedure, the State may require a woman to give her written informed consent to an abortion. See Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S., at 67. In this respect, the statute is unexceptional. Petitioners challenge the statute's definition of informed consent because it includes the provision of specific information by the doctor and the mandatory 24-hour waiting period. The conclusions reached by a majority of the Justices in the separate opinions filed today and the undue burden standard adopted in this opinion require us to overrule in part some of the Court's past decisions, decisions driven by the trimester framework's prohibition of all previability regulations designed to further the State's interest in fetal life.\n\nIn Akron I, 462 U. S. 416 (1983), we invalidated an ordinance which required that a woman seeking an abortion be provided by her physician with specific information \"designed to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth.\" Id., at 444. As we later described *882 the Akron I holding in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 762, there were two purported flaws in the Akron ordinance: the information was designed to dissuade the woman from having an abortion and the ordinance imposed \"a rigid requirement that a specific body of information be given in all cases, irrespective of the particular needs of the patient . . . .\" Ibid.\n\nTo the extent Akron I and Thornburgh find a constitutional violation when the government requires, as it does here, the giving of truthful, nonmisleading information about the nature of the procedure, the attendant health risks and those of childbirth, and the \"probable gestational age\" of the fetus, those cases go too far, are inconsistent with Roe `s acknowledgment of an important interest in potential life, and are overruled. This is clear even on the very terms of Akron I and Thornburgh. Those decisions, along with Danforth, recognize a substantial government interest justifying a requirement that a woman be apprised of the health risks of abortion and childbirth. E. g., Danforth, supra, at 66-67. It cannot be questioned that psychological well-being is a facet of health. Nor can it be doubted that most women considering an abortion would deem the impact on the fetus relevant, if not dispositive, to the decision. In attempting to ensure that a woman apprehend the full consequences of her decision, the State furthers the legitimate purpose of reducing the risk that a woman may elect an abortion, only to discover later, with devastating psychological consequences, that her decision was not fully informed. If the information the State requires to be made available to the woman is truthful and not misleading, the requirement may be permissible.\n\nWe also see no reason why the State may not require doctors to inform a woman seeking an abortion of the availability of materials relating to the consequences to the fetus, even when those consequences have no direct relation to her health. An example illustrates the point. We would think *883 it constitutional for the State to require that in order for there to be informed consent to a kidney transplant operation the recipient must be supplied with information about risks to the donor as well as risks to himself or herself. A requirement that the physician make available information similar to that mandated by the statute here was described in Thornburgh as \"an outright attempt to wedge the Commonwealth's message discouraging abortion into the privacy of the informed-consent dialogue between the woman and her physician.\" 476 U. S., at 762. We conclude, however, that informed choice need not be defined in such narrow terms that all considerations of the effect on the fetus are made irrelevant. As we have made clear, we depart from the holdings of Akron I and Thornburgh to the extent that we permit a State to further its legitimate goal of protecting the life of the unborn by enacting legislation aimed at ensuring a decision that is mature and informed, even when in so doing the State expresses a preference for childbirth over abortion. In short, requiring that the woman be informed of the availability of information relating to fetal development and the assistance available should she decide to carry the pregnancy to full term is a reasonable measure to ensure an informed choice, one which might cause the woman to choose childbirth over abortion. This requirement cannot be considered a substantial obstacle to obtaining an abortion, and, it follows, there is no undue burden.\n\nOur prior cases also suggest that the \"straitjacket,\" Thornburgh, supra, at 762 (quoting Danforth, supra, at 67, n. 8), of particular information which must be given in each case interferes with a constitutional right of privacy between a pregnant woman and her physician. As a preliminary matter, it is worth noting that the statute now before us does not require a physician to comply with the informed consent provisions \"if he or she can demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence, that he or she reasonably believed that furnishing the information would have resulted in a severely *884 adverse effect on the physical or mental health of the patient.\" 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3205 (1990). In this respect, the statute does not prevent the physician from exercising his or her medical judgment.\n\nWhatever constitutional status the doctor-patient relation may have as a general matter, in the present context it is derivative of the woman's position. The doctor-patient relation does not underlie or override the two more general rights under which the abortion right is justified: the right to make family decisions and the right to physical autonomy. On its own, the doctor-patient relation here is entitled to the same solicitude it receives in other contexts. Thus, a requirement that a doctor give a woman certain information as part of obtaining her consent to an abortion is, for constitutional purposes, no different from a requirement that a doctor give certain specific information about any medical procedure.\n\nAll that is left of petitioners' argument is an asserted First Amendment right of a physician not to provide information about the risks of abortion, and childbirth, in a manner mandated by the State. To be sure, the physician's First Amendment rights not to speak are implicated, see Wooley  v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705 (1977), but only as part of the practice of medicine, subject to reasonable licensing and regulation by the State, cf. Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 603 (1977). We see no constitutional infirmity in the requirement that the physician provide the information mandated by the State here.\n\nThe Pennsylvania statute also requires us to reconsider the holding in Akron I that the State may not require that a physician, as opposed to a qualified assistant, provide information relevant to a woman's informed consent. 462 U. S., at 448. Since there is no evidence on this record that requiring a doctor to give the information as provided by the statute would amount in practical terms to a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion, we conclude that it is not *885 an undue burden. Our cases reflect the fact that the Constitution gives the States broad latitude to decide that particular functions may be performed only by licensed professionals, even if an objective assessment might suggest that those same tasks could be performed by others. See Williamson  v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483 (1955). Thus, we uphold the provision as a reasonable means to ensure that the woman's consent is informed.\n\nOur analysis of Pennsylvania's 24-hour waiting period between the provision of the information deemed necessary to informed consent and the performance of an abortion under the undue burden standard requires us to reconsider the premise behind the decision in Akron I invalidating a parallel requirement. In Akron I we said: \"Nor are we convinced that the State's legitimate concern that the woman's decision be informed is reasonably served by requiring a 24-hour delay as a matter of course.\" 462 U. S., at 450. We consider that conclusion to be wrong. The idea that important decisions will be more informed and deliberate if they follow some period of reflection does not strike us as unreasonable, particularly where the statute directs that important information become part of the background of the decision. The statute, as construed by the Court of Appeals, permits avoidance of the waiting period in the event of a medical emergency and the record evidence shows that in the vast majority of cases, a 24-hour delay does not create any appreciable health risk. In theory, at least, the waiting period is a reasonable measure to implement the State's interest in protecting the life of the unborn, a measure that does not amount to an undue burden.\n\nWhether the mandatory 24-hour waiting period is nonetheless invalid because in practice it is a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to terminate her pregnancy is a closer question. The findings of fact by the District Court indicate that because of the distances many women must travel to reach an abortion provider, the practical effect will often be *886 a delay of much more than a day because the waiting period requires that a woman seeking an abortion make at least two visits to the doctor. The District Court also found that in many instances this will increase the exposure of women seeking abortions to \"the harassment and hostility of antiabortion protestors demonstrating outside a clinic.\" 744 F. Supp., at 1351. As a result, the District Court found that for those women who have the fewest financial resources, those who must travel long distances, and those who have difficulty explaining their whereabouts to husbands, employers, or others, the 24-hour waiting period will be \"particularly burdensome.\" Id., at 1352.\n\nThese findings are troubling in some respects, but they do not demonstrate that the waiting period constitutes an undue burden. We do not doubt that, as the District Court held, the waiting period has the effect of \"increasing the cost and risk of delay of abortions,\" id., at 1378, but the District Court did not conclude that the increased costs and potential delays amount to substantial obstacles. Rather, applying the trimester framework's strict prohibition of all regulation designed to promote the State's interest in potential life before viability, see id., at 1374, the District Court concluded that the waiting period does not further the state \"interest in maternal health\" and \"infringes the physician's discretion to exercise sound medical judgment,\" id., at 1378. Yet, as we have stated, under the undue burden standard a State is permitted to enact persuasive measures which favor childbirth over abortion, even if those measures do not further a health interest. And while the waiting period does limit a physician's discretion, that is not, standing alone, a reason to invalidate it. In light of the construction given the statute's definition of medical emergency by the Court of Appeals, and the District Court's findings, we cannot say that the waiting period imposes a real health risk.\n\nWe also disagree with the District Court's conclusion that the \"particularly burdensome\" effects of the waiting period *887 on some women require its invalidation. A particular burden is not of necessity a substantial obstacle. Whether a burden falls on a particular group is a distinct inquiry from whether it is a substantial obstacle even as to the women in that group. And the District Court did not conclude that the waiting period is such an obstacle even for the women who are most burdened by it. Hence, on the record before us, and in the context of this facial challenge, we are not convinced that the 24-hour waiting period constitutes an undue burden.\n\nWe are left with the argument that the various aspects of the informed consent requirement are unconstitutional because they place barriers in the way of abortion on demand. Even the broadest reading of Roe, however, has not suggested that there is a constitutional right to abortion on demand. See, e. g., Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S., at 189. Rather, the right protected by Roe is a right to decide to terminate a pregnancy free of undue interference by the State. Because the informed consent requirement facilitates the wise exercise of that right, it cannot be classified as an interference with the right Roe protects. The informed consent requirement is not an undue burden on that right.CSection 3209 of Pennsylvania's abortion law provides, except in cases of medical emergency, that no physician shall perform an abortion on a married woman without receiving a signed statement from the woman that she has notified her spouse that she is about to undergo an abortion. The woman has the option of providing an alternative signed statement certifying that her husband is not the man who impregnated her; that her husband could not be located; that the pregnancy is the result of spousal sexual assault which she has reported; or that the woman believes that notifying her husband will cause him or someone else to inflict bodily injury upon her. A physician who performs an abortion on *888 a married woman without receiving the appropriate signed statement will have his or her license revoked, and is liable to the husband for damages.\n\nThe District Court heard the testimony of numerous expert witnesses, and made detailed findings of fact regarding the effect of this statute. These included:\"273. The vast majority of women consult their husbands prior to deciding to terminate their pregnancy. . . .. . . . .\"279. The `bodily injury' exception could not be invoked by a married woman whose husband, if notified, would, in her reasonable belief, threaten to (a) publicize her intent to have an abortion to family, friends or acquaintances; (b) retaliate against her in future child custody or divorce proceedings; (c) inflict psychological intimidation or emotional harm upon her, her children or other persons; (d) inflict bodily harm on other persons such as children, family members or other loved ones; or (e) use his control over finances to deprive of necessary monies for herself or her children. . . .. . . . .\"281. Studies reveal that family violence occurs in two million families in the United States. This figure, however, is a conservative one that substantially understates (because battering is usually not reported until it reaches life-threatening proportions) the actual number of families affected by domestic violence. In fact, researchers estimate that one of every two women will be battered at some time in their life. . . .\"282. A wife may not elect to notify her husband of her intention to have an abortion for a variety of reasons, including the husband's illness, concern about her own health, the imminent failure of the marriage, or the husband's absolute opposition to the abortion. . . .\"283. The required filing of the spousal consent form would require plaintiff-clinics to change their counseling *889 procedures and force women to reveal their most intimate decision-making on pain of criminal sanctions. The confidentiality of these revelations could not be guaranteed, since the woman's records are not immune from subpoena. . . .\"284. Women of all class levels, educational backgrounds, and racial, ethnic and religious groups are battered. . . .\"285. Wife-battering or abuse can take on many physical and psychological forms. The nature and scope of the battering can cover a broad range of actions and be gruesome and torturous. . . .\"286. Married women, victims of battering, have been killed in Pennsylvania and throughout the United States. . . .\"287. Battering can often involve a substantial amount of sexual abuse, including marital rape and sexual mutilation. . . .\"288. In a domestic abuse situation, it is common for the battering husband to also abuse the children in an attempt to coerce the wife. . . .\"289. Mere notification of pregnancy is frequently a flashpoint for battering and violence within the family. The number of battering incidents is high during the pregnancy and often the worst abuse can be associated with pregnancy. . . . The battering husband may deny parentage and use the pregnancy as an excuse for abuse. . . .\"290. Secrecy typically shrouds abusive families. Family members are instructed not to tell anyone, especially police or doctors, about the abuse and violence. Battering husbands often threaten their wives or her children with further abuse if she tells an outsider of the violence and tells her that nobody will believe her. A battered woman, therefore, is highly unlikely to disclose *890 the violence against her for fear of retaliation by the abuser. . . .\"291. Even when confronted directly by medical personnel or other helping professionals, battered women often will not admit to the battering because they have not admitted to themselves that they are battered. . . .. . . . .\"294. A woman in a shelter or a safe house unknown to her husband is not `reasonably likely' to have bodily harm inflicted upon her by her batterer, however her attempt to notify her husband pursuant to section 3209 could accidentally disclose her whereabouts to her husband. Her fear of future ramifications would be realistic under the circumstances.\"295. Marital rape is rarely discussed with others or reported to law enforcement authorities, and of those reported only few are prosecuted. . . .\"296. It is common for battered women to have sexual intercourse with their husbands to avoid being battered. While this type of coercive sexual activity would be spousal sexual assault as defined by the Act, many women may not consider it to be so and others would fear disbelief. . . .\"297. The marital rape exception to section 3209 cannot be claimed by women who are victims of coercive sexual behavior other than penetration. The 90-day reporting requirement of the spousal sexual assault statute, 18 Pa. Con. Stat. Ann.  3218(c), further narrows the class of sexually abused wives who can claim the exception, since many of these women may be psychologically unable to discuss or report the rape for several years after the incident. . . .\"298. Because of the nature of the battering relationship, battered women are unlikely to avail themselves of the exceptions to section 3209 of the Act, regardless of *891 whether the section applies to them.\" 744 F. Supp., at 1360-1362 (footnote omitted).These findings are supported by studies of domestic violence. The American Medical Association (AMA) has published a summary of the recent research in this field, which indicates that in an average 12-month period in this country, approximately two million women are the victims of severe assaults by their male partners. In a 1985 survey, women reported that nearly one of every eight husbands had assaulted their wives during the past year. The AMA views these figures as \"marked underestimates,\" because the nature of these incidents discourages women from reporting them, and because surveys typically exclude the very poor, those who do not speak English well, and women who are homeless or in institutions or hospitals when the survey is conducted. According to the AMA, \"[r]esearchers on family violence agree that the true incidence of partner violence is probably double the above estimates; or four million severely assaulted women per year. Studies on prevalence suggest that from one-fifth to one-third of all women will be physically assaulted by a partner or ex-partner during their lifetime.\" AMA Council on Scientific Affairs, Violence Against Women 7 (1991) (emphasis in original). Thus on an average day in the United States, nearly 11,000 women are severely assaulted by their male partners. Many of these incidents involve sexual assault. Id., at 3-4; Shields & Hanneke,\n\nBattered Wives' Reactions to Marital Rape, in The Dark Side of Families: Current Family Violence Research 131, 144 (D. Finkelhor, R. Gelles, G. Hataling, & M. Straus eds. 1983). In families where wifebeating takes place, moreover, child abuse is often present as well. Violence Against Women, supra, at 12.\n\nOther studies fill in the rest of this troubling picture. Physical violence is only the most visible form of abuse. Psychological abuse, particularly forced social and economic isolation of women, is also common. L. Walker, The Battered *892 Woman Syndrome 27-28 (1984). Many victims of domestic violence remain with their abusers, perhaps because they perceive no superior alternative. Herbert, Silver, & Ellard, Coping with an Abusive Relationship: I. How and Why do Women Stay?, 53 J. Marriage & the Family 311 (1991). Many abused women who find temporary refuge in shelters return to their husbands, in large part because they have no other source of income. Aguirre, Why Do They Return? Abused Wives in Shelters, 30 J. Nat. Assn. of Social Workers 350, 352 (1985). Returning to one's abuser can be dangerous. Recent Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics disclose that 8.8 percent of all homicide victims in the United States are killed by their spouses. Mercy & Saltzman, Fatal Violence Among Spouses in the United States, 1976-85, 79 Am. J. Public Health 595 (1989). Thirty percent of female homicide victims are killed by their male partners. Domestic Violence: Terrorism in the Home, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Children, Family, Drugs and Alcoholism of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1990).\n\nThe limited research that has been conducted with respect to notifying one's husband about an abortion, although involving samples too small to be representative, also supports the District Court's findings of fact. The vast majority of women notify their male partners of their decision to obtain an abortion. In many cases in which married women do not notify their husbands, the pregnancy is the result of an extramarital affair. Where the husband is the father, the primary reason women do not notify their husbands is that the husband and wife are experiencing marital difficulties, often accompanied by incidents of violence. Ryan & Plutzer, When Married Women Have Abortions: Spousal Notification and Marital Interaction, 51 J. Marriage & the Family 41, 44 (1989).\n\nThis information and the District Court's findings reinforce what common sense would suggest. In wellfunctioning *893 marriages, spouses discuss important intimate decisions such as whether to bear a child. But there are millions of women in this country who are the victims of regular physical and psychological abuse at the hands of their husbands. Should these women become pregnant, they may have very good reasons for not wishing to inform their husbands of their decision to obtain an abortion. Many may have justifiable fears of physical abuse, but may be no less fearful of the consequences of reporting prior abuse to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Many may have a reasonable fear that notifying their husbands will provoke further instances of child abuse; these women are not exempt from  3209's notification requirement. Many may fear devastating forms of psychological abuse from their husbands, including verbal harassment, threats of future violence, the destruction of possessions, physical confinement to the home, the withdrawal of financial support, or the disclosure of the abortion to family and friends. These methods of psychological abuse may act as even more of a deterrent to notification than the possibility of physical violence, but women who are the victims of the abuse are not exempt from  3209's notification requirement. And many women who are pregnant as a result of sexual assaults by their husbands will be unable to avail themselves of the exception for spousal sexual assault,  3209(b)(3), because the exception requires that the woman have notified law enforcement authorities within 90 days of the assault, and her husband will be notified of her report once an investigation begins,  3128(c). If anything in this field is certain, it is that victims of spousal sexual assault are extremely reluctant to report the abuse to the government; hence, a great many spousal rape victims will not be exempt from the notification requirement imposed by  3209.\n\nThe spousal notification requirement is thus likely to prevent a significant number of women from obtaining an abortion. It does not merely make abortions a little more difficult or expensive to obtain; for many women, it will impose *894 a substantial obstacle. We must not blind ourselves to the fact that the significant number of women who fear for their safety and the safety of their children are likely to be deterred from procuring an abortion as surely as if the Commonwealth had outlawed abortion in all cases.\n\nRespondents attempt to avoid the conclusion that  3209 is invalid by pointing out that it imposes almost no burden at all for the vast majority of women seeking abortions. They begin by noting that only about 20 percent of the women who obtain abortions are married. They then note that of these women about 95 percent notify their husbands of their own volition. Thus, respondents argue, the effects of  3209 are felt by only one percent of the women who obtain abortions. Respondents argue that since some of these women will be able to notify their husbands without adverse consequences or will qualify for one of the exceptions, the statute affects fewer than one percent of women seeking abortions. For this reason, it is asserted, the statute cannot be invalid on its face. See Brief for Respondents 83-86. We disagree with respondents' basic method of analysis.\n\nThe analysis does not end with the one percent of women upon whom the statute operates; it begins there. Legislation is measured for consistency with the Constitution by its impact on those whose conduct it affects. For example, we would not say that a law which requires a newspaper to print a candidate's reply to an unfavorable editorial is valid on its face because most newspapers would adopt the policy even absent the law. See Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U. S. 241 (1974). The proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.\n\nRespondents' argument itself gives implicit recognition to this principle, at one of its critical points. Respondents speak of the one percent of women seeking abortions who are married and would choose not to notify their husbands of their plans. By selecting as the controlling class women *895 who wish to obtain abortions, rather than all women or all pregnant women, respondents in effect concede that  3209 must be judged by reference to those for whom it is an actual rather than an irrelevant restriction. Of course, as we have said,  3209's real target is narrower even than the class of women seeking abortions identified by the State: it is married women seeking abortions who do not wish to notify their husbands of their intentions and who do not qualify for one of the statutory exceptions to the notice requirement. The unfortunate yet persisting conditions we document above will mean that in a large fraction of the cases in which  3209 is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion. It is an undue burden, and therefore invalid.\n\nThis conclusion is in no way inconsistent with our decisions upholding parental notification or consent requirements. See, e. g., Akron II, 497 U. S., at 510-519; Bellotti v. Baird,  443 U. S. 622 (1979) (Bellotti II); Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S., at 74. Those enactments, and our judgment that they are constitutional, are based on the quite reasonable assumption that minors will benefit from consultation with their parents and that children will often not realize that their parents have their best interests at heart. We cannot adopt a parallel assumption about adult women.\n\nWe recognize that a husband has a \"deep and proper concern and interest . . . in his wife's pregnancy and in the growth and development of the fetus she is carrying.\" Danforth, supra, at 69. With regard to the children he has fathered and raised, the Court has recognized his \"cognizable and substantial\" interest in their custody. Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 651-652 (1972); see also Quilloin v. Walcott, 434 U. S. 246 (1978); Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U. S. 380 (1979); Lehr v. Robertson, 463 U. S. 248 (1983). If these cases concerned a State's ability to require the mother to notify the father before taking some action with respect to a living *896 child raised by both, therefore, it would be reasonable to conclude as a general matter that the father's interest in the welfare of the child and the mother's interest are equal.\n\nBefore birth, however, the issue takes on a very different cast. It is an inescapable biological fact that state regulation with respect to the child a woman is carrying will have a far greater impact on the mother's liberty than on the father's. The effect of state regulation on a woman's protected liberty is doubly deserving of scrutiny in such a case, as the State has touched not only upon the private sphere of the family but upon the very bodily integrity of the pregnant woman. Cf. Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S., at 281. The Court has held that \"when the wife and the husband disagree on this decision, the view of only one of the two marriage partners can prevail. Inasmuch as it is the woman who physically bears the child and who is the more directly and immediately affected by the pregnancy, as between the two, the balance weighs in her favor.\" Danforth, supra, at 71. This conclusion rests upon the basic nature of marriage and the nature of our Constitution: \"[T]he marital couple is not an independent entity with a mind and heart of its own, but an association of two individuals each with a separate intellectual and emotional makeup. If the right of privacy means anything, it is the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.\" Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S., at 453 (emphasis in original). The Constitution protects individuals, men and women alike, from unjustified state interference, even when that interference is enacted into law for the benefit of their spouses.\n\nThere was a time, not so long ago, when a different understanding of the family and of the Constitution prevailed. In Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873), three Members of this *897 Court reaffirmed the common-law principle that \"a woman had no legal existence separate from her husband, who was regarded as her head and representative in the social state; and, notwithstanding some recent modifications of this civil status, many of the special rules of law flowing from and dependent upon this cardinal principle still exist in full force in most States.\" Id., at 141 (Bradley, J., joined by Swayne and Field, JJ., concurring in judgment). Only one generation has passed since this Court observed that \"woman is still regarded as the center of home and family life,\" with attendant \"special responsibilities\" that precluded full and independent legal status under the Constitution. Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961). These views, of course, are no longer consistent with our understanding of the family, the individual, or the Constitution.\n\nIn keeping with our rejection of the common-law understanding of a woman's role within the family, the Court held in Danforth that the Constitution does not permit a State to require a married woman to obtain her husband's consent before undergoing an abortion. 428 U. S., at 69. The principles that guided the Court in Danforth should be our guides today. For the great many women who are victims of abuse inflicted by their husbands, or whose children are the victims of such abuse, a spousal notice requirement enables the husband to wield an effective veto over his wife's decision. Whether the prospect of notification itself deters such women from seeking abortions, or whether the husband, through physical force or psychological pressure or economic coercion, prevents his wife from obtaining an abortion until it is too late, the notice requirement will often be tantamount to the veto found unconstitutional in Danforth.  The women most affected by this lawthose who most reasonably fear the consequences of notifying their husbands that they are pregnantare in the gravest danger.\n\n*898 The husband's interest in the life of the child his wife is carrying does not permit the State to empower him with this troubling degree of authority over his wife. The contrary view leads to consequences reminiscent of the common law. A husband has no enforceable right to require a wife to advise him before she exercises her personal choices. If a husband's interest in the potential life of the child outweighs a wife's liberty, the State could require a married woman to notify her husband before she uses a postfertilization contraceptive. Perhaps next in line would be a statute requiring pregnant married women to notify their husbands before engaging in conduct causing risks to the fetus. After all,if the husband's interest in the fetus' safety is a sufficient predicate for state regulation, the State could reasonably conclude that pregnant wives should notify their husbands before drinking alcohol or smoking. Perhaps married women should notify their husbands before using contraceptives or before undergoing any type of surgery that may have complications affecting the husband's interest in his wife's reproductive organs. And if a husband's interest justifies notice in any of these cases, one might reasonably argue that it justifies exactly what the Danforth Court held it did not justifya requirement of the husband's consent as well. A State may not give to a man the kind of dominion over his wife that parents exercise over their children.\n\nSection 3209 embodies a view of marriage consonant with the common-law status of married women but repugnant to our present understanding of marriage and of the nature of the rights secured by the Constitution. Women do not lose their constitutionally protected liberty when they marry. The Constitution protects all individuals, male or female, married or unmarried, from the abuse of governmental power, even where that power is employed for the supposed benefit of a member of the individual's family. These considerations confirm our conclusion that  3209 is invalid.D*899\nWe next consider the parental consent provision. Except in a medical emergency, an unemancipated young woman under 18 may not obtain an abortion unless she and one of her parents (or guardian) provides informed consent as defined above. If neither a parent nor a guardian provides consent, a court may authorize the performance of an abortion upon a determination that the young woman is mature and capable of giving informed consent and has in fact given her informed consent, or that an abortion would be in her best interests.\n\nWe have been over most of this ground before. Our cases establish, and we reaffirm today, that a State may require a minor seeking an abortion to obtain the consent of a parent or guardian, provided that there is an adequate judicial bypass procedure. See, e. g., Akron II, 497 U. S., at 510-519; Hodgson, 497 U. S., at 461 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part); id., at 497-501 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Akron I, 462 U. S., at 440; Bellotti II, 443 U. S., at 643-644 (plurality opinion). Under these precedents, in our view, the one-parent consent requirement and judicial bypass procedure are constitutional.\n\nThe only argument made by petitioners respecting this provision and to which our prior decisions do not speak is the contention that the parental consent requirement is invalid because it requires informed parental consent. For the most part, petitioners' argument is a reprise of their argument with respect to the informed consent requirement in general, and we reject it for the reasons given above. Indeed, some of the provisions regarding informed consent have particular force with respect to minors: the waiting period, for example, may provide the parent or parents of a pregnant young woman the opportunity to consult with her in private, and to discuss the consequences of her decision in *900 the context of the values and moral or religious principles of their family. See Hodgson, supra, at 448-449 (opinion of Stevens, J.).EUnder the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of the statute, every facility which performs abortions is required to file a report stating its name and address as well as the name and address of any related entity, such as a controlling or subsidiary organization. In the case of statefunded institutions, the information becomes public.\n\nFor each abortion performed, a report must be filed identifying: the physician (and the second physician where required); the facility; the referring physician or agency; the woman's age; the number of prior pregnancies and prior abortions she has had; gestational age; the type of abortion procedure; the date of the abortion; whether there were any pre-existing medical conditions which would complicate pregnancy; medical complications with the abortion; where applicable, the basis for the determination that the abortion was medically necessary; the weight of the aborted fetus; and whether the woman was married, and if so, whether notice was provided or the basis for the failure to give notice. Every abortion facility must also file quarterly reports showing the number of abortions performed broken down by trimester. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3207, 3214 (1990). In all events, the identity of each woman who has had an abortion remains confidential.\n\nIn Danforth, 428 U. S., at 80, we held that recordkeeping and reporting provisions \"that are reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health and that properly respect a patient's confidentiality and privacy are permissible.\" We think that under this standard, all the provisions at issue here, except that relating to spousal notice, are constitutional. Although they do not relate to the State's interest in informing the woman's choice, they do relate to health. The collection of information with respect to actual patients *901 is a vital element of medical research, and so it cannot be said that the requirements serve no purpose other than to make abortions more difficult. Nor do we find that the requirements impose a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice. At most they might increase the cost of some abortions by a slight amount. While at some point increased cost could become a substantial obstacle, there is no such showing on the record before us.\n\nSubsection (12) of the reporting provision requires the reporting of, among other things, a married woman's \"reason for failure to provide notice\" to her husband.  3214(a)(12). This provision in effect requires women, as a condition of obtaining an abortion, to provide the Commonwealth with the precise information we have already recognized that many women have pressing reasons not to reveal. Like the spousal notice requirement itself, this provision places an undue burden on a woman's choice, and must be invalidated for that reason.VIOur Constitution is a covenant running from the first generation of Americans to us and then to future generations. It is a coherent succession. Each generation must learn anew that the Constitution's written terms embody ideas and aspirations that must survive more ages than one. We accept our responsibility not to retreat from interpreting the full meaning of the covenant in light of all of our precedents. We invoke it once again to define the freedom guaranteed by the Constitution's own promise, the promise of liberty.* * *The judgment in No. 91-902 is affirmed. The judgment in No. 91-744 is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion, including consideration of the question of severability.\n\nIt is so ordered.\n*902Justice Stevens, concurring in part and dissenting in part.The portions of the Court's opinion that I have joined are more important than those with which I disagree. I shall therefore first comment on significant areas of agreement, and then explain the limited character of my disagreement.*912 IThe Court is unquestionably correct in concluding that the doctrine of stare decisis has controlling significance in a case of this kind, notwithstanding an individual Justice's concerns about the merits.[1] The central holding of Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), has been a \"part of our law\" for almost two decades. Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth,  428 U. S. 52, 101 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). It was a natural sequel to the protection of individual liberty established in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965). See also Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S. 678, 687, 702 (1977) (White, J., concurring in part and concurring in result). The societal costs of overruling Roe at this late date would be enormous. Roe is an integral part of a correct understanding of both the concept of liberty and the basic equality of men and women.\n\nStare decisis also provides a sufficient basis for my agreement with the joint opinion's reaffirmation of Roe `s postviability analysis. Specifically, I accept the proposition that \"[i]f the State is interested in protecting fetal life after viability, it may go so far as to proscribe abortion during that period, except when it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.\" 410 U. S., at 163-164; see ante, at 879.\n\nI also accept what is implicit in the Court's analysis, namely, a reaffirmation of Roe `s explanation of why the State's obligation to protect the life or health of the mother *913 must take precedence over any duty to the unborn. The Court in Roe carefully considered, and rejected, the State's argument \"that the fetus is a `person' within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\" 410 U. S., at 156. After analyzing the usage of \"person\" in the Constitution, the Court concluded that that word \"has application only postnatally.\" Id., at 157. Commenting on the contingent property interests of the unborn that are generally represented by guardians ad litem, the Court noted: \"Perfection of the interests involved, again, has generally been contingent upon live birth. In short, the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense.\" Id.,  at 162. Accordingly, an abortion is not \"the termination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection.\" Id., at 159. From this holding, there was no dissent, see id., at 173; indeed, no Member of the Court has ever questioned this fundamental proposition. Thus, as a matter of federal constitutional law, a developing organism that is not yet a \"person\" does not have what is sometimes described as a \"right to life.\"[2] This has been and, by the Court's holding today, *914 remains a fundamental premise of our constitutional law governing reproductive autonomy.IIMy disagreement with the joint opinion begins with its understanding of the trimester framework established in Roe. Contrary to the suggestion of the joint opinion, ante,  at 876, it is not a \"contradiction\" to recognize that the State may have a legitimate interest in potential human life and, at the same time, to conclude that that interest does not justify the regulation of abortion before viability (although other interests, such as maternal health, may). The fact that the State's interest is legitimate does not tell us when, if ever, that interest outweighs the pregnant woman's interest in personal liberty. It is appropriate, therefore, to consider more carefully the nature of the interests at stake.\n\nFirst, it is clear that, in order to be legitimate, the State's interest must be secular; consistent with the First Amendment the State may not promote a theological or sectarian interest. See Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 778 (1986) (Stevens, J., concurring); see generally Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 563-572 (1989) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, as discussed above, the state interest in potential human life is not an interest in loco parentis, for the fetus is not a person.\n\nIdentifying the State's interestswhich the States rarely articulate with any precisionmakes clear that the interest in protecting potential life is not grounded in the Constitution. It is, instead, an indirect interest supported by both humanitarian and pragmatic concerns. Many of our citizens believe that any abortion reflects an unacceptable disrespect for potential human life and that the performance of more *915 than a million abortions each year is intolerable; many find third-trimester abortions performed when the fetus is approaching personhood particularly offensive. The State has a legitimate interest in minimizing such offense. The State may also have a broader interest in expanding the population,[3] believing society would benefit from the services of additional productive citizensor that the potential human lives might include the occasional Mozart or Curie. These are the kinds of concerns that comprise the State's interest in potential human life.\n\nIn counterpoise is the woman's constitutional interest in liberty. One aspect of this liberty is a right to bodily integrity, a right to control one's person. See, e. g., Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952); Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942). This right is neutral on the question of abortion: The Constitution would be equally offended by an absolute requirement that all women undergo abortions as by an absolute prohibition on abortions. \"Our whole constitutional heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to control men's minds.\" Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557, 565 (1969). The same holds true for the power to control women's bodies.\n\nThe woman's constitutional liberty interest also involves her freedom to decide matters of the highest privacy and the most personal nature. Cf. Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, *916 598-600 (1977). A woman considering abortion faces \"a difficult choice having serious and personal consequences of major importance to her own futureperhaps to the salvation of her own immortal soul.\" Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 781. The authority to make such traumatic and yet empowering decisions is an element of basic human dignity. As the joint opinion so eloquently demonstrates, a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy is nothing less than a matter of conscience.\n\nWeighing the State's interest in potential life and the woman's liberty interest, I agree with the joint opinion that the State may \"` \"expres[s] a preference for normal childbirth,\"` \" that the State may take steps to ensure that a woman's choice \"is thoughtful and informed,\" and that \"States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning.\" Ante, at 872-873. Serious questions arise, however, when a State attempts to \"persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion.\" Ante, at 878. Decisional autonomy must limit the State's power to inject into a woman's most personal deliberations its own views of what is best. The State may promote its preferences by funding childbirth, by creating and maintaining alternatives to abortion, and by espousing the virtues of family; but it must respect the individual's freedom to make such judgments.\n\nThis theme runs throughout our decisions concerning reproductive freedom. In general, Roe `s requirement that restrictions on abortions before viability be justified by the State's interest in maternal health has prevented States from interjecting regulations designed to influence a woman's decision. Thus, we have upheld regulations of abortion that are not efforts to sway or direct a woman's choice, but rather are efforts to enhance the deliberative quality of that decision or are neutral regulations on the health aspects of her decision. We have, for example, upheld regulations requiring *917 written informed consent, see Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52 (1976); limited recordkeeping and reporting, see ibid.; and pathology reports, see Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476 (1983); as well as various licensing and qualification provisions, see, e. g., Roe, 410 U. S., at 150; Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U. S. 506 (1983). Conversely, we have consistently rejected state efforts to prejudice a woman's choice, either by limiting the information available to her, see Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809 (1975), or by \"requir[ing] the delivery of information designed `to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth.' \" Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 760; see also Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 442-449 (1983).\n\nIn my opinion, the principles established in this long line of cases and the wisdom reflected in Justice Powell's opinion for the Court in Akron (and followed by the Court just six years ago in Thornburgh ) should govern our decision today. Under these principles, Pa. Cons. Stat.  3205(a)(2)(i)(iii) (1990) of the Pennsylvania statute are unconstitutional. Those sections require a physician or counselor to provide the woman with a range of materials clearly designed to persuade her to choose not to undergo the abortion. While the Commonwealth is free, pursuant to  3208 of the Pennsylvania law, to produce and disseminate such material, the Commonwealth may not inject such information into the woman's deliberations just as she is weighing such an important choice.\n\nUnder this same analysis,  3205(a)(1)(i) and (iii) of the Pennsylvania statute are constitutional. Those sections, which require the physician to inform a woman of the nature and risks of the abortion procedure and the medical risks of carrying to term, are neutral requirements comparable to those imposed in other medical procedures. Those sections indicate no effort by the Commonwealth to influence the *918 woman's choice in any way. If anything, such requirements enhance, rather than skew, the woman's decisionmaking.IIIThe 24-hour waiting period required by  3205(a)(1)(2) of the Pennsylvania statute raises even more serious concerns. Such a requirement arguably furthers the Commonwealth's interests in two ways, neither of which is constitutionally permissible.\n\nFirst, it may be argued that the 24-hour delay is justified by the mere fact that it is likely to reduce the number of abortions, thus furthering the Commonwealth's interest in potential life. But such an argument would justify any form of coercion that placed an obstacle in the woman's path. The Commonwealth cannot further its interests by simply wearing down the ability of the pregnant woman to exercise her constitutional right.\n\nSecond, it can more reasonably be argued that the 24-hour delay furthers the Commonwealth's interest in ensuring that the woman's decision is informed and thoughtful. But there is no evidence that the mandated delay benefits women or that it is necessary to enable the physician to convey any relevant information to the patient. The mandatory delay thus appears to rest on outmoded and unacceptable assumptions about the decisionmaking capacity of women. While there are well-established and consistently maintained reasons for the Commonwealth to view with skepticism the ability of minors to make decisions, see Hodgson v. Minnesota,  497 U. S. 417, 449 (1990),[4] none of those reasons applies to an *919 adult woman's decisionmaking ability. Just as we have left behind the belief that a woman must consult her husband before undertaking serious matters, see ante, at 895-898, so we must reject the notion that a woman is less capable of deciding matters of gravity. Cf. Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971).\n\nIn the alternative, the delay requirement may be premised on the belief that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is presumptively wrong. This premise is illegitimate. Those who disagree vehemently about the legality and morality of abortion agree about one thing: The decision to terminate a pregnancy is profound and difficult. No person undertakes such a decision lightlyand States may not presume that a woman has failed to reflect adequately merely because her conclusion differs from the State's preference. A woman who has, in the privacy of her thoughts and conscience, weighed the options and made her decision cannot be forced to reconsider all, simply because the State believes she has come to the wrong conclusion.[5]*920 Part of the constitutional liberty to choose is the equal dignity to which each of us is entitled. A woman who decides to terminate her pregnancy is entitled to the same respect as a woman who decides to carry the fetus to term. The mandatory waiting period denies women that equal respect.IVIn my opinion, a correct application of the \"undue burden\" standard leads to the same conclusion concerning the constitutionality of these requirements. A state-imposed burden on the exercise of a constitutional right is measured both by its effects and by its character: A burden may be \"undue\" either because the burden is too severe or because it lacks a legitimate, rational justification.[6]\n\nThe 24-hour delay requirement fails both parts of this test. The findings of the District Court establish the severity of *921 the burden that the 24-hour delay imposes on many pregnant women. Yet even in those cases in which the delay is not especially onerous, it is,in my opinion, \"undue\" because there is no evidence that such a delay serves a useful and legitimate purpose. As indicated above, there is no legitimate reason to require a woman who has agonized over her decision to leave the clinic or hospital and return again another day. While a general requirement that a physician notify her patients about the risks of a proposed medical procedure is appropriate, a rigid requirement that all patients wait 24 hours or (what is true in practice) much longer to evaluate the significance of information that is either common knowledge or irrelevant is an irrational and, therefore, \"undue\" burden.\n\nThe counseling provisions are similarly infirm. Whenever government commands private citizens to speak or to listen, careful review of the justification for that command is particularly appropriate. In these cases, the Pennsylvania statute directs that counselors provide women seeking abortions with information concerning alternatives to abortion, the availability of medical assistance benefits, and the possibility of child-support payments.  3205(a)(2)(i)(iii). The statute requires that this information be given to all women seeking abortions, including those for whom such information is clearly useless, such as those who are married, those who have undergone the procedure in the past and are fully aware of the options, and those who are fully convinced that abortion is their only reasonable option. Moreover, the statute requires physicians to inform all of their patients of \"[t]he probable gestational age of the unborn child.\"  3205(a)(1)(ii). This information is of little decisional value in most cases, because 90% of all abortions are performed during the first trimester[7] when fetal age has less relevance than when the fetus nears viability. Nor can the information *922 required by the statute be justified as relevant to any \"philosophic\" or \"social\" argument, ante, at 872, either favoring or disfavoring the abortion decision in a particular case. In light of all of these facts, I conclude that the information requirements in  3205(a)(1)(ii) and  3205(a)(2)(i)(iii) do not serve a useful purpose and thus constitute an unnecessary and therefore undueburden on the woman's constitutional liberty to decide to terminate her pregnancy.\n\nAccordingly, while I disagree with Parts IV, VB, and VD of the joint opinion,[8] I join the remainder of the Court's opinion.Justice Blackmun, concurring in part, concurring in the judgment in part, and dissenting in part.I join Parts I, II, III, VA, VC, and VI of the joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, ante.\n\nThree years ago, in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490 (1989), four Members of this Court appeared poised to \"cas[t] into darkness the hopes and visions of every woman in this country\" who had come to believe that the Constitution guaranteed her the right to reproductive choice. Id., at 557 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). See id.,  at 499 (plurality opinion of Rehnquist, C. J., joined by White and Kennedy, JJ.); id., at 532 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). All that remained between the promise of Roe and the darkness of the plurality was a single, flickering flame. Decisions since Webster gave little reason to hope that this flame would cast much light. See, e. g., Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 524 (1990) (Blackmun, J., dissenting). But now, just when so many expected the darkness to fall, the flame has grown bright.\n\n*923 I do not underestimate the significance of today's joint opinion. Yet I remain steadfast in my belief that the right to reproductive choice is entitled to the full protection afforded by this Court before Webster. And I fear for the darkness as four Justices anxiously await the single vote necessary to extinguish the light.IMake no mistake, the joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter is an act of personal courage and constitutional principle. In contrast to previous decisions in which Justices O'Connor and Kennedy postponed reconsideration of Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), the authors of the joint opinion today join Justice Stevens and me in concluding that \"the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed.\" Ante, at 846. In brief, five Members of this Court today recognize that \"the Constitution protects a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy in its early stages.\" Ante, at 844.\n\nA fervent view of individual liberty and the force of stare decisis have led the Court to this conclusion. Ante, at 853. Today a majority reaffirms that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment establishes \"a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter,\" ante, at 847 a realm whose outer limits cannot be determined by interpretations of the Constitution that focus only on the specific practices of States at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. See ante, at 848-849. Included within this realm of liberty is \"`the right of the individual, married or single, to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.' \" Ante, at 851, quoting Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 453 (1972) (emphasis in original). \"These matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the *924 liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Ante, at 851 (emphasis added). Finally, the Court today recognizes that in the case of abortion, \"the liberty of the woman is at stake in a sense unique to the human condition and so unique to the law. The mother who carries a child to full term is subject to anxieties, to physical constraints, to pain that only she must bear.\" Ante, at 852.\n\nThe Court's reaffirmation of Roe `s central holding is also based on the force of stare decisis. \"[N]o erosion of principle going to liberty or personal autonomy has left Roe `s central holding a doctrinal remnant; Roe portends no developments at odds with other precedent for the analysis of personal liberty; and no changes of fact have rendered viability more or less appropriate as the point at which the balance of interests tips.\" Ante, at 860-861. Indeed, the Court acknowledges that Roe `s limitation on state power could not be removed \"without serious inequity to those who have relied upon it or significant damage to the stability of the society governed by it.\" Ante, at 855. In the 19 years since Roe  was decided, that case has shaped more than reproductive planning\"[a]n entire generation has come of age free to assume Roe `s concept of liberty in defining the capacity of women to act in society, and to make reproductive decisions.\" Ante, at 860. The Court understands that, having \"call[ed] the contending sides . . . to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution,\" ante, at 867, a decision to overrule Roe \"would seriously weaken the Court's capacity to exercise the judicial power and to function as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated to the rule of law.\" Ante, at 865. What has happened today should serve as a model for future Justices and a warning to all who have tried to turn this Court into yet another political branch.\n\nIn striking down the Pennsylvania statute's spousal notification requirement, the Court has established a framework *925 for evaluating abortion regulations that responds to the social context of women facing issues of reproductive choice.[1] In determining the burden imposed by the challenged regulation, the Court inquires whether the regulation's \"purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.\" Ante, at 878 (emphasis added). The Court reaffirms: \"The proper focus of constitutional inquiry is the group for whom the law is a restriction, not the group for whom the law is irrelevant.\" Ante, at 894. Looking at this group, the Court inquires, based on expert testimony, empirical studies, and common sense, whether \"in a large fraction of the cases in which [the restriction] is relevant, it will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion.\" Ante, at 895. \"A statute with this purpose is invalid because the means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it.\" Ante, at 877. And in applying its test, the Court remains sensitive to the unique role of women in the decision making process. Whatever may have been the practice when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, the Court observes, \"[w]omen do not lose their constitutionally protected liberty when they marry. The Constitution protects all individuals, male or female, married or unmarried, from the abuse of governmental power, even where that power is employed for the supposed benefit of a member of the individual's family.\" Ante, at 898.[2]*926 Lastly, while I believe that the joint opinion errs in failing to invalidate the other regulations, I am pleased that the joint opinion has not ruled out the possibility that these regulations may be shown to impose an unconstitutional burden. The joint opinion makes clear that its specific holdings are based on the insufficiency of the record before it. See, e. g., ante, at 885-886. I am confident that in the future evidence will be produced to show that \"in a large fraction of the cases in which [these regulations are] relevant, [they] will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion.\" Ante, at 895.IIToday, no less than yesterday, the Constitution and decisions of this Court require that a State's abortion restrictions be subjected to the strictest judicial scrutiny. Our precedents and the joint opinion's principles require us to subject all non-de-minimis abortion regulations to strict scrutiny. Under this standard, the Pennsylvania statute's provisions requiring content-based counseling, a 24-hour delay, informed parental consent, and reporting of abortionrelated information must be invalidated.AThe Court today reaffirms the long recognized rights of privacy and bodily integrity. As early as 1891, the Court held, \"[n]o right is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others . . . .\" Union Pacific R. Co. v. Botsford, 141 U. S. 250, 251 (1891). Throughout this century, this Court also has held that the fundamental right of privacy protects citizens against governmental intrusion *927 in such intimate family matters as procreation, childrearing, marriage, and contraceptive choice. See ante, at 847-849. These cases embody the principle that personal decisions that profoundly affect bodily integrity, identity, and destiny should be largely beyond the reach of government. Eisenstadt, 405 U. S., at 453. In Roe v. Wade, this Court correctly applied these principles to a woman's right to choose abortion.\n\nState restrictions on abortion violate a woman's right of privacy in two ways. First, compelled continuation of a pregnancy infringes upon a woman's right to bodily integrity by imposing substantial physical intrusions and significant risks of physical harm. During pregnancy, women experience dramatic physical changes and a wide range of health consequences. Labor and delivery pose additional health risks and physical demands. In short, restrictive abortion laws force women to endure physical invasions far more substantial than those this Court has held to violate the constitutional principle of bodily integrity in other contexts. See, e. g., Winston v. Lee, 470 U. S. 753 (1985) (invalidating surgical removal of bullet from murder suspect); Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952) (invalidating stomach pumping).[3]\n\nFurther, when the State restricts a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy, it deprives a woman of the right to make her own decision about reproduction and family planningcritical life choices that this Court long has deemed central to the right to privacy. The decision to terminate or continue a pregnancy has no less an impact on a woman's life than decisions about contraception or marriage. 410 U. S., *928 at 153. Because motherhood has a dramatic impact on a woman's educational prospects, employment opportunities, and self-determination, restrictive abortion laws deprive her of basic control over her life. For these reasons, \"the decision whether or not to beget or bear a child\" lies at \"the very heart of this cluster of constitutionally protected choices.\" Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S. 678, 685 (1977).\n\nA State's restrictions on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy also implicate constitutional guarantees of gender equality. State restrictions on abortion compel women to continue pregnancies they otherwise might terminate. By restricting the right to terminate pregnancies, the State conscripts women's bodies into its service, forcing women to continue their pregnancies, suffer the pains of childbirth, and in most instances, provide years of maternal care. The State does not compensate women for their services; instead, it assumes that they owe this duty as a matter of course. This assumptionthat women can simply be forced to accept the \"natural\" status and incidents of motherhoodappears to rest upon a conception of women's role that has triggered the protection of the Equal Protection Clause. See, e. g., Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724-726 (1982); Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 198-199 (1976).[4] The joint opinion recognizes that these assumptions about women's place in society \"are no longer consistent with our *929 understanding of the family, the individual, or the Constitution.\" Ante, at 897.BThe Court has held that limitations on the right of privacy are permissible only if they survive \"strict\" constitutional scrutinythat is, only if the governmental entity imposing the restriction can demonstrate that the limitation is both necessary and narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest. Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, 485 (1965). We have applied this principle specifically in the context of abortion regulations. Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S., at 155.[5]Roe implemented these principles through a framework that was designed \"to ensure that the woman's right to choose not become so subordinate to the State's interest in promoting fetal life that her choice exists in theory but not in fact,\" ante, at 872. Roe identified two relevant state interests: \"an interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman\" and an interest in \"protecting the potentiality of human life.\" 410 U. S., at 162. With respect to the State's interest in the health of the mother, \"the `compelling' point . . . is at approximately the end of the first trimester,\" because it is at that point that the mortality rate in abortion approaches that in childbirth. Id., at 163. With respect to the State's interest in potential life, \"the `compelling' point is at viability,\" because it is at that point that the *930 fetus \"presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother's womb.\" Ibid. In order to fulfill the requirement of narrow tailoring, \"the State is obligated to make a reasonable effort to limit the effect of its regulations to the period in the trimester during which its health interest will be furthered.\" Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 434 (1983).\n\nIn my view, application of this analytical framework is no less warranted than when it was approved by seven Members of this Court in Roe. Strict scrutiny of state limitations on reproductive choice still offers the most secure protection of the woman's right to make her own reproductive decisions, free from state coercion. No majority of this Court has ever agreed upon an alternative approach. The factual premises of the trimester framework have not been undermined, see Webster, 492 U. S., at 553 (Blackmun, J., dissenting), and the Roe framework is far more administrable, and far less manipulable, than the \"undue burden\" standard adopted by the joint opinion.\n\nNonetheless, three criticisms of the trimester framework continue to be uttered. First, the trimester framework is attacked because its key elements do not appear in the text of the Constitution. My response to this attack remains the same as it was in Webster:\"Were this a true concern, we would have to abandon most of our constitutional jurisprudence. [T]he `critical elements' of countless constitutional doctrines nowhere appear in the Constitution's text . . . . The Constitution makes no mention, for example, of the First Amendment's `actual malice' standard for proving certain libels, see New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964).. . . Similarly, the Constitution makes no mention of the rational-basis test, or the specific verbal formulations of intermediate and strict scrutiny by which this Court evaluates claims under the Equal Protection Clause. The reason is simple. Like the Roe framework, these *931 tests or standards are not, and do not purport to be, rights protected by the Constitution. Rather, they are judge-made methods for evaluating and measuring the strength and scope of constitutional rights or for balancing the constitutional rights of individuals against the competing interests of government.\" Id., at 548.The second criticism is that the framework more closely resembles a regulatory code than a body of constitutional doctrine. Again, my answer remains the same as in Webster:\"[I]f this were a true and genuine concern, we would have to abandon vast areas of our constitutional jurisprudence. . . . Are [the distinctions entailed in the trimester framework] any finer, or more `regulatory,' than the distinctions we have often drawn in our First Amendment jurisprudence, where, for example, we have held that a `release time' program permitting publicschool students to leave school grounds during school hours to receive religious instruction does not violate the Establishment Clause, even though a release-time program permitting religious instruction on school grounds does violate the Clause? Compare Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306 (1952), with Illinois ex rel. Mc- Collum v. Board of Education of School Dist. No. 71, Champaign County, 333 U. S. 203 (1948). . . . Similarly, in a Sixth Amendment case, the Court held that although an overnight ban on attorney-client communication violated the constitutionally guaranteed right to counsel, Geders v. United States, 425 U. S. 80 (1976), that right was not violated when a trial judge separated a defendant from his lawyer during a 15-minute recess after the defendant's direct testimony. Perry v. Leeke, 488 U. S. 272 (1989).\"That numerous constitutional doctrines result in narrow differentiations between similar circumstances does *932 not mean that this Court has abandoned adjudication in favor of regulation.\" Id., at 549-550.The final, and more genuine, criticism of the trimester framework is that it fails to find the State's interest in potential human life compelling throughout pregnancy. No Member of this Courtnor for that matter, the Solicitor General, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 42has ever questioned our holding in Roe that an abortion is not \"the termination of life entitled to Fourteenth Amendment protection.\" 410 U. S., at 159. Accordingly, a State's interest in protecting fetal life is not grounded in the Constitution. Nor, consistent with our Establishment Clause, can it be a theological or sectarian interest. See Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 778 (1986) (Stevens, J., concurring). It is, instead, a legitimate interest grounded in humanitarian or pragmatic concerns. See ante, at 914-915 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\nBut while a State has \"legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting the health of the woman and the life of the fetus that may become a child,\" ante, at 846, legitimate interests are not enough. To overcome the burden of strict scrutiny, the interests must be compelling. The question then is how best to accommodate the State's interest in potential human life with the constitutional liberties of pregnant women. Again, I stand by the views I expressed in Webster:\"I remain convinced, as six other Members of this Court 16 years ago were convinced, that the Roe framework, and the viability standard in particular, fairly, sensibly, and effectively functions to safeguard the constitutional liberties of pregnant women while recognizing and accommodating the State's interest in potential human life. The viability line reflects the biological facts and truths of fetal development; it marks that threshold moment prior to which a fetus cannot survive separate from the *933 woman and cannot reasonably and objectively be regarded as a subject of rights or interests distinct from, or paramount to, those of the pregnant woman. At the same time, the viability standard takes account of the undeniable fact that as the fetus evolves into its postnatal form, and as it loses its dependence on the uterine environment, the State's interest in the fetus' potential human life, and in fostering a regard for human life in general, becomes compelling. As a practical matter, because viability follows `quickening'the point at which a woman feels movement in her womband because viability occurs no earlier than 23 weeks gestational age, it establishes an easily applicable standard for regulating abortion while providing a pregnant woman ample time to exercise her fundamental right with her responsible physician to terminate her pregnancy.\" 492 U. S., at 553-554.[6]Roe`s trimester framework does not ignore the State's interest in prenatal life. Like Justice Stevens, ante, at 916, I agree that the State may take steps to ensure that a woman's choice \"is thoughtful and informed,\" ante, at 872, and that \"States are free to enact laws to provide a reasonable framework for a woman to make a decision that has such profound and lasting meaning.\" Ante, at 873. But\"[s]erious questions arise . . . when a State attempts to persuade the woman to choose childbirth over abortion. Ante, at 878. Decisional autonomy must limit the State's power to inject into a woman's most personal deliberations its own views of what is best. The State may promote its preferences by funding childbirth, by creating and maintaining alternatives to abortion, and by espousing the virtues of family; but it must respect *934 the individual's freedom to make such judgments.\" Ante, at 916 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (internal quotation marks omitted).As the joint opinion recognizes, \"the means chosen by the State to further the interest in potential life must be calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it.\" Ante, at 877.\n\nIn sum, Roe `s requirement of strict scrutiny as implemented through a trimester framework should not be disturbed. No other approach has gained a majority, and no other is more protective of the woman's fundamental right. Lastly, no other approach properly accommodates the woman's constitutional right with the State's legitimate interests.CApplication of the strict scrutiny standard results in the invalidation of all the challenged provisions. Indeed, as this Court has invalidated virtually identical provisions in prior cases, stare decisis requires that we again strike them down.\n\nThis Court has upheld informed- and written-consent requirements only where the State has demonstrated that they genuinely further important health-related state concerns. See Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 65-67 (1976). A State may not, under the guise of securing informed consent, \"require the delivery of information `designed to influence the woman's informed choice between abortion or childbirth.' \" Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 760, quoting Akron, 462 U. S., at 443-444. Rigid requirements that a specific body of information be imparted to a woman in all cases, regardless of the needs of the patient, improperly intrude upon the discretion of the pregnant woman's physician and thereby impose an \"`undesired and uncomfortable straitjacket.' \" Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 762, quoting Danforth, 428 U. S., at 67, n. 8.\n\nMeasured against these principles, some aspects of the Pennsylvania informed-consent scheme are unconstitutional. *935 While it is unobjectionable for the Commonwealth to require that the patient be informed of the nature of the procedure, the health risks of the abortion and of childbirth, and the probable gestational age of the unborn child, compare Pa. Cons. Stat.  3205(a)(i)-(iii) (1990) with Akron, 462 U. S., at 446, n. 37, I remain unconvinced that there is a vital state need for insisting that the information be provided by a physician rather than a counselor. Id., at 448. The District Court found that the physician-only requirement necessarily would increase costs to the plaintiff clinics, costs that undoubtedly would be passed on to patients. And because trained women counselors are often more understanding than physicians, and generally have more time to spend with patients, see App. 366-387, the physician-only disclosure requirement is not narrowly tailored to serve the Commonwealth's interest in protecting maternal health.\n\nSections 3205(a)(2)(i)-(iii) of the Act further requires that the physician or a qualified nonphysician inform the woman that printed materials are available from the Commonwealth that describe the fetus and provide information about medical assistance for childbirth, information about child support from the father, and a list of agencies offering adoption and other services as alternatives to abortion. Thornburgh invalidated biased patient-counseling requirements virtually identical to the one at issue here. What we said of those requirements fully applies in these cases:\"[T]he listing of agencies in the printed Pennsylvania form presents serious problems; it contains names of agencies that well may be out of step with the needs of the particular woman and thus places the physician in an awkward position and infringes upon his or her professional responsibilities. Forcing the physician or counselor to present the materials and the list to the woman makes him or her in effect an agent of the State in treating the woman and places his or her imprimatur upon both the materials and the list. All this is, or *936 comes close to being, state medicine imposed upon the woman, not the professional medical guidance she seeks, and it officially structuresas it obviously was intended to dothe dialogue between the woman and her physician.\"The requirements . . . that the woman be advised that medical assistance benefits may be available, and that the father is responsible for financial assistance in the support of the child similarly are poorly disguised elements of discouragement for the abortion decision. Much of this . . . , for many patients, would be irrelevant and inappropriate. For a patient with a life-threatening pregnancy, the `information' in its very rendition may be cruel as well as destructive of the physician-patient relationship. As any experienced social worker or other counselor knows, theoretical financial responsibility often does not equate with fulfillment . . . . Under the guise of informed consent, the Act requires the dissemination of information that is not relevant to such consent, and, thus, it advances no legitimate state interest.\" 476 U. S., at 762-763 (citation omitted).\"This type of compelled information is the antithesis of informed consent,\" id., at 764, and goes far beyond merely describing the general subject matter relevant to the woman's decision. \"That the Commonwealth does not, and surely would not, compel similar disclosure of every possible peril of necessary surgery or of simple vaccination, reveals the anti-abortion character of the statute and its real purpose.\" Ibid.[7]*937 The 24-hour waiting period following the provision of the foregoing information is also clearly unconstitutional. The District Court found that the mandatory 24-hour delay could lead to delays in excess of 24 hours, thus increasing health risks, and that it would require two visits to the abortion provider, thereby increasing travel time, exposure to further harassment, and financial cost. Finally, the District Court found that the requirement would pose especially significant burdens on women living in rural areas and those women that have difficulty explaining their whereabouts. 744 F. Supp. 1323, 1378-1379 (ED Pa. 1990). In Akron this Court invalidated a similarly arbitrary or inflexible waiting period because, as here, it furthered no legitimate state interest.[8]\n\nAs Justice Stevens insightfully concludes, the mandatory delay rests either on outmoded or unacceptable assumptions about the decision making capacity of women or the belief that the decision to terminate the pregnancy is *938 presumptively wrong. Ante, at 918-919. The requirement that women consider this obvious and slanted information for an additional 24 hours contained in these provisions will only influence the woman's decision in improper ways. The vast majority of women will know this informationof the few that do not, it is less likely that their minds will be changed by this information than it will be either by the realization that the State opposes their choice or the need once again to endure abuse and harassment on return to the clinic.[9]\n\nExcept in the case of a medical emergency,  3206 requires a physician to obtain the informed consent of a parent or guardian before performing an abortion on an unemancipated minor or an incompetent woman. Based on evidence in the record, the District Court concluded that, in order to fulfill the informed-consent requirement, generally accepted medical principles would require an in-person visit by the parent to the facility. 744 F. Supp., at 1382. Although the Court \"has recognized that the State has somewhat broader authority to regulate the activities of children than of adults,\" the State nevertheless must demonstrate that there is a \"significant state interest in conditioning an abortion . . . that is not present in the case of an adult.\" Danforth, 428 U. S., at 74-75 (emphasis added). The requirement of an inperson visit would carry with it the risk of a delay of several days or possibly weeks, even where the parent is willing to consent. While the State has an interest in encouraging parental involvement in the minor's abortion decision,  3206 is not narrowly drawn to serve that interest.[10]*939 Finally, the Pennsylvania statute requires every facility performing abortions to report its activities to the Commonwealth. Pennsylvania contends that this requirement is valid under Danforth, in which this Court held that recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health and that properly respect a patient's confidentiality are permissible. Id., at 79-81. The Commonwealth attempts to justify its required reports on the ground that the public has a right to know how its tax dollars are spent. A regulation designed to inform the public about public expenditures does not further the Commonwealth's interest in protecting maternal health. Accordingly, such a regulation cannot justify a legally significant burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.\n\nThe confidential reports concerning the identities and medical judgment of physicians involved in abortions at first glance may seem valid, given the Commonwealth's interest in maternal health and enforcement of the Act. The District Court found, however, that, notwithstanding the confidentiality protections, many physicians, particularly those who have previously discontinued performing abortions because of harassment, would refuse to refer patients to abortion clinics if their names were to appear on these reports. 744 F. Supp., at 1392. The Commonwealth has failed to show that the name of the referring physician either adds to the pool of scientific knowledge concerning abortion or is reasonably related to the Commonwealth's interest in maternal health. I therefore agree with the District Court's conclusion that the confidential reporting requirements are unconstitutional *940 insofar as they require the name of the referring physician and the basis for his or her medical judgment.\n\nIn sum, I would affirm the judgment in No. 91-902 and reverse the judgment in No. 91-744 and remand the cases for further proceedings.IIIAt long last, The Chief Justice and those who have joined him admit it. Gone are the contentions that the issue need not be (or has not been) considered. There, on the first page, for all to see, is what was expected: \"We believe that Roe was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to stare decisis in constitutional cases.\" Post, at 944. If there is much reason to applaud the advances made by the joint opinion today, there is far more to fear from The Chief Justice's opinion.\n\nThe Chief Justice's criticism of Roe follows from his stunted conception of individual liberty. While recognizing that the Due Process Clause protects more than simple physical liberty, he then goes on to construe this Court's personalliberty cases as establishing only a laundry list of particular rights, rather than a principled account of how these particular rights are grounded in a more general right of privacy. Post, at 951. This constricted view is reinforced by The Chief Justice's exclusive reliance on tradition as a source of fundamental rights. He argues that the record in favor of a right to abortion is no stronger than the record in Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110 (1989), where the plurality found no fundamental right to visitation privileges by an adulterous father, or in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986), where the Court found no fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy, or in a case involving the \"`firing [of] a gun . . . into another person's body.' \" Post, at 951-952. In The Chief Justice's world, a woman considering whether to terminate a pregnancy is entitled to no more protection than adulterers, murderers, and so-called sexual *941 deviates.[11] Given The Chief Justice's exclusive reliance on tradition, people using contraceptives seem the next likely candidate for his list of outcasts.\n\nEven more shocking than The Chief Justice's cramped notion of individual liberty is his complete omission of any discussion of the effects that compelled childbirth and motherhood have on women's lives. The only expression of concern with women's health is purely instrumentalfor The Chief Justice, only women's psychological health is a concern, and only to the extent that he assumes that every woman who decides to have an abortion does so without serious consideration of the moral implications of her decision. Post, at 967-968. In short, The Chief Justice's view of the State's compelling interest in maternal health has less to do with health than it does with compelling women to be maternal.\n\nNor does The Chief Justice give any serious consideration to the doctrine of stare decisis. For The Chief Justice, the facts that gave rise to Roe are surprisingly simple: \"women become pregnant, there is a point somewhere, depending on medical technology, where a fetus becomes viable, and women give birth to children.\" Post, at 955. This characterization of the issue thus allows The Chief Justice quickly to discard the joint opinion's reliance argument by asserting that \"reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of\" a decision overruling Roe. Post, at 956 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe Chief Justice's narrow conception of individual liberty and stare decisis leads him to propose the same standard of review proposed by the plurality in Webster. \"States may regulate abortion procedures in ways rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 491 (1955); cf. Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 651-653 (1972).\" Post, at 966. The *942 Chief Justice then further weakens the test by providing an insurmountable requirement for facial challenges: Petitioners must \"`show that no set of circumstances exists under which the [provision] would be valid.' \" Post, at 973, quoting Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S., at 514. In short, in his view, petitioners must prove that the statute cannot constitutionally be applied to anyone. Finally, in applying his standard to the spousal-notification provision, The Chief Justice contends that the record lacks any \"hard evidence\" to support the joint opinion's contention that a \"large fraction\" of women who prefer not to notify their husbands involve situations of battered women and unreported spousal assault. Post, at 974, n. 2. Yet throughout the explication of his standard, The Chief Justice never explains what hard evidence is, how large a fraction is required, or how a battered woman is supposed to pursue an as-applied challenge.\n\nUnder his standard, States can ban abortion if that ban is rationally related to a legitimate state interesta standard which the United States calls \"deferential, but not toothless.\" Yet when pressed at oral argument to describe the teeth, the best protection that the Solicitor General could offer to women was that a prohibition, enforced by criminal penalties, with no exception for the life of the mother, \"could raise very serious questions.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 48. Perhaps, the Solicitor General offered, the failure to include an exemption for the life of the mother would be \"arbitrary and capricious.\" Id., at 49. If, as The Chief Justice contends, the undue burden test is made out of whole cloth, the so-called \"arbitrary and capricious\" limit is the Solicitor General's \"new clothes.\"\n\nEven if it is somehow \"irrational\" for a State to require a woman to risk her life for her child, what protection is offered for women who become pregnant through rape or incest? Is there anything arbitrary or capricious about a *943 State's prohibiting the sins of the father from being visited upon his offspring?[12]\n\nBut, we are reassured, there is always the protection of the democratic process. While there is much to be praised about our democracy, our country since its founding has recognized that there are certain fundamental liberties that are not to be left to the whims of an election. A woman's right to reproductive choice is one of those fundamental liberties. Accordingly, that liberty need not seek refuge at the ballot box.IVIn one sense, the Court's approach is worlds apart from that of The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia. And yet, in another sense, the distance between the two approaches is shortthe distance is but a single vote.\n\nI am 83 years old. I cannot remain on this Court forever, and when I do step down, the confirmation process for my successor well may focus on the issue before us today. That, I regret, may be exactly where the choice between the two worlds will be made.\n\n*944Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice White, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.The joint opinion, following its newly minted variation on stare decisis, retains the outer shell of Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), but beats a wholesale retreat from the substance of that case. We believe that Roe was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to stare decisis in constitutional cases. We would adopt the approach of the plurality in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490 (1989), and uphold the challenged provisions of the Pennsylvania statute in their entirety.IIn ruling on this litigation below, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit first observed that \"this appeal does not directly implicate Roe; this case involves the regulation of abortions rather than their outright prohibition.\" 947 F. 2d 682, 687 (1991). Accordingly, the court directed its attention to the question of the standard of review for abortion regulations. In attempting to settle on the correct standard, however, the court confronted the confused state of this Court's abortion jurisprudence. After considering the several opinions in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, supra, and Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417 (1990), the Court of Appeals concluded that Justice O'Connor's \"undue burden\" test was controlling, as that was the narrowest ground on which we had upheld recent abortion regulations. 947 F. 2d, at 693-697 (\"When a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds\" (quoting Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 193 (1977) (internal quotation marks omitted))). Applying this standard, the Court of Appeals upheld all of the challenged regulations except the one *945 requiring a woman to notify her spouse of an intended abortion.\n\nIn arguing that this Court should invalidate each of the provisions at issue, petitioners insist that we reaffirm our decision in Roe v. Wade, supra, in which we held unconstitutional a Texas statute making it a crime to procure an abortion except to save the life of the mother.[1] We agree with the Court of Appeals that our decision in Roe is not directly implicated by the Pennsylvania statute, which does not prohibit, but simply regulates, abortion. But, as the Court of Appeals found, the state of our post-Roe decisional law dealing with the regulation of abortion is confusing and uncertain, indicating that a reexamination of that line of cases is in order. Unfortunately for those who must apply this Court's decisions, the reexamination undertaken today leaves the Court no less divided than beforehand. Although they reject the trimester framework that formed the underpinning of Roe, Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter adopt a revised undue burden standard to analyze the challenged regulations. We conclude, however, that such an outcome is an unjustified constitutional compromise, one which leaves the Court in a position to closely scrutinize all types of abortion regulations despite the fact that it lacks the power to do so under the Constitution.\n\nIn Roe, the Court opined that the State \"does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protecting the health of the pregnant woman, . . . and that it has still another important and legitimate interest in protecting *946 the potentiality of human life.\" 410 U. S., at 162 (emphasis omitted). In the companion case of Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179 (1973), the Court referred to its conclusion in Roe \"that a pregnant woman does not have an absolute constitutional right to an abortion on her demand.\" 410 U. S., at 189. But while the language and holdings of these cases appeared to leave States free to regulate abortion procedures in a variety of ways, later decisions based on them have found considerably less latitude for such regulations than might have been expected.\n\nFor example, after Roe, many States have sought to protect their young citizens by requiring that a minor seeking an abortion involve her parents in the decision. Some States have simply required notification of the parents, while others have required a minor to obtain the consent of her parents. In a number of decisions, however, the Court has substantially limited the States in their ability to impose such requirements. With regard to parental notice requirements, we initially held that a State could require a minor to notify her parents before proceeding with an abortion. H. L. v. Matheson, 450 U. S. 398, 407-410 (1981). Recently, however, we indicated that a State's ability to impose a notice requirement actually depends on whether it requires notice of one or both parents. We concluded that although the Constitution might allow a State to demand that notice be given to one parent prior to an abortion, it may not require that similar notice be given to two parents, unless the State incorporates a judicial bypass procedure in that two-parent requirement. Hodgson v. Minnesota, supra.\n\nWe have treated parental consent provisions even more harshly. Three years after Roe, we invalidated a Missouri regulation requiring that an unmarried woman under the age of 18 obtain the consent of one of her parents before proceeding with an abortion. We held that our abortion jurisprudence prohibited the State from imposing such a \"blanket provision. . . requiring the consent of a parent.\" Planned Parenthood *947 of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 74 (1976). In Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622 (1979), the Court struck down a similar Massachusetts parental consent statute. A majority of the Court indicated, however, that a State could constitutionally require parental consent, if it alternatively allowed a pregnant minor to obtain an abortion without parental consent by showing either that she was mature enough to make her own decision, or that the abortion would be in her best interests. See id., at 643-644 (plurality opinion); id., at 656-657 (White, J., dissenting). In light of Bellotti, we have upheld one parental consent regulation which incorporated a judicial bypass option we viewed as sufficient, see Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476 (1983), but have invalidated another because of our belief that the judicial procedure did not satisfy the dictates of Bellotti, see Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 439-442 (1983). We have never had occasion, as we have in the parental notice context, to further parse our parental consent jurisprudence into oneparent and two-parent components.\n\nIn Roe, the Court observed that certain States recognized the right of the father to participate in the abortion decision in certain circumstances. Because neither Roe nor Doe involved the assertion of any paternal right, the Court expressly stated that the case did not disturb the validity of regulations that protected such a right. Roe v. Wade, supra, at 165, n. 67. But three years later, in Danforth, the Court extended its abortion jurisprudence and held that a State could not require that a woman obtain the consent of her spouse before proceeding with an abortion. Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S., at 69-71.\n\nStates have also regularly tried to ensure that a woman's decision to have an abortion is an informed and wellconsidered one. In Danforth, we upheld a requirement that a woman sign a consent form prior to her abortion, and observed that \"it is desirable and imperative that [the decision] *948 be made with full knowledge of its nature and consequences.\" Id., at 67. Since that case, however, we have twice invalidated state statutes designed to impart such knowledge to a woman seeking an abortion. In Akron, we held unconstitutional a regulation requiring a physician to inform a woman seeking an abortion of the status of her pregnancy, the development of her fetus, the date of possible viability, the complications that could result from an abortion, and the availability of agencies providing assistance and information with respect to adoption and childbirth. Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, supra, at 442-445. More recently, in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747 (1986), we struck down a more limited Pennsylvania regulation requiring that a woman be informed of the risks associated with the abortion procedure and the assistance available to her if she decided to proceed with her pregnancy, because we saw the compelled information as \"the antithesis of informed consent.\" Id., at 764. Even when a State has sought only to provide information that, in our view, was consistent with the Roe framework, we concluded that the State could not require that a physician furnish the information, but instead had to alternatively allow nonphysician counselors to provide it. Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 462 U. S., at 448-449. In Akron as well, we went further and held that a State may not require a physician to wait 24 hours to perform an abortion after receiving the consent of a woman. Although the State sought to ensure that the woman's decision was carefully considered, the Court concluded that the Constitution forbade the State to impose any sort of delay. Id., at 449-451.\n\nWe have not allowed States much leeway to regulate even the actual abortion procedure. Although a State can require that second-trimester abortions be performed in outpatient clinics, see Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U. S. 506 (1983), we concluded in Akron and Ashcroft that a State could not *949 require that such abortions be performed only in hospitals. See Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, supra, at 437-439; Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, supra, at 481-482. Despite the fact that Roe expressly allowed regulation after the first trimester in furtherance of maternal health, \"`present medical knowledge,' \" in our view, could not justify such a hospitalization requirement under the trimester framework. Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, supra, at 437 (quoting Roe v. Wade, supra, at 163). And in Danforth, the Court held that Missouri could not outlaw the saline amniocentesis method of abortion, concluding that the Missouri Legislature had \"failed to appreciate and to consider several significant facts\" in making its decision. 428 U. S., at 77.\n\nAlthough Roe allowed state regulation after the point of viability to protect the potential life of the fetus, the Court subsequently rejected attempts to regulate in this manner. In Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379 (1979), the Court struck down a statute that governed the determination of viability. Id., at 390-397. In the process, we made clear that the trimester framework incorporated only one definition of viabilityoursas we forbade States to decide that a certain objective indicator\"be it weeks of gestation or fetal weight or any other single factor\"should govern the definition of viability. Id., at 389. In that same case, we also invalidated a regulation requiring a physician to use the abortion technique offering the best chance for fetal survival when performing postviability abortions. See id., at 397-401; see also Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 768-769 (invalidating a similar regulation). In Thornburgh, the Court struck down Pennsylvania's requirement that a second physician be present at post viability abortions to help preserve the health of the unborn child, on the ground that it did not incorporate a sufficient medical emergency exception. Id., at 769-771. Regulations governing the treatment of aborted fetuses have *950 met a similar fate. In Akron, we invalidated a provision requiring physicians performing abortions to \"insure that the remains of the unborn child are disposed of in a humane and sanitary manner.\" 462 U. S., at 451 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nDissents in these cases expressed the view that the Court was expanding upon Roe in imposing ever greater restrictions on the States. See Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 783 (Burger, C. J., dissenting) (\"The extent to which the Court has departed from the limitations expressed in Roe is readily apparent\"); id., at 814 (White, J., dissenting) (\"[T]he majority indiscriminately strikes down statutory provisions that in no way contravene the right recognized in Roe \"). And, when confronted with state regulations of this type in past years, the Court has become increasingly more divided: The three most recent abortion cases have not commanded a Court opinion. See Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502 (1990); Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417 (1990); Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490 (1989).\n\nThe task of the Court of Appeals in the present cases was obviously complicated by this confusion and uncertainty. Following Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188 (1977), it concluded that in light of Webster and Hodgson, the strict scrutiny standard enunciated in Roe was no longer applicable, and that the \"undue burden\" standard adopted by Justice O'Connor was the governing principle. This state of confusion and disagreement warrants reexamination of the \"fundamental right\" accorded to a woman's decision to abort a fetus in Roe, with its concomitant requirement that any state regulation of abortion survive \"strict scrutiny.\" See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827-828 (1991) (observing that reexamination of constitutional decisions is appropriate when those decisions have generated uncertainty and failed to provide clear guidance, because \"correction through legislative *951 action is practically impossible\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 546-547, 557 (1985).\n\nWe have held that a liberty interest protected under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment will be deemed fundamental if it is \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\" Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325 (1937). Three years earlier, in Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97 (1934), we referred to a \"principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\" Id., at 105; see also Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, 122 (1989) (plurality opinion) (citing the language from Snyder). These expressions are admittedly not precise, but our decisions implementing this notion of \"fundamental\" rights do not afford any more elaborate basis on which to base such a classification.\n\nIn construing the phrase \"liberty\" incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, we have recognized that its meaning extends beyond freedom from physical restraint. In Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 (1925), we held that it included a parent's right to send a child to private school; in Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923), we held that it included a right to teach a foreign language in a parochial school. Building on these cases, we have held that the term \"liberty\" includes a right to marry, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); a right to procreate, Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942); and a right to use contraceptives, Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972). But a reading of these opinions makes clear that they do not endorse any all-encompassing \"right of privacy.\"\n\nIn Roe v. Wade, the Court recognized a \"guarantee of personal privacy\" which \"is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.\" 410 U. S., at 152-153. We are now of the view that, in terming this right fundamental, the Court in Roe read the earlier *952 opinions upon which it based its decision much too broadly. Unlike marriage, procreation, and contraception, abortion \"involves the purposeful termination of a potential life.\" Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 325 (1980). The abortion decision must therefore \"be recognized as sui generis, different in kind from the others that the Court has protected under the rubric of personal or family privacy and autonomy.\" Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, supra, at 792 (White, J., dissenting). One cannot ignore the fact that a woman is not isolated in her pregnancy, and that the decision to abort necessarily involves the destruction of a fetus. See Michael H. v. Gerald D., supra, at 124, n. 4 (To look \"at the act which is assertedly the subject of a liberty interest in isolation from its effect upon other people [is] like inquiring whether there is a liberty interest in firing a gun where the case at hand happens to involve its discharge into another person's body\").\n\nNor do the historical traditions of the American people support the view that the right to terminate one's pregnancy is \"fundamental.\" The common law which we inherited from England made abortion after \"quickening\" an offense. At the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, statutory prohibitions or restrictions on abortion were commonplace; in 1868, at least 28 of the then-37 States and 8 Territories had statutes banning or limiting abortion. J. Mohr, Abortion in America 200 (1978). By the turn of the century virtually every State had a law prohibiting or restricting abortion on its books. By the middle of the present century, a liberalization trend had set in. But 21 of the restrictive abortion laws in effect in 1868 were still in effect in 1973 when Roe was decided, and an overwhelming majority of the States prohibited abortion unless necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother. Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S., at 139-140; id., at 176-177, n. 2 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting). On this record, it can scarcely be said that any deeply rooted tradition of relatively unrestricted abortion in our history *953 supported the classification of the right to abortion as \"fundamental\" under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nWe think, therefore, both in view of this history and of our decided cases dealing with substantive liberty under the Due Process Clause, that the Court was mistaken in Roe when it classified a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy as a \"fundamental right\" that could be abridged only in a manner which withstood \"strict scrutiny.\" In so concluding, we repeat the observation made in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986):\"Nor are we inclined to take a more expansive view of our authority to discover new fundamental rights imbedded in the Due Process Clause. The Court is most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or design of the Constitution.\" Id., at 194.We believe that the sort of constitutionally imposed abortion code of the type illustrated by our decisions following Roe is inconsistent \"with the notion of a Constitution cast in general terms, as ours is, and usually speaking in general principles, as ours does.\" Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S., at 518 (plurality opinion). The Court in Roe reached too far when it analogized the right to abort a fetus to the rights involved in Pierce, Meyer, Loving, and Griswold, and thereby deemed the right to abortion fundamental.IIThe joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter cannot bring itself to say that Roe was correct as an original matter, but the authors are of the view that \"the immediate question is not the soundness of Roe `s resolution of the issue, but the precedential force that must be accorded to its holding.\" Ante, at 871. Instead of claiming that Roe *954 was correct as a matter of original constitutional interpretation, the opinion therefore contains an elaborate discussion of stare decisis. This discussion of the principle of stare decisis appears to be almost entirely dicta, because the joint opinion does not apply that principle in dealing with Roe. Roe decided that a woman had a fundamental right to an abortion. The joint opinion rejects that view. Roe decided that abortion regulations were to be subjected to \"strict scrutiny\" and could be justified only in the light of \"compelling state interests.\" The joint opinion rejects that view. Ante, at 872-873; see Roe v. Wade, supra, at 162-164. Roe analyzed abortion regulation under a rigid trimester framework, a framework which has guided this Court's decision making for 19 years. The joint opinion rejects that framework. Ante, at 873.\n\nStare decisis is defined in Black's Law Dictionary as meaning \"to abide by, or adhere to, decided cases.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1406 (6th ed. 1990). Whatever the \"central holding\" of Roe that is left after the joint opinion finishes dissecting it is surely not the result of that principle. While purporting to adhere to precedent, the joint opinion instead revises it. Roe continues to exist, but only in the way a storefront on a western movie set exists: a mere facade to give the illusion of reality. Decisions following Roe, such as Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (1983), and Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747 (1986), are frankly overruled in part under the \"undue burden\" standard expounded in the joint opinion. Ante, at 881-884.\n\nIn our view, authentic principles of stare decisis do not require that any portion of the reasoning in Roe be kept intact. \"Stare decisis is not . . . a universal, inexorable command,\" especially in cases involving the interpretation of the Federal Constitution. Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 405 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). Erroneous decisions in such constitutional cases are uniquely durable, because correction through legislative action, save for *955 constitutional amendment, is impossible. It is therefore our duty to reconsider constitutional interpretations that \"depar[t] from a proper understanding\" of the Constitution. Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S., at 557; see United States v. Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 101 (1978) (\"`[I]n cases involving the Federal Constitution, . . . [t]he Court bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function'\" (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., supra, at 406-408 (Brandeis, J., dissenting))); Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 665 (1944). Our constitutional watch does not cease merely because we have spoken before on an issue; when it becomes clear that a prior constitutional interpretation is unsound we are obliged to reexamine the question. See, e. g., West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 642 (1943); Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 74-78 (1938).\n\nThe joint opinion discusses several stare decisis factors which, it asserts, point toward retaining a portion of Roe. Two of these factors are that the main \"factual underpinning\" of Roe has remained the same, and that its doctrinal foundation is no weaker now than it was in 1973. Ante, at 857-860. Of course, what might be called the basic facts which gave rise to Roe have remained the samewomen become pregnant, there is a point somewhere, depending on medical technology, where a fetus becomes viable, and women give birth to children. But this is only to say that the same facts which gave rise to Roe will continue to give rise to similar cases. It is not a reason, in and of itself, why those cases must be decided in the same incorrect manner as was the first case to deal with the question. And surely there is no requirement, in considering whether to depart from stare decisis in a constitutional case, that a decision be more wrong now than it was at the time it was rendered. If that were true, the most outlandish constitutional decision could survive *956 forever, based simply on the fact that it was no more outlandish later than it was when originally rendered.\n\nNor does the joint opinion faithfully follow this alleged requirement. The opinion frankly concludes that Roe and its progeny were wrong in failing to recognize that the State's interests in maternal health and in the protection of unborn human life exist throughout pregnancy. Ante, at 871-873. But there is no indication that these components of Roe are any more incorrect at this juncture than they were at its inception.\n\nThe joint opinion also points to the reliance interests involved in this context in its effort to explain why precedent must be followed for precedent's sake. Certainly it is true that where reliance is truly at issue, as in the case of judicial decisions that have formed the basis for private decisions, \"[c]onsiderations in favor of stare decisis are at their acme.\" Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S., at 828. But, as the joint opinion apparently agrees, ante, at 855-856, any traditional notion of reliance is not applicable here. The Court today cuts back on the protection afforded by Roe, and no one claims that this action defeats any reliance interest in the disavowed trimester framework. Similarly, reliance interests would not be diminished were the Court to go further and acknowledge the full error of Roe, as \"reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of\" this action. Ante, at 856.\n\nThe joint opinion thus turns to what can only be described as an unconventionaland unconvincingnotion of reliance, a view based on the surmise that the availability of abortion since Roe has led to \"two decades of economic and social developments\" that would be undercut if the error of Roe were recognized. Ante, at 856. The joint opinion's assertion of this fact is undeveloped and totally conclusory. In fact, one cannot be sure to what economic and social developments the opinion is referring. Surely it is dubious to suggest that women have reached their \"places in society\" in *957 reliance upon Roe, rather than as a result of their determination to obtain higher education and compete with men in the job market, and of society's increasing recognition of their ability to fill positions that were previously thought to be reserved only for men. Ante, at 856.\n\nIn the end, having failed to put forth any evidence to prove any true reliance, the joint opinion's argument is based solely on generalized assertions about the national psyche, on a belief that the people of this country have grown accustomed to the Roe decision over the last 19 years and have \"ordered their thinking and living around\" it. Ante, at 856. As an initial matter, one might inquire how the joint opinion can view the \"central holding\" of Roe as so deeply rooted in our constitutional culture, when it so casually uproots and disposes of that same decision's trimester framework. Furthermore, at various points in the past, the same could have been said about this Court's erroneous decisions that the Constitution allowed \"separate but equal\" treatment of minorities, see Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), or that \"liberty\" under the Due Process Clause protected \"freedom of contract,\" see Adkins v. Children's Hospital of District of Columbia, 261 U. S. 525 (1923); Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). The \"separate but equal\" doctrine lasted 58 years after Plessy, and Lochner `s protection of contractual freedom lasted 32 years. However, the simple fact that a generation or more had grown used to these major decisions did not prevent the Court from correcting its errors in those cases, nor should it prevent us from correctly interpreting the Constitution here. See Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954) (rejecting the \"separate but equal\" doctrine); West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937) (overruling Adkins v. Children's Hospital, supra, in upholding Washington's minimum wage law).\n\nApparently realizing that conventional stare decisis principles do not support its position, the joint opinion advances a belief that retaining a portion of Roe is necessary to protect *958 the \"legitimacy\" of this Court. Ante, at 861-869. Because the Court must take care to render decisions \"grounded truly in principle,\" and not simply as political and social compromises, ante, at 865, the joint opinion properly declares it to be this Court's duty to ignore the public criticism and protest that may arise as a result of a decision. Few would quarrel with this statement, although it may be doubted that Members of this Court, holding their tenure as they do during constitutional \"good behavior,\" are at all likely to be intimidated by such public protests.\n\nBut the joint opinion goes on to state that when the Court \"resolve[s] the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe and those rare, comparable cases,\" its decision is exempt from reconsideration under established principles of stare decisis in constitutional cases. Ante, at 866. This is so, the joint opinion contends, because in those \"intensely divisive\" cases the Court has \"call[ed] the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution,\" and must therefore take special care not to be perceived as \"surrender[ing] to political pressure\" and continued opposition. Ante, at 866, 867. This is a truly novel principle, one which is contrary to both the Court's historical practice and to the Court's traditional willingness to tolerate criticism of its opinions. Under this principle, when the Court has ruled on a divisive issue, it is apparently prevented from overruling that decision for the sole reason that it was incorrect, unless opposition to the original decision has died away.\n\nThe first difficulty with this principle lies in its assumption that cases that are \"intensely divisive\" can be readily distinguished from those that are not. The question of whether a particular issue is \"intensely divisive\" enough to qualify for special protection is entirely subjective and dependent on the individual assumptions of the Members of this Court. In addition, because the Court's duty is to ignore public opinion and criticism on issues that come before it, its Members are *959 in perhaps the worst position to judge whether a decision divides the Nation deeply enough to justify such uncommon protection. Although many of the Court's decisions divide the populace to a large degree, we have not previously on that account shied away from applying normal rules of stare decisis when urged to reconsider earlier decisions. Over the past 21 years, for example, the Court has overruled in whole or in part 34 of its previous constitutional decisions. See Payne v. Tennessee, supra, at 828-830, and n. 1 (listing cases).\n\nThe joint opinion picks out and discusses two prior Court rulings that it believes are of the \"intensely divisive\" variety, and concludes that they are of comparable dimension to Roe. Ante, at 861-864 (discussing Lochner v. New York, supra, and Plessy v. Ferguson, supra ). It appears to us very odd indeed that the joint opinion chooses as benchmarks two cases in which the Court chose not to adhere to erroneous constitutional precedent, but instead enhanced its stature by acknowledging and correcting its error, apparently in violation of the joint opinion's \"legitimacy\" principle. See West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, supra; Brown v. Board of Education, supra. One might also wonder how it is that the joint opinion puts these, and not others, in the \"intensely divisive\" category, and how it assumes that these are the only two lines of cases of comparable dimension to Roe. There is no reason to think that either Plessy or Lochner produced the sort of public protest when they were decided that Roe did. There were undoubtedly large segments of the bench and bar who agreed with the dissenting views in those cases, but surely that cannot be what the Court means when it uses the term \"intensely divisive,\" or many other cases would have to be added to the list. In terms of public protest, however, Roe, so far as we know, was unique. But just as the Court should not respond to that sort of protest by retreating from the decision simply to allay the concerns of the protesters, it should likewise not respond by determining to adhere to the *960 decision at all costs lest it seem to be retreating under fire. Public protests should not alter the normal application of stare decisis, lest perfectly lawful protest activity be penalized by the Court itself.\n\nTaking the joint opinion on its own terms, we doubt that its distinction between Roe, on the one hand, and Plessy and Lochner, on the other, withstands analysis. The joint opinion acknowledges that the Court improved its stature by overruling Plessy in Brown on a deeply divisive issue. And our decision in West Coast Hotel, which overruled Adkins v. Children's Hospital, supra, and Lochner, was rendered at a time when Congress was considering President Franklin Roosevelt's proposal to \"reorganize\" this Court and enable him to name six additional Justices in the event that any Member of the Court over the age of 70 did not elect to retire. It is difficult to imagine a situation in which the Court would face more intense opposition to a prior ruling than it did at that time, and, under the general principle proclaimed in the joint opinion, the Court seemingly should have responded to this opposition by stubbornly refusing to reexamine the Lochner rationale, lest it lose legitimacy by appearing to \"overrule under fire.\" Ante, at 867.\n\nThe joint opinion agrees that the Court's stature would have been seriously damaged if in Brown and West Coast Hotel it had dug in its heels and refused to apply normal principles of stare decisis to the earlier decisions. But the opinion contends that the Court was entitled to overrule Plessy and Lochner in those cases, despite the existence of opposition to the original decisions, only because both the Nation and the Court had learned new lessons in the interim. This is at best a feebly supported, post hoc rationalization for those decisions.\n\nFor example, the opinion asserts that the Court could justifiably overrule its decision in Lochner only because the Depression had convinced \"most people\" that constitutional protection of contractual freedom contributed to an economy *961 that failed to protect the welfare of all. Ante, at 861. Surely the joint opinion does not mean to suggest that people saw this Court's failure to uphold minimum wage statutes as the cause of the Great Depression! In any event, the Lochner Court did not base its rule upon the policy judgment that an unregulated market was fundamental to a stable economy; it simple believed, erroneously, that \"liberty\" under the Due Process Clause protected the \"right to make a contract.\" Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S., at 53. Nor is it the case that the people of this Nation only discovered the dangers of extreme laissez-faire economics because of the Depression. State laws regulating maximum hours and minimum wages were in existence well before that time. A Utah statute of that sort enacted in 1896 was involved in our decision in Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S. 366 (1898), and other States followed suit shortly afterwards, see, e. g., Muller v. Oregon, 208 U. S. 412 (1908); Bunting v. Oregon, 243 U. S. 426 (1917). These statutes were indeed enacted because of a belief on the part of their sponsors that \"freedom of contract\" did not protect the welfare of workers, demonstrating that that belief manifested itself more than a generation before the Great Depression. Whether \"most people\" had come to share it in the hard times of the 1930's is, insofar as anything the joint opinion advances, entirely speculative. The crucial failing at that time was not that workers were not paid a fair wage, but that there was no work available at any wage.\n\nWhen the Court finally recognized its error in West Coast Hotel, it did not engage in the post hoc rationalization that the joint opinion attributes to it today; it did not state that Lochner had been based on an economic view that had fallen into disfavor, and that it therefore should be overruled. Chief Justice Hughes in his opinion for the Court simply recognized what Justice Holmes had previously recognized in his Lochner dissent, that \"[t]he Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract.\" West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S., at 391; Lochner v. New York, supra, at 75 (Holmes, *962 J., dissenting) (\"[A] constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory, whether of paternalism and the organic relation of the citizen to the State or of laissez faire \"). Although the Court did acknowledge in the last paragraph of its opinion the state of affairs during the thencurrent Depression, the theme of the opinion is that the Court had been mistaken as a matter of constitutional law when it embraced \"freedom of contract\" 32 years previously.\n\nThe joint opinion also agrees that the Court acted properly in rejecting the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" in Brown. In fact, the opinion lauds Brown in comparing it to Roe. Ante, at 867. This is strange, in that under the opinion's \"legitimacy\" principle the Court would seemingly have been forced to adhere to its erroneous decision in Plessy because of its \"intensely divisive\" character. To us, adherence to Roe today under the guise of \"legitimacy\" would seem to resemble more closely adherence to Plessy on the same ground. Fortunately, the Court did not choose that option in Brown, and instead frankly repudiated Plessy. The joint opinion concludes that such repudiation was justified only because of newly discovered evidence that segregation had the effect of treating one race as inferior to another. But it can hardly be argued that this was not urged upon those who decided Plessy, as Justice Harlan observed in his dissent that the law at issue \"puts the brand of servitude and degradation upon a large class of our fellow-citizens, our equals before the law.\" Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S., at 562. It is clear that the same arguments made before the Court in Brown were made in Plessy as well. The Court in Brown simply recognized, as Justice Harlan had recognized beforehand, that the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit racial segregation. The rule of Brown is not tied to popular opinion about the evils of segregation; it is a judgment that the Equal Protection Clause does not permit racial segregation, no matter whether the public might come to believe that it is beneficial. On that ground it stands, and on that ground *963 alone the Court was justified in properly concluding that the Plessy Court had erred.\n\nThere is also a suggestion in the joint opinion that the propriety of overruling a \"divisive\" decision depends in part on whether \"most people\" would now agree that it should be overruled. Either the demise of opposition or its progression to substantial popular agreement apparently is required to allow the Court to reconsider a divisive decision. How such agreement would be ascertained, short of a public opinion poll, the joint opinion does not say. But surely even the suggestion is totally at war with the idea of \"legitimacy\" in whose name it is invoked. The Judicial Branch derives its legitimacy, not from following public opinion, but from deciding by its best lights whether legislative enactments of the popular branches of Government comport with the Constitution. The doctrine of stare decisis is an adjunct of this duty, and should be no more subject to the vagaries of public opinion than is the basic judicial task.\n\nThere are other reasons why the joint opinion's discussion of legitimacy is unconvincing as well. In assuming that the Court is perceived as \"surrender[ing] to political pressure\" when it overrules a controversial decision, ante, at 867, the joint opinion forgets that there are two sides to any controversy. The joint opinion asserts that, in order to protect its legitimacy, the Court must refrain from overruling a controversial decision lest it be viewed as favoring those who oppose the decision. But a decision to adhere to prior precedent is subject to the same criticism, for in such a case one can easily argue that the Court is responding to those who have demonstrated in favor of the original decision. The decision in Roe has engendered large demonstrations, including repeated marches on this Court and on Congress, both in opposition to and in support of that opinion. A decision either way on Roe can therefore be perceived as favoring one group or the other. But this perceived dilemma arises only if one assumes, as the joint opinion does, that the Court *964 should make its decisions with a view toward speculative public perceptions. If one assumes instead, as the Court surely did in both Brown and West Coast Hotel, that the Court's legitimacy is enhanced by faithful interpretation of the Constitution irrespective of public opposition, such selfengendered difficulties may be put to one side.\n\nRoe is not this Court's only decision to generate conflict. Our decisions in some recent capital cases, and in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986), have also engendered demonstrations in opposition. The joint opinion's message to such protesters appears to be that they must cease their activities in order to serve their cause, because their protests will only cement in place a decision which by normal standards of stare decisis should be reconsidered. Nearly a century ago, Justice David J. Brewer of this Court, in an article discussing criticism of its decisions, observed that \"many criticisms may be, like their authors, devoid of good taste, but better all sorts of criticism than no criticism at all.\" Justice Brewer on \"The Nation's Anchor,\" 57 Albany L. J. 166, 169 (1898). This was good advice to the Court then, as it is today. Strong and often misguided criticism of a decision should not render the decision immune from reconsideration, lest a fetish for legitimacy penalize freedom of expression.\n\nThe end result of the joint opinion's paeans of praise for legitimacy is the enunciation of a brand new standard for evaluating state regulation of a woman's right to abortion the \"undue burden\" standard. As indicated above, Roe v. Wade adopted a \"fundamental right\" standard under which state regulations could survive only if they met the requirement of \"strict scrutiny.\" While we disagree with that standard, it at least had a recognized basis in constitutional law at the time Roe was decided. The same cannot be said for the \"undue burden\" standard, which is created largely out of whole cloth by the authors of the joint opinion. It is a standard which even today does not command the support of a majority of this Court. And it will not, we believe, result *965 in the sort of \"simple limitation,\" easily applied, which the joint opinion anticipates. Ante, at 855. In sum, it is a standard which is not built to last.\n\nIn evaluating abortion regulations under that standard, judges will have to decide whether they place a \"substantial obstacle\" in the path of a woman seeking an abortion. Ante, at 877. In that this standard is based even more on a judge's subjective determinations than was the trimester framework, the standard will do nothing to prevent \"judges from roaming at large in the constitutional field\" guided only by their personal views. Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S., at 502 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment). Because the undue burden standard is plucked from nowhere, the question of what is a \"substantial obstacle\" to abortion will undoubtedly engender a variety of conflicting views. For example, in the very matter before us now, the authors of the joint opinion would uphold Pennsylvania's 24-hour waiting period, concluding that a \"particular burden\" on some women is not a substantial obstacle. Ante, at 887. But the authors would at the same time strike down Pennsylvania's spousal notice provision, after finding that in a \"large fraction\" of cases the provision will be a substantial obstacle. Ante, at 895. And, while the authors conclude that the informed consent provisions do not constitute an \"undue burden,\" Justice Stevens would hold that they do. Ante, at 920-922.\n\nFurthermore, while striking down the spousal notice regulation, the joint opinion would uphold a parental consent restriction that certainly places very substantial obstacles in the path of a minor's abortion choice. The joint opinion is forthright in admitting that it draws this distinction based on a policy judgment that parents will have the best interests of their children at heart, while the same is not necessarily true of husbands as to their wives. Ante, at 895. This may or may not be a correct judgment, but it is quintessentially a legislative one. The \"undue burden\" inquiry does not in any way supply the distinction between parental consent and *966 spousal consent which the joint opinion adopts. Despite the efforts of the joint opinion, the undue burden standard presents nothing more workable than the trimester framework which it discards today. Under the guise of the Constitution, this Court will still impart its own preferences on the States in the form of a complex abortion code.\n\nThe sum of the joint opinion's labors in the name of stare decisis and \"legitimacy\" is this: Roe v. Wade stands as a sort of judicial Potemkin Village, which may be pointed out to passers-by as a monument to the importance of adhering to precedent. But behind the facade, an entirely new method of analysis, without any roots in constitutional law, is imported to decide the constitutionality of state laws regulating abortion. Neither stare decisis nor \"legitimacy\" are truly served by such an effort.\n\nWe have stated above our belief that the Constitution does not subject state abortion regulations to heightened scrutiny. Accordingly, we think that the correct analysis is that set forth by the plurality opinion in Webster. A woman's interest in having an abortion is a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause, but States may regulate abortion procedures in ways rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 491 (1955); cf. Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 651-653 (1972). With this rule in mind, we examine each of the challenged provisions.IIIASection 3205 of the Act imposes certain requirements related to the informed consent of a woman seeking an abortion. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3205 (1990). Section 3205(a)(1) requires that the referring or performing physician must inform a woman contemplating an abortion of (i) the nature of the procedure and the risks and alternatives that a reasonable patient would find material; (ii) the fetus' probable gestational *967 age; and (iii) the medical risks involved in carrying her pregnancy to term. Section 3205(a)(2) requires a physician or a nonphysician counselor to inform the woman that (i) the state health department publishes free materials describing the fetus at different stages and listing abortion alternatives; (ii) medical assistance benefits may be available for prenatal, childbirth, and neonatal care; and (iii) the child's father is liable for child support. The Act also imposes a 24-hour waiting period between the time that the woman receives the required information and the time that the physician is allowed to perform the abortion. See Appendix to opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., ante, at 902-904.\n\nThis Court has held that it is certainly within the province of the States to require a woman's voluntary and informed consent to an abortion. See Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 760. Here, Pennsylvania seeks to further its legitimate interest in obtaining informed consent by ensuring that each woman \"is aware not only of the reasons for having an abortion, but also of the risks associated with an abortion and the availability of assistance that might make the alternative of normal childbirth more attractive than it might otherwise appear.\" Id., at 798-799 (White, J., dissenting).\n\nWe conclude that this provision of the statute is rationally related to the State's interest in assuring that a woman's consent to an abortion be a fully informed decision.\n\nSection 3205(a)(1) requires a physician to disclose certain information about the abortion procedure and its risks and alternatives. This requirement is certainly no large burden, as the Court of Appeals found that \"the record shows that the clinics, without exception, insist on providing this information to women before an abortion is performed.\" 947 F. 2d, at 703. We are of the view that this information \"clearly is related to maternal health and to the State's legitimate purpose in requiring informed consent.\" Akron v. *968 Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S., at 446. An accurate description of the gestational age of the fetus and of the risks involved in carrying a child to term helps to further both those interests and the State's legitimate interest in unborn human life. See id., at 445-446, n. 37 (required disclosure of gestational age of the fetus \"certainly is not objectionable\"). Although petitioners contend that it is unreasonable for the State to require that a physician, as opposed to a nonphysician counselor, disclose this information, we agree with the Court of Appeals that a State \"may rationally decide that physicians are better qualified than counselors to impart this information and answer questions about the medical aspects of the available alternatives.\" 947 F. 2d, at 704.\n\nSection 3205(a)(2) compels the disclosure, by a physician or a counselor, of information concerning the availability of paternal child support and state-funded alternatives if the woman decides to proceed with her pregnancy. Here again, the Court of Appeals observed that \"the record indicates that most clinics already require that a counselor consult in person with the woman about alternatives to abortion before the abortion is performed.\" Id., at 704-705. And petitioners do not claim that the information required to be disclosed by statute is in any way false or inaccurate; indeed, the Court of Appeals found it to be \"relevant, accurate, and noninflammatory.\" Id., at 705. We conclude that this required presentation of \"balanced information\" is rationally related to the State's legitimate interest in ensuring that the woman's consent is truly informed, Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 830 (O'Connor, J., dissenting), and in addition furthers the State's interest in preserving unborn life. That the information might create some uncertainty and persuade some women to forgo abortions does not lead to the conclusion that the Constitution forbids the provision of such information. Indeed, it only demonstrates that this information might *969 very well make a difference, and that it is therefore relevant to a woman's informed choice. Cf. id., at 801 (White, J., dissenting) (\"[T]he ostensible objective of Roe v. Wade is not maximizing the number of abortions, but maximizing choice\"). We acknowledge that in Thornburgh this Court struck down informed consent requirements similar to the ones at issue here. See id., at 760-764. It is clear, however, that while the detailed framework of Roe led to the Court's invalidation of those informational requirements, they \"would have been sustained under any traditional standard of judicial review, . . . or for any other surgical procedure except abortion.\" Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S., at 517 (plurality opinion) (citing Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 802 (White, J., dissenting); id., at 783 (Burger, C. J., dissenting)). In light of our rejection of Roe `s \"fundamental right\" approach to this subject, we do not regard Thornburgh as controlling.\n\nFor the same reason, we do not feel bound to follow this Court's previous holding that a State's 24-hour mandatory waiting period is unconstitutional. See Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., supra, at 449-451. Petitioners are correct that such a provision will result in delays for some women that might not otherwise exist, therefore placing a burden on their liberty. But the provision in no way prohibits abortions, and the informed consent and waiting period requirements do not apply in the case of a medical emergency. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3205(a), (b) (1990). We are of the view that, in providing time for reflection and reconsideration, the waiting period helps ensure that a woman's decision to abort is a well-considered one, and reasonably furthers the State's legitimate interest in maternal health and in the unborn life of the fetus. It \"is surely a small cost to impose to ensure that the woman's decision is well considered in light of its certain and irreparable consequences *970 on fetal life, and the possible effects on her own.\" 462 U. S., at 474 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).BIn addition to providing her own informed consent, before an unemancipated woman under the age of 18 may obtain an abortion she must either furnish the consent of one of her parents, or must opt for the judicial procedure that allows her to bypass the consent requirement. Under the judicial bypass option, a minor can obtain an abortion if a state court finds that she is capable of giving her informed consent and has indeed given such consent, or determines that an abortion is in her best interests. Records of these court proceedings are kept confidential. The Act directs the state trial court to render a decision within three days of the woman's application, and the entire procedure, including appeal to Pennsylvania Superior Court, is to last no longer than eight business days. The parental consent requirement does not apply in the case of a medical emergency. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3206 (1990). See Appendix to opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., ante, at 904-906.\n\nThis provision is entirely consistent with this Court's previous decisions involving parental consent requirements. See Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476 (1983) (upholding parental consent requirement with a similar judicial bypass option); Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., supra, at 439-440 (approving of parental consent statutes that include a judicial bypass option allowing a pregnant minor to \"demonstrate that she is sufficiently mature to make the abortion decision herself or that, despite her immaturity, an abortion would be in her best interests\"); Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622 (1979).\n\nWe think it beyond dispute that a State \"has a strong and legitimate interest in the welfare of its young citizens, whose immaturity, inexperience, and lack of judgment may sometimes *971 impair their ability to exercise their rights wisely.\" Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S., at 444 (opinion of Stevens, J.). A requirement of parental consent to abortion, like myriad other restrictions placed upon minors in other contexts, is reasonably designed to further this important and legitimate state interest. In our view, it is entirely \"rational and fair for the State to conclude that, in most instances, the family will strive to give a lonely or even terrified minor advice that is both compassionate and mature.\" Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S., at 520 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); see also Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S., at 91 (Stewart, J., concurring) (\"There can be little doubt that the State furthers a constitutionally permissible end by encouraging an unmarried pregnant minor to seek the help and advice of her parents in making the very important decision whether or not to bear a child\"). We thus conclude that Pennsylvania's parental consent requirement should be upheld.CSection 3209 of the Act contains the spousal notification provision. It requires that, before a physician may perform an abortion on a married woman, the woman must sign a statement indicating that she has notified her husband of her planned abortion. A woman is not required to notify her husband if (1) her husband is not the father, (2) her husband, after diligent effort, cannot be located, (3) the pregnancy is the result of a spousal sexual assault that has been reported to the authorities, or (4) the woman has reason to believe that notifying her husband is likely to result in the infliction of bodily injury upon her by him or by another individual. In addition, a woman is exempted from the notification requirement in the case of a medical emergency. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3209 (1990). See Appendix to opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., ante, at 908-909.\n\n*972 We first emphasize that Pennsylvania has not imposed a spousal consent requirement of the type the Court struck down in Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S., at 67-72. Missouri's spousal consent provision was invalidated in that case because of the Court's view that it unconstitutionally granted to the husband \"a veto power exercisable for any reason whatsoever or for no reason at all.\" Id., at 71. But the provision here involves a much less intrusive requirement of spousal notification, not consent. Such a law requiring only notice to the husband \"does not give any third party the legal right to make the [woman's] decision for her, or to prevent her from obtaining an abortion should she choose to have one performed.\" Hodgson v. Minnesota, supra, at 496 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); see H. L. v. Matheson, 450 U. S., at 411, n. 17. Danforth thus does not control our analysis. Petitioners contend that it should, however; they argue that the real effect of such a notice requirement is to give the power to husbands to veto a woman's abortion choice. The District Court indeed found that the notification provision created a risk that some woman who would otherwise have an abortion will be prevented from having one. 947 F. 2d, at 712. For example, petitioners argue, many notified husbands will prevent abortions through physical force, psychological coercion, and other types of threats. But Pennsylvania has incorporated exceptions in the notice provision in an attempt to deal with these problems. For instance, a woman need not notify her husband if the pregnancy is the result of a reported sexual assault, or if she has reason to believe that she would suffer bodily injury as a result of the notification. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3209(b) (1990). Furthermore, because this is a facial challenge to the Act, it is insufficient for petitioners to show that the notification provision \"might operate unconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances.\" United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987). Thus, it is not enough for petitioners *973 to show that, in some \"worst case\" circumstances, the notice provision will operate as a grant of veto power to husbands. Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S., at 514. Because they are making a facial challenge to the provision, they must \"show that no set of circumstances exists under which the [provision] would be valid.\" Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). This they have failed to do.[2]*974 The question before us is therefore whether the spousal notification requirement rationally furthers any legitimate state interests. We conclude that it does. First, a husband's interests in procreation within marriage and in the potential life of his unborn child are certainly substantial ones. See Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S., at 69 (\"We are not unaware of the deep and proper concern and interest that a devoted and protective husband has in his wife's pregnancy and in the growth and development of the fetus she is carrying\"); id., at 93 (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S., at 541. The State itself has legitimate interests both in protecting these interests of the father and in protecting the potential life of the fetus, and the spousal notification requirement is reasonably related to advancing those state interests. By providing that a husband will usually know of his spouse's intent to have an abortion, the provision makes it more likely that the husband will participate in deciding the fate of his unborn child, a possibility that might otherwise have been denied him. This participation might in some cases result in a decision to proceed with the pregnancy. As Judge Alito observed in his dissent below, \"[t]he Pennsylvania legislature could have rationally believed that some married women are initially inclined to obtain an abortion without their husbands' knowledge because of perceived problemssuch as economic constraints, future plans, or the husbands' previously expressed *975 oppositionthat may be obviated by discussion prior to the abortion.\" 947 F. 2d, at 726 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\nThe State also has a legitimate interest in promoting \"the integrity of the marital relationship.\" 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3209(a) (1990). This Court has previously recognized \"the importance of the marital relationship in our society.\" Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, supra, at 69. In our view, the spousal notice requirement is a rational attempt by the State to improve truthful communication between spouses and encourage collaborative decision making, and thereby fosters marital integrity. See Labine v. Vincent, 401 U. S. 532, 538 (1971) (\"[T]he power to make rules to establish, protect, and strengthen family life\" is committed to the state legislatures). Petitioners argue that the notification requirement does not further any such interest; they assert that the majority of wives already notify their husbands of their abortion decisions, and the remainder have excellent reasons for keeping their decisions a secret. In the first case, they argue, the law is unnecessary, and in the second case it will only serve to foster marital discord and threats of harm. Thus, petitioners see the law as a totally irrational means of furthering whatever legitimate interest the State might have. But, in our view, it is unrealistic to assume that every husband-wife relationship is either (1) so perfect that this type of truthful and important communication will take place as a matter of course, or (2) so imperfect that, upon notice, the husband will react selfishly, violently, or contrary to the best interests of his wife. See Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, supra, at 103-104 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (making a similar point in the context of a parental consent statute). The spousal notice provision will admittedly be unnecessary in some circumstances, and possibly harmful in others, but \"the existence of particular cases in which a feature of a statute performs no function (or is even counter productive) *976 ordinarily does not render the statute unconstitutional or even constitutionally suspect.\" Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S., at 800 (White, J., dissenting). The Pennsylvania Legislature was in a position to weigh the likely benefits of the provision against its likely adverse effects, and presumably concluded, on balance, that the provision would be beneficial. Whether this was a wise decision or not, we cannot say that it was irrational. We therefore conclude that the spousal notice provision comports with the Constitution. See Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S., at 325-326 (\"It is not the mission of this Court or any other to decide whether the balance of competing interests . . . is wise social policy\").DThe Act also imposes various reporting requirements. Section 3214(a) requires that abortion facilities file a report on each abortion performed. The reports do not include the identity of the women on whom abortions are performed, but they do contain a variety of information about the abortions. For example, each report must include the identities of the performing and referring physicians, the gestational age of the fetus at the time of abortion, and the basis for any medical judgment that a medical emergency existed. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3214(a)(1), (5), (10) (1990). See Appendix to opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., ante, at 909-911. The District Court found that these reports are kept completely confidential. 947 F. 2d, at 716. We further conclude that these reporting requirements rationally further the State's legitimate interests in advancing the state of medical knowledge concerning maternal health and prenatal life, in gathering statistical information with respect to patients, and in ensuring compliance with other provisions of the Act.\n\nSection 3207 of the Act requires each abortion facility to file a report with its name and address, as well as the names *977 and addresses of any parent, subsidiary, or affiliated organizations. 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3207(b) (1990). Section 3214(f) further requires each facility to file quarterly reports stating the total number of abortions performed, broken down by trimester. Both of these reports are available to the public only if the facility received state funds within the preceding 12 months. See Appendix to opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ., ante, at 906, 911. Petitioners do not challenge the requirement that facilities provide this information. They contend, however, that the forced public disclosure of the information given by facilities receiving public funds serves no legitimate state interest. We disagree. Records relating to the expenditure of public funds are generally available to the public under Pennsylvania law. See Pa. Stat. Ann., Tit. 65,  66.1, 66.2 (Purdon 1959 and Supp. 1991-1992). As the Court of Appeals observed, \"[w]hen a state provides money to a private commercial enterprise, there is a legitimate public interest in informing taxpayers who the funds are benefiting and what services the funds are supporting.\" 947 F. 2d, at 718. These reporting requirements rationally further this legitimate state interest.EFinally, petitioners challenge the medical emergency exception provided for by the Act. The existence of a medical emergency exempts compliance with the Act's informed consent, parental consent, and spousal notice requirements. See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3205(a), 3206(a), 3209(c) (1990). The Act defines a \"medical emergency\" as\"[t]hat condition which, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial *978 and irreversible impairment of major bodily function.\"  3203.Petitioners argued before the District Court that the statutory definition was inadequate because it did not cover three serious conditions that pregnant women can suffer preeclampsia, inevitable abortion, and prematurely ruptured membrane. The District Court agreed with petitioners that the medical emergency exception was inadequate, but the Court of Appeals reversed this holding. In construing the medical emergency provision, the Court of Appeals first observed that all three conditions do indeed present the risk of serious injury or death when an abortion is not performed, and noted that the medical profession's uniformly prescribed treatment for each of the three conditions is an immediate abortion. See 947 F. 2d, at 700-701. Finding that \"[t]he Pennsylvania legislature did not choose the wording of its medical emergency exception in a vacuum,\" the court read the exception as intended \"to assure that compliance with its abortion regulations would not in any way pose a significant threat to the life or health of a woman.\" Id., at 701. It thus concluded that the exception encompassed each of the three dangerous conditions pointed to by petitioners.\n\nWe observe that Pennsylvania's present definition of medical emergency is almost an exact copy of that State's definition at the time of this Court's ruling in Thornburgh, one which the Court made reference to with apparent approval. 476 U. S., at 771 (\"It is clear that the Pennsylvania Legislature knows how to provide a medical-emergency exception when it chooses to do so\").[3] We find that the interpretation *979 of the Court of Appeals in these cases is eminently reasonable, and that the provision thus should be upheld. When a woman is faced with any condition that poses a \"significant threat to [her] life or health,\" she is exempted from the Act's consent and notice requirements and may proceed immediately with her abortion.IVFor the reasons stated, we therefore would hold that each of the challenged provisions of the Pennsylvania statute is consistent with the Constitution. It bears emphasis that our conclusion in this regard does not carry with it any necessary approval of these regulations. Our task is, as always, to decide only whether the challenged provisions of a law comport with the United States Constitution. If,as we believe,these do,their wisdom as a matter of public policy is for the people of Pennsylvania to decide.Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice White, and Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.My views on this matter are unchanged from those I set forth in my separate opinions in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 532 (1989) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 520 (1990) (Akron II) (concurring opinion). The States may, if they wish, permit abortion on demand, but the Constitution does not require them to do so. The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to be resolved like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting. As the Court acknowledges, \"where reasonable people disagree the government can adopt one position or the other.\" Ante, at 851. The Court is correct in adding the qualification that this \"assumes a state of affairs in which the choice does not intrude upon a protected liberty,\" ibid. but the crucial part of that qualification *980 is the penultimate word. A State's choice between two positions on which reasonable people can disagree is constitutional even when (as is often the case) it intrudes upon a \"liberty\" in the absolute sense. Laws against bigamy, for examplewith which entire societies of reasonable people disagreeintrude upon men and women's liberty to marry and live with one another. But bigamy happens not to be a liberty specially \"protected\" by the Constitution.\n\nThat is, quite simply, the issue in these cases: not whether the power of a woman to abort her unborn child is a \"liberty\" in the absolute sense; or even whether it is a liberty of great importance to many women. Of course it is both. The issue is whether it is a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States. I am sure it is not. I reach that conclusion not because of anything so exalted as my views concerning the \"concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\" Ibid. Rather, I reach it for the same reason I reach the conclusion that bigamy is not constitutionally protectedbecause of two simple facts: (1) the Constitution says absolutely nothing about it, and (2) the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed.[1]Akron II, supra, at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring).\n\n*981 The Court destroys the proposition, evidently meant to represent my position, that \"liberty\" includes \"only those practices, defined at the most specific level, that were protected against government interference by other rules of law when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified,\" ante, at 847 (citing Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U. S. 110, 127, n. 6 (1989) (opinion of Scalia, J.)). That is not, however, what Michael H. says; it merely observes that, in defining \"liberty,\" we may not disregard a specific, \"relevant tradition protecting, or denying protection to, the asserted right,\" ibid. But the Court does not wish to be fettered by any such limitations on its preferences. The Court's statement that it is \"tempting\" to acknowledge the authoritativeness of tradition in order to \"cur[b] the discretion of federal judges,\" ante, at 847, is of course rhetoric rather than reality; no government official is \"tempted\" to place restraints upon his own freedom of action, which is why Lord Act on did not say \"Power tends to purify.\" The Court's temptation is in the quite opposite and more natural directiontowards systematically eliminating checks upon its own power; and it succumbs.\n\nBeyond that brief summary of the essence of my position, I will not swell the United States Reports with repetition of what I have said before; and applying the rational basis test, I would uphold the Pennsylvania statute in its entirety. I must, however, respond to a few of the more outrageous arguments in today's opinion, which it is beyond human nature to leave unanswered. I shall discuss each of them under a quotation from the Court's opinion to which they pertain.\"The inescapable fact is that adjudication of sub- stantive due process claims may call upon the Court*982 in interpreting the Constitution to exercise that same capacity which by tradition courts always have exercised: reasoned judgment.\" Ante, at 849.Assuming that the question before us is to be resolved at such a level of philosophical abstraction, in such isolation from the traditions of American society, as by simply applying \"reasoned judgment,\" I do not see how that could possibly have produced the answer the Court arrived at in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973). Today's opinion describes the methodology of Roe, quite accurately, as weighing against the woman's interest the State's \"`important and legitimate interest in protecting the potentiality of human life.' \" Ante, at 871 (quoting Roe, supra, at 162). But \"reasoned judgment\" does not begin by begging the question, as Roe and subsequent cases unquestionably did by assuming that what the State is protecting is the mere \"potentiality of human life.\" See, e. g., Roe, supra, at 162; Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 61 (1976); Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, 386 (1979); Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 428 (1983) (Akron I); Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476, 482 (1983). The whole argument of abortion opponents is that what the Court calls the fetus and what others call the unborn child is a human life. Thus, whatever answer Roe came up with after conducting its \"balancing\" is bound to be wrong, unless it is correct that the human fetus is in some critical sense merely potentially human. There is of course no way to determine that as a legal matter; it is in fact a value judgment. Some societies have considered newborn children not yet human, or the incompetent elderly no longer so.\n\nThe authors of the joint opinion, of course, do not squarely contend that Roe v. Wade was a correct application of \"reasoned judgment\"; merely that it must be followed, because of stare decisis. Ante, at 853, 861, 871. But in their exhaustive discussion of all the factors that go into the determination *983 of when stare decisis should be observed and when disregarded, they never mention \"how wrong was the decision on its face?\" Surely, if \"[t]he Court's power lies . .. in its legitimacy, a product of substance and perception,\" ante, at 865, the \"substance\" part of the equation demands that plain error be acknowledged and eliminated. Roe was plainly wrongeven on the Court's methodology of \"reasoned judgment,\" and even more so (of course) if the proper criteria of text and tradition are applied.\n\nThe emptiness of the \"reasoned judgment\" that produced Roe is displayed in plain view by the fact that, after more than 19 years of effort by some of the brightest (and most determined) legal minds in the country, after more than 10 cases upholding abortion rights in this Court, and after dozens upon dozens of amicus briefs submitted in these and other cases, the best the Court can do to explain how it is that the word \"liberty\" must be thought to include the right to destroy human fetuses is to rattle off a collection of adjectives that simply decorate a value judgment and conceal a political choice. The right to abort, we are told, inheres in \"liberty\" because it is among \"a person's most basic decisions,\" ante, at 849; it involves a \"most intimate and personal choic[e],\" ante, at 851; it is \"central to personal dignity and autonomy,\" ibid.; it \"originate[s] within the zone of conscience and belief,\" ante, at 852; it is \"too intimate and personal\" for state interference, ibid.; it reflects \"intimate views\" of a \"deep, personal character,\" ante, at 853; it involves \"intimate relationships\" and notions of \"personal autonomy and bodily integrity,\" ante, at 857; and it concerns a particularly \"`important decisio[n],' \" ante, at 859 (citation omitted).[2] But it is *984 obvious to anyone applying \"reasoned judgment\" that the same adjectives can be applied to many forms of conduct that this Court (including one of the Justices in today's majority, see Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986)) has held are not entitled to constitutional protectionbecause, like abortion, they are forms of conduct that have long been criminalized in American society. Those adjectives might be applied, for example, to homosexual sodomy, polygamy, adult incest, and suicide, all of which are equally \"intimate\" and \"deep[ly] personal\" decisions involving \"personal autonomy and bodily integrity,\" and all of which can constitutionally be proscribed because it is our unquestionable constitutional tradition that they are proscribable. It is not reasoned judgment that supports the Court's decision; only personal predilection. Justice Curtis's warning is as timely today as it was 135 years ago:\"[W]hen a strict interpretation of the Constitution, according to the fixed rules which govern the interpretation of laws, is abandoned, and the theoretical opinions of individuals are allowed to control its meaning, we have no longer a Constitution; we are under the government of individual men, who for the time being have power to declare what the Constitution is, according to their own views of what it ought to mean.\" Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393, 621 (1857) (dissenting opinion). \"Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt.\" Ante, at 844.One might have feared to encounter this august and sonorous phrase in an opinion defending the real Roe v. Wade, rather than the revised version fabricated today by the authors *985 of the joint opinion. The shortcomings of Roe did not include lack of clarity: Virtually all regulation of abortion before the third trimester was invalid. But to come across this phrase in the joint opinionwhich calls upon federal district judges to apply an \"undue burden\" standard as doubtful in application as it is unprincipled in originis really more than one should have to bear.\n\nThe joint opinion frankly concedes that the amorphous concept of \"undue burden\" has been inconsistently applied by the Members of this Court in the few brief years since that \"test\" was first explicitly propounded by Justice O'Connor in her dissent in Akron I, 462 U. S. 416 (1983). See ante, at 876.[3] Because the three Justices now wish to \"set forth a standard of general application,\" the joint opinion announces that \"it is important to clarify what is meant by an undue burden.\" Ibid. I certainly agree with that, but I do not agree that the joint opinion succeeds in the announced endeavor. To the contrary, its efforts at clarification *986 make clear only that the standard is inherently manipulable and will prove hopelessly unworkable in practice.\n\nThe joint opinion explains that a state regulation imposes an \"undue burden\" if it \"has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.\" Ante, at 877; see also ante, at 877-879. An obstacle is \"substantial,\" we are told, if it is \"calculated[,] [not] to inform the woman's free choice, [but to] hinder it.\" Ante, at 877.[4] This latter statement cannot *987 possibly mean what it says. Any regulation of abortion that is intended to advance what the joint opinion concedes is the State's \"substantial\" interest in protecting unborn life will be \"calculated [to] hinder\" a decision to have an abortion. It thus seems more accurate to say that the joint opinion would uphold abortion regulations only if they do not unduly hinder the woman's decision. That, of course, brings us right back to square one: Defining an \"undue burden\" as an \"undue hindrance\" (or a \"substantial obstacle\") hardly \"clarifies\" the test. Consciously or not, the joint opinion's verbal shell game will conceal raw judicial policy choices concerning what is \"appropriate\" abortion legislation.\n\nThe ultimately standard less nature of the \"undue burden\" inquiry is a reflection of the underlying fact that the concept has no principled or coherent legal basis. As The Chief Justice points out, Roe `s strict-scrutiny standard \"at least had a recognized basis in constitutional law at the time Roe was decided,\" ante, at 964, while \"[t]he same cannot be said for the `undue burden' standard, which is created largely out of whole cloth by the authors of the joint opinion,\" ibid. The joint opinion is flatly wrong in asserting that \"our jurisprudence relating to all liberties save perhaps abortion has recognized\" the permissibility of laws that do not impose an \"undue burden.\" Ante, at 873. It argues that the abortion right is similar to other rights in that a law \"not designed to strike at the right itself, [but which] has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to [exercise the right,]\" is not invalid. Ante, at 874. I agree, indeed I have *988 forcefully urged, that a law of general applicability which places only an incidental burden on a fundamental right does not infringe that right, see R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 389-390 (1992); Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872, 878-882 (1990), but that principle does not establish the quite different (and quite dangerous) proposition that a law which directly regulates a fundamental right will not be found to violate the Constitution unless it imposes an \"undue burden.\" It is that, of course, which is at issue here: Pennsylvania has consciously and directly regulated conduct that our cases have held is constitutionally protected. The appropriate analogy, therefore, is that of a state law requiring purchasers of religious books to endure a 24-hour waiting period, or to pay a nominal additional tax of 1. The joint opinion cannot possibly be correct in suggesting that we would uphold such legislation on the ground that it does not impose a \"substantial obstacle\" to the exercise of First Amendment rights. The \"undue burden\" standard is not at all the generally applicable principle the joint opinion pretends it to be; rather, it is a unique concept created specially for these cases, to preserve some judicial foothold in this ill-gotten territory. In claiming otherwise, the three Justices show their willingness to place all constitutional rights at risk in an effort to preserve what they deem the \"central holding in Roe. \" Ante, at 873.\n\nThe rootless nature of the \"undue burden\" standard, a phrase plucked out of context from our earlier abortion decisions, see n. 3, supra, is further reflected in the fact that the joint opinion finds it necessary expressly to repudiate the more narrow formulations used in Justice O'Connor's earlier opinions. Ante, at 876-877. Those opinions stated that a statute imposes an \"undue burden\" if it imposes \"absolute obstacles or severe limitations on the abortion decision,\" Akron I, 462 U. S., at 464 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis added); see also Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 828 (1986) (dissenting *989 opinion). Those strong adjectives are conspicuously missing from the joint opinion, whose authors have for some unexplained reason now determined that a burden is \"undue\" if it merely imposes a \"substantial\" obstacle to abortion decisions. See, e. g., ante, at 895, 901. Justice O'Connor has also abandoned (again without explanation) the view she expressed in Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476 (1983) (dissenting opinion), that a medical regulation which imposes an \"undue burden\" could nevertheless be upheld if it \"reasonably relate[s] to the preservation and protection of maternal health,\" id., at 505 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In today's version, even health measures will be upheld only \"if they do not constitute an undue burden,\" ante, at 878 (emphasis added). Gone too is Justice O'Connor's statement that \"the State possesses compelling interests in the protection of potential human life . . . throughout pregnancy,\" Akron I, supra, at 461 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis added); see also Ashcroft, supra, at 505 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Thornburgh, supra, at 828 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); instead, the State's interest in unborn human life is stealthily downgraded to a merely \"substantial\" or \"profound\" interest, ante, at 876, 878. (That had to be done, of course, since designating the interest as \"compelling\" throughout pregnancy would have been, shall we say, a \"substantial obstacle\" to the joint opinion's determined effort to reaffirm what it views as the \"central holding\" of Roe. See Akron I, 462 U. S., at 420, n. 1.) And \"viability\" is no longer the \"arbitrary\" dividing line previously decried by Justice O'Connor in Akron I, id., at 461; the Court now announces that \"the attainment of viability may continue to serve as the critical fact,\" ante, at 860.[5] It is difficult to *990 maintain the illusion that we are interpreting a Constitution rather than inventing one, when we amend its provisions so breezily.\n\nBecause the portion of the joint opinion adopting and describing the undue burden test provides no more useful guidance than the empty phrases discussed above, one must turn to the 23 pages applying that standard to the present facts for further guidance. In evaluating Pennsylvania's abortion law, the joint opinion relies extensively on the factual findings of the District Court, and repeatedly qualifies its conclusions by noting that they are contingent upon the record developed in these cases. Thus, the joint opinion would uphold the 24-hour waiting period contained in the Pennsylvania statute's informed consent provision, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat.  3205 (1990), because \"the record evidence shows that in the vast majority of cases, a 24-hour delay does not create any appreciable health risk,\" ante, at 885. The three Justices therefore conclude that \"on the record before us, . . . we are not convinced that the 24-hour waiting period constitutes an undue burden.\" Ante, at 887. The requirement that a doctor provide the information pertinent to informed consent would also be upheld because \"there is no evidence on this record that [this requirement] would amount in practical terms to a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion.\" Ante, at 884. Similarly, the joint opinion would uphold the reporting requirements of the Act,  3207, 3214, because \"there is no . . . showing on the record before us\" that these requirements constitute a \"substantial obstacle\" *991 to abortion decisions. Ante, at 901. But at the same time the opinion pointedly observes that these reporting requirements may increase the costs of abortions and that \"at some point [that fact] could become a substantial obstacle.\" Ibid. Most significantly, the joint opinion's conclusion that the spousal notice requirement of the Act, see  3209, imposes an \"undue burden\" is based in large measure on the District Court's \"detailed findings of fact,\" which the joint opinion sets out at great length, ante, at 888-891.\n\nI do not, of course, have any objection to the notion that, in applying legal principles, one should rely only upon the facts that are contained in the record or that are properly subject to judicial notice.[6] But what is remarkable about the joint opinion's fact-intensive analysis is that it does not result in any measurable clarification of the \"undue burden\" standard. Rather, the approach of the joint opinion is, for the most part, simply to highlight certain facts in the record that apparently strike the three Justices as particularly significant in establishing (or refuting) the existence of an undue burden; after describing these facts, the opinion then simply announces that the provision either does or does not impose a \"substantial obstacle\" or an \"undue burden.\" See, e. g., ante, at 880, 884-885, 887, 893-894, 895, 901. We do not know whether the same conclusions could have been reached on a different record, or in what respects the record would have had to differ before an opposite conclusion would have been *992 appropriate. The inherently standard less nature of this inquiry invites the district judge to give effect to his personal preferences about abortion. By finding and relying upon the right facts, he can invalidate, it would seem, almost any abortion restriction that strikes him as \"undue\"subject, of course, to the possibility of being reversed by a court of appeals or Supreme Court that is as unconstrained in reviewing his decision as he was in making it.\n\nTo the extent I can discern any meaningful content in the \"undue burden\" standard as applied in the joint opinion, it appears to be that a State may not regulate abortion in such a way as to reduce significantly its incidence. The joint opinion repeatedly emphasizes that an important factor in the \"undue burden\" analysis is whether the regulation \"prevent[s] a significant number of women from obtaining an abortion,\" ante, at 893; whether a \"significant number of women . . . are likely to be deterred from procuring an abortion,\" ante, at 894; and whether the regulation often \"deters\" women from seeking abortions, ante, at 897. We are not told, however, what forms of \"deterrence\" are impermissible or what degree of success in deterrence is too much to be tolerated. If, for example, a State required a woman to read a pamphlet describing, with illustrations, the facts of fetal development before she could obtain an abortion, the effect of such legislation might be to \"deter\" a \"significant number of women\" from procuring abortions, thereby seemingly allowing a district judge to invalidate it as an undue burden. Thus, despite flowery rhetoric about the State's \"substantial\" and \"profound\" interest in \"potential human life,\" and criticism of Roe for undervaluing that interest, the joint opinion permits the State to pursue that interest only so long as it is not too successful. As Justice Blackmun recognizes (with evident hope), ante, at 926, the \"undue burden\" standard may ultimately require the invalidation of each provision upheld today if it can be shown, on a better record, that the State is too effectively \"express[ing] a preference *993 for childbirth over abortion,\" ante, at 883. Reason finds no refuge in this jurisprudence of confusion.\"While we appreciate the weight of the arguments . . that Roe should be overruled, the reservations any of us may have in reaffirming the central holding of Roe are outweighed by the explication of individ- ual liberty we have given combined with the force of stare decisis.\" Ante, at 853.The Court's reliance upon stare decisis can best be described as contrived. It insists upon the necessity of adhering not to all of Roe, but only to what it calls the \"central holding.\" It seems to me that stare decisis ought to be applied even to the doctrine of stare decisis, and I confess never to have heard of this new, keep-what-you-want-and-throwaway-the-rest version. I wonder whether, as applied to Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), for example, the new version of stare decisis would be satisfied if we allowed courts to review the constitutionality of only those statutes that (like the one in Marbury) pertain to the jurisdiction of the courts.\n\nI am certainly not in a good position to dispute that the Court has saved the \"central holding\" of Roe, since to do that effectively I would have to know what the Court has saved, which in turn would require me to understand (as I do not) what the \"undue burden\" test means. I must confess, however, that I have always thought, and I think a lot of other people have always thought, that the arbitrary trimester framework, which the Court today discards, was quite as central to Roe as the arbitrary viability test, which the Court today retains. It seems particularly ungrateful to carve the trimester framework out of the core of Roe, since its very rigidity (in sharp contrast to the utter indeterminability of the \"undue burden\" test) is probably the only reason the Court is able to say, in urging stare decisis, that Roe \"has in no sense proven `unworkable,' \" ante, at 855. I suppose the *994 Court is entitled to call a \"central holding\" whatever it wants to call a \"central holding\"which is, come to think of it, perhaps one of the difficulties with this modified version of stare decisis. I thought I might note, however, that the following portions of Roe have not been saved:\n\nUnder Roe, requiring that a woman seeking an abortion be provided truthful information about abortion before giving informed written consent is unconstitutional, if the information is designed to influence her choice. Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 759-765; Akron I, 462 U. S., at 442-445. Under the joint opinion's \"undue burden\" regime (as applied today, at least) such a requirement is constitutional. Ante, at 881-885.\n\nUnder Roe, requiring that information be provided by a doctor, rather than by nonphysician counselors, is unconstitutional. Akron I, supra, at 446-449. Under the \"undue burden\" regime (as applied today, at least) it is not. Ante, at 884-885.\n\nUnder Roe, requiring a 24-hour waiting period between the time the woman gives her informed consent and the time of the abortion is unconstitutional. Akron I, supra, at 449-451. Under the \"undue burden\" regime (as applied today, at least) it is not. Ante, at 885-887.\n\nUnder Roe, requiring detailed reports that include demographic data about each woman who seeks an abortion and various information about each abortion is unconstitutional. Thornburgh, supra, at 765-768. Under the \"undue burden\" regime (as applied today, at least) it generally is not. Ante, at 900-901.\"Where, in the performance of its judicial duties, the Court decides a case in such a way as to resolve the sort of intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe . . . , its decision has a dimension that the resolu- tion of the normal case does not carry. It is the di- mension present whenever the Court's interpretation of the Constitution calls the contending sides of a*995 national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Con- stitution.\" Ante, at 866-867.The Court's description of the place of Roe in the social history of the United States is unrecognizable. Not only did Roe not, as the Court suggests, resolve the deeply divisive issue of abortion; it did more than anything else to nourish it, by elevating it to the national level where it is infinitely more difficult to resolve. National politics were not plagued by abortion protests, national abortion lobbying, or abortion marches on Congress before Roe v. Wade was decided. Profound disagreement existed among our citizens over the issueas it does over other issues, such as the death penaltybut that disagreement was being worked out at the state level. As with many other issues, the division of sentiment within each State was not as closely balanced as it was among the population of the Nation as a whole, meaning not only that more people would be satisfied with the results of state-by-state resolution, but also that those results would be more stable. Pre-Roe, moreover, political compromise was possible.\n\nRoe `s mandate for abortion on demand destroyed the compromises of the past, rendered compromise impossible for the future, and required the entire issue to be resolved uniformly, at the national level. At the same time, Roe created a vast new class of abortion consumers and abortion proponents by eliminating the moral opprobrium that had attached to the act. (\"If the Constitution guarantees abortion, how can it be bad?\"not an accurate line of thought, but a natural one.) Many favor all of those developments, and it is not for me to say that they are wrong. But to portray Roe as the states manlike \"settlement\" of a divisive issue, a jurisprudential Peace of Westphalia that is worth preserving, is nothing less than Orwellian. Roe fanned into life an issue that has inflamed our national politics in general, and has obscured with its smoke the selection of Justices to this Court *996 in particular, ever since. And by keeping us in the abortionumpiring business, it is the perpetuation of that disruption, rather than of any Pax Roeana, that the Court's new majority decrees.\"[T]o overrule under fire . . . would subvert the Court's legitimacy . . . . \". . . To all those who will be . . . tested by follow- ing, the Court implicitly undertakes to remain stead- fast . . . . The promise of constancy, once given, binds its maker for as long as the power to stand by the decision survives and . . . the commitment [is not] obsolete. . . .\"[The American people's] belief in themselves as . . . a people [who aspire to live according to the rule of law] is not readily separable from their under- standing of the Court invested with the authority to decide their constitutional cases and speak before all others for their constitutional ideals. If the Court's legitimacy should be undermined, then, so would the country be in its very ability to see itself through its constitutional ideals.\" Ante, at 867-868.The Imperial Judiciary lives. It is instructive to compare this Nietzschean vision of us unelected, life-tenured judges leading a Volk who will be \"tested by following,\" and whose very \"belief in themselves\" is mystically bound up in their \"understanding\" of a Court that \"speak[s] before all others for their constitutional ideals\"with the somewhat more modest role envisioned for these lawyers by the Founders.\"The judiciary . . . has . . . no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society, and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither Force nor Will, but merely judgment . . . .\"The Federalist No. 78, pp. 393-394 (G. Wills ed. 1982). Or, again, to compare this ecstasy of a Supreme Court in which there is, especially on controversial matters, no *997 shadow of change or hint of alteration (\"There is a limit to the amount of error that can plausibly be imputed to prior Courts,\" ante, at 866), with the more democratic views of a more humble man:\"[T]he candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the Government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, . . . the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their Government into the hands of that eminent tribunal.\" A. Lincoln, First Inaugural Address (Mar. 4, 1861), reprinted in Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United States, S. Doc. No. 101-10, p. 139 (1989).It is particularly difficult, in the circumstances of the present decision, to sit still for the Court's lengthy lecture upon the virtues of \"constancy,\" ante, at 868, of \"remain[ing] steadfast,\" ibid., and adhering to \"principle,\" ante, passim. Among the five Justices who purportedly adhere to Roe, at most three agree upon the principle that constitutes adherence (the joint opinion's \"undue burden\" standard)and that principle is inconsistent with Roe. See 410 U. S., at 154-156.[7] To make matters worse, two of the three, in order thus to remain steadfast, had to abandon previously stated positions. See n. 4, supra; see supra, at 988-990. It is beyond me how the Court expects these accommodations to be accepted \"as grounded truly in principle, not as compromises with social and political pressures having, as such, no bearing on the principled choices that the Court is obliged to make.\" Ante, at 865-866. The only principle the Court \"adheres\" *998 to, it seems to me, is the principle that the Court must be seen as standing by Roe. That is not a principle of law (which is what I thought the Court was talking about), but a principle of Realpolitikand a wrong one at that.\n\nI cannot agree with, indeed I am appalled by, the Court's suggestion that the decision whether to stand by an erroneous constitutional decision must be strongly influenced against overruling, no lessby the substantial and continuing public opposition the decision has generated. The Court's judgment that any other course would \"subvert the Court's legitimacy\" must be another consequence of reading the error-filled history book that described the deeply divided country brought together by Roe. In my history book, the Court was covered with dishonor and deprived of legitimacy by Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857), an erroneous (and widely opposed) opinion that it did not abandon, rather than by West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937), which produced the famous \"switch in time\" from the Court's erroneous (and widely opposed) constitutional opposition to the social measures of the New Deal. (Both Dred Scott and one line of the cases resisting the New Deal rested upon the concept of \"substantive due process\" that the Court praises and employs today. Indeed, Dred Scott was \"very possibly the first application of substantive due process in the Supreme Court, the original precedent for Lochner v. New York and Roe v. Wade. \" D. Currie, The Constitution in the Supreme Court 271 (1985) (footnotes omitted).)\n\nBut whether it would \"subvert the Court's legitimacy\" or not, the notion that we would decide a case differently from the way we otherwise would have in order to show that we can stand firm against public disapproval is frightening. It is a bad enough idea, even in the head of someone like me, who believes that the text of the Constitution, and our traditions, say what they say and there is no fiddling with them. But when it is in the mind of a Court that believes the Constitution *999 has an evolving meaning, see ante, at 848; that the Ninth Amendment's reference to \"othe[r]\" rights is not a disclaimer, but a charter for action, ibid.; and that the function of this Court is to \"speak before all others for [the people's] constitutional ideals\" unrestrained by meaningful text or traditionthen the notion that the Court must adhere to a decision for as long as the decision faces \"great opposition\" and the Court is \"under fire\" acquires a character of almost czarist arrogance. We are offended by these marchers who descend upon us, every year on the anniversary of Roe, to protest our saying that the Constitution requires what our society has never thought the Constitution requires. These people who refuse to be \"tested by following\" must be taught a lesson. We have no Cossacks, but at least we can stubbornly refuse to abandon an erroneous opinion that we might otherwise changeto show how little they intimidate us.\n\nOf course, as The Chief Justice points out, we have been subjected to what the Court calls \"`political pressure' \" by both sides of this issue. Ante, at 963. Maybe today's decision not to overrule Roe will be seen as buckling to pressure from that direction. Instead of engaging in the hopeless task of predicting public perceptiona job not for lawyers but for political campaign managersthe Justices should do what is legally right by asking two questions: (1) Was Roe correctly decided? (2) Has Roe succeeded in producing a settled body of law? If the answer to both questions is no, Roe should undoubtedly be overruled.\n\nIn truth, I am as distressed as the Court isand expressed my distress several years ago, see Webster, 492 U. S., at 535about the \"political pressure\" directed to the Court: the marches, the mail, the protests aimed at inducing us to change our opinions. How upsetting it is,that so many of our citizens (good people, not lawless ones, on both sides of this abortion issue, and on various sides of other issues as well) think that we Justices should properly take into account *1000 their views, as though we were engaged not in ascertaining an objective law but in determining some kind of social consensus. The Court would profit, I think, from giving less attention to the fact of this distressing phenomenon, and more attention to the cause of it. That cause permeates today's opinion: a new mode of constitutional adjudication that relies not upon text and traditional practice to determine the law, but upon what the Court calls \"reasoned judgment,\" ante, at 849, which turns out to be nothing but philosophical predilection and moral intuition. All manner of \"liberties,\" the Court tells us, inhere in the Constitution and are enforceable by this Courtnot just those mentioned in the text or established in the traditions of our society. Ante, at 847-849. Why even the Ninth Amendmentwhich says only that \"[t]he enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people\"is, despite our contrary understanding for almost 200 years, a literally boundless source of additional, unnamed, unhinted-at \"rights,\" definable and enforceable by us, through \"reasoned judgment.\" Ante, at 848-849.\n\nWhat makes all this relevant to the bothersome application of \"political pressure\" against the Court are the twin facts that the American people love democracy and the American people are not fools. As long as this Court thought (and the people thought) that we Justices were doing essentially lawyers' work up herereading text and discerning our society's traditional understanding of that textthe public pretty much left us alone. Texts and traditions are facts to study, not convictions to demonstrate about. But if in reality our process of constitutional adjudication consists primarily of making value judgments; if we can ignore a long and clear tradition clarifying an ambiguous text, as we did, for example, five days ago in declaring unconstitutional invocations and benedictions at public high school graduation ceremonies, Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577 (1992); if, as I say, our pronouncement of constitutional law rests primarily on value *1001 judgments, then a free and intelligent people's attitude towards us can be expected to be (ought to be) quite different. The people know that their value judgments are quite as good as those taught in any law schoolmaybe better. If, indeed, the \"liberties\" protected by the Constitution are, as the Court says, undefined and unbounded, then the people should demonstrate, to protest that we do not implement their values instead of ours. Not only that, but confirmation hearings for new Justices should deteriorate into questionand-answer sessions in which Senators go through a list of their constituents' most favored and most disfavored alleged constitutional rights, and seek the nominee's commitment to support or oppose them. Value judgments, after all, should be voted on, not dictated; and if our Constitution has somehow accidently committed them to the Supreme Court, at least we can have a sort of plebiscite each time a new nominee to that body is put forward. Justice Blackmun not only regards this prospect with equanimity, he solicits it. Ante, at 943.* * *There is a poignant aspect to today's opinion. Its length, and what might be called its epic tone, suggest that its authors believe they are bringing to an end a troublesome era in the history of our Nation and of our Court. \"It is the dimension\" of authority, they say, to \"cal[l] the contending sides of national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.\" Ante, at 867.\n\nThere comes vividly to mind a portrait by Emanuel Leutze that hangs in the Harvard Law School: Roger Brooke Taney, painted in 1859, the 82d year of his life, the 24th of his Chief Justiceship, the second after his opinion in Dred Scott. He is all in black, sitting in a shadowed red armchair, left hand resting upon a pad of paper in his lap, right hand hanging limply, almost lifelessly, beside the inner arm of the chair. He sits facing the viewer and staring straight out. There *1002 seems to be on his face, and in his deep-set eyes, an expression of profound sadness and disillusionment. Perhaps he always looked that way, even when dwelling upon the happiest of thoughts. But those of us who know how the lustre of his great Chief Justiceship came to be eclipsed by Dred Scott cannot help believing that he had that caseits already apparent consequences for the Court and its soon-to-beplayed-out consequences for the Nationburning on his mind. I expect that two years earlier he, too, had thought himself \"call[ing] the contending sides of national controversy to end their national division by accepting a common mandate rooted in the Constitution.\"\n\nIt is no more realistic for us in this litigation, than it was for him in that, to think that an issue of the sort they both involvedan issue involving life and death, freedom and subjugationcan be \"speedily and finally settled\" by the Supreme Court, as President James Buchanan in his inaugural address said the issue of slavery in the territories would be. See Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United States, S. Doc. No. 101-10, p. 126 (1989). Quite to the contrary, by foreclosing all democratic outlet for the deep passions this issue arouses, by banishing the issue from the political forum that gives all participants, even the losers, the satisfaction of a fair hearing and an honest fight, by continuing the imposition of a rigid national rule instead of allowing for regional differences, the Court merely prolongs and intensifies the anguish.\n\nWe should get out of this area, where we have no right to be, and where we do neither ourselves nor the country any good by remaining.NOTES[1]  It is sometimes useful to view the issue of stare decisis from a historical perspective. In the last 19 years, 15 Justices have confronted the basic issue presented in Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973). Of those, 11 have voted as the majority does today: Chief Justice Burger, Justices Douglas, Brennan, Stewart, Marshall, and Powell, and Justices Blackmun, O'Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and myself. Only fourall of whom happen to be on the Court todayhave reached the opposite conclusion.\n\n[2]  Professor Dworkin has made this comment on the issue:\n\n\"The suggestion that states are free to declare a fetus a person. . . . assumes that a state can curtail some persons' constitutional rights by adding new persons to the constitutional population. The constitutional rights of one citizen are of course very much affected by who or what else also has constitutional rights, because the rights of others may compete or conflict with his. So any power to increase the constitutional population by unilateral decision would be, in effect, a power to decrease rights the national Constitution grants to others.\n\n\". . . If a state could declare trees to be persons with a constitutional right to life, it could prohibit publishing newspapers or books in spite of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, which could not be understood as a license to kill. . . . Once we understand that the suggestion we are considering has that implication, we must reject it. If a fetus is not part of the constitutional population, under the national constitutional arrangement, then states have no power to overrule that national arrangement by themselves declaring that fetuses have rights competitive with the constitutional rights of pregnant women.\" Unenumerated Rights: Whether and How Roe Should be Overruled, 59 U. Chi. L. Rev. 381, 400 401 (1992).\n\n[3]  The state interest in protecting potential life may be compared to the state interest in protecting those who seek to immigrate to this country. A contemporary example is provided by the Haitians who have risked the perils of the sea in a desperate attempt to become \"persons\" protected by our laws. Humanitarian and practical concerns would support a state policy allowing those persons unrestricted entry; countervailing interests in population control support a policy of limiting the entry of these potential citizens. While the state interest in population control might be sufficient to justify strict enforcement of the immigration laws, that interest would not be sufficient to overcome a woman's liberty interest. Thus, a state interest in population control could not justify a state-imposed limit on family size or, for that matter, state-mandated abortions.\n\n[4]  As we noted in that opinion, the State's \"legitimate interest in protecting minor women from their own immaturity\" distinguished that case from Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (1983), which involved \"a provision that required that mature women, capable of consenting to an abortion, wait 24 hours after giving consent before undergoing an abortion.\" Hodgson, 497 U. S., at 449, n. 35.\n\n[5]  The joint opinion's reliance on the indirect effects of the regulation of constitutionally protected activity, see ante, at 873-874, is misplaced; what matters is not only the effect of a regulation but also the reason for the regulation. As I explained in Hodgson:\n\n\"In cases involving abortion, as in cases involving the right to travel or the right to marry, the identification of the constitutionally protected interest is merely the beginning of the analysis. State regulation of travel and of marriage is obviously permissible even though a State may not categorically exclude nonresidents from its borders, Shapiro v. Thompson,  394 U. S. 618, 631 (1969), or deny prisoners the right to marry, Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 94-99 (1987). But the regulation of constitutionally protected decisions, such as where a person shall reside or whom he or she shall marry, must be predicated on legitimate state concerns other than disagreement with the choice the individual has made. Cf. Turner  v. Safley, supra; Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 12 (1967). In the abortion area, a State may have no obligation to spend its own money, or use its own facilities, to subsidize nontherapeutic abortions for minors or adults. See, e. g., Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464 (1977); cf. Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 508-511 (1989); id., at 523-524 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). A State's value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion may provide adequate support for decisions involving such allocation of public funds, but not for simply substituting a state decision for an individual decision that a woman has a right to make for herself. Otherwise, the interest in liberty protected by the Due Process Clause would be a nullity. A state policy favoring childbirth over abortion is not in itself a sufficient justification for overriding the woman's decision or for placing `obstaclesabsolute or otherwisein the pregnant woman's path to an abortion.' \" 497 U. S., at 435.\n\n[6]  The meaning of any legal standard can only be understood by reviewing the actual cases in which it is applied. For that reason, I discount both Justice Scalia's comments on past descriptions of the standard, see post, at 988-990 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), and the attempt to give it crystal clarity in the joint opinion. The several opinions supporting the judgment in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), are less illuminating than the central holding of the case, which appears to have passed the test of time. The future may also demonstrate that a standard that analyzes both the severity of a regulatory burden and the legitimacy of its justification will provide a fully adequate framework for the review of abortion legislation even if the contours of the standard are not authoritatively articulated in any single opinion.\n\n[7]  U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 71 (111th ed. 1991).\n\n[8]  Although I agree that a parental-consent requirement (with the appropriate bypass) is constitutional, I do not join Part VD of the joint opinion because its approval of Pennsylvania's informed parental-consent requirement is based on the reasons given in Part VB, with which I disagree.BLACKMUN CONCURRENCE/DISSENT FOOTNOTE[1]  As I shall explain, the joint opinion and I disagree on the appropriate standard of review for abortion regulations. I do agree, however, that the reasons advanced by the joint opinion suffice to invalidate the spousal notification requirement under a strict scrutiny standard.\n\n[2]  I also join the Court's decision to uphold the medical emergency provision. As the Court notes, its interpretation is consistent with the essential holding ofRoe that \"forbids a State to interfere with a woman's choice to undergo an abortion procedure if continuing her pregnancy would constitute a threat to her health.\" Ante, at 880. As is apparent in my analysis below, however, this exception does not render constitutional the provisions which I conclude do not survive strict scrutiny.\n\n[3]  As the joint opinion acknowledges, ante, at 857, this Court has recognized the vital liberty interest of persons in refusing unwanted medical treatment. Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261 (1990). Just as the Due Process Clause protects the deeply personal decision of the individual to refuse medical treatment, it also must protect the deeply personal decision to obtain medical treatment, including a woman's decision to terminate a pregnancy.\n\n[4]  A growing number of commentators are recognizing this point. See, e. g., L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law  15-10, pp. 1353-1359 (2d ed. 1988); Siegel, Reasoning from the Body: A Historical Perspective on Abortion Regulation and Questions of Equal Protection, 44 Stan. L. Rev. 261, 350-380 (1992); Sunstein, Neutrality in Constitutional Law (With Special Reference to Pornography, Abortion, and Surrogacy), 92 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 31-44 (1992); cf. Rubenfeld, The Right of Privacy, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 737, 788-791 (1989) (similar analysis under the rubric of privacy); MacKinnon, Reflections on Sex Equality Under Law, 100 Yale L. J. 1281, 1308-1324 (1991).\n\n[5]  To say that restrictions on a right are subject to strict scrutiny is not to say that the right is absolute. Regulations can be upheld if they have no significant impact on the woman's exercise of her right and are justified by important state health objectives. See, e. g., Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, 65-67, 79-81 (1976) (upholding requirements of a woman's written consent and record keeping). But the Court today reaffirms the essential principle of Roe that a woman has the right \"to choose to have an abortion before viability and to obtain it without undue interference from the State.\" Ante, at 846. Under Roe, any more than de minimis interference is undue.\n\n[6]  The joint opinion agrees with Roe`s conclusion that viability occurs at 23 or 24 weeks at the earliest. Compare ante, at 860, with Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 160 (1973).\n\n[7]  While I do not agree with the joint opinion's conclusion that these provisions should be upheld, the joint opinion has remained faithful to principles this Court previously has announced in examining counseling provisions. For example, the joint opinion concludes that the \"information the State requires to be made available to the woman\" must be \"truthful and not misleading.\" Ante, at 882. Because the State's information must be \"calculated to inform the woman's free choice, not hinder it,\" ante, at 877, the measures must be designed to ensure that a woman's choice is \"mature and informed,\" ante, at 883, not intimidated, imposed, or impelled. To this end, when the State requires the provision of certain information, the State may not alter the manner of presentation in order to inflict \"psychological abuse,\" ante, at 893, designed to shock or unnerve a woman seeking to exercise her liberty right. This, for example, would appear to preclude a State from requiring a woman to view graphic literature or films detailing the performance of an abortion operation. Just as a visual preview of an operation to remove an appendix plays no part in a physician's securing informed consent to an appendectomy, a preview of scenes appurtenant to any major medical intrusion into the human body does not constructively inform the decision of a woman of the State's interest in the preservation of the woman's health or demonstrate the State's \"profound respect for the life of the unborn.\" Ante, at 877.\n\n[8]  The Court's decision in Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417 (1990), validating a 48-hour waiting period for minors seeking an abortion to permit parental involvement does not alter this conclusion. Here the 24-hour delay is imposed on an adult woman. See id., at 449-450, n. 35; Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 497 U. S. 502 (1990). Moreover, the statute in Hodgson did not require any delay once the minor obtained the affirmative consent of either a parent or the court.\n\n[9]  Because this information is so widely known, I am confident that a developed record can be made to show that the 24-hour delay, \"in a large fraction of the cases in which [the restriction] is relevant, . . . will operate as a substantial obstacle to a woman's choice to undergo an abortion.\" Ante, at 895.\n\n[10]  The judicial-bypass provision does not cure this violation.Hodgson is distinguishable, since these cases involve more than parental involvement or approvalrather, the Pennsylvania law requires that the parent receive information designed to discourage abortion in a face-to-face meeting with the physician. The bypass procedure cannot ensure that the parent would obtain the information, since in many instances, the parent would not even attend the hearing. A State may not place any restriction on a young woman's right to an abortion,however irrational,simply because it has provided a judicial bypass.\n\n[11]  Obviously, I do not share The Chief Justice's views of homosexuality as sexual deviance. See Bowers, 478 U. S., at 202-203, n. 2.\n\n[12]  Justice Scalia urges the Court to \"get out of this area,\" post, at 1002, and leave questions regarding abortion entirely to the States, post, at 999-1000. Putting aside the fact that what he advocates is nothing short of an abdication by the Court of its constitutional responsibilities, Justice Scalia is uncharacteristically naive if he thinks that overruling Roe and holding that restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion are subject only to rational-basis review will enable the Court henceforth to avoid reviewing abortion-related issues. State efforts to regulate and prohibit abortion in a post-Roe world undoubtedly would raise a host of distinct and important constitutional questions meriting review by this Court. For example, does the Eighth Amendment impose any limits on the degree or kind of punishment a State can inflict upon physicians who perform, or women who undergo, abortions? What effect would differences among States in their approaches to abortion have on a woman's right to engage in interstate travel? Does the First Amendment permit States that choose not to criminalize abortion to ban all advertising providing information about where and how to obtain abortions?REHNQUIST CONCURRENCE/DISSENT FOOTNOTES[1]  Two years after Roe, the West German constitutional court, by contrast, struck down a law liberalizing access to abortion on the grounds that life developing within the womb is constitutionally protected. Judgment of February 25, 1975, 39 BVerfGE 1 (translated in Jonas & Gorby, West German Abortion Decision: A Contrast to Roe v. Wade, 9 John Marshall J. Prac. & Proc. 605 (1976)). In 1988, the Canadian Supreme Court followed reasoning similar to that of Roe in striking down a law that restricted abortion. Morgentaler v. Queen, 1 S. C. R. 30, 44 D. L. R. 4th 385 (1988).\n\n[2]  The joint opinion of Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter appears to ignore this point in concluding that the spousal notice provision imposes an undue burden on the abortion decision. Ante, at 887-898. In most instances the notification requirement operates without difficulty. As the District Court found, the vast majority of wives seeking abortions notify and consult with their husbands, and thus suffer no burden as a result of the provision. 744 F. Supp. 1323, 1360 (ED Pa. 1990). In other instances where a woman does not want to notify her husband, the Act provides exceptions. For example, notification is not required if the husband is not the father, if the pregnancy is the result of a reported spousal sexual assault, or if the woman fears bodily injury as a result of notifying her husband. Thus, in these instances as well, the notification provision imposes no obstacle to the abortion decision.\n\nThe joint opinion puts to one side these situations where the regulation imposes no obstacle at all,and instead focuses on the group of married women who would not otherwise notify their husbands and who do not qualify for one of the exceptions. Having narrowed the focus, the joint opinion concludes that in a \"large fraction\" of those cases, the notification provision operates as a substantial obstacle, ante, at 895, and that the provision is therefore invalid. There are certainly instances where a woman would prefer not to notify her husband, and yet does not qualify for an exception. For example, there are the situations of battered women who fear psychological abuse or injury to their children as a result of notification; because in these situations the women do not fear bodily injury, they do not qualify for an exception. And there are situations where a woman has become pregnant as a result of an unreported spousal sexual assault; when such an assault is unreported, no exception is available. But, as the District Court found, there are also instances where the woman prefers not to notify her husband for a variety of other reasons. See 744 F. Supp., at 1360. For example, a woman might desire to obtain an abortion without her husband's knowledge because of perceived economic constraints or her husband's previously expressed opposition to abortion. The joint opinion concentrates on the situations involving battered women and unreported spousal assault, and assumes, without any support in the record, that these instances constitute a \"large fraction\" of those cases in which women prefer not to notify their husbands (and do not qualify for an exception). Ante, at 895. This assumption is not based on any hard evidence, however. And were it helpful to an attempt to reach a desired result, one could just as easily assume that the battered women situations form 100 percent of the cases where women desire not to notify, or that they constitute only 20 percent of those cases. But reliance on such speculation is the necessary result of adopting the undue burden standard.\n\n[3]  The definition in use at that time provided as follows:\n\n\"`Medical emergency.'That condition which, on the basis of the physician's best clinical judgment, so complicates a pregnancy as to necessitate the immediate abortion of same to avert the death of the mother or for which a 24-hour delay will create grave peril of immediate and irreversible loss of major bodily function.\" Pa. Stat.Ann., Tit.18,  3203(Purdon 1983).SCALIA CONCURRENCE/DISSENT FOOTNOTES[1]  The Court's suggestion, ante, at 847-848, that adherence to tradition would require us to uphold laws against interracial marriage is entirely wrong. Any tradition in that case was contradicted by a text an Equal Protection Clause that explicitly establishes racial equality as a constitutional value. See Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 9 (1967) (\"In the case at bar, . . . we deal with statutes containing racial classifications, and the fact of equal application does not immunize the statute from the very heavy burden of justification which the Fourteenth Amendment has traditionally required of state statutes drawn according to race\"); see also id., at 13 (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment). The enterprise launched in Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), by contrast, sought to establish in the teeth of a clear, contrary traditiona value found nowhere in the constitutional text.\n\nThere is, of course, no comparable tradition barring recognition of a \"liberty interest\" in carrying one's child to term free from state efforts to kill it. For that reason, it does not follow that the Constitution does not protect childbirth simply because it does not protect abortion. The Court's contention, ante, at 859, that the only way to protect childbirth is to protect abortion shows the utter bankruptcy of constitutional analysis deprived of tradition as a validating factor.It drives one to say that the only way to protect the right to eat is to acknowledge the constitutional right to starve oneself to death.\n\n[2]  Justice Blackmun's parade of adjectives is similarly empty: Abortion is among \"`the most intimate and personal choices,' \"ante, at 923; it is a matter \"central to personal dignity and autonomy,\" ibid.; and it involves \"personal decisions that profoundly affect bodily integrity,identity,and destiny,\" ante, at 927.Justice Stevens is not much less conclusory: The decision to choose abortion is a matter of \"the highest privacy and the most personal nature,\" ante, at 915; it involves a \"`difficult choice having serious and personal consequences of major importance to [a woman's] future,' \" ante, at 916; the authority to make this \"traumatic and yet empowering decisio[n]\" is \"an element of basic human dignity,\" ibid.; and it is \"nothing less than a matter of conscience,\" ibid.\n\n[3]  The joint opinion is clearly wrong in asserting, ante, at 874, that \"the Court's early abortion cases adhered to\" the \"undue burden\" standard. The passing use of that phrase in Justice Blackmun's opinion for the Court in Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U. S. 132, 147 (1976) (Bellotti I), was not by way of setting forth the standard of unconstitutionality, as Justice O'Connor's later opinions did, but by way of expressing the conclusion of unconstitutionality. Justice Powell for a time appeared to employ a variant of \"undue burden\" analysis in several non majority opinions, see, e. g., Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622, 647 (1979) (Bellotti II); Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U. S. 678, 705 (1977) (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), but he too ultimately rejected that standard in his opinion for the Court in Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416, 420, n. 1 (1983) (Akron I) . The joint opinion's reliance on Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464, 473 (1977), and Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 314 (1980), is entirely misplaced, since those cases did not involve regulation of abortion, but mere refusal to fund it. In any event, Justice O'Connor's earlier formulations have apparently now proved unsatisfactory to the three Justices, whoin the name of stare decisis no lesstoday find it necessary to devise an entirely new version of \"undue burden\" analysis. See ante, at 877-879.\n\n[4]  The joint opinion further asserts that a law imposing an undue burden on abortion decisions is not a \"permissible\" means of serving \"legitimate\" state interests. Ante, at 877. This description of the undue burden standard in terms more commonly associated with the rational-basis test will come as a surprise even to those who have followed closely our wanderings in this forsaken wilderness. See, e. g., Akron I, supra, at 463 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (\"The `undue burden' . . . represents the required threshold inquiry that must be conducted before this Court can require a State to justify its legislative actions under the exacting `compelling state interest' standard\"); see also Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417, 458-460 (1990) (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment in part); Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 828 (1986) (O'Connor, J., dissenting). This confusing equation of the two standards is apparently designed to explain how one of the Justices who joined the plurality opinion in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490 (1989), which adopted the rational-basis test, could join an opinion expressly adopting the undue burden test. See id., at 520 (rejecting the view that abortion is a \"fundamental right,\" instead inquiring whether a law regulating the woman's \"liberty interest\" in abortion is \"reasonably designed\" to further \"legitimate\" state ends). The same motive also apparently underlies the joint opinion's erroneous citation of the plurality opinion in Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 506 (1990) (Akron II) (opinion of Kennedy, J.), as applying the undue burden test. See ante, at 876 (using this citation to support the proposition that \"two of us\"i. e., two of the authors of the joint opinionhave previously applied this test). In fact, Akron II does not mention the undue burden standard until the conclusion of the opinion, when it states that the statute at issue \"does not impose an undue, or otherwise unconstitutional, burden.\" 497 U. S., at 519 (emphasis added). I fail to see how anyone can think that saying a statute does not impose an unconstitutional burden under any standard, including the undue burden test, amounts to adopting the undue burden test as the exclusive standard. The Court's citation of Hodgson as reflecting Justice Kennedy's and Justice O'Connor's \"shared premises,\" ante, at 878, is similarly inexplicable, since the word \"undue\" was never even used in the former's opinion in that case.I joined Justice Kennedy's opinions in both Hodgson and Akron II; I should be grateful, I suppose, that the joint opinion does not claim that I, too, have adopted the undue burden test.\n\n[5]  Of course Justice O'Connor was correct in her former view. The arbitrariness of the viability line is confirmed by the Court's inability to offer any justification for it beyond the conclusory assertion that it is only at that point that the unborn child's life \"can in reason and all fairness\" be thought to override the interests of the mother. Ante, at 870. Precisely why is it that, at the magical second when machines currently in use (though not necessarily available to the particular woman) are able to keep an unborn child alive apart from its mother, the creature is suddenly able (under our Constitution) to be protected by law, whereas before that magical second it was not? That makes no more sense than according infants legal protection only after the point when they can feed themselves.\n\n[6]  The joint opinion is not entirely faithful to this principle, however. In approving the District Court's factual findings with respect to the spousal notice provision, it relies extensively on nonrecord materials, and in reliance upon them adds a number of factual conclusions of its own. Ante, at 891-893. Because this additional factfinding pertains to matters that surely are \"subject to reasonable dispute,\" Fed. Rule Evid. 201(b), the joint opinion must be operating on the premise that these are \"legislative\" rather than \"adjudicative\" facts, see Rule 201(a). But if a court can find an undue burden simply by selectively string-citing the right social science articles, I do not see the point of emphasizing or requiring \"detailed factual findings\" in the District Court.\n\n[7]  Justice Blackmun's effort to preserve as much of Roe as possible leads him to read the joint opinion as more \"constan[t]\" and \"steadfast\" than can be believed. He contends that the joint opinion's \"undue burden\" standard requires the application of strict scrutiny to \"all non-de-minimis \" abortion regulations, ante, at 926, but that could only be true if a \"substantial obstacle,\" ante, at 877 (joint opinion), were the same thing as a nonde-minimis obstaclewhich it plainly is not.Embed"}]
