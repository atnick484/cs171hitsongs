CHAPTER ONE\n\nNAMES OF PEOPLE: THE DUCHESSE DE GUERMANTES \u2014 SAINT-LOUP AT DONCI\u00c8RES \u2014 MME. DE VILLEPARISIS AT HOME \u2014 MY GRANDMOTHER\u2019S ILLNESS \u2014 BERGOTTE\u2019S ILLNESS \u2014 THE DUKE AND THE DOCTOR \u2014 DECLINE AND DEATH OF MY GRANDMOTHER\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The twittering of the birds at daybreak sounded insipid to Fran\u00e7oise. Every word uttered by the maids upstairs made her jump; disturbed by all their running about, she kept asking herself what they could be doing. In other words, we had moved. Certainly the servants had made no less noise in the attics of our old home; but she knew them, she had made of their comings and goings familiar events. Now she faced even silence with a strained attention. And as our new neighbourhood appeared to be as quiet as the boulevard on to which we had hitherto looked had been noisy, the song (distinct at a distance, when it was still quite faint, like an orchestralmotif) of a passer-by brought tears to the eyes of a Fran\u00e7oise in exile. And so if I had been tempted to laugh at her in her misery at having to leave a house in which she was \u2018so well respected on all sides\u2019 and had packed her trunks with tears, according to the Use of Combray, declaring superior to all possible houses that which had been ours, on the other hand I, who found it as hard to assimilate new as I found it easy to abandon old conditions, I felt myself drawn towards our old servant when I saw that this installation of herself in a building where she had not received from the hall-porter, who did not yet know us, the marks of respect necessary to her moral wellbeing, had brought her positively to the verge of dissolution. She alone could understand what I was feeling; certainly her young footman was not the person to do so; for him, who was as unlike the Combray type as it was possible to conceive, packing up, moving, living in another district, were all like taking a holiday in which the novelty of one\u2019s surroundings gave one the same sense of refreshment as if one had actually travelled; he thought he was in the country; and a cold in the head afforded him, as though he had been sitting in a draughty railway carriage, the delicious sensation of having seen the world; at each fresh sneeze he rejoiced that he had found so smart a place, having always longed to be with people who travelled a lot. And so, without giving him a thought, I went straight to Fran\u00e7oise, who, in return for my having laughed at her tears over a removal which had left me cold, now shewed an icy indifference to my sorrow, but because she shared it. The \u2018sensibility\u2019 claimed by neurotic people is matched by their egotism; they cannot abide the flaunting by others of the sufferings to which they pay an ever increasing attention in themselves. Fran\u00e7oise, who would not allow the least of her own ailments to pass unnoticed, if I were in pain would turn her head from me so that I should not have the satisfaction of seeing my sufferings pitied, or so much as observed. It was the same as soon as I tried to speak to her about our new house. Moreover, having been obliged, a day or two later, to return to the house we had just left, to retrieve some clothes which had been overlooked in our removal, while I, as a result of it, had still a \u2018temperature,\u2019 and like a boa constrictor that has just swallowed an ox felt myself painfully distended by the sight of a long trunk which my eyes had still to digest, Fran\u00e7oise, with true feminine inconstancy, came back saying that she had really thought she would stifle on our old boulevard, it was so stuffy, that she had found it quite a day\u2019s journey to get there, that never had she seen such stairs, that she would not go back to live there for a king\u2019s ransom, not if you were to offer her millions \u2014 a pure hypothesis \u2014 and that everything (everything, that is to say, to do with the kitchen and \u2018usual offices\u2019) was much better fitted up in the new house. Which, it is high time now that the reader should be told \u2014 and told also that we had moved into it because my grandmother, not having been at all well (though we took care to keep this reason from her), was in need of better air \u2014 was a flat forming part of the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the age when a Name, offering us an image of the unknowable which we have poured into its mould, while at the same moment it connotes for us also an existing place, forces us accordingly to identify one with the other to such a point that we set out to seek in a city for a soul which it cannot embody but which we have no longer the power to expel from the sound of its name, it is not only to towns and rivers that names give an individuality, as do allegorical paintings, it is not only the physical universe which they pattern with differences, people with marvels, there is the social universe also; and so every historic house, in town or country, has its lady or its fairy, as every forest has its spirit, as there is a nymph for every stream. Sometimes, hidden in the heart of its name, the fairy is transformed to suit the life of our imagination by which she lives; thus it was that the atmosphere in which Mme. de Guermantes existed in me, after having been for years no more than the shadow cast by a magic lantern slide or the light falling through a painted window, began to let its colours fade when quite other dreams impregnated it with the bubbling coolness of her flowing streams\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet the fairy must perish if we come in contact with the real person to whom her name corresponds, for that person the name then begins to reflect, and she has in her nothing of the fairy; the fairy may revive if we remove ourself from the person, but if we remain in her presence the fairy definitely dies and with her the name, as happened to the family of Lusignan, which was fated to become extinct on the day when the fairy M\u00e9lusine should disappear. Then the Name, beneath our successive \u2018restorations\u2019 of which we may end by finding, as their original, the beautiful portrait of a strange lady whom we are never to meet, is nothing more than the mere photograph, for identification, to which we refer in order to decide whether we know, whether or not we ought to bow to a person who passes us in the street. But let a sensation from a bygone year \u2014 like those recording instruments which preserve the sound and the manner of the various artists who have sung or played into them \u2014 enable our memory to make us hear that name with the particular ring with which it then sounded in our ears, then, while the name itself has apparently not changed, we feel the distance that separates the dreams which at different times its same syllables have meant to us. For a moment, from the clear echo of its warbling in some distant spring, we can extract, as from the little tubes which we use in painting, the exact, forgotten, mysterious, fresh tint of the days which we had believed ourself to be recalling, when, like a bad painter, we were giving to the whole of our past, spread out on the same canvas, the tones, conventional and all alike, of our unprompted memory. Whereas on the contrary, each of the moments that composed it employed, for an original creation, in a matchless harmony, the colour of those days which we no longer know, and which, for that matter, will still suddenly enrapture me if by any chance the name \u2018Guermantes,\u2019 resuming for a moment, after all these years, the sound, so different from its sound to-day, which it had for me on the day of Mile. Percepied\u2019s marriage, brings back to me that mauve \u2014 so delicate, almost too bright, too new \u2014 with which the billowy scarf of the young Duchess glowed, and, like two periwinkle flowers, growing beyond reach and blossoming now again, her two eyes, sunlit with an azure smile. And the name Guermantes of those days is also like one of those little balloons which have been filled wilh oxygen, or some such gas; when I come to explode it, to make it emit what it contains, I breathe the air of the Combray of that year, of that day, mingled with a fragrance of hawthorn blossom blown by the wind from the corner of the square, harbinger of rain, which now sent the sun packing, now let him spread himself over the red woollen carpet to the sacristy, steeping it in a bright geranium scarlet, with that, so to speak, Wagnerian harmony in its gaiety which makes the wedding service always impressive. But even apart from rare moments such as these, in which suddenly we feel the original entity quiver and resume its form, carve itself out of the syllables now soundless, dead; if, in the giddy rush of daily life, in which they serve only the most practical purposes, names have lost all their colour, like a prismatic top that spins too quickly and seems only grey, when, on the other hand, in our musings we reflect, we seek, so as to return to the past, to slacken, to suspend the perpetual motion by which we are borne alcng, gradually we see once more appear, side by side, but entirely distinct from one another, the tints which in the course of our existence have been successively presented to us by a single name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What form was assumed in my mind by this name Guermantes when my first nurse \u2014 knowing no more, probably, than I know to-day in whose honour it had been composed \u2014 sang me to sleep with that old ditty, Gloire \u00e0 la Marquise de Guermantes, or when, some years later, the veteran Mar\u00e9chal de Guermantes, making my nursery-maid\u2019s bosom swell with pride, stopped in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es to remark: \u201cA fine child that!\u201d and gave me a chocolate drop from his comfit-box, I cannot, of course, now say. Those years of my earliest childhood are no longer a part of myself; they are external to me; I can learn nothing of them save as we learn things that happened before we were born \u2014 from the accounts given me by other people. But more recently I find in the period of that name\u2019s occupation of me seven or eight different shapes which it has successively assumed; the earliest were the most beautiful; gradually my musings, forced by reality to abandon a position that was no longer tenable, established themselves anew in one slightly less advanced until they were obliged to retire still farther. And, with Mme. de Guermantes, was transformed simultaneously her dwelling, itself also the offspring of that name, fertilised from year to year by some word or other that came to my ears and modulated the tone of my musings; that dwelling of hers reflected them in its very stones, which had turned to mirrors, like the surface of a cloud or of a lake. A dungeon keep without mass, no more indeed than a band of orange light from the summit of which the lord and his lady dealt out life and death to their vassals, had given place \u2014 right at the end of that \u2018Guermantes way\u2019 along which, on so many summer afternoons, I retraced with my parents the course of the Vivonne \u2014 to that land of bubbling streams where the Duchess taught me to fish for trout and to know the names of the flowers whose red and purple clusters adorned the walls of the neighbouring gardens; then it had been the ancient heritage, famous in song and story, from which the proud race of Guermantes, like a carved and mellow tower that traverses the ages, had risen already over France when the sky was still empty at those points where, later, were to rise Notre Dame of Paris and Notre Dame of Chartres, when on the summit of the hill of Laon the nave of its cathedral had not yet been poised, like the Ark of the Deluge on the summit of Mount Ararat, crowded with Patriarchs and Judges anxiously leaning from its windows to see whether the wrath of God were yet appeased, carrying with it the types of the vegetation that was to multiply on the earth, brimming over with animals which have escaped even by the towers, where oxen grazing calmly upon the roof look down over the plains of Champagne; when the traveller who left Beauvais at the close of day did not yet see, following him and turning with his road, outspread against the gilded screen of the western sky, the black, ribbed wings of the cathedral. It was, this \u2018Guermantes,\u2019 like the scene of a novel, an imaginary landscape which I could with difficulty picture to myself and longed all the more to discover, set in the midst of real lands and roads which all of a sudden would become alive with heraldic details, within a few miles of a railway station; I recalled the names of the places round it as if they had been situated at the foot of Parnassus or of Helicon, and they seemed precious to me, as the physical conditions \u2014 in the realm of topographical science \u2014 required for the production of an unaccountable phenomenon. I saw again the escutcheons blazoned beneath the windows of Combray church; their quarters filled, century after century, with all the lordships which, by marriage or conquest, this illustrious house had brought flying to it from all the corners of Germany, Italy and France; vast territories in the North, strong cities in the South, assembled there to group themselves in Guermantes, and, losing their material quality, to inscribe allegorically their dungeon vert, or castle triple-towered argent upon its azure field. I had heard of the famous tapestries of Guermantes, I could see them, mediaeval and blue, a trifle coarse, detach themselves like a floating cloud from the legendary, amaranthine name at the foot of the ancient forest in which Childebert went so often hunting; and this delicate, mysterious background of their lands, this vista of the ages, it seemed to me that, as effectively as by journeying to see them, I might penetrate all their secrets simply by coming in contact for a moment in Paris with Mme. de Guermantes, the princess paramount of the place and lady of the lake, as if her face, her speech must possess the local charm of forest groves and streams, and the same secular peculiarities as the old customs recorded in her archives. But then I had met Saint-Loup; he had told me that the castle had borne the name of Guermantes only since the seventeenth century, when that family had acquired it. They had lived, until then, in the neighbourhood, but their title was not taken from those parts. The village of Guermantes had received its name from the castle round which it had been built, and so that it should not destroy the view from the castle, a servitude, still in force, traced the line of its streets and limited the height of its houses. As for the tapestries, they were by Boucher, bought in the nineteenth century by a Guermantes with a taste for the arts, and hung, interspersed with a number of sporting pictures of no merit which he himself had painted, in a hideous drawing-room upholstered in \u2018adrianople\u2019 and plush. By these revelations Saint-Loup had introduced into the castle elements foreign to the name of Guermantes which made it impossible for me to continue to extract solely from the resonance of the syllables the stone and mortar of its walls. And so, in the heart of the name, was effaced the castle mirrored in its lake, and what now became apparent to me, surrounding Mme. de Guermantes as her dwelling, had been her house in Paris, the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes, limpid like its name, for no material and opaque element intervened to interrupt and blind its transparence. As the word church signifies not only the temple but the assembly of the faithful also, this H\u00f4tel de Guermantes comprised all those who shared the life of the Duchess, but these intimates on whom I had never set eyes were for me only famous and poetic names, and knowing exclusively persons who themselves also were names only, did but enhance and protect the mystery of the Duchess by extending all round her a vast halo which at the most declined in brilliance as its circumference increased\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the parties which she gave, since I could not imagine the guests as having any bodies, any moustaches, any boots, as making any utterances that were commonplace, or even original in a human and rational way, this whirlpool of names, introducing less material substance than would a phantom banquet or a spectral ball, round that statuette in Dresden china which was Madame de Guermantes, kept for her palace of glass the transparence of a showcase. Then, after Saint-Loup had told me various anecdotes about his cousin\u2019s chaplain, her gardener, and the rest, the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes had become \u2014 as the Louvre might have been in days gone by \u2014 a kind of castle, surrounded, in the very heart of Paris, by its own domains, acquired by inheritance, by virtue of an ancient right that had quaintly survived, over which she still enjoyed feudal privileges. But this last dwelling itself vanished when we had come to live beside Mme. de Villeparisis in one of the flats adjoining that occupied by Mme. de Guermantes in a wing of the H\u00f4tel. It was one of those old town houses, a few of which are perhaps still to be found, in which the court of honour \u2014 whether they were alluvial deposits washed there by the rising tide of democracy, or a legacy from a more primitive time when the different trades were clustered round the overlord \u2014 is flanked by little shops and workrooms, a shoemaker\u2019s, for instance, or a tailor\u2019s, such as we see nestling between the buttresses of those cathedrals which the aesthetic zeal of the restorer has not swept clear of such accretions; a porter who also does cobbling, keeps hens, grows flowers, and, at the far end, in the main building, a \u2018Comtesse\u2019 who, when she drives out in her old carriage and pair, flaunting on her hat a few nasturtiums which seem to have escaped from the plot by the porter\u2019s lodge (with, by the coachman\u2019s side on the box, a footman who gets down to leave cards at every aristocratic mansion in the neighbourhood), scatters vague little smiles and waves her hand in greeting to the porter\u2019s children and to such of her respectable fellow-tenants as may happen to be passing, who, to her contemptuous affability and levelling pride, seem all the same\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the house in which we had now come to live, the great lady at the end of the courtyard was a Duchess, smart and still quite young. She was, in fact, Mme. de Guermantes and, thanks to Fran\u00e7oise, I soon came to know all about her household. For the Guermantes (to whom Fran\u00e7oise regularly alluded as the people \u2018below,\u2019 or \u2018downstairs\u2019) were her constant preoccupation from the first thing in the morning when, as she did Mamma\u2019s hair, casting a forbidden, irresistible, furtive glance down into the courtyard, she would say: \u201cLook at that, now; a pair of holy Sisters; that\u2019ll be for downstairs, surely;\u201d or, \u201cOh! just look at the fine pheasants in the kitchen window; no need to ask where they came from, the Duke will have been out with his gun!\u201d\u2014 until the last thing at night when, if her ear, while she was putting out my night-things, caught a few notes of a song, she would conclude: \u201cThey\u2019re having company down below; gay doings, I\u2019ll be bound;\u201d whereupon, in her symmetrical face, beneath the arch of her now snow-white hair, a smile from her young days, sprightly but proper, would for a moment set each of her features in its place, arranging them in an intricate and special order, as though for a country-dance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the moment in the life of the Guermantes which excited the keenest interest in Fran\u00e7oise, gave her the most complete satisfaction and at the same time the sharpest annoyance was that at which, the two halves of the great gate having been thrust apart, the Duchess stepped into her carriage. It was generally a little while after our servants had finished the celebration of that sort of solemn passover which none might disturb, called their midday dinner, during which they were so far taboo that my father himself was not allowed to ring for them, knowing moreover that none of them would have paid any more attention to the fifth peal than to the first, and that the discourtesy would therefore have been a pure waste of time and trouble, though not without trouble in store for himself. For Fran\u00e7oise (who, in her old age, lost no opportunity of standing upon her dignity) would without fail have presented him, for the rest of the day, with a face covered with the tiny red cuneiform hieroglyphs by which she made visible \u2014 though by no means legible \u2014 to the outer world the long tale of her griefs and the profound reasons for her dissatisfactions. She would enlarge upon them, too, in a running \u2018aside,\u2019 but not so that we could catch her words. She called this practice \u2014 which, she imagined, must be infuriating, \u2018mortifying\u2019 as she herself put it,\u2018vexing\u2019 to us \u2014\u2018saying low masses all the blessed day.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The last rites accomplished, Fran\u00e7oise, who was at one and the same time, as in the primitive church, the celebrant and one of the faithful, helped herself to a final glass, undid the napkin from her throat, folded it after wiping from her lips a stain of watered wine and coffee, slipped it into its ring, turned a doleful eye to thank \u2018her\u2019 young footman who, to shew his zeal in her service, was saying: \u201cCome, ma\u2019am, a drop more of the grape; it\u2019s d\u2019licious to-day,\u201d and went straight across to the window, which she flung open, protesting that it was too hot to breathe in \u2018this wretched kitchen.\u2019 Dexterously casting, as she turned the latch and let in the fresh air, a glance of studied indifference into the courtyard below, she furtively elicited the conclusion that the Duchess was not ready yet to start, brooded for a moment with contemptuous, impassioned eyes over the waiting carriage, and, this meed of attention once paid to the things of the earth, raised them towards the heavens, whose purity she had already divined from the sweetness of the air and the warmth of the sun; and let them rest on a corner of the roof, at the place where, every spring, there came and built, immediately over the chimney of my bedroom, a pair of pigeons like those she used to hear cooing from her kitchen at Combray\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Combray, Combray!\u201d she cried. And the almost singing tone in which she declaimed this invocation might, taken with the Arlesian purity of her features, have made the onlooker suspect her of a Southern origin and that the lost land which she was lamenting was no more, really, than a land of adoption. If so, he would have been wrong, for it seems that there is no province that has not its own South-country; do we not indeed constantly meet Savoyards and Bretons in whose speech we find all those pleasing transpositions of longs and shorts that are characteristic of the Southerner? \u201cAh, Combray, when shall I look on thee again, poor land! When shall I pass the blessed day among thy hawthorns, under our own poor lily-oaks, hearing the grasshoppers sing, and the Vivonne making a little noise like someone whispering, instead of that wretched bell from our young master, who can never stay still for half an hour on end without having me run the length of that wicked corridor. And even then he makes out I don\u2019t come quick enough; you\u2019d need to hear the bell ring before he has pulled it, and if you\u2019re a minute late, away he flies into the most towering rage. Alas, poor Combray; maybe I shall see thee only in death, when they drop me like a stone into the hollow of the tomb. And so, nevermore shall I smell thy lovely hawthorns, so white and all. But in the sleep of death I dare say I shall still hear those three peals of the bell which will have driven me to damnation in this world.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her soliloquy was interrupted by the voice of the waistcoat-maker downstairs, the same who had so delighted my grandmother once, long ago, when she had gone to pay a call on Mme. de Villeparisis, and now occupied no less exalted a place in Franchise\u2019s affections. Having raised his head when he heard our window open, he had already been trying for some time to attract his neighbour\u2019s attention, in order to bid her good day. The coquetry of the young girl that Fran\u00e7oise had once been softened and refined for M. Jupien the querulous face of our old cook, dulled by age, ill-temper and the heat of the kitchen fire, and it was with a charming blend of reserve, familiarity and modesty that she bestowed a gracious salutation on the waistcoat-maker, but without making any audible response, for if she did infringe Mamma\u2019s orders by looking into the courtyard, she would never have dared to go the length of talking from the window, which would have been quite enough (according to her) to bring down on her \u2018a whole chapter\u2019 from the Mistress. She pointed to the waiting carriage, as who should say: \u201cA fine pair, eh!\u201d though what she actually muttered was: \u201cWhat an old rattle-trap!\u201d but principally because she knew that he would be bound to answer, putting his hand to his lips so as to be audible without having to shout:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou could have one too if you liked, as good as they have and better, I dare say, only you don\u2019t care for that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Franoise, after a modest, evasive signal of delight, the meaning of which was, more or less: \u201cTastes differ, you know; simplicity\u2019s the rule in this house,\u201d shut the window again in case Mamma should come in. These \u2018you\u2019 who might have had more horses than the Guermantes were ourselves, but Jupien was right in saying \u2018you\u2019 since, except for a few purely personal gratifications, such as, when she coughed all day long without ceasing and everyone in the house was afraid of catching her cold, that of pretending, with an irritating little titter, that she had not got a cold, like those plants that an animal to which they are wholly attached keeps alive with food which it catches, eats and digests for them and of which it offers them the ultimate and easily assimilable residue, Fran\u00e7oise lived with us in full community; it was we who, with our virtues, our wealth, our style of living, must take on ourselves the task of concocting those little sops to her vanity out of which was formed \u2014 with the addition of the recognised rights of freely practising the cult of the midday dinner according to the traditional custom, which included a mouthful of air at the window when the meal was finished, a certain amount of loitering in the street when she went out to do her marketing, and a holiday on Sundays when she paid a visit to her niece \u2014 the portion of happiness indispensable to her existence. And so it can be understood that Fran\u00e7oise might well have succumbed in those first days of our migration, a victim, in a house where my father\u2019s claims to distinction were not yet known, to a malady which she herself called \u2018wearying,\u2019 wearying in the active sense in which the word ennui is employed by Corneille, or in the last letters of soldiers who end by taking their own lives because they are wearying for their girls or for their native villages. Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s wearying had soon been cured by none other than Jupien, for he at once procured her a pleasure no less keen, indeed more refined than she would have felt if we had decided to keep a carriage. \u201cVery good class, those Juliens,\u201d (for Fran\u00e7oise readily assimilated new names to those with which she was already familiar) \u201cvery worthy people; you can see it written on their faces.\u201d Jupien was in fact able to understand, and to inform the world that if we did not keep a carriage it was because we had no wish for one. This new friend of Fran\u00e7oise was very little at home, having obtained a post in one of the Government offices. A waistcoat-maker first of all, with the \u2018chit of a girl\u2019 whom my grandmother had taken for his daughter, he had lost all interest in the exercise of that calling after his assistant (who, when still little more than a child, had shewn great skill in darning a torn skirt, that day when my grandmother had gone to call on Mme. de Villeparisis) had turned to ladies\u2019 fashions and become a seamstress. A prentice hand, to begin with, in a dressmaker\u2019s workroom, set to stitch a seam, to fasten a flounce, to sew on a button or to press a crease, to fix a waistband with hooks and eyes, she had quickly risen to be second and then chief assistant, and having formed a connexion of her own among ladies of fashion now worked at home, that is to say in our courtyard, generally with one or two of her young friends from the workroom, whom she had taken on as apprentices. After this, Jupien\u2019s presence in the place had ceased to matter. No doubt the little girl (a big girl by this time) had often to cut out waistcoats still. But with her friends to assist her she needed no one besides. And so Jupien, her uncle, had sought employment outside. He was free at first to return home at midday, then, when he had definitely succeeded the man whose substitute only he had begun by being, not before dinner-time. His appointment to the \u2018regular establishment\u2019 was, fortunately, not announced until some weeks after our arrival, so that his courtesy could be brought to bear on her long enough to help Fran\u00e7oise to pass through the first, most difficult phase without undue suffering. At the same time, and without underrating his value to Fran\u00e7oise as, so to speak, a sedative during the period of transition, I am bound to say that my first impression of Jupien had been far from favourable. At a little distance, entirely ruining the effect that his plump cheeks and vivid colouring would otherwise have produced, his eyes, brimming with a compassionate, mournful, dreamy gaze, led one to suppose that he was seriously ill or had just suffered a great bereavement. Not only was he nothing of the sort, but as soon as he opened his mouth (and his speech, by the way, was perfect) he was quite markedly cynical and cold. There resulted from this discord between eyes and lips a certain falsity which was not attractive, and by which he had himself the air of being made as uncomfortable as a guest who arrives in morning dress at a party where everyone else is in evening dress, or as a commoner who having to speak to a Royal Personage does not know exactly how he ought to address him and gets round the difficulty by cutting down his remarks to almost nothing. Jupien\u2019s (here the comparison ends) were, on the contrary, charming. Indeed, corresponding possibly to this overflowing of his face by his eyes (which one ceased to notice when one came to know him), I soon discerned in him a rare intellect, and one of the most spontaneously literary that it has been my privilege to come across, in the sense that, probably without education, he possessed or had assimilated, with the help only of a few books skimmed in early life, the most ingenious turns of speech. The most gifted people that I had known had died young. And so I was convinced that Jupien\u2019s life would soon be cut short. Kindness was among his qualities, and pity, the most delicate and the most generous feelings for others. But his part in the life of Fran\u00e7oise had soon ceased to be indispensable. She had learned to put up with understudies\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, when a tradesman or servant came to our door with a parcel or message, while seeming to pay no attention and merely pointing vaguely to an empty chair, Fran\u00e7oise so skilfully put to the best advantage the few seconds that he spent in the kitchen, while he waited for Mamma\u2019s answer, that it was very seldom that the stranger went away without having ineradicably engraved upon his memory the conviction that, if we \u2018did not have\u2019 any particular thing, it was because we had \u2018no wish\u2019 for it. If she made such a point of other people\u2019s knowing that we \u2018had money\u2019 (for she knew nothing of what Saint-Loup used to call partitive articles, and said simply \u2018have money,\u2019 \u2018fetch water\u2019), of their realising that we were rich, it was not because riches with nothing else besides, riches without virtue, were in her eyes the supreme good in life; but virtue without riches was not her ideal either. Riches were for her, so to speak, a necessary condition of virtue, failing which virtue itself would lack both merit and charm. She distinguished so little between them that she had come in time to invest each with the other\u2019s attributes, to expect some material comfort from virtue, to discover something edifying in riches\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as she had shut the window again, which she did quickly \u2014 otherwise Mamma would, it appeared, have heaped on her \u2018every conceivable insult\u2019\u2014 Fran\u00e7oise began with many groans and sighs to put straight the kitchen table\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere are some Guermantes who stay in the Rue de la Chaise,\u201d began my father\u2019s valet; \u201cI had a friend who used to be with them; he was their second coachman. And I know a fellow, not my old pal, but his brother-in-law, who did his time in the Army with one of the Baron de Guermantes\u2019s stud grooms. Does your mother know you\u2019re out?\u201d added the valet, who was in the habit, just as he used to hum the popular airs of the season, of peppering his conversation with all the latest witticisms\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise, with the tired eyes of an ageing woman, eyes which moreover saw everything from Combray, in a hazy distance, made out not the witticism that underlay the words, but that there must be something witty in them since they bore no relation to the rest of his speech and had been uttered with considerable emphasis by one whom she knew to be a joker. She smiled at him, therefore, with an air of benevolent bewilderment, as who should say: \u201cAlways the same, that Victor!\u201d And she was genuinely pleased, knowing that listening to smart sayings of this sort was akin \u2014 if remotely \u2014 to those reputable social pleasures for which, in every class of society, people make haste to dress themselves in their best and run the risk of catching cold. Furthermore, she believed the valet to be a friend after her own heart, for he never left off denouncing, with fierce indignation, the appalling measures which the Republic was about to enforce against the clergy. Fran\u00e7oise had not yet learned that our cruellest adversaries are not those who contradict and try to convince us, but those who magnify or invent reports which may make us unhappy, taking care not to include any appearance of justification, which might lessen our discomfort, and perhaps give us some slight regard for a party which they make a point of displaying to us, to complete our torment, as being at once terrible and triumphant\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duchess must be connected with all that lot,\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise, bringing the conversation back to the Guermantes of the Rue de la Chaise, as one plays a piece over again from the andante. \u201cI can\u2019t recall who it was told me that one of them had married a cousin of the Duke. It\u2019s the same kindred, anyway. Ay, they\u2019re a great family, the Guermantes!\u201d she added, in a tone of respect founding the greatness of the family at once on the number of its branches and the brilliance of its connexions, as Pascal founds the truth of Religion on Reason and on the Authority of the Scriptures. For since there was but the single word \u2018great\u2019 to express both meanings, it seemed to her that they formed a single idea, her vocabulary, like cut stones sometimes, shewing thus on certain of its facets a flaw which projected a ray of darkness into the recesses of her mind. \u201cI wonder now if it wouldn\u2019t be them that have their castle at Guermantes, not a score of miles from Combray; then they must be kin to their cousin at Algiers, too.\u201d My mother and I long asked ourselves who this cousin at Algiers could be until finally we discovered that Fran\u00e7oise meant by the name \u2018Algiers\u2019 the town of Angers. What is far off may be more familiar to us than what is quite near. Fran\u00e7oise, who knew the name \u2018Algiers\u2019 from some particularly unpleasant dates that used to be given us at the New Year, had never heard of Angers. Her language, like the French language itself, and especially that of place-names, was thickly strewn with errors. \u201cI meant to talk to their butler about it. What is it again you call him?\u201d she interrupted herself as though putting a formal question as to the correct procedure, which she went on to answer with: \u201cOh, of course, it\u2019s Antoine you call him!\u201d as though Antoine had been a title. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who could tell me, but he\u2019s quite the gentleman, he is, a great scholar, you\u2019d say they\u2019d cut his tongue out, or that he\u2019d forgotten to learn to speak. He makes no response when you talk to him,\u201d went on Fran\u00e7oise, who used \u2018make response\u2019 in the same sense as Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, quite untruthfully, \u201cso long as I know what\u2019s boiling in my pot, I don\u2019t bother my head about what\u2019s in other people\u2019s. Whatever he is, he\u2019s not a Catholic. Besides, he\u2019s not a courageous man.\u201d (This criticism might have led one to suppose that Fran\u00e7oise had changed her mind about physical bravery which, according to her, in Combray days, lowered men to the level of wild beasts. But it was not so. \u2018Courageous\u2019 meant simply a hard worker.) \u201cThey do say, too, that he\u2019s thievish as a magpie, but it doesn\u2019t do to believe all one hears. The servants never stay long there because of the lodge; the porters are jealous and set the Duchess against them. But it\u2019s safe to say that he\u2019s a real twister, that Antoine, and his Antoinesse is no better,\u201d concluded Fran\u00e7oise, who, in furnishing the name \u2018Antoine\u2019 with a feminine ending that would designate the butler\u2019s wife, was inspired, no doubt, in her act of word-formation by an unconscious memory of the words chanoine and chanoinesse. If so, she was not far wrong. There is still a street near Notre-Dame called Rue Chanoinesse, a name which must have been given to it (since it was never inhabited by any but male Canons) by those Frenchmen of olden days of whom Fran\u00e7oise was, properly speaking, the contemporary. She proceeded, moreover, at once to furnish another example of this way of forming feminine endings, for she went on: \u201cBut one thing sure and certain is that it\u2019s the Duchess that has Guermantes Castle. And it\u2019s she that is the Lady Mayoress down in those parts. That\u2019s always something.\u201d\nYou might also like\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can well believe that it is something,\u201d came with conviction from the footman, who had not detected the irony\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou think so, do you, my boy, you think it\u2019s something? Why, for folk like them to be Mayor and Mayoress, it\u2019s just thank you for nothing. Ah, if it was mine, that Guermantes Castle, you wouldn\u2019t see me setting foot in Paris, I can tell you. I\u2019m sure a family who\u2019ve got something to go on with, like Monsieur and Madame here, must have queer ideas to stay on in this wretched town rather than get away down to Combray the moment they\u2019re free to start, and no one hindering them. Why do they put off retiring? They\u2019ve got everything they want. Why wait till they\u2019re dead? Ah, if I had only a crust of dry bread to eat and a faggot to keep me warm in winter, a fine time I\u2019d have of it at home in my brother\u2019s poor old house at Combray. Down there you do feel you\u2019re alive; you haven\u2019t all these houses stuck up in front of you, there is so little noise at night-time, you can hear the frogs singing five miles off and more.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat must indeed be fine!\u201d exclaimed the young footman with enthusiasm, as though this last attraction had been as peculiar to Combray as the gondola is to Venice. A more recent arrival in the household than my father\u2019s valet, he used to talk to Fran\u00e7oise about things which might interest not himself so much as her. And Fran\u00e7oise, whose face wrinkled up in disgust when she was treated as a mere cook, had for the young footman, who referred to her always as the \u2018housekeeper,\u2019 that peculiar tenderness which Princes not of the blood royal feel towards the well-meaning young men who dignify them with a \u2018Highness.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt any rate one knows what one\u2019s about, there, and what time of year it is. It isn\u2019t like here where you won\u2019t find one wretched buttercup flowering at holy Easter any more than you would at Christmas, and I can\u2019t hear so much as the tiniest ang\u00e9lus ring when I lift my old bones out of bed in the morning. Down there, you can hear every hour; there\u2019s only the one poor bell, but you say to yourself: \u2018My brother will be coming in from the field now,\u2019 and you watch the daylight fade, and the bell rings to bless the fruits of the earth, and you have time to take a turn before you light the lamp. But here it\u2019s daytime and it\u2019s nighttime, and you go to bed, and you can\u2019t say any more than the dumb beasts what you\u2019ve been about all day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI gather M\u00e9s\u00e9glise is a fine place, too, Madame,\u201d broke in the young footman, who found that the conversation was becoming a little too abstract for his liking, and happened to remember having heard us, at table, mention M\u00e9s\u00e9glise\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, is it?\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise with the broad smile which one could always bring to her lips by uttering any of those names \u2014 M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, Combray, Tansonville. They were so intimate a part of her life that she felt, on meeting them outside it, on hearing them used in conversation, a hilarity more or less akin to that which a professor excites in his class by making an allusion to some contemporary personage whose name the students had never supposed could possibly greet their ears from the height of the academic chair. Her pleasure arose also from the feeling that these places were something to her which they were not for the rest of the world, old companions with whom one has shared many delights; and she smiled at them as if she found in them something witty, because she did find there a great part of herself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, you may well say so, son, it is a pretty enough place is M\u00e9s\u00e9glise;\u201d she went on with a tinkling laugh, \u201cbut how did you ever come to hear tell of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow did I hear of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise? But it\u2019s a well-known place; people have told me about it \u2014 yes, over and over again,\u201d he assured her with that criminal inexactitude of the informer who, whenever we attempt to form an impartial estimate of the importance that a thing which matters to us may have for other people, makes it impossible for us to succeed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can tell you, it\u2019s better down there, under the cherry trees, than standing before the fire all day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She spoke to them even of Eulalie as a good person. For since Eulalie\u2019s death Fran\u00e7oise had completely forgotten that she had loved her as little in her lifetime as she loved every one whose cupboard was bare, who was dying of hunger, and after that came, like a good for nothing, thanks to the bounty of the rich, to \u2018put on airs.\u2019 It no longer pained her that Eulalie had so skilfully managed, Sunday after Sunday, to secure her \u2018trifle\u2019 from my aunt. As for the latter, Fran\u00e7oise never left off singing her praises\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut it was at Combray, surely, that you used to be, with a cousin of Madame?\u201d asked the young footman\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, with Mme. Octave \u2014 oh, a dear, good, holy woman, my poor friends, and a house where there was always enough and to spare, and all of the very best, a good woman, you may well say, who had no pity on the partridges, or the pheasants, or anything; you might turn up five to dinner or six, it was never the meat that was lacking, and of the first quality too, and white wine, and red wine, and everything you could wish.\u201d (Fran\u00e7oise used the word \u2018pity\u2019 in the sense given it by Labruy\u00e8re.) \u201cIt was she that paid the damages, always, even if the family stayed for months and years.\u201d (This reflection was not really a slur upon us, for Fran\u00e7oise belonged to an epoch when the words \u2018damages\u2019 was not restricted to a legal use and meant simply expense.) \u201cAh, I can tell you, people didn\u2019t go empty away from that house. As his reverence the Cur\u00e9 has told us, many\u2019s the time, if there ever was a woman who could count on going straight before the Throne of God, it was she. Poor Madame, I can hear her saying now, in the little voice she had: \u2018You know, Fran\u00e7oise, I can eat nothing myself, but I want it all to be just as nice for the others as if I could.\u2019 They weren\u2019t for her, the victuals, you may be quite sure. If you\u2019d only seen her, she weighed no more than a bag of cherries; there wasn\u2019t that much of her. She would never listen to a word I said, she would never send for the doctor. Ah, it wasn\u2019t in that house that you\u2019d have to gobble down your dinner. She liked her servants to be fed properly. Here, it\u2019s been just the same again to-day; we haven\u2019t had time for so much as to break a crust of bread; everything goes like ducks and drakes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What annoyed her more than anything were the rusks of pulled bread that my father used to eat. She was convinced that he had them simply to give himself airs and to keep her \u2018dancing.\u2019 \u201cI can tell you frankly,\u201d the young footman assured her, \u201cthat I never saw the like.\u201d He said it as if he had seen everything, and as if in him the range of a millennial experience extended over all countries and their customs, among which was not anywhere to be found a custom of eating pulled bread. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d the butler muttered, \u201cbut that will all be changed; the men are going on strike in Canada, and the Minister told Monsieur the other evening that he\u2019s clearing two hundred thousand francs out of it.\u201d There was no note of censure in his tone, not that he was not himself entirely honest, but since he regarded all politicians as unsound the crime of peculation seemed to him less serious than the pettiest larceny. He did not even stop to ask himself whether he had heard this historic utterance aright, and was not struck by the improbability that such a thing would have been admitted by the guilty party himself to my father without my father\u2019s immediately turning him out of the house. But the philosophy of Combray made it impossible for Fran\u00e7oise to expect that the strikes in Canada could have any repercussion on the use of pulled bread. \u201cSo long as the world goes round, look, there\u2019ll be masters to keep us on the trot, and servants to do their bidding.\u201d In disproof of this theory of perpetual motion, for the last quarter of an hour my mother (who probably did not employ the same measures of time as Fran\u00e7oise in reckoning the duration of the latter\u2019s dinner) had been saying:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat on earth can they be doing? They\u2019ve been at least two hours at their dinner.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she rang timidly three or four times. Fran\u00e7oise, \u2018her\u2019 footman, the butler, heard the bell ring, not as a summons to themselves, and with no thought of answering it, but rather like the first sounds of the instruments being tuned when the next part of a concert is just going to begin, and one knows that there will be only a few minutes more of interval. And so, when the peals were repeated and became more urgent, our servants began to pay attention, and, judging that they had not much time left and that the resumption of work was at hand, at a peal somewhat louder than the rest gave a collective sigh and went their several ways, the footman slipping downstairs to smoke a cigarette outside the door, Fran\u00e7oise, after a string of reflexions on ourselves, such as: \u201cThey\u2019ve got the jumps to-day, surely,\u201d going up to put her things tidy in her attic, while the butler, having supplied himself first with note-paper from my bedroom, polished off the arrears of his private correspondence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the apparent stiffness of their butler, Fran\u00e7oise had been in a position, from the first, to inform me that the Guermantes occupied their mansion by virtue not of an immemorial right but of a quite recent tenancy, and that the garden over which it looked on the side that I did not know was quite small and just like all the gardens along the street; and I realised at length that there were not to be seen there pit and gallows or fortified mill, secret chamber, pillared dovecot, manorial bakehouse or tithe-barn, dungeon or drawbridge, or fixed bridge either for that matter, any more than toll-houses or pinnacles, charters, muniments, ramparts or commemorative mounds. But just as Elstir, when the bay of Balbec, losing its mystery, had become for me simply a portion, interchangeable with any other, of the total quantity of salt water distributed over the earth\u2019s surface, had suddenly restored to it a personality of its own by telling me that it was the gulf of opal, painted by Whistler in his \u2018Harmonies in Blue and Silver,\u2019 so the name Guermantes had seen perish under the strokes of Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s hammer the last of the dwellings that had issued from its syllables when one day an old friend of my father said to us, speaking of the Duchess: \u201cShe is the first lady in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; hers is the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\u201d No doubt the most exclusive drawing-room, the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain was little or nothing after all those other mansions of which in turn I had dreamed. And yet in this one too (and it was to be the last of the series), there was something, however humble, quite apart from its material components, a secret differentiation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it became all the more essential that I should be able to explore in the drawing-room of Mme. de Guermantes, among her friends, the mystery of her name, since I did not find it in her person when I saw her leave the house in the morning on foot, or in the afternoon in her carriage. Once before, indeed, in the church at Combray, she had appeared to me in the blinding flash of a transfiguration, with cheeks irreducible to, impenetrable by, the colour of the name Guermantes and of afternoons on the banks of the Vivonne, taking the place of my shattered dream like a swan or willow into which has been changed a god or nymph, and which henceforward, subjected to natural laws, will glide over the water or be shaken by the wind. And yet, when that radiance had vanished, hardly had I lost sight of it before it formed itself again, like the green and rosy afterglow of sunset after the sweep of the oar has broken it, and in the solitude of my thoughts the name had quickly appropriated to itself my impression of the face. But now, frequently, I saw her at her window, in the courtyard, in the street, and for myself at least if I did not succeed in integrating in her the name Guermantes, I cast the blame on the impotence of my mind to accomplish the whole act that I demanded of it; but she, our neighbour, she seemed to make the same error, nay more to make it without discomfiture, without any of my scruples, without even suspecting that it was an error. Thus Mme. de Guermantes shewed in her dresses the same anxiety to follow the fashions as if, believing herself to have become simply a woman like all the rest, she had aspired to that elegance in her attire in which other ordinary women might equal and perhaps surpass her; I had seen her in the street gaze admiringly at a well-dressed actress; and in the morning, before she sallied forth on foot, as if the opinion of the passers-by, whose vulgarity she accentuated by parading familiarly through their midst her inaccessible life, could be a tribunal competent to judge her, I would see her before the glass playing, with a conviction free from all pretence or irony, with passion, with ill-humour, with conceit, like a queen who has consented to appear as a servant-girl in theatricals at court, this part, so unworthy of her, of a fashionable woman; and in this mythological oblivion of her natural grandeur, she looked to see whether her veil was hanging properly, smoothed her cuffs, straightened her cloak, as the celestial swan performs all the movements natural to his animal species, keeps his eyes painted on either side of his beak without putting into them any glint of life, and darts suddenly after a bud or an umbrella, as a swan would, without remembering that he is a god. But as the traveller, disappointed by the first appearance of a strange town, reminds himself that he will doubtless succeed in penetrating its charm if he visits its museums and galleries, so I assured myself that, had I been given the right of entry into Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s house, were I one of her friends, were I to penetrate into her life, I should then know what, within its glowing orange-tawny envelope, her name did really, objectively enclose for other people, since, after all, my father\u2019s friend had said that the Guermantes set was something quite by itself in the Faubourg Saint-Germain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The life which I supposed them to lead there flowed from a source so different from anything in my experience, and must, I felt, be so indissolubly associated with that particular house that I could not have imagined the presence, at the Duchess\u2019s parties, of people in whose company I myself had already been, of people who really existed. For not being able suddenly to change their nature, they would have carried on conversations there of the sort that I knew; their partners would perhaps have stooped to reply to them in the same human speech; and, in the course of an evening spent in the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, there would have been moments identical with moments that I had already lived. Which was impossible. It was thus that my mind was embarrassed by certain difficulties, and the Presence of Our Lord\u2019s Body in the Host seemed to me no more obscure a mystery than this leading house in the Faubourg, situated here, on the right bank of the river, and so near that from my bed, in the morning, I could hear its carpets being beaten. But the line of demarcation that separated me from the Faubourg Saint-Germain seemed to me all the more real because it was purely ideal. I felt clearly that it was already part of the Faubourg, when I saw the Guermantes doormat, spread out beyond that intangible Equator, of which my mother had made bold to say, having like myself caught a glimpse of it one day when their door stood open, that it was a shocking state. For the rest, how could their dining-room, their dim gallery upholstered in red plush, into which I could see sometimes from our kitchen window, have failed to possess in my eyes the mysterious charm of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, to form part of it in an essential fashion, to be geographically situated within it, since to have been entertained to dinner in that room was to have gone into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, to have breathed its atmosphere, since the people who, before going to table, sat down by the side of Mme. de Guermantes on the leather-covered sofa in that gallery were all of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. No doubt elsewhere than in the Faubourg, at certain parties, one might see now and then, majestically enthroned amid the vulgar herd of fashion, one of those men who were mere names and varyingly assumed, when one tried to form a picture of them, the aspect of a tournament or of a royal forest. But here, in the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-German, in the drawing-room, in the dim gallery, there were only they. They were wrought of precious materials, the columns that upheld the temple. Indeed for quiet family parties it was from among them only that Mme. de Guermantes might select her guests, and in the dinners for twelve, gathered around the dazzling napery and plate, they were like the golden statues of the Apostles in the Sainte-Chapelle, symbolic, consecrative pillars before the Holy Table. As for the tiny strip of garden that stretched between high walls at the back of the house, where on summer evenings Mme. de Guermantes had liqueurs and orangeade brought out after dinner, how could I not have felt that to sit there of an evening, between nine and eleven, on its iron chairs \u2014 endowed with a magic as potent as the leathern sofa \u2014 without inhaling the breezes peculiar to the Faubourg Saint-Germain was as impossible as to take a siesta in the oasis of Figuig without thereby being necessarily in Africa. Only imagination and belief can differentiate from the rest certain objects, certain people, and can create an atmosphere. Alas, those picturesque sites, those natural accidents, those local curiosities, those works of art of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, never probably should I be permitted to set my feet among them. And I must content myself with a shiver of excitement as I sighted, from the deep sea (and without the least hope of ever landing there) like an outstanding minaret, like the first palm, like the first signs of some exotic industry or vegetation, the well-trodden doormat of its shore\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes began for me at its hall-door, its dependencies must be regarded as extending a long way farther, according to the Duke, who, looking on all the other tenants as farmers, peasants, purchasers of forfeited estates, whose opinion was of no account, shaved himself every morning in his nightshirt at the window, came down into the courtyard, according to the warmth or coldness of the day, in his shirtsleeves, in pyjamas, in a plaid coat of startling colours, with a shaggy nap, in little light-coloured coats shorter than the jackets beneath, and made one of his grooms lead past him at a trot some horse that he had just been buying. More than once, indeed, the horse broke the window of Jupien\u2019s shop, whereupon Jupien, to the Duke\u2019s indignation, demanded compensation. \u201cIf it were only in consideration of all the good that Madame la Duchesse does in the house, here, and in the parish,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, \u201cit is an outrage on this fellow\u2019s part to claim a penny from us.\u201d But Jupien had stuck to his point, apparently not having the faintest idea what \u2018good\u2019 the Duchess had ever done. And yet she did do good, but \u2014 since one cannot do good to everybody at once \u2014 the memory of the benefits that we have heaped on one person is a valid reason for our abstaining from helping another, whose discontent we thereby make all the stronger. From other points of view than that of charity the quarter appeared to the Duke \u2014 and this over a considerable area \u2014 to be only an extension of his courtyard, a longer track for his horses. After seeing how a new acquisition trotted by itself he would have it harnessed and taken through all the neighbouring streets, the groom running beside the carriage holding the reins, making it pass to and fro before the Duke who stood on the pavement, erect, gigantic, enormous in his vivid clothes, a cigar between his teeth, his head in the air, his eyeglass scrutinous, until the moment when he sprang on the box, drove the horse up and down for a little to try it, then set off with his new turn-out to pick up his mistress in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. M. de Guermantes bade good day, before leaving the courtyard, to two couples who belonged more or less to his world; the first, some cousins of his who, like working-class parents, were never at home to look after their children, since every morning the wife went off to the Schola to study counterpoint and fugue, and the husband to his studio to carve wood and beat leather; and after them the Baron and Baronne de Norpois, always dressed in black, she like a pew-opener and he like a mute at a funeral, who emerged several times daily on their way to church. They were the nephew and niece of the old Ambassador who was our friend, and whom my father had, in fact, met at the foot of the staircase without realising from where he came; for my father supposed that so important a personage, one who had come in contact with the most eminent men in Europe and was probably quite indifferent to the empty distinctions of rank, was hardly likely to frequent the society of these obscure, clerical and narrow-minded nobles. They had not been long in the place; Jupien, who had come out into the courtyard to say a word to the husband just as he was greeting M. de Guermantes, called him \u2018M. Norpois,\u2019 not being certain of his name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMonsieur Norpois, indeed! Oh, that really is good! Just wait a little! This individual will be calling you Comrade Norpois next!\u201d exclaimed M. de Guermantes, turning to the Baron. He was at last able to vent his spleen against Jupien who addressed him as \u2018Monsieur,\u2019 instead of \u2018Monsieur le Duc.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day when M. de Guermantes required some information upon a matter of which my father had professional knowledge, he had introduced himself to him with great courtesy. After that, he had often some neighbourly service to ask of my father and, as soon as he saw him begin to come downstairs, his mind occupied with his work and anxious to avoid any interruption, the Duke, leaving his stable-boys, would come up to him in the courtyard, straighten the collar of his great-coat, with the serviceable deftness inherited from a line of royal body-servants in days gone by, take him by the hand, and, holding it in his own, patting it even to prove to my father, with a courtesan\u2019s or courtier\u2019s shamelessness, that he, the Duc de Guermantes, made no bargain about my father\u2019s right to the privilege of contact with the ducal flesh, lead him, so to speak, on leash, extremely annoyed and thinking only how he might escape, through the carriage entrance out into the street. He had given us a sweeping bow one day when we had come in just as he was going out in the carriage with his wife; he was bound to have told her my name; but what likelihood was there of her remembering it, or my face either? And besides, what a feeble recommendation to be pointed out simply as being one of her tenants! Another, more valuable, would have been my meeting the Duchess in the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, who, as it happened, had just sent word by my grandmother that I was to go and see her, and, remembering that I had been intending to go in for literature, had added that I should meet several authors there. But my father felt that I was still a little young to go into society, and as the state of my health continued to give him uneasiness he did not see the use of establishing precedents that would do me no good\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As one of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s footmen was in the habit of talking to Fran\u00e7oise, I picked up the names of several of the houses which she frequented, but formed no impression of any of them; from the moment in which they were a part of her life, of that life which I saw only through the veil of her name, were they not inconceivable?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo-night there\u2019s a big party with a Chinese shadow show at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s,\u201d said the footman, \u201cbut we shan\u2019t be going, because at five o\u2019clock Madame is taking the train to Chantilly, to spend a few days with the Due d\u2019Aumale; but it\u2019ll be the lady\u2019s maid and valet that are going with her. I\u2019m to stay here. She won\u2019t be at all pleased, the Princesse de Parme won\u2019t, that\u2019s four times already she\u2019s written to Madame la Duchesse.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen you won\u2019t be going down to Guermantes Castle this year?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we shan\u2019t be going there: it\u2019s because of the Duke\u2019s rheumatics, the doctor says he\u2019s not to go there till the hot pipes are in, but we\u2019ve been there every year till now, right on to January. If the hot pipes aren\u2019t ready, perhaps Madame will go for a few days to Cannes, to the Duchesse de Guise, but nothing\u2019s settled yet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd to the theatre, do you go, sometimes?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe go now and then to the Op\u00e9ra, usually on the evenings when the Princesse de Parme has her box, that\u2019s once a week; it seems it\u2019s a fine show they give there, plays, operas, everything. Madame refused to subscribe to it herself, but we go all the same to the boxes Madame\u2019s friends take, one one night, another another, often with the Princesse de Guermantes, the Duke\u2019s cousin\u2019s lady. She\u2019s sister to the Duke of Bavaria. And so you\u2019ve got to run upstairs again now, have you?\u201d went on the footman, who, albeit identified with the Guermantes, looked upon masters in general as a political estate, a view which allowed him to treat Fran\u00e7oise with as much respect as if she too were in service with a duchess. \u201cYou enjoy good health, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, if it wasn\u2019t for these cursed legs of mine! On the plain I can still get along\u201d (\u2018on the plain\u2019 meant in the courtyard or in the streets, where Fran\u00e7oise had no objection to walking, in other words \u2018on a plane surface\u2019) \u201cbut it\u2019s these stairs that do me in, devil take them. Good day to you, sir, see you again, perhaps, this evening.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was all the more anxious to continue her conversations with the footman after he mentioned to her that the sons of dukes often bore a princely title which they retained until their fathers were dead. Evidently the cult of the nobility, blended with and accommodating itself to a certain spirit of revolt against it, must, springing hereditarily from the soil of France, be very strongly implanted still in her people. For Fran\u00e7oise, to whom you might speak of the genius of Napoleon or of wireless telegraphy without succeeding in attracting her attention, and without her slackening for an instant the movements with which she was scraping the ashes from the grate or laying the table, if she were simply to be told these idiosyncrasies of nomenclature, and that the younger son of the Duc de Guermantes was generally called Prince d\u2019Ol\u00e9ron, would at once exclaim: \u201cThat\u2019s fine, that is!\u201d and stand there dazed, as though in contemplation of a stained window in church\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise learned also from the Prince d\u2019Agrigente\u2019s valet, who had become friends with her by coming often to the house with notes for the Duchess, that he had been hearing a great deal of talk in society about the marriage of the Marquis de Saint-Loup to Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac, and that it was practically settled\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That villa, that opera-box, into which Mme. de Guermantes transfused the current of her life, must, it seemed to me, be places no less fairylike than her home. The names of Guise, of Parme, of Guermantes-Baviere, differentiated from all possible others the holiday places to which the Duchess resorted, the daily festivities which the track of her bowling wheels bound, as with ribbons, to her mansion. If they told me that in those holidays, in those festivities, consisted serially the life of Mme. de Guermantes, they brought no further light to bear on it. Each of them gave to the life of the Duchess a different determination, but succeeded only in changing the mystery of it, without allowing to escape any of its own mystery which simply floated, protected by a covering, enclosed in a bell, through the tide of the life of all the world. The Duchess might take her luncheon on the shore of the Mediterranean at Carnival time, but, in the villa of Mme. de Guise, where the queen of Parisian society was nothing more, in her white linen dress, among numberless princesses, than a guest like any of the rest, and on that account more moving still to me, more herself by being thus made new, like a star of the ballet who in the fantastic course of a figure takes the place of each of her humbler sisters in succession; she might look at Chinese shadow shows, but at a party given by the Princesse de Parme, listen to tragedy or opera, but from the box of the Princesse de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we localise in the body of a person all the potentialities of that person\u2019s life, our recollections of the people he knows and has just left or is on his way to meet, if, having learned from Fran\u00e7oise that Mme. de Guermantes was going on foot to luncheon with the Princesse de Parme, I saw her, about midday, emerge from her house in a gown of flesh-coloured satin over which her face was of the same shade, like a cloud that rises above the setting sun, it was all the pleasures of the Faubourg Saint-Germain that I saw before me, contained in that small compass, as in a shell, between its twin valves that glowed with roseate nacre\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father had a friend at the Ministry, one A. J. Moreau, who, to distinguish him from the other Moreaus, took care always to prefix both initials to his name, with the result that people called him, for short, \u2018A.J.\u2019 Well, somehow or other, this A. J. found himself entitled to a stall at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique on a gala night, he sent the ticket to my father, and as Berma, whom I had not been again to see since my first disappointment, was to give an act of Ph\u00e8dre, my grandmother persuaded my father to pass it on to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To tell the truth, I attached no importance to this possibility of hearing Berma which, a few years earlier, had plunged me in such a state of agitation. And it was not without a sense of melancholy that I realized the fact of my indifference to what at one time I had put before health, comfort, everything. It was not that there had been any slackening of my desire for an opportunity to contemplate close at hand the precious particles of reality of which my imagination caught a broken glimpse. But my imagination no longer placed these in the diction of a great actress; since my visits to Elstir, it was on certain tapestries, certain modern paintings that I had brought to bear the inner faith I had once had in this acting, in this tragic art of Berma; my faith, my desire, no longer coming forward to pay incessant worship to the diction, the attitudes of Berma, the counterpart that I possessed of them in my heart had gradually perished, like those other counterparts of the dead in ancient Egypt which had to be fed continually in order to maintain their originals in eternal life. This art had become a feeble, tawdry thing. No deep-lying soul inhabited it any more\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That evening, as, armed with the ticket my father had received from his friend, I was climbing the grand staircase of the Opera, I saw in front of me a man whom I took at first for M. de Charlus, whose bearing he had; when he turned his head to ask some question of one of the staff I saw that I had been mistaken, but I had no hesitation in placing the stranger in the same class of society, from the way not only in which he was dressed but in which he spoke to the man who took the tickets and to the box-openers who were keeping him waiting. For, apart from personal details of similarity, there was still at this period between any smart and wealthy man of that section of the nobility and any smart and wealthy man of the world of finance or \u2018big business\u2019 a strongly marked difference. Where one of the latter would have thought he was giving proof of his exclusiveness by adopting a sharp, haughty tone in speaking to an inferior, the great gentleman, affable, pleasant, smiling, had the air of considering, practising an affectation of humility and patience, a pretence of being just one of the audience, as a privilege of his good breeding. It is quite likely that, on seeing him thus dissemble behind a smile overflowing with good nature the barred threshold of the little world apart which he carried in his person, more than one wealthy banker\u2019s son, entering the theatre at that moment, would have taken this great gentleman for a person of no importance if he had not remarked in him an astonishing resemblance to the portrait that had recently appeared in the illustrated papers of a nephew of the Austrian Emperor, the Prince of Saxony, who happened to be in Paris at the time. I knew him to be a great friend of the Guermantes. As I reached the attendant I heard the Prince of Saxony (or his double) say with a smile: \u201cI don\u2019t know the number; it was my cousin who told me I had only to ask for her box.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He may well have been the Prince of Saxony; it was perhaps of the Duchesse de Guermantes (whom, in that event, I should be able to watch in the process of living one of those moments of her unimaginable life in her cousin\u2019s box) that his eyes formed a mental picture when he referred to \u2018my cousin who told me I had only to ask for her box,\u2019 so much so that that smiling gaze peculiar to himself, those so simple words caressed my heart (far more gently than would any abstract meditation) with the alternative feelers of a possible happiness and a vague distinction. Whatever he was, in uttering this sentence to the attendant he grafted upon a commonplace evening in my everyday life a potential outlet into a new world; the passage to which he was directed after mentioning the word \u2018box\u2019 and along which he now proceeded was moist and mildewed and seemed to lead to subaqueous grottoes, to the mythical kingdom of the water-nymphs. I had before me a gentleman in evening dress who was walking away from me, but I kept playing upon and round him, as with a badly fitting reflector on a lamp, and without ever succeeding in making it actually coincide with him, the idea that he was the Prince of Saxony and was on his way to join the Duchesse de Guermantes. And, for all that he was alone, that idea, external to himself, impalpable, immense, unstable as the shadow projected by a magic lantern, seemed to precede and guide him like that deity, invisible to the rest of mankind, who stands beside the Greek warrior in the hour of battle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I took my seat, striving all the time to recapture a line from Ph\u00e8dre which I could not quite remember. In the form in which I repeated it to myself it had not the right number of feet, but as I made no attempt to count them, between its unwieldiness and a classical line of poetry it seemed as though no common measure could exist. It would not have surprised me to learn that I must subtract at least half a dozen syllables from that portentous phrase to reduce it to alexandrine dimensions. But suddenly I remembered it, the irremediable asperities of an inhuman world vanished as if by magic; the syllables of the line at once filled up the requisite measure, what there was in excess floated off with the ease, the dexterity of a bubble of air that rises to burst on the water\u2019s brink. And, after all, this excrescence with which I had been struggling consisted of but a single foot\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A certain number of orchestra stalls had been offered for sale at the box office and bought, out of snobbishness or curiosity, by such as wished to study the appearance of people whom they might not have another opportunity of seeing at close quarters. And it was indeed a fragment of their true social life, ordinarily kept secret, that one could examine here in public, for, the Princesse de Parme having herself distributed among her friends the seats in stalls, balconies and boxes, the house was like a drawing-room in which everyone changed his place, went to sit here or there wherever he caught sight of a woman whom he knew\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next to me were some common people who, not knowing the regular subscribers, were anxious to shew that they were capable of identifying them and named them aloud. They went on to remark that these subscribers behaved there as though they were in their own drawing-rooms, meaning that they paid no attention to what was being played. Which was the exact opposite of what did happen. A budding genius who had taken a stall in order to hear Berma thinks only of not soiling his gloves, of not disturbing, of making friends with the neighbour whom chance has put beside him, of pursuing with an intermittent smile the fugitive \u2014 avoiding with apparent want of politeness the intercepted gaze of a person of his acquaintance whom he has discovered in the audience and to whom, after a thousand indecisions, he makes up his mind to go and talk just as the three hammer-blows from the stage, sounding before he has had time to reach his friend, force him to take flight, like the Hebrews in the Red Sea, through a heaving tide of spectators and spectatresses whom he has obliged to rise and whose dresses he tears as he passes, or tramples on their boots. On the other hand it was because the society people sat in their boxes (behind the general terrace of the balcony, as in so many little drawing-rooms, the fourth walls of which had been removed, or in so many little caf\u00e9s, to which one might go for refreshment, without letting oneself be intimidated by the mirrors in gilt frames or the red plush seats, in the Neapolitan style, of the establishment), it was because they rested an indifferent hand on the gilded shafts of the columns which upheld this temple of the lyric art, it was because they remained unmoved by the extravagant honours which seemed to be being paid them by a pair of carved figures which held out towards the boxes branches of palm and laurel, that they and they only would have had minds free to listen to the play, if only they had had minds\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At first there was nothing visible but vague shadows, in which one suddenly struck \u2014 like the gleam of a precious stone which one cannot see \u2014 the phosphorescence of a pair of famous eyes, or, like a medallion of Henri IV on a dark background, the bent profile of the Due d\u2019Aumale, to whom an invisible lady was exclaiming \u201cMonseigneur must allow me to take his coat,\u201d to which the Prince replied, \u201cOh, come, come! Really, Madame d\u2019Ambresac.\u201d She took it, in spite of this vague prohibition, and was envied by all the rest her being thus honoured\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But in the other boxes, everywhere almost, the white deities who inhabited those sombre abodes had flown for shelter against their shadowy walls and remained invisible. Gradually, however, as the performance went on, their vaguely human forms detached themselves, one by one, from the shades of night which they patterned, and, raising themselves towards the light, allowed their semi-nude bodies to emerge, and rose, and stopped at the limit of their course, at the luminous, shaded surface on which their brilliant faces appeared behind the gaily breaking foam of the feather fans they unfurled and lightly waved, beneath their hyacinthine locks begemmed with pearls, which the flow of the tide seemed to have caught and drawn with it; this side of them, began the orchestra stalls, abode of mortals for ever separated from the transparent, shadowy realm to which, at points here and there, served as boundaries, on its brimming surface, the limpid, mirroring eyes of the water-nymphs. For the folding seats on its shore, the forms of the monsters in the stalls were painted upon the surface of those eyes in simple obedience to the laws of optics and according to their angle of incidence, as happens with those two sections of external reality to which, knowing that they do not possess any soul, however rudimentary, that can be considered as analogous to our own, we should think ourselves mad if we addressed a smile or a glance of recognition: namely, minerals and people to whom we have not been introduced. Beyond this boundary, withdrawing from the limit of their domain, the radiant daughters of the sea kept turning at every moment to smile up at the bearded tritons who clung to the anfractuosities of the cliff, or towards some aquatic demi-god, whose head was a polished stone to which the tides had borne a smooth covering of seaweed, and his gaze a disc of rock crystal. They leaned towards these creatures, offering them sweetmeats; sometimes the flood parted to admit a fresh Nereid who, belated, smiling, apologetic, had just floated into blossom out of the shadowy depths; then, the act ended, having no further hope of hearing the melodious sounds of earth which had drawn them to the surface, plunging back all in a moment the several sisters vanished into the night. But of all these retreats, to the thresholds of which their mild desire to behold the works of man brought the curious goddesses who let none approach them, the most famous was the cube of semi-darkness known to the world as the stage box of the Princesse de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like a mighty goddess who presides from far aloft over the sports of lesser deities, the Princess had deliberately remained a little way back on a sofa placed sideways in the box, red as a reef of coral, beside a big, glassy splash of reflexion which was probably a mirror and made one think of the section cut by a ray of sunlight, vertical, clear, liquid, through the flashing crystal of the sea. At once plume and blossom, like certain subaqueous growths, a great white flower, downy as the wing of a bird, fell from the brow of the Princess along one of her cheeks, the curve of which it followed with a pliancy, coquettish, amorous, alive, and seemed almost to enfold it like a rosy egg in the softness of a halcyon\u2019s nest. Over her hair, reaching in front to her eyebrows and caught back lower down at the level of her throat, was spread a net upon which those little white shells which are gathered on some shore of the South Seas alternated with pearls, a marine mosaic barely emerging from the waves and at every moment plunged back again into a darkness in the depths of which even then a human presence was revealed by the ubiquitous flashing of the Princess\u2019s eyes. The beauty which set her far above all the other fabulous daughters of the dusk was not altogether materially and comprehensively inscribed on her neck, her shoulders, her arms, her figure. But the exquisite, unfinished line of the last was the exact starting point, the inevitable focus of invisible lines which the eye could not help prolonging, marvellous lines, springing into life round the woman like the spectrum of an ideal form projected upon the screen of darkness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s the Princesse de Guermantes,\u201d said my neighbour to the gentleman beside her, taking care to begin the word \u2018Princesse\u2019 with a string of P\u2019s, to shew that a title like that was absurd. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been sparing with her pearls. I\u2019m sure, if I had as many as that, I wouldn\u2019t make such a display of them; it doesn\u2019t look at all well, not to my mind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, when they caught sight of the Princess, all those who were looking round to see who was in the audience felt springing up for her in their hearts the rightful throne of beauty. Indeed, with the Duchesse de Luxembourg, with Mme. de Morienval, with Mme. de Saint-Euverte, and any number of others, what enabled one to identify their faces would be the juxtaposition of a big red nose to a hare-lip, or of a pair of wrinkled cheeks to a faint moustache. These features were nevertheless sufficient in themselves to attract the eye, since having merely the conventional value of a written document they gave one to read a famous and impressive name; but also they gave one, cumulatively, the idea that ugliness had about it something aristocratic, and that it was unnecessary that the face of a great lady, provided it was distinguished, should be beautiful as well. But like certain artists who, instead of the letters of their names, set at the foot of their canvas a form that is beautiful in itself, a butterfly, a lizard, a flower, so it was the form of a delicious face and figure that the Princess had put in the corner of her box, thereby shewing that beauty can be the noblest of signatures; for the presence there of Mme. de Guermantes-Bavi\u00e8re, who brought to the theatre only such persons as at other times formed part of her intimate circle, was in the eyes of specialists in aristocracy the best possible certificate of the authenticity of the picture which her box presented, a sort of evocation of a scene in the ordinary private life of the Princess in her palaces in Munich and in Paris\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our imagination being like a barrel organ out of order, which always plays some other tune than that shewn on its card, every time that I had heard any mention of the Princesse de Guermantes-Bavi\u00e8re, a recollection of certain sixteenth-century masterpieces had begun singing in my brain. I was obliged to rid myself quickly of this association, now that I saw her engaged in offering crystallised fruit to a stout gentleman in a swallowtail coat. Certainly I was very far from the conclusion that she and her guests were mere human beings like the rest of the audience. I understood that what they were doing there was all only a game, and that as a prelude to the acts of their real life (of which, presumably, this was not where they spent the important part) they had arranged, in obedience to a ritual unknown to me, they were feigning to offer and decline sweetmeats, a gesture robbed of its ordinary significance and regulated beforehand like the step of a dancer who alternately raises herself on her toes and circles about an upheld scarf. For all I knew, perhaps at the moment of offering him her sweetmeats the goddess was saying, with that note of irony in her voice (for I saw her smile): \u201cDo have one, won\u2019t you?\u201d What mattered that to me? I should have found a delicious refinement in the deliberate dryness, in the style of M\u00e9rim\u00e9e or Meilhac, of such words addressed by a goddess to a demi-god who, conscious himself what were the sublime thoughts which they both had in their minds, in reserve, doubtless, until the moment when they would begin again to live their true life, consenting to join in the game, was answering with the same mysterious bitterness: \u201cThanks; I should like a cherry.\u201d And I should have listened to this dialogue with the same avidity as to a scene from Le Mari de la D\u00e9butante, where the absence of poetry, of lofty thoughts, things so familiar to me which, I suppose, Meilhac could easily, had he chosen, have put into it a thousand times over, seemed to me in itself a refinement, a conventional refinement and therefore all the more mysterious and instructive\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat fat fellow is the Marquis de Ganan\u00e7ay,\u201d came in a knowing tone from the man next to me, who had not quite caught the name whispered in the row behind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Marquis de Palancy, his face bent downwards at the end of his long neck, his round bulging eye glued to the glass of his monocle, was moving with a leisurely displacement through the transparent shade and appeared no more to see the public in the stalls than a fish that drifts past, unconscious of the press of curious gazers, behind the glass wall of an aquarium. Now and again he paused, a venerable, wheezing monument, and the audience could not have told whether he was in pain, asleep, swimming, about to spawn, or merely taking breath. No one else aroused in me so much envy as he, on account of his apparent familiarity with this box and the indifference with which he allowed the Princess to hold out to him her box of sweetmeats; throwing him, at the same time, a glance from her fine eyes, cut in a pair of diamonds which at such moments wit and friendliness seemed to liquefy, whereas, when they were at rest, reduced to their purely material beauty, to their mineral brilliance alone, if the least reflected flash disturbed them ever so slightly, they set the darkness ablaze with inhuman horizontal splendid fires. But now, because the act ofPh\u00e8dre in which Berma was playing was due to start, the Princess came to the front of the box; whereupon, as if she herself were a theatrical production, in the zone of light which she traversed, I saw not only the colour but the material of her adornments change. And in the box, dry now, emerging, a part no longer of the watery realm, the Princess, ceasing to be a Nereid, appeared turbanned in white and blue like some marvellous tragic actress dressed for the part of Za\u00efre, or perhaps of Orosmane; finally, when she had taken her place in the front row I saw that the soft halcyon\u2019s nest which tenderly shielded the rosy nacre of her cheeks was \u2014 downy, dazzling, velvety, an immense bird of paradise\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But now my gaze was diverted from the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s box by a little woman who came in, ill-dressed, plain, her eyes ablaze with indignation, followed by two young men, and sat down a few places from me. At length the curtain went up. I could not help being saddened by the reflexion that there remained now no trace of my old disposition, at the period when, so as to miss nothing of the extraordinary phenomenon which I would have gone to the ends of the earth to see, I kept my mind prepared, like the sensitive plates which astronomers take out to Africa, to the West Indies, to make and record an exact observation of a comet or an eclipse; when I trembled for fear lest some cloud (a fit of ill humour on the artist\u2019s part or an incident in the audience) should prevent the spectacle from presenting itself with the maximum of intensity; when I should not have believed that I was watching it in the most perfect conditions had I not gone to the very theatre which was consecrated to it like an altar, in which I then felt to be still a part of it, though an accessory part only, the officials with their white carnations, appointed by her, the vaulted balcony covering a pit filled with a shabbily dressed crowd, the women selling programmes that had her photograph, the chestnut trees in the square outside, all those companions, those confidants of my impressions of those days which seemed to me to be inseparable from them. Ph\u00e8dre, the \u2018Declaration Scene,\u2019 Berma, had had then for me a sort of absolute existence. Standing aloof from the world of current experience they existed by themselves, I must go to meet them, I should penetrate what I could of them, and if I opened my eyes and soul to their fullest extent I should still absorb but a very little of them. But how pleasant life seemed to me: the triviality of the form of it that I myself was leading mattered nothing, no more than the time we spend on dressing, on getting ready to go out, since, transcending it, there existed in an absolute form, good and difficult to approach, impossible to possess in their entirety, those more solid realities,  Ph\u00e8dre and the way in which Berma spoke her part. Steeped in these dreams of perfection in the dramatic art (a strong dose of which anyone who had at that time subjected my mind to analysis at any moment of the day or even the night would have been able to prepare from it), I was like a battery that accumulates and stores up electricity. And a time had come when, ill as I was, even if I had believed that I should die of it, I should still have been compelled to go and hear Berma. But now, like a hill which from a distance seems a patch of azure sky, but, as we draw nearer, returns to its place in our ordinary field of vision, all this had left the world of the absolute and was no more than a thing like other things, of which I took cognisance because I was there, the actors were people of the same substance as the people I knew, trying to speak in the best possible way these lines of Ph\u00e8dre, which themselves no longer formed a sublime and individual essence, distinct from everything else, but were simply more or less effective lines ready to slip back into the vast corpus of French poetry, of which they were merely a part. I felt a discouragement that was all the more profound in that, if the object of my headstrong and active desire no longer existed, the same tendencies, on the other hand, to indulge in a perpetual dream, which varied from year to year but led me always to sudden impulses, regardless of danger, still persisted. The day on which I rose from my bed of sickness and set out to see, in some country house or other, a picture by Elstir or a mediaeval tapestry, was so like the day on which I ought to have started for Venice, or that on which I did go to hear Berma, or start for Balbec, that I felt before going that the immediate object of my sacrifice would, after a little while, leave me cold, that then I might pass close by the place without stopping even to look at that picture, those tapestries for which I would at this moment risk so many sleepless nights, so many hours of pain. I discerned in the instability of its object the vanity of my effort, and at the same time its vastness, which I had not before noticed, like a neurasthenic whose exhaustion we double by pointing out to him that he is exhausted. In the meantime my musings gave a distinction to everything that had any connexion with them. And even in my most carnal desires, magnetised always in a certain direction, concentrated about a single dream, I might have recognised as their primary motive an idea, an idea for which I would have laid down my life, at the innermost core of which, as in my day dreams while I sat reading all afternoon in the garden at Combray, lay the thought of perfection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I no longer felt the same indulgence as on the former occasion towards the deliberate expressions of affection or anger which I had then remarked in the delivery and gestures of Aricie, Ism\u00e8ne and Hippolyte. It was not that the players \u2014 they were the same, by the way \u2014 did not still seek, with the same intelligent application, to impart now a caressing inflexion, or a calculated ambiguity to their voices, now a tragic amplitude, or a suppliant meekness to their movements. Their intonations bade the voice: \u201cBe gentle, sing like a nightingale, caress and woo\u201d; or else, \u201cnow wax furious,\u201d and then hurled themselves upon it, trying to carry it off with them in their frenzied rush. But it, mutinous, independent of their diction, remained unalterably their natural voice with its material defects or charms, its everyday vulgarity or affectation, and thus presented a sum-total of acoustic or social phenomena which the sentiment contained in the lines they were repeating was powerless to alter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly the gestures of the players said to their arms, to their garments: \u201cBe majestic.\u201d But each of these unsubmissive members allowed to flaunt itself between shoulder and elbow a biceps which knew nothing of the part; they continued to express the triviality of everyday life and to bring into prominence, instead of fine shades of Racinian meaning, mere muscular attachments; and the draperies which they held up fell back again along vertical lines in which the natural law that governs falling bodies was challenged only by an insipid textile pliancy. At this point the little woman who was sitting near me exclaimed:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot a hand! Did you ever see such a get-up? She\u2019s too old; she can\u2019t play the part; she ought to have retired ages ago.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amid a sibilant protest from their neighbours the two young men with her succeeded in making her keep quiet and her fury raged now only in her eyes. This fury could, moreover, be prompted only by the thought of success, of fame, for Berma, who had earned so much money, was overwhelmed with debts. Since she was always making business or social appointments which she was prevented from keeping, she had messengers flying with apologies along every street in Paris, and what with rooms in hotels which she would never occupy engaged in advance, oceans of scent to bathe her dogs, heavy penalties for breaches of contract with all her managers, failing any more serious expense and being not so voluptuous as Cleopatra, she would have found the means of squandering on telegrams and jobmasters provinces and kingdoms. But the little woman was an actress who had never tasted success, and had vowed a deadly hatred against Berma. The latter had just corne on to the stage. And then \u2014 oh, the miracle \u2014 like those lessons which we laboured in vain to learn overnight, and find intact, got by heart, on waking up next morning, like, too, those faces of dead friends which the impassioned efforts of our memory pursue without recapturing them, and which, when we are no longer thinking of them, are there before our eyes just as they were in life \u2014 the talent of Berma, which had evaded me when I sought so greedily to seize its essential quality, now, after these years of oblivion, in this hour of indifference, imposed itself, with all the force of a thing directly seen, on my admiration. Formerly, in my attempts to isolate the talent, I deducted, so to speak, from what I heard the part itself, a part common to all the actresses who appeared as Ph\u00e8dre, which I had myself studied beforehand so that I might be capable of subtracting it, of receiving in the strained residue only the talent of Mme. Berma. But this talent which I sought to discover outside the part itself was indissolubly one with it. So with a great musician (it appears that this was the case with Vinteuil when he played the piano), his playing is that of so fine a pianist that one cannot even be certain whether the performer is a pianist at all, since (not interposing all that mechanism of muscular effort, crowned here and there with brilliant effects, all that spattering shower of notes in which at least the listener who does not quite know where he is thinks that he can discern talent in its material, tangible objectivity) his playing is become so transparent, so full of what he is interpreting, that himself one no longer sees and he is nothing now but a window opening upon a great work of art. The intentions which surrounded, like a majestic or delicate border, the voice and mimicry of Aricie, Ism\u00e8ne or Hippolyte I had been able to distinguish, but Ph\u00e8dre had taken hers into herself, and my mind had not succeeded in wresting from her diction and attitudes, in apprehending in the miserly simplicity of their unbroken surfaces those treasures, those effects of which no sign emerged, so completely had they been absorbed. Berma\u2019s voice, in which not one atom of lifeless matter refractory to the mind remained undissolved, did not allow any sign to be discernible around it of that overflow of tears which one could feel, because they had not been able to absorb it in themselves, trickling over the marble voice of Aricie or Ism\u00e8ne, but had been brought to an exquisite perfection in each of its tiniest cells like the instrument of a master violinist, in whom one means, when one says that his music has a fine sound, to praise not a physical peculiarity but a superiority of soul; and, as in the classical landscape where in the place of a vanished nymph there is an inanimate waterspring, a clear and concrete intention had been transformed into a certain quality of tone, strangely, appropriately, coldly limpid. Berma\u2019s arms, which the lines themselves, by the same dynamic force that made the words issue from her lips, seemed to raise on to her bosom like leaves disturbed by a gush o\u00ee water; her attitude, on the stage, which she had gradually built up, which she was to modify yet further, and which was based upon reasonings of a different profundity from those of which traces might be seen in the gestures of her fellow-actors, but of reasonings that had lost their original deliberation, and had melted into a sort of radiance in which they sent throbbing, round the person of the heroine, elements rich and complex, but which the fascinated spectator took not as an artistic triumph but as a natural gift; those white veils themselves, which, tenuous and clinging, seemed to be of a living substance and to have been woven by the suffering, half-pagan, half-Jansenist, around which they drew close like a frail, shrinking chrysalis; all of them, voice, attitude, gestures, veils, were nothing more, round this embodiment of an idea, which a line of poetry is (an embodiment that, unlike our human bodies, covers the soul not with an opaque screen which prevents us from seeing it, but with a purified, a quickened garment through which the soul is diffused and we discover it), than additional envelopes which instead of concealing shewed up in greater splendour the soul that had assimilated them to itself and had spread itself through them, than layers of different substances, grown translucent, the interpolation of which has the effect only of causing a richer refraction of the imprisoned, central ray that pierces through them, and of making more extensive, more precious and more fair the matter purified by fire in which it is enshrined. So Berma\u2019s interpretation was, around Racine\u2019s work, a second work, quickened also by the breath of genius\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My own impression, to tell the truth, though more pleasant than on the earlier occasion, was not really different. Only, I no longer put it to the test of a pre-existent, abstract and false idea of dramatic genius, and I understood now that dramatic genius was precisely this. It had just occurred to me that if I had not derived any pleasure from my first hearing of Berma, it was because, as earlier still when I used to meet Gilberte in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, I had come to her with too strong a desire. Between my two disappointments there was perhaps not only this resemblance, but another more profound. The impression given us by a person or a work (or a rendering, for that matter) of marked individuality is peculiar to that person or work. We have brought to it the ideas of \u2018beauty,\u2019 \u2018breadth of style,\u2019 \u2018pathos\u2019 and so forth which we might, failing anything better, have had the illusion of discovering in the commonplace show of a \u2018correct\u2019 face or talent, but our critical spirit has before it the insistent challenge of a form of which it possesses no intellectual equivalent, in which it must detect and isolate the unknown element. It hears a shrill sound, an oddly interrogative intonation. It asks itself: \u201cIs that good? Is what I am feeling just now admiration? Is that richness of colouring, nobility, strength?\u201d And what answers it again is a shrill voice, a curiously questioning tone, the despotic impression caused by a person whom one does not know, wholly material, in which there is no room left for \u2018breadth of interpretation.\u2019 And for this reason it is the really beautiful works that, if we listen to them with sincerity, must disappoint us most keenly, because in the storehouse of our ideas there is none that corresponds to an individual impression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was precisely what Berma\u2019s acting shewed me. This was what was meant by nobility, by intelligence of diction. Now I could appreciate the worth of a broad, poetical, powerful interpretation, or rather it was to this that those epithets were conventionally applied, but only as we give the names of Mars, Venus, Saturn to planets which have no place in classical mythology. We feel in one world, we think, we give names to things in another; between the two we can establish a certain correspondence, but not bridge the interval. It was quite narrow, this interval, this fault that I had had to cross when, that afternoon on which I went first to bear Berma, having strained my ears to catch every word, I had found some difficulty in correlating my ideas of \u2018nobility of interpretation,\u2019 of \u2018originality,\u2019 and had broken out in applause only after a moment of unconsciousness and as if my applause sprang not from my actual impression but was connected in some way with my preconceived ideas, with the pleasure that I found in saying to myself: \u201cAt last I am listening to Berma.\u201d And the difference that there is between a person, or a work of art which is markedly individual and the idea of beauty, exists just as much between what they make us feel and the idea of love, or of admiration. Wherefore we fail to recognise them. I had found no pleasure in listening to Berma (any more than, earlier still, in seeing Gilberte). I had said to myself: \u201cWell, I do not admire this.\u201d But then I was thinking only of mastering the secret of Berma\u2019s acting, I was preoccupied with that alone, I was trying to open my mind as wide as possible to receive all that her acting contained. I understood now that all this amounted to nothing more nor less than admiration\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This genius of which Berma\u2019s rendering of the part was only the revelation, was it indeed the genius of Racine and nothing more?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I thought so at first. I was soon to be undeceived when the curtain fell on the act from Ph\u00e8dre, amid enthusiastic recalls from the audience, through which the old actress, beside herself with rage, drawing her little body up to its full height, turning sideways in her seat, stiffened the muscles of her face and folded her arms on her bosom to shew that she was not joining the others in their applause, and to make more noticeable a protest which to her appeared sensational though it passed unperceived. The piece that followed was one of those novelties which at one time I had expected, since they were not famous, to be inevitably trivial and of no general application, devoid as they were of any existence outside the performance that was being given of them at the moment. But I had not with them as with a classic the disappointment of seeing the infinity and eternity of a masterpiece occupy no more space or time than the width of the footlights and the length of a performance which would finish it as effectively as a piece written for the occasion. Besides, at every fresh passage which, I felt, had appealed to the audience and would onc day be famous, in place of the fame which it was prevented from having won in the past I added that which it would enjoy in the future, by a mental process the converse of that which consists in imagining masterpieces on the day of their first thin performance, when it seemed inconceivable that a title which no one had ever heard before could one day be set, bathed in the same mellow light, beside those of the author\u2019s other works. And this part would be set one day in the list of her finest impersonations, next to that of Ph\u00e8dre. Not that in itself it was not destitute of all literary merit. But Berma was as sublime in one as in the other. I realised then that the work of the playwright was for the actress no more than the material, the nature of which was comparatively unimportant, for the creation of her masterpiece of interpretation, just as the great painter whom I had met at Balbec, Elstir, had found the inspiration for two pictures of equal merit in a school building without any character and a cathedral which was in itself a work of art. And as the painter dissolves houses, carts, people, in some broad effect of light which makes them all alike, so Berma spread out great sheets of terror or tenderness over words that were all melted together in a common mould, lowered or raised to one level, which a lesser artist would have carefully detached from one another. No doubt each of them had an inflexion of its own, and Berma\u2019s diction did not prevent one from catching the rhythm of the verse. Is it not already a first element of ordered complexity, of beauty, when, on hearing a rhyme, that is to say something which is at once similar to and different from the preceding rhyme, which was prompted by it, but introduces the variety of a new idea, one is conscious of two systems overlapping each other, one intellectual, the other prosodie? But Berma at the same time made her words, her lines, her whole speeches even, flow into lakes of sound vaster than themselves, at the margins of which it was a joy to see them obliged to stop, to break off; thus it is that a poet takes pleasure in making hesitate for a moment at the rhyming point the word which is about to spring forth, and a composer in merging the various words of his libretto in a single rhythm which contradicts, captures and controls them. Thus into the prose sentences of the modern playwright as into the poetry of Racine Berma managed to introduce those vast images of grief, nobility, passion, which were the masterpieces of her own personal art, and in which she could be recognised as, in the portraits which he has made of different sitters, we recognise a painter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had no longer any desire, as on the former occasion, to be able to arrest and perpetuate Berma\u2019s attitudes, the fine colour effect which she gave for a moment only in a beam of limelight which at once faded never to reappear, nor to make her repeat a single line a hundred times over. I realised that my original desire had been more exacting than the intentions of the poet, the actress, the great decorative artist who supervised her productions, and that that charm which floated over a line as it was spoken, those unstable poses perpetually transformed into others, those successive pictures were the transient result, the momentary object, the changing masterpiece which the art of the theatre undertook to create and which would perish were an attempt made to fix it for all time by a too much enraptured listener. I did not even make a resolution to come back another day and hear Berma again. I was satisfied with her; it was when I admired too keenly not to be disappointed by the object of my admiration, whether that object were Gilberte or Berma, that I demanded in advance, of the impression to be received on the morrow, the pleasure that yesterday\u2019s impression had refused to afford me. Without seeking to analyse the joy which I had begun now to feel, and might perhaps have been turning to some more profitable use, I said to myself, as in the old days I might have said to one of my schoolfellows: \u201cCertainly, I put Berma first!\u201d not without a confused feeling that Berma\u2019s genius was not, perhaps, very accurately represented by this affirmation of my preference, or this award to her of a \u2018first\u2019 place, whatever the peace of mind that it might incidentally restore to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as the curtain was rising on this second play I looked up at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s box. The Princess was in the act \u2014 by a movement that called into being an exquisite line which my mind pursued into the void \u2014 of turning her head towards the back of the box; her party were all standing, and also turning towards the back, and between the double hedge which they thus formed, with all the assurance, the grandeur of the goddess that she was, but with a strange meekness which so late an arrival, making every one else get up in the middle of the performance, blended with the white muslin in which she was attired, just as an adroitly compounded air of simplicity, shyness and confusion tempered her triumphant smile, the Duchesse de Guermantes, who had at that moment entered the box, came towards her cousin, made a profound obeisance to a young man with fair hair who was seated in the front row, and turning again towards the amphibian monsters who were floating in the recesses of the cavern, gave to these demi-gods of the Jockey Club \u2014 who at that moment, and among them all M. de Palancy in particular, were the men whom I should most have liked to be \u2014 the familiar \u2018good evening\u2019 of an old and intimate friend, an allusion to the daily sequence of her relations with them during the last fifteen years. I felt the mystery, but could not solve the riddle of that smiling gaze which she addressed to her friends, in the azure brilliance with which it glowed while she surrendered her hand to one and then to another, a gaze which, could I have broken up its prism, analysed its crystallisation, might perhaps have revealed to me the essential quality of the unknown form of life which became apparent in it at that moment. The Duc de Guermantes followed his wife, the flash of his monocle, the gleam of his teeth, the whiteness of his carnation or of his pleated shirt-front scattering, to make room for their light, the darkness of his eyebrows, lips and coat; with a wave of his outstretched hand which he let drop on to their shoulders, vertically, without moving his head, he commanded the inferior monsters, who were making way for him, to resume their seats, and made a profound bow to the fair young man. One would have said that the Duchess had guessed that her cousin, of whom, it was rumoured, she was inclined to make fun for what she called her \u2018exaggerations\u2019 (a name which, from her own point of view, so typically French and restrained, would naturally be applied to the poetry and enthusiasm of the Teuton), would be wearing this evening one of those costumes in which the Duchess thought of her as \u2018dressed up,\u2019 and that she had decided to give her a lesson in good taste. Instead of the wonderful downy plumage which, from the crown of the Princess\u2019s head, fell and swept her throat, instead of her net of shells and pearls, the Duchess wore in her hair only a simple aigrette, which, rising above her arched nose and level eyes, reminded one of the crest on the head of a bird. Her neck and shoulders emerged from a drift of snow-white muslin, against which fluttered a swansdown fan, but below this her gown, the bodice of which had for its sole ornament innumerable spangles (either little sticks and beads of metal, or possibly brilliants), moulded her figure with a precision that was positively British. But different as their two costumes were, after the Princess had given her cousin the chair in which she herself had previously been sitting, they could be seen turning to gaze at one another in mutual appreciation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Possibly a smile would curve the lips of Mme. de Guermantes when next day she referred to the headdress, a little too complicated, which the Princess had worn, but certainly she would declare that it had been, all the same, quite lovely, and marvellously arranged; and the Princess, whose own tastes found something a little cold, a little austere, a little \u2018tailor-made\u2019 in her cousin\u2019s way of dressing, would discover in this rigid sobriety an exquisite refinement. Moreover the harmony that existed between them, the universal and pre-established gravitation exercised by their upbringing, neutralised the contrasts not only in their apparel but in their attitude. By those invisible magnetic longitudes which the refinement of their manners traced between them the expansive nature of the Princess was stopped short, while on the other side the formal correctness of the Duchess allowed itself to be attracted and relaxed, turned to sweetness and charm. As, in the play which was now being performed, to realise how much personal poetry Berma extracted from it one had only to entrust the part which she was playing, which she alone could play, to no matter what other actress, so the spectator who should raise his eyes to the balcony might see in two smaller boxes there how an \u2018arrangement\u2019 supposed to suggest that of the Princesse de Guermantes simply made the Baronne de Morienval appear eccentric, pretentious and ill-bred, while an effort, as painstaking as it must have been costly, to imitate the clothes and style of the Duchesse de Guermantes only made Mme. de Cambremer look like some provincial schoolgirl, mounted on wires, rigid, erect, dry, angular, with a plume of raven\u2019s feathers stuck vertically in her hair. Perhaps the proper place for this lady was not a theatre in which it was only with the brightest stars of the season that the boxes (even those in the highest tier, which from below seemed like great hampers brimming with human flowers and fastened to the gallery on which they stood by the red cords of their plush-covered partitions) composed a panorama which deaths, scandals, illnesses, quarrels would soon alter, but which this evening was held motionless by attention, heat, giddiness, dust, smartness or boredom, in that so to speak everlasting moment of unconscious waiting and calm torpor which, in retrospect, seems always to have preceded the explosion of a bomb or the first flicker of a fire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The explanation of Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s presence on this occasion was that the Princesse de Parme, devoid of snobbishness as are most truly royal personages, and to make up for this devoured by a pride in and passion for charity which held an equal place in her heart with her taste for what she believed to be the Arts, had bestowed a few boxes here and there upon women like Mme. de Cambremer who were not numbered among the highest aristocratic society but with whom she was connected in various charitable undertakings. Mme. de Cambremer never took her eyes off the Duchesse and Princesse de Guermantes, which was all the simpler for her since, not being actually acquainted with either, she could not be suspected of angling for recognition. Inclusion in the visiting lists of these two great ladies was nevertheless the goal towards which she had been marching for the last ten years with untiring patience. She had calculated that she might reach it, possibly, in five years more. But having been smitten by a relentless malady, the inexorable character of which \u2014 for she prided herself upon her medical knowledge \u2014 she thought she knew, she was afraid that she might not live so long. This evening she was happy at least in the thought that all these women whom she barely knew would see in her company a man who was one of their own set, the young Marquis de Beausergent, Mme. d\u2019Argencourt\u2019s brother, who moved impartially in both worlds and with whom the women of the second were greatly delighted to bedizen themselves before the eyes of those of the first. He was seated behind Mme. de Cambremer on a chair placed at an angle, so that he might rake the other boxes with his glasses. He knew everyone in the house, and, to greet his friends, with the irresistible charm of his beautifully curved figure, and fine fair head, he half rose from his seat, stiffening his body, a smile brightening his blue eyes, with a blend of deference and detachment, a picture delicately engraved, in its rectangular frame, and placed at an angle to the wall, like one of those old prints which portray a great nobleman in his courtly pride. He often accepted these invitations to go with Mme. de Cambremer to the play. In the theatre itself, and on their way out, in the lobby, he stood gallantly by her side in the thick of the throng of more brilliant friends whom he saw about him, and to whom he refrained from speaking, to avoid any awkwardness, just as though he had been in doubtful company. If at such moments there swept by him the Princesse de Guermantes, lightfoot and fair as Diana, letting trail behind her the folds of an incomparable cloak, turning after her every head and followed by every eye (and, most of all, by Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s), M. de Beausergent would become absorbed in conversation with his companion, acknowledging the friendly and dazzling smile of the Princess only with constraint, under compulsion, and with the well-bred reserve, the considerate coldness of a person whose friendliness might at the moment have been inconvenient\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had not Mme. de Cambremer known already that the box belonged to the Princess, she could still have told that the Duchesse de Guermantes was the guest from the air of keener interest with which she was surveying the spectacle of stage and stalls, out of politeness to her hostess. But simultaneously with this centrifugal force, an equal and opposite force generated by the same desire to be sociable drew her attention back to her own attire, her plume, her necklace, her bodice and also to that of the Princess, whose subject, whose slave her cousin seemed thus to proclaim herself, come thither solely to see her, ready to follow her elsewhere should it have taken the fancy of the official occupant of the box to rise and leave, and regarding as composed merely of strangers, worth looking at simply as curiosities, the rest of the house, in which, nevertheless, she numbered many friends to whose boxes she regularly repaired on other evenings and with regard to whom she never failed on those occasions to demonstrate a similar loyalism, exclusive, conditional and hebdomadary. Mme. de Cambremer was surprised to see her there that evening. She knew that the Duchess was staying on very late at Guermantes, and had supposed her to be there still. But she had been told, also, that sometimes, when there was some special function in Paris which she considered it worth her while to attend, Mme. de Guermantes would order one of her carriages to be brought round as soon as she had taken tea with the guns, and, as the sun was setting, start out at a spanking pace through the gathering darkness of the forest, then over the high road, to join the train at Combray and so be in Paris the same evening. \u201cPerhaps she has come up from Guermantes on purpose to hear Berma,\u201d thought Mme. de Cambremer, and marvelled at the thought. And she remembered having heard Swann say in that ambiguous jargon which he used in common with M. de Charlus: \u201cThe Duchess is one of the noblest souls in Paris, the cream of the most refined, the choicest society.\u201d For myself, who derived from the names Guermantes, Bavaria and Cond\u00e9 what I imagined to be the life, the thoughts of the two cousins (I could no longer so ascribe their faces, having seen them), I would rather have had their opinion of Ph\u00e8dre than that of the greatest critic in the world. For in his I should have found merely intellect, an intellect superior to my own but similar in kind. But what the Duchesse and Princesse de Guermantes might think, an opinion which would have furnished me with an invaluable clue to the nature of these two poetic creatures, I imagined with the aid of their names, I endowed with an irrational charm, and, with the thirst, the longing of a fever-stricken wretch, what I demanded that their opinion of Ph\u00e8dre should yield to me was the charm of the summer afternoons that I had spent in wandering along the Guermantes way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Cambremer was trying to make out how exactly the cousins were dressed. For my own part, I never doubted that their garments were peculiar to themselves, not merely in the sense in which the livery with red collar or blue facings had belonged once exclusively to the houses of Guermantes and Cond\u00e9, but rather as is peculiar to a bird the plumage which, as well as being a heightening of its beauty, is an extension of its body. The toilet of these two ladies seemed to me like a materialisation, snow-white or patterned with colour, of their internal activity, and, like the gestures which I had seen the Princesse de Guermantes make, with no doubt in my own mind that they corresponded to some idea latent in hers, the plumes which swept downward from her brow, and her cousin\u2019s glittering spangled bodice seemed each to have a special meaning, to be to one or the other lady an attribute which was hers and hers alone, the significance of which I would eagerly have learned; the bird of paradise seemed inseparable from its wearer as her peacock is from Juno, and I did not believe that any other woman could usurp that spangled bodice, any more than the fringed and flashing aegis of Minerva. And when I turned my eyes to their box, far more than on the ceiling of the theatre, painted with cold and lifeless allegories, it was as though I had seen, thanks to a miraculous rending of the clouds that ordinarily veiled it, the Assembly of the Gods in the act of contemplating the spectacle of mankind, beneath a crimsor canopy, in a clear lighted space, between two pillars of Heaven. I gazed on this brief transfiguration with a disturbance which was partly soothed by the feeling that I myself was unknown to these Immortals; the Duchess had indeed seen me once with her husband, but could surely have kept no memory of that, and it gave me no pain that she found herself, owing to the place that she occupied in the box, in a position to gaze down upon the nameless, collective madrepores of the public in the stalls, for I had the happy sense that my own personality had been dissolved in theirs, when, at the moment in which, by the force of certain optical laws, there must, I suppose, have come to paint itself on the impassive current of those blue eyes the blurred outline of the protozoon, devoid of any individual existence, which was myself, I saw a ray illumine them; the Duchess, goddess turned woman, and appearing in that moment a thousand times more lovely, raised, pointed in my direction the white-gloved hand which had been resting on the balustrade of the box, waved it at me in token of friendship; my gaze felt itself trapped in the spontaneous incandescence of the flashing eyes of the Princess, who had unconsciously set them ablaze merely by turning her head to see who it might be that her cousin was thus greeting, while the Duchess, who had remembered me, showered upon me the sparkling and celestial torrent of her smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now every morning, long before the hour at which she would appear, I went by a devious course to post myself at the corner of the street along which she generally came, and, when the moment of her arrival seemed imminent, strolled homewards with an air of being absorbed in something else, looking the other way and raising my eyes to her face as I drew level with her, but as though I had not in the least expected to see her. Indeed, for the first few mornings, so as to be sure of not missing her, I waited opposite the house. And every time that the carriage gate opened (letting out one after another so many people who were none of them she for whom I was waiting) its grinding rattle continued in my heart in a series of oscillations which it took me a long time to subdue. For never was devotee of a famous actress whom he did not know, posting himself and patrolling the pavement outside the stage door, never was angry or idolatrous crowd, gathered to insult or to carry in triumph through the streets the condemned assassin or the national hero whom it believes to be on the point of coming whenever a sound is heard from the inside of the prison or the palace, never were these so stirred by their emotion as I was, awaiting the emergence of this great lady who in her simple attire was able, by the grace of her movements (quite different from the gait she affected on entering a drawing-room or a box), to make of her morning walk \u2014 and for me there was no one in the world but herself out walking \u2014 a whole poem of elegant refinement and the finest ornament, the most curious flower of the season. But after the third day, so that the porter should not discover my stratagem, I betook myself much farther afield, to some point upon the Duchess\u2019s usual route. Often before that evening at the theatre I had made similar little excursions before luncheon when the weather was fine; if it had been raining, at the first gleam of sunshine I would hasten downstairs to take a turn, and if, suddenly, coming towards me, on the still wet pavement changed by the sun into a golden lacquer, in the transformation scene of a crossroads dusty with a grey mist which the sun tanned and gilded, I caught sight of a schoolgirl followed by her governess or of a dairy-maid with her white sleeves, I stood motionless, my hand pressed to my heart which was already leaping towards an unexplored form of life; I tried to bear in mind the street, the time, the number of the door through which the girl (whom I followed sometimes) had vanished and failed to reappear. Fortunately the fleeting nature of these cherished images, which I promised myself that I would make an effort to see again, prevented them from fixing themselves with any vividness in my memory. No matter, I was less sad now at the thought of my own ill health, of my never having summoned up courage to set to work, to begin a book, the world appeared to me now a pleasanter place to live in, life a more interesting experience now that I had learned that the streets of Paris, like the roads round Balbec, were aflower with those unknown beauties whom I had so often sought to evoke from the woods of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, each one of whom aroused a sensual longing which she alone appeared capable of assuaging\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On coming home from the Op\u00e9ra-Comique I had added for next morning to the list of those which for some days past I had been hoping to meet again the form of Mme. de Guermantes, tall, with her high-piled crown of silky, golden hair; with the kindness promised me in the smile which she had directed at me from her cousin\u2019s box. I would follow the course which Fran\u00e7oise had told me that the Duchess generally took, and I would try at the same time, in the hope of meeting two girls whom I had seen a few days earlier, not to miss the break-up of their respective class and catechism. But in the mean time, ever and again, the scintillating smile of Mme. de Guermantes, the pleasant sensation it had given me, returned. And without exactly knowing what I was doing, I tried to find a place for them (as a woman studies the possible effect on her dress of some set of jewelled buttons that have just been given her) beside the romantic ideas which I had long held and which Albertine\u2019s coldness, Gis\u00e8le\u2019s premature departure, ana before them my deliberate and too long sustained separation from Gilberte, had set free (the idea, for instance of being loved by a woman, of having a life in common with her); next, it had been the image of one or other of the two girls seen in the street that I brought into relation with those ideas, to which immediately afterwards I was trying to adapt my memory of the Duchess. Compared with those ideas my memory of Mme. de Guermantes at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique was a very little thing, a tiny star twinkling beside the long tail of a blazing comet; moreover I had been quite familiar with the ideas long before I came to know Mme. de Guermantes; my memory of her, on the contrary, I possessed but imperfectly; every now and then it escaped me; it was during the hours when, from floating vaguely in my mind in the same way as the images of various other pretty women, it passed gradually into a unique and definite association \u2014 exclusive of every other feminine form \u2014 with those romantic ideas of so much longer standing than itself, it was during those few hours in which I remembered it most clearly that I ought to have taken steps to find out exactly what it was; but I did not then know the importance which it was to assume for me; it was pleasant merely as a first private meeting with Mme. de Guermantes inside myself, it was the first, the only accurate sketch, the only one taken from life, the only one that was really Mme. de Guermantes; during the few hours in which I was fortunate enough to retain it without having the sense to pay it any attention, it must all the same have been charming, that memory, since it was always to it, and quite freely moreover, to that moment, without haste, without strain, without the slightest compulsion or anxiety, that my ideas of love returned; then, as gradually those ideas fixed it more definitely, it acquired from them a proportionately greater strength but itself became more vague; presently I could no longer recapture it; and in my dreams I probably altered it completely, for whenever I saw Mme. de Guermantes I realised the difference \u2014 never twice, as it happened, the same \u2014 between what I had imagined and what I saw. And now every morning, certainly at the moment when Mme. de Guermantes emerged from her gateway at the top of the street I saw again her tall figure, her face with its bright eyes and crown of silken hair \u2014 all the things for which I was there waiting; but, on the other hand, a minute or two later, when, having first turned my eyes away so as to appear not to be waiting for this encounter which I had come out to seek, I raised them to look at the Duchess at the moment in which we converged, what I saw then were red patches (as to which I knew not whether they were due to the fresh air or to a faulty complexion) on a sullen face which with the curtest of nods, a long way removed from the affability of the Ph\u00e8dre evening, acknowledged my salute, which I addressed to her daily with an air of surprise, and which did not seem to please her. And yet, after a few days, during which the memory of the two girls fought against heavy odds for the mastery of my amorous feelings against that of Mme. de Guermantes, it was in the end the latter which, as though of its own accord, generally prevailed while its competitors withdrew; it was to it that I finally found myself, deliberately moreover, and as though by preference and for my own pleasure, to have transferred all my thoughts of love. I had ceased to dream of the little girls coming from their catechism, or of a certain dairy-maid; and yet I had also lost all hope of encountering in the street what I had come out to seek, either the affection promised to me, at the theatre, in a smile, or the profile, the bright face beneath its pile of golden hair which were so only when seen from afar. Now I should not even have been able to say what Mme. de Guermantes was like, by what I recognised her, for every day, in the picture which she presented as a whole, the face was different, as were the dress and the hat\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why did I one morning, when I saw bearing down on me beneath a violet hood a sweet, smooth face whose charms were symmetrically arranged about a pair of blue eyes, a face in which the curve of the nose seemed to have been absorbed, gauge from a joyous commotion in my bosom that I was not going to return home without having caught a glimpse of Mme. de Guermantes; and on the next feel the same disturbance, affect the same indifference, turn away my eyes in the same careless manner as on the day before, on the apparition, seen in profile as she crossed from a side street and crowned by a navy-blue toque, of a beak-like nose bounding a flushed cheek chequered with a piercing eye, like some Egyptian deity? Once it was not merely a woman with a bird\u2019s beak that I saw but almost the bird itself; the outer garments, even the toque of Mme. de Guermantes were of fur, and since she thus left no cloth visible, she seemed naturally furred, like certain vultures whose thick, smooth, dusky, downy plumage suggests rather the skin of a wild beast. From the midst of this natural plumage, the tiny head arched out its beak and the two eyes on its surface were piercing-keen and blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day I had been pacing up and down the street for hours on end without a vestige of Mme. de Guermantes when suddenly, inside a pastrycook\u2019s shop tucked in between two of the mansions of this aristocratic and plebeian quarter, there appeared, took shape the vague and unfamiliar face of a fashionably dressed woman who was asking to see some little cakes, and, before I had had time to make her out, there shot forth at me like a lightning flash, reaching me sooner than its accompaniment of thunder, the glance of the Duchess; another time, having failed to meet her and hearing twelve strike, I realised that it was not worth my while to wait for her any longer, I Was sorrowfully making my way homewards; and, absorbed in my own disappointment, looking absently after and not seeing a carriage that had overtaken me, I realised suddenly that the movement of her head which I saw a lady make through the carriage window was meant for me, and that this lady, whose features, relaxed and pale, or it might equally be tense and vivid, composed, beneath a round hat which nestled at the foot of a towering plume, the face of a stranger whom I had supposed that I did not know, was Mme. de Guermantes, by whom I had let myself be greeted without so much as acknowledging her bow. And sometimes I came upon her as I entered the gate, standing outside the lodge where the detestable porter whose scrutinous eye I loathed and dreaded was in the act of making her a profound obeisance and also, no doubt, his daily report. For the entire staff of the Guermantes household, hidden behind the window curtains, were trembling as they watched a conversation which they were unable to overhear, but which meant as they very well knew that one or other of them would certainly have his \u2018day out\u2019 stopped by the Duchess to whom this Cerberus was betraying him. In view of the whole series of different faces which Mme. Guermantes displayed thus one after another, faces that occupied a relative and varying extent, contracted one day, vast the next, in her person and attire as a whole, my love was not attached to any one of those changeable and ever-changing elements of flesh and fabric which replaced one another as day followed day, and which she could modify, could almost entirely reconstruct without altering my disturbance because beneath them, beneath the new collar and the strange cheek, I felt that it was still Mme. de Guermantes. What I loved was the invisible person who set all this outward show in motion, her whose hostility so distressed me, whose approach set me trembling, whose life I would fain have made my own and driven out of it her friends. She might flaunt a blue feather or shew a fiery cheek without her actions\u2019 losing their importance for me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should not myself have felt that Mme. de Guermantes was tired of meeting me day after day, had I not learned it indirectly by reading it on the face, stiff with coldness, disapproval and pity which Fran\u00e7oise shewed when she was helping me to get ready for these morning walks. The moment I asked her for my outdoor things I felt a contrary wind arise in her worn and battered features. I made no attempt to win her confidence, for I knew that I should not succeed. She had, for at once discovering any unpleasant thing that might have happened to my parents or myself, a power the nature of which I have never been able to fathom. Perhaps it was not supernatural, but was to be explained by sourees of information that were open to her alone: as it may happen that the news which often reaches a savage tribe several days before the post has brought it to the European colony has really been transmitted to them not by telepathy but from hill-top to hill-top by a chain of beacon fires. So, in the particular instance of my morning walks, possibly Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s servants had heard their mistress say how tired she was of running into me every day without fail wherever she went, and had repeated her remarks to Fran\u00e7oise. My parents might, it is true, have attached some servant other than Fran\u00e7oise to my person, still I should have been no better off. Fran\u00e7oise was in a sense less of a servant than the others. In her way of feeling things, of being kind and pitiful, hard and distant, superior and narrow, of combining a white skin with red hands, she was still the village maiden whose parents had had \u2018a place of their own\u2019 but having come to grief had been obliged to put her into service. Her presence in our household was the country air, the social life of a farm of fifty years ago wafted to us by a sort of reversal of the normal order of travel whereby it is the place that comes to visit the person. As the glass cases in a local museum are filled with specimens of the curious handiwork which the peasants still carve or embroider or whatever it may be in certain parts of the country, so our flat in Paris was decorated with the words of Fran\u00e7oise, inspired by a traditional local sentiment and governed by extremely ancient laws. And she could in Paris find her way back as though by clues of coloured thread to the songbirds and cherry trees of her childhood, to her mother\u2019s deathbed, which she still vividly saw. But in spite of all this wealth of background, once she had come to Paris and had entered our service she had acquired \u2014 as, obviously, anyone else coming there in her place would have acquired \u2014 the ideas, the system of interpretation used by the servants on the other floors, compensating for the respect which she was obliged to shew to us by repeating the rude words that the cook on the fourth floor had used to her mistress, with a servile gratification so intense that, for the first time in our lives, feeling a sort of solidarity between ourselves and the detestable occupant of the fourth floor flat, we said to ourselves that possibly we too were \u2018employers\u2019 after all. This alteration in Fran\u00e7oise\u2019\u00bb character was perhaps inevitable. Certain forms of existence are so abnormal that they are bound to produce certain characteristic faults; such was the life led by the King at Versailles among his courtiers, a life as strange as that of a Pharaoh or a Doge \u2014 and, far more even than his, the life of his courtiers. The life led by our servants is probably of an even more monstrous abnormality, which only its familiarity can prevent us from seeing. But it was actually in details more intimate still that I should have been obliged, if I had dismissed Fran\u00e7oise, to keep the same servant. For various others might, in years to come, enter my service; already furnished with the defects common to all servants, they underwent nevertheless a rapid transformation with me. As, in the rules of tactics, an attack in one sector compels a counter-attack in another, so as not to be hurt by the asperities of my nature, all of them effected in their own an identical resilience, always at the same points, and to make up for this took advantage of the gaps in my line to thrust out advanced posts. Of these gaps I knew nothing, any more than of the salients to which they gave rise, precisely because they were gaps. But my servants, by gradually becoming spoiled, taught me of their existence. It was from the defects which they invariably acquired that I learned what were my own natural and invariable shortcomings; their character offered me a sort of negative plate of my own. We had always laughed, my mother and I, at Mme. Sazerat, who used, in speaking of her servants, expressions like \u2018the lower orders\u2019 or \u2018the servant class.\u2019 But I am bound to admit that what made it useless to think of replacing Fran\u00e7oise by anyone else was that her successor would inevitably have belonged just as much to the race of servants in general and to the class of my servants in particular\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to Fran\u00e7oise, I never in my life experienced any humiliation without having seen beforehand on her face a store of condolences prepared and waiting; and if then in my anger at the thought of being pitied by her I tried to pretend that on the contrary I had scored a distinct success, my lies broke feebly on the wall of her respectful but obvious unbelief and the consciousness that she enjoyed of her own infallibility. For she knew the truth. She refrained from uttering it, and made only a slight movement with her lips as if she still bad her mouth full and was finishing a tasty morsel. She refrained from uttering it, or so at least I long believed, for at that time I still supposed that it was by means of words that one communicated the truth to others. Indeed the words that people used to me recorded their meaning so unalterably on the sensitive plate of my mind that I could no more believe it to be possible that anyone who had professed to love me did not love me than Fran\u00e7oise herself could have doubted when she had read it in a newspaper that some clergyman or gentleman was prepared, on receipt of a stamped envelope, to furnish us free of charge with an infallible remedy for every known complaint or with the means of multiplying our income an hundredfold. (If, on the other hand, our doctor were to prescribe for her the simplest ointment to cure a cold in the head, she, so stubborn to endure the keenest suffering, would complain bitterly of what she had been made to sniff, insisting that it tickled her nose and that life was not worth living.) But she was the first person to prove to me by her example (which I was not to understand until, long afterwards, when it was given me afresh and to my greater discomfort, as will be found in the later volumes of this work, by a person who was dearer to me than Fran\u00e7oise) that the truth has no need to be uttered to be made apparent, and that one may perhaps gather it with more certainty, without waiting for words, without even bothering one\u2019s head about them, from a thousand outward signs, even from certain invisible phenomena, analogous in the sphere of human character to what in nature are atmospheric changes. I might perhaps have suspected this. since to myself at that time it frequently occurred that I said things in which there was no vestige of truth, while I made the real truth plain by all manner of involuntary confidences expressed by my body and in my actions (which were at once interpreted by Fran\u00e7oise); I ought perhaps to have suspected it, but to do so I should first have had to be conscious that I myself was occasionally untruthful and dishonest. Now untruthfulness and dishonesty were with me, as with most people; called into being in so immediate, so contingent a fashion, and in self-defence, by some particular interest, that my mind, fixed on some lofty ideal, allowed my character, in the darkness below, to set about those urgent, sordid tasks, and did net look down to observe them. When Fran\u00e7oise, in the evening, was polite to me, and asked my permission before sitting down in my room, it seemed as though her face became transparent and I could see the goodness and honesty that lay beneath. But Jupien, who had lapses into indiscretion of which I learned only later, revealed afterwards that she had told him that I was not worth the price of a rope to hang me, and that I had tried to insult her in every possible way. These words of Jupien set up at once before my eyes, in new and strange colours, a print of the picture of my relations with Fran\u00e7oise so different from that on which I used to like letting my eyes rest, and in which, without the least possibility of doubt, Fran\u00e7oise adored me and lost no opportunity of singing my praises, that I realised that it is not only the material world that is different from the aspect in which we see it; that all reality is perhaps equally dissimilar from what we think ourselves to be directly perceiving; that the trees, the sun and the sky would not be the same as what we see if they were apprehended by creatures having eyes differently constituted from ours, or, better still, endowed for that purpose with organs other than eyes which would furnish trees and sky and sun with equivalents, though not visual. However that might be, this sudden outlet which Jupien threw open for me upon the real world appalled me. So far it was only Fran\u00e7oise that was revealed, and of her I barely thought. Was it the same with all one\u2019s social relations? And in what depths of despair might this not some day plunge me, if it were the same with love? That was the future\u2019s secret. For the present only Fran\u00e7oise was concerned. Did she sincerely believe what she had said to Jupien? Had she said it to embroil Jupien with me, possibly so that we should not appoint Jupien\u2019s girl as her successor? At any rate I realised the impossibility of obtaining any direct and certain knowledge of whether Fran\u00e7oise loved or lothed me. And thus it was she who first gave me the idea that a person does not (as I had imagined) stand motionless and clear before our eyes with his merits, his defects, his plans, his intentions with regard to ourself exposed on his surface, like a garden at which, with all its borders spread out before us, we gaze through a railing, but is a shadow which we can never succeed in penetrating, of which there can be no such thing as direct knowledge, with respect to which we form countless beliefs, based upon his words and sometimes upon his actions, though neither words nor actions can give us anything but inadequate and as it proves contradictory information \u2014 a shadow behind which we can alternately imagine, with equal justification, that there burns the flame of hatred and of love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was genuinely in love with Mme. de Guermantes. The greatest happiness that I could have asked of God would have been that He should overwhelm her under every imaginable calamity, and that ruined, despised, stripped of all the privileges that divided her from me, having no longer any home of her own or people who would condescend to speak to her, she should come to me for refuge. I imagined her doing so. And indeed on those evenings when some change in the atmosphere or in my own condition brought to the surface of my consciousness some forgotten scroll on which were recorded impressions of other days, instead of profiting by the refreshing strength that had been generated in me, instead of employing it to decipher in my own mind thoughts which as a rule escaped me, instead of setting myself at last to work, I preferred to relate aloud, to plan out in the third person, with a flow of invention as useless as was my declamation of it, a whole novel crammed with adventure, in which the Duchess, fallen upon misfortune, came to implore assistance from me \u2014 me who had become, by a converse change of circumstances, rich and powerful. And when I had let myself thus for hours on end imagine the circumstances, rehearse the sentences with which I should welcome the Duchess beneath my roof, the situation remained unaltered; I had, alas, in reality, chosen to love the very woman who, in her own person, combined perhaps the greatest possible number of different advantages; in whose eyes, accordingly, I could not hope, myself, ever to cut any figure; for she was as rich as the richest commoner \u2014 and noble also; without reckoning that personal charm which set her at the pinnacle of fashion, made her among the rest a sort of queen\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt that I was annoying her by crossing her path in this way every morning; but even if I had had the courage to refrain, for two or three days consecutively, from doing so, perhaps that abstention, which would have represented so great a sacrifice on my part, Mme. de Guermantes would not have noticed, or would have set it down to some obstacle beyond my control. And indeed I could not have succeeded in making myself cease to track her down except by arranging that it should be impossible for me to do so, for the need incessantly reviving in me to meet her, to be for a moment the object of her attention, the person to whom her bow was addressed, was stronger than my fear of arousing her displeasure. I should have had to go away for some time; and for that I had not the heart. I did think of it more than once. I would then tell Fran\u00e7oise to pack my boxes, and immediately afterwards to unpack them. And as the spirit of imitation, the desire not to appear behind the times, alters the most natural and most positive form of oneself, Fran\u00e7oise, borrowing the expression from her daughter\u2019s vocabulary, used to remark that I was \u2018dippy.\u2019 She did not approve of this; she said that I was always \u2018balancing,\u2019 for she made use, when she was not aspiring to rival the moderns, of the language of Saint-Simon. It is true that she liked it still less when I spoke to her as master to servant. She knew that this was not natural to me, and did not suit me, a condition which she rendered in words as \u2018where there isn\u2019t a will.\u2019 I should never have had the heart to leave Paris except in a direction that would bring me closer to Mme. de Guermantes. This was by no means an impossibility. Should I not indeed find myself nearer to her than I was in the morning, in the street, solitary, abashed, feeling that not a single one of the thoughts which I should have liked to convey to her ever reached her, in that weary patrolling up and down of walks which might be continued, day after day, for ever without the slightest advantage to myself, if I were to go miles away from Mme. de Guermantes, but go to some one of her acquaintance, some one whom she knew to be particular in the choice of his friends and who would appreciate my good qualities, would be able to speak to her about me, and if not to obtain it from her at least to make her know what I wanted, some one by means of whom, in any event, simply because I should discuss with him whether or not it would be possible for him to convey this or that message to her, I should give to my solitary and silent meditations a new form, spoken, active, which would seem an advance, almost a realisation. What she did during the mysterious daily life of the \u2018Guermantes\u2019 that she was \u2014 this was the constant object of my thoughts; and to break through the mystery, even by indirect means, as with a lever, by employing the services of a person to whom were not forbidden the town house of the Duchess, her parties, unrestricted conversation with her, would not that be a contact more distant but at the same time more effective than my contemplation of her every morning in the street?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The friendship, the admiration that Saint-Loup felt for me seemed to me undeserved and had hitherto left me unmoved. All at once I attached a value to them, I would have liked him to disclose them to Mme. de Guermantes, I was quite prepared even to ask him to do so. For when we are in love, all the trifling little privileges that we enjoy we would like to be able to divulge to the woman we love, as people who have been disinherited and bores of other kinds do to us in everyday life. We are distressed by her ignorance of them; we seek consolation in the thought that just because they are never visible she has perhaps added to the opinion which she already had of us this possibility of further advantages that must remain unknown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup had not for a long time been able to come to Paris, whether, as he himself explained, on account of his military duties, or, as was more likely, on account of the trouble that he was having with his mistress, with whom he had twice now been on the point of breaking off relations. He had often told me what a pleasure it would be to him if I came to visit him at that garrison town, the name of which, a couple of days after his leaving Balbec, had caused me so much joy when I had read it on the envelope of the first letter I received from my friend. It was (not so far from Balbec as its wholly inland surroundings might have led one to think) one of those little fortified towns, aristocratic and military, set in a broad expanse of country over which on fine days there floats so often into the distance a sort of intermittent haze of sound which \u2014 as a screen of poplars by its sinuosities outlines the course of a river which one cannot see \u2014 indicates the movements of a regiment on parade, so that the very atmosphere of its streets, avenues and squares has been gradually tuned to a sort of perpetual vibration, musical and martial, while the most ordinary note of cartwheel or tramway is prolonged in vague trumpet calls, indefinitely repeated, to the hallucinated ear, by the silence. It was not too far away from Paris for me to be able, if I took the express, to return, join my mother and grandmother and sleep in my own bed. As soon as I realised this, troubled by a painful longing, I had too little will power to decide not to return to Paris but rather to stay in this town; but also too little to prevent a porter from carrying my luggage to a cab and not to adopt, as I walked behind him, the unburdened mind of a traveller who is looking after his luggage and for whom no grandmother is waiting anywhere at home, to get into the carriage with the complete detachment of a person who, having ceased to think of what it is that he wants, has the air of knowing what he wants, and to give the driver the address of the cavalry barracks. I thought that Saint-Loup might come to sleep that night at the hotel at which I should be staying, so as to make less painful for me the first shock of contact with this strange town. One of the guard went to find him, and I waited at the barrack gate, before that huge ship of stone, booming with the November wind, out of which, every moment, for it was now six o\u2019clock, men were emerging in pairs into the street, staggering as if they were coming ashore in some foreign port in which they found themselves temporarily anchored\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup appeared, moving like a whirlwind, his eyeglass spinning in the air before him; I had not given my name, I was eager to enjoy his surprise and delight. \u201cOh! What a bore!\u201d he exclaimed, suddenly catching sight of me, and blushing to the tips of his ears. \u201cI have just had a week\u2019s leave, and I shan\u2019t be off duty again for another week.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, preoccupied by the thought of my having to spend this first night alone, for he knew better than anyone my bed-time agonies, which he had often remarked and soothed at Balbec, he broke off his lamentation to turn and look at me, coax me with little smiles, with tender though unsymmetrical glances, half of them coming directly from his eye, the other half through his eyeglass, but both sorts alike an allusion to the emotion that he felt on seeing me again, an allusion also to that important matter which I did not always understand but which concerned me now vitally, our friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say! Where are you going to sleep? Really, I can\u2019t recommend the hotel where we mess; it is next to the Exhibition ground, where there\u2019s a show just starting; you\u2019ll find it beastly crowded. No, you\u2019d better go to the H\u00f4tel de Flandre; it is a little eighteenth-century palace with old tapestries. It \u2018makes\u2019 quite an \u2018old-world residence.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup employed in every connexion the word \u2018makes\u2019 for \u2018has the air of,\u2019 because the spoken language, like the written, feels from time to time the need of these alterations in the meanings of words, these refinements of expression. And just as journalists often have not the least idea from what school of literature come the \u2018turns of speech\u2019 that they borrow, so the vocabulary, the very diction of Saint-Loup were formed in imitation of three different aesthetes, none of whom he knew personally but whose way of speaking had been indirectly instilled into him. \u201cBesides,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthe hotel I mean is more or less adapted to your supersensitiveness of hearing. You will have no neighbours. I quite see that it is a slender advantage, and as, after all, another visitor may arrive to-morrow, it would not be worth your while to choose that particular hotel with so precarious an object in view. No, it is for its appeal to the eye that I recommend it. The rooms are quite attractive, all the furniture is old and comfortable; there is something reassuring about that.\u201d But to me, less of an artist than Saint-Loup, the pleasure that an attractive house could give was superficial, almost non-existent, and could not calm my growing anguish, as painful as that which I used to feel long ago at Combray when my mother did not come upstairs to say good night, or that which I felt on the evening of my arrival at Balbec in the room with the unnaturally high ceiling, which smelt of flowering grasses. Saint-Loup read all this in my fixed gaze\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA lot you care, though, about this charming palace, my poor fellow; you\u2019re quite pale; and here am I like a great brute talking to you about tapestries which you won\u2019t have the heart to look at, even. I know the room they\u2019ll put you in; personally I find it most enlivening, but I can quite understand that it won\u2019t have the same effect on you with your sensitive nature. You mustn\u2019t think I don\u2019t understand; I don\u2019t feel the same myself, but I can put myself in your place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment a serjeant who was exercising a horse on the square, entirely absorbed in making the animal jump, disregarding the salutes of passing troopers, but hurling volleys of oaths at such as got in his way, turned with a smile to Saint-Loup and, seeing that he had a friend with him, saluted us. But his horse at once reared. Saint-Loup flung himself at its head, caught it by the bridle, succeeded in quieting it and returned to my side\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d he resumed; \u201cI assure you that I fully understand; I feel for you as keenly as you do yourself. I am wretched,\u201d he went on, laying his hand lovingly on my shoulder, \u201cwhen I think that if I could have stayed with you to-night, I might have been able, if we talked till morning, to relieve you of a little of your unhappiness. I can lend you any number of books, but you won\u2019t want to read if you\u2019re feeling like that. And I shan\u2019t be able to get anyone else to take my duty here; I\u2019ve been off now twice running because my girl came down to see me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he knitted his brows partly with vexation and also in the effort to decide, like a doctor, what remedy he might best apply to my disease\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRun along and light the fire in my quarters,\u201d he called to a trooper who passed us. \u201cHurry up; get a move on!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After which he turned once more to me, and his eyeglass and his peering, myopic gaze hinted an allusion to our great friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo! To see you here, in these barracks where I have spent so much time thinking about you, I can scarcely believe my eyes. I must be dreaming. And how are you? Better, I hope. You must tell me all about yourself presently. We\u2019ll go up to my room; we mustn\u2019t hang about too long on the square, there\u2019s the devil of a draught; I don\u2019t feel it now myself, but you aren\u2019t accustomed to it, I\u2019m afraid of your catching cold. And what about your work; have you started yet? No? You are a quaint fellow! If I had your talent I\u2019m sure I should be writing morning, noon and night. It amuses you more to do nothing? What a pity it is that it\u2019s the useless fellows like me who are always ready to work, and the ones who could if they wanted to, won\u2019t. There, and I\u2019ve clean forgotten to ask you how your grandmother is. Her Proudhons are in safe keeping. I never part from them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An officer, tall, handsome, majestic, emerged with slow and solemn gait from the foot of a staircase. Saint-Loup saluted him and arrested the perpetual instability of his body for the moment occupied in holding his hand against the peak of his cap. But he had flung himself into the action with so much force, straightening himself with so sharp a movement, and, the salute ended, let his hand fall with so abrupt a relaxation, altering all the positions of shoulder, leg, and eyeglass, that this moment was one not so much of immobility as of a throbbing tension in which were neutralised the excessive movements which he had just made and those on which he was about to embark. Meanwhile the officer, without coming any nearer us, calm, benevolent, dignified, imperial, representing, in short, the direct opposite of Saint-Loup, himself also, but without haste, raised his hand to the peak of his cap\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI must just say a word to the Captain,\u201d whispered Saint-Loup. \u201cBe a good fellow, and go and wait for me in my room. It\u2019s the second on the right, on the third floor; I\u2019ll be with you in a minute.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And setting off at the double, preceded by his eyeglass which fluttered in every direction, he made straight for the slow and stately Captain whose horse had just been brought round and who, before preparing to mount, was giving orders with a studied nobility of gesture as in some historical painting, and as though he were setting forth to take part in some battle of the First Empire, whereas he was simply going to ride home, to the house which he had taken for the period of his service at Donci\u00e8res, and which stood in a Square that was named, as though in an ironical anticipation of the arrival of this Napoleonid, Place de la R\u00e9publique. I started to climb the staircase, nearly slipping on each of its nail-studded steps, catching glimpses of barrack-rooms, their bare walls edged with a double line of beds and kits. I was shewn Saint-Loup\u2019s room. I stood for a moment outside its closed door, for I could hear some one stirring; he moved something, let fall something else; I felt that the room was not empty, that there must be somebody there. But it was only the freshly lighted fire beginning to burn. It could not keep quiet, it kept shifting its faggots about, and very clumsily. I entered the room; it let one roll into the fender and set another smoking. And even when it was not moving, like an ill-bred person it made noises all the time, which, from the moment I saw the flames rising, revealed themselves to me as noises made by a fire, although if I had been on the other side of a wall I should have thought that they came from some one who was blowing his nose and walking about. I sat down in the room and waited. Liberty hangings and old German stuffs of the eighteenth century managed to rid it of the smell that was exhaled by the rest of the building, a coarse, insipid, mouldy smell like that of stale toast. It was here, in this banning room, that I could have dined and slept with a calm and happy mind Saint-Loup seemed almost to be present by reason of the text-books which littered his table, between his photographs, among which I could make out my own and that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, by the light of the fire which had at length grown accustomed to the grate, and, like an animal crouching in an ardent, noiseless, faithful watchfulness, let fall only now and then a smouldering log which crumbled into sparks, or licked with a tongue of flame the sides of the chimney. I heard the tick of Saint-Loup\u2019s watch, which could not be far away. This tick changed its place every moment \u2018for I could not see the watch; it seemed to come from behind, from in front of me, from my right, from my left, sometimes to die away as though at a great distance. Suddenly I caught sight of the watch on the table. Then I heard the tick in a fixed place from which it did not move again. That is to say, I thought I heard it at this place; I did not hear it there; I saw it there, for sounds have no position in space. Or rather we associate them with movements, and in that way they serve the purpose of warning us of those movements, of appearing to make them necessary and natural. Certainly it happens commonly enough that a sick man whose ears have been stopped with cotton-wool ceases to hear the noise of a fire such as was crackling at that moment in Saint-Loup\u2019s fireplace, labouring at the formation of brands and cinders, which it then lets fall into the fender, nor would he hear the passage of the tramway-cars whose music took its flight, at regular intervals, over the Grand\u2019place of Donci\u00e8res. Let the sick man then read a book, and the pages will turn silently before him, as though they were moved by the fingers of a god. The dull thunder of a bath which is being filled becomes thin, faint and distant as the twittering of birds in the sky. The withdrawal of sound, its dilution, take from it all its power to hurt us; driven mad a moment ago by hammer-blows which seemed to be shattering the ceiling above our head, it is with a quiet delight that we now gather in their sound, light, caressing, distant, like the murmur of leaves playing by the roadside with the passing breeze. We play games of patience with cards which we do not hear, until we imagine that we have not touched them, that they are moving of their own accord, and, anticipating our desire to play with them, have begun to play with us. And in this connexion we may ask ourselves whether, in the case of love (to which indeed we may add the love of life and the love of fame, since there are, it appears, persons who are acquainted with these latter sentiments), we ought not to act like those who, when a noise disturbs them, instead of praying that it may cease, stop their ears; and, with them for our pattern, bring our attention, our defensive strength to bear on ourselves, give ourselves as an objective to capture not the \u2018other person\u2019 with whom we are in love but our capacity for suffering at that person\u2019s hands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to the problem of sounds, we have only to thicken the wads which close the aural passages, and they confine to a pianissimo the girl who has just been playing a boisterous tune overhead; if we go farther, and steep the wad in grease, at once the whole household must obey its despotic rule; its laws extend even beyond our portals. Pianissimo is not enough; the wad instantly orders the piano to be shut, and the music lesson is abruptly ended; the gentleman who was walking up and down in the room above breaks off in the middle of his beat; the movement of carriages and tramways is interrupted as though a Sovereign were expected to pass. And indeed this attenuation of sounds sometimes disturbs our slumbers instead of guarding them. Only yesterday the incessant noise in our ears, by describing to us in a continuous narrative all that was happening in the street and in the house, succeeded at length in making us sleep, like L boring book; to-night, through the sheet of silence that is spread over our sleep a shock, louder than the rest, manages to make itself heard, gentle as a sigh, unrelated to any other sound, mysterious; and the call for an explanation which it emits is sufficient to awaken us. Take away for a moment from the sick man the cotton-wool that has been stopping his ears and in a flash the full daylight, the sun of sound dawns afresh, dazzling him, is born again in his universe; in all haste returns the multitude of exiled sounds; we are present, as though it were the chanting of choirs of angels, at the resurrection of the voice. The empty streets are filled for a moment with the whirr of the swift, consecutive wings of the singing tramway-cars. In the bedroom itself, the sick man has created, not, like Prometheus, fire, but the sound of fire. And when we increase or reduce the wads of cottonwool, it is as though we were pressing alternately one and the other of the two pedals with which we have extended the resonant compass of the outer world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only there are also suppressions of sound which are not temporary. The man who has grown completely deaf cannot even heat a pan of milk by his bedside, but he must keep an eye open to watch, on the tilted lid, for the white, arctic reflexion, like that of a coming snowstorm, which is the warning sign which he is wise to obey, by cutting off (as Our Lord bade the waves be still) the electric current; for already the swelling, jerkily climbing egg of boiling milk-film is reaching its climax in a series of sidelong movements, has filled and set bellying the drooping sails with which the cream has skimmed its surface, sends in a sudden storm a scud of pearly substance flying overboard \u2014 sails which the cutting off of the current, if the electric storm is hushed in time, will fold back upon themselves and let fall with the ebbing tide, changed now to magnolia petals. But if the sick man should not be quick enough in taking the necessary precautions, presently, when his drowned books and watch are seen barely emerging from the milky tide, he will be obliged to call the old nurse who, though he be himself an eminent statesman or a famous writer, will tell him that he has no more sense than a child of five. At other times in the magic chamber, between us and the closed door, a person who was not there a moment ago makes his appearance; it is a visitor whom we did not hear coming in, and who merely gesticulates, like a figure in one of those little puppet theatres, so restful for those who have taken a dislike to the spoken tongue. And for this totally deaf man, since the loss of a sense adds as much beauty to the world as its acquisition, it is with ecstasy that he walks now upon an earth grown almost an Eden, in which sound has not yet been created. The highest waterfalls unfold for his eyes alone their ribbons of crystal, stiller than the glassy sea, like the cascades of Paradise. As sound was for him before his deafness the perceptible form in which the cause of a movement was draped, objects moved without sound seemed to be being moved also without cause; deprived of all resonant quality, they shew a spontaneous activity, seem to be alive. They move, halt, become alight of their own accord. Of their own accord they vanish in the air like the winged monsters of prehistoric days. In the solitary and unneighboured home of the deaf man the service which, before his infirmity was complete, was already shewing an increased discretion, was being carried on in silence, is now assured him with a sort of surreptitious deftness, by mutes, as at the court of a fairy-tale king. And, as upon the stage, the building on which the deaf man looks from his window \u2014 be it barracks, church, or town hall \u2014 is only so much scenery. If one day it should fall to the ground, it may emit a cloud of dust and leave visible ruins; but, less material even than a palace on the stage, though it has not the same exiguity, it will subside in the magic universe without letting the fall of its heavy blocks of stone tarnish, with anything so vulgar as sound, the chastity of the prevailing silence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The silence, though only relative, which reigned in the little barrack-room where I sat waiting was now broken. The door opened and Saint-Loup, dropping his eyeglass, dashed in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, my dear Robert, you make yourself very comfortable here,\u201d I said to him; \u201chow jolly it would be if one were allowed to dine and sleep here.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And to be sure, had it not been against the regulations, what repose untinged by sadness I could have tasted there, guarded by that atmosphere of tranquillity, vigilance and gaiety which was maintained by a thousand wills controlled and free from care, a thousand heedless spirits, in that great community called a barracks where, time having taken the form of action, the sad bell that tolled the hours outside was replaced by the same joyous clarion of those martial calls, the ringing memory of which was kept perpetually alive in the paved streets of the town, like the dust that floats in a sunbeam; \u2014 a voice sure of being heard, and musical because it was the command not only of authority to obedience but of wisdom to happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you\u2019d rather stay with me and sleep here, would you, than to go the hotel by yourself?\u201d Saint-Loup asked me, smiling\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Robert, it is cruel of you to be sarcastic about it,\u201d I pleaded; \u201cyou know it\u2019s not possible, and you know how wretched I shall be over there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood! You flatter me!\u201d he replied. \u201cIt occurred to me just now that you would rather stay here to-night. And that is precisely what I stopped to ask the Captain.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd he has given you leave?\u201d I cried\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe hadn\u2019t the slightest objection.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! I adore him!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; that would be going too far. But now, let me just get hold of my batman and tell him to see about our dinner,\u201d he went on, while I turned away so as to hide my tears\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were several times interrupted by one or other of Saint-Loup\u2019s friends\u2019 coming in. He drove them all out again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGet out of here. Buzz off!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I begged him to let them stay\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, really; they would bore you stiff; they are absolutely uncultured; all they can talk about is racing, or stables shop. Besides, I don\u2019t want them here either; they would spoil these precious moments I\u2019ve been looking forward to. But you mustn\u2019t think, when I tell you that these fellows are brainless, that everything military is devoid of intellectuality. Far from it. We have a major here who is a splendid chap. He\u2019s given us a course in which military history is treated like a demonstration, like a problem in algebra. Even from the aesthetic point of view there is a curious beauty, alternately inductive and deductive, about it which you couldn\u2019t fail to appreciate.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s not the officer who\u2019s given me leave to stay here to-night?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; thank God! The man you \u2018adore\u2019 for so very trifling a service is the biggest fool that ever walked the face of the earth. He is perfect at looking after messing, and at kit inspections; he spends hours with the serjeant major and the master tailor. There you have his mentality. Apart from that he has a vast contempt, like everyone here, for the excellent major I was telling you about. No one will speak to him because he\u2019s a freemason and doesn\u2019t go to confession. The Prince de Borodino would never have an outsider like that in his house. Which is pretty fair cheek, when all\u2019s said and done, from a man whose great-grandfather was a small farmer, and who would probably be a small farmer himself if it hadn\u2019t been for the Napoleonic wars. Not that he hasn\u2019t a lurking sense of his own rather ambiguous position in society, where he\u2019s neither flesh nor fowl. He hardly ever shews his face at the Jockey, it makes him feel so deuced awkward, this so-called Prince,\u201d added Robert, who, having been led by the same spirit of imitation to adopt the social theories of his teachers and the worldly prejudices of his relatives, had unconsciously wedded the democratic love of humanity to a contempt for the nobility of the Empire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was looking at the photograph of his aunt, and the thought that, since Saint-Loup had this photograph in his possession, he might perhaps give it to me, made me feel all the fonder of him and hope to do him a thousand services, which seemed to me a very small exchange for it. For this photograph was like one encounter more, added to all those that I had already had, with Mme. de Guermantes; better still, a prolonged encounter, as if, by some sudden stride forward in our relations, she had stopped beside me, in a garden hat, and had allowed me for the first time to gaze at my leisure at that plump cheek, that arched neck, that tapering eyebrow (veiled from me hitherto by the swiftness of her passage, the bewilderment of my impressions, the imperfection of memory); and the contemplation of them, as well as of the bare bosom and arms of a woman whom I had never seen save in a high-necked and long-sleeved bodice, was to me a voluptuous discovery, a priceless favour. Those lines, which had seemed to me almost a forbidden spectacle, I could study there, as in a text-book of the only geometry that had any value for me. Later on, when I looked at Robert, I noticed that he too was a little like the photograph of his aunt, and by a mysterious process which I found almost as moving, since, if his face had not been directly created by hers, the two had nevertheless a common origin. The features of the Duchesse de Guermantes, which were pinned to my vision of Combray, the nose like a falcon\u2019s beak, the piercing eyes, seemed to have served also as a pattern for the cutting out \u2014 in another copy analogous and slender, with too delicate a skin \u2014 of Robert\u2019s face, which might almost be superimposed upon his aunt\u2019s. I saw in him, with a keen longing, those features characteristic of the Guermantes, of that race which had remained so individual in the midst of a world with which it was not confounded, in which it remained isolated in the glory of an ornithomorphic divinity, for it seemed to have been the issue, in the age of mythology, of the union of a goddess with a bird\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert, without being aware of its cause, was touched by my evident affection. This was moreover increased by the sense of comfort inspired in me by the heat of the fire and by the champagne which bedewed at the same time my brow with beads of sweat and my cheeks with tears; it washed down the partridges; I ate mine with the dumb wonder of a profane mortal of any sort when he finds in a form of life with which he is not familiar what he has supposed that form of life to exclude \u2014 the wonder, for instance, of an atheist who sits down to an exquisitely cooked dinner in a presbytery. And next morning, when I awoke, I rose and went to cast from Saint-Loup\u2019s window, which being at a great height overlooked the whole countryside, a curious scrutiny to make the acquaintance of my new neighbour, the landscape which I had not been able to distinguish the day before, having arrived too late, at an hour when it was already sleeping beneath the outspread cloak of night. And yet, early as it had awoken from its sleep, I could see the ground, when I opened the window and looked out, only as one sees it from the window of a country house, overlooking the lake, shrouded still in its soft white morning gown of mist which scarcely allowed me to make out anything at all. But I knew that, before the troopers who were busy with their horses in the square had finished grooming them, it would have cast its gown aside. In the meantime, I could see only a meagre hill, rearing close up against the side of the barracks a back already swept clear of darkness, rough and wrinkled. Through the transparent curtain of frost I could not take my eyes from this stranger who, too, was looking at me for the first time. But when I had formed the habit of coming to the barracks, my consciousness that the hill was there, more real, consequently, even when I did not see it, than the hotel at Balbec, than our house in Paris, of which I thought as of absent \u2014 or dead \u2014 friends, that is to say without any strong belief in their existence, brought it about that, even although I was not aware of it myself, its reflected shape outlined itself on the slightest impressions that I formed at Donci\u00e8res, and among them, to begin with this first morning, on the pleasing impression of warmth given me by the cup of chocolate prepared by Saint-Loup\u2019s batman in this comfortable room, which had the effect of being an optical centre from which to look out at the hill \u2014 the idea of there being anything else to do but just gaze at it, the idea of actually climbing it, being rendered impossible by this same mist. Imbibing the shape of the hill, associated with the taste of hot chocolate and with the whole web of my fancies at that particular time, this mist, without my having thought at all about it, succeeded in moistening all my subsequent thoughts about that period, just as a massive and unmelting lump of gold had remained allied to my impressions of Balbec, or as the proximity of the outside stairs of blackish sandstone gave a grey background to my impressions of Combray. It did not, however, persist late into the day; the sun began by hurling at it, in vain, a few darts which sprinkled it with brilliants before they finally overcame it. The hill might expose its grizzled rump to the sun\u2019s rays, which, an hour later, when I went down to the town, gave to the russet tints of the autumn leaves, to the reds and blues of the election posters pasted on the walls, an exaltation which raised my spirits also and made me stamp, singing as I went, on the pavements from which I could hardly keep myself from jumping in the air for joy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But after that first night I had to sleep at the hotel. And I knew beforehand that I was doomed to find sorrow there. It was like an unbreathable aroma which all my life long had been exhaled for me by every new bedroom, that is to say by every bedroom; in the one which I usually occupied I was not present, my mind remained elsewhere, and in its place sent only the sense of familiarity. But I could not employ this servant, less sensitive than myself, to look after things for me in a new place, where I preceded him, where I arrived by myself, where I must bring into contact with its environment that \u2018Self\u2019 which I rediscovered only at year-long intervals, but always the same, having not grown at all since Combray, since my first arrival at Balbec, weeping, without any possibility of consolation, on the edge of an unpacked trunk\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As it happened, I was mistaken. I had no time to be sad, for I was not left alone for an instant. The fact of the matter was that there remained of the old palace a superfluous refinement of structure and decoration, out of place in a modern hotel, which, released from the service of any practical purpose, had in its long spell of leisure acquired a sort of life: passages winding about in all directions, which one was continually crossing in their aimless wanderings, lobbies as long as corridors and as ornate as drawing-rooms, which had the air rather of being dwellers there themselves than of forming part of a dwelling, which could not be induced to enter and settle down in any of the rooms but wandered about outside mine and came up at once to offer me their company \u2014 neighbours of a sort, idle but never noisy, menial ghosts of the past who had been granted the privilege of staying, provided they kept quiet, by the doors of the rooms which were let to visitors, and who, every time that I came across them, greeted me with a silent deference. In short, the idea of a lodging, of simply a case for our existence from day to day which shields us only from the cold and from being overlooked by other people, was absolutely inapplicable to this house, an assembly of rooms as real as a colony of people, living, it was true, in silence, but things which one was obliged to meet, to avoid, to appreciate, as one came in. One tried not to disturb them, and one could not look without respect at the great drawing-room which had formed, far back in the eighteenth century, the habit of stretching itself at its ease, among its hangings of old gold and beneath the clouds of its painted ceiling. And one was seized with a more personal curiosity as to the smaller rooms which, without any regard for symmetry, ran all round it, innumerable, startled, fleeing in disorder as far as the garden, to which they had so easy an access down three broken steps\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If I wished to go out or to come in without taking the lift or being seen from the main staircase, a smaller private staircase, no longer in use, offered me its steps so skilfully arranged, one close above another, that there seemed to exist in their gradation a perfect proportion of the same kind as those which, in colours, scents, savours, often arouse in us a peculiar, sensuous pleasure. But the pleasure to be found in going up and downstairs I had had to come here to learn, as once before to a health resort in the Alps to find that the act \u2014 as a rule not noticed \u2014 of drawing breath could be a perpetual delight. I received that dispensation from effort which is granted to us only by the things to which long use has accustomed us, when I set my feet for the first time on those steps, familiar before ever I knew them, as if they possessed, deposited on them, perhaps, embodied in them by the masters of long ago whom they used to welcome every day, the prospective charm of habits which I had not yet contracted and which indeed could only grow weaker once they had become my own. I looked into a room; the double doors closed themselves behind me, the hangings let in a silence in which I felt myself invested with a sort of exhilarating royalty; a marble mantelpiece with ornaments of wrought brass \u2014 of which one would have been wrong to think that its sole idea was to represent the art of the Directory \u2014 offered me a fire, and a little easy chair on short legs helped me to warm myself as comfortably as if I had been sitting on the hearthrug. The walls held the room in \u00e0 close embrace, separating it from the rest of the world and, to let in, to enclose what made it complete, parted to make way for the bookcase, reserved a place for the bed, on either side of which a column airily upheld the raised ceiling of the alcove. And the room was prolonged in depth by two closets as large as itself, the latter of which had hanging from its wall, to scent the occasion on which one had recourse to it, a voluptuous rosary of orris-roots; the doors, if I left them open when I withdrew into this innermost retreat, were not content with tripling its dimensions without its ceasing to be well-proportioned, and not only allowed my eyes to enjoy the delights of extension after those of concentration, but added further to the pleasure of my solitude, which, while still inviolable, was no longer shut in, the sense of liberty. This closet looked out upon a courtyard, a fair solitary stranger whom I was glad to have for a neighbour when next morning my eyes fell on her, a captive between her high walls in which no other window opened, with nothing but two yellowing trees which were enough to give a pinkish softness to the pure sky above\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before going to bed I decided to leave the room in order to explore the whole of my fairy kingdom. I walked down a long gallery which did me homage successively with all that it had to offer me if I could not sleep, an armchair placed waiting in a corner, a spinet, on a table against the wall, a bowl of blue crockery filled with cinerarias, and, in an old frame, the phantom of a lady of long ago whose powdered hair was starred with blue flowers, holding in her hand a bunch of carnations. When I came to the end, the bare wall in which no door opened said to me simply \u201cNow you must turn and go back, but, you see, you are at home here, the house is yours,\u201d while the soft carpet, not to be left out, added that if I did not sleep that night I could easily come in barefoot, and\u2019 the unshuttered windows, looking out over the oper, country, assured me that they would hold a sleepless vigil and that, at whatever hour I chose to come in, I need not be afraid of disturbing anyone. And behind a hanging curtain I surprised only a little closet which, stopped by the wall and unable to escape any farther, had hidden itself there with a guilty conscience and gave me a frightened stare from its little round window, glowing blue in the moonlight. I went to bed, but the presence of the eiderdown quilt, of the pillars, of the neat fireplace, by straining my attention to a pitch beyond that of Paris, prevented me from letting myself go upon my habitual train of fancies. And as it is this particular state of strained attention that enfolds our slumbers, acts upon them, modifies them, brings them into line with this or that series of past impressions, the images that filled my dreams that first night were borrowed from a memory entirely distinct from that on which I was in the habit of drawing. If I had been tempted while asleep to let myself be swept back upon my ordinary current of remembrance, the bed to which I was not accustomed, the comfortable attention which I was obliged to pay to the position of my various limbs when I turned over, were sufficient to correct my error, to disentangle and to keep running the new thread of my dreams. It is the same with sleep as with our perception of the external world. It needs only a modification in our habits to make it poetic, it is enough that while undressing we should have dozed off unconsciously upon the bed, for the dimensions of our dream-world to be altered and its beauty felt. We awake, look at our watch, see \u2018four o\u2019clock\u2019; it is only four o\u2019clock in the morning, but we imagine that the whole day has gone by, so vividly does this nap of a few minutes, unsought by us, appear to have come down to us from the skies, by virtue of some divine right, full-bodied, vast, like an Emperor\u2019s orb of gold. In the morning, while worrying over the thought that my grandfather was ready, and was waiting for me to start on our walk along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, I was awakened by the blare of a regimental band which passed every day beneath my windows. But on several occasions \u2014 and I mention these because one cannot properly describe human life unless one shews it soaked in the sleep in which it plunges, which, night after night, sweeps round it as a promontory is encircled by the sea \u2014 the intervening layer of sleep was strong enough to bear the shock of the music and I heard nothing. On the other mornings it gave way for a moment; but, still velvety with the refreshment of having slept, my consciousness (like those organs by which, after a local anaesthetic, a cauterisation, not perceived at first, is felt only at the very end and then as a faint burning smart) was touched only gently by the shrill points of the fifes which caressed it with a vague, cool, matutinal warbling; and after this brief interruption in which the silence had turned to music it relapsed into my slumber before even the dragoons had finished passing, depriving me of the latest opening buds of the sparkling clangorous nosegay. And the zone of my consciousness which its springing stems had brushed was so narrow, so circumscribed with sleep that later on, when Saint-Loup asked me whether I had heard the band, I was no longer ertain that the sound of its brasses had not been as imaginary as that which I heard during the day echo, after the slightest noise, from the paved streets of the town. Perhaps I had heard it only in a dream, prompted by my fear of being awakened, or else of not being awakened and so not seeing the regiment march past. For often, when I was still asleep at the moment when, on the contrary, I had supposed that the noise would awaken me, for the next hour I imagined that I was awake, while still drowsing, and I enacted to myself with tenuous shadow-shapes on the screen of my slumber the various scenes of which it deprived me but at which I had the illusion of looking on\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What one has meant to do during the day, as it turns out, sleep intervening, one accomplishes only in one\u2019s dreams, that is to say after it has been distorted by sleep into following another line than one would have chosen when awake. The same story branches off and has a different ending. When all is said, the world in which we live when we are asleep is so different that people who have difficulty in going to sleep seek first of all to escape from the waking world. After having desperately, for hours on end, with shut eyes, revolved in their minds thoughts similar to those which they would have had with their eyes open, they take heart again on noticing that the last minute has been crawling under the weight of an argument in formal contradiction of the laws of thought, and their realisation of this, and the brief \u2018absence\u2019 to which it points, indicate that the door is now open through which they will perhaps be able, presently, to escape from the perception of the real, to advance to a resting-place more or less remote on the other side, which will mean their having a more or less \u2018good\u2019 night. But already a great stride has been made when we turn our back on the real, when we reach the cave in which \u2018auto-suggestions\u2019 prepare \u2014 like witches \u2014 the hell-broth of imaginary maladies or of the recurrence of nervous disorders, and watch for the hour at which the storm that has been gathering during our unconscious sleep will break with sufficient force to make sleep cease\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not far thence is the secret garden in which grow like strange flowers the kinds of sleep, so different one from another, the sleep induced by datura, by the multiple extracts of ether, the sleep of belladonna, of opium, of valerian, flowers whose petals remain shut until the day when the predestined visitor shall come and, touching them, bid them open, and for long hours inhale the aroma of their peculiar dreams into a marvelling and bewildered being. At the end of the garden stands the convent with open windows through which we hear voices repeating the lessons learned before we went to sleep, which we shall know only at the moment of awakening; while, a presage of that moment, sounds the resonant tick of that inward alarum which our preoccupation has so effectively regulated that when our housekeeper comes in with the warning: \u201cIt is seven o\u2019clock,\u201d she will find us awake and ready. On the dim walls of that chamber which opens upon our dreams, within which toils without ceasing that oblivion of the sorrows of love whose task, interrupted and brought: to nought at times by a nightmare big with reminiscence, is ever speedily resumed, hang, even after we are awake, the memories of our dreams, but so overshadowed that otten we catch sight of them for the first time only in the broad light of the afternoon when the ray of a similar idea happens by chance to strike them; some of them brilliant and harmonious while we slept, but already so distorted that, having failed to recognise them, we can but hasten to lay them in the earth like dead bodies too quickly decomposed or relics so seriously damaged, so nearly crumbling into dust that the most skilful restorer could not bring them back to their true form or make anything of them. Near the gate is the quarry to which our heavier slumbers repair in search of substances which coat the brain with so unbreakable a glaze that, to awaken the sleeper, his own will is obliged, even on a golden morning, to smite him with mighty blows like a young Siegfried. Beyond this, again, are the nightmares of which the doctors foolishly assert that they tire us more than does insomnia, whereas on the contrary they enable the thinker to escape from the strain of thought; those nightmares with their fantastic picture-books in which our relatives who are dead are shewn meeting with a serious accident which at the same time does not preclude their speedy recovery. Until then we keep them in a little rat-cage, in which they are smaller than white mice and, covered with big red spots, out of each of which a feather sprouts, engage us in Ciceronian dialogues. Next to this picture-book is the revolving disc of awakening, by virtue of which we submit for a moment to the tedium of having to return at once to a house which was pulled down fifty years ago, the memory of which is gradually effaced as sleep grows more distant by a number of others, until we arrive at that memory which the disc presents only when it has ceased to revolve and which coincides with what we shall see with opened eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I had heard nothing, being in one of those slumbers into which we fall as into a pit from which we are heartily glad to be drawn up a little later, heavy, overfed, digesting all that has been brought to us (as by the nymphs who fed the infant Hercules) by those agile, vegetative powers whose activity is doubled while we sleep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That kind of sleep is called \u2018sleeping like lead,\u2019 and it seems as though one has become, oneself, and remains for a few moments after such a sleep is ended, simply a leaden image. One is no longer a person. How then, seeking for one\u2019s mind, one\u2019s personality, as one seeks for a thing that is lost, does one recover one\u2019s own self rather than any other? Why, when one begins again to think, is it not another personality than yesterday\u2019s that is incarnate in one? One fails to see what can dictate the choice, or why, among the millions of human beings any one of whom one might be, it is on him who one was overnight that unerringly one lays one\u2019s hand? What is it that guides us, when there has been an actual interruption \u2014 whether it be that our unconsciousness has been complete or our dreams entirely different from ourselves? There has indeed been death, as when the heart has ceased to beat and a rhythmical friction of the tongue revives us. No doubt the room, even if we have seen it only once before, awakens memories to which other, older memories cling. Or were some memories also asleep in us of which we now become conscious? The resurrection at our awakening \u2014 after that healing attack of mental alienation which is sleep \u2014 must after all be similar to what occurs when we recapture a name, a line, a refrain that we had forgotten. And perhaps the resurrection of the soul after death is to be conceived as a phenomenon of memory\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I had finished sleeping, tempted by the sunlit sky \u2014 but discouraged by the chill \u2014 of those last autumn mornings, so luminous and so cold, in which winter begins, to get up and look at the trees on which the leaves were indicated now only by a few strokes, golden or rosy, which seemed to have been left in the air, on an invisible web, I raised my head from the pillow and stretched my neck, keeping my body still hidden beneath the bedclothes; like a chrysalis in the process of change I was a dual creature, with the different parts of which a single environment did not agree; for my eyes colour was sufficient, without warmth; my chest on the other hand was anxious for warmth and not for colour. I rose only after my fire had been lighted, and studied the picture, so delicate and transparent, of the pink and golden morning, to which I had now added by artificial means the element of warmth that it lacked, poking my fire which burned and smoked like a good pipe and gave me, as a pipe would have given me, a pleasure at once coarse because it was based upon a material comfort and delicate because beyond it was printed a pure vision. The walls of my dressing-room were covered with a paper on which a violent red background was patterned with black and white flowers, to which it seemed that I should have some difficulty in growing accustomed. But they succeeded only in striking me as novel, in forcing me to enter not into conflict but into contact with them, in modulating the gaiety, the songs of my morning toilet, they succeeded only in imprisoning me in the heart of a sort of poppy, out of which to look at a world which I saw quite differently from in Paris, from the gay screen which was this new dwelling-place, of a different aspect from the house of my parents, and into which flowed a purer air. On certain days, I was agitated by the desire to see my grandmother again, or by the fear that she might be ill, or else it was the memory of some undertaking which I had left half-finished in Paris, and which seemed to have made no progress; sometimes again it was some difficulty in which, even here, I had managed to become involved. One or other of these anxieties had kept me from sleeping, and I was without strength to face my sorrow which in a moment grew to fill the whole of my existence. Then from the hotel I sent a messenger to the barracks, with a line to Saint-Loup: I told him that, should it be materially possible \u2014 I knew that it was extremely difficult for him \u2014 I should be most grateful if he would look in for a minute. An hour later he arrived; and on hearing his ring at the door I felt myself liberated from my obsessions. I knew that, if they were stronger than I, he was stronger than they, and my attention was diverted from them and concentrated on him who would have to settle them. He had come into the room, and already he had enveloped me in the gust of fresh air in which from before dawn he had been displaying so much activity, a vital atmosphere very different from that of my room, to which I at once adapted myself by appropriate reactions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope you weren\u2019t angry with me for bothering you; there is something that is worrying me, as you probably guessed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all; I just supposed you wanted to see me, and I thought it very nice of you. I was delighted that you should have sent for me. But what is the trouble? Things not going well? What can I do to help?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He listened to my explanations, and gave careful answers; but before he had uttered a word he had transformed me to his own likeness; compared with the important occupations which kept him so busy, so alert, so happy, the worries which, a moment ago, I had been unable to endure for another instant seemed to me as to him negligible; I was like a man who, not having been able to open his eyes for some days, sends for a doctor, who neatly and gently raises his eyelid, removes from beneath it and shews him a grain of sand; the sufferer is healed and comforted. All my cares resolved themselves into a telegram which Saint-Loup undertook to dispatch. Life seemed to me so different, so delightful; I was flooded with such a surfeit of strength that I longed for action\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d I asked him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI must leave you, I\u2019m afraid; we\u2019re going on a route march in three quarters of an hour, and I have to be on parade.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen it\u2019s been a great bother to you, coming here?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no bother at all, the Captain was very good about it; he told me that if it was for you I must go at once; but you understand, I don\u2019t like to seem to be abusing the privilege.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut if I got up and dressed quickly and went by myself to the place where you\u2019ll be training, it would interest me immensely, and I could perhaps talk to you during the breaks.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI shouldn\u2019t advise you to do that; you have been lying awake, racking your brains over a thing which, I assure you, is not of the slightest importance, but now that it has ceased to worry you, lay your head down on the pillow and go to sleep, which you will find an excellent antidote to the d\u00e9min\u00e9ralisation of your nerve-cells; only you mustn\u2019t go to sleep too soon, because our band-boys will be coming along under your windows; but as soon as they\u2019ve passed I think you\u2019ll be left in peace, and we shall meet again this evening, at dinner.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But soon I was constantly going to see the regiment being trained in field operations, when I began to take an interest in the military theories which Saint-Loup\u2019s friends used to expound over the dinner-table, and when it had become the chief desire of my life to see at close quarters their various leaders, just as a person who makes music his principal study and spends his life in the concert halls finds pleasure in frequenting the caf\u00e9s in which one mingles with the life of the members of the orchestra. To reach the training ground I used to have to take tremendously long walks. In the evening after dinner the longing for sleep made my head drop every now and then as in a swoon. Next morning I realised that I had no more heard the band than, at Balbec, after the evenings on which Saint-Loup had taken me to dinner at Rivebelle, I used to hear the concert on the beach. And at the moment when I wished to rise I had a delicious feeling of incapacity; I felt myself fastened to a deep, invisible ground by the articulations (of which my tiredness made me conscious) of muscular and nutritious roots. I felt myself full of strength; life seemed to extend more amply before me; this was because I had reverted to the good tiredness of my childhood at Combray on the mornings following days on which we had taken the Guermantes walk. Poets make out that we recapture for a moment the self that we were long ago when we enter some house or garden in which we used to live in our youth. But these are most hazardous pilgrimages, which end as often in disappointment as in success. The fixed places, contemporary with different years, it is in ourselves that we should rather seek to find them. This is where the advantage comes in, to a certain extent, of great exhaustion followed by a good night\u2019s rest. Good nights, to make us descend into the most subterranean galleries of sleep, where no reflexion from overnight, no gleam of memory comes to lighten the inward monologue (if so be that it cease not also), turn so effectively the soil and break through the surface stone of our body that we discover there, where our muscles dive down and throw out their twisted roots and breathe the air of the new life, the garden in which as a child we used to play. There is no need to travel in order to see it again; we must dig down inwardly to discover it. What once covered the earth is no longer upon it but beneath; a mere excursion does not suffice for a visit to the dead city, excavation is necessary also. But we shall see how certain impressions, fugitive and fortuitous, carry us back even more effectively to the past, with a more delicate precision, with a flight more light-winged, more immaterial, more headlong, more unerring, more immortal than these organic dislocations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes my exhaustion was greater still; I had, without any opportunity of going to bed, been following the operations for several days on end. How blessed then was my return to the hotel! As I got into bed I seemed to have escaped at last from the hands of enchanters, sorcerers like those who people the \u2018romances\u2019 beloved of our forebears in the seventeenth century. My sleep that night and the lazy morning that followed it were no more than a charming fairy tale. Charming; beneficent perhaps also. I reminded myself that the keenest sufferings have their place of sanctuary, that one can always, when all else fails, find repose. These thoughts carried me far\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On days when, although there was no parade, Saint-Loup had to stay in barracks, I used often to go and visit him there. It was a long way; I had to leave the town and cross the viaduct, from either side of which I had an immense view. A strong breeze blew almost always over this high ground, and filled all the buildings erected on three sides of the barrack-square, which howled incessantly like a cave of the winds. While I waited for Robert \u2014 he being engaged on some duty or other \u2014 outside the door of his room or in the mess, talking to some of his friends to whom he had introduced me (and whom later on I came now and then to see, even when he was not to be there), looking down from the window three hundred feet to the country below, bare now except where recently sown fields, often still soaked with rain and glittering in the sun, shewed a few stripes of green, of the brilliance and translucent limpidity of enamel, I could hear him discussed by the others, and I soon learned what a popular favourite he was. Among many of the volunteers, belonging to other squadrons^ sons of rich business or professional men who looked at the higher aristocratic society only from outside and without penetrating its enclosure, the attraction which they naturally felt towards what they knew of Saint-Loup\u2019s character was reinforced by the distinction that attached in their eyes to the young man whom, on Saturday evenings, when they went on pass to Paris, they had seen supping in the Caf\u00e9 de la Paix with the Duc d\u2019Uz\u00e8s and the Prince d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans. And on that account, into his handsome face, his casual way of walking and saluting officers, the perpetual dance of his eyeglass, the affectation shewn in the cut of his service dress \u2014 the caps always too high, the breeches of too fine a cloth and too pink a shade \u2014 they had introduced the idea of a \u2018tone\u2019 which, they were positive, was lacking in the best turned-out officers in the regiment, even the majestic Captain to whom I had been indebted for the privilege of sleeping in barracks, who seemed, in comparison, too pompous and almost common\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of them said that the Captain had bought a new horse. \u201cHe can buy as many horses as he likes. I passed Saint-Loup on Sunday morning in the All\u00e9e des Acacias; now he\u2019s got some style on a horse!\u201d replied his companion, and knew what he was talking about, for these young fellows belonged to a class which, if it does not frequent the same houses and know the same people, yet, thanks to money and leisure, does not differ from the nobility in its experience of all those refinements of life which money can procure. At any rate their refinement had, in the matter of clothes, for instance, something about it more studied, more impeccable than that free and easy negligence which had so delighted my grandmother in Saint-Loup. It gave quite a thrill to these sons of big stockbrokers or bankers, as they sat eating oysters after the theatre, to see at an adjoining table Serjeant Saint-Loup. And what a tale there was to tell in barracks on Monday night, after a week-end leave, by one of them who was in Robert\u2019s squadron, and to whom he had said how d\u2019ye do \u2018most civilly,\u2019 while another, who was not in the same squadron, was quite positive that, in spite of this, Saint-Loup had recognised him, for two or three times he had put up his eyeglass and stared in the speaker\u2019s direction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, my brother saw him at the Paix,\u201d said another, who had been spending the day with his mistress; \u201cmy brother says his dress coat was cut too loose and didn\u2019t fit him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat was the waistcoat like?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe wasn\u2019t wearing a white waistcoat; it was purple, with sort of palms on it; stunning!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the \u2018old soldiers\u2019 (sons of the soil who had never heard of the Jockey Club and simply put Saint-Loup in the category of ultra-rich non-commissioned officers, in which they included all those who, whether bankrupt or not, lived in a certain style, whose income or debts ran into several figures, and who were generous towards their men), the gait, the eyeglass, the breeches, the caps of Saint-Loup, even if they saw in them nothing particularly aristocratic, furnished nevertheless just as much interest and meaning. They recognised in these peculiarities the character, the style which they had assigned once and for all time to this most popular of the \u2018stripes\u2019 in the regiment, manners like no one\u2019s else, scornful indifference to what his superior officers might think, which seemed to them the natural corollary of his goodness to his subordinates. The morning cup of coffee in the canteen, the afternoon \u2018lay-down\u2019 in the barrack-room seemed pleasanter, somehow, when some old soldier fed the hungering, lazy section with some savoury titbit as to a cap in which Saint-Loup had appeared on parade\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt was the height of my pack.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome off it, old chap, you don\u2019t expect us to believe that; it couldn\u2019t have been the height of your pack,\u201d interrupted a young college graduate who hoped by using these slang terms not to appear a \u2018learned beggar,\u2019 and by venturing on this contradiction to obtain confirmation of a fact the thought of which enchanted him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, so it wasn\u2019t the height of my pack, wasn\u2019t it? You measured it, I suppose! I tell you this much, the C. O. glared at it as if he\u2019d have liked to put him in clink. But you needn\u2019t think the great Saint-Loup felt squashed; no, he went and he came, and down with his head and up with his head, and that blinking glass screwed in his eye all the time. We\u2019ll see what the \u2018Capstan\u2019 has to say when he hears. Oh, very likely he\u2019ll say nothing, but you may be sure he won\u2019t be pleased. But there\u2019s nothing so wonderful about that cap. I hear he\u2019s got thirty of \u2019em and more at home, at his house in town.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere did you hear that, old man? From our blasted corporal-dog?\u201d asked the young graduate, pedantically displaying the new forms of speech which he had only recently acquired and with which he took a pride in garnishing his conversation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere did I hear it? From his batman; what d\u2019you think?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Now you\u2019re talking. That\u2019s a chap who knows when he\u2019s well off!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should say so! He\u2019s got more in his pocket than I have, certain sure! And besides he gives him all his own things, and everything. He wasn\u2019t getting his grub properly, he says. Along comes de Saint-Loup, and gives cooky hell: \u2018I want him to be properly fed, d\u2019you hear,\u2019 he says, \u2018and I don\u2019t care what it costs.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The old soldier made up for the triviality of the words quoted by the emphasis of his tone, in a feeble imitation of the speaker which had an immense success\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On leaving the barracks I would take a stroll, and then, to fill up the time before I went, as I did every evening, to dine with Saint-Loup at the hotel in which he and his friends had established their mess, I made for my own, as soon as the sun had set, so as to have a couple of hours in which to rest and read. In the square, the evening light bedecked the pepper-pot turrets of the castle with little pink clouds which matched the colour of the bricks, and completed the harmony by softening the tone of the latter where it bathed them. So strong a current of vitality coursed through my nerves that no amount of movement on my part could exhaust it; each step I took, after touching a stone of the pavement, rebounded off it. I seemed to have growing on my heels the wings of Mercury. One of the fountains was filled with a ruddy glow, while in the other the moonlight had already begun to turn the water opalescent. Between them were children at play, uttering shrill cries, wheeling in circles, obeying some necessity of the hour, like swifts or bats. Next door to the hotel, the old National Courts and the Louis XVI orangery, in which were installed now the savings-bank and the Army Corps headquarters, were lighted from within by the palely gilded globes of their gas-jets which, seen in the still clear daylight outside, suited those vast, tall, eighteenth-century windows from which the last rays of the setting sun had not yet departed, as would have suited a complexion heightened with rouge a headdress of yellow tortoise-shell, and persuaded me to seek out my fireside and the lamp which, alone in the shadowy front of my hotel, was striving to resist the gathering darkness, and for the sake of which I went indoors before it was quite dark, for pleasure, as to an appetising meal. I kept, when I was in my room, the same fulness of sensation that I had felt outside. It gave such an apparent convexity of surface to things which as a rule seem flat and empty, to the yellow flame of the fire, the coarse blue paper on the ceiling, on which the setting sun had scribbled corkscrews and whirligigs, like a schoolboy with a piece of red chalk, the curiously patterned cloth on the round table, on which a ream of essay paper and an inkpot lay in readiness for me, with one of Bergotte\u2019s novels, that ever since then these things have continued to seem to me to be enriched with a whole form of existence which I feel that I should be able to extract from them if it were granted me to set eyes on them again. I thought with joy of the barracks that I had just left and of their weather-cock turning with every wind that blew. Like a diver breathing through a pipe which rises above the surface of the water, I felt that I was in a sense maintaining contact with a healthy, open-air life when I kept as a baiting-place those barracks, that towering observatory, dominating a country-side furrowed with canals of green enamel, into whose various buildings I esteemed as a priceless privilege, which I hoped would last, my freedom to go whenever I chose, always certain of a welcome\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At seven o\u2019clock I dressed myself and went out again to dine with Saint-Loup at the hotel where he took his meals. I liked to go there on foot. It was by now pitch dark, and after the third day of my visit there began to blow, as soon as night had fallen, an icy wind which seemed a harbinger of snow. As I walked, I ought not, strictly speaking, to have ceased for a moment to think of Mme. de Guermantes; it was only in the attempt to draw nearer to her that I had come to visit Robert\u2019s garrison. But a memory, a grief, are fleeting things. There are days when they remove so far that we are barely conscious of them, we think that they have gone for ever. Then we pay attention to other things. And the streets of this town had not yet become for me what streets are in the place where one is accustomed to live, simply means of communication between one part and another. The life led by the inhabitants of this unknown world must, it seemed to me, be a marvellous thing, and often the lighted windows of some dwelling-house kept me standing for a long while motionless in the darkness by laying before my eyes the actual and mysterious scenes of an existence into which I might not penetrate. Here the fire-spirit displayed to me in purple colouring the booth of a chestnut seller in which a couple of serjeants, their belts slung over the backs of chairs, were playing cards, never dreaming that a magician\u2019s wand was making them emerge from the night, like a transparency on the stage, and presenting them in their true lineaments at that very moment to the eyes of an arrested passerby whom they could not see. In a little curiosity shop a candle, burned almost to its socket, projecting its warm glow over an engraving reprinted it in sanguine, while, battling against the darkness, the light of the big lamp tanned a scrap of leather, inlaid a dagger with fiery spangles, on pictures which were only bad copies spread a priceless film of gold like the patina of time or the varnish used by a master, made in fact of the whole hovel, in which there was nothing but pinchbeck rubbish, a marvellous composition by Rembrandt. Sometimes I lifted my gaze to some huge old dwelling-house on which the shutters had not been closed and in which amphibious men and women floated slowly to and fro in the rich liquid that after nightfall rose incessantly from the wells of the lamps to fill the rooms to the very brink of the outer walls of stone and glass, the movement of their bodies sending through it long unctuous golden ripples. I proceeded on my way, and often, in the dark alley that ran past the cathedral, as long ago on the road to M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, the force of my desire caught and held me; it seemed that a woman must be on the point of appearing, to satisfy it; if, in the darkness, I felt suddenly brush past me a skirt, the violence of the pleasure which I then felt made it impossible for me to believe that the contact was accidental and I attempted to seize in my arms a terrified stranger. This gothic alley meant for me something so real that if I had been successful in raising and enjoying a woman there, it would have been impossible for me not to believe that it was the ancient charm of the place that was bringing us together, and even though she were no more than a common street-walker, stationed there every evening, still the wintry night, the strange place, the darkness, the mediaeval atmosphere would have lent her their mysterious glamour. I thought of what might be in store for me; to try to forget Mme. de Guermantes seemed to me a dreadful thing, but reasonable, and for the first time possible, easy perhaps even. In the absolute quiet of this neighbourhood I could hear ahead of me shouted words and laughter which must come from tipsy revellers staggering home. I waited to see them, I stood peering in the direction from which I had heard the sound. But I was obliged to wait for some time, for the surrounding silence was so intense that it allowed to travel with the utmost clearness and strength sounds that were still a long way off. Finally the revellers did appear; not, as I had supposed, in front of me, but ever so far behind. Whether the intersection of sidestreets, the interposition of buildings had, by reverberation, brought about this acoustic error, or because it is very difficult to locate a sound when the place from which it comes is not known, I had been as far wrong over direction as over distance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wind grew stronger. It was thick and bristling with coming snow. I returned to the main street and jumped on board the little tramway-car on which, from its platform, an officer, without apparently seeing them, was acknowledging the salutes of the loutish soldiers who trudged past along the pavement, their faces daubed crimson by the cold, reminding me, in this little town which the sudden leap from autumn into early winter seemed to have transported farther north, of the rubicund faces which Breughel gives to his merry, junketing, frostbound peasants\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And sure enough at the hotel where I was to meet Saint-Loup and his friends and to which the fair now beginning had attracted a number of people from near and far, I found, as I hurried across the courtyard with its glimpses of glowing kitchens in which chickens were turning on spits, pigs were roasting, lobsters being flung, alive, into what the landlord called the \u2018everlasting fire,\u2019 an influx (worthy of some Numbering of the People Before Bethlehem such as the old Flemish masters used to paint) of new arrivals who assembled there in groups, asking the landlord or one of his staff (who, if he did not like the look of them, would recommend lodgings elsewhere in the town) whether they could have dinner and beds, while a scullion hurried past holding a struggling fowl by the neck. And similarly, in the big dining-room which I crossed the first day before coming to the smaller room in which my friend was waiting for me, it was of some feast in the Gospels portrayed with a mediaeval simplicity and an exaggeration typically Flemish that one was reminded by the quantity of fish, pullets, grouse, woodcock, pigeons, brought in dressed and garnished and piping hot by breathless waiters who slid over the polished floor to gain speed and set them down on the huge carving table where they were at once cut up but where \u2014 for most of the people had nearly finished dinner when I arrived \u2014 they accumulated untouched, as though their profusion and the haste of those who brought them in were due not so much to the requirements of the diners as to respect for the sacred text, scrupulously followed in the letter but quaintly illustrated by real details borrowed from local custom, and to an aesthetic and religious scruple for making evident to the eye the solemnity of the feast by the profusion of the victuals and the assiduity of the servers. One of these stood lost in thought at the far end of the room by a sideboard; and to find out from him, who alone appeared calm enough to be capable of answering me, in which room our table had been laid, making my way forward among the chafing-dishes that had been lighted here and there to keep the late comers\u2019 plates from growing cold (which did not, however, prevent the dessert, in the centre of the room, from being piled on the outstretched hands of a huge mannikin, sometimes supported on the wings of a duck, apparently of crystal, but really of ice, carved afresh every day with a hot iron by a sculptor-cook, quite in the Flemish manner), I went straight \u2014 at the risk of being knocked down by his colleagues \u2014 towards this servitor, in whom I felt that I recognised a character who is traditionally present in all these sacred subjects, for he reproduced with scrupulous accuracy the blunt features, fatuous and ill-drawn, the musing expression, already half aware of the miracle of a divine presence which the others have not yet begun to suspect. I should add that, in view probably of the coming fair, this presentation was strengthened by a celestial contingent, recruited in mass, of cherubim and seraphim. A young angel musician, whose fair hair enclosed a fourteen-year-old face, was not, it was true, playing on any instrument, but stood musing before a gong or a pile of plates, while other less infantile angels flew swiftly across the boundless expanse of the room, beating the air with the ceaseless fluttering of the napkins which fell along the lines of their bodies like the wings in \u2018primitive\u2019 paintings, with pointed ends. Fleeing those ill-defined regions, screened by a hedge of palms through which the angelic servitors looked, from a distance, as though they had floated down out of the empyrean, I explored my way to the smaller room in which Saint-Loup\u2019s table was laid. I found there several of his friends who dined with him regularly, nobles except for one or two commoners in whom the young nobles had, in their school days, detected likely friends, and with whom they readily associated, proving thereby that they were not on principle hostile to the middle class, even though it were Republican, provided it had clean hands and went to mass. On the first of these evenings, before we sat down to dinner, I drew Saint-Loup into a corner and, in front of all the rest but so that they should not hear me, said to him:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert, this is hardly the time or the place for what I am going to say, but I shan\u2019t be a second. I keep on forgetting to ask you when I\u2019m in the barracks; isn\u2019t that Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s photograph that you have on your table?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes; my good aunt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course she is; what a fool I am; you told me before that she was; I\u2019d forgotten all about her being your aunt. I say, your friends will be getting impatient, we must be quick, they\u2019re looking at us; another time will do; it isn\u2019t at all important.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s all right; go on as long as you like. They can wait.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no; I do want to be polite to them; they\u2019re so nice; besides, it doesn\u2019t really matter in the least, I assure you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you know that worthy Oriane, then?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This \u2018worthy Oriane,\u2019 as he might have said, \u2018that good Oriane,\u2019 did not imply that Saint-Loup regarded Mme. de Guermantes as especially good. In this instance the words \u2018good,\u2019 \u2018excellent,\u2019 \u2018worthy\u2019 are mere reinforcements of the demonstrative \u2018that,\u2019 indicating a person who is known to both parties and of whom the speaker does not quite know what to say to someone outside the intimate circle. The word \u2018good\u2019 does duty as a stopgap and keeps the conversation going for a moment until the speaker has hit upon \u201cDo you see much of her?\u201d or \u201cI haven\u2019t set eyes on her for months,\u201d or \u201cI shall be seeing her on Tuesday,\u201d or \u201cShe must be getting on, now, you know.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how funny it is that it should be her photograph, because we\u2019re living in her house now, in Paris, and I\u2019ve been hearing the most astounding things\u201d (I should have been hard put to it to say what) \u201cabout her, which have made me immensely interested in her, only from a literary point of view, don\u2019t you know, from a \u2014 how shall I put it \u2014 from a Balzacian point of view; but you\u2019re so clever you can see what I mean; I don\u2019t need to explain things to you; but we must hurry up; what on earth will your friends think of my manners?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey will think absolutely nothing; I have told them that you are sublime, and they are a great deal more alarmed than you are.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are too kind. But listen, what I want to say is this: I suppose Mme. de Guermantes hasn\u2019t any idea that I know you, has she?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t say; I haven\u2019t seen her since the summer, because I haven\u2019t had any leave since she\u2019s been in town.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat I was going to say is this: I\u2019ve been told that she looks on me as an absolute idiot.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat I do not believe; Oriane is not exactly an eagle, but all the same she\u2019s by no means stupid.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know that, as a rule, I don\u2019t care about your advertising the good opinion you\u2019re kind enough to hold of me; I\u2019m not conceited. That\u2019s why I\u2019m sorry you should have said flattering things about me to your friends here (we will go back to them in two seconds). But Mme. de Guermantes is different; if you could let her know \u2014 if you would even exaggerate a trifle \u2014 what you think of me, you would give me great pleasure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, of course I will, if that\u2019s all you want me to do; it\u2019s not very difficult; but what difference can it possibly make to you what she thinks of you? I suppose you think her no end of a joke, really; anyhow, if that\u2019s all you want we can discuss it in front of the others or when we are by ourselves; I\u2019m afraid of your tiring yourself if you stand talking, and it\u2019s so inconvenient too, when we have heaps of opportunities of being alone together.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was precisely this inconvenience that had given me courage to approach Robert; the presence of the others was for me a pretext that justified my giving my remarks a curt and incoherent form, under cover of which I could more easily dissemble the falsehood of my saying to my friend that I had forgotten his connexion with the Duchess, and also did not give him time to frame \u2014 with regard to my reasons for wishing that Mme. de Guermantes should know that I was his friend, was clever, and so forth \u2014 questions which would have been all the more disturbing in that I should not have been able to answer them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert, I\u2019m surprised that a man of your intelligence should fail to understand that one doesn\u2019t discuss the things that will give one\u2019s friends pleasure; one does them. Now I, if you were to ask me no matter what, and indeed I only wish you would ask me to do something for you, I can assure you I shouldn\u2019t want any explanations. I may ask you for more than I really want; I have no desire to know Mme. de Guermantes, but just to test you I ought to have said that I was anxious to dine with Mme. de Guermantes; I am sure you would never have done it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot only should I have done it, I will do it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhen?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNext time I\u2019m in Paris, three weeks from now, I expect.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe shall see; I dare say she won\u2019t want to see me, though. I can\u2019t tell you how grateful I am.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all; it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t say that; it\u2019s everything in the world, because now I can see what sort of friend you are; whether what I ask you to do is important or not, disagreeable or not, whether I am really keen about it or ask you only as a test, it makes no difference; you say you will do it, and there you shew the fmeness of your mind and heart. A stupid friend would have started a discussion.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which was exactly what he had just been doing; but perhaps I wanted to flatter his self-esteem; perhaps also I was sincere, the sole touchstone of merit seeming to me to be the extent to which a friend could be useful in respect of the one thing that seemed to me to have any importance, namely my love. Then I went on, perhaps from cunning, possibly from a genuine increase of affection inspired by gratitude, expectancy, and the copy of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s very features which nature had made in producing her nephew Robert: \u201cBut, I say, we mustn\u2019t keep them waiting any longer, and I\u2019ve mentioned only one of the two things I wanted to ask you, the less important; the other is more important to me, but I\u2019m afraid you will never consent. Would it bore you if we were to call each other tu?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBore me? My dear fellow! Joy! Tears of joy! Undreamed-of happiness!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you \u2014 tu I mean; you begin first \u2014 ever so much. It is such a pleasure to me that you needn\u2019t do anything about Mme. de Guermantes if you\u2019d rather not, this is quite enough for me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can do both.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, Robert! Listen to me a minute,\u201d I said to him later while we were at dinner. \u201cOh, it\u2019s really too absurd the way our conversation is always being interrupted, I can\u2019t think why \u2014 you remember the lady I was speaking to you about just now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re quite sure you know who\u2019 I mean?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, what do you take me for, a village idiot?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t care to give me her photograph, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0had meant to ask him only for the loan of it. But when the time came to speak I felt shy, I decided that the request was indiscreet, and in order to hide my confusion I put the question more bluntly, and increased my demand, as if it had been quite natural\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; I should have to ask her permission first,\u201d was his answer\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He blushed as he spoke. I could see that he had a reservation in his mind, that he credited me also with one, that he would give only a partial service to my love, under the restraint of certain moral principles, and for this I hated him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time I was touched to see how differently Saint-Loup behaved towards me now that I was no longer alone with him, and that his friends formed an audience. His increased affability would have left me cold had I thought that it was deliberately assumed; but I could feel that it was spontaneous and consisted only of all that he had to say about me in my absence and refrained as a rule from saying when we were together by ourselves. In our private conversations I might certainly suspect the pleasure that he found in talking to me, but that pleasure he almost always left unexpressed. Now, at the same remarks from me which, as a rule, he enjoyed without shewing it, he watched from the corner of his eye to see whether they produced on his friends the effect on which he had counted, an effect corresponding to what he had promised them beforehand. The mother of a girl in her first season could be no more unrelaxing in her attention to her daughter\u2019s responses and to the attitude of the public. If I had made some remark at which, alone in my company, he would merely have smiled, he was afraid that the others might not have seen the point, and put in a \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d to make me repeat what I had said, to attract attention, and turning at once to his friends and making himself automatically, by facing them with a hearty laugh, the fugleman of their laughter, presented me for the first time with the opinion that he actually held of me and must often have expressed to them. So that I caught sight of myself suddenly from without, like a person who reads his name in a newspaper or sees himself in a mirror\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It occurred to me, one of these evenings, to tell a mildly amusing story about Mme. Blandais, but I stopped at once, remembering that Saint-Loup knew it already, and that when I had tried to tell him it on the day following my arrival he had interrupted me with: \u201cYou told me that before, at Balbec.\u201d I was surprised, therefore, to find him begging me to go on and assuring me that he did not know the story, and that it would amuse him immensely. \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten it for the moment,\u201d I said to him, \u201cbut you\u2019ll remember as I go on.\u201d \u201cNo, really; I swear you\u2019re mistaken. You\u2019ve never told me. Do go on.\u201d And throughout the story he fixed a feverish and enraptured gaze alternately on myself and on his friends. I realised only after I had finished, amid general laughter, that it had struck him that this story would give his friends a good idea of my wit, and that it was for this reason that he had pretended not to know it. Such is the stuff of friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the third evening, one of his friends, to whom I had not had an opportunity before of speaking, conversed with me at great length; and I overheard him telling Saint-Loup how much he had been enjoying himself. And indeed we sat talking together almost all evening, leaving our glasses of sauterne untouched on the table before us, isolated, sheltered from the others by the sumptuous curtains of one of those intuitive sympathies between man and man which, when they are not based upon any physical attraction, are the only kind that is altogether mysterious. Of such an enigmatic nature had seemed to me, at Balbec, that feeling which Saint-Loup had for me, which was not to be confused with the interest of our conversations, a feeling free from any material association, invisible, intangible, and yet a thing of the presence of which in himself, like a sort of inflammatory gas, he had been so far conscious as to refer to it with a smile. And yet there was perhaps something more surprising still in this sympathy born here in a single evening, like a flower that had budded and opened in a few minutes in the warmth of this little room. I could not help asking Robert when he spoke to me about Balbec whether it were really settled that he was to marry Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac. He assured me that not only was it not settled, but there had never been any thought of such a match, he had never seen her, he did not know who she was. If at that moment I had happened to see any of the social gossipers who had told me of this coming event, they would promptly have announced the betrothal of Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac to some one who was not Saint-Loup and that of Saint-Loup to some one who was not Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac. I should have surprised them greatly had I reminded them of their incompatible and still so recent predictions. In order that this little game may continue, and multiply false reports by attaching the greatest possible number to every name in turn, nature has furnished those who play it with a memory as short as their credulity is long\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup had spoken to me of another of his friends who was present also one with whom he was on particularly good terms just then, since they were the only two advocates in their mess of the retrial of Dreyfus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as a brother of this friend of Saint-Loup, who had been trained at the Schola Cantorum, thought about every new musical work not at all what his father, his mother, his cousins, his club friends thought, but exactly what the other students thought at the Schola, so this non-commissioned nobleman (of whom Bloch formed an extraordinary opinion when I told him about him, because, touched to hear that he belonged to the same party as himself, he nevertheless imagined him on account of his aristocratic birth and religious and military upbringing to be as different as possible, endowed with the same romantic attraction as a native of a distant country) had a \u2018mentality,\u2019 as people were now beginning to say, analogous to that of the whole body of Dreyfusards in general and of Bloch in particular, on which the traditions of his family and the interests of his career could retain no hold whatever. Similarly one of Saint-Loup\u2019s cousins had married a young Eastern princess who was said to write poetry quite as fine as Victor Hugo\u2019s or Alfred de Vigny\u2019s, and in spite of this was supposed to have a different type of mind from what one would naturally expect, the mind of an Eastern princess immured in an Arabian Nights palace. For the writers who had the privilege of meeting her was reserved the disappointment or rather the joy of listening to conversation which gave the impression not of Scheherazade but of a person of genius of the type of Alfred de Vigny or Victor Hugo\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat fellow? Oh, he\u2019s not like Saint-Loup, he\u2019s a regular devil,\u201d my new friend informed me; \u201che\u2019s not even straight about it. At first, he used to say: \u2018Just wait a little, there\u2019s a man I know well, a clever, kind-hearted fellow, General de Boisdeffre; you need have no hesitation in accepting his decision.\u2019 But as soon as he heard that Boisdeffre had pronounced Dreyfus guilty, Boisdeffre ceased to count: clericalism, staff prejudices, prevented his forming a candid opinion, although there is no one in the world (or was, rather, before this Dreyfus business) half so clerical as our friend. Next he told us that now we were sure to get the truth, the case had been put in the hands of Saussier, and he, a soldier of the Republic (our friend coming of an ultra-monarchist family, if you please), was a man of bronze, a stern unyielding conscience. But when Saussier pronounced Esterhazy innocent, he found fresh reasons to account for the decision, reasons damaging not to Dreyfus but to General Saussier. It was the militarist spirit that blinded Saussier (and I must explain to you that our friend is just as much militarist as clerical, or at least he was; I don\u2019t know what to think of him now). His family are all brokenhearted at seeing him possessed by such ideas.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t you think,\u201d I suggested, turning half towards Saint-Loup so as not to appear to be cutting myself off from him, as well as towards his friend, and so that we might all three join in the conversation, \u201cthat the influence we ascribe to environment is particularly true of intellectual environment. One is the man of one\u2019s idea. There are far fewer ideas than men, therefore all men with similar ideas are alike. As there is nothing material in an idea, so the people who are only materially neighbours of the man with an idea can do nothing to alter it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point I was interrupted by Saint-Loup, because another of the young men had leaned across to him with a smile and, pointing to me, exclaimed: \u201cDuroc! Duroc all over!\u201d I had no idea what this might mean, but I felt the expression on the shy young face to be more than friendly. While I was speaking, the approbation of the party seemed to Saint-Loup superfluous; he insisted on silence. And just as a conductor stops his orchestra with a rap from his baton because some one in the audience has made a noise, so he rebuked the author of this disturbance: \u201cGibergue, you must keep your mouth shut when people are speaking. You can tell us about it afterwards.\u201d And to me: \u201cPlease go on.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I gave a sigh of relief, for I had been afraid that he was going to make me begin all over again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd as an idea,\u201d I went on, \u201cis a thing that cannot participate in human interests and would be incapable of deriving any benefit from them, the men who are governed by an idea are not influenced by material considerations.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I had finished, \u201cThat\u2019s one in the eye for you, my boys,\u201d exclaimed Saint-Loup, who had been following me with his gaze with the same anxious solicitude as if I had been walking upon a tight-rope. \u201cWhat were you going to say, Gibergue?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just saying that your friend reminded me of Major Duroc. I seemed to hear him speaking.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, I\u2019ve often thought so myself,\u201d replied Saint-Loup; \u201cthey have several points in common, but you\u2019ll find there are a thousand things in this fellow that Duroc hasn\u2019t got.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup was not satisfied with this comparison. In an ecstasy of joy, into which there no doubt entered the joy that he felt in making me shine before his friends, with extreme volubility, stroking me as though he were rubbing down a horse that had just come first past the post, he reiterated: \u201cYou\u2019re the cleverest man I know, do you hear?\u201d He corrected himself, and added: \u201cYou and Elstir. \u2014 You don\u2019t mind my bracketing him with you, I hope. You understand \u2014 punctiliousness. It\u2019s like this: I say it to you as one might have said to Balzac: \u2018You are the greatest novelist of the century \u2014 you and Stendhal.\u2019 Excessive punctiliousness, don\u2019t you know, and at heart an immense admiration. No? You don\u2019t admit Stendhal?\u201d he went on, with an ingenuous confidence in my judgment which found expression in a charming, smiling, almost childish glance of interrogation from his green eyes. \u201cOh, good! I see you\u2019re on my side; Bloch can\u2019t stand Stendhal. I think it\u2019s idiotic of him. The Chartreuse is after all an immense work, don\u2019t you think? I am so glad you agree with me. What is it you like best in theChartreuse, answer me?\u201d he appealed to me with a boyish impetuosity. And the menace of his physical strength made the question almost terrifying. \u201cMosca? Fabrice?\u201d I answered timidly that Mosca reminded me a little of M. de Norpois. Whereupon peals of laughter from the young Siegfried Saint-Loup. And while I was going on to explain: \u201cBut Mosca is far more intelligent, not so pedantic,\u201d I heard Robert cry: \u201cBravo!\u201d actually clapping his hands, and, helpless with laughter, gasp: \u201cOh, perfect! Admirable! You really are astounding.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I took a particular pleasure in talking to this young man, as for that matter to all Robert\u2019s friends and to Robert himself, about their barracks, the officers of the garrison, and the army in general. Thanks to the immensely enlarged scale on which we see the things, however petty they may be, in the midst of which we eat, and talk, and lead our real life; thanks to that formidable enlargement which they undergo, and the effect of which is that the rest of the world, not being present, cannot compete with them, and assumes in comparison the unsubstantiality of a dream, I had begun to take an interest in the various personalities of the barracks, in the officers whom I saw in the square when I went to visit Saint-Loup, or, if I was awake then, when the regiment passed beneath my windows. I should have liked to know more about the major whom Saint-Loup so greatly admired, and about the course of military history which would have appealed to me \u201ceven from an aesthetic point of view.\u201d I knew that with Robert the spoken word was, only too often, a trifle hollow, but at other times implied the assimilation of valuable ideas which he was fully capable of grasping. Unfortunately, from the military point of view Robert was exclusively preoccupied at this time with the case of Dreyfus. He spoke little about it, since he alone of the party at table was a Dreyfusard; the others were violently opposed to the idea of a fresh trial, except my other neighbour, my new friend, and his opinions appeared to be somewhat vague. A firm admirer of the colonel, who was regarded as an exceptionally competent officer and had denounced the current agitation against the Army in several of his regimental orders, which won him the reputation of being an anti-Dreyfusard, my neighbour had heard that his commanding officer had let fall certain remarks which had led to the supposition that he had his doubts as to the guilt of Dreyfus and retained his admiration for Picquart. In the latter respect, at any rate, the rumour of Dreyfusism as applied to the colonel was as ill-founded as are all the rumours, springing from none knows where, which float around any great scandal. For, shortly afterwards, this colonel having been detailed to interrogate the former Chief of the Intelligence Branch, had treated him with a brutality and contempt the like of which had never been known before. However this might be (and naturally he had not taken the liberty of going direct to the colonel for his information), my neighbour had paid Saint-Loup the compliment of telling him \u2014 in the tone in which a Catholic lady might tell a Jewish lady that her parish priest denounced the pogroms in Russia and might openly admire the generosity of certain Israelites \u2014 that their colonel was not, with regard to Dreyfusism \u2014 to a certain kind of Dreyfusism, at least \u2014 the fanatical, narrow opponent that he had been made out to be\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am not surprised,\u201d was Saint-Loup\u2019s comment; \u201cfor he\u2019s a sensible man. But in spite of that he is blinded by the prejudices of his caste, and above all by his clericalism. Now,\u201d he turned to me, \u201cMajor Duroc, the lecturer on military history I was telling you about; there\u2019s a man who is whole-heartedly in support of our views, or so I\u2019m told. And I should have been surprised to hear that he wasn\u2019t, for he\u2019s not only a brilliantly clever man, but a Radical-Socialist and a freemason.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Partly out of courtesy to his friends, whom these expressions of Saint-Loup\u2019s faith in Dreyfus made uncomfortable, and also because the subject was of more interest to myself, I asked my neighbour if it were true that this major gave a demonstration of military history which had a genuine aesthetic beauty. \u201cIt is absolutely true.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut what do you mean by that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, all that you read, let us say, in the narrative of a military historian, the smallest facts, the most trivial happenings, are only the outward signs of an idea which has to be analysed, and which often brings to light other ideas, like a palimpsest. So that you have a field for study as intellectual as any science you care to name, or any art, and one that is satisfying to the mind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGive me an example or two, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is not very easy to explain,\u201d Saint-Loup broke in. \u201cYou read, let us say, that this or that Corps has tried . . . but before we go any further, the serial number of the Corps, its order of battle are not without their significance. If it is not the first time that the operation has been attempted, and if for the same operation we find a different Corps being brought up, it is perhaps a sign that the previous Corps have been wiped out or have suffered heavy casualties in the said operation; that they are no longer in a fit state to carry it through successfully. Next, we must ask ourselves what was this Corps which is now out of action; if it was composed of shock troops, held in reserve for big attacks, a fresh Corps of inferior quality will have little chance of succeeding where the first has failed. Furthermore, if we are not at the start of a campaign, this fresh Corps may itself be a composite formation of odds and ends withdrawn from other Corps, which throws a light on the strength of the forces the belligerent still has at his disposal and the proximity of the moment when his forces shall be definitely inferior to the enemy\u2019s, which gives to the operation on which this Corps is about to engage a different meaning, because, if it is no longer in a condition to make good its losses, its successes even will only help mathematically to bring it nearer to its ultimate destruction. And then, the serial number of the Corps that it has facing it is of no less significance. If, for instance, it is a much weaker unit, which has already accounted for several important units of the attacking force, the whole nature of the operation is changed, since, even if it should end in the loss of the position which the defending force has been holding, simply to have held it for any length of time may be a great success if a very small defending force has been sufficient to disable highly important forces on the other side. You can understand that if, in the analysis of the Corps engaged on both sides, there are all these points of importance, the study of the position itself, of the roads, of the railways which it commands, of the lines of communication which it protects, is of the very highest. One must study what I may call the whole geographical context,\u201d he added with a laugh. And indeed he was so delighted with this expression that, every time he employed it, even months afterwards, it was always accompanied by the same laugh. \u201cWhile the operation is being prepared by one of the belligerents, if you read that one of his patrols has been wiped out in the neighbourhood of the position by the other belligerent, one of the conclusions which you are entitled to draw is that one side was attempting to reconnoitre the defensive works with which the other intended to resist his attack. An exceptional burst of activity at a given point may indicate the desire to capture that point, but equally well the desire to hold the enemy in check there, not to retaliate at the point at which he has attacked you; or it may indeed be only a feint, intended to cover by an increased activity the relief of troops in that sector. (Which was a classic feint in Napoleon\u2019s wars.) On the other hand, to appreciate the significance of any movement, its probable object, and, as a corollary, the other movements by which it will be accompanied or followed, it is not immaterial to consult, not so much the announcements issued by the Higher Command, which may be intended to deceive the enemy, to mask a possible check, as the manual of field operations in use in the country in question. We are always entitled to assume that the manoeuvre which an army has attempted to carry out is that prescribed by the rules that are applicable to the circumstances. If, for instance, the rule lays down that a frontal attack should be accompanied by a flank attack; if, after the flank attack has failed, the Higher Command makes out that it had no connexion with the main attack and was merely a diversion, there is a strong likelihood that the truth will be found by consulting the rules and not the reports issued from Headquarters. And there are not only the regulations governing each army to be considered, but their traditions, their habits, their doctrines; the study of diplomatic activities, with their perpetual action or reaction upon military activities, must not be neglected either. Incidents apparently insignificant, which at the time are not understood, will explain to you how the enemy, counting upon a support which these incidents shew to have been withheld, was able to carry out only a part of his strategic plan. So that, if you can read between the lines of military history, what is a confused jumble for the ordinary reader becomes a chain of reasoning as straightforward as a picture is for the picture-lover who can see what the person portrayed is wearing and has in his hands, while the visitor hurrying through the gallery is bewildered by a blur of colour which gives him a headache. But just as with certain pictures, in which it is not enough to observe that the figure is holding a chalice, but one must know why the painter chose to place a chalice in his hands, what it is intended to symbolise, so these military operations, apart from their immediate object, are quite regularly traced, in the mind of the general responsible for the campaign, from the plans of earlier battles, which we may call the past experience, the literature, the learning, the etymology, the aristocracy (whichever you like) of the battles of to-day. Observe that I am not speaking for the moment of the local, the (what shall I call it?) spatial identity of battles. That exists also. A battle-field has never been, and never will be throughout the centuries, simply the ground upon which a particular battle has been fought. If it has been a battle-field, that was because it combined certain conditions of geographical position, of geological formation, drawbacks even, of a kind that would obstruct the enemy (a river, for instance, cutting his force in two), which made it a good field of battle. And so what it has been it will continue to be. A painter doesn\u2019t make a studio out of any old room; so you don\u2019t make a battle-field out of any old piece of ground. There are places set apart for the purpose. But, once again, this is not what I was telling you about; it was the type of battle which one follows, in a sort of strategic tracing, a tactical imitation, if you like. Battles like Ulm, Lodi, Leipzig, Cannae. I can\u2019t say whether there is ever going to be another war, or what nations are going to fight in it, but, if a war does come, you may be sure that it will include (and deliberately, on the commander\u2019s part) a Cannae, an Austerlitz, a Rosbach, a Waterloo. Some of our people say quite openly that Marshal von Schieffer and General Falkenhausen have prepared a Battle of Cannae against France, in the Hannibal style, pinning their enemy down along his whole front, and advancing on both flanks, especially through Belgium, while Bernhardi prefers the oblique order of Frederick the Great, Lenthen rather than Cannae. Others expound their views less crudely, but I can tell you one thing, my boy, that Beauconseil, the squadron commander I introduced you to the other day, who is an officer with a very great future before him, has swotted up a little Pratzen attack of his own; he knows it inside out, he is keeping it up his sleeve, and if he ever has an opportunity to put it into practice he will make a clean job of it and let us have it on a big scale. The break through in the centre at Rivoli, too; that\u2019s a thing that will crop up if there\u2019s ever another war. It\u2019s no more obsolete than the Iliad. I must add that we are practically condemned to make frontal attacks, because we can\u2019t afford to repeat the mistake we made in Seventy; we must assume the offensive, and nothing else. The only thing that troubles me is that if I see only the slower, more antiquated minds among us opposing this splendid doctrine, still, one of the youngest of my masters, who is a genius, I mean Mangin, would like us to leave room, provisionally of course, for the defensive. It is not very easy to answer him when he cites the example of Austerlitz, where the defence was merely a prelude to attack and victory.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The enunciation of these theories by Saint-Loup made me happy. They gave me to hope that perhaps I was not being led astray, in my life at Donci\u00e8res, with regard to these officers whom I used to hear being discussed while I sat sipping a sauterne which bathed them in its charming golden glint, by the same magnifying power which had swollen to such enormous proportions in my eyes while I was at Balbec the King and Queen of the South Sea Island, the little group of the four epicures, the young gambler, Legrandin\u2019s brother-in-law, now shrunken so in my view as to appear nonexistent. What gave me pleasure to-day would not, perhaps, leave me indifferent to-morrow, as had always happened hitherto; the creature that I still was at this moment was not, perhaps, doomed to immediate destruction since to the ardent and fugitive passion which I had felt on these few evenings for everything connected with military life, Saint-Loup, by what he had just been saying to me, touching the art of war, added an intellectual foundation, of a permanent character, capable of attaching me to itself so strongly that I might, without any attempt to deceive myself, feel assured that after I had left Donci\u00e8res I should continue to take an interest in the work of my friends there, and should not be long in coming to pay them another visit. At the same time, so as to make quite sure that this art of war was indeed an art in the true sense of the word:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou interest me \u2014 I beg your pardon, tu interest me enormously,\u201d I said to Saint-Loup, \u201cbut tell me, there is one point that puzzles me. I feel that I could be keenly thrilled by the art of strategy, but if so I must first be sure that it is not so very different from the other arts, that knowing the rules is not everything. You tell me that plans of battles are copied. I do find something aesthetic, just as you said, in seeing beneath a modern battle the plan of an older one, I can\u2019t tell you how attractive it sounds. But then, does the genius of the commander count for nothing? Does he really do no more than apply the rules? Or, in point of science, are there great generals as there are great surgeons, who, when the symptoms exhibited by two states of ill-health are identical to the outward eye, nevertheless feel, for some infinitesimal reason, founded perhaps on their experience, but interpreted afresh, that in one case they ought to do one thing, in another case another; that in one case it is better to operate, in another to wait?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should just say so! You will find Napoleon not attacking when all the rules ordered him to attack, but some obscure divination warned him not to. For instance, look at Austerlitz, or in 1806 take his instructions to Lannes. But you will find certain generals slavishly imitating one of Napoleon\u2019s movements and arriving at a diametrically opposite result. There are a dozen examples of that in 1870. But even for the interpretation of what the enemy may do, what he actually does is only a symptom which may mean any number of different things. Each of them has an equal chance of being the right thing, if one looks only to reasoning and science, just as in certain difficult cases all the medical science in the world will be powerless to decide whether the invisible tumour is malignant or not, whether or not the operation ought to be performed. It is his instinct, his divination \u2014 like Mme. de Th\u00e8bes (you follow me?)\u2014 which decides, in the great general as in the great doctor. Thus I\u2019ve been telling you, to take one instance, what might be meant by a reconnaissance on the eve of a battle. But it may mean a dozen other things also, such as to make the enemy think you are going to attack him at one point whereas you intend to attack him at another, to put out a screen which will prevent him from seeing the preparations for your real operation, to force him to bring up fresh troops, to hold them, to immobilise them in a different place from where they are needed, to form an estimate of the forces at his disposal, to feel him, to force him to shew his hand. Sometimes, indeed, the fact that you employ an immense number of troops in an operation is by no means a proof that that is your true objective; for you may be justified in carrying it out, even if it is only a feint, so that your feint may have a better chance of deceiving the enemy. If I had time now to go through the Napoleonic wars from this point of view, I assure you that these simple classic movements which we study here, and which you will come and see us practising in the field, just for the pleasure of a walk, you young rascal \u2014 no, I know you\u2019re not well, I apologise! \u2014 well, in a war, when you feel behind you the vigilance, the judgment, the profound study of the Higher Command, you are as much moved by them as by the simple lamps of a lighthouse, only a material combustion, but an emanation of the spirit, sweeping through space to warn ships of danger. I may have been wrong, perhaps, in speaking to you only of the literature of war. In reality, as the formation of the soil, the direction of wind and light tell us which way a tree will grow, so the conditions in which a campaign is fought, the features of the country through which you march, prescribe, to a certain extent, and limit the number of the plans among which the general has to choose. Which means that along a mountain range, through a system of valleys, over certain plains, it is almost with the inevitability and the tremendous beauty of an avalanche that you can forecast the line of an army on the march.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow you deny me that freedom of choice in the commander, that power of divination in the enemy who is trying to discover his plan, which you allowed me a moment ago.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all. You remember that book of philosophy we read together at Balbec, the richness of the world of possibilities compared with the real world. Very well. It is the same again with the art of strategy. In a given situation there will be four plans that offer themselves, one of which the general has to choose, as a disease may pass through various phases for which the doctor has to watch. And here again the weakness and greatness of the human elements are fresh causes of uncertainty. For of these four plans let us assume that contingent reasons (such as the attainment of minor objects, or time, which may be pressing, or the smallness of his effective strength and shortage of rations) lead the general to prefer the first, which is less perfect, but less costly also to carry out, is more rapid, and has for its terrain a richer country for feeding his troops. He may, after having begun with this plan, which the enemy, uncertain at first, will soon detect, find that success lies beyond his grasp, the difficulties being too great (that is what I call the element of human weakness), abandon it and try the second or third or fourth. But it may equally be that he has tried the first plan (and this is what I call human greatness) merely as a feint to pin down the enemy, so as to surprise him later at a point where he has not been expecting an attack. Thus at Ulm, Mack, who expected the enemy to advance from the west, was surrounded from the north where he thought he was perfectly safe. My example is not a very good one, as a matter of fact. And Ulm is a better type of enveloping battle, which the future will see reproduced, because it is not only a classic example from which generals will seek inspiration, but a form that is to some extent necessary (one of several necessities, which leaves room for choice, for variety) like a type of crystallisation. But it doesn\u2019t much matter, really, because these conditions are after all artificial. To go back to our philosophy book; it is like the rules of logic or scientific laws, reality does conform to it more or less, but bear in mind that the great mathematician Poincar\u00e9 is by no means certain that mathematics are strictly accurate. As to the rules themselves, which I mentioned to you, they are of secondary importance really, and besides they are altered from time to time. We cavalrymen, for instance, have to go by the Field Service of 1895, which, you may say, is out of date since it is based on the old and obsolete doctrine which maintains that cavalry warfare has little more than a moral effect, in the panic that the charge creates in the enemy. Whereas the more intelligent of our teachers, all the best brains in the cavalry, and particularly the major I was telling you about, anticipate on the contrary that the decisive victory will be obtained by a real hand-to-hand encounter in which our weapons will be sabre and lance and the side that can hold out longer will win, not simply morally and by creating panic, but materially.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSaint-Loup is quite right, and it is probable that the next Field Service will shew signs of this evolution,\u201d put in my other neighbour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am not ungrateful for your support, for your opinions seem to make more impression upon my friend than mine,\u201d said Saint-Loup with a smile, whether because the growing attraction between his comrade and myself annoyed him slightly or because he thought it graceful to solemnise it with this official confirmation. \u201cPerhaps I may have underestimated the importance of the rules; I don\u2019t know. They do change, that must be admitted. But in the meantime they control the military situation, the plans of campaign and concentration. If they reflect a false conception of strategy they may be the principal cause of defeat. All this is a little too technical for you,\u201d he remarked to me. \u201cAfter all, you may say that what does most to accelerate the evolution of the art of war is wars themselves. In the course of a campaign, if it is at all long, you will see one belligerent profiting by the lessons furnished him by the successes and mistakes, perfecting the methods of the other, who will improve on him in turn. But all that is a thing of the past. With the terrible advance of artillery, the wars of the future, if there are to be any more wars, will be so short that, before we have had time to think of putting our lessons into practice, peace will have been signed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t be so touchy,\u201d I told Saint-Loup, reverting to the first words ol this speech. \u201cI was listening to you quite eagerly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf you will kindly not fly into a passion, and will allow me to speak,\u201d his friend went on, \u201cI shall add to what you have just been saying that if battles copy and coincide with one another it is not merely due to the mind of the commander. It may happen that a mistake on his part (for instance, his failure to appreciate the strength of the enemy) will lead him to call upon his men for extravagant sacrifices, sacrifices which certain units will make with an abnegation so sublime that their part in the battle will be analogous to that played by some other unit in some other battle, and these will be quoted in history as interchangeable examples: to stick to 1870, we have the Prussian Guard at Saint-Privat, and the Turcos at Froeschviller and Wissembourg.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Interchangeable; very neat! Excellent! The lad has brains,\u201d was Saint-Loup\u2019s comment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was not unmoved by these last examples, as always when, beneath the particular instance, I was afforded a glimpse of the general law. Still, the genius of the commander, that was what interested me, I was anxious to discover in what it consisted, what steps, in given circumstances, when the commander who lacked genius could not withstand the enemy, the inspired leader would take to re-establish his jeopardised position, which, according to Saint-Loup, was quite possible and had been done by Napoleon more than once. And to understand what military worth meant I asked for comparisons between the various generals whom I knew by name, which of them had most markedly the character of a leader, the gifts of a tactician; at the risk of boring my new friends, who however shewed no signs of boredom, but continued to answer me with an inexhaustible good nature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt myself isolated, not only from the great, freezing night which extended far around us and in which we heard from time to time the whistle of a train which only rendered more keen the pleasure of being where we were, or the chime of an hour which, happily, was still a long way short of that at which these young men would have to buckle on their sabres and go, but also from all my external obsessions, almost from the memory of Mme. de Guermantes, by the hospitality of Saint-Loup, to which that of his friends, reinforcing it, gave, so to speak, a greater solidity; by the warmth also of this little dining-room, by the savour of the well-chosen dishes that were set before us. They gave as much pleasure to my imagination as to my appetite; sometimes the little piece of still life from which they had been taken, the rugged holy water stoup of the oyster in which lingered a few drops of brackish water, or the knotted stem, the yellow leaves of a bunch of grapes still enveloped them, inedible, poetic and remote as a landscape, and producing, at different points in the course of the meal, the impressions of rest in the shade of a vine and of an excursion out to sea; on other evenings it was the cook alone who threw into relief these original properties of our food, which he presented in its natural setting, like a work of art; and a fish cooked in wine was brought in on a long earthenware dish, on which, as it stood out in relief on a bed of bluish herbs, unbreakable now but still contorted from having been dropped alive into boiling water, surrounded by a circle of satellite creatures in their shells, crabs, shrimps and mussels, it had the appearance of being part of a ceramic design by Bernard Palissy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am jealous, furious,\u201d Saint-Loup attacked me, half smiling, half in earnest, alluding to the interminable conversations aside which I had been having with his friend. \u201cIs it because you find him more intelligent than me; do you like him better than me? Well, I suppose he\u2019s everything now, and no one else is to have a look in!\u201d Men who are enormously in love with a woman, who live in the society of woman-lovers, allow themselves pleasantries on which others, who would see less innocence in them, would never venture\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the conversation became general, they avoided any reference to Dreyfus for fear of offending Saint-Loup. The following week, however, two of his friends were remarking what a curious thing it was that, living in so military an atmosphere, he was so keen a Dreyfusard, almost an anti-militarist. \u201cThe reason is,\u201d I suggested, not wishing to enter into details, \u201cthat the influence of environment is not so important as people think . . . \u201d I intended of course to stop at this point, and not to reiterate the observations which I had made to Saint-Loup a few days earlier. Since, however, I had repeated these words almost textually, I proceeded to excuse myself by adding: \u201cAs, in fact, I was saying the other day . . . \u201d But I had reckoned without the reverse side of Robert\u2019s polite admiration of myself and certain other persons. That admiration reached its fulfilment in so entire an assimilation of their ideas that, in the course of a day or two, he would have completely forgotten that those ideas were not his own. And so, in the matter of my modest theory, Saint-Loup, for all the world as though it had always dwelt in his own brain, and as though I were merely poaching on his preserves, felt it incumbent upon him to greet my discovery with warm approval\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes; environment is of no importance.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And with as much vehemence as if he were afraid of my interrupting, or failing to understand him:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe real influence is that of one\u2019s intellectual environment! One is the man of one\u2019s idea!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He stopped for a moment, with the satisfied smile of one who has digested his dinner, dropped his eyeglass and, fixing me with a gimlet-like stare:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAll men with similar ideas are alike,\u201d he informed me, with a challenging air. Probably he had completely forgotten that I myself had said to him, only a few days earlier, what on the other hand he remembered so well\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not arrive at Saint-Loup\u2019s restaurant every evening in the same state of mind. If a memory, a sorrow that weigh on us are able to leave us so effectively that we are no longer aware of them, they can also return and sometimes remain with us for a long time. There were evenings when, as I passed through the town on my way to the restaurant, I felt so keen a longing for Mme. de Guermantes that I could scarcely breathe; you might have said that part of my breast had been cut open by a skilled anatomist, taken out, and replaced by an equal part of immaterial suffering, by an equivalent load of longing and love. And however neatly the wound may have been stitched together, there is not much comfort in life when regret for the loss of another person is substituted for one\u2019s entrails, it seems to be occupying more room than they, one feels it perpetually, and besides, what a contradiction in terms to be obliged to think a part of one\u2019s body. Only it seems that we are worth more, somehow. At the whisper of a breeze we sigh, from oppression, but from weariness also. I would look up at the sky. If it were clear, I would say to myself: \u201cPerhaps she is in the country; she is looking at the same stars; and, for all I know, when I arrive at the restaurant Robert may say to me: \u2018Good news! I have just heard from my aunt; she wants to meet you; she is coming down here.\u2019\u201d It was not in the firmament alone that I enshrined the thought of Mme. de Guermantes, A passing breath of air, more fragrant than the rest, seemed to bring me a message from her, as, long ago, from Gilberte in the cornfields of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise. We do not change; we introduce into the feeling with which we regard a person many slumbering elements which that feeling revives but which are foreign to it. Besides, with these feelings for particular people, there is always something in us that is trying to bring them nearer to the truth, that is to say, to absorb them in a more general feeling, common to the whole of humanity, with which people and the suffering that they cause us are merely a means to enable us to communicate. What brought a certain pleasure into my grief was that I knew it to be a tiny fragment of the universal love. Simply because I thought that I recognised sorrows which I had felt on Gilberte\u2019s account, or else when in the evenings at Combray Mamma would not stay in any room, and also the memory of certain pages of Bergotte, in the agony I now felt, to which Mme. de Guermantes, her coldness, her absence, were not clearly linked, as cause is to effect in the mind of a philosopher, I did not conclude that Mme. de Guermantes was not the cause of that agony. Is there not such a thing as a diffused bodily pain, extending, radiating out into other parts, which, however, it leaves, to vanish altogether, if the practitioner lays his finger on the precise spot from which it springs? And yet, until that moment, its extension gave it for us so vague, so fatal a semblance that, powerless to explain or even to locate it, we imagined that there was no possibility of its being healed. As I made my way to the restaurant I said to myself: \u201cA fortnight already since I last saw Mme. de Guermantes.\u201d A fortnight which did not appear so enormous an interval save to me, who, when Mme. de Guermantes was concerned, reckoned time by minutes. For me it was no longer the stars and the breeze merely, but the arithmetical divisions of time that assumed a dolorous and poetic aspect. Each day now was like the loose crest of a crumbling mountain, down one side of which I felt that I could descend into oblivion, but down the other was borne by the necessity of seeing the Duchess again. And I was continually inclining one way or the other, having no stable equilibrium. One day I said to myself: \u201cPerhaps there will be a letter to-night;\u201d and on entering the dining-room I found courage to ask Saint-Loup:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have had any news from Paris?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d he replied gloomily; \u201cbad news.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I breathed a sigh of relief when I realised that it was only he who was unhappy, and that the news came from his mistress. But I soon saw that one of its consequences would be to prevent Robert, for ever so long, from taking me to see his aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I learned that a quarrel had broken out between him and his mistress, through the post presumably, unless she had come down to pay him a flying visit between trains. And the quarrels, even when relatively slight, which they had previously had, had always seemed as though they must prove insoluble. For she was a girl of violent temper, who would stamp her foot and burst into tears for reasons as incomprehensible as those that make children shut themselves into dark cupboards, not come out for dinner, refuse to give any explanation, and only redouble their sobs when, our patience exhausted, we visit them with a whipping. To say that Saint-Loup suffered terribly from this estrangement would be an understatement of the truth, which would give the reader a false impression of his grief. When he found himself alone, the only picture in his mind being that of his mistress parting from him with the respect which she had felt for him at the sight of his energy, the anxieties which he had had at first gave way before the irreparable, and the cessation of an anxiety is so pleasant a thing that the rupture, once it was certain, assumed for him something of the same kind of charm as a reconciliation. What he began to suffer from, a little later, was a secondary and accidental grief, the tide of which flowed incessantly from his own heart, at the idea that perhaps she would be glad to make it up, that it was not inconceivable that she was waiting for a word from him, that in the mean time, to be avenged on him, she would perhaps on a certain evening, in a certain place, do a certain thing, and that he had only to telegraph to her that he was coming for it not to happen, that others perhaps were taking advantage of the time which he was letting slip, and that in a few days it would be too late to recapture her, for she would be already bespoke. Among all these possibilities he was certain of nothing; his mistress preserved a silence which wrought him up to such a frenzy of grief that he began to ask himself whether she might not be in hiding at Donci\u00e8res, or have sailed for the Indies\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It has been said that silence is a force; in another and widely different sense it is a tremendous force in the hands of those who are loved. It increases the anxiety of the lover who has to wait. Nothing so tempts us to approach another person as what is keeping us apart; and what barrier is there so insurmountable as silence? It has been said also that silence is a torture, capable of goading to madness him who is condemned to it in a prison cell. But what a torture \u2014 keener than that of having to keep silence \u2014 to have to endure the silence of the person one loves! Robert asked himself: \u201cWhat can she be doing, never to send me a single word, like this? She hates me, perhaps, and will always go on hating me.\u201d And he reproached himself. Thus her silence did indeed drive him mad with jealousy and remorse. Besides, more cruel than the silence of prisons, that kind of silence is in itself a prison. An immaterial enclosure, I admit, but impenetrable, this interposed slice of empty atmosphere through which, despite its emptiness, the visual rays of the abandoned lover cannot pass. Is there a more terrible illumination than that of silence which shews us not one absent love but a thousand, and shews us each of them in the act of indulging in some fresh betrayal? Sometimes, in an abrupt relaxation of his strain, Robert would imagine that this period of silence was just coming to an end, that the long expected letter was on its way. He saw it, it arrived, he started at every sound, his thirst was already quenched, he murmured: \u201cThe letter! The letter!\u201d After this glimpse of a phantom oasis of affection, he found himself once more toiling across the real desert of a silence without end\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He suffered in anticipation, without a single omission, all the griefs and pains of a rupture which at other moments he fancied he might somehow contrive to avoid, like people who put all their affairs in order with a view to a migration abroad which they never make, whose minds, no longer certain where they will find themselves living next day, flutter helplessly for the time being, detached from them, like a heart that is taken out of a dying man and continues to beat, though disjoined from the rest of his body. Anyhow, this hope that his mistress would return gave him courage to persevere in the rupture, as the belief that one will return alive from the battle helps one to face death. And inasmuch as habit is, of all the plants of human growth, the one that has least need of nutritious soil in order to live, and is the first to appear upon what is apparently the most barren rock, perhaps had he begun by effecting their rupture as a feint he would in the end have grown genuinely accustomed to it. But his uncertainty kept him in a state of emotion which, linked with the memory of the woman herself, was akin to love. He forced himself, nevertheless, not to write to her, thinking perhaps that it was a less cruel torment to live without his mistress than with her in certain conditions, or else that, after the way in which they had parted, it was necessary to wait for excuses from her, if she was to keep what he believed her to feel for him in the way, if not of love, at any rate of esteem and regard. He contented himself with going to the telephone, which had recently been installed at Donci\u00e8res, and asking for news from, or giving instructions to a lady\u2019s maid whom he had procured and placed with his friend. These communications were, as it turned out, complicated and took up much of his time, since, influenced by what her literary friends preached to her about the ugliness of the capital, but principally for the sake of her animals, her dogs, her monkey, her canaries and her parrokeet, whose incessant din her Paris landlord had declined to tolerate for another moment, Robert\u2019s mistress had now taken a little house in the neighbourhood of Versailles. Meanwhile he, down at Donci\u00e8res, no longer slept a wink all night. Once, in my room, overcome by exhaustion, he dozed off for a little. But suddenly he began to talk, tried to get up and run, to stop something from happening, said: \u201cI hear her; you shan\u2019t . . . you shan\u2019t. . . . \u201d He awoke. He had been dreaming, he explained to me, that he was in the country with the serjeant-major. His host had tried to keep him away from a certain part of the house. Saint-Loup had discovered that the serjeant-major had staying with him a subaltern, extremely rich and extremely vicious, whom he knew to have a violent passion for his mistress. And suddenly in his dream he had distinctly heard the spasmodic, regular cries which his mistress was in the habit of uttering at the moment of gratification. He had tried to force the serjeant-major to take him to the room in which she was. And the other had held him back, to keep him from going there, with an air of annoyance at such a want of discretion in a guest which, Robert said, he would never be able to forget\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt was an idiotic dream,\u201d he concluded, still quite breathless\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the same I could see that, during the hour that followed, he was more than once on the point of telephoning to his mistress to beg for a reconciliation. My father had now had the telephone for some time at home, but I doubt whether that would have been of much use to Saint-Loup. Besides, it hardly seemed to me quite proper to make my parents, or even a mechanical instrument installed in their house, play pander between Saint-Loup and his mistress, ladylike and high-minded as the latter might be. His bad dream began to fade from his memory. With a fixed and absent stare, he came to see me on each of those cruel days which traced in my mind as they followed one after the other the splendid sweep of a staircase forged in hard metal on which Robert stood asking himself what decision his friend was going to take\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At length she wrote to ask whether he would consent to forgive her. As soon as he realised that a definite rupture had been avoided he saw all the disadvantages of a reconciliation. Besides, he had already begun to suffer less acutely, and had almost accepted a grief the sharp tooth of which he would have, in a few months perhaps, to feel again if their intimacy were to be resumed. He did not hesitate for long. And perhaps he hesitated only because he was now certain of being able to recapture his mistress, of being able to do it and therefore of doing it. Only she asked him, so that she might have time to recover her equanimity, not to come to Paris at the New Year. Now he had not the heart to go to Paris without seeing her. On the other hand, she had declared her willingness to go abroad with him, bot for that he would need to make a formal application for leave, which Captain de Borodino was unwilling to grant\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sorry about it, because of your meeting with my aunt, which will have to be put off. I dare say I shall be in Paris at Easter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe shan\u2019t be able to call on Mme. de Guermantes then, because I shall have gone to Balbec. But, really, it doesn\u2019t matter in the least, I assure you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo Balbec? But you didn\u2019t go there till August.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know; but next year they\u2019re making me go there earlier, for my health.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All that he feared was that I might form a bad impression of his mistress, after what he had told me. \u201cShe is violent simply because she is too frank, too thorough in her feelings. But she is a sublime creature. You can\u2019t imagine what exquisite poetry there is in her. She goes every year to spend all Souls\u2019 Day at Bruges. \u2018Nice\u2019 of her, don\u2019t you think? If you ever do meet her you\u2019ll see what I mean; she has a greatness. . . . \u201d And, as he was infected with certain of the mannerisms used in the literary circles in which the lady moved: \u201cThere is something sidereal about her, in fact something bardic; you know what I mean, the poet merging into the priest.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was searching all through dinner for a pretext which would enable Saint-Loup to ask his aunt to see me without my having to wait until he came to Paris. Now such a pretext was furnished by the desire that I had to see some more pictures by Elstir, the famous painter whom Saint-Loup and I had met at Balbec. A pretext behind which there was, moreover, an element of truth, for if, on my visits to Elstir, what I had asked of his painting had been that it should lead me to the comprehension and love of things better than itself, a real thaw, an authentic square in a country town, live women on a beach (all the more would I have commissioned from it the portraits of the realities which I had not been able to fathom, such as a lane of hawthorn-blossoms, not so much that it might perpetuate their beauty for me as that it might reveal that beauty to me), now, on the other hand, it was the originality, the seductive attraction of those paintings that aroused my desire, and what I wanted above anything else was to look at other pictures by Elstir\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to me, also, that the least of his pictures were something quite different from the masterpieces even of greater painters than himself. His work was like a realm apart, whose frontiers were not to be passed, matchless in substance. Eagerly collecting the infrequent periodicals in which articles on him and his work had appeared, I had learned that it was only recently that he had begun to paint landscapes and still life, and that he had started with mythological subjects (I had seen photographs of two of these in his studio), and had then been for long under the influence of Japanese art\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several of the works most characteristic of his various manners were scattered about the provinces. A certain house at les Andelys, in which there was one of his finest landscapes, seemed to me as precious, gave me as keen a desire to go there and see it as did a village in the Chartres district, among whose millstone walls was enshrined a glorious painted window; and towards the possessor of this treasure, towards the man who, inside his ugly house, on the main Street, closeted like an astrologer, sat questioning one of those mirrors of the world which Elstir\u2019s pictures were, and who had perhaps bought it for many thousands of francs, I felt myself borne by that instinctive sympathy which joins the very hearts, the inmost natures of those who think alike upon a vital subject. Now three important works by my favourite painter were described in one of these articles as belonging to Mme. de Guermantes. So that it was, after all, quite sincerely that, on the evening on which Saint-Loup told me of his lady\u2019s projected visit to Bruges, I was able, during dinner, in front of his friends, to let fall, as though on the spur of the moment:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, if you don\u2019t mind. Just one last word on the subject of the lady we were speaking about. You remember Elstir, the painter I met at Balbec?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, of course I do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou remember how much I admired his work?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI do, quite well; and the letter we sent him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery well, one of the reasons \u2014 not one of the chief reasons, a subordinate reason \u2014 why I should like to meet the said lady \u2014 you do know who\u2019 I mean, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course I do. How involved you\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs that she has in her house one very fine picture, at least, by Elstir.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, I never knew that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cElstir will probably be at Balbec at Easter; you know he stays down there now all the year round, practically. I should very much like to have seen this picture before I leave Paris. I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re on sufficiently intimate terms with your aunt: but couldn\u2019t you manage, somehow, to give her so good an impression of me that she won\u2019t refuse, and then ask her if she\u2019ll let me come and see the picture without you, since you won\u2019t be there?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll answer for her; I\u2019ll make a special point of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Robert, you are an angel; I do love you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s very nice of you to love me, but it would be equally nice if you were to call me tu, as you promised, and as you began to do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope it\u2019s not your departure that you two are plotting together,\u201d one of Robert\u2019s friends said to me. \u201cYou know, if Saint-Loup does go on leave, it needn\u2019t make any difference, we shall still be here. It will be less amusing for you, perhaps, but we\u2019ll do all we can to make you forget his absence.\u201d As a matter of fact, just as we had decided that Robert\u2019s mistress would have to go to Bruges by herself, the news came that Captain de Borodino, obdurate hitherto in his refusal, had given authority for Serjeant Saint-Loup to proceed on long leave to Bruges. What had happened was this. The Prince, extremely proud of his luxuriant head of hair, was an assiduous customer of the principal hairdresser in the town, who had started life as a boy under Napoleon III\u2019s barber. Captain de Borodino was on the best of terms with the hairdresser, being, in spite of his air of majesty, quite simple in his dealings with his inferiors. But the hairdresser, through whose books the Prince\u2019s account had been running without payment for at least five years, swollen no less by bottles of Portugal and Eau des Souverains, irons, razors, and strops, than by the ordinary charges for shampooing, haircutting and the like, had a greater respect for Saint-Loup, who always paid on the nail and kept several carriages and saddle-horses. Having learned of Saint-Loup\u2019s vexation at not being able to go with his mistress, he had spoken strongly about it to the Prince at a moment when he was trussed up in a white surplice with his head held firmly over the back of the chair and his throat menaced by a razor. This narrative of a young man\u2019s gallant adventures won from the princely captain a smile of Bonapartish indulgence. It is hardly probable that he thought of his unpaid bill, but the barber\u2019s recommendation tended to put him in as good a humour as one from a duke would have put him in a bad. While his chin was still smothered in soap, the leave was promised, and the warrant was signed that evening. As for the hairdresser, who was in the habit of boasting all day long of his own exploits, and in order to do so claimed for himself, shewing an astonishing faculty for lying, distinctions that were pure fabrications, having for once rendered this signal service to Saint-Loup, not only did he refrain from publishing it broadcast, but, as if vanity were obliged to lie, and when there was no scope for lying gave place to modesty, he never mentioned the matter to Robert again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All his friends assured me that, as long as I stayed at Donci\u00e8res, or if I should come there again at any time, even although Robert were away, their horses, their quarters, their time would be at my disposal, and I felt that it was with the greatest cordiality that these young men put their comfort and youth and strength at the service of my weakness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy on earth,\u201d they went on, after insisting that I should stay, \u201cdon\u2019t you come down here every year; you see how our quiet life appeals to you! Besides you\u2019re so keen about everything that goes on in the regiment; quite the old soldier.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For I continued my eager demands that they would classify the different officers whose names I knew according to the degree of admiration which they seemed to deserve, just as, in my schooldays, I used to make the other boys classify the actors of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais. If, in the place of one of the generals whom I had always heard mentioned at the head of the list, such as Galliffet or N\u00e9grier, one of Saint-Loup\u2019s friends, with a contemptuous: \u201cBut N\u00e9grier is one of the feeblest of our general officers,\u201d put the new, intact, appetising name of Pau or Geslin de Bourgogne, I felt the same joyful surprise as long ago when the outworn name of Thiron or Febvre was sent flying by the sudden explosion of the unfamiliar name of Amaury. \u201cBetter even than N\u00e9grier? But in what respect; give me an example?\u201d I should have liked there to exist profound differences even among the junior officers of the regiment, and I hoped in the reason for these differences to seize the essential quality of what constituted military superiority. The one whom I should have been most interested to hear discussed, because he was the one whom I had most often seen, was the Prince de Borodino. But neither Saint-Loup nor his friends, if they did justice to the fine officer who kept his squadron up to the supreme pitch of efficiency, liked the man. Without speaking of him, naturally, in the same tone as of certain other officers, rankers and freemasons, who did not associate much with the rest and had, in comparison, an uncouth, barrack-room manner, they seemed not to include M. de Borodino among the officers of noble birth, from whom, it must be admitted, he differed considerably in his attitude even towards Saint-Loup. The others, taking advantage of the fact that Robert was only an N.C.O., and that therefore his influential relatives might be grateful were he invited to the houses of superior officers on whom ordinarily they would have looked down, lost no opportunity of having him to dine when any bigwig was expected who might be of use to a young cavalry serjeant. Captain de Borodino alone confined himself to his official relations (which, for that matter, were always excellent) with Robert. The fact was that the Prince, whose grandfather had been made a Marshal and a Prince-Duke by the Emperor, with whose family he had subsequently allied himself by marriage, while his father had married a cousin of Napoleon III and had twice been a Minister after the Coup d\u2019Etat, felt that in spite of all this he did not count for much with Saint-Loup and the Guermantes connexion, who in turn, since he did not look at things from the same point of view as they, counted for very little with him. He suspected that, for Saint-Loup, he himself was \u2014 he, a kinsman of the Hohenzollern \u2014 not a true noble but the grandson of a farmer, but at the same time he regarded Saint-Loup as the son of a man whose Countship had been confirmed by the Emperor \u2014 one of what were known in the Faubourg Saint-Germain as \u2018touched-up\u2019 Counts \u2014 and who had besought him first for a Prefecture, then for some other post a long way down the list of subordinates to His Highness the Prince de Borodino, Minister of State, who was styled on his letters \u2018Monseigneur\u2019 and was a nephew of the Sovereign\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Something more than a nephew, possibly. The first Princesse de Borodino was reputed to have bestowed her favours on Napoleon I, whom she followed to the Isle of Elba, and the second hers on Napoleon III. And if, in the Captain\u2019s placid countenance, one caught a trace of Napoleon I\u2014 if not in his natural features, at least in the studied majesty of the mask \u2014 the officer had, particularly in his melancholy and kindly gaze, in his drooping moustache, something that reminded one also of Napoleon III; and this in so striking a fashion that, having asked leave, after Sedan, to join the Emperor in captivity, and having been sent away by Bismarck, before whom he had been brought, the latter, happening to look up at the young man who was preparing to leave the room, was at once impressed by the likeness and, reconsidering his decision, recalled him and gave him the authorisation which he, in common with every one else, had just been refused\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Prince de Borodino was not prepared to make overtures to Saint-Loup nor to the other representatives of Faubourg Saint-Germain society that there were in the regiment (while he frequently invited two subalterns of plebeian origin who were pleasant companions) it was because, looking down upon them all from the height of his Imperial grandeur, he drew between these two classes of inferiors the distinction that one set consisted of inferiors who knew themselves to be such and with whom he was delighted to spend his time, being beneath his outward majesty of a simple, jovial humour, and the other of inferiors who thought themselves his superiors, a claim which he could not allow. And so, while all the other officers of the regiment made much of Saint-Loup, the Prince de Borodino, to whose care the young man had been recommended by Marshal X\u2014 \u2014 confined himself to being obliging with regard to the military duties which Saint-Loup always performed in the most exemplary fashion, but never had him to his house except on one special occasion when he found himself practically compelled to invite him, and when, as this occurred during my stay at Donci\u00e8res, he asked him to bring me to dinner also. I had no difficulty that evening, as I watched Saint-Loup sitting at his Captain\u2019s table, in distinguishing, in their respective manners and refinements, the difference that existed between the two aristocracies: the old nobility and that of the Empire. The offspring of a caste the faults of which, even if he repudiated them with all the force of his intellect, had been absorbed into his blood, a caste which, having ceased to exert any real authority for at least a century, saw nothing more now in the protective affability which formed part of its regular course of education, than an exercise, like horsemanship or fencing, cultivated without any serious purpose, as a sport; on meeting representatives of that middle class on which the old nobility so far looked down as to believe that they were nattered by its intimacy and would be honoured by the informality of its tone, Saint-Loup would take the hand of no matter who might be introduced to him, though he had failed perhaps to catch the stranger\u2019s name, in a friendly grip, and as he talked to him (crossing and uncrossing his legs all the time, flinging himself back in his chair in an attitude of absolute unconstraint, one foot in the palm of his hand) call him \u2018my dear fellow.\u2019 Belonging o the other hand to a nobility whose titles still preserved their original meaning, provided that their holders still possessed the splendid emoluments given in reward for glorious services and bringing to mind the record of high offices in which one is in command of numberless men and must know how to deal with men, the Prince de Borodino \u2014 not perhaps very distinctly or with any clear personal sense of superiority, but at any rate in his body, which revealed it by its attitudes and behaviour generally \u2014 regarded his own rank as a prerogative that was still effective; those same commoners whom Saint-Loup would have slapped on the shoulder and taken by the arm he addressed with a majestic affability, in which a reserve instinct with grandeur tempered the smiling good-fellowship that came naturally to him, in a tone marked at once by a genuine kindliness and a stiffness deliberately assumed. This was due, no doubt, to his being not so far removed from the great Embassies, and the Court itself, at which his father had held the highest posts, whereas the manners of Saint-Loup, the elbow on the table, the foot in the hand, would not have been well received there; but principally it was due to the fact that he looked down less upon the middle classes because they were the inexhaustible source from which the first Emperor had chosen his marshals and his nobles and in which the second had found a Rouher and a Fould\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Son, doubtless, or grandson of an Emperor, who had nothing more important to do than to command a squadron, the preoccupations of his putative father and grandfather could not, for want of an object on which to fasten themselves, survive in any real sense in the mind of M. de Borodino. But as the spirit of an artist continues to model, for many years after he is dead, the statue which he carved, so they had taken shape in him, were materialised, incarnate in him, it was they that his face reflected. It was with, in his voice, the vivacity of the first Emperor that he worded a reprimand to a corporal, with the dreamy melancholy of the second that he puffed out the smoke of a cigarette. When he passed in plain clothes through the streets of Donci\u00e8res, a certain sparkle in his eyes escaping from under the brim of the bowler hat sent radiating round this captain of cavalry a regal incognito; people trembled when he strode into the serjeant-major\u2019s office, followed by the adjutant and the quartermaster, as though by Berthier and Mass\u00e9na. When he chose the cloth for his squadron\u2019s breeches, he fastened on the master-tailor a gaze capable of baffling Talleyrand and deceiving Alexander; and at times, in the middle of an inspection, he would stop, let his handsome blue eyes cloud with dreams, twist his moustache, with the air of one building up a new Prussia and a new Italy. But a moment later, reverting from Napoleon III to Napoleon I, he would point out that the equipment was not properly polished, and would insist on tasting the men\u2019s rations. And at home, in his private life, it was for the wives of middle class officers (provided that their husbands were not freemasons) that he would bring out not only a dinner service of royal blue S\u00e8vres, fit for an Ambassador (which had been given to his father by Napoleon, and appeared even more priceless in the commonplace house on a provincial street in which he was living, like those rare porcelains which tourists admire with a special delight in the rustic china-cupboard of some old manor that has been converted into a comfortable and prosperous farmhouse), but other gifts of the Emperor also: those noble and charming manners, which too would have won admiration in some diplomatic post abroad, if, for some men, it did not mean a lifelong condemnation to the most unjust form of ostracism, merely to be well born; his easy gestures, his kindness, his grace, and, embedding beneath an enamel that was of royal blue, also glorious images, the mysterious, illuminated, living reliquary of his gaze. And, in treating of the social relations with the middle classes which the Prince had at Donci\u00e8res, it may be as well to add these few words. The lieutenant-colonel played the piano beautifully; the senior medical officer\u2019s wife sang like a Conservatoire medallist. This latter couple, as well as the lieutenant-colonel and his wife, used to dine every week with M. de Borodino. They were flattered, unquestionably, knowing that when the Prince went to Paris on leave he dined with Mme. de Pourtal\u00e8s, and the Murats, and people like that. \u201cBut,\u201d they said to themselves, \u201che\u2019s just a captain, after all; he\u2019s only too glad to get us to come. Still, he\u2019s a real friend, you know.\u201d But when M. de Borodino, who had long been pulling every possible wire to secure an appointment for himself nearer Paris, was posted to Beauvais, he packed up and went, and forgot as completely the two musical couples as he forgot the Donci\u00e8res theatre and the little restaurant to which he used often to send out for his luncheon, and, to their great indignation, neither the lieutenant-colonel nor the senior medical officer, who had so often sat at his table, ever had so much as a single word from him for the rest of their lives. One morning, Saint-Loup confessed to me that he had written to my grandmother to give her news of me, with the suggestion that, since there was telephonic connexion between Paris and Donci\u00e8res, she might make use of it to speak to me. In short, that very day she was to give me a call, and he advised me to be at the post office at about a quarter to four. The telephone was not yet at that date as commonly in use as it is to-day. And yet habit requires so short a time to divest of their mystery the sacred forces with which we are in contact, that, not having had my call at once, the only thought in my mind was that it was very slow, and badly managed, and I almost decided to lodge a complaint. Like all of us nowadays I found not rapid enough for my liking in its abrupt changes the admirable sorcery for which a few moments are enough to bring before us, invisible but present, the person to whom we have been wishing to speak, and who, while still sitting at his table, in the town in which he lives (in my grandmother\u2019s case, Paris), under another sky than ours, in weather that is not necessarily the same, in the midst of circumstances and worries of which we know nothing, but of which he is going to inform us, finds himself suddenly transported hundreds of miles (he and all the surroundings in which he remains immured) within reach of our ear, at the precise moment which our fancy has ordained. And we are like the person in the fairy-tale to whom a sorceress, on his uttering the wish, makes appear with supernatural clearness his grandmother or his betrothed in the act of turning over a book, of shedding tears, of gathering flowers, quite close to the spectator and yet ever so remote, in the place in which she actually is at the moment. We need only, so that the miracle may be accomplished, apply our lips to the magic orifice and invoke \u2014 occasionally for rather longer than seems to us necessary, I admit \u2014 the Vigilant Virgins to whose voices we listen every day without ever coming to know their faces, and who are our Guardian Angels in the dizzy realm of darkness whose portals they so jealously keep; the All Powerful by whose intervention the absent rise up at our side, without our being permitted to set eyes on them; the Danaids of the Unseen who without ceasing empty, fill, transmit the urns of sound; the ironic Furies who, just as we were murmuring a confidence to a friend, in the hope that no one was listening, cry brutally: \u201cI hear you!\u201d; the ever infuriated servants of the Mystery, the umbrageous priestesses of the Invisible, the Young Ladies of the Telephone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, the moment our call has sounded, in the night filled with phantoms to which our ears alone are unsealed, a tiny sound, an abstract sound \u2014 the sound of distance overcome \u2014 and the voice of the dear one speaks to us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is she, it is her voice that is speaking, that is there. But how remote it is! How often have I been unable to listen without anguish, as though, confronted by the impossibility of seeing, except after long hours of journeying, her whose voice has been so close to my ear, I felt more clearly the sham and illusion of meetings apparently most pleasant, and at what a distance we may be from the people we love at the moment when it seems that we have only to stretch out our hand to seize and hold them. A real presence indeed that voice so near \u2014 in actual separation. But a premonition also of an eternal separation! Over and again, as I listened in this way, without seeing her who spoke to me from so far away, it has seemed to me that the voice was crying to me from depths out of which one does not rise again, and I have known the anxiety that was one day to wring my heart when a voice should thus return (alone, and attached no longer to a body which I was never more to see), to murmur, in my ear, words I would fain have kissed as they issued from lips for ever turned to dust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This afternoon, alas, at Donci\u00e8res, the miracle did not occur. When I reached the post office, my grandmother\u2019s call had already been received; I stepped into the box; the line was engaged; some one was talking who probably did not realise that there was nobody to answer him, for when I raised the receiver to my ear, the lifeless block began squeaking like Punchinello; I silenced it, as one silences a puppet, by putting it back on its hook, but, like Punchinello, as soon as I took it again in my hand, it resumed its gabbling. At length, giving it up as hopeless, by hanging up the receiver once and for all, I stifled the convulsions of this vociferous stump which kept up its chatter until the last moment, and went in search of the operator, who told me to wait a little; then I spoke, and, after a few seconds of silence, suddenly I heard that voice which I supposed myself, mistakenly, to know so well; for always until then, every time that my grandmother had talked to me, I had been accustomed to follow what she was saying on the open score of her face, in which the eyes figured so largely; but her voice itself I was hearing this afternoon for the first time. And because that voice appeared to me to have altered in its proportions from the moment that it was a whole, and reached me in this way alone and without the accompaniment of her face and features, I discovered for the first time how sweet that voice was; perhaps, too, it had never oeen so sweet, for my grandmother, knowing me to be alone and unhappy, felt that she might let herself go in the outpouring of an affection which, on her principle of education, she usually restrained and kept hidden. It was sweet, but also how sad it was, first of all on account of its very sweetness, a sweetness drained almost \u2014 more than any but a few human voices can ever have been \u2014 of every element of resistance to others, of all selfishness; fragile by reason of its delicacy it seemed at every moment ready to break, to expire in a pure flow of tears; then, too, having it alone beside me, seen, without the mask of her face, I noticed for the first time the sorrows that had scarred it in the course of a lifetime\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it, however, solely the voice that, because it was alone, gave me this new impression which tore my heart? Not at all; it was rather that this isolation of the voice was like a symbol, a presentation, a direct consequence of another isolation, that of my grandmother, separated, for the first time in my life, from myself. The orders or prohibitions which she addressed to me at every moment in the ordinary course of my life, the tedium of obedience or the fire of rebellion which neutralised the affection that I felt for her were at this moment eliminated, and indeed might be eliminated for ever (since my grandmother no longer insisted on having me with her under her control, was in the act of expressing her hope that I would stay at Donci\u00e8res altogether, or would at any rate extend my visit for as long as possible, seeing that both my health and my work seemed likely to benefit by the change); also, what I held compressed in this little bell that was ringing in my ear was, freed from the conflicting pressures which had, every day hitherto, given it a counterpoise, and from this moment irresistible, carrying me altogether away, our mutual affection. My grandmother, by telling me to stay, filled me with an anxious, an insensate longing to return. This freedom of action which for the future she allowed me and to which I had never dreamed that she would consent, appeared to me suddenly as sad as might be my freedom of action after her death (when I should still love her and she would for ever have abandoned me). \u201cGranny!\u201d I cried to her, \u201cGranny!\u201d and would fain have kissed her, but I had beside me only that voice, a phantom, as impalpable as that which would come perhaps to revisit me when my grandmother was dead. \u201cSpeak to me!\u201d but then it happened that, left more solitary still, I ceased to catch the sound of her voice. My grandmother could no longer hear me; she was no longer in communication with me; we had ceased to stand face to face, to be audible to one another; I continued to call her, sounding the empty night, in which I felt that her appeals also must be straying. I was shaken by the same anguish which, in the distant past, I had felt once before, one day when, a little child, in a crowd, I had lost her, an anguish due less to my not finding her than to the thought that she must be searching for me, must be saying to herself that I was searching for her; an anguish comparable to that which I was to feel on the day when we speak to those who can no longer reply and whom we would so love to have hear all the things that we have not told them, and our assurance that we are not unhappy. It seemed as though it were already a beloved ghost that I had allowed to lose herself in the ghostly world, and, standing alone before the instrument, I went on vainly repeating: \u201cGranny, Granny!\u201d as Orpheus, left alone, repeats the name of his dead wife, is decided to leave the post office, to go and find Robert at his restaurant, in order to tell him that, as I was half expecting a telegram which would oblige me to return to Paris, I wished at all costs to find out at what times the trains left. And yet, before reaching this decision, I felt I must make one attempt more to invoke the Daughters of the Night, the Messengers of the Word, the Deities without form or feature; but the capricious Guardians had not deigned once again to unclose the miraculous portals, or more probably, had not been able; in vain might they untiringly appeal, as was their custom, to the venerable inventor of printing and the young prince, collector of impressionist paintings and driver of motor-cars (who was Captain de Borodino\u2019s nephew); Gutenberg and Wagram left their supplications unanswered, and I came away, feeling that the Invisible would continue to turn a deaf ear\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I came among Robert and his friends, I withheld the confession that my heart was no longer with them, that my departure was now irrevocably fixed. Saint-Loup appeared to believe me, but I learned afterwards that he had from the first moment realised that my uncertainty was feigned and that he would not see me again next day. And while, letting their plates grow cold, his friends joined him in searching through the time-table for a train which would take me to Paris, and while we heard in the cold, starry night the whistling of the engines on the line, I certainly felt no longer the same peace of mind which on all these last evenings I had derived from the friendship of the former and the latter\u2019s distant passage. And yet they did not fail me this evening, performing the same office in a different way. My departure overpowered me less when I was no longer obliged to think of it by myself, when I felt that there was concentrated on what was to be done the more normal, more wholesome activity of my strenuous friends, Robert\u2019s brothers in arms, and of those other strong creatures, the trains, whose going and coming, night and morning, between Donci\u00e8res and Paris, broke up in retrospect what had been too compact and insupportable in my long isolation from my grandmother into daily possibilities of return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t doubt the truth of what you\u2019re saying, or that you aren\u2019t thinking of leaving us just yet,\u201d said Saint-Loup, smiling; \u201cbut pretend you are going, and come and say good-bye to me to-morrow morning; early, otherwise there\u2019s a risk of my not seeing you; I\u2019m going out to luncheon, I\u2019ve got leave from the Captain; I shall have to be back in barracks by two, as we are to be on the march all afternoon. I suppose the man to whose house I\u2019m going, a couple of miles out, will manage to get me back in time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scarcely had he uttered these words when a messenger came for me from my hotel; the telephone operator had sent to find me. I ran to the post office, for it was nearly closing time. The word \u2018trunks\u2019 recurred incessantly in the answers given me by the officiais. I was in a fever of anxiety, for it was my grandmother who had asked for me. The office was closing for the night. Finally I got my connexion. \u201cIs that you, Granny?\u201d A woman\u2019s voice, with a strong English accent, answered: \u201cYes, but I don\u2019t know your voice.\u201d Neither did I recognise the voice that was speaking to me; besides, my grandmother called me tu, and not vous. And then all was explained. The young man for whom his grandmother had called on the telephone had a name almost identical with my own, and was staying in an annex of my hotel. This call coming on the very day on which I had been telephoning to my grandmother, I had never for a moment doubted that it was she who was asking for me. Whereas it was by pure coincidence that the post office and the hotel had combined to make a twofold error\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following morning I rose late, and failed to catch Saint-Loup, who had already started for the country house where he was invited to luncheon. About half past one, I had decided to go in any case to the barracks, so as to be there before he arrived, when, as I was crossing one of the avenues on the way there, I noticed, coming behind me in the same direction as myself, a tilbury which, as it overtook me, obliged me to jump out of its way; an N.C.O. was driving it, wearing an eyeglass; it was Saint-Loup. By his side was the friend whose guest he had been at luncheon, and whom I had met once before at the hotel where we dined. I did not dare shout to Robert since he was not alone, but, in the hope that he would stop and pick me up, I attracted his attention by a sweeping wave of my hat, which might be regarded as due to the presence of a stranger. I knew that Robert was short-sighted; still, I should have supposed that, provided he saw me at all, he could not fail to recognise me; he did indeed see my salute, and returned it, but without stopping; driving on at full speed, without a smile, without moving a muscle of his face, he confined himself to keeping his hand raised for a minute to the peak of his cap, as though he were acknowledging the salute of a trooper whom he did not know personally. I ran to the barracks, but it was a long way; when I arrived, the regiment was parading on the square, on which I was not allowed to stand, and I was heart-broken at not having been able to say good-bye to Saint-Loup; I went up to his room, but he had gone; I was reduced to questioning a group of sick details, recruits who had been excused route-marches, the young graduate, one of the \u2018old soldiers,\u2019 who were watching the regiment parade\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen Serjeant Saint-Loup, have you, by any chance?\u201d I asked\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s gone on parade, sir,\u201d said the old soldier\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI never saw him,\u201d said the graduate\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou never saw him,\u201d exclaimed the old soldier, losing all interest in me, \u201cyou never saw our famous Saint-Loup, the figure he\u2019s cutting with his new breeches! When the Capstan sees that, officer\u2019s cloth, my word!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, you\u2019re a wonder, you are; officer\u2019s cloth,\u201d replied the young graduate, who, reported \u2018sick in quarters,\u2019 was excused marching and tried, not without some misgivings, to be on easy terms with the veterans. \u201cThis officer\u2019s cloth you speak of is cloth like that, is it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSir?\u201d asked the old soldier angrily\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was indignant that the young graduate should throw doubt on the breeches\u2019 being made of officer\u2019s cloth, but, being a Breton, coming from a village that went by the name of Penguern-Stereden, having learned French with as much difficulty as if it had been English or German, whenever he felt himself overcome by emotion he would go on saying \u2018Sir?\u2019 to give himself time to find words, then, after this preparation, let loose his eloquence, confining himself to the repetition of certain words which he knew better than others, but without haste, taking every precaution to gloss over his unfamiliarity with the pronunciation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! It is cloth like that,\u201d he broke out, with a fury the intensity of which increased as the speed of his utterance diminished. \u201cAh! It is cloth like that; when I tell you that it is, officer\u2019s cloth, when-I-tell-you-a-thing, if-I-tell-you-a-thing, it\u2019s because I know, I should think.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery well, then;\u201d replied the young graduate, overcome by the force of this argument. \u201cKeep your hair on, old boy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere, look, there\u2019s the Capstan coming along. No, but just look at Saint-Loup; the way he throws his leg out; and his head. Would you call that a non-com? And his eyeglass; oh, he\u2019s hot stuff, he is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I asked these troopers, who did not seem at all embarrassed by my presence, whether I too might look out of the window. They neither objected to my doing so nor moved to make room for me. I saw Captain de Borodino go majestically by, putting his horse into a trot, and apparently under the illusion that he was taking part in the Battle of Austerlitz. A few loiterers had stopped by the gate to see the regiment file out. Erect on his charger, his face inclined to plumpness, his cheeks of an Imperial fulness, his eye lucid, the Prince must have been the victim of some hallucination, as I was myself whenever, after the tramway-car had passed, the silence that followed its rumble seemed to me to throb and echo with a vaguely musical palpitation. I was wretched at not having said good-bye to Saint-Loup, but I went nevertheless, for my one anxiety was to return to my grandmother; always until then, in this little country town, when I thought of what my grandmother must be doing by herself, I had pictured her as she was when with me, suppressing my own personality but without taking into account the effects of such a suppression; now, I had to free myself, at the first possible moment, in her arms, from the phantom, hitherto unsuspected and suddenly called into being by her voice, of a grandmother really separated from me, resigned, having, what I had never yet thought of her as having, a definite age, who had just received a letter from me in an empty house, as I had once before imagined Mamma in a house by herself, when I had left her to go to Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas, this phantom was just what I did see when, entering the drawing-room before my grandmother had been told of my return, I found her there, reading. I was in the room, or rather I was not yet in the room since she was not aware of my presence, and, like a woman whom one surprises at a piece of work which she will lay aside if anyone comes in, she had abandoned herself to a train of thoughts which she had never allowed to be visible by me. Of myself \u2014 thanks to that privilege which does not last but which one enjoys during the brief moment of return, the faculty of being a spectator, so to speak, of one\u2019s own absence \u2014 there was present only the witness, the observer, with a hat and travelling coat, the stranger who does not belong to the house, the photographer who has called to take a photograph of places which one will never see again. The process that mechanically occurred in my eyes when I caught sight of my grandmother was indeed a photograph. We never see the people who are dear to us save in the animated system, the perpetual motion of our incessant love for them, which before allowing the images that their faces present to reach us catches them in its vortex, flings them back upon the idea that we have always had of them, makes them adhere to it, coincide with it. How, since into the forehead, the cheeks of my grandmother I had been accustomed to read all the most delicate, the most permanent qualities of her mind; how, since every casual glance is an act of necromancy, each face that we love a mirror of the past, how could I have failed to overlook what in her had become dulled and changed, seeing that in the most trivial spectacles of our daily life, our eye, charged with thought, neglects, as would a classical tragedy, every image that does not assist the action of the play and retains only those that may help to make its purpose intelligible. But if, in place of our eye, it should be a purely material object, a photographic plate, that has watched the action, then what we shall see, in the courtyard of the Institute, for example, will be, instead of the dignified emergence of an Academician who is going to hail a cab, his staggering gait, his precautions to avoid tumbling upon his back, the parabola of his fall, as though he were drunk, or the ground frozen over. So is it when some casual sport of chance prevents our intelligent and pious affection from coming forward in time to hide from our eyes what they ought never to behold, when it is forestalled by our eyes, and they, arising first in the field and having it to themselves, set to work mechanically, like films, and shew us, in place of the loved friend who has long ago ceased to exist but whose death our affection has always hitherto kept concealed from us, the new person whom a hundred times daily that affection has clothed with a dear and cheating likeness. And, as a sick man who for long has not looked at his own reflexion, and has kept his memory of the face that he never sees refreshed from the ideal image of himself that he carries in his mind, recoils on catching sight in the glass, in the midst of an arid waste of cheek, of the sloping red structure of a nose as huge as one of the pyramids of Egypt, I, for whom my grandmother was still myself, I who had never seen her save in my own soul, always at the same place in the past, through the transparent sheets of contiguous, overlapping memories, suddenly in our drawing-room which formed part of a new world, that of time, that in which dwell the strangers of whom we say \u201cHe\u2019s begun to age a good deal,\u201d for the first time and for a moment only, since she vanished at once, I saw, sitting on the sofa, beneath the lamp, red-faced, heavy and common, sick, lost in thought, following the lines of a book with eyes that seemed hardly sane, a dejected old woman whom I did not know\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My request to be allowed to inspect the Elstirs in Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s collection had been met by Saint-Loup with: \u201cI will answer for her.\u201d And indeed, as ill luck would have it, it was he and he alone who did answer. We answer readily enough for other people when, setting our mental stage with the little puppets that represent them, we manipulate these to suit our fancy. No doubt even then we take into account the difficulties due to another person\u2019s nature being different from our own, and we do not fail to have recourse to some plan of action likely to influence that nature, an appeal to his material interest, persuasion, the rousing of emotion, which will neutralise contrary tendencies on his part. But these differences from our own nature, it is still our own nature that is imagining them, these difficulties, it is we that are raising them; these compelling motives, it is we that are applying them. And so with the actions which before our mind\u2019s eye we have made the other person rehearse, and which make him act as we choose; when we wish to see him perform them in real life, the case is altered, we come up against unseen resistances which may prove insuperable. One of the strongest is doubtless that which may be developed in a woman who is not in love with him by the disgust inspired in her, a fetid, insurmountable loathing, by the man who is in love with her; during the long weeks in which Saint-Loup still did not come to Paris, his aunt, to whom I had no doubt of his having written begging her to do so, never once asked me to call at her house to see the Elstirs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I perceived signs of coldness on the part of another occupant of the building. This was Jupien. Did he consider that I ought to have gone in and said how d\u2019ye do to him, on my return from Donci\u00e8res, before even going upstairs to our own flat? My mother said no, that there was nothing unusual about it. Fran\u00e7oise had told her that he was like that, subject to sudden fits of ill humour, without any cause. These invariably passed off after a little time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile the winter was drawing to an end. One morning, after several weeks of showers and storms, I heard in my chimney \u2014 instead of the wind, formless, elastic, sombre, which convulsed me with a longing to go to the sea \u2014 the cooing of the pigeons that were nesting in the wall outside; shimmering, unexpected, like a first hyacinth, gently tearing open its fostering heart that there might shoot forth, purple and satin-soft, its flower of sound, letting in like an opened window into my bedroom still shuttered and dark the heat, the dazzling brightness, the fatigue of a first fine day. That morning, I was surprised to find myself humming a music-hall tune which had never entered my head since the year in which I had been going to Florence and Venice. So profoundly does the atmosphere, as good days and bad recur, act on our organism and draw from dim shelves where we had forgotten them, the melodies written there which our memory rould not decipher. Presently a more conscious dreamer accompanied this musician to whom I was listening inside myself, without having recognised at first what he was playing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I quite realised that it was not for any reason peculiar to Balbec that on my arrival there I had failed to find in its church the charm which it had had for me before I knew it; that at Florence or Parma or Venice my imagination could no more take the place of my eyes when I looked at the sights there. I realised this. Similarly, one New Year\u2019s afternoon, as night fell, standing before a column of playbills, I had discovered the illusion that lies in our thinking that certain solemn holidays differ essentially from the other days in the calendar. And yet I could not prevent my memory of the time during which I had looked forward to spending Easter in Florence from continuing to make that festival the atmosphere, so to speak, of the City of Flowers, to give at once to Easter Day something Florentine and to Florence something Paschal. Easter was still a long way off; but in the range of days that stretched out before me the days of Holy Week stood out more clearly at the end of those that merely came between. Touched by a far-flung ray, like certain houses in a village which one sees from a distance when the rest are in shadow, they had caught and kept all the sun\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The weather had now become milder. And my parents themselves, by urging me to take more exercise, gave me an excuse for resuming my morning walks. I had meant to give them up, since they meant my meeting Mme. de Guermantes. But it was for this very reason that I kept thinking all the time of those walks, which led to my finding, every moment, a fresh reason for taking them, a reason that had no connexion with Mme. de Guermantes and no difficulty in convincing me that, had she never existed, I should still have taken a walk, without fail, at that hour every morning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas, if to me meeting any person other than herself would not have mattered, I felt that to her meeting anyone in the world except myself would have been endurable. It happened that, in the course of her morning walks, she received the salutations of plenty of fools whom she regarded as such. But the appearance of these in her path seemed to her, if not to hold out any promise of pleasure, to be at any rate the result of mere accident. And she stopped them at times, for there are moments in which one wants to escape from oneself, to accept the hospitality offered by the soul of another person, provided always that the other, however modest and plain it may be, is a different soul, whereas in my heart she was exasperated to feel that what she would have found was herself. And so, even when I had, for taking the same way as she, another reason than my desire to see her, I trembled like a guilty man as she came past; and sometimes, so as to neutralise anything extravagant that there might seem to have been in my overtures, I would barely acknowledge her bow, or would fasten my eyes on her face without raising my hat, and succeed only in making her angrier than ever, and begin to regard me as insolent and ill-bred besides\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was now wearing lighter, or at any rate brighter, clothes, and would come strolling down the street in which already, as though it were spring, in front of the narrow shops that were squeezed in between the huge fronts of the old aristocratic mansions, over the booths of the butter-woman and the fruit-woman and the vegetable-woman, awnings were spread to protect them from the sun. I said to myself that the woman whom I could see far off, walking, opening her sunshade, crossing the street, was, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, the greatest living exponent of the art of performing those movements and of making out of them something exquisitely lovely. Meanwhile she was advancing towards me, unconscious of this widespread reputation, her narrow, stubborn body, which had absorbed none of it, was bent stiffly forward under a scarf of violet silk; her clear, sullen eyes looked absently in front of her, and had perhaps caught sight of me; she was biting her lip; I saw her straighten her muff, give alms to a beggar, buy a bunch of violets from a flower-seller, with the same curiosity that I should have felt in watching the strokes of a great painter\u2019s brush. And when, as she reached me, she gave me a bow that was accompanied sometimes by a faint smile, it was as though she had sketched in colour for me, adding a personal inscription to myself, a drawing that was a masterpiece of art. Each of her gowns seemed to me her natural, necessary surroundings, like the projection around her of a particular aspect of her soul. On one of these Lenten mornings, when she was on her way out to luncheon, I met her wearing a gown of bright red velvet, cut slightly open at the throat. The face of Mme. de Guermantes appeared to be dreaming, beneath its pile of fair hair. I was less sad than usual because the melancholy of her expression, the sort of claustration which the startling hue of her gown set between her and the rest of the world, made her seem somehow lonely and unhappy, and this comforted me. The gown struck me as being the materialisation round about her of the scarlet rays of a heart which I did not recognise as hers and might have been able, perhaps, to console; sheltered in the mystical light of the garment with its gently flowing folds, she made me think of some Saint of the early ages of Christianity. After which I felt ashamed of afflicting with the sight of myself this holy martyr. \u201cBut, after all, the streets are public.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The streets are public, I reminded myself, giving a different meaning to the words, and marvelling that indeed in the crowded thoroughfare often soaked with rain, which made it beautiful and precious as a street sometimes is in the old towns of Italy, the Duchesse de Guermantes mingled with the public life of the world moments of her own secret life, shewing herself thus to all and sundry, jostled by every passer-by, with the splendid gratuitousness of the greatest works of art. As I had been out in the morning, after staying awake all night, in the afternoon my parents would tell me to lie down for a little and try to sleep. There is no need, when one is trying to find sleep, to give much thought to the quest, but habit is very useful, and even freedom from thought. But in these afternoon hours both were lacking. Before going to sleep, I devoted so much time to thinking that I should not be able to sleep, that even after I was asleep a little of my thought remained. It was no more than a glimmer in the almost total darkness, but it was bright enough to cast a reflexion in my sleep, first of the idea that I could not sleep, and then, a reflexion of this reflexion, that it was in my sleep that I had had the idea that I was not asleep, then, by a further refraction, my awakening . . . to a fresh doze in which I was trying to tell some friends who had come into my room that, a moment earlier, when I was asleep, I had imagined that I was not asleep. These shades were barely distinguishable; it would have required a keen \u2014 and quite useless \u2014 delicacy of perception to seize them all. Similarly, in later years, at Venice, long after the sun had set, when it seemed to be quite dark, I have seen, thanks to the echo, itself imperceptible, of a last note of light, held indefinitely on the surface of the canals, as though some optical pedal were being pressed, the reflexion of the palaces unfurled, as though for all time, in a darker velvet, on the crepuscular greyness of the water. One of my dreams was the synthesis of what my imagination had often sought to depict, in my waking hours, of a certain seagirt place and its mediaeval past. In my sleep I saw a gothic fortress rising from a sea whose waves were stilled as in a painted window. An arm of the sea cut the town in two; the green water stretched to my feet; it bathed on the opposite shore the foundations of an oriental church, and beyond it houses which existed already in the fourteenth century, so that to go across to them would have been to ascend the stream of time. This dream in which nature had learned from art, in which the sea had turned gothic, this dream in which I longed to attain, in which I believed that I was attaining to the impossible, it seemed to me that I had often dreamed it before. But as it is the property of what we imagine in our sleep to multiply itself in the past, and to appear, even when novel, familiar, I supposed that I was mistaken. I noticed, however, that I did frequently have this dream\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The limitations, too, that are common to all sleep were reflected in mine, but in a symbolical manner; I could not in the darkness make out the faces of the friends who were in the room, for we sleep with our eyes shut. I, who could carry on endless arguments with myself while I dreamed, as soon as I tried to speak to these friends felt the words stick in my throat, for we do not speak distinctly in our sleep; I wanted to go to them, and I could not move my limbs, for we do not walk when we are asleep either; and suddenly I was ashamed to be seen by them, for we sleep without our clothes. So, my eyes blinded, my lips sealed, my limbs fettered, my body naked, the figure of sleep which my sleep itself projected had the appearance of those great allegorical figures (in one of which Giotto has portrayed Envy with a serpent in her mouth) of which Swann had given me photographs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup came to Paris for a few hours only. He came with assurances that he had had no opportunity of mentioning me to his aunt. \u201cShe\u2019s not being at all nice just now, Oriane isn\u2019t,\u201d he explained, with innocent self-betrayal. \u201cShe\u2019s not my old Oriane any longer, they\u2019ve gone and changed her. I assure you, it\u2019s not worth while bothering your head about her. You pay her far too great a compliment. You wouldn\u2019t care to meet my cousin Poictiers?\u201d he went on, without stopping to reflect that this could not possibly give me any pleasure. \u201cQuite an intelligent young woman, she is; you\u2019d like her. She\u2019s married to my cousin, the Duc de Poictiers, who is a good fellow, but a bit slow for her. I\u2019ve told her about you. She said I was to bring you to see her. She\u2019s much better looking than Oriane, and younger, too. Really a nice person, don\u2019t you know, really a good sort.\u201d These were expressions recently \u2014 and all the more ardently \u2014 taken up by Robert, which meant that the person in question had a delicate nature. \u201cI don\u2019t go so far as to say she\u2019s a Dreyfusard, you must remember the sort of people she lives among; still, she did say to me: \u2018If he is innocent, how ghastly for him to be shut up on the Devil\u2019s Isle.\u2019 You see what I mean, don\u2019t you? And then she\u2019s the sort of woman who does a tremendous lot for her old governesses; she\u2019s given orders that they\u2019re never to be sent in by the servants\u2019 stair, when they come to the house. She\u2019s a very good sort, I assure you. The real reason why Oriane doesn\u2019t like her is that she feels she\u2019s the cleverer of the two.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although completely absorbed in the pity which she felt for one of the Guermantes footmen \u2014 who had no chance of going to see his girl, even when the Duchess was out, for it would immediately have been reported to her from the lodge \u2014 Fran\u00e7oise was heartbroken at not having been in the house at the moment of Saint-Loup\u2019s visit, but this was because now she herself paid visits also. She never failed to go out on the days when I most wanted her. It was always to see her brother, her niece and, more particularly, her own daughter, who had recently come to live in Paris. The intimate nature of these visits itself increased the irritation that I felt at being deprived of her services, for I had a foreboding that she would speak of them as being among those duties from which there was no dispensation, according to the laws laid down at Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so I never listened to her excuses without an ill humour which was highly unjust to her, and was brought to a climax by the way Fran\u00e7oise had of saying not: \u201cI have been to see my brother,\u201d or \u201cI have been to see my niece,\u201d but \u201cI have been to see the brother,\u201d \u201cI just looked in as I passed to bid good day to the niece\u201d (or \u201cto my niece the butcheress\u201d). As for her daughter, Fran\u00e7oise would have been glad to see her return to Combray. But this recent Parisian, making use, like a woman of fashion, of abbreviations, though hers were of a vulgar kind, protested that the week she was going shortly to spend at Combray would seem quite long enough without so much as a sight of \u201cthe Intran.\u201d She was still less willing to go to Franchise\u2019s sister, who lived in a mountainous country, for \u201cmountains,\u201d said the daughter, giving to the adjective a new and terrible meaning, \u201caren\u2019t really interesting.\u201d She could not make Up her mind to go back to M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, where \u201cthe people are so stupid,\u201d where in the market the gossips at their stalls would call cousins with her, and say \u201cWhy, it\u2019s never poor Bazireau\u2019s daughter?\u201d She would sooner die than go back and bury herself down there, now that she had \u201ctasted the life of Paris,\u201d and Fran\u00e7oise, traditionalist as she was, smiled complacently nevertheless at the spirit of innovation that was incarnate in this new Parisian when she said: \u201cVery well, mother, if you don\u2019t get your day out, you have only to send me a pneu.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The weather had turned chilly again. \u201cGo out? What for? To catch your death?\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise, who preferred to remain in the house during the week which her daughter and brother and the butcher-niece had gone to spend at Combray. Being, moreover, the last surviving adherent of the sect in whom persisted obscurely the doctrine of my aunt L\u00e9onie \u2014 a natural philosopher \u2014 Fran\u00e7oise would add, speaking of this unseasonable weather: \u201cIt is the remnant of the wrath of God!\u201d But I responded to her complaints only in a languid smile; all the more indifferent to these predictions, in that whatever befell it would be fine for me; already I could see the morning sun shine on the slope of Fiesole, I warmed myself in its rays; their strength obliged me to half open, half shut my eyelids, smiling the while, and my eyelids, like alabaster lamps, were filled with a rosy glow. It was not only the bells that came from Italy, Italy had come with them. My faithful hands would not lack flowers to honour the anniversary of the pilgrimage which I ought to have made long ago, for since, here in Paris, the weather had turned cold again as in another year at the time of our preparations for departure at the end of Lent, in the liquid, freezing air which bathed the chestnuts and planes on the boulevards, the tree in the courtyard of our house, there were already opening their petals, as in a bowl of pure water, the narcissi, the jonquils, the anemones of the Ponte Vecchio\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father had informed us that he now knew, from his friend A. J., where M. de Norpois was going when he met him about the place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s to see Mme. de Villeparisis, they are great friends; I never knew anything about it. It seems she\u2019s a delightful person, a most superior woman. You ought to go and call on her,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnother thing that surprised me very much. He spoke to me of M. de Guermantes as quite a distinguished man; I had always taken him for a boor. It seems, he knows an enormous amount, and has perfect taste, only he\u2019s very proud of his name and his connexions. But for that matter, according to Norpois, he has a tremendous position, not only here but all over Europe. It appears, the Austrian Emperor and the Tsar treat him just like one of themselves. Old Norpois told me that Mme. de Villeparisis had taken quite a fancy to you, and that you would meet all sorts of interesting people in her house. He paid a great tribute to you; you will see him if you go there, and he may have some good advice for you even if you are going to be a writer. For you\u2019re not likely to do anything else; I can see that. It might turn out quite a good career; it\u2019s not what I should have chosen for you, myself; but you\u2019ll be a man in no time now, we shan\u2019t always be here to look after you, and we mustn\u2019t prevent you from following your vocation.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If only I had been able to start writing! But whatever the conditions in which I approached the task (as, too, alas, the undertakings not to touch alcohol, to go to bed early, to sleep, to keep fit), whether it were with enthusiasm, with method, with pleasure, in depriving myself of a walk, or postponing my walk and keeping it in reserve as a reward of industry, taking advantage of an hour of good health, utilising the inactivity forced on me by a day of illness, what always emerged in the end from all my effort was a virgin page, undefiled by any writing, ineluctable as that forced card which in certain tricks one invariably is made to draw, however carefully one may first have shuffled the pack. I was merely the instrument of habits of not working, of not going to bed, of not sleeping, which must find expression somehow, cost what it might; if I offered them no resistance, if I contented myself with the pretext they seized from the first opportunity that the day afforded them of acting as they chose, I escaped without serious injury, I slept for a few hours after all, towards morning, I read a little, I did not over-exert myself; but if I attempted to thwart them, if I pretended to go to bed early, to drink only water, to work, they grew restive, they adopted strong measures, they made me really ill, I was obliged to double my dose of alcohol, did not lie down in bed for two days and nights on end, could not even read, and I vowed that another time I would be more reasonable, that is to say less wise, like the victim of an assault who allows himself to be robbed for fear, should he offer resistance, of being murdered\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father, in the meantime, had met M. de Guermantes once or twice, and, now that M. de Norpois had told him that the Duke was a remarkable man, had begun to pay more attention to what he said. As it happened, they met in the courtyard and discussed Mme. de Villeparisis. \u201cHe tells me, she\u2019s his aunt; \u2018Viparisi,\u2019 he pronounces it. He tells me, too, she\u2019s an extraordinarily able woman. In fact he said she kept a School of Wit,\u201d my father announced to us, impressed by the vagueness of this expression, which he had indeed come across now and then in volumes of memoirs, but without attaching to it any definite meaning. My mother, so great was her respect for him, when she saw that he did not dismiss as of no importance the fact that Mme. de Villeparisis kept a School of Wit, decided that this must be of some consequence. Albeit from my grandmother she had known all the time the exact amount of the Marquise\u2019s intellectual worth, it was immediately enhanced in her eyes. My grandmother, who was not very well just then, was not in favour at first of the suggested visit, and afterwards lost interest in the matter. Since we had moved into our new flat, Mme. de Villeparisis had several times asked my grandmother to call upon her. And invariably my grandmother had replied that she was not going out just at present, in one of those letters which, by a new habit of hers which we did not understand, she no longer sealed herself, but employed Fran\u00e7oise to lick the envelopes for her. As for myself, without any very clear picture in my mind of this School of Wit, I should not have been greatly surprised to find the old lady from Balbec installed behind a desk, as, for that matter, I eventually did\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father would have been glad to know, into the bargain, whether the Ambassador\u2019s support would be worth many votes to him at the Institute, for which he had thoughts of standing as an independent candidate. To tell the truth, while he did not venture to doubt that he would have M. de Norpois\u2019s support, he was by no means certain of it. He had thought it merely malicious gossip when they assured him at the Ministry that M. de Norpois, wishing to be himself the only representative there of the Institute, would put every possible obstacle in the way of my father\u2019s candidature, which besides would be particularly awkward for him at that moment, since he was supporting another candidate already. And yet, when M. Leroy-Beaulieu had first advised him to stand, and had reckoned up his chances, my father had been struck by the fact that, among the colleagues upon whom he could count for support, the eminent economist had not mentioned M. de Norpois. He dared not ask the Ambassador point-blank, but hoped that I should return from my call on Mme. de Villeparisis with his election as good as secured. This call was now imminent. That M. de Norpois would carry on propaganda calculated to assure my father the votes of at least two thirds of the Academy seemed to him all the more probable since the Ambassador\u2019s willingness to oblige was proverbial, those who liked him least admitting that no one else took such pleasure in being of service. And besides, at the Ministry, his protective influence was extended over my father far more markedly than over any other official\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father had also another encounter about this time, but one at which his extreme surprise ended in equal indignation. In the street one day he ran into Mme. Sazerat, whose life in Paris her comparative poverty restricted to occasional visits to a friend. There was no one who bored my father quite so intensely as did Mme. Sazerat, so much so that Mamma was obliged, once a year, to intercede with him in sweet and suppliant tones: \u201cMy dear, I really must invite Mme. Sazerat to the house, just once; she won\u2019t stay long;\u201d and even: \u201cListen, dear, I am going to ask you to make a great sacrifice; do go and call upon Mme. Sazerat. You know I hate bothering you, but it would be so nice of you.\u201d He would laugh, raise various objections, and go to pay the call. And so, for all that Mme. Sazerat did not appeal to him, on catching sight of her in the street my father went towards her, hat in hand; but to his profound astonishment Mme. Sazerat confined her greeting to the frigid bow enforced by politeness towards a person who is guilty of some disgraceful action or has been condemned to live, for the future, in another hemisphere. My father had come home speechless with rage. Next day my mother met Mme. Sazerat in some one\u2019s house. She did not offer my mother her hand, but only smiled at her with a vague and melancholy air as one smiles at a person with whom one used to play as a child, but with whom one has since severed all one\u2019s relations because she has led an abandoned life, has married a convict or (what is worse still) a co-respondent. Now, from all time my parents had accorded to Mme. Sazerat, and inspired in her, the most profound respect. But (and of this my mother was ignorant) Mme. Sazerat, alone of her kind at Combray, was a Dreyfusard. My father, a friend of M. M\u00e9line, was convinced that Dreyfus was guilty. He had flatly refused to listen to some of his colleagues who had asked him to sign a petition demanding a fresh trial. He never spoke to me for a week, after learning that I had chosen to take a different line. His opinions were well known. He came near to being looked upon as a Nationalist. As for my grandmother, in whom alone of the family a generous doubt was likely to be kindled, whenever anyone spoke to her of the possible innocence of Dreyfus, she gave a shake of her head, the meaning of which we did not at the time understand, but which was like the gesture of a person who has been interrupted while thinking of more serious things. My mother, torn between her love for my father and her hope that I might turn out to have brains, preserved an impartiality which she expressed by silence. Finally my grandfather, who adored the Army (albeit his duties with the National Guard had been the bugbear of his riper years), could never, at Combray, see a regiment go by the garden railings without baring his head as the colonel and the colours passed. All this was quite enough to make Mme. Sazerat, who knew every incident of the disinterested and honourable careers of my father and grandfather, regard them as pillars of Injustice. We pardon the crimes of individuals, but not their participation in a collective crime. As soon as she knew my father to be an anti-Dreyfusard she set between him and herself continents and centuries. Which explains why, across such an interval of time and space, her bow had been imperceptible to my father, and why it had not occurred to her to hold out her hand, or to say a few words which would never have carried across the worlds that lay between\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup, who was coming anyhow to Paris, had promised to take me to Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, where I hoped, though I had not said so to him, that we might meet Mme. de Guermantes. He invited me to luncheon in a restaurant with his mistress, whom we were afterwards to accompany to a rehearsal. We were to go out in the morning and call for her at her home on the outskirts of Paris\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had asked Saint-Loup that the restaurant to which we went for luncheon (in the lives of young noblemen with money to spend the restaurant plays as important a part as do bales of merchandise in Arabian stories), might, if possible, be that to which Aim\u00e9 had told me that he would be going as head waiter until the Balbec season started. It was a great attraction to me who dreamed of so many expeditions and made so few to see again some one who formed part not merely of my memories of Balbec but of Balbec itself, who went there year after year, who when ill health or my studies compelled me to stay in Paris would be watching, just the same, through the long July afternoons while he waited for the guests to come in to dinner, the sun creep down the sky and set in the sea, through the glass panels of the great dining-room, behind which, at the hour when the light died, the motionless wings of vessels, smoky blue in the distance, looked like exotic and nocturnal moths in a show-case. Himself magnetised by his contact with the strong lodestone of Balbec, this head waiter became in turn a magnet attracting me. I hoped by talking to him to get at once into communication with Balbec, to have realised here in Paris something of the delights of travel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I left the house early, with Fran\u00e7oise complaining bitterly because the footman who was engaged to be married had once again been prevented, the evening before, from going to see his girl. Fran\u00e7oise had found him in tears; he had been itching to go and strike the porter, but had restrained himself, for he valued his place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before reaching Saint-Loup\u2019s, where he was to be waiting for me at the door, I ran into Legrandin, of whom we had lost sight since our Combray days, and who, though now grown quite grey, had preserved his air of youthful candour. Seeing me, he stopped:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! So it\u2019s you,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201ca man of fashion, and in a frock coat too! That is a livery in which my independent spirit would be ill at ease. It is true that you are a man of the world, I suppose, and go out paying calls! To go and dream, as I do, before some half ruined tomb, my flowing tie and jacket are not out of place. You know how I admire the charming quality of your soul; that is why I tell you how deeply I regret that you should go forth and deny it among the Gentiles. By being capable of remaining for a moment in the nauseating atmosphere \u2014 which I am unable to breathe \u2014 of a drawing-room, you pronounce on your own future the condemnation, the damnation of the Prophet. I can see it all, you frequent the \u2018light hearts,\u2019 the houses of the great, that is the vice of our middle class to-day. Ah! Those aristocrats! The Terror was greatly to blame for not cutting the heads off every one of them. They are all sinister debauchees, when they are not simply dreary idiots. Still, my poor boy, if that sort of thing amuses you! While you are on your way to your tea-party your old friend will be more fortunate than you, for alone in an outlying suburb he will be watching the pink moon rise in a violet sky. The truth is that I scarcely belong to this Earth upon which I feel myself such an exile; it takes all the force of the law of gravity to hold me here, to keep nie from escaping into another sphere. I belong to a different planet. Goodbye; do not take amiss the old-time frankness of the peasant of the Vivonne, who has also remained a peasant of the Danube. To prove to you that I am your sincere well-wisher, I am going to send you my last novel. But you will not care for it; it is not deliquescent enough, not fin de si\u00e8cle enough for you; it is too frank, too honest; what you want is Bergotte, you have confessed it, high game for the jaded palates of pleasure-seeking epicures. I suppose I am looked upon, in your set, as an old campaigner; I do wrong to put my heart into what I write, that is no longer done; besides, the life of the people is not distinguished enough to interest your little snobbicules. Go, get you gone, try to recall at times the words of Christ: \u2018Do this and ye shall live.\u2019 Farewell, Friend.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not with any particular resentment against Legrandin that I parted from him. Certain memories are like friends in common, they can bring about reconciliations; set down amid fields starred with buttercups, upon which were piled the ruins of feudal greatness, the little wooden bridge still joined us, Legrandin and me, as it joined the two banks of the Vivonne\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After coming out of a Paris in which, although spring had begun, the trees on the boulevards had hardly put on their first leaves, it was a marvel to Saint-Loup and myself, when the circle train had set us down at the suburban village in which his mistress was living, to see every cottage garden gay with huge festal altars of fruit trees in blossom. It was like one of those peculiar, poetical, ephemeral, local festivals which people travel long distances to attend on certain fixed occasions, only this one was held by Nature. The bloom of the cherry tree is stuck so close to its branches, like a white sheath, that from a distance, among the other trees that shewed as yet scarcely a flower or leaf, one might have taken it, on this day of sunshine that was still so cold, for snow, melted everywhere else, which still clung to the bushes. But the tall pear trees enveloped each house, each modest courtyard in a whiteness more vast, more uniform, more dazzling, as if all the dwellings, all the enclosed spaces in the village were on their way to make, on one solemn date, their first communion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It had been a country village, and had kept its old mayor\u2019s office sunburned and brown, in front of which, in the place of maypoles and streamers, three tall pear trees were, as though for some civic and local festival, gallantly beflagged with white satin. These villages in the environs of Paris still have at their gates parks of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which were the \u2018follies\u2019 of the stewards and favourites of the great. A fruit-grower had utilised one of these which was sunk below the road for his trees, or had simply, perhaps, preserved the plan of an immense orchard of former days. Laid out in quincunxes, these pear trees, less crowded and not so far on as those that I had seen, formed great quadrilaterals \u2014 separated by low walls \u2014 of snowy blossom, on each side of which the light fell differently, so that all these airy roofless chambers seemed to belong to a Palace of the Sun, such as one might unearth in Crete or somewhere; and made one think also of the different ponds of a reservoir, or of those parts of the sea which man, for some fishery, or to plant oyster-beds, has subdivided, when one saw, varying with the orientation of the boughs, the light fall and play upon their trained arms as upon water warm with spring, and coax into unfolding here and there, gleaming amid the open, azure-panelled trellis of the branches, the foaming whiteness of a creamy, sunlit flower\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Never had Robert spoken to me so tenderly of his friend as he did during this walk. She alone had taken root in his heart; his future career in the Army, his position in society, his family, he was not, of course, indifferent altogether to these, but they were of no account compared with the veriest trifle that concerned his mistress. That alone had any importance in his eyes, infinitely more importance than the Guermantes and all the kings of the earth put together. I do not know whether he had formulated the doctrine that she was of a superior quality to anyone else, but I do know that he considered, took trouble only about what affected her. Through her and for her he was capable of suffering, of being happy, perhaps of doing murder. There was really nothing that interested, that could excite him except what his mistress wished, was going to do, what was going on, discernible at most in fleeting changes of expression, in the narrow expanse of her face and behind her privileged brow. So nice-minded in all else, he looked forward to the prospect of a brilliant marriage, solely in order to be able to continue to maintain her, to keep her always. If one had asked oneself what was the value that he set on her, I doubt whether one could ever have imagined a figure high enough. If he did not marry her, it was because a practical instinct warned him that as soon as she had nothing more to expect from him she would leave him, or would at least live as she chose, and that he must retain his hold on her by keeping her in suspense from day to day. For he admitted the possibility that she did not love him. No doubt the general affection called love must have forced him \u2014 as it forces all men \u2014 to believe at times that she did. But in his heart of hearts he felt that this love which she felt for him did not exhaust the possibility of her remaining with him only on account of his money, and that on the day when she had nothing more to expect from him she would make haste (the dupe of her friends and their literary theories, and loving him all the time, really \u2014 he thought) to leave him. \u201cIf she is nice to me to-day,\u201d he confided to me, \u201cI am going to give her something that she\u2019ll like. It\u2019s a necklace she saw at Boucheron\u2019s. It\u2019s rather too much for me just at present \u2014 thirty thousand francs. But, poor puss, she gets so little pleasure out of life. She will be jolly pleased with it, I know. She mentioned it to me and told me she knew somebody who would perhaps give it to her. I don t believe that is true, really, but I wasn\u2019t taking any risks, so I\u2019ve arranged with Boucheron, who is our family jeweller, to keep it for me. I am glad to think that you\u2019re going to meet her; she\u2019s nothing so very wonderful to look at, you know,\u201d (I could see that he thought just the opposite and had said this only so as to make me, when I did see her, admire her all the more) \u201cwhat she has got is a marvellous judgment; she\u2019ll perhaps be afraid to talk much before you, but, by Jove! the things she\u2019ll say to me about you afterwards, you know she says things one can go on thinking about for hours; there\u2019s really something about her that\u2019s quite Pythian.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On our way to her house we passed by a row of little gardens, and I was obliged to stop, for they were all aflower with pear and cherry blossoms; as empty, no doubt, and lifeless only yesterday as a house that no tenant has taken, they were suddenly peopled and adorned by these newcomers, arrived during the night, whose lovely white garments we could see through the railings along the garden paths\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen; I can see you\u2019d rather stop and look at that stuff, and grow poetical about it,\u201d said Robert, \u201cso just wait for me here, will you; my friend\u2019s house is quite close, I will go and fetch her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I waited I strolled up and down the road, past these modest gardens. If I raised my head I could see, now and then, girls sitting in the windows, but outside, in the open air, and at the height of a half-landing, here and there, light and pliant, in their fresh pink gowns, hanging among the leaves, young lilac-clusters were letting themselves be swung by the breeze without heeding the passer-by who was turning his eyes towards their green mansions. I recognised in them the platoons in violet uniform posted at the entrance to M. Swann\u2019s park, past the little white fence, in the warm afternoons of spring, like an enchanting rustic tapestry. I took a path which led me into a meadow. A cold wind blew keenly along it, as at Combray, but from the midst of the rich, moist, country soil, which might have been on the bank of the Vivonne, there had nevertheless arisen, punctual at the trysting place like all its band of brothers, a great white pear tree which waved smilingly in the sun\u2019s face, like a curtain of light materialised and made palpable, its flowers shaken by the breeze but polished and frosted with silver by the sun\u2019s rays\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly Saint-Loup appeared, accompanied by his mistress, and then, in this woman who was for him all the love, every possible delight in life, whose personality, mysteriously enshrined in a body as in a Tabernacle, was the object that still occupied incessantly the toiling imagination of my friend, whom he felt that he would never really know, as to whom he was perpetually asking himself what could be her secret self, behind the veil of eyes and flesh, in this woman I recognised at once \u2018Rachel when from the Lord,\u2019 her who, but a few years since \u2014 women change their position so rapidly in that world, when they do change \u2014 used to say to the procuress: \u201cTo-morrow evening, then, if you want me for anyone, you will send round, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And when they had \u2018come round\u2019 for her, and she found herself alone in the room with the \u2018anyone,\u2019 she had known so well what was required of her that after locking the door, as a prudent woman\u2019s precaution or a ritual gesture, she would begin to take off all her things, as one does before the doctor who is going to sound one\u2019s chest, never stopping in the process unless the \u2018some one,\u2019 not caring for nudity, told her that she might keep on her shift, as specialists do sometimes who, having an extremely fine ear and being afraid of their patient\u2019s catching a chill, are satisfied with listening to his breathing and the beating of his heart through his shirt. On this woman whose whole life, all her thoughts, all her past, all the men who at one time or another had had her were to me so utterly unimportant that if she had begun to tell me about them I should have listened to her only out of politeness, and should barely have heard what she said, I felt that the anxiety, the torment, the love of Saint-Loup had been concentrated in such a way as to make \u2014 out of what was for me a mechanical toy, nothing more \u2014 the cause of endless suffering, the very object and reward of existence. Seeing these two elements separately (because I had known \u2018Rachel when from the Lord\u2019 in a house of ill fame), I realised that many women for the sake of whom men live, suffer, take their lives, may be in themselves or for other people what Rachel was for me. The idea that any one could be tormented by curiosity with regard to her life stupefied me. I could have told Robert of any number of her unchastities, which seemed to me the most uninteresting things in the world. And how they would have pained him! And what had he not given to learn them, without avail!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I realised also then all that the human imagination can put behind a little scrap of face, such as this girl\u2019s face was, if it is the imagination that was the first to know it; and conversely into what wretched elements, crudely material and utterly without value, might be decomposed what had been the inspiration of countless dreams if, on the contrary, it should be so to speak controverted by the slightest actual acquaintance. I saw that what had appeared to me to be not worth twenty francs when it had been offered to me for twenty francs in the house of ill fame, where it was then for me simply a woman desirous of earning twenty francs, might be worth more than a million, more than one\u2019s family, more than all the most coveted positions in life if one had begun by imagining her to embody a strange creature, interesting to know, difficult to seize and to hold. No doubt it was the same thin and narrow face that we saw, Robert and I. But we had arrived at it by two opposite ways, between which there was no communication, and we should never both see it from the same side. That face, with its stares, its smiles, the movements of its lips, I had known from outside as being simply that of a woman of the sort who for twenty francs would do anything that I asked. And so her stares, her smiles, the movements of her lips had seemed to me significant merely of the general actions of a class without any distinctive quality. And beneath them I should not have had the curiosity to look for a person. But what to me had in a sense been offered at the start, that consenting face, had been for Robert an ultimate goal towards which he had made his way through endless hopes and doubts, suspicions, dreams. He gave more than a million francs in order to have for himself, in order that there might not be offered to others what had been offered to me, as to all and sundry, for a score. That he too should not have enjoyed it at the lower price may have been due to the chance of a moment, the instant in which she who seemed ready to yield herself makes off, having perhaps an assignation elsewhere, some reason which makes her more difficult of access that day. Should the man be a sentimentalist, then, even if she has not observed it, but infinitely more if she has, the direst game begins. Unable to swallow his disappointment, to make himself forget about the woman, he starts afresh in pursuit, she flies him, until a mere smile for which he no longer ventured to hope is bought at a thousand times what should have been the price of the last, the most intimate favours. It happens even at times in such a case, when one has been led by a mixture of simplicity in one\u2019s judgment and cowardice in the face of suffering to commit the crowning folly of making an inaccessible idol of a girl, that these last favours, or even the first kiss one is fated never to obtain, one no longer even ventures to ask for them for fear of destroying one\u2019s chances of Platonic love. And it is then a bitter anguish to leave the world without having ever known what were the embraces of the woman one has most passionately loved. As for Rachel\u2019s favours, however, Saint-Loup had by mere accident succeeded in winning them all. Certainly if he had now learned that they had been offered to all the world for a louis, he would have suffered, of course, acutely, but would still have given a million francs for the right to keep them, for nothing that he might have learned could have made him emerge \u2014 since that is beyond human control and can be brought to pass only in spite of it by the action of some great natural law \u2014 from the path he was treading, from which that face could appear to him only through the web of the dreams that he had already spun. The immobility of that thin face, like that of a sheet of paper subjected to the colossal pressure of two atmospheres, seemed to me to be being maintained by two infinities which abutted on her without meeting, for she held them apart. And indeed, when Robert and I were both looking at her we did not both see her from the same side of the mystery\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not \u2018Rachel when from the Lord\u2019\u2014 who seemed to me a small matter \u2014 it was the power of the human imagination, the illusion on which were based the pains of love; these I felt to be vast. Robert noticed that I appeared moved. I turned my eyes to the pear and cherry trees of the garden opposite, so that he might think that it was their beauty that had touched me. And it did touch me in somewhat the same way; it also brought close to me things of the kind which we not only see with our eyes but feel also in our hearts. These trees that I had seen in the garden, likening them in my mind to strange deities, had not my mistake been like the Magdalene\u2019s when, in another garden, she saw a human form and \u2018thought it was the gardener.\u2019 Treasurers of our memories of the age of gold, keepers of the promise that reality is not what we suppose, that the splendour of Poetry, the wonderful radiance of innocence may shine in it and may be the recompense which we strive to earn, these great white creatures, bowed in a marvellous fashion above the shade propitious for rest, for angling or for reading, were they not rather angels? I exchanged a few words with Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress. We cut across the village. Its houses were sordid. But by each of the most wretched, of those that looked as though they had been scorched and branded by a rain of brimstone, a mysterious traveller, halting for a day in the accursed city, a resplendent angel stood erect, extending broadly over it the dazzling protection of the wings of flowering innocence: it was a pear tree. Saint-Loup drew me a little way in front to explain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should have liked it if you and I could have been alone together, in fact I would much rather have had luncheon just with you, and stayed with you until it was time to go to my aunt\u2019s. But this poor girl of mine here, it is such a pleasure to her, and she is so decent to me, don\u2019t you know, I hadn\u2019t the heart to refuse her. You\u2019ll like her, however, she\u2019s literary, you know, a most sensitive nature, and besides it\u2019s such a pleasure to be with her in a restaurant, she is so charming, so simple, always delighted with every, thing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I fancy nevertheless that, on this same morning, and then probably for the first and last time, Robert did detach himself for a moment from the woman whom out of successive layers of affection he had gradually created, and beheld suddenly at some distance from himself another Rachel, outwardly the double of his but entirely different, who was nothing more or less than a little light of love. We had left the blossoming orchard and were making for the train which was to take us to Paris when, at the station, Rachel, who was walking by herself, was recognised and accosted by a pair of common little \u2018tarts\u2019 like herself, who first of all, thinking that she was alone, called out: \u201cHello, Rachel, you come with us; Lucienne and Germaine are in the train, and there\u2019s room for one more. Come on. We\u2019re all going to the rink,\u201d and were just going to introduce to her two counter-jumpers, their lovers, who were escorting them, when, noticing that she seemed a little uneasy, they looked up and beyond her, caught sight of us, and with apologies bade her a good-bye to which she responded in a somewhat embarrassed, but still friendly tone. They were two poor little \u2018tarts\u2019 with collars of sham otter skin, looking more or less as Rachel must have looked when Saint-Loup first met her. He did not know them, or their names even, and seeing that they appeared to be extremely intimate with his mistress he could not help wondering whether she too might not once have had, had not still perhaps her place in a life of which he had never dreamed, utterly different from the life she led with him, a life in which one had women for a louis apiece, whereas he was giving more than a hundred thousand francs a year to Rachel, He caught only a fleeting glimpse of that life, but saw also in the thick of it a Rachel other than her whom he knew, a Rachel like the two little \u2018tarts\u2019 in the train, a twenty-franc Rachel. In short, Rachel had for the moment duplicated herself in his eyes, he had seen, at some distance from his own Rachel, the little \u2018tart\u2019 Rachel, the real Rachel, assuming that Rachel the \u2018tart\u2019 was more real than the other. It may then have occurred to Robert that from the hell in which he was living, with the prospect of a rich marriage, of the sale of his name, to enable him to go on giving Rachel a hundred thousand francs every year, he might easily perhaps have escaped, and have enjoyed the favours of his mistress, as the two counter-jumpers enjoyed those of their girls, for next to nothing. But how was it to be done? She had done nothing to forfeit his regard. Less generously rewarded she would be less kind to him, would stop saying and writing the things that so deeply moved him> things which he would quote, with a touch of ostentation, to his friends, taking care to point out how nice it was of her to say them, but omitting to mention that he was maintaining her in the most lavish fashion, or even that he ever gave her anything at all, that these inscriptions on photographs, or greetings at the end of telegrams were but the conversion into the most exiguous, the most precious of currencies of a hundred thousand francs. If he took care not to admit that these rare kindnesses on Rachel\u2019s part were handsomely paid for by himself, it would be wrong to say \u2014 and yet, by a crude piece of reasoning, we do say it, absurdly, of every lover who pays in cash for his pleasure, and of a great many husbands \u2014 that this was from self-esteem or vanity. Saint-Loup had enough sense to perceive that all the pleasures which appeal to vanity he could have found easily and without cost to himself in society, on the strength of his historic name and handsome face, and that his connexion with Rachel had rather, if anything, tended to ostracise him, led to his being less sought after. No; this self-esteem which seeks to appear to be receiving gratuitously the outward signs of the affection of her whom one loves is simply a consequence of love, the need to figure in one\u2019s own eyes and in other people\u2019s as loved in return by the person whom one loves so well. Rachel rejoined us, leaving the two \u2018tarts\u2019 to get into their compartment; but, no less than their sham otter skins and the self-conscious appearance of their young men, the names Lucienne and Germaine kept the new Rachel alive for a moment longer. For a moment Robert imagined a Place Pigalle existence with unknown associates, sordid love affairs, afternoons spent in simple amusements, excursions or pleasure-parties, in that Paris in which the sunny brightness of the streets from the Boulevard de Clichy onwards did not seem the same as the solar radiance in which he himself strolled with his mistress, but must be something different, for love, and suffering which is one with love, have, like intoxication, the power to alter for us inanimate things. It was almost an unknown Paris in the heart of Paris itself that he suspected, his connexion appeared to him like the exploration of a strange form of life, for if when with him Rachel was somewhat similar to himself, it was nevertheless a part of her real life that she lived with him, indeed the most precious part, in view of his reckless expenditure on her, the part that made her so greatly envied by her friends and would enable her one day to retire to the country or to establish herself in the leading theatres, when she had made her pile. Robert longed to ask her who Lucienne and Germaine were, what they would have said to her if she had joined them in their compartment, how they would all have spent a day which would have perhaps ended, as a supreme diversion, after the pleasures of the rink, at the Olympia Tavern, if Robert and I had not been there. For a moment the purlieus of the Olympia, which until then had seemed to him merely deadly dull, aroused curiosity in him and pain, and the sunshine of this spring day beating upon the Rue Caumartin where, possibly, if she had not known Robert, Rachel might have gone in the course of the evening and nave earned a louis, filled him with a vague longing. But what use was it to ply Rachel with questions when he already knew that her answer would be merely silence, or a lie, or something extremely painful for him to hear, which would yet explain nothing. The porters were shutting the doors; we jumped into a first-class carriage; Rachel\u2019s magnificent pearls reminded Robert that she was a woman of great price, he caressed her, restored her to her place in his heart where he could contemplate her, internalised, as he had always done hitherto \u2014 save during this brief instant in which he had seen her in the Place Pigalle of an impressionist painter \u2014 and the train began to move\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was, by the way, quite true that she was \u2018literary.\u2019 She never stopped talking to me about books, new art and Tolstoyism except to rebuke Saint-Loup for drinking so much wine:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! If you could live with me for a year, we\u2019d see a fine change. I should keep you on water and you\u2019d be ever so much better.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRight you are. Let\u2019s begin now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut you know quite well I have to work all day!\u201d For she took her art very seriously. \u201cBesides, what would your people say?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she began to abuse his family to me in terms which for that matter seemed to me highly reasonable, and with which Saint-Loup, while disobeying her orders in the matter of champagne, entirely concurred. I, who was so much afraid of the effect of wine on him, and felt the good influence of his mistress, was quite prepared to advise him to let his family go hang. Tears sprang to the young woman\u2019s eyes; I had been rash enough to refer to Dreyfus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe poor martyr!\u201d she almost sobbed; \u201cit will be the death of him in that dreadful place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t upset yourself, Z\u00e9zette, he will come back, he will be acquitted all right, they will admit they\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut long before then he\u2019ll be dead! Oh, well at any rate his children will bear a stainless name. But just think of the agony he must be going through; that\u2019s what makes my heart bleed. And would you believe that Robert\u2019s mother, a pious woman, says that he ought to be left on the Devil\u2019s Isle, even if he is innocent; isn\u2019t it appalling?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, it\u2019s absolutely true, she does say that,\u201d Robert assured me. \u201cShe\u2019s my mother, I\u2019ve no fault to find with her, but it\u2019s quite clear she hasn\u2019t got a sensitive nature, like Z\u00e9zette.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact these luncheons which were said to be \u2018such a pleasure\u2019 always ended in trouble. For as soon as Saint-Loup found himself in a public place with his mistress, he would imagine that she was looking at every other man in the room, and his brow would darken; she would remark his ill-humour, which she may have thought it amusing to encourage, or, as was more probable, by a foolish piece of conceit preferred, feeling wounded by his tone, not to appear to be seeking to disarm; and would make a show of being unable to take her eyes off some man or other, not that this was always a mere pretence. In fact, the gentleman who, in theatre or caf\u00e9, happened to sit next to them, or, to go no farther, the driver of the cab they had engaged need only have something attractive about him, no matter what, and Robert, his perception quickened by jealousy, would have noticed it before his mistress; he would see in him immediately one of those foul creatures whom he had denounced to me at Balbec, who corrupted and dishonoured women for their own amusement, would beg his mistress to take her eyes off the man, thereby drawing her attention to him. And sometimes she found that Robert had shewn such good judgment in his suspicion that after a little she even left off teasing him in order that he might calm down and consent to go off by himself on some errand which would give her time to begin conversation with the stranger, often to make an assignation, sometimes even to bring matters quickly to a head. I could see as soon as we entered the restaurant that Robert was looking troubled. The fact of the matter was that he had at once remarked, what had escaped our notice at Balbec, namely that, standing among his coarser colleagues, Aim\u00e9, with a modest brilliance, emitted, quite unconsciously of course, that air of romance which emanates until a certain period in life from fine hair and a Grecian nose, features thanks to which he was distinguishable among the crowd of waiters. The others, almost all of them well on in years, presented a series of types, extraordinarily ugly and criminal, of hypocritical priests, sanctimonious confessors, more numerously of comic actors of the old school, whose sugar-loaf foreheads are scarcely to be seen nowadays outside the collections of portraits that hang in the humbly historic green-rooms of little, out of date theatres, where they are represented in the parts of servants or high priests, though this restaurant seemed, thanks to a selective method of recruiting and perhaps to some system of hereditary nomination, to have preserved their solemn type in a sort of College of Augurs. As ill luck would have it, Aim\u00e9 having recognised us, it was he who came to take our order, while the procession of operatic high priests swept past us to other tables. Aim\u00e9 inquired after my grandmother\u2019s health; I asked for news of his wife and children. He gave it with emotion, being a family man. He had an intelligent, vigorous, but respectful air. Robert\u2019s mistress began to gaze at him with a strange attentiveness. But Aim\u00e9\u2018s sunken eyes, in which a slight short-sightedness gave one the impression of veiled depths, shewed no sign of consciousness in his still face. In the provincial hotel in which he had served for many years before coming to Balbec, the charming sketch, now a trifle discoloured and faded, which was his face, and which, for all those years, like some engraved portrait of Prince Eug\u00e8ne, had been visible always at the same place, at the far end of a dining-room that was almost always empty, could not have attracted any very curious gaze. He had thus for long remained, doubtless for want of sympathetic admirers, in ignorance of the artistic value of his face, and but little inclined for that matter to draw attention to it, for he was temperamentally cold. At the most, some passing Parisian, stopping for some reason in the town, had raised her eyes to his, had asked him perhaps to bring something to her in her room before she left for the station, and in the pellucid, Monotonous, deep void of this existence of a faithful husband and servant in a country town had hidden the secret of a caprice without sequel which no one would ever bring to light. And yet Aim\u00e9 must have been conscious of the insistent emphasis with which the eyes of the young actress were fastened upon him now. Anyhow, it did not escape Robert beneath whose skin I saw gathering a flush, not vivid like that which burned his cheeks when he felt any sudden emotion, but faint, diffused\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnything specially interesting about that waiter, Z\u00e9zette?\u201d he inquired, after sharply dismissing Aim\u00e9. \u201cOne would think you were studying the part.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere you are, beginning again; I knew it was coming.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBeginning what again, my dear girl? I may have been mistaken; I haven\u2019t said anything, I\u2019m sure. But I have at least the right to warn you against the fellow, seeing that I knew him at Balbec (otherwise I shouldn\u2019t give a damn), and a bigger scoundrel doesn\u2019t walk the face of the earth.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She seemed anxious to pacify Robert and began to engage me in a literary conversation in which he joined. I found that it did not bore me to talk to her, for she had a thorough knowledge of the books that I most admired, and her opinion of them agreed more or less with my own; but as I had heard Mme. de Villeparisis declare that she had no talent, I attached but little importance to this evidence of culture. She discoursed wittily on all manner of topics, and would have been genuinely entertaining had she not affected to an irritating extent the jargon of the sets and studios. She applied this, moreover, to everything under the sun; for instance, having acquired the habit of saying of a picture, if it were impressionist, or an opera, if Wagnerian, \u201cAh! That is good!\u201d one day when a young man had kissed her on the ear, and, touched by her pretence of being thrilled, had affected modesty, she said: \u201cYes, as a sensation I call it distinctly good.\u201d But what more surprised me was that the expressions peculiar to Robert (which, moreover, had come to him, perhaps, from literary men whom she knew) were used by her to him and by him to her as though they had been a necessary form of speech, and without any conception of the pointlessness of an originality that is universal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In eating, she managed her hands so clumsily that one assumed that she must appear extremely awkward upon the stage. She recovered her dexterity only when making love, with that touching prescience latent in women who love the male body so intensely that they immediately guess what will give most pleasure to that body, which is yet so different from their own\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I ceased to take part in the conversation when it turned upon the theatre, for on that topic Rachel was too malicious for my liking. She did, it was true, take up in a tone of commiseration \u2014 against Saint-Loup, which proved that he was accustomed to hearing Rachel attack her \u2014 the defence of Berma, saying: \u201cOh, no, she\u2019s a wonderful person, really. Of course, the things she does no longer appeal to us, they don\u2019t correspond quite to what we are looking for, but one must think of her at the period to which she belongs; we owe her a great deal. She has done good work, you know. And besides she\u2019s such a fine woman, she has such a good heart; naturally she doesn\u2019t care about the things that interest us, but she has had in her time, with a rather impressive face, a charming quality of mind.\u201d (Our ringers, by the way, do not play the same accompaniment to all our aesthetic judgments. If it is a picture that is under discussion, to shew that it is a fine work with plenty of paint, it is enough to stick out one\u2019s thumb. But the \u2018charming quality of mind\u2019 is more exacting. It requires two fingers, or rather two fingernails, as though one were trying to flick off a particle of dust.) But, with this single exception, Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress referred to the best-known actresses in a tone of ironical superiority which annoyed me because I believed \u2014 quite mistakenly, as it happened \u2014 that it was she who was inferior to them. She was clearly aware that I must regard her as an indifferent actress, and on the other hand have a great regard for those she despised. But she shewed no resentment, because there is in all great talent while it is still, as hers was then, unrecognised, however sure it may be of itself, a vein of humility, and because we make the consideration that we expect from others proportionate not to our latent powers but to the position to which we have attained. (I was, an hour or so later, at the theatre, to see Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress shew great deference towards those very artists against whom she was now bringing so harsh a judgment to bear.) And so, in however little doubt my silence may have left her, she insisted nevertheless on our dining together that evening, assuring me that never had anyone\u2019s conversation delighted her so much as mine. If we were not yet in the theatre, to which we were to go after luncheon, we had the sense of being in a green-room hung with portraits of old members of the company, so markedly were the waiters\u2019 faces those which, one thought, had perished with a whole generation of obscure actors of the Palais-Royal; they had a look, also, of Academicians; stopping before a side table one of them was examining a dish of pears with the expression of detached curiosity that M. de Jussieu might have worn. Others, on either side of him, were casting about the room that gaze instinct with curiosity and coldness which Members of the Institute, who have arrived early, throw at the public, while they exchange a few murmured words which one fails to catch. They were faces well known to all the regular guests. One of them, however, was being pointed out, a newcomer with distended nostrils and a smug upper lip, who looked like a cleric; he was entering upon his duties there for the first time, and everyone gazed with interest at this newly elected candidate. But presently, perhaps to drive Robert away so that she might be alone with Aim\u00e9, Rachel began to make eyes at a young student, who was feeding with another man at a neighbouring table\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cZ\u00e9zette, let me beg you not to look at that young man like that,\u201d said Saint-Loup, on whose face the hesitating flush of a moment ago had been gathered now into a scarlet tide which dilated and darkened his swollen features, \u201cif you must make a scene here, I shall simply finish eating by myself and join you at the theatre afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point a messenger came up to tell Aim\u00e9 that he was wanted to speak to a gentleman in a carriage outside. Saint-Loup, ever uneasy, and afraid now that it might be some message of an amorous nature that was to be conveyed to his mistress, looked out of the window and saw there, sitting up in his brougham, his hands tightly buttoned in white gloves with black seams, a flower in his buttonhole, M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere; you see!\u201d he said to me in a low voice, \u201cmy family hunt me down even here. Will you, please \u2014 I can\u2019t very well do it myself, but you can, as you know the head waiter so well and he\u2019s certain to give us away \u2014 ask him not to go to the carriage. He can ahvays send some other waiter who doesn\u2019t know me. I know my uncle; if they tell him that I\u2019m not known here, he\u2019ll never come inside to look for me, he loathes this sort of place. Really, it\u2019s pretty disgusting that an old petticoat-chaser like him, who is still at it, too, should be perpetually lecturing me and coming to spy on me!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aim\u00e9 on receiving my instructions sent one of his underlings to explain that he was busy and could not come out at the moment, and (should the gentleman ask for the Marquis de Saint-Loup) that they did not know any such person. But Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress, who had failed to catch our whispered conversation and thought that it was still about the young man at whom Robert had been finding fault with her for making eyes, broke out in a torrent of rage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, indeed! So it\u2019s the young man over there, now, is it? Thank you for telling me; it\u2019s a real pleasure to have this sort of thing with one\u2019s meals! Don\u2019t listen to him, please; he\u2019s rather cross to-day, and, you know,\u201d she went on, turning to me, \u201che just says it because he thinks it smart, that it\u2019s the gentlemanly thing to appear jealous always.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she began with feet and fingers to shew signs of nervous irritation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Z\u00e9zette, it is I who find it unpleasant. You are making us all ridiculous before that gentleman, who will begin to imagine you\u2019re making overtures to him, and an impossible bounder he looks, too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, no, I think he\u2019s charming; for one thing, he\u2019s got the most adorable eyes, and a way of looking at women \u2014 you can feel he must love them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou can at least keep quiet until I\u2019ve left the room, if you have lost your senses,\u201d cried Robert. \u201cWaiter, my things.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not know whether I was expected to follow him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, I want to be alone,\u201d he told me in the same tone in which he had just been addressing his mistress, and as if he were quite furious with me. His anger was like a single musical phrase to which in an opera several lines are sung which are entirely different from one another, if one studies the words, in meaning and character, but which the music assimilates by a common sentiment. When Robert had gone, his mistress called Aim\u00e9 and asked him various questions. She then wanted to know what I thought of him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAn amusing expression, hasn\u2019t he? Do you know what I should like; it would be to know what he really thinks about things, to have him wait on me often, to take him travelling. But that would be all. If we were expected to love all the people who attract us, life would be pretty ghastly, wouldn\u2019t it? It\u2019s silly of Robert to get ideas like that. All that sort of thing, it\u2019s only just what comes into my head, that\u2019s all; Robert has nothing to worry about.\u201d She was still gazing at Aim\u00e9. \u201cDo look, what dark eyes he has. I should love to know what there is behind them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently came a message that Robert was waiting for her in a private room, to which he had gone to finish his luncheon, by another door, without having to pass through the restaurant again. I thus found myself alone, until I too was summoned by Robert. I found his mistress stretched out on a sofa laughing under the kisses and caresses that he was showering on her. They were drinking champagne. \u201cHallo, you!\u201d she cried to him, having recently picked up this formula which seemed to her the last word in playfulness and wit. I had fed badly, I was extremely uncomfortable, and albeit Legrandin\u2019s words had had no effect on me I was sorry to think that I was beginning in a back room of a restaurant and should be finishing in the wings of a theatre this first afternoon of spring. Looking first at the time to see that she was not making herself late, she offered me a glass of champagne, handed me one of her Turkish cigarettes and unpinned a rose for me from her bodice. Whereupon I said to myself: \u201cI have nothing much to regret, after all; these hours spent in this young woman\u2019s company are not wasted, since I have had from her, charming gifts which could not be bought too dear, a rose, a scented cigarette and a glass of champagne.\u201d I told myself this because I felt that it endowed with an aesthetic character and thereby justified, saved these hours of boredom. I ought perhaps to have reflected that the very need which I felt of a reason that would console me for my boredom was sufficient to prove that I was experiencing no aesthetic sensation. As for Robert and his mistress, they appeared to have no recollection of the quarrel which had been raging between them a few minutes earlier, or of my having been a witness to it. They made no allusion to it, sought no excuse for it any more than for the contrast with it which their present conduct formed. By dint of drinking champagne with them, I began to feel a little of the intoxication that used to come over me at Rivebelle, though probably not quite the same. Not only every kind of intoxication, from that which the sun or travelling gives us to that which we get from exhaustion or wine, but every degree of intoxication \u2014 and each must have a different figure, like the numbers of fathoms on a chart \u2014 lays bare in us exactly at the depth to which it reaches a different kind of man. The room which Saint-Loup had taken was small, but the mirror which was its sole ornament was of such a kind that it seemed to reflect thirty others in an endless vista; and the electric bulb placed at the top of the frame must at night, when the light was on, followed by the procession of thirty flashes similar to its own, give to the drinker, even when alone, the idea that the surrounding space was multiplying itself simultaneously with his sensations heightened by intoxication, and that, shut up by himself in this little cell, he was reigning nevertheless over something far more extensive in its indefinite luminous curve than a passage in the Jardin de Paris. Being then myself at this moment the said drinker, suddenly, looking for him in the glass, I caught sight of him, hideous, a stranger, who was staring at me. The joy of intoxication was stronger than my disgust; from gaiety or bravado I smiled at him, and simultaneously ne smiled back at me. And I felt myself so much under the ephemeral and Potent sway of the minute in which our sensations are so strong, that I am not sure whether my sole regret was not at the thought that this hideous self of whom I had just caught sight in the glass was perhaps there for the last time on earth, and that I should never meet the stranger again in the whole course of my life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert was annoyed only because I was not being more brilliant before his mistress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat about that fellow you met this morning, who combines snobbery with astronomy; tell her about him, I\u2019ve forgotten the story,\u201d and he watched her furtively\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, my dear boy, there\u2019s nothing more than what you\u2019ve just said.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a bore you are. Then tell her about Fran\u00e7oise in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. She\u2019ll enjoy that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, do! Bobby is always talking about Fran\u00e7oise.\u201d And taking Saint-Loup by the chin, she repeated, for want of anything more original, drawing the said chin nearer to the light: \u201cHallo, you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since actors had ceased to be for me exclusively the depositaries, in their diction and playing, of an artistic truth, they had begun to interest me in themselves; I amused myself, pretending that what I saw before me were the characters in some old humorous novel, by watching, struck by the fresh face of the young man who had just come into the stalls, the heroine listen distractedly to the declaration of love which the juvenile lead in the piece was addressing to her, while he, through the fiery torrent of his impassioned speech, still kept a burning gaze fixed on an old lady seated in a stage box, whose magnificent pearls had caught his eye; and thus, thanks especially to the information that Saint-Loup gave me as to the private lives of the players, I saw another drama, mute but expressive, enacted beneath the words of the spoken drama which in itself, although of no merit, interested me also; for I could feel in it that there were budding and opening for an hour in the glare of the footlights, created out of the agglutination on the face of an actor of another face of grease paint and pasteboard, on his own human soul the words of a part\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These ephemeral vivid personalities which the characters are in a play that is entertaining also, whom one loves, admires, pities, whom one would like to see again after one has left the theatre, but who by that time are already disintegrated into a comedian who is no longer in the position which he occupied in the play, a text which no longer shews one the comedian\u2019s face, a coloured powder which a handkerchief wipes off, who have returned in short to elements that contain nothing of them, since their dissolution, effected so soon after the end of the show, make us \u2014 like the dissolution of a dear friend \u2014 begin to doubt the reality of our ego and meditate on the mystery of death\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One number in the programme I found extremely trying. A young woman whom Rachel and some of her friends disliked was, with a set of old songs, to make a first appearance on which she had based all her hopes for the future of herself and her family. This young woman was blessed with unduly, almost grotesquely prominent hips and a pretty but too slight voice, weakened still farther by her excitement and in marked contrast to her muscular development. Rachel had posted among the audience a certain number of friends, male and female, whose business it was by their sarcastic comments to put the novice, who was known to be timid, out of countenance, to make her lose her head so that her turn should prove a complete failure, after which the manager would refuse to give her a contract. At the first notes uttered by the wretched woman, several of the male audience, recruited for that purpose, began pointing to her backward profile with jocular comments, several of the women, also in the plot, laughed out loud, each flute-like note from the stage increased the deliberate hilarity, which grew to a public scandal. The unhappy woman, sweating with anguish through her grease-paint, tried for a little longer to hold out then stopped and looked round the audience with an appealing gaze of misery and anger which succeeded only in increasing the uproar. The instinct to imitate others, the desire to shew their own wit and daring added to the party several pretty actresses who had not been forewarned but now threw at the others glances charged with malicious connivance, and sat convulsed with laughter which rang out in such violent peals that at the end of the second song, although there were still five more on the programme, the stage manager rang down the curtain. I tried to make myself pay no more heed to the incident than I had paid to my grandmother\u2019s sufferings when my great-aunt, to tease her, used to give my grandfather brandy, the idea of deliberate wickedness being too painful for me to bear. And yet, just as our pity for misfortune is perhaps not very exact since in our imagination we recreate a whole world of grief by which the unfortunate who has to struggle against it has no time to think of being moved to self-pity, so wickedness has probably not in the mind of the wicked man that pure and voluptuous cruelty which it so pains us to imagine. Hatred inspires him, anger gives him an ardour, an activity in which there is no great joy; he must be a sadist to extract any pleasure from it; ordinarily, the wicked man supposes himself to be punishing the wickedness of his victim; Rachel imagined certainly that the actress whom she was making suffer was far from being of interest to any one, and that anyhow, in having her hissed off the stage, she was herself avenging an outrage on good taste and teaching an unworthy comrade a lesson. Nevertheless, I preferred not to speak of this incident since I had had neither the courage nor the power to prevent it, and it would have been too painful for me, by saying any good of their victim, to approximate to a gratification of the lust for cruelty the sentiments which animated the tormentors who had strangled this career in its infancy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the opening scene of this afternoon\u2019s performance interested me in quite another way. It made me realise in part the nature of the illusion of which Saint-Loup was a victim with regard to Rachel, and which had set a gulf between the images that he and I respectively had in mind of his mistress, when we beheld her that morning among the blossoming pear trees. Rachel was playing a part which involved barely more than her walking on in the little play. But seen thus, she was another woman. She had one of those faces to which distance \u2014 and not necessarily that between stalls and stage, the world being in this respect only a larger theatre \u2014 gives form and outline and which, seen close at hand, dissolve back into dust. Standing beside her one saw only a nebula, a milky way of freckles, of tiny spots, nothing more. At a proper distance, all this ceased to be visible and, from cheeks that withdrew, were reabsorbed into her face, rose like a crescent moon a nose so fine, so pure that one would have liked to be object of Rachel\u2019s attention, to see her again as often as one chose, to her close to one, provided that one had not already seen her differently and at close range. This was not my case but it had been Saint-Loup\u2019s when he first saw her on the stage. Then he had asked himself how he might approach her, how come to know her, there had opened in him a whole fairy realm \u2014 that in which she lived \u2014 from which emanated an exquisite radiance but into which he might not penetrate. He had left the theatre telling himself that it would be madness to write to her, that she would not answer his letter, quite prepared to give his fortune and his name for the creature who was living in him in a world so vastly superior to those too familiar realities, a world made beautiful by desire and dreams of happiness, when at the back of the theatre, a little old building which had itself the air of being a piece of scenery, from the stage door he saw debouch the gay and daintily hatted band of actresses who had just been playing. Young men who knew them were waiting for them outside. The number of pawns on the human chessboard being less than the number of combinations that they are capable of forming, in a theatre from which are absent all the people we know and might have expected to find, there turns up one whom we never imagined that we should see again and who appears so opportunely that the coincidence seems to us providential, although no doubt some other coincidence would have occurred in its stead had we been not in that place but in some other, where other desires would have been aroused and we should have met some other old acquaintance to help us to satisfy them. The golden portals of the world of dreams had closed again upon Rachel before Saint-Loup saw her emerge from the theatre, so that the freckles and spots were of little importance. They vexed him nevertheless, especially as, being no longer alone, he had not now the same opportunity to dream as in the theatre. But she, for all that he could no longer see her, continued to dictate his actions, like those stars which govern us by their attraction even during the hours in which they are not visible to our eyes. And so his desire for the actress with the fine features which had no place now even in Robert\u2019s memory had the result that, dashing towards the old friend whom chance had brought to the spot, he insisted upon an introduction to the person with no features and with freckles, since she was the same person, telling himself that later on he would take care to find out which of the two this same person really was. She was in a hurry, she did not on this occasion say a single word to Saint-Loup, and it was only some days later that he finally contrived, by inducing her to leave her companions, to escort her home. He loved her already. The need for dreams, the desire to be made happy by her of whom one has dreamed, bring it about that not much time is required before one entrusts all one\u2019s chances of happiness to her who a few days since was but a fortuitous apparition, unknown, unmeaning, upon the boards of the theatre\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, the curtain having fallen, we moved on to the stage, alarmed at finding myself there for the first time, I felt the need to begin a spirited conversation with Saint-Loup. In this way my attitude, as I did not know what one ought to adopt in a setting that was strange to me, would be entirely dominated by our talk, and people would think that I was so absorbed in it, so unobservant of my surroundings, that it was quite natural that I should not shew the facial expressions proper to a place in which, to judge by what I appeared to be saying, I was barely conscious of standing; and seizing, to make a beginning, upon the first topic that came to my mind:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know,\u201d I said, \u201cI did come to say good-bye to you the day I left Donci\u00e8res; I\u2019ve not had an opportunity to mention it. I waved to you in the street.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t speak about it,\u201d he replied, \u201cI was so sorry. I passed you just outside the barracks, but I couldn\u2019t stop because I was late already. I assure you, I felt quite wretched about it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So he had recognised me! I saw again in my mind the wholly impersonal salute which he had given me, raising his hand to his cap, without a glance to indicate that he knew me, without a gesture to shew that he was sorry he could not stop. Evidently this fiction, which he had adopted at that moment, of not knowing me must have simplified matters for him greatly. But I was amazed to find that he had been able to compose himself to it so swiftly and without any instinctive movement to betray his original impression. I had already observed at Balbec that, side by side with that childlike sincerity of his face, the skin of which by its transparence rendered visible the sudden tide of certain emotions, his body had been admirably trained to perform a certain number of well-bred dissimulations, and that, like a consummate actor, he could, in his regimental and in his social life, play alternately quite different parts. In one of his parts he loved me tenderly, he acted towards me almost as if he had been my brother; my brother he had been, he was now again, but for a moment that day he had been another person who did not know me and who, holding the reins, his glass screwed to his eye, without a look or a smile had lifted his disengaged hand to the peak of his cap to give me correctly the military salute\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The stage scenery, still in its place, among which I was passing, seen thus at close range and without the advantage of any of those effects of lighting and distance on which the eminent artist whose brush had painted it had calculated, was a depressing sight, and Rachel, when I came near her, was subjected to a no less destructive force. The curves of her charming nose had stood out in perspective, between stalls and stage, like the relief of the scenery. It was no longer herself, I recognised her only thanks to her eyes, in which her identity had taken refuge. The form, the radiance of this young star, so brilliant a moment ago, had vanished. On the other hand \u2014 as though we came close to the moon and it ceased to present the appearance of a disk of rosy gold \u2014 on this face, so smooth a surface until now, I could distinguish only protuberances, discolourations, cavities. Despite the incoherence into which were resolved at close range not only the feminine features but the painted canvas, I was glad to be there to wander among the scenery, all that setting which at one time my love of nature had prompted me to dismiss as tedious and artificial until the description of it by Goethe in Wilhelm Meister had given it a sort of beauty in my eyes; and I had already observed with delight, in the thick of a crowd of journalists or men of friends of the actresses, who were greeting one another, talking, smoking, as though in a public thoroughfare, a young man in a black velvet cap and hortensia-coloured skirt, his cheeks chalked in red like a page from a Watteau album, who with his smiling lips, his eyes raised to the ceiling, as he sprang lightly into the air, seemed so entirely of another species than the rational folk in everyday clothes, in the midst of whom he was pursuing like a madman the course of his ecstatic dream, so alien to the preoccupations of their life, so anterior to the habits of their civilisation, so enfranchised from all the laws of nature, that it was as restful and as fresh a spectacle as watching a butterfly straying along a crowded street to follow with one\u2019s eyes, between the strips of canvas, the natural arabesques traced by his winged capricious painted oscillations. But at that moment Saint-Loup conceived the idea that his mistress was paying undue attention to this dancer, who was engaged now in practising for the last time the figure of fun with which he was going to take the stage, and his face darkened\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou might look the other way,\u201d he warned her gloomily. \u201cYou know that none of those dancer-fellows is worth the rope they can at least fall off and break their necks, and they\u2019re the sort of people who go about afterwards boasting that you\u2019ve taken notice of them. Besides, you know very well you\u2019ve been told to go to your dressing-room and change. You\u2019ll be missing your call again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A group of men \u2014 journalists \u2014 noticing the look of fury on Saint-Loup\u2019s face, came nearer, amused, to listen to what we were saying. And as the stage-hands had just set up some scenery on our other side we were forced into close contact with them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but I know him; he\u2019s a friend of mine,\u201d cried Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress, her eyes still fixed on the dancer. \u201cLook how well made he is, do watch those little hands of his dancing away by themselves like his whole body!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dancer turned his head towards her, and his human person appeared beneath the sylph that he was endeavouring to be, the clear grey jelly of his eyes trembled and sparkled between eyelids stiff with paint, and a smile extended the corners of his mouth into cheeks plastered with rouge; then, to amuse the girl, like a singer who hums to oblige us the air of the song in which we have told her that we admired her singing, he began to repeat the movement of his hands, counterfeiting himself with the fineness of a parodist and the good humour of a child\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, that\u2019s too lovely, the way he copies himself,\u201d she cried, clapping her hands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI implore you, my dearest girl,\u201d Saint-Loup broke in, in a tone of utter misery, \u201cdo not make a scene here, I can\u2019t stand it; I swear, if you say another word I won\u2019t go with you to your room, I shall walk straight out; come, don\u2019t be so naughty. . . . You oughtn\u2019t to stand about in the cigar smoke like that, it\u2019ll make you ill,\u201d he went on, to me, with the solicitude he had shewn for me in our Balbec days\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! What a good thing it would be if you did go.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI warn you, if I do I shan\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s more than I should venture to hope.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen; you know, I promised you the necklace if you behaved nicely to me, but the moment you treat me like this. . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Well, that doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least. You gave me your promise; I ought to have known you\u2019d never keep it. You want the whole world to know you\u2019re made of money, but I\u2019m not a money-grubber like you. You can keep your blasted necklace; I know some one else who\u2019ll give it to me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo one else can possibly give it to you; I\u2019ve told Boucheron he\u2019s to keep it for me, and I have his promise not to let anyone else have it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere you are, trying to blackmail me, you\u2019ve arranged everything, I see. That\u2019s what they mean by Marsantes, Mater Semita, it smells of the race,\u201d retorted Rachel quoting an etymology which was founded on a wild misinterpretation, for Semita means \u2018path\u2019 and not \u2018Semite,\u2019 but one which the Nationalists applied to Saint-Loup on account of the Dreyfusard views for which, so far as that went, he was indebted to the actress. She was less entitled than anyone to apply the word \u2018Jew\u2019 to Mme. de Marsantes, in whom the ethnologists of society could succeed in finding no trace of Judaism apart from her connexion with the L\u00e9vy-Mirepoix family. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t the last of it, I can tell you. An agreement like that isn\u2019t binding. You have acted treacherously towards me. Boucheron shall be told of it and he\u2019ll be paid twice as much for his necklace. You\u2019ll hear from me before long; don\u2019t you worry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert was in the right a hundred times over. But circumstances are always so entangled that the man who is in the right a hundred times may have been once in the wrong. And I could not help recalling that unpleasant and yet quite innocent expression which he had used at Balbec: \u201cIn that way I keep a hold over her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what I mean about the necklace. I made no formal promise: once you start doing everything you possibly can to make me leave you, it\u2019s only natural, surely, that I shouldn\u2019t give it to you; I fail to understand what treachery you can see in that, or what my ulterior motive is supposed to be. You can\u2019t seriously maintain that I brag about my money, I\u2019m always telling you that I\u2019m only a poor devil without a cent to my name. It\u2019s foolish of you take it in that way, my dear. What possible interest can I have in hurting you? You know very well that my one interest in life is yourself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, yes, yes, please go on,\u201d she retorted ironically, with the sweeping gesture of a barber wielding his razor. And turning to watch the dancer:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIsn\u2019t he too wonderful with his hands. A woman like me couldn\u2019t do the things he\u2019s doing now.\u201d She went closer to him and, pointing to Robert\u2019s furious face: \u201cLook, he\u2019s hurt,\u201d she murmured, in the momentary elation of a sadic impulse to cruelty totally out of keeping with the genuine feelings of affection for Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, for the last time, I swear to you it doesn\u2019t matter what you do \u2014 in a week you\u2019ll be giving anything to get me back \u2014 I shan\u2019t come; it\u2019s a clean cut, do you hear, it\u2019s irrevocable; you will be sorry one day, when it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps he was sincere in saying this, and the torture of leaving his mistress may have seemed to him less cruel than that of remaining with her in certain circumstances\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, my dear boy,\u201d he went on, to me, \u201cyou oughtn\u2019t to stand about here, I tell you, it will make you cough.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I pointed to the scenery which barred my way. He touched his hat and said to one of the journalists:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWould you mind, sir, throwing away your cigar; the smoke is bad for my friend.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His mistress had not waited for him to accompany her; on her way to her dressing-room she turned round and:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo they do those tricks with women too, those nice little hands?\u201d she flung to the dancer from the back of the stage, in an artificially melodious tone of girlish innocence. \u201cYou look just like one yourself, I\u2019m sure I could have a wonderful time with you and a girl I know.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s no rule against smoking that I know of; if people aren\u2019t well, they have only to stay at home,\u201d said the journalist\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dancer smiled mysteriously back at the actress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! Do stop! You\u2019ll make me quite mad,\u201d she cried to him. \u201cThen there will be trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn any case, sir, you are not very civil,\u201d observed Saint-Loup to the journalist, still with a courteous suavity, in the deliberate manner of a man judging retrospectively the rights and wrongs of an incident that is already closed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment I saw Saint-Loup raise his arm vertically above his head as if he had been making a signal to some one whom I could not see, or like the conductor of an orchestra, and indeed \u2014 without any greater transition than when, at a simple wave of the baton, in a symphony or a ballet, violent rhythms succeed a graceful andante \u2014 after the courteous words that he had just uttered he brought down his hand with a resounding smack upon the journalist\u2019s cheek\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now that to the measured conversations of the diplomats, to the smiling arts of peace had succeeded the furious onthrust of war, since blows lead to blows, I should not have been surprised to see the combatants swimming in one another\u2019s blood. But what I could not understand (like people who feel that it is not according to the rules when a war breaks out between two countries after some question merely of the rectification of a frontier, or when a sick man dies after nothing more serious than a swelling of the liver) was how Saint-Loup had contrived to follow up those words, which implied a distinct shade of friendliness, with an action which in no way arose out of them, which they had not, so to speak, announced, that action of an arm raised in defiance not only of the rights of man but of the law of cause and effect, that action created ex nihilo. Fortunately the journalist who, staggering back from the violence of the blow, had turned pale and hesitated for a moment, did not retaliate. As for his friends, one of them had promptly turned away his head and was looking fixedly into the wings for some one who evidently was not there; the second pretended that a speck of dust had got into his eye, and began rubbing and squeezing his eyelid with every sign of being in pain; while the third had rushed off, exclaiming: \u201cGood heavens, I believe the curtain\u2019s going up; we shan\u2019t get into our seats.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to speak to Saint-Loup, but he was so full of his indignation with the dancer that it adhered exactly to the surface of his eyeballs; like a subcutaneous structure it distended his cheeks with the result that, his internal agitation expressing itself externally in an entire immobility, he had not even the power of relaxation, the \u2018play\u2019 necessary to take in a word from me and to answer it. The journalist\u2019s friends, seeing that the incident was at an end, gathered round him again, still trembling. But, ashamed of having deserted him, they were absolutely determined that be should be made to suppose that they had noticed nothing. And so they dilated, one upon the speck of dust in his eye, one upon his false alarm when he had thought that the curtain was going up, the third upon the astonishing resemblance between a man who had just gone by and the speaker\u2019s brother. Indeed they seemed quite to resent their friend\u2019s not having shared their several emotions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat, didn\u2019t it strike you? You must be going blind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat I say is that you\u2019re a pack of curs,\u201d growled the journalist whom Saint-Loup had punished\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forgetting the poses they had adopted, to be consistent with which they ought \u2014 but they did not think of it \u2014 to have pretended not to understand what he meant, they fell back on certain expressions traditional in the circumstances: \u201cWhat\u2019s all the excitement? Keep your hair on, old chap. Don\u2019t take the bit in your teeth.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had realised that morning beneath the pear blossom how illusory were the grounds upon which Robert\u2019s love for \u2018Rachel when from the Lord\u2019 was based; I was bound now to admit how very real were the sufferings to which that love gave rise. Gradually the feeling that had obsessed him for the last hour, without a break, began to diminish, receded into him, an unoccupied pliable zone appeared in his eyes. I had stopped for a moment at a corner of the Avenue Gabriel from which I had often in the past seen Gilberte appear. I tried for a few seconds to recall those distant impressions, and was hurrying at a \u2018gymnastic\u2019 pace to overtake Saint-Loup when I saw that a gentleman, somewhat shabbily attired, appeared to be talking to him confidentially. I concluded that this was a personal friend of Robert; at the same time they seemed to be drawing even closer to one another; suddenly, as a meteor flashes through the sky, I saw a number of ovoid bodies assume with a giddy swiftness all the positions necessary for them to form, before Saint-Loup\u2019s face and body, a flickering constellation. Flung out like stones from a catapult, they seemed to me to be at the very least seven in number. They were merely, however, Saint-Loup\u2019s pair of fists, multiplied by the speed with which they were changing their places in this \u2014 to all appearance ideal and decorative \u2014 arrangement. But this elaborate display was nothing more than a pummelling which Saint-Loup was administering, the true character of which, aggressive rather than aesthetic, was first revealed to me by the aspect of the shabbily dressed gentleman who appeared to be losing at once his self-possession, his lower jaw and a quantity of blood. He gave fictitious explanations to the people who came up to question him, turned his head and, seeing that Saint-Loup had made off and was hastening to rejoin me, stood gazing after him with an offended, crushed, but by no means furious expression on his face. Saint-Loup, on the other hand, was furious, although he himself had received no blow, and his eyes were still blazing with anger when he reached me. The incident was in no way connected (as I had supposed) with the assault in the theatre. It was an impassioned loiterer who, seeing the fine looking young soldier that Saint-Loup was, had made overtures to him. My friend could not get over the audacity of this \u2018clique\u2019 who no longer even waited for the shades of night to cover their operations, and spoke of the suggestion that had been made to him with the same indignation as the newspapers use in reporting an armed assault and robbery, in broad daylight, in the centre of Paris. And yet the recipient of his blow was excusable in one respect, for the trend of the downward slope brings desire so rapidly to the point of enjoyment that beauty by itself appears to imply consent. Now, that Saint-Loup was beautiful was beyond dispute. Castigation such as he had just administered has this value, for men of the type that had accosted him, that it makes them think seriously of their conduct, though never for long enough to enable them to amend their ways and thus escape correction at the hands of the law. And so, although Saint-Loup\u2019s arm had shot out instinctively, without any preliminary thought, all such punishments, even when they reinforce the law, are powerless to bring about any uniformity in morals\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These incidents, particularly the one that was weighing most on his mind, seemed to have prompted in Robert a desire to be left alone for a while. After a moment\u2019s silence he asked me to leave him, and to go by myself to call on Mme. de Villeparisis. He would join me there, but preferred that we should not enter the room together, so that he might appear to have only just arrived in Paris, instead of having spent half the day already with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I had supposed before making the acquaintance of Mme. de Villeparisis at Balbec, there was a vast difference between the world in which she lived and that of Mme. de Guermantes. Mme. de Villeparisis was one of those women who, born of a famous house, entering by marriage into another no less famous, do not for all that enjoy any great position in the social world, and, apart from a few duchesses who are their nieces or sisters-in-law, perhaps even a crowned head or two, old family friends, see their drawing-rooms filled only by third-rate people, drawn from the middle classes or from a nobility either provincial or tainted in some way, whose presence there has long since driven away all such smart and snobbish folk as are not obliged to come to the house by ties of blood or the claims of a friendship too old to be ignored. Certainly I had no difficulty after the first few minutes in understanding how Mme. de Villeparisis, at Balbec, had come to be so well informed, better than ourselves even, as to the smallest details of the tour through Spain which my father was then making with M. de Norpois. Even this, however, did not make it possible to rest content with the theory that the intimacy \u2014 of more than twenty years\u2019 standing \u2014 between Mme. de Villeparisis and the Ambassador could have been responsible for the lady\u2019s loss of caste in a world where the smartest women boasted the attachment of lovers far less respectable than he not to mention that it was probably years since he had been anything more to the Marquise than just an old friend. Had Mme. de Villeparisis then had other adventures in days gone by? Being then of a more passionate temperament than now, in a calm and religious old age which nevertheless owed some of its mellow colouring to those ardent, vanished years, had she somehow failed, in the country neighbourhood where she had lived for so long, to avoid certain scandals unknown to the younger generation who simply took note of their effect in the unequal and defective composition of a visiting list bound, otherwise, to have been among the purest of any taint of mediocrity? That \u2018sharp tongue\u2019 which her nephew ascribed to her, had it in those far-off days made her enemies? Had it driven her into taking advantage of certain successes with men so as to avenge herself upon women? All this was possible; nor could the exquisitely sensitive way in which \u2014 giving so delicate a shade not merely to her words but to her intonation \u2014 Mme. de Villeparisis spoke of modesty or generosity be held to invalidate this supposition; for the people who not only speak with approval of certain virtues but actually feel their charm and shew a marvellous comprehension of them (people in fact who will, when they come to write their memoirs, present a worthy picture of those virtues) are often sprung from but not actually part of the silent, simple, artless generation which practised them. That generation is reflected in them but is not continued. Instead of the character which it possessed we find a sensibility, an intelligence which are not conducive to action. And whether or not there had been in the life of Mme. de Villeparisis any of those scandals, which (if there had) the lustre of her name would have blotted out, it was this intellect, resembling rather that of a writer of the second order than that of a woman of position, that was undoubtedly the cause of her social degradation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that they were not specially elevating, the qualities, such as balance and restraint, which Mme. de Villeparisis chiefly extolled; but to speak of restraint in a manner that shall be entirely adequate, the word \u2018restraint\u2019 is not enough, we require some of the qualities of authorship which presuppose a quite unrestrained exaltation; I had remarked at Balbec that the genius of certain great artists was completely unintelligible to Mme. de Villeparisis; and that all she could do was to make delicate fun of them and to express her incomprehension in a graceful and witty form. But this wit and grace, at the point to which she carried them, became themselves \u2014 on another plane, and even although they were employed to belittle the noblest masterpieces \u2014 true artistic qualities. Now the effect of such qualities on any social position is a morbid activity of the kind which doctors call elective, and so disintegrating that the most firmly established pillars of society are hard put to it to hold out for any length of time. What artists call intellect seems pure presumption to the fashionable world which, unable to place itself at the sole point of view from which they, the artists, look at and judge things, incapable of understanding the particular attraction to which they yield when they choose an ex-Pression or start a friendship, feel in their company an exhaustion, an irritation, from which antipathy very shortly springs. And yet in her conversation, and the same may be said of the Memoirs which she afterwards published, Mme. de Villeparisis shewed nothing but a sort of grace that was eminently social. Having passed by great works without mastering sometimes without even noticing them, she had preserved from the period in which she had lived and which, moreover, she described with great aptness and charm, little more than the most frivolous of the gifts that they had had to offer her. But a narrative of this sort, even when it treats exclusively of subjects that are not intellectual, is still a work of the intellect, and to give in a book or in conversation, which is almost the same thing, a deliberate impression of frivolity, a serious touch is required which a purely frivolous person would be incapable of supplying. In a certain book of reminiscences written by a woman and regarded as a masterpiece, the phrase that people quote as a model of airy grace has always made me suspect that, in order to arrive at such a pitch of lightness, the author must originally have had a rather stodgy education, a boring culture, and that as a girl she probably appeared to her friends an insufferable prig. And between certain literary qualities and social failure the connexion is so inevitable that when we open Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s Memoirs to-day, on any page a fitting epithet, a sequence of metaphors will suffice to enable the reader to reconstruct the deep but icy bow which must have been bestowed on the old Marquise on the staircases of the Embassies by a snob like Mme. Leroi, who perhaps may have left a card on her when she went to call on the Guermantes, but never set foot in her house for fear of losing caste among all the doctors\u2019 or solicitors\u2019 wives whom she would find there. A bluestocking Mme. de Villeparisis had perhaps been in her earliest youth, and, intoxicated with the ferment of her own knowledge, had perhaps failed to realise the. importance of not applying to people in society, less intelligent and less educated than herself, those cutting strokes which the injured party never forgets\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, talent is not a separate appendage which one artificially attaches to those qualities which make for social success, in order to create from the whole what people in society call a \u2018complete woman.\u2019 It is the living product of a certain moral complexion, from which as a rule many moral qualities are lacking and in which there predominates a sensibility of which other manifestations such as we do not notice in a book may make themselves quite distinctly felt in the course of a life, certain curiosities for instance, certain whims, the desire to go to this place or that for one\u2019s own amusement and not with a view to the extension, the maintenance or even the mere exercise of one\u2019s social relations. I had seen at Balbec Mme. de Villeparisis hemmed in by a bodyguard of her own servants without even a glance, as she passed, at the people sitting in the hall of the hotel. But I had had a presentiment that this abstention was due not to indifference, and it seemed that she had not always confined herself to it. She would get a sudden craze to know some one or other because she had seen him and thought him good-looking, or merely because she had been told that he was amusing, or because he had struck her as different from the people she knew, who at this period, when she had not yet begun to appreciate them because she imagined that they would never fail her, belonged, all of them, to the purest cream of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. To the bohemian, the humble middle-class gentleman whom she had marked out with her favour she was obliged to address invitations the importance of which he was unable to appreciate, with an insistence which began gradually to depreciate her in the eyes of the snobs who were in the habit of estimating the smartness of a house by the people whom its mistress excluded rather than by those whom she entertained. Certainly, if at a given moment in her youth Mme. de Villeparisis, surfeited with the satisfaction of belonging to the fine flower of the aristocracy, had found a sort of amusement in scandalising the people among whom she lived, and in deliberately impairing her own position in society, she had begun to attach its full importance to that position once it was definitely lost. She had wished to shew the Duchesses that she was better than they, by saying and doing all the things that they dared not say or do. But now that they all, save such as were closely related to her, had ceased to call, she felt herself diminished, and sought once more to reign, but with another sceptre than that of wit. She would have liked to attract to her house all those women whom she had taken such pains to drive away. How many women\u2019s lives, lives of which little enough is known (for we all live in different worlds according to our ages, and the discretion of their elders prevents the young from forming any clear idea of the past and so completing the cycle), have been divided in this way into contrasted periods, the last being entirely devoted to the reconquest of what in the second has been so light-heartedly flung on the wind. Flung on the wind in what way? The young people are all the less capable of imagining it, since they see before them an elderly and respectable Marquise de Villeparisis and have no idea that the grave diarist of the present day, so dignified beneath her pile of snowy hair, can ever have been a gay midnight-reveller who was perhaps the delight in those days, devoured the fortunes perhaps of men now sleeping in their graves; that she should also have set to work, with a persevering and natural industry, to destroy the position which she owed to her high birth does not in the least imply that even at that remote period Mme. de Villeparisis did not attach great importance to her position. In the same way the web of isolation, of inactivity in which a neurasthenic lives may be woven by him from morning to night without therefore seeming endurable, and while he is hastening to add another mesh to the net which holds him captive, it is possible that he is dreaming only of dancing, sport and travel. We are at work every moment upon giving its form to our life, but we do so by copying unintentionally, like the example in a book, the features of the person that we are and not of him who we should like to be. The disdainful bow of Mme. Leroi might to some extent be expressive of the true nature of Mme. de Villeparisis; it in no way corresponded to her ambition\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt at the same moment at which Mme. Leroi was \u2014 to use an expression beloved of Mme. Swann \u2014\u2018cutting\u2019 the Marquise, the latter could seek consolation in remembering how Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie had once said to her: \u201cYou are just like a daughter to me.\u201d But such marks of royal friendship, secret and unknown to the world, existed for the Marquise alone, dusty as the diploma of an old Conservatoire medalist. The only true social advantages are those that create life, that can disappear without the person who has benefited by them needing to try to keep them or to make them public, because on the same day a hundred others will take their place. And for all that she could remember the Queen\u2019s using those words to her, she would nevertheless have bartered them gladly for the permanent faculty of being asked everywhere which Mme. Leroi possessed as in a restaurant a great but unknown artist whose genius is written neither in the lines of his bashful face nor in the antiquated cut of his threadbare coat, would willingly be even the young stock-jobber, of the lowest grade of society, who is sitting with a couple of actresses at a neighbouring table to which in an obsequious and incessant chain come hurrying manager, head waiter, pages and even the scullions who file out of the kitchen to salute him, as in the fairy-tales, while the wine waiter advances, dust-covered like his bottles, limping and dazed, as if on his way up from the cellar he had twisted his foot before emerging into the light of day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be remarked, however, that in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room the absence of Mme. Leroi, if it distressed the lady of the house, passed unperceived by the majority of her guests. They were entirely ignorant of the peculiar position which Mme. Leroi occupied, a: position known only to the fashionable world, and never doubted that Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s receptions were, as the readers of her Memoirs to-day are convinced that they must have been, the most brilliant in Paris\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the occasion of this first call which, after leaving Saint-Loup, I went to pay on Mme. Villeparisis, following the advice given by M. de Norpois to my father, I found her in her drawing-room hung with yellow silk, against which the sofas and the admirable armchairs upholstered in Beauvais tapestry stood out with the almost purple redness of ripe raspberries. Side by side with the Guermantes and Villeparisis portraits one saw those \u2014 gifts from the sitters themselves \u2014 of Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie, the Queen of the Belgians, the Prince de Joinville and the Empress of Austria. Mme. de Villeparisis herself, capped with an old-fashioned bonnet of black lace (which she preserved with the same instinctive sense of local or historical colour as a Breton inn-keeper who, however Parisian his customers may have become, feels it more in keeping to make his maids dress in coifs and wide sleeves), was seated at a little desk on which in front of her, as well as her brushes, her palette and an unfinished flower-piece in water-colours, were arranged in glasses, in saucers, in cups, moss-roses, zinnias, maidenhair ferns, which on account of the sudden influx of callers she had just left off painting, and which had the effect of being piled on a florist\u2019s counter in some eighteenth-century mezzotint. In this drawing-room, which had been slightly heated on purpose because the Marquise had caught cold on the journey from her house in the country, there were already when I arrived a librarian with whom Mme. de Villeparisis had spent the morning in selecting the autograph letters to herself from various historical personages which were to figure in facsimile as documentary evidence in the Memoirs which she was preparing for the press, and a historian, solemn and tongue-tied, who hearing that she had inherited and still possessed a portrait of the Duchesse de Montmorency, had come to ask her permission to reproduce it as a plate in his work on the Fronde; a party strengthened presently by the addition of my old friend Bloch, now a rising dramatist, upon whom she counted to secure the gratuitous services of actors and actresses at her next series of afternoon parties. It was true that the social kaleidoscope was in the act of turning and that the Dreyfus case was shortly to hurl the Jews down to the lowest rung of the social ladder. But, for one thing, the anti-Dreyfus cyclone might rage as it would, it is not in the first hour of a storm that the waves are highest. In the second place, Mme. de Villeparisis, leaving a whole section of her family to fulminate against the Jews, had hitherto kept herself entirely aloof from the Case and never gave it a thought. Lastly, a young man like Bloch, whom no one knew, might pass unperceived, whereas leading Jews, representatives of their party, were already threatened. He had his chin pointed now by a goat-beard, wore double glasses and a long frock coat, and carried a glove like a roll of papyrus in his hand. The Rumanians, the Egyptians, the Turks may hate the Jews. But in a French drawing-room the differences between those peoples are not so apparent, and an Israelite making his entry as though he were emerging from the heart of the desert, his body crouching like a hyaena\u2019s, his neck thrust obliquely forward, spreading himself in profound \u2018salaams,\u2019 completely satisfies a certain taste for the oriental. Only it is essential that the Jew should not be actually \u2018in\u2019 society, otherwise he will readily assume the aspect of a lord and his manners become so Gallicised that on his face a rebellious nose, growing like a nasturtium in any but the right direction, will make one think rather of Mascarille\u2019s nose than of Solomon\u2019s. But Bloch, not having been rendered supple by the gymnastics of the Faubourg, nor ennobled by a crossing with England or Spain, remained for a lover of the exotic as strange and savoury a spectacle, in spite of his European costume, as one of Decamps\u2019s Jews. Marvellous racial power which from the dawn of time thrusts to the surface, even in modern Paris, on the stage of our theatres, behind the pigeonholes of our public offices, at a funeral, in the street, a solid phalanx, setting their mark upon our modern ways of hairdressing, absorbing, making us forget, disciplining the frock coat which on them remains not at all unlike the garment in which Assyrian scribes are depicted in ceremonial attire on the frieze of a monument at Susa before the gates of the Palace of Darius. (Later in the afternoon Bloch might have imagined that it was out of anti-semitic malice that M. de Charlus inquired whether his first name was Jewish, whereas it was simply from aesthetic interest and love of local colour.) But, to revert for a moment, when we speak of racial persistence we do not accurately convey the impression we receive from Jews, Greeks, Persians, all those peoples whom it is better to leave with their differences. We know from classical paintings the faces of the ancient Greeks, we have seen Assyrians on the walls of a palace at Susa. And so we feel, on encountering in a Paris drawing-room Orientals belonging to one or another group, that we are in the presence of creatures whom the forces of necromancy must have called to life. We knew hitherto only a superficial image; behold it has gained depth, it extends into three dimensions, it moves. The young Greek lady, daughter of a rich banker and the latest favourite of society, looks exactly like one of those dancers who in the chorus of a ballet at once historical and aesthetic symbolise in flesh and blood the art of Hellas; and yet in the theatre the setting makes these images somehow trite; the spectacle, on the other hand, to which the entry into a drawing-room of a Turkish lady or a Jewish gentleman admits us, by animating their features makes them appear stranger still, as if they really were creatures evoked by the effort of a medium. It is the soul (or rather the pigmy thing to which \u2014 up to the present, at any rate \u2014 the soul is reduced in this sort of materialisation), it is the soul of which we have caught glimpses hitherto in museums alone, the soul of the ancient Greeks, of the ancient Hebrews, torn from a life at once insignificant and transcendental, which seems to be enacting before our eyes this disconcerting pantomime. In the young Greek lady who is leaving the room what we seek in vain to embrace is the figure admired long ago on the side of a vase. I felt that if I had in the light of Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room taken photographs of Bloch, they would have furnished of Israel the same image \u2014 so disturbing because it does not appear to emanate from humanity, so deceiving because all the same it is so strangely like humanity \u2014 which we find in spirit photographs. There is nothing, to speak more generally, not even the insignificance of the remarks made by the people among whom we spend our lives, that does not give us a sense of the supernatural, in our everyday world where even a man of genius from whom we expect, gathered as though around a turning-table, to learn the secret of the Infinite utters only these words \u2014 the same that had just issued from the lips of Bloch: \u201cTake care of my top hat.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Ministers, my dear sir,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis was saying, addressing herself specially to my friend, and picking up the thread of a conversation which had been broken by my arrival: \u201cnobody ever wanted to see them. I was only a child at the time, but I can remember so well the King begging my grandfather to invite M. Decazes to a rout at which my father was to dance with the Duchesse de Berry. \u2018It will give me pleasure, Florimond,\u2019 said the King. My grandfather, who was a little deaf, thought he had said M. de Castries, which seemed a perfectly natural thing to ask. When he understood that it was M. Decazes, he was furious at first, but he gave in, and wrote a note the same evening to M. Decazes, begging him to pay my grandfather the compliment and give him the honour of his presence at the ball which he was giving the following week. For we were polite, sir, in those days, and no hostess would have dreamed of simply sending her card and writing on it \u2018Tea\u2019 or \u2018Dancing\u2019 or \u2018Music.\u2019 But if we understood politeness we were not incapable of impertinence either. M. Decazes accepted, but the day before the ball it was given out that my grandfather felt indisposed and had cancelled his invitations. He had obeyed the King, but he had not had M. Decazes at his ball. . . . Yes, sir, I remember M. Mole very well, he was a clever man \u2014 he shewed that in his reception of M. de Vigny at the Academy \u2014 but he was very pompous, and I can see him now coming downstairs to dinner in his own house with his tall hat in his hand.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! that is typically suggestive of what must have been a pretty perniciously philistine epoch, for it was no doubt a universal habit to carry one\u2019s hat in one\u2019s hand in one\u2019s own house,\u201d observed Bloch, anxious to make the most of so rare an opportunity of learning from an eyewitness details of the aristocratic life of another day, while the librarian, who was a sort of intermittent secretary to the Marquise, gazed at her tenderly as though he were saying to the rest of us: \u201cThere, you see what she\u2019s like, she knows everything, she has met everybody, you can ask her anything you like, she\u2019s quite amazing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, dear, no,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis, drawing nearer to her as she spoke the glass containing the maidenhair which presently she would begin again to paint, \u201cit was a habit M. Mole had; that was all. I never saw my father carry his hat in the house, except of course when the King came, because the King being at home wherever he is the master of the house is only a visitor then in his own drawing-room.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAristotle tells us in the second chapter of . . . \u201d ventured M. Pierre, the historian of the Fronde, but so timidly that no one paid any attention. Having been suffering for some weeks from a nervous insomnia which resisted every attempt at treatment, he had given up going to bed, and, half-dead with exhaustion, went out only whenever his work made it imperative. Incapable of repeating at all often these expeditions which, simple enough for other people, cost him as much effort as if, to make them, he was obliged to come down from the moon, he was surprised to be brought up so frequently against the fact that other people\u2019s lives were not organised on a constant and permanent basis so as to furnish the maximum utility to the sudden outbursts of his own. He sometimes found the doors shut of a library which he had reached only after setting himself artificially on his feet and in a frock coat like some automaton in a story by Mr. Wells. Fortunately he had found Mme. de Villeparisis at home and was going to be shewn the portrait\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile he was cut short by Bloch. \u201cIndeed,\u201d the latter remarked, referring to what Mme. de Villeparisis had said as to the etiquette for royal visits. \u201cDo you know, I never knew that,\u201d as though it were strange that he should not have known it always\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTalking of that sort of visit, you heard the stupid joke my nephew Basin played on me yesterday morning?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis asked the librarian. \u201cHe told my people, instead of announcing him, to say that it was the Queen of Sweden who had called to see me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat! He made them tell you just like that! I say, he must have a nerve,\u201d exclaimed Bloch with a shout of laughter, while the historian smiled with a stately timidity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was quite surprised, because I had only been back from the country a few days; I had specially arranged, just to be left in peace for a little, that no one was to be told that I was in Paris, and I asked myself how the Queen of Sweden could have heard so soon,\u201d went on Mme. de Villeparisis, leaving her guests amazed to find that a visit from the Queen of Sweden was in itself nothing out of the common to their hostess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Earlier in the day Mme. de Villeparisis might have been collaborating with the librarian in arranging the illustrations to her Memoirs; now she was, quite unconsciously, trying their effect on an average public typical of that from which she would eventually have to enlist her readers. Hers might be different in many ways from a really fashionable drawing-room in which you would have been struck by the absence of a number of middle dass ladies to whom Mme. de Villeparisis was \u2018at home,\u2019 and would have noticed instead such brilliant leaders of fashion as Mme. Leroi had in course of time managed to secure, but this distinction is not perceptible in her Memoirs, from which certain unimportant friendships of the author have disappeared because there is never any occasion to refer to them; while the absence of those who did not come to see her leaves no gap because, in the necessarily restricted space at the author\u2019s disposal, only a few persons can appear, and if these persons are royal personages, historic personalities, then the utmost impression of distinction which any volume of memoirs can convey to the public is achieved. In the opinion of Mme. Leroi, Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s parties were third-rate; and Mme. de Villeparisis felt the sting of Mme. Leroi\u2019s opinion. But hardly anyone to-day remembers who Mme. Leroi was, her opinions have vanished into thin air, and it is the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, frequented as it was by the Queen of Sweden, and as it had been by the Due d\u2019Aumale, the Duc de Broglie, Thiers, Montalembert, Mgr. Dupanloup, which will be looked upon as one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century by that posterity which has not changed since the days of Homer and Pindar, and for which the enviable things are exalted birth, royal or quasi-royal, and the friendship of kings, the leaders of the people and other eminent men\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now of all this Mme. de Villeparisis had her share in the people who still came to her house and in the memories \u2014 sometimes slightly \u2018touched up\u2019\u2014 by means of which she extended her social activity into the past. And then there was M. de Norpois who, while unable to restore his friend to any substantial position in society, did indeed bring to her house such foreign or French statesmen as might have need of his services and knew that the only effective method of securing them was to pay court to Mme. de Villeparisis. Possibly Mme. Leroi also knew these European celebrities. But, as a well-mannered woman who avoids anything that suggests the bluestocking, she would as little have thought of mentioning the Eastern question to her Prime Ministers as of discussing the nature of love with her novelists and philosophers. \u201cLove?\u201d she had once replied to a pushing lady who had asked her: \u201cWhat are your views on love?\u201d\u2014\u201cLove? I make it, constantly, but I never talk about it.\u201d When she had any of these literary or political lions in her house she contented herself, as did the Duchesse de Guermantes, with setting them down to play poker. They often preferred this to the serious conversations on general ideas in which Mme. de Villeparisis forced them to engage. But these conversations, ridiculous as in the social sense they may have been, have furnished the Memoirs of Mme. de Villeparisis with those admirable passages, those dissertations on politics which read so well in volumes of autobiography, as they do in Corneille\u2019s tragedies. Furthermore, the parties of the Villeparisis of this world are alone destined to be handed down to posterity, because the rerois of this world cannot write, and, if they could, would not have the time. And if the literary bent of the Villeparisis is the cause of the Lerois\u2019 disdain, the disdain of the Lerois does, in its turn, a singular service to the literary bent of the Villeparisis by affording the bluestockings that leisure which the career of letters requires. God, Whose Will it is that there should be a few books in the world well written, breathes with that purpose such disdain into the hearts of the Lerois, for He knows that if these should invite the Villeparisis to dinner the latter would at once rise from their writing tables and order their carriages to be round at eight\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently there came into the room, with slow and solemn step, an oid lady of tall stature who, beneath the raised brim of her straw hat, revealed a monumental pile of snowy hair in the style of Marie-Antoinette. I did not then know that she was one of three women who were still to be seen in Parisian society and who, like Mme. de Villeparisis, while all of the noblest birth, had been reduced, for reasons which were IKJW lost in the night of time and could have been told us only by some old gallant of their period, to entertaining only certain of the dregs of society who were not sought after elsewhere. Each of these ladies had her own \u2018Duchesse de Guermantes,\u2019 the brilliant niece who came regularly to pay her respects, but none of them could have succeeded in attracting to her house the \u2018Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019 of either of the others. Mme. de Villeparisis was on the best of terms with these three ladies, but she did not like them. Perhaps the similarity between their social position and her own gave her an impression of them which was not pleasing. Besides, soured bluestockings as they were, seeking by the number and frequency of the drawing-room comedies which they arranged in their houses to give themselves the illusion of a regular salon, there had grown up among them a rivalry which the decay of her fortune in the course of a somewhat tempestuous existence reduced for each of them, when it was a question of securing the kind assistance of a professional actor or actress, into a sort of struggle for life. Furthermore, the lady with the Mark-Antoinette hair, whenever she set eyes on Mme. de Villeparisis, could not help being reminded of the fact that the Duchesse de Guermantes did not come to her Fridays. Her consolation was that at these same Fridays she could always count on having, blood being thicker than water, the Princesse de Poix, who was her own personal Guermantes, and who never went near Mme. de Villeparisis, albeit Mme. de Poix was an intimate friend of the Duchess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless from the mansion on the Quai Malaquais to the drawing-rooms of the Rue de Tournon, the Rue de la Chaise and the Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9, a bond as compelling as it was hateful united the three fallen goddesses, as to whom I would fain have learned by searching in some dictionary of social mythology through what gallant adventure, what sacrilegious presumption, they had incurred their punishment. Their common brilliance of origin, the common decay of their present state entered largely, no doubt, into the necessity which compelled them, while hating one another, to frequent one another\u2019s society. Besides, each of them found in the others a convenient way of being polite to her own guests. How should these fail to suppose that they had scaled the most inaccessible peak of the Faubourg when they were introduced to a lady with a string of titles whose sister was married to a Duc de Sagan or a Prince de Ligne? Especially as there was infinitely more in the newspapers about these sham salons than about the genuine ones. Indeed these old ladies\u2019 \u2018men about town\u2019 nephews \u2014 and Saint-Loup the foremost of them \u2014 when asked by a friend to introduce him to people, would answer at once \u201cI will take you to see my aunt Villeparisis,\u201d (or whichever it was) \u201cyou meet interesting people there.\u201d They knew very well that this would mean less trouble for themselves than trying to get the said friends invited by the smart nieces or sisters-in-law of these ladies. Certain very old men and young women who had heard it from those men, told me that if these ladies were no longer received in society it was because of the extraordinary irregularity of their conduct, which, when I objected that irregular conduct was not necessarily a barrier to social success, was represented to me as having gone far beyond anything that we know to-day. The misconduct of these solemn dames who held themselves so erect assumed on the lips of those who hinted at it something that I was incapable of imagining, proportionate to the magnitude of prehistoric days, to the age of the mammoth. In a word, these three Parcae with their white or blue or red locks had spun the fatal threads of an incalculable number of gentlemen. I felt that the people of to-day exaggerated the vices of those fabulous times, like the Greeks who created Icarus, Theseus, Heracles out of men who had been but little different from those who long afterwards deified them. But one does not tabulate the sum of a person\u2019s vices until he has almost ceased to be in a fit state to practise them, when from the magnitude of his social punishment, which is then nearing the completion of its term and which alone one can estimate, one measures, one imagines, one exaggerates that of the crime that has been committed. In that gallery of symbolical figures which is \u2018society,\u2019 the really light women, the true Messalinas, invariably present the solemn aspect of a lady of at least seventy, with an air of lofty distinction, who entertains everyone she can but not everyone she would like to have, to whose house women will never consent to go whose own conduct falls in any way short of perfection, to whom the Pope regularly sends his Golden Rose, and who as often as not has written \u2014 on the early days of Lamartine \u2014 an essay that has been crowned by the French Academy. \u201cHow d\u2019ye do, Alix?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis greeted the Marie-Antoinette lady, which lady cast a searching glance round the assembly to see whether there was not in this drawing-room any item that might be a valuable addition to her own, in which case she would have to discover it for herself, for Mme. de Villeparisis, she was sure, would be spiteful enough to try to keep it from her. Thus Mme. de Villeparisis took good care not to introduce Bloch to the old lady for fear of his being asked to produce the same play that he was arranging for her in the drawing-room of the Quai Malaquais. Besides it was only tit for tat. For, the evening before, the old lady had had Mme. Ristori, who had recited, and had taken care that Mme. de Villeparisis, from whom she had filched the Italian artist, should not hear of this function until it was over. So that she should not read it first in the newspapers and feel annoyed, the old lady had come ill nerson to tell her about it, shewing no sense of guilt. Mme. de Villeparisis, considering that an introduction of myself was not likely to have the same awkward results as that of Bloch, made me known to the Marie-Antoinette of the Quai Malaquais. The latter, who sought, by making the fewest possible movements, to preserve in her old age those lines, as of a Coysevox goddess, which had years ago charmed the young men of fashion and which spurious poets still celebrated in rhymed charades \u2014 and had acquired the habit of a lofty and compensating stiffness common to all those whom a personal degradation obliges to be continually making advances \u2014 just perceptibly lowered her head with a frigid majesty, and, turning the other way, took no more notice of me than if I had not existed. By this crafty attitude she seemed to be assuring Mme. de Villeparisis: \u201cYou see, I\u2019m nowhere near him; please understand that I\u2019m not interested \u2014 in any sense of the word, you old cat \u2014 in little boys.\u201d But when, twenty minutes later, she left the room, taking advantage of the general conversation, she slipped into my ear an invitation to come to her box the following Friday with another of the three, whose high-sounding name \u2014 she had been born a Choiseul, moreover \u2014 had a prodigious effect on me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI understand, sir, that you are thinkin\u2019 of writin\u2019 somethin\u2019 about Mme. la Duchesse de Montmorency,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to the historian of the Fronde in that grudging tone which she allowed, quite unconsciously, to spoil the effect of her great and genuine kindness, a tone due to the shrivelling crossness, the sense of grievance that is a physiological accompaniment of age, as well as to the affectation of imitating the almost rustic speech of the old nobility: \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to let you see her portrait, the original of the copy they have in the Louvre.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She rose, laying down her brushes beside the flowers, and the little apron which then came into sight at her waist, and which she wore so as not to stain her dress with paints, added still further to the impression of an old peasant given by her bonnet and her big spectacles, and offered a sharp contrast to the luxury of her appointments, the butler who had brought in the tea and cakes, the liveried footman for whom she now rang to light up the portrait of the Duchesse de Montmorency, Abbess of one of the most famous Chapters in the East of France. Everyone had risen. \u201cWhat is rather amusin\u2019,\u201d said our hostess, \u201cis that in these Chapters where our great-aunts were so often made Abbesses, the daughters of the King of France would not have been admitted. They were very close corporations.\u201d \u201cNot admit the King\u2019s daughters,\u201d cried Bloch in amazement, \u201cwhy ever not?\u201d \u201cWhy, because the House of France had not enough quartering after that low marriage.\u201d Bloch\u2019s bewilderment increased. \u201cA low marriage? The House of France? When was that?\u201d \u201cWhy, when they married into the Medicis,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis in the most natural manner. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine picture, ain\u2019t it, and in a perfect state of preservation,\u201d she added\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018My dear,\u201d put in the Marie-Antoinette lady, \u201csurely you remember that when I brought Liszt to see you he said that it was this one that was the copy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should bow to any opinion of Liszt on music, but not on painthe Besides, he was quite off his head then, and I don\u2019t remember his ever saying anything of the sort. But it wasn\u2019t you that brought him here. I had met him any number of times at dinner at Princess Sayn-Wittgenstein\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alix\u2019s shot had missed fire; she stood silent, erect and motionless. Plastered with layers of powder, her face had the appearance of a face of stone. And, as the profile was noble, she seemed, on a triangular and moss-grown pedestal hidden by her cape, the time-worn stucco goddess of a park\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, I see another fine portrait,\u201d began the historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The door opened and the Duchesse de Guermantes entered the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, how are you?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis greeted her without moving her head, taking from her apron-pocket a hand which she held out to the newcomer; and then ceasing at once to take any notice of her niece, in order to return to the historian: \u201cThat is the portrait of the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld. . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A young servant with a bold manner and a charming face (but so finely chiselled, to ensure its perfection, that the nose was a little red and the rest of the skin slightly flushed as though they were still smarting from the recent and sculptural incision) came in bearing a card on a salver\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is that gentleman who has been several times to see Mme. la Marquise.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDid you tell him I was at home?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe heard the voices.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, very well then, shew him in. It\u2019s a man who was introduced to me,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe told me he was very anxious to come to the house. I certainly never said he might. But here he\u2019s taken the trouble to call five times now; it doesn\u2019t do to hurt people\u2019s feelings. Sir,\u201d she went on to me, \u201cand you, Sir,\u201d to the historian of the Fronde, \u201clet me introduce my niece, the Duchesse de Guermantes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The historian made a low bow, as I did also, and since he seemed to suppose that some friendly remark ought to follow this salute, his eyes brightened and he was preparing to open his mouth when he was once more frozen by the sight of Mme. de Guermantes who had taken advantage of the independence of her torso to throw it forward with an exaggerated politeness and bring it neatly back to a position of rest without letting face or eyes appear to have noticed that anyone was standing before them; after breathing a gentle sigh she contented herself with manifesting the nullity of the impression that had been made on her by the sight of the historian and myself by performing certain movements of her nostrils with a precision that testified to the absolute inertia of her unoccupied attention\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The importunate visitor entered the room, making straight for Mme. de Villeparisis with an ingenuous, fervent air: it was Legrandin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you so very much for letting me come and see you,\u201d he began, laying stress on the word \u2018very.\u2019 \u201cIt is a pleasure of a quality altogether rare and subtle that you confer on an old solitary; I assure you that its repercussion . . . \u201d He stopped short on catching sight of me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just shewing this gentleman a fine portrait of the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld, the wife of the author of the Maxims; it\u2019s a family picture.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes meanwhile had greeted Alix, with apologies for not having been able, that year as in every previous year, to go and see her. \u201cI hear all about you from Madeleine,\u201d she added\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe was at luncheon with me to-day,\u201d said the Marquise of the Quai Malaquais, with the satisfying reflexion that Mme. de Villeparisis could never say that\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile I had been talking to Bloch, and fearing, from what I had been told of his father\u2019s change of attitude towards him, that he might be envying my life, I said to him that his must be the happier of the two. My remark was prompted solely by my desire to be friendly. But such friendliness readily convinces those who cherish a high opinion of themselves of their own good fortune, or gives them a desire to convince other people. \u201cYes, I do lead a delightful existence,\u201d Bloch assured me with a beatified smile. \u201cI have three great friends; I do not wish for one more; an adorable mistress; I am infinitely happy. Rare is the mortal to whom Father Zeus accords so much felicity.\u201d I fancy that he was anxious principally to extol himself and to make me envious. Perhaps too there was some desire to shew originality in his optimism. It was evident that he did not wish to reply in the commonplace phraseology that everybody uses: \u201cOh, it was nothing, really,\u201d and so forth, when, to my question: \u201cWas it a good show?\u201d put with regard to an afternoon dance at his house to which I had been prevented from going, he replied in a level, careless tone, as if the dance had been given by some one else: \u201cWhy, yes, it was quite a good show, couldn\u2019t have been better. It was really charming!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat you have just told us interests me enormously,\u201d said Legrandin to Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cfor I was saying to myself only the other day that you shewed a marked likeness to him in the clear-cut turn of your speech, in a quality which I will venture to describe by two contradictory terms, monumental rapidity and immortal instantaneousness. I should have liked this afternoon to take down all the things you say; but I shall remember them. They are, in a phrase which comes, I think, from Joubert, friends of the memery. You have never read Joubert? Oh! he would have admired you so! I will take the liberty this evening of sending you a set of him, it is a privilege to make you a present of his mind. He had not your strength. But he had a great deal of charm all the same.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would have gone up to Legrandin at once and spoken to him, but he kept as far away from me as he could, no doubt in the hope that I might not overhear the stream of flattery which, with a remarkable felicity of expression, he kept pouring out, whatever the topic, to Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She shrugged her shoulders, smiling, as though he had been trying to make fun of her, and turned to the historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd this is the famous Marie de Rohan, Duchesse de Chevreuse, who was married first of all to M. de Luynes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear, speaking of Mme. de Luynes reminds me of Yolande; she came to me yesterday evening, and if I had known that you weren\u2019t engaged I\u2019d have sent round to ask you to come. Mme. Ristori turned up quite by chance, and recited some poems by Queen Carmen Sylva in the author\u2019s presence. It was too beautiful!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat treachery!\u201d thought Mme. de Villeparisis. \u201cOf course that was what she was whispering about the other day to Mme. de Beaulaincourt and Mme. de Chaponay. I had no engagement,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut I should not have come. I heard Ristori in her great days, she\u2019s a mere wreck now. Besides I detest Carmen Sylva\u2019s poetry. Ristori came here once, the Duchess of Aosta brought her, to recite a canto of the Inferno, by Dante. In that sort of thing she\u2019s incomparable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alix bore the blow without flinching. She remained marble. Her gaze was piercing and blank, her nose proudly arched. But the surface of one cheek was scaling. A faint, strange vegetation, green and pink, was invading her chin. Perhaps another winter would level her with the dust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow, sir, if you are fond of painting, look at the portrait of Mme, de Montmorency,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis said to Legrandin, to stop the flow of compliments which was beginning again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seizing her opportunity, while his back was turned, Mme. de Guermantes pointed to him, with an ironical, questioning look at her aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s M. Legrandin,\u201d murmured Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201che has a sister called Mme. de Cambremer, not that that conveys any more to you than it does to me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat! Oh, but I know her quite well!\u201d exclaimed Mme. de Guermantes, and put her hand over her lips. \u201cThat is to say, I don\u2019t know her, but for some reason or other Basin, who meets the husband heaven knows where, took it into his head to tell the wretched woman she might call on me. And she did. I can\u2019t tell you what it was like. She informed me that she had been to London, and gave me a complete catalogue of all the things in the British Museum. And this very day, the moment I leave your house, I\u2019m going, just as you see me now, to drop a card on the monster. And don\u2019t for a moment suppose that it\u2019s an easy thing to do. On the pretence that she\u2019s dying of some disease she\u2019s always at home, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you arrive at seven at night or nine in the morning, she\u2019s ready for you with a dish of strawberry tarts\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, but seriously, you know, she is a monstrosity,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes replied to a questioning glance from her aunt. \u201cShe\u2019s an impossible person, she talks about \u2018plumitives\u2019 and things like that.\u201d \u201cWhat does \u2018plumitive\u2019 mean?\u201d asked Mme. de Villeparisis. \u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest idea!\u201d cried the Duchess in mock indignation. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know. I don\u2019t speak that sort of language.\u201d And seeing that her aunt really did not know what a plumitive was, to give herself the satisfaction of shewing that she was a scholar as well as a purist, and to make fun of her aunt, now, after making fun of Mme. de Cambremer: \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d she said, with a half-laugh which the last traces of her pretended ill humour kept in check, \u201ceverybody knows what it means; a plumitive is a writer, a person who holds a pen. But it\u2019s a dreadful word. It\u2019s enough to make your wisdom teeth drop out. Nothing will ever make me use words like that\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd so that\u2019s the brother, is it? I hadn\u2019t realized that yet. But after all it\u2019s not inconceivable. She has the same doormat docility and the same mass of information like a circulating library. She\u2019s just as much of a flatterer as he is, and just as boring. Yes, I\u2019m beginning to see the family likeness now quite plainly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSit down, we\u2019re just going to take a dish of tea,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to her niece. \u201cHelp yourself; you don\u2019t want to look at the pictures of your great-grandmothers, you know them as well as I do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently Mme. de Villeparisis sat down again at her desk and went on with her painting. The rest of the party gathered round her, and I took the opportunity to go up to Legrandin and, seeing no harm myself in his presence in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room and never dreaming how much my words would at once hurt him and make him believe that I had deliberately intended to hurt him, say: \u201cWell, sir, I am almost excused for coming to a tea-party when I find you here too.\u201d M. Legrandin concluded from this speech (at least this was the opinion which he expressed of me a few days later) that I was a thoroughly spiteful little wretch who delighted only in doing mischief\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou might at least have the civility to begin by saying how d\u2019ye do to me,\u201d he replied, without offering me his hand and in a coarse and angry voice which I had never suspected him of possessing, a voice which bearing no traceable relation to what he ordinarily said did bear another more immediate and striking relation to something that he was feeling at the moment. What happens is that since we are determined always to keep our feelings to ourselves, we have never given any thought to the manner in which we should express them. And suddenly there is within us a strange and obscene animal making its voice heard, the tones of which may inspire as much terror in the listener who receives the involuntary elliptical irresistible communication of our defect or vice as would the sudden avowal indirectly and uncouthly proffered by a criminal who can no longer refrain from confessing a murder of which one had never imagined him to be guilty. I knew, of course, that idealism, even subjective idealism, did not prevent great philosophers from still having hearty appetites or from presenting themselves with untiring perseverance for election to the Academy. But really Legrandin had no occasion to remind people so often that he belonged to another planet when all his convulsive movements of anger or affability were governed by the desire to occupy a good position on this\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNaturally, when people pester me twenty times on end to go anywhere,\u201d he went on in lower tones, \u201calthough I am perfectly free to do what I choose, still I can\u2019t behave like an absolute boor.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes had sat down. Her name, accompanied as it was by her title, added to her corporeal dimensions the duchy which projected itself round about her and brought the shadowy, sun-splashed coolness of the woods of Guermantes into this drawing-room, to surround the tuffet on which she was sitting. I felt surprised only that the likeness of those woods was not more discernible on the face of the Duchess, about which there was nothing suggestive of vegetation, and at the most the ruddy discolouration of her cheeks \u2014 which ought rather, surely, to have been emblazoned with the name Guermantes \u2014 was the effect, but did not furnish a picture of long gallops in the open air. Later on, when she had ceased to interest me, I came to know many of the Duchess\u2019s peculiarities, notably (to speak for the moment only of that one of which I already at this time felt the charm though without yet being able to discover what it was) her eyes, in which was held captive as in a picture the blue sky of an afternoon in France, broadly expansive, bathed in light even when no sun shone; and a voice which one would have thought, from its first hoarse sounds, to be almost plebeian, through which there trailed, as over the steps of the church at Combray or the pastry-cook\u2019s in the square, the rich and lazy gold of a country sun. But on this first day I discerned nothing, the warmth of my attention volatilised at once the little that I might otherwise have been able to extract from her, in which I should have found some indication of the name Guermantes. In any case, I told myself that it was indeed she who was designated for all the world by the title Duchesse de Guermantes: the inconceivable life which that name signified, this body did indeed contain; it had just introduced that life into a crowd of different creatures, in this room which enclosed it on every side and on which it produced so violent a reaction that I thought I could see, where the extent of that mysterious life ceased, a fringe of effervescence outline its frontiers: round the circumference of the circle traced on the carpet by the balloon of her blue pekin skirt, and in the bright eyes of the Duchess at the point of intersection of the preoccupations, the memories, the incomprehensible, scornful, amused and curious thoughts which filled them from within and the outside images that were reflected on their surface. Perhaps I should have been not quite so deeply stirred had I met her at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s at an evening party, instead of seeing her thus on one of the Marquise\u2019s \u2018days,\u2019 at one of those tea-parties which are for women no more than a brief halt in the course of their afternoon\u2019s outing, when, keeping on the hats in which they have been driving through the streets, they waft into the close atmosphere of a drawing-room the quality of the fresh air outside, and give one a better view of Paris in the late afternoon than do the tall, open windows through which one can hear the bowling wheels of their victorias: Mme. de Guermantes wore a boating-hat trimmed with cornflowers, and what they recalled to me was not, among the tilled fields round Combray where I had so often gathered those flowers, on the slope adjoining the Tansonville hedge, the suns of bygone years; it was the scent and dust of twilight as they had been an hour ago, when Mme. de Guermantes drove through them, in the Rue de la Paix. With a smiling, disdainful, vague air, and a grimace on her pursed lips, with the point of her sunshade, as with the extreme tip of an antenna of her mysterious life, she was tracing circles on the carpet; then, with that indifferent attention which begins by eliminating every point of contact with what one is actually studying, her gaze fastened upon each of us in turn; then inspected the sofas and armchairs, but softened this time by that human sympathy which is aroused by the presence, however insignificant, of a thing one knows, a thing that is almost a person; these pieces of furniture were not like us, they belonged vaguely to her world, they were bound up with the life of her aunt; then from the Beauvais furniture her gaze was carried back to the person sitting on it, and resumed then the same air of perspicacity and that same disapproval which the respect that Mme. de Guermantes felt for her aunt would have prevented her from expressing in words, but which she would obviously have felt had she discovered on the chairs, instead of our presence, that of a spot of grease or a layer of dust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That admirable writer G\u2014\u2014-entered the room; he had come to pay a call on Mme. de Villeparisis which he regarded as a tiresome duty. The Duchess, although delighted to see him again, gave him no sign of welcome, but instinctively he made straight for her, the charm that she possessed, her tact, her simplicity making him look upon her as a woman of exceptional intelligence. He was bound, moreover, in common politeness to go and talk to her, for, since he was a pleasant and a distinguished man, Mme. de Guermantes frequently invited him to luncheon even when there were only her husband and herself besides, or in the autumn to Guermantes, making use of this intimacy to have him to dinner occasionally with Royalties who were curious to meet him. For the Duchess liked to entertain certain eminent men, on condition always that they were bachelors, a condition which, even when married, they invariably fulfilled for her, for, as their wives, who were bound to be more or less common, would have been a blot on a drawing-room in which there were never any but the most fashionable beauties in Paris, it was always without them that their husbands were invited; and the Duke, to avoid hurting any possible susceptibility, used to explain to these involuntary widowers that the Duchess never had women in the house, could not endure feminine society, almost as though this had been under doctor\u2019s orders, and as be might have said that she could not stay in a room in which there were smells, or eat salt food, or travel with her back to the engine, or wear stays. It was true that these eminent men used to see at the Guermantes\u2019 the Princesse de Parme, the Princesse de Sagan (whom Fran\u00e7oise, hearing her constantly mentioned, had taken to calling, in the belief that this feminine, ending was required by the laws of accidence, \u2018the Sagante\u2019), and plenty more, but their presence was accounted for by the explanation that they were relatives, or such very old friends that it was impossible to exclude them. Whether or not they were convinced by the explanations which the Due de Guermantes had given of the singular malady that made it impossible for the Duchess to associate with other women, the great men duly transmitted them to their wives. Some of these thought that this malady was only an excuse to cloak her jealousy, because the Duchess wished to reign alone over a court of worshippers. Others more simple still thought that perhaps the Duchess had some peculiar habit, a scandalous past it might be, that women did not care to go to her house and that she gave the name of a whim to what was stern necessity. The better among them, hearing their husbands expatiate on the Duchess\u2019s marvellous brain, assumed that She must be so far superior to the rest of womankind that she found their Society boring since they could not talk intelligently about anything. And it was true that the Duchess was bored by other women, if their princely rank did not render them specially interesting. But the excluded wives were mistaken when they imagined that she chose to entertain men alone in order to be free to discuss with them literature, science and philosophy. For she never referred to these, at least with the great intellectuals. If, by virtue of a family tradition such as makes the daughters of great soldiers preserve, in the midst of their most frivolous distractions a respect for military matters, she, the granddaughter of women who had been on terms of friendship with Thiers, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e and Augier, felt that a place must always be kept in her drawing-room for men of intellect, she had on the other hand derived from the manner, at once condescending and intimate, in which those famous men had been received at Guermantes the foible of looking on men of talent as family friends whose talent does not dazzle one, to whom one does not speak of their work, and who would not be at all interested if one did. Moreover the type of mind illustrated by M\u00e9rim\u00e9e and Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy, which was hers also, led her by reaction from the verbal sentimentality of an earlier generation to a style in conversation that rejects everything to do with fine language and the expression of lofty thoughts, so that she made it a sort of element of good breeding when she was with a poet or a musician to talk only of the food that they were eating or the game of cards to which they would afterwards sit down. This abstention had, on a third person not conversant with her ways, a disturbing effect which amounted to mystification. Mme. de Guermantes having asked him whether it would amuse him to come to luncheon to meet this or that famous poet, devoured by curiosity he would arrive at the appointed hour. The Duchess was talking to the poet about the weather. They sat down to luncheon. \u201cDo you like this way of doing eggs?\u201d she asked the poet. On hearing his approval, which she shared, for everything in her own house appeared to her exquisite, including a horrible cider which she imported from Guermantes: \u201cGive Monsieur some more eggs,\u201d she would tell the butler, while the anxious fellow-guest sat waiting for what must surely have been the object of the party, since they had arranged to meet, in spite of every sort of difficulty, before the Duchess, the poet and he himself left Paris. But the meal went on, one after another the courses were cleared away, not without having first provided Mme. de Guermantes with opportunities for clever witticisms or apt stories. Meanwhile the poet went on eating, and neither Duke nor Duchess shewed any sign of remembering that he was a poet. And presently the luncheon came to an end and the party broke up, without a word having been said about the poetry which, for all that, everyone admired but to which, by a reserve analogous to that of which Swann had given me a foretaste, no one might refer. This reserve was simply a matter of good form. But for the fellow-guest, if he thought at all about the matter, there was something strangely melancholy about it all, and these meals in the Guermantes household made him think of the hours which timid lovers often spend together in talking trivialities until it is time to part, without \u2014 whether from shyness, from audacity or from awkwardness \u2014 the great secret which they would have been happier had they confessed ever succeeding in passing from their hearts to their lips. It must, however, be added that this silence with regard to the serious matters which one was always waiting in vain to see approached, if it might pass as characteristic of the Duchess, was by no means constant with her. Mme. de Guermantes had spent her girlhood in a society somewhat different, equally aristocratic but less brilliant and above all less futile than that in which she now lived, and one of wide culture. It had left beneath her present frivolity a sort of bed-rock of greater solidity, invisibly nutritious, to which indeed the Duchess would repair in search (very rarely, though, for she detested pedantry) of some quotation from Victor Hugo or Lamartine which, extremely appropriate, uttered with a look of true feeling from her fine eyes, never failed to surprise and charm her audience. Sometimes, even, without any pretence of authority, pertinently and quite simply, she would give some dramatist and Academician a piece of sage advice, would make him modify a situation or alter an ending\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If, in the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, just as in the church at Combray, on the day of Mlle. Percepied\u2019s wedding, I had difficulty in discovering, in the handsome, too human face of Mme. de Guermantes the unknown element of her name, I at least thought that, when she spoke, her conversation, profound, mysterious, would have a strangeness as of a mediaeval tapestry or a gothic window. But in order that I should not be disappointed by the words which I should hear uttered by a person who called herself Mme. de Guermantes, even if I had not been in love with her, it would not have sufficed that those words were fine, beautiful and profound, they would have had to reflect that amaranthine colour of the closing syllable of her name, that colour which I had on my first sight of her been disappointed not to find in her person and had driven to take refuge in her mind. Of course I had already heard Mme. de Villeparisis, Saint-Loup, people whose intelligence was in no way extraordinary, pronounce without any precaution this name Guermantes, simply as that of a person who was coming to see them or with whom they had promised to dine, without seeming to feel that there were latent in her name the glow of yellowing woods in autumn and a whole mysterious tract of country. But this must have been an affectation on their part, as when the classic poets give us no warning of the profound purpose which they had, all the same, in writing, an affectation which I myself also strove to imitate, saying in the most natural tone: \u201cThe Duchesse de Guermantes,\u201d as though it were a name that was just like other names. And then everybody assured me that she was a highly intelligent woman, a clever talker, that she was one of a little group of most interesting people: words which became accomplices of my dream. For when they spoke of an intelligent group, of clever talk, it was not at all the sort of intelligence that I knew that I imagined, not even that of the greatest minds, it was not at all with men like Bergotte that I peopled this group. No, by intelligence I understood an ineffable faculty gilded by the sun, impregnated with a sylvan coolness. Indeed, had she made the most intelligent remarks (in the sense in which I understood the word when it was used of a philosopher or critic), Mme. de Guermantes would perhaps have disappointed even more keenly my expectation of so special a faculty than if, in the course of a trivial conversation, she had confined herself to discussing kitchen recipes or the furnishing of a country house, to mentioning the names of neighbours and relatives of her own, which would have given me a picture of her life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI thought I should find Basin here, he was meaning to come and see you to-day,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes to her aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI haven\u2019t set eyes on your husband for some days,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis in a somewhat nettled tone. \u201cIn fact, I haven\u2019t seen him.\u2019 well, I have seen him once, perhaps \u2014 since that charming joke he played on me of making my servants announce him as the Queen of Sweden.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes formed a smile by contracting the corners of her mouth as though she were biting her veil\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe met her at dinner last night at Blanche Leroi\u2019s. You wouldn\u2019t know her now, she\u2019s positively enormous; I\u2019m sure she must have something the matter with her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just telling these gentlemen that you said she looked like a frog,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes uttered a sort of raucous sound intended to signify that she acknowledged the compliment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t remember making such a charming comparison, but if she was one before, now she\u2019s the frog that has succeeded in swelling to the size of the ox. Or rather, it isn\u2019t quite that, because all her swelling is concentrated in front of her waist, she\u2019s more like a frog in an interesting condition.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, that is quite clever,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis, secretly proud that her guests should be witnessing this display of her niece\u2019s wit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is purely arbitrary, though,\u201d answered Mme. de Guermantes, ironically detaching this selected epithet, as Swann would have done, \u201cfor I must admit I never saw a frog in the family way. Anyhow, the frog in question, who, by the way, is not asking for a king, for I never saw her so skittish as she\u2019s been since her husband died, is coming to dine with us one day next week. I promised I\u2019d let you know in good time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis gave vent to a confused growl, from which emerged: \u201cI know she was dining with the Mecklenburgs the night before last. Hannibal de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 was there. He came and told me about it, and was quite amusing, I must say.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere was a man there who\u2019s a great deal wittier than Babal,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes who, in view of her close friendship wih M. de Br\u00e9\u00e0ut\u00e9-Consalvi, felt that she must advertise their intimacy by the use of this abbreviation. \u201cI mean M. Bergotte.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had never imagined that Bergotte could be regarded as witty; in fact, I thought of him always as mingling with the intellectual section of humanity, that is to say infinitely remote from that mysterious realm of which I had caught a glimpse through the purple hangings of a theatre box, behind which, making the Duchess smile, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 was holding with her, in the language of the gods, that unimaginable thing, a conversation between people of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. I was stupefied to see the balance upset, and Bergotte rise above M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. But above all I was dismayed to think that I had avoided Bergotte on the evening of Ph\u00e8dre, that I had not gone up and spoken to him, when I heard Mme. de Guermantes say to Mme. de Villeparisis:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe is the only person I have any wish to know,\u201d went on the Duchess, in whom one could always, as at the turn of a mental tide, see the flow of curiosity with regard to well-known intellectuals sweep over the ebb of her aristocratic snobbishness. \u201cIt would be such a pleasure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The presence of Bergotte by my side, which it would have been so easy for we to secure but which I had thought liable to give Mme. de Guermantes a bad impression of myself, would no doubt, on the contrary, have had the result that she would have signalled to me to join her in her box, and would have invited me to bring the eminent writer, one day, to luncheon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI gather that he didn\u2019t behave very well, he was presented to M. de Cobourg, and never uttered a word to him,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, dwelling on this odd characteristic as she might have recounted that a Chinaman had blown his nose on a sheet of paper. \u201cHe never once said \u2018Monseigneur\u2019 to him,\u201d she added, with an air of amusement at this detail, as important to her mind as the refusal of a Protestant, during an audience with the Pope, to go on his knees before his Holiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interested by these idiosyncrasies of Bergotte, she did not, however, appear to consider them reprehensible, and seemed rather to find a certain merit in them, though she would have been put to it to say of what sort. Despite this unusual mode of appreciating Bergotte\u2019s originality, it was a fact which I was later oh not to regard as wholly negligible that Mme. de Guermantes, greatly to the surprise of many of her friends, did consider Bergotte more witty than M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. Thus it is that such judgments, subversive, isolated, and yet after all just, are delivered in the world of fashion by those rare minds that are superior to the rest. And they sketch then the first rough outlines of the hierarchy of values as the next generation will establish it, instead of abiding eternally by the old standards\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Comte d\u2019Argencourt, Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires at the Belgian Legation and a remote connexion of Mme. de Villeparisis, came limping in, followed presently by two young men, the Baron de Guermantes and H. H. the Due de Ch\u00e2tellerault, whom Mme. de Guermantes greeted with: \u201cHow d\u2019ye do, young Ch\u00e2tellerault,\u201d in a careless tone and without moving from her tuffet, for she was a great friend of the young Duke\u2019s mother, which had given him a deep and lifelong respect for her. Tall, slender, with golden hair and sunny complexions, thoroughly of the Guermantes type, these two young men looked like a condensation of the light of the spring evening which was flooding the spacious room. Following a custom which was the fashion at that time they laid their silk hats on the floor, by their feet. The historian of the Fronde thought that they were embarrassed, like a peasant coming into the mayor\u2019s office and not knowing what to do with his hat. Feeling that he ought in charity to come to the rescue of the awkwardness and timidity which he ascribed to them:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t leave them on the floor, they\u2019ll be trodden on.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A glance from the Baron de Guermantes, tilting the plane of his pupils, shot suddenly from them a wave of pure and piercing azure which froze the well-meaning historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat is that person\u2019s name?\u201d I was asked by the Baron, who had just been introduced to me by Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cM. Pierre,\u201d I whispered\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPierre what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPierre: it\u2019s his name, he\u2019s a historian, a most distinguished man.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReally? You don\u2019t say so.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, it\u2019s a new fashion with these young men to put their hats on the floor,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis explained. \u201cI\u2019m like you, I can never get used to it. Still, it\u2019s better than my nephew Robert, who always leaves his in the hall. I tell him when I see him come in that he looks just like a clock-maker, and I ask him if he\u2019s come to wind the clocks.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou were speaking just now, Madame la Marquise, of M. Mole\u2019s hat; we shall soon be able, like Aristotle, to compile a chapter on hats,\u201d said the historian of the Fronde, somewhat reassured by Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s intervention, but in so faint a voice that no one but myself overheard him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe really is astonishing, the little Duchess,\u201d said M. d\u2019Argencourt, pointing to Mme. de Guermantes who was talking to G\u2014\u2014. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a famous man in the room you\u2019re sure to find him sitting with her. Evidently that must be the lion of the party over there. It can\u2019t always be M. de Borelli, of course, or M. Schlumberger or M. d\u2019Avenel. But then it\u2019s bound to be M. Pierre Loti or M. Edmond Rostand. Yesterday evening at the Doudeauvilles\u2019, where by the way she was looking splendid in her emerald tiara and a pink dress with a long train, she had M. Deschanel on one side and the German Ambassador on the other: she was holding forth to them about China; the general public, at a respectful distance where they couldn\u2019t hear what was being said, were wondering whether there wasn\u2019t going to be war. Really, you\u2019d have said she was a Queen, holding her circle.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everyone had gathered round Mme. de Villeparisis to watch her painting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThose flowers are a truly celestial pink,\u201d said Legrandin, \u201cI should say sky-pink. For there is such a thing as sky-pink just as there is sky-blue. But,\u201d he lowered his voice in the hope that he would not be heard by anyone but the Marquise, \u201cI think I shall still give my vote to the silky, living flesh tint of your rendering of them. You leave Pisanello and Van Huysun a long way behind, with their laborious, dead herbals.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An artist, however modest, is always willing to hear himself preferred to his rivals, and tries only to see that justice is done them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat makes you think that is that they painted the flowers of their period, which we don\u2019t have now, but they did it with great skill.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! The flowers of their period! That is a most ingenious theory,\u201d exclaimed Legrandin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI see you\u2019re painting some fine cherry blossoms \u2014 or are they may-flowers?\u201d began the historian of the Fronde, not without hesitation as to the flower, but with a note of confidence in his voice, for he was beginning to forget the incident of the hats\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; they\u2019re apple blossom,\u201d said the Duchesse de Guermantes, addressing her aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! I see you\u2019re a good countrywoman like me; you can tell one flower from another.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy yes, so they are! But I thought the season for apple blossom was over now,\u201d said the historian, seeking wildly to cover his mistake\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh dear, no; far from it, it\u2019s not out yet; the trees won\u2019t be in blossom for another fortnight, not for three weeks perhaps,\u201d said the librarian who, since he helped with the management of Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s estates, was better informed upon country matters\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt least three weeks,\u201d put in the Duchess; \u201ceven round Paris, where they\u2019re very far forward. Down in Normandy, don\u2019t you know, at his father\u2019s place,\u201d she went on, pointing to the young Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault, \u201cwhere they have some splendid apple trees close to the seashore, like a Japanese screen, they\u2019re never really pink until after the twentieth of May.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI never see them,\u201d said the young Duke, \u201cbecause they give me hay fever. Such a bore.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHay fever? I never heard of that before,\u201d said the historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s the fashionable complaint just now,\u201d the librarian informed him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat all depends, you won\u2019t get it at all, probably, if it\u2019s a good year for apples. You know Le Normand\u2019s saying: \u2018When it\u2019s a good year for apples . . . \u2019,\u201d put in M. d\u2019Argencourt who, not being really French, was always trying to give himself a Parisian air\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re quite right,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis told her niece, \u201cthese are from the South. It was a florist who sent them round and asked me to accept them as a present. You\u2019re surprised, I dare say, Monsieur Valm\u00e8re,\u201d she turned to the librarian, \u201cthat a florist should make me a present of apple blossom. Well, I may be an old woman, but I\u2019m not quite on the shelf yet, I have still a few friends,\u201d she went on with a smile that might have been taken as a sign of her simple nature but meant rather, I could not help feeling, that she thought it effective to pride herself on the friendship of a mere florist when she moved in such distinguished circles\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch rose and went over to look at the flowers which Mme. de Villeparisis was painting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNever mind, Marquise,\u201d said the historian, sitting down again, \u201ceven though we should have another of those Revolutions which have stained so many pages of our history with blood \u2014 and, upon my soul, in these days one can never tell,\u201d he added, with a circular and circumspect glance, as though to make sure that there was no \u2018disaffected\u2019 person in the room, though he had not the least suspicion that there actually was, \u201cwith a talent like yours and your five languages you would be certain to get on all right.\u201d The historian of the Fronde was feeling quite refreshed, for he had forgotten his insomnia. But he suddenly remembered that he had not slept for the last six nights, whereupon a crushing weariness, born of his mind, paralysed his limbs, made him bow his shoulders, and his melancholy face began to droop like an old man\u2019s\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch tried to express his admiration in an appropriate gesture, but only succeeded in knocking over with his elbow the glass containing the spray of apple blossom, and all the water was spilled on the carpet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReally, you have the fingers of a fairy,\u201d went on (to the Marquise) the historian who, having his back turned to me at that moment, had not noticed Bloch\u2019s clumsiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Bloch took this for a sneer at himself, and to cover his shame in insolence retorted: \u201cIt\u2019s not of the slightest importance; I\u2019m not wet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis rang the bell and a footman came to wipe the carpet and pick up the fragments of glass. She invited the two young men to her theatricals, and also Mme. de Guermantes, with the injunction:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRemember to tell Gis\u00e8le and Berthe\u201d (the Duchesses d\u2019Auberjon and de Portefin) \u201cto be here a little before two to help me,\u201d as she might have told the hired waiters to come early to arrange the tables\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She treated her princely relatives, as she treated M. de Norpois, without any of the little courtesies which she shewed to the historian, Cottard, Bloch and myself, and they seemed to have no interest for her beyond the possibility of serving them up as food for our social curiosity. This was because she knew that she need not put herself out to entertain people for whom she was not a more or less brilliant woman but the touchy old sister \u2014 who needed and received tactful handling \u2014 of their father or uncle. There would have been no object in her trying to shine before them, she could never have deceived them as to the strength and weakness of her position, for they knew (none so well) her whole history and respected the illustrious race from which she sprang. But, above all, they had ceased to be anything more for her than a dead stock which would not bear fruit again, they would not let her know their new friends, or share their pleasures. She could obtain from them only their occasional presence, or the possibility of speaking of them, at her five o\u2019clock tea-parties as, later on, in her Memoirs, of which these parties were only a sort of rehearsal, a preliminary reading aloud of the manuscript before a selected audience. And the society which all these noble kinsmen and kinswomen served to interest, to dazzle, to enthral, the society of the Cottards, of the Blochs, of the dramatists who were in the public eye at the moment, of the historians of the Fronde and such matters; it was in this society that there existed for Mme. de Villeparisis \u2014 failing that section of the fashionable world which did not call upon her \u2014 the movement, the novelty, all the entertainment of life, it was from people like these that she was able to derive social benefits (which made it well worth her while to let them meet, now and then, though without ever coming to know her, the Duchesse de Guermantes), dinners with remarkable men whose work had interested her, a light opera or a pantomime staged complete by its author in her drawing-room, boxes for interesting shows. Bloch got up to go. He had said aloud that the incident of the broken flower-glass was of no importance, but what he said to himself was different, more different still what he thought: \u201cIf people can\u2019t train their servants to put flowers where they won\u2019t be knocked over and wet their guests and probably cut their hands, it\u2019s much better not to go in for such luxuries,\u201d he muttered angrily. He was one of those susceptible, highly strung persons who cannot bear to think of themselves as having made a blunder which, though they do not admit even to themselves that they have made it, is enough to spoil their whole day. In a black rage, he was just making up his mind never to go into society again. He had reached the point at which some distraction was imperative. Fortunately in another minute Mme. de Villeparisis was to press him to stay. Either because she was aware of the general feeling among her friends, and had noticed the tide of anti-semitism that was beginning to rise, or simply from carelessness, she had not introduced him to any of the people in the room. He, however, being little used to society, felt bound before leaving the room to take leave of them all, to shew his manners, but without any friendliness; he lowered his head several times, buried his bearded chin in his collar, scrutinised each of the party in turn through his glasses with a cold, dissatisfied glare. But Mme. de Villeparisis stopped him; she had still to discuss with him the little play which was to be performed in her house, and also she did not wish him to leave before he had had the pleasure of meeting M. de Norpois (whose failure to appear puzzled her), although as an inducement to Bloch this introduction was quite superfluous, he having already decided to persuade the two actresses whose names he had mentioned to her to come and sing for nothing in the Marquise\u2019s drawing-room, to enhance their own reputations, at one of those parties to which all that was best and noblest in Europe thronged. He had even offered her, in addition, a tragic actress \u2018with pure eyes, fair as Hera,\u2019 who would recite lyrical prose with a sense of plastic beauty. But On hearing this lady\u2019s name Mme. de Villeparisis had declined, for it was that of Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have better news,\u201d she murmured in my ear. \u201cI really believe he\u2019s quite cooled off now, and that before very long they\u2019ll be parted \u2014 in spite of an officer who has played an abominable part in the whole business,\u201d she added. For Robert\u2019s family were beginning to look with a deadly hatred on M. de Borodino, who had given him leave, at the hairdresser\u2019s instance, to go to Bruges, and accused him of giving countenance to an infamous intrigue. \u201cIt\u2019s really too bad of him,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis with that virtuous accent common to all the Guermantes, even the most depraved. \u201cToo, too bad,\u201d she repeated, giving the word a trio of t\u2019s. One felt that she had no doubt of the Prince\u2019s being present at all their orgies. But, as kindness of heart was the old lady\u2019s dominant quality, her expression of frowning severity towards the horrible captain, whose name she articulated with an ironical emphasis: \u201cThe Prince de Borodino!\u201d\u2014 speaking as a woman for whom the Empire simply did not count, melted into a gentle smile at myself with a mechanical twitch of the eyelid indicating a vague understanding between us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have a great admiration for de Saint-Loup-en-Bray,\u201d said Bloch, \u201cdirty dog as he is, because he\u2019s so extremely well-bred. I have a great admiration, not for him but for well-bred people, they\u2019re so rare,\u201d he went on, without thinking, since he was himself so extremely ill-bred, what offence his words were giving. \u201cI will give you an example which I consider most striking of his perfect breeding. I met him once with a young gentleman just as he was about to spring into his wheeled chariot, after he himself had buckled their splendid harness on a pair of steeds, whose mangers were heaped with oats and barley, who had no need of the flashing whip to urge them on. He introduced us, but I did not catch the gentleman\u2019s name; one never does catch people\u2019s names when one\u2019s introduced to them,\u201d he explained with a laugh, this being one of his father\u2019s witticisms. \u201cDe Saint-Loup-en-Bray was perfectly calm, made no fuss about the young gentleman, seemed absolutely at his ease. Well, I found out, by pure chance, a day or two later, that the young gentleman was the son of Sir Rufus Israels!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The end of this story sounded less shocking than its preface, for it remained quite incomprehensible to everyone in the room. The fact was that Sir Rufus Israels, who seemed to Bloch and his father an almost royal personage before whom Saint-Loup ought to tremble, was in the eyes of the Guermantes world a foreign upstart, tolerated in society, on whose friendship nobody would ever have dreamed of priding himself, far from it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI learned this,\u201d Bloch informed us, \u201cfrom the person who holds Sir Rufus\u2019s power of attorney; he is a friend of my father, and quite an extraordinary man. Oh, an absolutely wonderful individual,\u201d he assured us with that affirmative energy, that note of enthusiasm which one puts only into those convictions that did not originate with oneself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me,\u201d Bloch went on, lowering his voice, to myself, \u201chow much do you suppose Saint-Loup has? Not that it matters to me in the least, you quite understand, don\u2019t you. I\u2019m interested from the Balzacian point of view. You don\u2019t happen to know what it\u2019s in, French stocks, foreign stocks, or land or what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could give him no information whatsoever. Suddenly raising his voice, Bloch asked if he might open the windows, and without waiting for an answer, went across the room to do so. Mme. de Villeparisis protested that he must not, that she had a cold. \u201cOf course, if it\u2019s bad for you!\u201d Bloch was downcast. \u201cBut you can\u2019t say it\u2019s not hot in here.\u201d And breaking into a laugh he put into the gaze with which he swept the room an appeal for support against Mme. de Villeparisis. He received none, from these well-bred people. His blazing eyes, having failed to seduce any of the guests from their allegiance, faded with resignation to their normal gravity of expression; he acknowledged his defeat with: \u201cWhat\u2019s the temperature? Seventy-two, at least, I should say. I\u2019m not surprised. I\u2019m simply dripping. And I have not, like the sage Antenor, son of the river Aipheus, the power to plunge myself in the paternal wave to stanch my sweat before laying my body in a bath of polished marble and anointing my limbs with fragrant oils.\u201d And with that need which people feel to outline for the use of others medical theories the application of which would be beneficial to their own health: \u201cWell, if you believe it\u2019s good for you! I must say, I think you\u2019re quite wrong. It\u2019s exactly what gives you your cold.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch was overjoyed at the idea of meeting M. de Norpois. He would like, he told us, to get him to talk about the Dreyfus case. \u201cThere\u2019s a mentality at work there which I don\u2019t altogether understand, and it would be quite sensational to get an interview out of this eminent diplomat,\u201d he said in a tone of sarcasm, so as not to appear to be rating himself below the Ambassador\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis was sorry that he had said this so loud, but minded less when she saw that the librarian, whose strong Nationalist views kept her, so to speak, on leash, was too far off to have overheard. She was more shocked to hear Bloch, led on by that demon of ill-breeding which made him permanently blind to the consequences of what he said, inquiring, with a laugh at the paternal pleasantry: \u201cHaven\u2019t I read a learned treatise by him in which he sets forth a string of irrefutable arguments to prove that the Japanese war was bound to end in a Russian victory and a Japanese defeat? He\u2019s fairly paralytic now, isn\u2019t he? I\u2019m sure he\u2019s the old boy I\u2019ve seen taking aim at his chair before sliding across the room to it, as if he was on wheels.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, dear, no! Not in the least like that! Just wait a minute,\u201d the Marquise went on, \u201cI don\u2019t know what he can be doing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She rang the bell and, when the servant had appeared, as she made no secret, and indeed liked to advertise the fact that her old friend spent the greater part of his time in her house: \u201cGo and tell M. de Norpois to come in\u201d she ordered him, \u201che is sorting some papers in my library; he said he would be twenty minutes, and I\u2019ve been waiting now for an hour and three-quarters. He will tell you about the Dreyfus case, anything you want to know,\u201d she said gruffly to Bloch. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t approve much of the way things are going.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For M. de Norpois was not on good terms with the Government of the day, and Mme. de Villeparisis, although he had never taken the liberty of bringing any actual Ministers to her house (she still preserved all the unapproachable dignity of a great lady, and remained outside and above the political relations which he was obliged to cultivate), was kept well informed by him of everything that went on. Then, too, the politicians of the day would never have dared to ask M. de Norpois to introduce them to Mme. de Villeparisis. But several of them had gone down to see him at her house in the country when they needed his advice or help at critical conjectures. One knew the address. One went to the house. One did not see its mistress. But at dinner that evening she would say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hear they\u2019ve been down here bothering you. I trust things are going better.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are not in a hurry?\u201d she now asked Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, not at all. I wanted to go because I am not very well; in fact there is some talk of my taking a cure at Vichy for my biliary ducts,\u201d he explained, articulating the last words with a fiendish irony\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, that\u2019s where my nephew Ch\u00e2tellerault\u2019s got to go, you must fix it up together. Is he still in the room? He\u2019s a nice boy, you know,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis, and may quite well have meant what she said, feeling that two people whom she knew had no reason not to be friends with each other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, I dare say he wouldn\u2019t care about that \u2014 I don\u2019t really know him \u2014 at least I barely know him. He is sitting over there,\u201d stammered Bloch in ecstasy of confusion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The butler could not have delivered his mistress\u2019s message properly, for M. de Norpois, to make believe that he had just come in from the street, and had not yet seen his hostess, had picked up the first hat that he had found in the hall, and came forward to kiss Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s hand with great ceremony, asking after her health with all the interest that people shew after a long separation. He was not aware that the Marquise had already destroyed any semblance of reality in this charade, which she cut short by taking M. de Norpois and Bloch into an adjoining room. Bloch, who had observed all the courtesy that was being shewn to a person whom he had not yet discovered to be M. de Norpois, had said to me, trying to seem at his ease: \u201cWho is that old idiot?\u201d Perhaps, too, all this bowing and scraping by M. de Norpois had really shocked the better element in Bloch\u2019s nature, the freer and more straightforward manners of a younger generation, and he was partly sincere in condemning it as absurd. However that might be, it ceased to appear absurd, and indeed delighted him the moment it was himself, Bloch, to whom the salutations were addressed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMonsieur l\u2019Ambassadeur,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cI should like you to know this gentleman. Monsieur Bloch, Monsieur le Marquis de Norpois.\u201d She made a point, despite her casual usage of M. de Norpois, of addressing him always as \u201cMonsieur l\u2019Ambassadeur,\u201d as a social convention as well as from an exaggerated respect for his Ambassadorial rank, a respect which the Marquis had inculcated in her, and also with an instinctive application to him of the special manner, less familiar and more ceremonious, in relation to one particular man \u2014 which, in the house of a distinguished woman, in contrast to the liberties that she takes with her other guests, marks that man out instantly as her lover\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois drowned his azure gaze in his white beard, bent his tall body deep down as though he were bowing before all the famous and (to him) imposing connotations of the name Bloch, and murmured: \u201cI am delighted . . . \u201d whereat his young listener, moved, but feeling that the illustrious diplomat was going too far, hastened to correct him, saying: \u201cNot at all! On the contrary, it is I who am delighted.\u201d But this ceremony, which M. de Norpois, in his friendship for Mme. de Villeparisis, repeated for the benefit of every fresh person that his old friend introduced to him, did not seem to her adequate to the deserts of Bloch, to whom she said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust ask him anything you want to know; take him into the other room if it\u2019s more convenient; he will be delighted to talk to you. I think you wished to speak to him about the Dreyfus case,\u201d she went on, no more considering whether this would suit M. de Norpois than she would have thought of asking leave of the Duchesse de Montmorency\u2019s portrait before having it lighted up for the historian, or of the tea before pouring it into a cup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou must speak loud,\u201d she warned Bloch, \u201che\u2019s a little deaf, but he will tell you anything you want to know; he knew Bismarck very well, and Cavour. That is so, isn\u2019t it;\u201d she raised her voice, \u201cyou knew Bismarck well?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you got anything on the stocks?\u201d M. de Norpois asked me with a knowing air as he shook my hand warmly. I took the opportunity to relieve him politely of the hat which he had felt obliged to bring ceremonially into the room, for I saw that it was my own which he had inadvertently taken. \u201cYou shewed me a somewhat laboured little thing in which you went in for a good deal of hair-splitting. I gave you my opinion quite frankly; what you had written was literally not worth the trouble of putting it on paper. Are you thinking of letting us have anything else? You were greatly smitten with Bergotte, if I remember rightly.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not to say anything against Bergotte,\u201d put in the Duchess. \u201cI don\u2019t dispute his talent as a painter; no one would, Duchess. He understands all about etching, if not brush-work on a large scale like M. Cherbuliez. But it seems to me that in these days we have a tendency to confuse the arts, and forget that the novelist\u2019s business is rather to weave a plot and edify his readers than to fiddle away at producing a frontispiece or tailpiece in drypoint. I shall be seeing your father on Sunday at our good friend A. J.\u2018s,\u201d he went on, turning again to myself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had hoped for a moment, when I saw him talking to Mme. de Guermantes, that he would perhaps afford me, for getting myself asked to her house, the help he had refused me for getting to Mme. Swann\u2019s. \u201cAnother of my great favourites,\u201d I told him, \u201cis Elstir. It seems the Duchesse de Guermantes has some wonderful examples of his work, particularly that admirable Bunch of Radishes which I remember at the Exhibition and should so much like to see again; what a masterpiece that is!\u201d And indeed, if I had been a prominent person and had been asked to state what picture I liked best, I should have named this Bunch of Radishes. \u201cA masterpiece?\u201d cried M. de Norpois with a surprised and reproachful air. \u201cIt makes no pretence of being even a picture, it is merely a sketch.\u201d (He was right.) \u201cIf you label a clever little thing of that sort \u2018masterpiece,\u2019 what have you got to say about H\u00e9bert\u2019s Virgin or Dagnan-Bouveret?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI heard you refusing to let him bring Robert\u2019s woman,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes to her aunt, after Bloch had taken the Ambassador aside. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll miss much, she\u2019s a perfect horror, as you know, without a vestige of talent, and besides she\u2019s grotesquely ugly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you mean to say, you know her, Duchess?\u201d asked M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, didn\u2019t you know that she performed in my house before the whole of Paris, not that that\u2019s anything for me to be proud of,\u201d explained Mme. de Guermantes with a laugh, glad nevertheless, since the actress was under discussion, to let it be known that she herself had had the first fruits of her foolishness. \u201cHallo, I suppose I ought to be going now,\u201d she added, without moving\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had just seen her husband enter the room, and these words were an allusion to the absurdity of their appearing to be paying a call together, like a newly married couple, rather than to the often strained relations that existed between her and the enormous fellow she had married, who, despite his increasing years, still led the life of a gay bachelor. Ranging over the considerable party that was gathered round the tea-table the genial, cynical gaze \u2014 dazzled a little by the brightness of the setting sun \u2014 of the little round pupils lodged in the exact centre of his eyes, like the \u2018bulls\u2019 which \u2018the excellent marksman that he was could always hit with such perfect aim and precision, the Duke came forward with a bewildered cautious slowness as though, alarmed by so brilliant a gathering, he was afraid of treading on ladies\u2019 skirts and interrupting conversations. A permanent smile \u2014 suggesting a \u2018Good King of Yvetot\u2019\u2014 slightly pompous, a half-open hand floating like a shark\u2019s fin by his side, which he allowed to be vaguely clasped by his old friends and by the strangers who were introduced to him, enabled him, without his having to make a single movement, or to interrupt his genial, lazy, royal progress, to reward the assiduity of them all by simply murmuring: \u201cHow do, my boy; how do, my dear friend; charmed, Monsieur Bloch; how do, Argencourt;\u201d and, on coming to myself, who was the most highly favoured, when he had been told my name: \u201cHow do, my young neighbour, how\u2019s your father? What a splendid fellow he is!\u201d He made no great demonstration except to Mme. de Villeparisis, who gave him good-day with a nod of her head, drawing one hand from a pocket of her little apron\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Being formidably rich in a world where everyone was steadily growing poorer, and having secured the permanent attachment to his person of the idea of this enormous fortune, he displayed all the vanity of the great nobleman reinforced by that of the man of means, the refinement and breeding of the former just managing to control the latter\u2019s self-sufficiency. One could understand, moreover, that his success with women, which made his wife so unhappy, was not due merely to his name and fortune, for he was still extremely good looking, and his profile retained the purity, the firmness of outline of a Greek god\u2019s\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you mean to tell me she performed in your house?\u201d M. d\u2019Argencourt asked the Duchess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, don\u2019t you see, she came to recite, with a bunch of lilies in her hand, and more lilies on her dress.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes shared her aunt\u2019s affectation of pronouncing certain words in an exceedingly rustic fashion, but never rolled her r\u2019s like Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before M. de Norpois, under constraint from his hostess, had taken Bloch into the little recess where they could talk more freely, I went up to the old diplomat for a moment and put in a word about my father\u2019s Academic chair. He tried first of all to postpone the conversation to another day. I pointed out that I was going to Balbec. \u201cWhat? Going again to Balbec? Why, you\u2019re a regular globe-trotter.\u201d He listened to what I had to say. At the name of Leroy-Beaulieu, he looked at me suspiciously. I conjectured that he had perhaps said something disparaging to M. Leroy-Beaulieu about my father and was afraid of the economist\u2019s having repeated it to him. All at once he seemed animated by a positive affection for my father. And after one of those opening hesitations out of which suddenly a word explodes as though in spite of the speaker, whose irresistible conviction prevails over his half-hearted efforts at silence: \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said to me with emotion, \u201cyour father must not stand. In his own interest he must not; it is not fair to himself; he owes a certain respect to his own really great merits, which would be compromised by such an adventure. He is too big a man for that. If he should be elected, he will have everything to lose and nothing to gain. He is not an orator, thank heaven. And that is the one thing that counts with my dear colleagues, even if you only talk platitudes. Your father has an important goal in life; he should march straight ahead towards it, and not allow himself to turn aside to beat bushes, even the bushes (more thorny for that matter than flowery) of the grove of Academe. Besides, he would not get many votes. The Academy likes to keep a postulant waiting for some time before taking him to its bosom. For the present, there is nothing to be done. Later on, I don\u2019t say. But he must wait until the Society itself comes in quest of him. It makes a practice; not a very fortunate practice, a fetish rather, of the far\u00e0 da s\u00e8 of our friends across the Alps. Leroy-Beaulieu spoke to me about all this in a way I did not at all like. I pointed out to him, a little sharply perhaps, that a man accustomed as he is to dealing with colonial imports and metals could not be expected to understand the part played by the imponderables, as Bismarck used to say. But, whatever happens, your father must on no account put himself forward as a candidate, Principis obsta. His friends would find themselves placed in a delicate position if he suddenly called upon them for their votes. Indeed,\u201d he broke forth, with an air of candour, fixing his blue eyes on my face, \u201cI am going to say a thing that you will be surprised to hear coming from me, who am so fond of your father. Well, simply because I am fond of him (we are known as the inseparables \u2014Arcades ambo), simply because I know the immense service that he can still render to his country, the reefs from which he can steer her if he remains at the helm; out of affection, out of high regard for him, out of patriotism, I should not vote for him. I fancy, moreover, that I have given him to understand that I should not.\u201d (I seemed to discern in his eyes the stern Assyrian profile of Leroy-Beaulieu.) \u201cSo that to give him my vote now would be a sort of recantation on my part.\u201d M. de Norpois repeatedly dismissed his brpther Academicians as old fossils. Other reasons apart, every member of a club or academy likes to ascribe to his fellow members the type of character that is the direct converse of his own, less for the advantage of being able to say: \u201cAh! If it only rested with me!\u201d than for the satisfaction of making the election which he himself has managed to secure seem more difficult, a greater distinction. \u201cI may tell you,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthat in the best interests of you all, I should prefer to see your father triumphantly elected in ten or fifteen years\u2019 time.\u201d Words which I assumed to have been dictated if not by jealousy, at any rate by an utter lack of any willingness to oblige, and which later on I was to recall when the course of events had given them a different meaning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou haven\u2019t thought of giving the Institute an address on the price of bread during the Fronde, I suppose,\u201d the historian of that movement timidly inquired of M. de Norpois. \u201cYou could make a considerable success of a subject like that,\u201d (which was to say, \u201cyou would give me a colossal advertisement,\u201d) he added, smiling at the Ambassador pusillanimously, but with a warmth of feeling which made him raise his eyelids and expose a double horizon of eye. I seemed to have seen this look before, and yet I had met the historian for the first time this afternoon. Suddenly I remembered having seen the same expression in the eyes of a Brazilian doctor who claimed to be able to cure choking fits of the kind from which I suffered by some absurd inhalation of the essential oils of plants. When, in the hope that he would pay more attention to my case, I had told him that I knew Professor Cottard, he had replied, as though speaking in Cotterd\u2019s interest: \u201cNow this treatment of mine, if you were to tell him about it, would give him the material for a most sensational paper for the Academy of Medicine!\u201d He had not ventured to press the matter but had stood gazing at me with the same air of interrogation, timid, anxious, appealing, which it had just puzzled me to see on the face of the historian of the Fronde. Obviously the two men were not acquainted and had little nothing in common, but psychological like physical laws have a more or less general application. And the requisite conditions are the same; an identical expression lights the eyes of different human animals, as a single sunrise lights different places, a long way apart, which have no connexion with one another. I did not hear the Ambassador\u2019s reply, for the whole party, with a good deal of noise, had again gathered round Mme. de Villeparisis to watch her at work\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know who\u2019 we\u2019re talking about, Basin?\u201d the Duchess asked her husband\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can make a pretty good guess,\u201d said the Duke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! As an actress she\u2019s not, I\u2019m afraid, in what one would call the great tradition.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes to M. d\u2019Argencourt \u201canything more ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn fact, it was drolatic,\u201d put in M. de Guermantes, whose odd vocabulary enabled people in society to declare that he was no fool and literary people, at the same time, to regard him as a complete imbecile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat I fail to understand,\u201d resumed the Duchess, \u201cis how in the world Robert ever came to fall in love with her. Oh, of course I know one mustn\u2019t discuss that sort of thing,\u201d she added, with the charming pout of a philosopher and sentimentalist whose last illusion had long been shattered. \u201cI know that anybody may fall in love with anybody else. And,\u201d she went on, for, though she might still laugh at modern literature, it, either by its dissemination through the popular press or else in the course of conversation, had begun to percolate into her mind, \u201cthat is the really nice thing about love, because it\u2019s what makes it so \u2018mysterious.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMysterious! Oh, I must confess, cousin, that\u2019s a bit beyond me,\u201d said the Comte d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh dear, yes, it\u2019s a very mysterious thing, love,\u201d declared the Duchess, with the sweet smile of a good-natured woman of the world, but also with the rooted conviction with which a Wagnerian assures a bored gentleman from the Club that there is something more than just noise in the Walk\u00fcre. \u201cAfter all, one never does know what makes one person fall in love with another; it may not be at all what we think,\u201d she added with a smile, repudiating at once by this interpretation the idea she had just suggested. \u201cAfter all, one never knows anything, does one?\u201d she concluded with an air of weary scepticism. \u201cBesides, one understands, doesn\u2019t one; one simply can\u2019t explain other people\u2019s choices in love.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But having laid down this principle she proceeded at once to abandon it and to criticise Saint-Loup\u2019s choice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAll the same, don\u2019t you know, it is amazing to me that a man can find any attraction in a person who\u2019s simply silly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch, hearing Saint-Loup\u2019s name mentioned and gathering that he was in Paris, promptly made a remark about him so outrageous that everybody was shocked. He was beginning to nourish hatreds, and one felt that he would stop at nothing to gratify them. Once he had established the principle that he himself was of great moral worth and that the sort of people who frequented La Boulie (an athletic club which he supposed to be highly fashionable) deserved penal servitude, every blow he could get against them seemed to him praiseworthy. He went so far once as to speak of a lawsuit which he was anxious to bring against one of his La poulie friends. In the course of the trial he proposed to give certain evidence which would be entirely untrue, though the defendant would be unable to impugn his veracity. In this way Bloch (who, incidentally, never put his plan into action) counted on baffling and infuriating his antagonist. What harm could there be in that, since he whom he sought to injure was a man who thought only of doing the \u2018right thing,\u2019 a La Boulie man, and against people like that any weapon was justified, especially in the hands of a Saint, such as Bloch himself?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, though, what about Swann?\u201d objected M. d\u2019Argencourt, who having at last succeeded in understanding the point of his cousin\u2019s speech, was impressed by her accuracy of observation, and was racking his brains for instances of men who had fallen in love with women in whom he himself had seen no attraction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but Swann\u2019s case was quite different,\u201d the Duchess protested. \u201cIt was a great surprise, I admit, because she\u2019s just a well-meaning idiot, but she was never silly, and she was at one time good looking.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, oh!\u201d muttered Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou never thought so? Surely, she had some charming points, very fine eyes, good hair, she used to dress, and does still dress, wonderfully. Nowadays, I quite agree, she\u2019s horrible, but she has been a lovely woman in her time. Not that that made me any less sorry when Charles married her, because it was so unnecessary.\u201d The Duchess had not intended to say anything out of the common, but as M. d\u2019Argencourt began to laugh she repeated these last words \u2014 either because she thought them amusing or because she thought it nice of him to laugh \u2014 and looked up at him with a coaxing smile, to add the enchantment of her femininity to that of her wit. She went on: \u201cYes, really, it wasn\u2019t worth the trouble, was it; still, after all, she did have some charm and I can quite understand anybody\u2019s falling in love with her, but if you saw Robert\u2019s girl, I assure you, you\u2019d simply die of laughter. Oh, I know somebody\u2019s going to quote Augier at me: \u2018What matters the bottle so long as one gets drunk?\u2019 Well, Robert may have got drunk, all right, but he certaintly hasn\u2019t shewn much taste in his choice of a bottle! First of all, would you believe that she actually expected me to fit up a staircase right in the middle of my drawing-room. Oh, a mere nothing \u2014 what? \u2014 and she announced that she was going to lie flat on her stomach on the steps. And then, if you\u2019d heard the things she recited, I only remember one scene, but I\u2019m sure nobody could imagine anything like it; it was called the Seven Princesses.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSeven Princesses! Dear, dear, what a snob she must be!\u201d cried M. d\u2019Argencourt. \u201cBut, wait a minute, why, I know the whole play. The author sent a copy to the King, who couldn\u2019t understand a word of it and called on me to explain it to him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt isn\u2019t by any chance, from the Sar Peladan?\u201d asked the historian of the Fronde, meaning to make a subtle and topical allusion, but in so low a tone that his question passed unnoticed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you know the Seven Princesses, do you?\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cI congratulate you! I only know one, but she\u2019s quite enough; I have no wish to make the acquaintance of the other six. If they are all like the one I\u2019ve seen!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a goose!\u201d I thought to myself. Irritated by the coldness of her greeting, I found a sort of bitter satisfaction in this proof of her complete inability to understand Maeterlinck. \u201cTo think that\u2019s the woman I walk miles every morning to see. Really, I\u2019m too kind. Well, it\u2019s my turn now not to want to see her.\u201d Thus I reasoned with myself; but my words ran counter to my thoughts; they were purely conversational words such as we say to ourselves at those moments when, too much excited to remain quietly alone, we feel the need, for want of another listener, to talk to ourselves, without meaning what we say, as we talk to a stranger\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what it was like,\u201d the Duchess went on; \u201cyou simply couldn\u2019t help laughing. Not that anyone tried; rather the other way, I\u2019m sorry to say, for the young person was not at all pleased and Robert has never really forgiven me. Though I can\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry, actually, because if it had been a success the lady would perhaps have come again, and I don\u2019t quite see Marie-Aynard approving of that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was the name given in the family to Robert\u2019s mother, Mme. de Marsantes, the widow of Aynard de Saint-Loup, to distinguish her from her cousin, the Princesse de Guermantes-Bavi\u00e8re, also a Marie, to whose Christian name her nephews and cousins and brothers-in-law added, to avoid confusion, either that of her husband or another of her own, making her Marie-Gilbert or Marie-Hedwige\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo begin with, there was a sort of rehearsal the night before, which was a wonderful affair!\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes in ironical pursuit of her theme. \u201cJust imagine, she uttered a sentence, no, not so much, not a quarter of a sentence, and then she stopped; she didn\u2019t open her mouth \u2014 I\u2019m not exaggerating \u2014 for a good five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, I say,\u201d cried M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith the utmost politeness I took the liberty of hinting to her that this might seem a little unusual. And she said \u2014 I give you her actual words \u2014\u2018One ought always to repeat a thing as though one were just composing it oneself.\u2019 When you think of it, that really is monumental.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I understood she wasn\u2019t at all bad at reciting poetry,\u201d said one of the two young men\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe hasn\u2019t the ghost of a notion what poetry is,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cHowever, I didn\u2019t need to listen to her to tell that. It was quite enough to see her come in with her lilies. I knew at once that she couldn\u2019t have any talent when I saw those lilies!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everybody laughed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope, my dear aunt, you aren\u2019t angry with me, over my little joke the other day about the Queen of Sweden. I\u2019ve come to ask your forgiveness.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m not at all angry, I even give you leave to eat at my table, if you\u2019re hungry. \u2014 Come along, M. Valm\u00e8re, you\u2019re the daughter of the house,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis went on to the librarian, repeating a time-honoured pleasantry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M de Guermantes sat upright in the armchair in which he had come to anchor his hat on the carpet by his side, and examined with a satisfied smile the plate of little cakes that was being held out to him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis gentleman makes you an admirable daughter,\u201d commented M. d\u2019Argencourt, whom the spirit of imitation prompted to keep Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s little joke in circulation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The librarian handed the plate of cakes to the historian of the Fronde\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou perform your functions admirably,\u201d said the latter, startled into speech, and hoping also to win the sympathy of the crowd. At the same time he cast a covert glance of connivance at those who had anticipated him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me, my dear aunt,\u201d M. de Guermantes inquired of Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cwho was that rather good-looking man who was going out just now as I came in? I must know him, because he gave me a sweeping bow, but I couldn\u2019t place him at all; you know I never can remember names, it\u2019s such a nuisance,\u201d he added, in a tone of satisfaction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cM. Legrandin.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but Oriane has a cousin whose mother, if I\u2019m not mistaken, was a Grandin. Yes, I remember quite well, she was a Grandin de l\u2019Epervier.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cno relation at all. These are plain Grandins. Grandins of nothing at all. But they\u2019d be only too glad to be Grandins of anything you chose to name. This one has a sister called Mme. de Cambremer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, Basin, you know quite well who\u2019 my aunt means,\u201d cried the Duchess indignantly. \u201cHe\u2019s the brother of that great graminivorous creature you had the weird idea of sending to call on me the other day. She stayed a solid hour; I thought I should go mad. But I began by thinking it was she who was mad when I saw a person I didn\u2019t know come browsing into the room looking exactly like a cow.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, Oriane; she asked me what afternoon you were at home; I couldn\u2019t very well be rude to her; and besides, you do exaggerate so, she\u2019s not in the least like a cow,\u201d he added in a plaintive tone, though not without a quick smiling glance at the audience\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He knew that his wife\u2019s lively wit needed the stimulus of contradiction, the contradiction of common sense which protests that one cannot (for instance) mistake a woman seriously for a cow; by this process Mme. de Guermantes, enlarging upon her original idea, had been inspired to produce many of her most brilliant sayings. And the Duke in his innocent fashion helped her, without seeming to do so, to bring off her effects like, in a railway carriage, the unacknowledged partner of the three-card player\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI admit she doesn\u2019t look like a cow, she looks like a dozen,\u201d exclaimed Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cI assure you, I didn\u2019t know what to do when I saw a herd of cattle come marching into my drawing-room in a hat and heard them ask me how I was. I had half a mind to say: \u2018Please, herd of cattle, you must be making a mistake, you can\u2019t possibly know me, because you\u2019re a herd of cattle,\u2019 but after racking my brains over her I came to the conclusion that your Cambremer woman must be the Infanta Dorothea who had said she was coming to see me one day, and is rather bovine also, so that I was just on the point of saying: \u2018Your Royal Highness\u2019 and using the third person to a herd of cattle. The cut of her dewlap reminded me rather, too, of the Queen of Sweden. But this massed attack had been prepared for by long range artillery fire, according to all the rules of war. For I don\u2019t know how long before, I was bombarded with her cards; I used to find them lying about all over the house, on all the tables and chairs like prospectuses. I couldn\u2019t think what they were supposed to be advertising. You saw nothing in the house but \u2018Marquis et Marquise de Cambremer\u2019 with some address or other which I\u2019ve forgotten; you may be quite sure nothing will ever take me there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut it\u2019s a great distinction to look like a Queen,\u201d said the historian of the Fronde\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGad, sir, Kings and Queens, in these days, don\u2019t amount to much,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, partly because he liked to be thought broad-minded and modern, and also so as not to seem to attach any importance to his own royal friendships, which he valued highly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch and M. de Norpois had returned from the other room and came towards us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, sir,\u201d asked Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201chave you been talking to him about the Dreyfus case?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois raised his eyes to the ceiling, but with a smile, as though calling on heaven to witness the monstrosity of the caprices to which his Dulcinea compelled him to submit. Nevertheless he spoke to Bloch with great affability of the terrible, perhaps fatal period through which France was passing. As this presumably meant that M. de Norpois (to whom Bloch had confessed his belief in the innocence of Dreyfus) was an ardent anti-Dreyfusard, the Ambassador\u2019s geniality, his air of tacit admission that his listener was in the right, of never doubting that they were both of the same opinion, of being prepared to join forces with him to overthrow the Government, flattered Bloch\u2019s vanity and aroused his curiosity. What were the important points which M. de Norpois never specified but on which he seemed implicitly to affirm that he was in agreement with Bloch; what opinion, then, did he hold of the case, that could bring them together? Bloch was all the more astonished at the mysterious unanimity which seemed to exist between him and M. de Norpois, in that it was not confined to politics, Mme. de Villeparisis having spoken at some length to M. de Norpois of Bloch\u2019s literary work\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are not of your age,\u201d the former Ambassador told him, \u201cand I congratulate you upon that. You are not of this age in which disinterested work no longer exists, in which writers offer the public nothing but obscenities or ineptitudes. Efforts such as yours ought to be encouraged, and would be, if we had a Government.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch was flattered by this picture of himself swimming alone amid a universal shipwreck. But here again he would have been glad of details, would have liked to know what were the ineptitudes to which M. de Norpois referred. Bloch had the feeling that he was working along the same lines as plenty of others; he had never supposed himself to be so exceptional. He returned to the Dreyfus case, but did not succeed in elucidating M. de Norpois\u2019s own views. He tried to induce him to speak of the officers whose names were appearing constantly in the newspapers at that time; they aroused more curiosity than the politicians who were involved also, because they were not, like the politicians, well known already, but, wearing a special garb, emerging from the obscurity of a different kind of life and a religiously guarded silence, simply stood up and spoke and disappeared again, like Lohengrin landing from a skiff drawn by a swan. Bloch had been able, thanks to a Nationalist lawyer of his acquaintance, to secure admission to several hearings of the Zola trial. He would arrive there in the morning and stay until the court rose, with a packet of sandwiches and a flask of coffee, as though for the final examination for a degree, and this change of routine stimulating a nervous excitement which the coffee and the emotional interest of the trial worked up to a climax, he would come out so enamoured of everything that had happened in court that, in the evening, as he sat at home, he would long to immerse himself again in that beautiful dream and would hurry out, to a restaurant frequented by both parties, in search of friends with whom he would go over interminably the whole of the day\u2019s proceedings, and make up, by a supper ordered in an imperious tone which gave him the illusion of power, for the hunger and exhaustion of a day begun so early and unbroken by any interval for luncheon. The human mind, hovering perpetually between the two planes of experience and imagination, seeks to fathom the ideal life of the people it knows and to know the people whose life it has had to imagine. To Bloch\u2019s questions M. de Norpois replied:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere are two officers involved in the case now being tried of whom I remember hearing some time ago from a man in whose judgment I felt great confidence, and who praised them both highly \u2014 I mean M. de Miribel. They are Lieutenant-Colonel Henry and Lieutenant-Colonel Picquart.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut,\u201d exclaimed Bloch, \u201cthe divine Athena, daughter of Zeus, has put in the mind of one the opposite of what is in the mind of the other. And they are fighting against one another like two lions. Colonel Picquart had a splendid position in the Army, but his Moira has led him to the side that was not rightly his. The sword of the Nationalists will carve his tender flesh, and he will be cast out as food for the beasts of prey and the birds that wax fat upon the bodies of men.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois made no reply\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat are those two palavering about over there?\u201d M. de Guermantes asked Mme. de Villeparisis, indicating M. de Norpois and Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Dreyfus case.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe devil they are. By the way, do you know who is a red-hot supporter of Dreyfus? I give you a thousand guesses. My nephew Robert! I can tell you that, at the Jockey, when they heard of his goings on, there was a fine gathering of the clans, a regular hue and cry. And as he\u2019s coming up for election next week . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course,\u201d broke in the Duchess, \u201cif they\u2019re all like Gilbert, who keeps on saying that all the Jews ought to be sent back to Jerusalem.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed; then the Prince de Guermantes is quite of my way of thinking,\u201d put in M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duke made a show of his wife, but did not love her. Extremely self-centred, he hated to be interrupted, besides he was in the habit, at home of treating her brutally. Convulsed with the twofold rage of a bad husband when his wife speaks to him, and a good talker wher he is not listened to, he stopped short and transfixed the Duchess with a glare which made everyone feel uncomfortable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat makes you think we want to hear about Gilbert and Jerusalem? It\u2019s nothing to do with that. But,\u201d he went on in a gentler tone, \u201cyou will agree that if one of our family were to be pilled at the Jockey, especially Robert, whose father was chairman for ten years, it would be a pretty serious matter. What can you expect, my dear, it\u2019s got \u2019em on the raw, those fellows; they\u2019re all over it. I don\u2019t blame them, either; personally, you know that I have no racial prejudice, all that sort of thing seems to me out of date, and I do claim to move with the times; but damn it all, when one goes by the name of \u2018Marquis de Saint-Loup\u2019 one isn\u2019t a Dreyfusard; what more can I say?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes uttered the words: \u201cWhen one goes by the name of Marquis de Saint-Loup,\u201d with some emphasis. He knew very well that it was a far greater thing to go by that of Duc de Guermantes. But if his self-esteem had a tendency to exaggerate if anything the superiority of the title Duc de Guermantes over all others, it was perhaps not so much the rules of good taste as the laws of imagination that urged him thus to attenuate it. Each of us sees in the brightest colours what he sees at a distance, what he sees in other people. For the general laws which govern perspective in imagination apply just as much to dukes as to ordinary mortals. And not only the laws of imagination, but those of speech. Now, either of two laws of speech may apply here, one being that which makes us express ourselves like others of our mental category and not of our caste. Under this law M. de Guermantes might be, in his choice of expressions, even when he wished to talk about the nobility, indebted to the humblest little tradesman, who would have said: \u201cWhen one goes by the name of Duc de Guermantes,\u201d whereas an educated man, a Swann, a Legrandin would not have said it. A duke may write novels worthy of a grocer, even about life in high society, titles and pedigrees being of no help to him there, and the epithet \u2018aristocratic\u2019 be earned by the writings of a plebeian. Who had been, in this instance, the inferior from whom M. de Guermantes had picked up \u2018when one goes by the name,\u2019 he had probably not the least idea. But another law of speech is that, from time to time, as there appear and then vanish diseases of which nothing more is ever heard, there come into being, no one knows how, spontaneously perhaps or by an accident like that which introduced into France a certain weed from America, the seeds of which, caught in the wool of a travelling rug, fell on a railway embankment, forms of speech which one hears in the same decade on the lips of people who have not in any way combined together to use them. So, just as in a certain year I heard Bloch say, referring to himself, that \u201cthe most charming people, the most brilliant, the best known, the most exclusive had discovered that there was only one man in Paris whom they felt to be intelligent, pleasant, whom they could not do without \u2014 namely Bloch,\u201d and heard the same phrase used by countless other young men who did not know him and varied it only by substituting their own names for his, so I was often to hear this \u2018when one goes by the name.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat can one expect,\u201d the Duke went on, \u201cwith the influence he\u2019s come under; it\u2019s easy to understand.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStill it is rather comic,\u201d suggested the Duchess, \u201cwhen you think of his mother\u2019s attitude, how she bores us to tears with her Patrie Fran\u00e7aise, morning, noon and night.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, but there\u2019s not only his mother to be thought of, you can\u2019t humbug us like that. There\u2019s a damsel, too, a fly-by-night of the worst type; she has far more influence over him than his mother, and she happens to be a compatriot of Master Dreyfus. She has passed on her state of mind to Robert.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou may not have heard, Duke, that there is a new word to describe that sort of mind,\u201d said the librarian, who was Secretary to the Anti-revisionist Committee. \u201cThey say \u2018mentality.\u2019 It means exactly the same thing, but it has this advantage that nobody knows what you\u2019re talking about. It is the very latest expression just now, the \u2018last word\u2019 as people say.\u201d Meanwhile, having heard Bloch\u2019s name, he was watching him question M. de Norpois with misgivings which aroused others as strong though of a different order in the Marquise. Trembling before the librarian, and always acting the anti-Dreyfusard in his presence, she dreaded what he would say were he to find out that she had asked to her house a Jew more or less affiliated to the \u2018Syndicate.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed,\u201d said the Duke, \u201c\u2018mentality,\u2019 you say; I must make a note of that; I shall use it some day.\u201d This was no figure of speech, the Duke having a little pocketbook filled with such \u2018references\u2019 which he used to consult before dinner-parties. \u201cI like \u2018mentality.\u2019 There are a lot of new words like that which people suddenly start using, but they never last. I read somewhere the other day that some writer was \u2018talentuous.\u2019 You may perhaps know what it means; I don\u2019t. And since then I\u2019ve never come across the word again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut \u2018mentality\u2019 is more widely used than \u2018talentuous,\u2019\u201d the historian of the Fronde made his way into the conversation. \u201cI am on a Committee at the Ministry of Education at which I have heard it used several times, as well as at my Club, the Volney, and indeed at dinner at M. Emile Ollivier\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI, who have not the honour to belong to the Ministry of Education,\u201d replied the Duke with a feigned humility but with a vanity so intense that his lips could not refrain from curving in a smile, nor his eyes from casting round his audience a glance sparkling with joy, the ironical scorn in which made the poor historian blush, \u201cI who have not the honour to belong to the Ministry of Education,\u201d he repeated, relishing the sound of his words, \u201cnor to the Volney Club (my only clubs are the Union and the Jockey \u2014 you aren\u2019t in the Jockey, I think, sir?\u201d he asked the historian, who, blushing a still deeper red, scenting an insult and failing to understand it, began to tremble in every limb), \u201cI, who am not even invited to dine with M. Emile Ollivier, I must confess that I had never heard \u2018mentality.\u2019 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re in the same boat, Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know,\u201d he went on, \u201cwhy they can\u2019t produce the proofs of Dreyfus\u2019s guilt. Apparently it\u2019s because the War Minister\u2019s wife was his mistress, that\u2019s what people are saying.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! I thought it was the Prime Minister\u2019s wife,\u201d said M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI think you\u2019re all equally tiresome about this wretched case,\u201d said the Duchesse de Guermantes, who, in the social sphere, was always anxious to shew that she did not allow herself to be led by anyone. \u201cIt can\u2019t make any difference to me, so far as the Jews are concerned, for the simple reason that I don\u2019t know any of them, and I intend to remain in that state of blissful ignorance. But on the other hand I do think it perfectly intolerable that just because they\u2019re supposed to hold \u2018sound\u2019 views and don\u2019t deal with Jewish tradesmen, or have \u2018Down with the Jews\u2019 printed on their sunshades, we should have a swarm of Durands and Dubois and so forth, women we should never have known but for this business, forced down our throats by Marie-Aynard or Victurnienne. I went to see Marie-Aynard a couple of days ago. It used to be so nice there. Nowadays one finds all the people one has spent one\u2019s life trying to avoid, on the pretext that they\u2019re against Dreyfus, and others of whom you have no idea who they can be.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; it was the War Minister\u2019s wife; at least, that\u2019s the bedside rumour,\u201d went on the Duke, who liked to flavour his conversation with certain expressions which he imagined to be of the old school. \u201cPersonally, of course, as everyone knows, I take just the opposite view to my cousin Gilbert. I am not feudal like him. I would go about with a Negro if he was a friend of mine, and I shouldn\u2019t care two straws what anybody thought; still after all you will agree with me that when one goes by the name of Saint-Loup one doesn\u2019t amuse oneself by running clean against the rails of public opinion, which has more sense than Voltaire or even my nephew. Nor does one go in for what I may be allowed to call these acrobatics of conscience a week before one comes up for a club. It is a bit stiff, really! No, it is probably that little wench of his that has put him on his high horse. I expect she told him that he would be classed among the \u2018intellectuals.\u2019 The intellectuals, they\u2019re the very cream of those gentry. It\u2019s given rise, by the way, to a rather amusing pun, though a very naughty one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the Duke murmured, lowering his voice, for his wife\u2019s and M. d\u2019Argencourt\u2019s benefit, \u201cMater Semita,\u201d which had already made its way into the Jockey Club, for, of all the flying seeds in the world, that to which are attached the most solid wings, enabling it to be disseminated at the greatest distance from its parent branch, is still a joke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe might ask this gentleman, who has a nerudite air, to explain it to us,\u201d he went on, indicating the historian. \u201cBut it is better not to repeat it, especially as there\u2019s not a vestige of truth in the suggestion. I am not so ambitious as my cousin Mirepoix, who claims that she can trace the descent of her family before Christ to the Tribe of Levi, and I will undertake to prove that there has never been a drop of Jewish blood in our family. Still there is no good in our shutting our eyes to the fact, you may be sure that my dear nephew\u2019s highly original views are liable to make a considerable stir at Landerneau. Especially as Fezensac is ill just now, and Duras will be running the election; you know how he likes to make nuisances,\u201d concluded the Duke, who had never succeeded in learning the exact meaning of certain phrases, and supposed \u2018making nuisances\u2019 to mean \u2018making difficulties.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch tried to pin M. de Norpois down on Colonel Picquart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere can be no two opinions;\u201d replied M. de Norpois, \u201chis evidence had to be taken. I am well aware that, by maintaining this attitude, I have drawn screams of protest from more than one of my colleagues, but to my mind the Government were bound to let the Colonel speak. One can\u2019t dance lightly out of a blind alley like that, or if one does there\u2019s always the risk of falling into a ditch. As for the officer himself, his statement gave one, at the first hearing, a most excellent impression. When one saw him, looking so well in that smart Chasseur uniform, come into court and relate in a perfectly simple and frank tone what he had seen and what he had deduced, and say: \u2018On my honour as a soldier\u2019\u201d (here M. de Norpois\u2019s voice shook with a faint patriotic throb) \u201c\u2018such is my conviction,\u2019 it is impossible to deny that the impression he made was profound.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere; he is a Dreyfusard, there\u2019s not the least doubt of it,\u201d thought Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut where he entirely forfeited all the sympathy that he had managed to attract was when he was confronted with the registrar, Gribelin. When one heard that old public servant, a man who had only one answer to make,\u201d (here M. de Norpois began to accentuate his words with the energy of his sincere convictions) \u201cwhen one listened to him, when one saw him look his superior officer in the face, not afraid to hold his head up to him, and say to him in a tone that admitted of no response: \u2018Colonel, sir, you know very well that I have never told a lie, you know that at this moment, as always, I am speaking the truth,\u2019 the wind changed; M. Picquart might move heaven and earth at the subsequent hearings; he made a complete fiasco.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; evidently he\u2019s an anti-Dreyfusard; it\u2019s quite obvious,\u201d said Bloch to himself. \u201cBut if he considers Picquart a traitor and a liar, how can he take his revelations seriously, and quote them as if he found them charming and believed them to be sincere. And if, on the other hand, he sees in him an honest man easing his conscience, how can he suppose him to have been lying when he was confronted with Gribelin?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn any case, if this man Dreyfus is innocent,\u201d the Duchess broke in, \u201che hasn\u2019t done much to prove it. What idiotic, raving letters he writes from that island. I don\u2019t know whether M. Esterhazy is any better, but he does shew some skill in his choice of words, a different tone altogether. That can\u2019t be very pleasant for the supporters of M. Dreyfus. What a pity for them there\u2019s no way of exchanging innocents.\u201d Everybody laughed. \u201cYou heard what Oriane said?\u201d the Duc de Guermantes inquired eagerly of e. de Villeparisis. \u201cYes; I think it most amusing.\u201d This was not enough for the Duke. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t say that I thought it amusing; or rather it doesn\u2019t make the slightest difference to me whether a thing is amusing or not. I don\u2019t care about wit.\u201d M. d\u2019Argencourt protested. \u201cIt is probably because I\u2019ve been a Member of Parliament, where I have listened to brilliant speeches that meant absolutely nothing. I learned there to value, more than anything, logic. That\u2019s probably why they didn\u2019t elect me again. Amusing things leave me cold.\u201d \u201cBasin, don\u2019t play the heavy father like that, my child, you know quite well that no one admires wit more than you do.\u201d \u201cPlease let me finish. It is just because I am unmoved by a certain type of humour, that I am often struck by my wife\u2019s wit. For you will find it based, as a rule, upon sound observation. She reasons like a man; she states her case like a writer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Possibly the explanation of M. de Norpois\u2019s speaking in this way to Bloch, as though they had been in agreement, may have lain in the fact that he himself was so keen an anti-Dreyfusard that, finding the Government not anti-Dreyfusard enough, he was its enemy just as much as the Dreyfusards. Perhaps because the object to which he devoted himself in politics was something more profound, situated on another plane, from which Dreyfusism appeared as an unimportant modality which did not deserve the attention of a patriot interested in large questions of foreign policy. Perhaps, rather, because the maxims of his political wisdom being applicable only to questions of form, of procedure, of expediency, they were as powerless to solve questions of fact as in philosophy pure logic is powerless to tackle the problems of existence; or else because that very wisdom made him see danger in handling such subjects and so, in his caution, he preferred to speak only of minor incidents. But where Bloch made a mistake was in thinking that M. de Norpois, even had he been less cautious by nature and of a less exclusively formal cast of mind, could (supposing he would) have told him the truth as to the part played by Henry, Picquart or du Paty de Clam, or as to any of the different aspects of the case. The truth, indeed, as to all these matters Bloch could not doubt that M. de Norpois knew. How could he fail to know it seeing that he was a friend of all the Ministers? Naturally, Bloch thought that the truth in politics could be approximately reconstructed by the most luminous minds, but he imagined, like the man in the street, that it resided permanently, beyond the reach of argument and in a material form, in the secret files of the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister, who imparted it to their Cabinet. Now, even when a political truth does take the form of written documents, it is seldom that these have any more value than a radiographic plate on which the layman imagines that the patient\u2019s disease is inscribed in so many words, when, as a matter of fact, the plate furnishes simply one piece of material for study, to be combined with a number of others, which the doctor\u2019s reasoning powers will take into consideration as a whole and upon them found his diagnosis. So, too, the truth in politics, when one goes to well-informed men and imagines that one is about to grasp it, eludes one. Indeed, later on (to confine ourselves to the Dreyfus case), when so startling an event occurred as Henry\u2019s confession, followed by his suicide, this fact was at once interpreted in opposite ways by the Dreyfusard Ministers, and by Cavaignac and Cuignet who had themselves made the discovery of the forgery and conducted the examination; still more so among the Dreyfusard Ministers themselves, men of the same shade of Dreyfusism, judging not only from the same documents but in the same spirit, the part played by Henry was explained in two entirely different ways, one set seeing in him an accomplice of Esterhazy, the others assigning that part to du Paty de Clam, thus rallying in support of a theory of their opponent Cuignet and in complete opposition to their supporter Reinach. All that Bloch could elicit from M. de Norpois was that if it were true that the Chief of Staff, M. de Boisdeffre, had had a secret communication sent to M. Rochefort, it was evident that a singularly regrettable irregularity had occurred\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou may be quite sure that the War Minister must (in petto at any rate) be consigning his Chief of Staff to the infernal powers. An official disclaimer would not have been (to my mind) a work of supererogation. But the War Minister expresses himself very bluntly on the matter inter pocula. There are certain subjects, moreover, about which it is highly imprudent to create an agitation over which one cannot retain control afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut those documents are obviously forged,\u201d put in Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois made no reply to this, but announced that he did not approve of the manifestations that were being made by Prince Henri d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBesides, they can only ruffle the calm of the pretorium, and encourage agitations which, looked at from either point of view, would be deplorable. Certainly we must put a stop to the anti-militarist conspiracy, but we cannot possibly tolerate, either, a brawl encouraged by those elements on the Right who instead of serving the patriotic ideal themselves are hoping to make it serve them. Heaven be praised, France is not a South American Republic, and the need has not yet been felt here for a military pronunciamento.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bioch could not get him to speak on the question of Dreyfus\u2019s guilt, nor would he utter any forecast as to the judgment in the civil trial then proceeding. On the other hand, M. de Norpois seemed only too ready to indicate the consequences of this judgment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf it is a conviction,\u201d he said, \u201cit will probably be quashed, for it is seldom that, in a case where there has been such a number of witnesses, there is not some flaw in the procedure which counsel can raise on appeal. To return to Prince Henri\u2019s outburst, I greatly doubt whether it has met with his father\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou think Chartres is for Dreyfus?\u201d asked the Duchess with a smile, her eyes rounded, her cheeks bright, her nose buried in her plate, her whole manner deliciously scandalised\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all; I meant only that there runs through the whole family, on that side, a political sense which we have seen, in the admirable Princesse Cl\u00e9mentine, carried to its highest power, and which her son, Prince Ferdinand, has kept as a priceless inheritance. You would never have found the Prince of Bulgaria clasping Major Esterhazy to his bosom.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe would have preferred a private soldier,\u201d murmured Mme. de Guermantes, who often met the Bulgarian monarch at dinner at the Prince de Joinville\u2019s, and had said to him once, when he asked if she was not envious: \u201cYes, Sir, of your bracelets.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to Mme. de Sagan\u2019s ball this evening?\u201d M. de Norpois asked Mme. de Villeparisis, to cut short his conversation with Bloch. My friend had not failed to interest the Ambassador, who told us afterwards, not without a quaint simplicity, thinking no doubt of the traces that survived in Bloch\u2019s speech of the neo-Homeric manner which he had on the whole outgrown: \u201cHe is rather amusing, with that way of speaking, a trifle old fashioned, a trifle solemn. You expect him to come out with \u2018The Learned Sisters,\u2019 like Lamartine or Jean-Baptiste Rousseau. It has become quite uncommon in the youth of the present day, as it was indeed in the generation before them. We ourselves were inclined to be romantic.\u201d But however exceptional his companion may have seemed to him, M. de Norpois decided that the conversation had lasted long enough\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, sir, I don\u2019t go to balls any more,\u201d she replied with a charming grandmotherly smile. \u201cYou\u2019re going, all of you, I suppose? You\u2019re the right age for that sort of thing,\u201d she added, embracing in a comprehensive glance M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault, his friend and Bloch. \u201cStill, I was asked,\u201d she went on, pretending, just for fun, to be flattered by the distinction. \u201cIn fact, they came specially to ask me.\u201d (\u2018They\u2019 being the Princesse de Sagan.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI haven\u2019t had a card,\u201d said Bloch, thinking that Mme. de Villeparisis would at once offer to procure him one, and that Mme. de Sagan would be glad to see at her ball the friend of a woman whom she had called in person to invite\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Marquise made no reply, and Bloch did not press the point, for he had another, more serious matter to discuss with her, and, with that in view, had already asked her whether he might call again in a couple of days. Having heard the two young men say that they had both just resigned from the Rue Royale Club, which was letting in every Tom, Dick and Harry, he wished to ask Mme. de Villeparisis to arrange for his election there\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAren\u2019t they rather bad form, rather stuck-up snobs, these Sagans?\u201d he inquired in a tone of sarcasm\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all, they\u2019re the best we can do for you in that line,\u201d M. d\u2019Argencourt, who adopted all the catch-words of Parisian society, assured him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen,\u201d said Bloch, still half in irony, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s one of the solemnities, the great social fixtures of the season.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis turned merrily to Mme. de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell us, is it a great social solemnity, Mme. de Sagan\u2019s ball?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s no good asking me,\u201d answered the Duchess, \u201cI have never yet succeeded in finding out what a social solemnity is. Besides, society isn\u2019t my strong point.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed; I thought it was just the other way,\u201d said Bloch, who supposed Mme. de Guermantes to be speaking seriously\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He continued, to the desperation of M. de Norpois, to ply him with questions about the Dreyfus case. The Ambassador declared that, looking at it from outside, he got the impression from du Paty de Clam of a somewhat cloudy brain, which had perhaps not been very happily chosen to conduct that delicate operation, which required so much coolness and discernment, a judicial inquiry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know that the Socialist Party are crying aloud for his head on a charger, as well as for the immediate release of the prisoner from the Devil\u2019s Isle. But I think that we are not yet reduced to the necessity of passing the Caudine Forks of MM. G\u00e9rault-Richard and Company. So far, the whole case has been an utter mystery, I don\u2019t say that on one side just as much as on the other there has not been some pretty dirty work to be hushed up. That certain of your client\u2019s more or less disinterested protectors may have the best intentions I will not attempt to deny, but you know that heaven is paved with such things,\u201d he added, with a look of great subtlety. \u201cIt is essential that the Government should give the impression that they are not in the hands of the factions of the Left, and that they are not going to surrender themselves, bound hand and foot, at the demand of some pretorian guard or other, which, believe me, is not the same thing as the Army. It stands to reason that, should any fresh evidence come to light, a new trial would be ordered. And what follows from that? Obviously, that to demand a new trial is to force an open door. When the day comes, the Government will speak with no uncertain voice or will let fall into abeyance what is their essential prerogative. Cock and bull stories will no longer be enough. We must appoint judges to try Dreyfus. And that will be an easy matter because, although we have acquired the habit, in our sweet France, where we love to belittle ourselves, of thinking or letting it be thought that, in order to hear the words Truth and Justice, it is necessary to cross the Channel, which is very often only a roundabout way of reaching the Spree, there are judges to be found outside Berlin. But once the machinery of Government has been set in motion, will you have ears for the voice of authority? When it bids you perform your duty as a citizen will you have ears for its voice, will you take your stand in the ranks of law and order? When its patriotic appeal sounds, will you have the wisdom not to turn a deaf ear but to answer: \u2018Present!\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois put these questions to Bloch with a vehemence which, while it alarmed my friend, flattered him also; for the Ambassador spoke to him with the air of one addressing a whole party, questioned him as though he had been in the confidence of that party and might be held responsible for the decisions which it would adopt. \u201cShould you fail to disarm,\u201d M. de Norpois went on, without waiting for Bloch\u2019s collective answer, \u201cshould you, before even the ink had dried on the decree ordering the fresh trial of the case, obeying it matters not what insidious word of command, fail, I say, to disarm, and band yourselves, rather, in a sterile opposition which seems to some minds the ultima ratio of policy, should you retire to your tents and burn your boats, you would be doing so to your own, damnation. Are you the prisoners of those who foment disorder? Have you given them pledges?\u201d Bloch was in doubt how to answer. M. de Norpois gave him no time. \u201cIf the negative be true, as I should like to think, and if you have a little of what seems to me to be lamentably lacking in certain of your leaders and your friends, namely political sense, then, on the day when the Criminal Court assembles, if you do not allow yourselves to be dragooned by the fishers in troubled waters, you will have won your battle. I do not guarantee that the whole of the General Staff is going to get away unscathed, but it will be so much to the good if some of them at least can save their faces without setting the heather on fire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt stands to reason, moreover, that it is with the Government that it rests to pronounce judgment, and to close the list \u2014 already too long \u2014 of unpunished crimes, not certainly at the bidding of Socialist agitators, nor yet of any obscure military mouthpiece,\u201d he added, looking Bloch boldly in the face, perhaps with the instinct that leads all Conservatives to establish support for themselves in the enemy\u2019s camp. \u201cGovernment action is not to be dictated by the highest bidder, from wherever the bid may come. The Government are not, thank heaven, under the orders of Colonel Driant, nor, at the other end of the scale, under M. Clemenceau\u2019s. We must curb the professional agitators and prevent them from raising their heads again. France, the vast majority here in France, desires only to be allowed to work in orderly conditions. As to that, there can be no question whatever. But we must not be afraid to enlighten public opinion; and if a few sheep, of the kind our friend Rabelais knew so well, should dash headlong into the water, it would be as well to point out to them that the water in question was troubled, that it had been troubled deliberately by an agency not within our borders, in order to conceal the dangers lurking in its depths. And the Government ought not to give the impression that they are emerging from their passivity in self-defence when they exercise the right which is essentially their own, I mean that of setting the wheels of justice in motion. The Government will accept all your suggestions. If it is proved that there has been a judicial error, they can be sure of an overwhelming majority which would give them room to act with freedom.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou, sir,\u201d said Bloch, turning to M. d\u2019Argencourt, to whom he had been made known, with the rest of the party, on that gentleman\u2019s arrival, \u201cyou are a Dreyfusard, of course; they all are, abroad.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is a question that concerns only the French themselves, don\u2019t you think?\u201d replied M. d\u2019Argencourt with that peculiar form of insolence which consists in ascribing to the other person an opinion which one must, obviously, know that he does not hold since he has just expressed one directly its opposite\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch coloured; M. d\u2019Argencourt smiled, looking round the room, and if this smile, so long as it was directed at the rest of the company, was charged with malice at Bloch\u2019s expense, it became tempered with cordiality when finally it came to rest on the face of my friend, so as to deprive him of any excuse for annoyance at the words which he had heard uttered, though those words remained just as cruel. Mme. de Guermantes murmured something to M. d\u2019Argencourt which I could not hear, but which must have referred to Bloch\u2019s religion, for there flitted at that moment over the face of the Duchess that expression to which one\u2019s fear of being noticed by the person of whom one is speaking gives a certain hesitancy and unreality, while there is blended with it the inquisitive, malicious amusement inspired in one by a group of human beings to which one feels oneself to be fundamentally alien. To retrieve himself, Bloch turned to the Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault. \u201cYou, sir, as a Frenchman, you must be aware that people abroad are all Dreyfusards, although everyone pretends that in prance we never know what is going on abroad. Anyhow, I know \u00cf can talk freely to you; Saint-Loup told me so.\u201d But the young Duke, who felt that every one was turning against Bloch, and was a coward as people often are in society, employing a mordant and precious form of wit which he seemed, by a sort of collateral atavism, to have inherited from M. de Charlus, replied: \u201cYou must not ask me, sir, to discuss the Dreyfus case with you; it is a subject which, on principle, I never mention except to Japhetics.\u201d Everyone smiled, except Bloch, not that he was not himself in the habit of making scathing references to his Jewish origin, to that side of his ancestry which came from somewhere near Sinai. But instead of one of these epigrams (doubtless because he had not one ready) the operation of the internal machine brought to Bloch\u2019s lips something quite different. And we caught only: \u201cBut how on earth did you know? Who told you?\u201d as though he had been the son of a convict. Whereas, given his name, which had not exactly a Christian sound, and his face, his surprise argued a certain simplicity of mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What M. de Norpois had said not having completely satisfied him, he went up to the librarian and asked him whether Mme. de Villeparisis did not sometimes have in her house M. du Paty de Clam or M. Joseph Reinach. The librarian made no reply; he was a Nationalist, and never ceased preaching to the Marquise that the social revolution might break out at any moment, and that she ought to shew more caution in the choice of her friends. He asked himself whether Bloch might not be a secret emissary of the Syndicate, come to collect information, and went off at once to repeat to Mme. de Villeparisis the questions that Bloch had put to him. She decided that, at the best, he was ill-bred and might be in a position to compromise M. de Norpois. Also, she wished to give satisfaction to the librarian, the only person of whom she went in fear, by whom she was being indoctrinated, though without any marked success (every morning he read her M. Judet\u2019s article in the Petit Journal). She decided, therefore, to make it plain to Bloch that he need not come to the house again, and had no difficulty in finding, among her social repertory, the scene by which a great lady shows anyone her door, a scene which does not in any way involve the raised finger and blazing eyes that people imagine. As Bloch came up to her to say good-bye, buried in her deep armchair, she seemed only half-awakened from a vague somnolence. Her sunken eyes gleamed with only the feeble though charming light of a pair of pearls. Bloch\u2019s farewell, barely pencilling on the Marquise\u2019s face a languid smile, drew from her not a word, nor did she offer him her hand. This scene left Bloch in utter bewilderment, but as he was surrounded by a circle of spectators he felt that it could not be prolonged without disadvantage to himself, and, to force the Marquise, the hand which she had made no effort to take he himself thrust out at her. Mme. de Villeparisis was startled. But doubtless, while still bent upon giving an immediate satisfaction to the librarian and the anti-Dreyfusard clan, she wished at the same time to provide for the future, and so contented herself with letting her eyelids droop over her closing eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI believe she\u2019s asleep,\u201d said Bloch to the librarian who, feeling that he had the support of the Marquise, assumed an indignant air. \u201cGood-bye madame,\u201d snouted Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The old lady made the slight movement with her lips of a dying woman who wants to open her mouth but whose eye can no longer recognise people. Then she turned, overflowing with a restored vitality, to M. d\u2019Argencourt, while Bloch left the room, convinced that she must be \u2018soft\u2019 in the head. Full of curiosity and anxious to have more light thrown upon so strange an incident, he came to see lier again a few days later. She received him in the most friendly fashion, because she was a good-natured woman, because the librarian was not there, because she had in mind the little play which Bloch was going to produce for her, and finally because she had acted once and for all the little scene of the indignant lady that she had wished to act, a scene that had been universally admired and discussed the same evening in various drawing-rooms, but in a version which had already ceased to bear any resemblance to the truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou were speaking just now of the Seven Princesses, Duchess; you know (not that it\u2019s anything to be proud of) that the author of that \u2014 what shall I call it? \u2014 that production is a compatriot of mine,\u201d said M. d\u2019Argencourt with a fine scorn blended with satisfaction at knowing more than anyone else in the room about the author of a work which had been under discussion. \u201cYes, he\u2019s a Belgian, by nationality,\u201d he went on\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed! No, we don\u2019t accuse you of any responsibility for the Seven Princesses. Fortunately for yourself and your compatriots you are not like the author of that absurdity. I know several charming Belgians, yourself, your King, who is inclined to be shy, but full of wit, my Ligne cousins, and heaps of others, but you, I am thankful to say, do not speak the same language as the author of the Seven Princesses. Besides, if you want to know, it\u2019s not worth talking about, because really there is absolutely nothing in it. You know the sort of people who are always trying to seem obscure, and even plan to make themselves ridiculous to conceal the fact that they have not an idea in their heads. If there was anything behind it all, I may tell you that I\u2019m not in the least afraid of a little daring,\u201d she added in a serious tone, \u201cprovided that there is some idea in it. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen Borelli\u2019s piece. Some people seem to have been shocked by it, but I must say, even if they stone me through the streets for saying it,\u201d she went on, without stopping to think that she ran no very great risk of such a punishment, \u201cI found it immensely interesting. But theSeven Princesses! It\u2019s all very well, one of them having a fondness for my nephew, I cannot carry family feeling quite . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duchess broke off abruptly, for a lady came in who was the Comtesse de Marsantes, Robert\u2019s mother. Mme. de Marsantes was regarded in the Faubourg Saint-Germain as a superior being, of a goodness, a resignation that were positively angelic. So I had been told, and had had no particular reason to feel surprised, not knowing at the same time that she was the sister of the Duc de Guermantes. Later, I have always been taken aback, whenever I have learned that such women, melancholy, pure, victimised, venerated like the ideal forms of saints in church windows, had flowered from the same genealogical stem as brothers brutal, debauched and vile. Brothers and sisters, when they are closely alike in features as were the pue de Guermantes and Mme. de Marsantes, ought (I felt) to have a single intellect in common, the same heart, as a person would have who might vary between good and evil moods but in whom one could not, for all that, expect to find a vast breadth of outlook if he had a narrow mind, or a sublime abnegation if his heart was hard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Marsantes attended Bruneti\u00e8re\u2019s lectures. She fascinated the Faubourg Saint-Germain and, by her saintly life, edified it as well. But the morphological link of handsome nose and piercing gaze led one, nevertheless, to classify Mme. de Marsantes in the same intellectual and moral family as her brother the Duke. I could not believe that the mere fact of her being a woman, and perhaps those of her having had an unhappy life and won everyone\u2019s sympathy, could make a person be so different from the rest of her family, as in the old romances, where all the virtues and graces are combined in the sister of wild and lawless brothers. It seemed to me that nature, less unconventional than the old poets, must make use almost exclusively of the elements common to the family, and I was unable to credit her with enough power of invention to construct, out of materials analogous to those that composed a fool and clod, a lofty mind without the least strain of clownishness, a saint unsoiled by any brutality. Mme. de Marsantes was wearing a gown of white surah embroidered with large palms, on which stood out flowers of a different material, these being black. This was because, three weeks earlier, she had lost her cousin, M. de Montmorency, a bereavement which did not prevent her from paying calls or even from going to small dinners, but always in mourning. She was a great lady. Atavism had filled her with the frivolity of generations of life at court, with all the superficial, rigorous duties that that implies. Mme. de Marsantes had not had the strength of character to regret for any length of time the death of her father and mother, but she would not for anything in the world have appeared in colours in the month following that of a cousin. She was more than pleasant to me, both because I was Robert\u2019s friend and because I did not move in the same world as he. This pleasantness was accompanied by a pretence of shyness, by that sort of intermittent withdrawal of the voice, the eyes, the mind which a woman draws back to her like a skirt that has indiscreetly spread, so as not to take up too much room, to remain stiff and erect even in her suppleness, as a good upbringing teaches. A good upbringing which must not, however, be taken too literally, many of these ladies passing very swiftly into a complete dissolution of morals without ever losing the almost childlike correctness of their manners. Mme. de Marsantes was a trifle irritating in conversation since, whenever she had occasion to speak of a plebeian, as for instance Bergotte or Elstir, she would say, isolating the word, giving it its full value, intoning it on two different notes with a modulation peculiar to the Guermantes: \u201cI have had the honour, the great hon-our of meeting Monsieur Bergotte,\u201d or \u201cof making the acquaintance of Monsieur Elstir\u201d whether that her hearers might marvel at her humility or from the sam tendency that Mme. de Guermantes shewed to revert to the use of obsolete forms, as a protest against the slovenly usages of the present day, in which people never professed themselves sufficiently \u2018honoured.\u2019 Whichever Of these was the true reason, one felt that when Mme. de Marsantes said: \u201cI have had the honour, the great hon-our,\u201d she felt she was playing an important part and shewing that she could take in the names of distinguished men as she would have welcomed the men themselves at her home in the country, had they happened to be in the neighbourhood. On the other hand as her family connexion was numerous, as she was devoted to all her relatives, as, slow in speech and fond of explaining things at length, she was always trying to make clear the exact degree of kinship, she found herself (without any desire to create an effect and without really caring to talk about anyone except touching peasants and sublime gamekeepers) referring incessantly to all the mediatised houses in Europe, a failing which people less brilliantly connected than herself could not forgive, and, if they were at all intellectual, derided as a sign of stupidity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the country, Mme. de Marsantes was adored for the good that she did, but principally because the purity of a strain of blood into which for many generations there had flowed only what was greatest in the history of France had taken from her manner everything that the lower orders call \u2018manners,\u2019 and had given her a perfect simplicity. She never shrank from kissing a poor woman who was in trouble, and would tell her to come up to the castle for a cartload of wood. She was, people said, the perfect Christian. She was determined to find an immensely rich wife for Robert. Being a great lady means playing the great lady, that is to say, to a certain extent, playing at simplicity. It is a pastime which costs an extremely high price, all the more because simplicity charms people only on condition that they know that you are not bound to live simply, that is to say that you are very rich. Some one said to me afterwards, when I had told him of my meeting her: \u201cYou saw of course that she must have been lovely as a young woman.\u201d But true beauty is so individual, so novel always, that one does not recognise it as beauty. I said to myself this afternoon only that she had a tiny nose, very blue eyes, a long neck and a sad expression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to the Duchesse de Guermantes, \u201cI\u2019m expecting a woman at any moment whom you don\u2019t wish to know. I thought I\u2019d better warn you, to avoid any unpleasantness. But you needn\u2019t be afraid, I shall never have her here again, only I was obliged to let her come to-day. It\u2019s Swann\u2019s wife.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Swann, seeing the dimensions that the Dreyfus case had begun to assume, and fearing that her husband\u2019s racial origin might be used against herself, had besought him never again to allude to the prisoner\u2019s innocence. When he was not present she went farther and used to profess the most ardent Nationalism; in doing which she was only following the example of Mme. Verdurin, in whom a middle-class anti-semitism, latent hitherto, had awakened and grown to a positive fury. Mme. Swann had won by this attitude the privilege of membership in several of the women\u2019s leagues that were beginning to be formed in anti-semitic society, and had succeeded in making friends with various members of the aristocracy. It may seem strange that, so far from following their example, the Duchesse de Guermantes, so close a friend of Swann, had on the contrary always resisted his desire, which he had not concealed from her, to introduce to her his wife. But we shall see in due course that this arose from the peculiar nature of the Duchess, who held that she was not \u2018bound to\u2019 do things, and laid down with despotic force what had been decided by her social \u2018free will,\u2019 which was extremely arbitrary\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cIt would indeed be most unpleasant. But as I know her by sight I shall be able to get away in time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI assure you, Oriane, she is really quite nice; an excellent woman,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have no doubt she is, but I feel no need to assure myself of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you been invited to Lady Israels\u2019s?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis asked the Duchess, to change the conversation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, thank heaven, I don\u2019t know the woman,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cYou must ask Marie-Aynard. She knows her. I never could make out why.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI did indeed know her at one time,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes. \u201cI confess my faults. But I have decided not to know her any more. It seems she\u2019s one of the very worst of them, and makes no attempt to conceal it. Besides, we have all been too trusting, too hospitable. I shall never go near anyone of that race again. While we had old friends, country cousins, people of our own flesh and blood on whom we shut our doors, we threw them open to Jews. And now we see what thanks we get from them. But I\u2019ve no right to speak; I have an adorable son, and, like a young fool, he says and does all the maddest things you can imagine,\u201d she went on, having caught some allusion by M. d\u2019Argencourt to Robert. \u201cBut, talking of Robert, haven\u2019t you seen him?\u201d she asked Mme. de Villeparisis; \u201cbeing Saturday, I thought he\u2019d be coming to Paris on leave, and in that case he would be sure to pay you a visit.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact Mme. de Marsantes thought that her son would not obtain leave that week; but knowing that, even if he did, he would never dream of coming to see Mme. de Villeparisis, she hoped, by making herself appear to have expected to find him in the room, to procure his forgiveness from her susceptible aunt for all the visits that he had failed to pay her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert here! But I have never had a single word from him; I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen him since Balbec.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe is so busy; he has so much to do,\u201d pleaded Mme. de Marsantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A faint smile made Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s eyelashes quiver as she studied the circle which, with the point of her sunshade, she was tracing on the carpet. Whenever the Duke had been too openly unfaithful to his wife, Mme. de Marsantes had always taken up the cudgels against her own brother on her sister-in-law\u2019s behalf. The latter had a grateful and bitter memory of this protection, and was not herself seriously shocked by Robert\u2019s pranks. At this point the door opened again and Robert himself entered the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, talk of the Saint!\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Marsantes, who had her back to the door, had not seen her son come in. When she did catch sight of him, her motherly bosom was convulsed with joy, as by the beating of a wing, her body half rose her seat, her face quivered and she fastened on Robert eyes big astonishment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat! You\u2019ve come! How delightful! What a surprise!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Talk of the Saint! \u2014 I see,\u201d cried the Belgian diplomat, with a shout of laughter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDelicious, ain\u2019t it?\u201d came tartly from the Duchess, who hated puns and had ventured on this one only with a pretence of making fun of herself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood afternoon, Robert,\u201d she said, \u201cI believe he\u2019s forgotten his aunt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They talked for a moment, probably about myself, for as Saint-Loup was leaving her to join his mother Mme. de Guermantes turned to me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood afternoon; how are you?\u201d was her greeting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She allowed to rain on me the light of her azure gaze, hesitated for a moment, unfolded and stretched towards me the stem of her arm, leaned forward her body which sprang rapidly backwards like a bush that has been pulled down to the ground and, on being released, returns to its natural position. Thus she acted under the fire of Saint-Loup\u2019s eyes, which kept her under observation and were making frantic efforts to obtain some further concession still from his aunt. Fearing that our conversation might fail altogether, he joined in, to stimulate it, and answered for me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s not very well just now, he gets rather tired; I think he would be a great deal better, by the way, if he saw you more often, for I can\u2019t help telling you that he admires you immensely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but that\u2019s very nice of him,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes in a deliberately casual tone, as if I had brought her her cloak. \u201cI am most flattered.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLook, I must go and talk to my mother for a minute; take my chair,\u201d said Saint-Loup, thus forcing me to sit down next to his aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were both silent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI see you sometimes in the morning,\u201d she said, as though she were telling me something that I did not know, and I for my part had never seen her. \u201cIt\u2019s so good for one, a walk.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOriane,\u201d began Mme. de Marsantes in a low tone, \u201cyou said you were going on to Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\u2019s; would you be so very kind as to tell her not to expect me to dinner, I shall stay at home now that I\u2019ve got Robert. And one other thing, but I hardly like to ask you, if you would leave word as you pass to tell them to send out at once for a box of the cigars Robert likes. \u2018Corona,\u2019 they\u2019re called. I\u2019ve none in the house.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert came up to us; he had caught only the name of Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho in the world is Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol?\u201d he inquired, in a sur \u2014 prised but decisive tone, for he affected a studied ignorance of everything to do with society\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, my dear boy, you know quite well,\u201d said his mother. \u201cShe\u2019s Vermandois\u2019s sister. It was she gave you that nice billiard table you liked so much.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat, she\u2019s Vermandois\u2019s sister, I had no idea of that. Really, my family are amazing,\u201d he went on, turning so as to include me in the conversation and adopting unconsciously Bloch\u2019s intonation just as he borrowed his ideas, \u201cthey know the most unheard-of people, people called Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\u201d (emphasising the final consonant of each word) \u201cand names like that; they go to balls, they drive in victorias, they lead a fabulous existence. It\u2019s prodigious.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes made in her throat a slight, short, sharp sound, as of an involuntary laugh which one chokes back, meaning thereby to shew that she paid just as much tribute as the laws of kinship imposed on her to her nephew\u2019s wit. A servant came in to say that the Prince von Faffenheim-Munsterburg-Weinigen had sent word to M. de Norpois that he was waiting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBring him in, sir,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to the old Ambassador, who started in quest of the German Minister\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStop, sir; do you think I ought to shew him the miniature of the Empress Charlotte?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be delighted,\u201d said the Ambassador in a tone of conviction, and as though he were envying the fortunate Minister the favour that was in store for him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, I know he\u2019s very sound,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes, \u201cand that is so rare among foreigners. But I\u2019ve found out all about him. He is anti-semitism personified.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Prince\u2019s name preserved in the boldness with which its opening syllables were \u2014 to borrow an expression from music \u2014 attacked, and in the stammering repetition that scanned them, the impulse, the mannered simplicity, the heavy delicacies of the Teutonic race, projected like green boughs over the \u2018heim\u2019 of dark blue enamel which glowed with the mystic light of a Rhenish window behind the pale and finely wrought gildings of the German eighteenth century. This name included, among the several names of which it was composed, that of a little German watering-place to which as a child I had gone with my grandmother, at the foot of a mountain honoured by the feet of Goethe, from the vineyards of which we used to drink, at the Kurhof, their illustrious vintages with elaborate and sonorous names, like the epithets which Homer applies to his heroes. And so, scarcely had I heard the Prince\u2019s name spoken than, before I had recalled the watering-place, the name itself seemed to shrink, to grow rich with humanity, to find large enough a little place in my memory to which it clung, familiar, earth to earth, picturesque, savoury, light, with something about it, too, that was authorised, prescribed. And then, M. de Guermantes, in explaining who the Prince was, quoted a number of his titles, and I recognised the name of a village threaded by the river on which, every evening, my cure finished for the day, I used to go in a boat amid the mosquitoes, and that of a forest so far away that the doctor would not allow me to make the excursion to it. And indeed it was comprehensible that the suzerainty of the lord extended to the surrounding places and associated afresh in the enumeration of his titles the names which one could read, close together, upon a map. Thus beneath the visor of the Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and Knight of Franconia it was the face of a dear and smiling land, on which had often lingered for me the light of the six-o\u2019clock sun, that I saw, at any rate before the Prince, Rheingraf and Elector Palatine had entered the room. For I speedily learned that the revenues which he drew from the forest and river, peopled with gnomes and undines, and from the enchanted mountain on which rose the ancient Burg that cherished memories of Luther and Lewis the Germanic, he employed in keeping five Charron motor-cars, a house in Paris and one in London, a box on Mondays at the Opera and another for the \u2018Tuesdays\u2019 at the \u2018Fran\u00e7ais.\u2019 He did not seem to me, nor did he seem to regard himself as different from other men of similar fortune and age who had a less poetic origin. He had their culture, their ideals, he was proud of his rank, but purely on account of the advantages it conferred on him, and had now only one ambition in life, to be elected a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, which was the reason of his coming to see Mme. de Villeparisis. If he, whose wife was a leader of the most exclusive set in Berlin, had begged to be introduced to the Marquise, it was not the result of any desire on his part for her acquaintance. Devoured for years past by this ambition to be elected to the Institute, he had unfortunately never been in a position to reckon above five the number of Academicians who seemed prepared to vote for him. He knew that M. de Norpois could by himself dispose of at least ten others, a number which he was capable, by skilful negotiations, of increasing still further. And so the Prince, who had known him in Russia when they were both there as Ambassadors, had gone to see him and had done everything in his power to win him over. But in vain might he multiply his friendly overtures, procure for the Marquis Russian decorations, quote him in articles on foreign politics; he had had before him an ingrate, a man in whose eyes all these attentions appeared to count as nothing, who had not advanced the prospects of his candidature one inch, had not even promised him his own vote. No doubt M. de Norpois received him with extreme politeness, indeed begged that he would not put himself out and \u201ctake the trouble to come so far out of his way,\u201d went himself to the Prince\u2019s residence, and when the Teutonic Knight had launched his: \u201cI should like immensely to be your colleague,\u201d replied in a tone of deep emotion: \u201cAh! I should be most happy!\u201d And no doubt a simpleton, a Dr. Cottard would have said to himself: \u201cWell, here he is in my house; it was he who insisted on coming, because he regards me as a more important person than himself; he tells me that he would be happy to see me in the Academy; words do have some meaning after all, damn it, probably if he doesn\u2019t offer to vote for me it is because it hasn\u2019t occurred to him. He lays so much stress on my great influence; presumably he imagines that larks drop into my mouth ready roasted, that I have all the support I want, and that is why he doesn\u2019t offer me his; but I have only got to get him with his back to the wall, and just say to him quietly: \u2018Very well, vote for me, will you?\u2019 and he will be obliged to do it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Prince von Faffenheim was no simpleton. He was what Dr. Cottard would have called \u2018a fine diplomat\u2019 and he knew that M. de Norpois was no less fine a one than himself, nor a man who would have failed to realise without needing to be told that he could confer a favour on a candidate by voting for him. The Prince, in his Embassies and as Foreign Minister, had conducted, on his country\u2019s behalf instead of, as in the present instance, his own, many of those conversations in which one knows beforehand just bow far one is prepared to go and at what point one will decline to commit oneself. He was not unaware that, in this diplomatic language, to talk meant to offer. And it was for this reason that he had arranged for M. de Norpois to receive the Cordon of Saint Andrew. But if he had had to report to his Government the conversation which he had subsequently had with M. de Norpois, he would have stated in his dispatch: \u201cI realised that I had gone the wrong way to work.\u201d For as soon as he had returned to the subject of the Institute, M. de Norpois had repeated:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should like nothing better; nothing could be better, for my colleagues. They ought, I consider, to feel genuinely honoured that you should have thought of them. It is a really interesting candidature, a little outside our ordinary course. As you know, the Academy is very conventional, it takes fright at everything which has at all a novel sound. Personally, I deplore this. How often have I had occasion to say as much to my colleagues! I cannot be sure, God forgive me, that I did not even once let the word \u2018hidebound\u2019 escape me,\u201d he added, in an undertone, with a scandalised smile, almost aside, as in a scene on the stage, casting at the Prince a rapid, sidelong glance from his blue eyes, like a veteran actor studying the effect on his audience. \u201cYou understand, Prince, that I should not care to allow a personality so eminent as yourself to embark on a venture which was hopeless from the start. So long as my colleagues\u2019 ideas linger so far behind the times, I consider that the wiser course will be to abstain. But you may rest assured that if I were ever to discern a mind that was a little more modern, a little more alive, shewing itself in that college, which is tending to become a mausoleum, if I could reckon upon any possible chance of your success, I should be the first to inform you of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Cordon was a mistake,\u201d thought the Prince; \u201cthe negotiations have not advanced in the least; that is not what he wanted. I have not yet laid my hand on the right key.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was a kind of reasoning of which M. de Norpois, formed in the same school as the Prince, would also have been capable. One may mock at the Pedantic silliness with which diplomats of the Norpois type go into ecstasies over some piece of official wording which is, for all practical purposes, meaningless. But their childishness has this compensation; diplomats know that, in the loaded scales which assure that European or other equilibrium which we call peace, good feeling, sounding speeches, earnest entreaties weigh very little; and that the heavy weight, the true determinant consists in something else, in the possibility which the adversary does (if he is strong enough) or does not enjoy of satisfying, in exchange for what one oneself wants, a desire. With this order of truths, which an entirely disinterested person, such as my grandmother for instance, would not have understood M. de Norpois and Prince von Faffenheim had frequently had to deal. Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires in countries with which we had been within an ace of going to war, M. de Norpois, in his anxiety as to the turn which events were about to take, knew very well that it was not by the word \u2018Peace,\u2019 nor by the word \u2018War\u2019 that it would be revealed to him, but by some other, apparently commonplace word, a word of terror or blessing, which the diplomat, by the aid of his cipher, would immediately read and to which, to safeguard the honour of France, he would respond in another word, quite as commonplace, but one beneath which the Minister of the enemy nation would at once see written: \u2018War.\u2019 Moreover, in accordance with a time-honoured custom, analogous to that which gave to the first meeting between two young people promised to one another in marriage the form of a chance encounter at a performance in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Gymnase, the dialogue in the course of which destiny was to dictate the word \u2018War\u2019 or the word \u2018Peace\u2019 was held, as a rule, not in the ministerial sanctum but on a bench in a Kurgarten where the Minister and M. de Norpois went independently to a thermal spring to drink at its source their little tumblers of some curative water. By a sort of tacit convention they met at the hour appointed for their cure, began by taking together a short stroll which, beneath its innocent appearance, each of the speakers knew to be as tragic as an order for mobilisation. And so, in a private matter like this nomination for election to the Institute, the Prince had employed the same system of induction which had served him in his public career, the same method of reading beneath superimposed symbols\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And certainly it would be wrong to pretend that my grandmother and the few who resembled her would have been alone in their failure to understand this kind of calculation. For one thing, the average human being, practising a profession the lines of which have been laid down for him from the start, comes near, by his want of intuition, to the ignorance which my grandmother owed to her lofty disinterestedness. Often one has to come down to \u2018kept\u2019 persons, male or female, before one finds the hidden spring of actions or words apparently of the most innocent nature in self-interest, in the bare necessity to keep alive. What man does not know that when a woman whom he is going to pay says to him: \u201cDon\u2019t let\u2019s talk about money,\u201d the speech must be regarded as what is called in music \u2018a silent beat\u2019 and that if, later on, she declares: \u201cYou are far too much trouble; you are always keeping things from me; I\u2019ve done with you,\u201d he must interpret this as: \u201cSome one else has been offering me more.\u201d And yet this is only the language of a lady of easy virtue, not so far removed from the ladies in society. The apache furnishes more striking examples. But M. as Norpois and the German Prince, if apaches and their ways were unknown to them, had been accustomed to living on the same plane as nations, which are also, despite their greatness, creatures of selfishness and cunning, kept in order only by force, by consideration of their material interests which may drive them to murder, a murder that is often symbolic also, since its mere hesitation or refusal to fight may spell for a nation the word \u2018Perish. But inasmuch as all this is not set forth in Yellow and otherwise coloured Books, the people as a whole are naturally pacific; should they be warlike, it is instinctively, from hatred, from a sense of injury, not for the reasons which have made up the mind of their ruler, on the advice of his Norpois\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following winter the Prince was seriously ill; he recovered, but his heart was permanently affected\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe devil!\u201d he said to himself, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to lose any time over the Institute. If I wait too long, I may be dead before they elect me. That really would be unpleasant.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He composed, on the foreign politics of the last twenty years, an essay for the Revue des Deux Mondes, in which he referred more than once, and in the most flattering terms, to M. de Norpois. The French diplomat called upon him to thank him. He added that he did not know how to express his gratitude. The Prince said to himself, like a man who has been trying to fit various keys into a stubborn lock: \u201cStill not the right one!\u201d and, feeling somewhat out of breath as he shewed M. de Norpois to the door, thought: \u201cDamn it, these fellows will see me in my grave before letting me in. We must hurry up.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That evening, he met M. de Norpois again at the Opera\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear Ambassador,\u201d he began to him, \u201cyou told me to-day that you did not know what you could do to prove your gratitude; it was a great exaggeration, for you owe me none, but I am going to be so indelicate as to take you at your word.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois had no less high an esteem for the Prince\u2019s tact than the Prince had for his. He understood at once that it was not a request that Prince von Faffenheim was about to present to him, but an offer, and with a radiant affability made ready to hear it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell now, you will think me highly indiscreet. There are two people to whom I am greatly attached \u2014 in quite different ways, as you will understand in a moment \u2014 two people both of whom have recently settled in Paris, where they intend to remain for the future: my wife, and the Grand Duchess John. They are thinking of giving a few dinners, chiefly in honour of the King and Queen of England, and what they would have liked more than anything in the world would have been to be able to offer their guests the company of a person for whom, without knowing her, they both of them feel a great admiration. I confess that I did not know how I was going to gratify their wish when I learned just now, by the most extraordinary accident, that you were a friend of this person. I know that she lives a most retired life, and sees only a very few people \u2014\u2018happy few,\u2019 as Stendhal would say \u2014 but if you were to give me your backing, with the generosity that you have always shewn me, I am sure that she would allow you to present me to her and to convey to her the wishes of both the Grand Duchess and the Princess. Perhaps she would consent to dine with us, when the Queen of England comes, and then (one never knows) if we don\u2019t bore her too much, to spend the Easter holidays with us at Beaulieu, at the Grand Duchess John\u2019s. The person I allude to is called the Marquise de Villeparisis. I confess that the hope of becoming one of the frequenters of such a school of wit would console me, would make me contemplate without regret the abandoning of my attempt at the Institute. For in her house, too, I understand, there is a regular flow of intellect and brilliant talk.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With an inexpressible sense of pleasure the Prince felt that the lock no longer resisted, and that at last the key was turning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSuch an alternative is wholly unnecessary, my dear Prince,\u201d replied M. de Norpois; \u201cnothing is more in harmony with the Institute than the house you speak of, which is a regular hotbed of Academicians. I shall convey your request to Mme. la Marquise de Villeparisis: she will undoubtedly be flattered. As for her dining with you, she goes out very little and that will perhaps be more difficult to arrange. But I shall present you to her and you can plead your cause in person. You must on no account give up the Academy; to-morrow fortnight, as it happens, I shall be having luncheon, before going on with him to an important meeting, at Leroy-Beaulieu\u2019s, without whom nobody can be elected; I had already allowed myself in conversation with him to let fall your name, with which, naturally, he was perfectly familiar. He raised certain objections. But it so happens that he requires the support of my group at the next election, and I fully intend to return to the charge; I shall tell him quite openly of the wholly cordial ties that unite us, I shall not conceal from him that, if you were to stand, I should ask all my friends to vote for you,\u201d (here the Prince breathed a deep sigh of relief) \u201cand he knows that I have friends. I consider that if I were to succeed in obtaining his assistance your chances would become very strong. Come that evening, at six, to Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s; I will introduce you to her and I can give you an account then of my conversation with him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus it was that Prince von Faffenheim had been led to call upon Mme. de Villeparisis. My profound disillusionment occurred when he spoke. It had never struck me that, if an epoch in history has features both particular and general which are stronger than those of a nationality, so that in a biographical dictionary with illustrations, which go so far as to include an authentic portrait of Minerva, Leibniz with his wig and ruff differs little from Marivaux or Samuel Bernard, a nationality has particular features stronger than those of a caste. In the present instance these were rendered before me not by a discourse in which I had expected, before I saw him, to hear the rustling of the elves and the dance of the kobolds, but by a transposition which certified no less plainly that poetic origin: the fact that, as he bowed, short, red, corpulent, over the hand of Mme. de Villeparisis, the Rheingraf said to her: \u201cAow to you too, Matame la Marquise,\u201d in the accent of an Alsatian porter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWon\u2019t you let me give you a cup of tea or a little of this cake; it is so good?\u201d Mme. de Guermantes asked me, anxious to have shewn herself as friendly as possible. \u201cI do the honours in this house just as if it was mine,\u201d she explained in an ironical tone which gave a slightly guttural sound to her voice, as though she were trying to stifle a hoarse laugh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSir,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to M. de Norpois, \u201cyou won\u2019t forget that you have something to say to the Prince about the Academy?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes lowered her eyes and gave a semicircular turn to her wrist to look at the time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGracious! I must fly at once if I\u2019m to get to Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\u2019s, and I\u2019m dining with Mme. Leroi.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she rose without bidding me good-bye. She had just caught sight of Mme. Swann, who appeared considerably embarrassed at finding me in the room. She remembered, doubtless, that she had been the first to assure me that she was convinced of Dreyfus\u2019s innocence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t want my mother to introduce me to Mme. Swann,\u201d Saint-Loup said to me. \u201cShe\u2019s an ex-whore. Her husband\u2019s a Jew, and she comes here to pose as a Nationalist. Hallo, here\u2019s Uncle Palam\u00e8de.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The arrival of Mme. Swann had a special interest for me, due to an incident which had occurred a few days earlier and which I am obliged to record on account of the consequences which it was to have at a much later date, as the reader will learn in due course. Well, a few days before this visit to Mme. de Villeparisis, I had myself received a visitor whom I little expected, namely Charles Morel, the son (though I had never heard of his existence) of my great-uncle\u2019s old servant. This great-uncle (he in whose house I had met the lady in pink) had died the year before. His servant had more than once expressed his intention of coming to see me; I had no idea of the object of his visit, but should have been glad to see him for I had learned from Fran\u00e7oise that he had a genuine veneration for my uncle\u2019s memory and made a pilgrimage regularly to the cemetery in which he was buried. But, being obliged, for reasons of health, to retire to his home in the country, where he expected to remain for some time, he delegated the duty to his son. I was surprised to see come into my room a handsome young fellow of eighteen, dressed with expensive rather than good taste, but looking, all the same, like anything in the world except the son of a gentleman\u2019s servant. He made a point, moreover, at the start of our conversation, of severing all connexion with the domestic class from which he sprang, by informing me, with a smile of satisfaction, that he had won the first prize at the Conservatoire. The object of his visit to me was as follows: his father, when going through the effects of my uncle Adolphe, had set aside some which, he felt, could not very well be sent to my parents but were at the same time of a nature likely to interest a young man of my age. These were the photographs of the famous actresses, the notorious courtesans whom my uncle had known, the last fading pictures of that gay life of a man about town which he divided by a watertight compartment from his family life. While young Morel was shewing them to me, I noticed that he addressed me as though he were speaking to an equal. He derived from saying \u2018you\u2019 to me as often, and \u2018sir\u2019 as seldom, as possible the pleasure natural in one whose father had never ventured, when addressing my parents, upon anything but the third person. Almost all these photographs bore an inscription such as: \u201cTo my best friend.\u201d One actress, less grateful and more circumspect than the rest, had written: \u201cTo the best of friends,\u201d which enabled her (so I was assured) to say afterwards that my uncle was in no sense and had never been her best friend but was merely the friend who had done the most little services for her, the friend she made use of, a good, kind man, in other words an old fool. In vain might young Morel seek to divest himself of his lowly origin, one felt that the shade of my uncle Adolphe, venerable and gigantic in the eyes of the old servant, had never ceased to hover, almost a holy vision, over the childhood and boyhood of the son. While I was turning over the photographs Charles Morel examined my room. And as I was looking for some place in which I might keep them, \u201cHow is it,\u201d he asked me (in a tone in which the reproach had no need to find expression, so im, plicit was it in the words themselves), \u201cthat I don\u2019t see a single photograph of your uncle in your room?\u201d I felt the blood rise to my cheeks and stammered: \u201cWhy, I don\u2019t believe I have such a thing.\u201d \u201cWhat, you haven\u2019t one photograph of your uncle Adolphe, who was so devoted to you! I\u2014 will send you one of my governor\u2019s \u2014 he has quantities of them \u2014 and I hope you will set it up in the place of honour above that chest of drawers, which came to you from your uncle.\u201d It is true that, as I had not even a photograph of my father or mother in my room, there was nothing so very shocking in there not being one of my uncle Adolphe. But it was easy enough to see that for old Morel, who had trained his son in the same way of thinking, my uncle was the important person in the family, my parents only reflecting a diminished light from his. I was in higher favour, because my uncle used constantly to say that I was going to turn out a sort of Racine, or Vaulabelle, and Morel regarded me almost as an adopted son, as a child by election of my uncle. I soon discovered that this young man was extremely \u2018pushing.\u2019 Thus at this first meeting he asked me, being something of a composer as well and capable of setting short poems to music, whether I knew any poet who had a good position in society. I mentioned one. He did not know the work of this poet and had never heard his name, of which he made a note. Well, I found out that shortly afterwards he wrote to the poet telling him that, a fanatical admirer of his work, he, Morel, had composed a musical setting for one of his sonnets and would be grateful if the author would arrange for its performance at the Comtesse So-and-So\u2019s. This was going a little too fast, and exposing his hand. The poet, taking offence, made no reply\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the rest, Charles Morel seemed to have, besides his ambition, a strong leaning towards more concrete realities. He had noticed, as he came through the courtyard, Jupien\u2019s niece at work upon a waistcoat, and although he explained to me only that he happened to want a fancy waistcoat at that very moment, I felt that the girl had made a vivid impression on him. He had no hesitation about asking me to come downstairs and introduce him to her, \u201cbut not as a connexion of your family, you follow me, I rely on your discretion not to drag in my father, say just a distinguished artist of your acquaintance, you know how important it is to make a good impression on tradespeople.\u201d Albeit he had suggested to me that, not knowing him well enough to call him, he quite realised,\u2018dear friend,\u2019 I might address him, before the girl, in some such terms as \u201cnot dear master, of course,.. although . . . well, if you like, dear distinguished artist,\u201d once in the shop, I avoided \u2018qualifying\u2019 him, as Saint-Simon would have expressed it, and contented myself with reiterating his \u2018you.\u2019 He picked out from several patterns of velvet one of the brightest red imaginable and so loud that, for all his bad taste, he was never able to wear the waistcoat when it was made. The girl settled down to work again with her two \u2018apprentices,\u2019 but it struck me that the impression had been mutual, and that Charles Morel, whom she regarded as of her own \u2018station\u2019 (only smarter and richer), had proved singularly attractive to her. As I had been greatly surprised to find among the photographs which his father had sent me one of the portrait of Miss Sacripant (otherwise Odette) by Elstir, I said to Charles Morel as I went with him to the outer gate: \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you can tell me, but did my uncle know this lady well? I don\u2019t see at what stage in his life I can fit her in exactly; and it interests me, because of M. Swann . . . \u201d \u201cWhy, if I wasn\u2019t forgetting to tell you that my father asked me specially to draw your attention to that lady\u2019s picture. As a matter of fact, she was \u2018lunching\u2019 with your uncle the last time you ever saw him. My father was in two minds whether to let you in. It seems you made a great impression on the wench, and she hoped to see more of you. But just at that time there was some trouble in the family, by what my father tells me, and you never set eyes on your uncle again.\u201d He broke off with a smile of farewell, across the courtyard, at Jupien\u2019s niece. She was watching him and admiring, no doubt, his thin face and regular features, his fair hair and sparkling eyes. I, as I gave him my hand, was thinking of Mme. Swann and saying to myself with amazement, so far apart, so different were they in my memory, that I should have henceforth to identify her with the \u2018Lady in pink.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus was not long in taking his place by the side of Mme. Swann. At every social gathering at which he appeared and, contemptuous towards the men, courted by the women, promptly attached himself to the smartest of the latter, whose garments he seemed almost to put on as an ornament to his own, the Baron\u2019s frock coat or swallowtails made one think of a portrait by some great painter of a man dressed in black but having by his side, thrown over a chair, the brilliantly coloured cloak which he is about to wear at some costume ball. This partnership, generally with some royal lady, secured for M. de Charlus various privileges which he liked to enjoy. For instance, one result of it was that his hostesses, at theatricals or concerts, allowed the Baron alone to have a front seat, in a row of ladies, while the rest of the men were crowded together at the back of the room. And then besides, completely absorbed, it seemed, in repeating, at the top of his voice, amusing stories to the enraptured lady, M. de Charlus was dispensed from the necessity of going to shake hands with any of the others, was set free, in other words, from all social duties. Behind the scented barrier in which the beauty of his choice enclosed him, he was isolated amid a crowded drawing-room, as, in a crowded theatre or concert-hall, behind the rampart of a box; and when anyone came up to greet him, through, so to speak, the beauty of his companion, it was permissible for him to reply quite curtly and without interrupting his business of conversation with a lady. Certainly Mme. Swann was scarcely of the rank of the people with whom he liked thus to flaunt himself. But he professed admiration for her, friendship for Swann, he knew that she would be flattered by his attentions and was himself flattered at being compromised by the prettiest woman in the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis meanwhile was not too well pleased to receive a visit from M. de Charlus. He, while admitting serious defects in his aunt\u2019s character, was genuinely fond of her. But every now and then, carried away by anger, by an imaginary grievance, he would sit down and write to her without making any attempt to resist his impulse, letters full of the most violent abuse, in which in made the most of trifling incidents which until then he seemed never even to have noticed. Among other examples I may instance the following, which my stay at Balbec brought to my knowledge-Mme. de Villeparisis, fearing that she had not brought enough money with her to Balbec to enable her to prolong her holiday there, and not caring since she was of a thrifty disposition and shrank from unnecessary expenditure, to have money sent to her from Paris, had borrowed three thousand francs from M. de Charlus. A month later, annoyed, for some trivial reason, with his aunt, he asked her to repay him this sum by telegraph. He received two thousand nine hundred and ninety-odd francs. Meeting his aunt a few days later in Paris, in the course of a friendly conversation, he drew her attention, with the utmost politeness, to the mistake that her banker had made when sending the money. \u201cBut there was no mistake,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cthe money order cost six francs seventy-five.\u201d \u201cOh, of course, if it was intentional, it is all right,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cI mentioned it only in case you didn\u2019t know, because in that case, if the bank had done the same thing with anyone who didn\u2019t know you as well as I do, it might have led to unpleasantness.\u201d \u201cNo, no, there was no mistake.\u201d \u201cAfter all, you were quite right,\u201d M. de Charlus concluded easily, stooping to kiss his aunt\u2019s hand. And in fact he bore no resentment and was only amused at this little instance of her thrift. But some time afterwards, imagining that, in a family matter, his aunt had been trying to get the better of him and had \u2018worked up a regular conspiracy\u2019 against him, as she took shelter, foolishly enough, behind the lawyers with whom he suspected her of having plotted to undo him, he had written her a letter boiling over with insolence and rage. \u201cI shall not be satisfied with having my revenge,\u201d he added as a postscript; \u201cI shall take care to make you a laughing-stock. Tomorrow I shall tell everyone the story of the money order and the six francs seventy-five you kept back from me out of the three thousand I lent you; I shall disgrace you publicly.\u201d Instead of so doing, he had gone to his aunt the next day to beg her pardon, having already regretted a letter in which he had used some really terrible language. But apart from this, to whom could he have told the story of the money order? Seeking no longer vengeance but a sincere reconciliation, now was the time for him to keep silence. But already he had repeated the story everywhere, while still on the best of terms with his aunt; he had told it without any malice, as a joke, and because he was the soul of indiscretion. He had repeated the story, but without Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s knowledge. With the result that, having learned from his letter that he intended to disgrace her by making public a transaction in which he had told her with his own lips that she had acted rightly, she concluded that he had been deceiving her from the first, and had lied when he pretended to be fond of her. This storm had now died down, but neither of them knew what opinion exactly the other had of her or him. This sort of intermittent quarrel is of course somewhat exceptional. Of a different order were the quarrels of Bloch and his friends. Of a dif \u2014 ferent order again were those of M. de Charlus, as we shall presently see, with people wholly unlike Mme. de Villeparisis. In spite of which we must bear in mind that the opinions which we hold of one another, our relations with friends and kinsfolk, are in no sense permanent, save in appearance, but are as eternally fluid as the sea itself. Whence all the rumours of divorce between couples who have always seemed so perfectly united and will soon afterwards speak of one another with affection, hence all the terrible things said by one friend of another from whom we supposed him to be inseparable and with whom we shall find him once more reconciled before we have had time to recover from our surprise; all the ruptures of alliances, after so short a time, between nations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, my uncle and Mme. Swann are getting warm over there!\u201d remarked Saint-Loup. \u201cAnd look at Mamma in the innocence of her heart going across to disturb them. To the pure all things are pure, I suppose!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I studied M. de Charlus. The tuft of his grey hair, his eye, the brow of which was raised by his monocle to emit a smile, the red flowers in his buttonhole formed, so to speak, the three mobile apices of a convulsive and striking triangle. I had not ventured to bow to him, for he had given me no sign of recognition. And yet, albeit he had not turned his head in my direction, I was convinced that he had seen me; while he repeated some story to Mme. Swann, whose sumptuous, pansy-coloured cloak floated actually over the Baron\u2019s knee, his roving eye, like that of a street hawker who is watching all the time for the \u2018tecs\u2019 to appear, had certainly explored every corner of the room and taken note of all the people who were in it. M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault came up to bid him good day without any indication on M. de Charlus\u2019s face that he had seen the young Duke until he was actually standing in front of him. In this way, in fairly numerous gatherings such as this, M. de Charlus kept almost continuously on show a smile without any definite direction or particular object, which, pre-existing before the greetings of new arrivals, found itself, when these entered its zone, devoid of any indication of friendliness towards them. Nevertheless, it was obviously my duty to go across and speak to Mme. Swann. But as she was not certain whether I already knew Mme. de Marsantes and M. de Charlus, she was distinctly cold, fearing no doubt that I might ask her to introduce me to them. I then made my way to M. de Charlus, and at once regretted it, for though he could not have helped seeing me he shewed no sign whatsoever. As I stood before him and bowed I found standing out from his body, which it prevented me from approaching by the full length of his outstretched arm, a finger widowed, one would have said, of an episcopal ring, of which he appeared to be offering, for the kiss of the faithful, the consecrated site, and I was made to appear to have penetrated, without leave from the Baron and by an act of trespass for which he would hold me permanently responsible, the anonymous and vacant dispersion of his smile. This coldness was hardly of a kind to encourage Mme. Swann to melt from hers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow tired and worried you look,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes to her son who had come up to greet M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And indeed the expression in Robert\u2019s eyes seemed every minute to reach a depth from which it rose at once like a diver who has touched bottom This bottom which hurt Robert so when he touched it that he left it at once, to return to it a moment later, was the thought that he had quarrelled with his mistress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNever mind,\u201d his mother went on, stroking his cheek, \u201cnever mind; it\u2019s good to see my little boy again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this show of affection seeming to irritate Robert, Mme. de Marsantes led her son away to the other end of the room where in an alcove hung with yellow silk a group of Beauvais armchairs massed their violet-hued tapestries like purple irises in a field of buttercups. Mme. Swann, finding herself alone and having realised that I was a friend of Saint-Loup, beckoned to me to come and sit beside her. Not having seen her for so long I did not know what to talk to her about. I was keeping an eye on my hat, among the crowd of hats that littered the carpet, and I asked myself with a vague curiosity to whom one of them could belong which was not that of the Duc de Guermantes and yet in the lining of which a capital \u2018G\u2019 was surmounted by a ducal coronet. I knew who everyone in the room was, and could not think of anyone whose hat this could possibly be\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a pleasant man M. de Norpois is,\u201d I said to Mme. Swann, looking at the Ambassador. \u201cIt is true, Robert de Saint-Loup says he\u2019s a pest, but . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe is quite right,\u201d she replied\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seeing from her face that she was thinking of something which she was keeping from me, I plied her with questions. For the satisfaction of appearing to be greatly taken up by some one in this room where she knew hardly anyone, she took me into a corner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am sure this is what M. de Saint-Loup meant,\u201d she began, \u201cbut you must never tell him I said so, for he would think me indiscreet, and I value his esteem very highly; I am an \u2018honest Injun,\u2019 don\u2019t you know. The other day, Charlus was dining at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s; I don\u2019t know how it was, but your name was mentioned. M. de Norpois seems to have told them \u2014 it\u2019s all too silly for words, don\u2019t go and worry yourself to death over it, nobody paid any attention, they all knew only too well the mischievous tongue that said it \u2014 that you were a hypocritical little flatterer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have recorded a long way back my stupefaction at the discovery that a friend of my father, such as M. de Norpois was, could have expressed himself thus in speaking of me. I was even more astonished to learn that my emotion on that evening long ago when I had asked him about Mme. Swann and Gilberte was known to the Princesse de Guermantes, whom I imagined never to have heard of my existence. Each of our actions, our words, our attitudes is cut off from the \u2018world,\u2019 from the people who have not directly perceived it, by a medium the permeability of which is of infinite variation and remains unknown to ourselves; having learned by experience that some important utterance which we eagerly hoped would be disseminated (such as those so enthusiastic speeches which I used at one time to make to all comers and on every occasion on the subject of Mme. Swann) has found itself, often simply on account of our anxiety, immediately hidden under a bushel, how immeasurably less do we suppose that some tiny word, which we ourselves have forgotten, or else a word never ottered by us but formed on its course by the imperfect refraction of a different word, can be transported without ever halting for any obstacle to infinite distances \u2014 in the present instance to the Princesse de Guermantes \u2014 and succeed in diverting at our expense the banquet of the gods. What we actually recall of our conduct remains unknown to our nearest neighbour; what we have forgotten that we ever said, or indeed what we never did say, flies to provoke hilarity even in another planet, and the image that other people form of our actions and behaviour is no more like that which we form of them ourselves, than is like an original drawing a spoiled copy in which, at one point, for a black line, we find an empty gap, and for a blank space an unaccountable contour. It may be, all the same, that what has not been transcribed is some non-existent feature which we behold merely in our purblind self-esteem, and that what seems to us added is indeed a part of ourselves, but so essential a part as to have escaped our notice. So that this strange print which seems to us to have so little resemblance to ourselves bears sometimes the same stamp of truth, scarcely flattering, indeed, but profound and useful, as a photograph taken by X-rays. Not that that is any reason why we should recognise ourselves in it. A man who is in the habit of smiling in the glass at his handsome face and stalwart figure, if you shew him their radiograph, will have, face to face with that rosary of bones, labelled as being the image of himself, the same suspicion of error as the visitor to an art gallery who, on coming to the portrait of a girl, reads in his catalogue: \u201cDromedary resting.\u201d Later on, this discrepancy between our portraits, according as it was our own hand that drew them or another, I was to register in the case of others than myself, living placidly in the midst of a collection of photographs which they themselves had taken while round about them grinned frightful faces, invisible to them as a rule, but plunging them in stupor if an accident were to reveal them with the warning: \u201cThis is you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few years earlier I should have been only too glad to tell Mme. Swann in what connexion I had fawned upon M. de Norpois, since the connexion had been my desire to know her. But I no longer felt this desire, I was no longer in love with Gilberte. On the other hand I had not succeeded in identifying Mme. Swann with the lady in pink of my childhood. Accordingly I spoke of the woman who was on my mind at the moment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDid you see the Duchesse de Guermantes just now?\u201d I asked Mme. Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But since the Duchess did not bow to Mme. Swann when they met, the latter chose to appear to regard her as a person of no importance, whose presence in a room one did not even remark\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know; I didn\u2019t realise her,\u201d she replied sourly, using an expression borrowed from England\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was anxious nevertheless for information with regard not only to Mme. de Guermantes but to all the people who came in contact with her, and (for all the world like Bloch), with the tactlessness of people who seek in their conversation not to give pleasure to others but to elucidate, from sheer egoism, facts that are interesting to themselves, in my effort to form an exact idea of the life of Mme. de Guermantes I questioned Mme de Villeparisis about Mme. Leroi\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, yes, I know who\u2019 you mean,\u201d she replied with an affectation of contempt, \u201cthe daughter of those rich timber people. I\u2019ve heard that she\u2019s begun to go about quite a lot lately, but I must explain to you that I am rather old now to make new acquaintances. I have known such interesting such delightful people in my time that really I do not believe Mme. Lerol would be any addition to what I already have.\u201d Mme. de Marsantes, who was playing lady in waiting to the Marquise, presented me to the Prince and, while she was still doing so, M. de Norpois also presented me in the most glowing terms. Perhaps he found it convenient to do me a courtesy which could in no way damage his credit since I had just been presented, perhaps it was because he thought that a foreigner, even so distinguished a foreigner, was unfamiliar with French society and might think that he was having introduced to him a young man of fashion, perhaps to exercise one of his prerogatives, that of adding the weight of his personal recommendation as an Ambassador, or in his taste for the archaic to revive in the Prince\u2019s honour the old custom, flattering to his rank, that two sponsors were necessary if one wished to be presented\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis appealed to M. de Norpois, feeling it imperative that I should have his assurance that she had nothing to regret in not knowing Mme. Leroi\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAm I not right, M. l\u2019Ambassadeur, Mme. Leroi is quite uninteresting, isn\u2019t she, quite out of keeping with the people who come here; I was quite right not to make friends with her, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether from independence or because he was tired, M. de Norpois replied merely in a bow full of respect but devoid of meaning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSir,\u201d went on Mme. de Villeparisis with a laugh, \u201cthere are some absurd people in the world. Would you believe that I had a visit this afternoon from a gentleman who tried to persuade me that he found more pleasure in kissing my hand than a young woman\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I guessed at once that this was Legrandin. M. de Norpois smiled with a slight quiver of the eyelid, as though such a remark had been prompted by a concupiscence so natural that one could not find fault with the person who had uttered it, almost as though it were the beginning of a romance which he was prepared to forgive, if not to encourage, with the perverse indulgence of a Voisenon or the younger Cr\u00e9billon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMany young women\u2019s hands would be incapable of doing what I see there,\u201d said the Prince, pointing to Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s unfinished water-colours. And he asked her whether she had seen the flower paintings by Fantin-Latour which had recently been exhibited\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey are of the first order, and indicate, as people say nowadays, a fine painter, one of the masters of the palette,\u201d declared M. de Norpois; \u201cI consider, all the same, that they stand no comparison with these, in which I find it easier to recognise the colouring of the flower.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even supposing that the partiality of an old lover, the habit of flattering people, the critical standard admissible in a small circle, had dictated this speech to the ex-Ambassador, it proved upon what an absolute vacuum of true taste the judgment of people in society is based, so arbitrary that the smallest trifle can make it rush to the wildest absurdities, on the way to which it is stopped, held up by no genuinely felt impression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI claim no credit for knowing about flowers, I\u2019ve lived all my life among the fields,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis modestly. \u201cBut,\u201d she added graciously, turning to the Prince, \u201cif I did, when I was quite a girl, form a rather more serious idea of them than children generally do in the country, I owe that to a distinguished fellow-countryman of yours, Herr von Schlegel. I met him at Broglie, when I was staying there once with my aunt Cordelia (Marshal de Castellane\u2019s wife, don\u2019t you know?). I remember so well M. Lebrun, M. de Salvandy, M. Doudan, getting him to talk about flowers. I was only a little girl, I wasn\u2019t able to follow all he said. But he liked playing with me, and when he went back to your country he sent me a beautiful botany book to remind me of a drive we took together in a phaeton to the Val Richer, when I fell asleep on his knee. I have got the book still, and it taught me to observe many things about flowers which I should not have noticed otherwise. When Mme. de Barante published some of Mme. de Broglie\u2019s letters, charming and affected like herself, I hoped to find among them some record of those conversations with Herr von Schlegel. But she was a woman who looked for nothing from nature but arguments in support of religion.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert called me away to the far end of the room where he and his mother were\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou have been good to me,\u201d I said, \u201chow can I thank you? Can we dine together to-morrow?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo-morrow? Yes, if you like, but it will have to be with Bloch. I met him just now on the doorstep; he was rather stiff with me at first because I had quite forgotten to answer his last two letters. (At least, he didn\u2019t tell me that that was what had annoyed him, but I guessed it.) But after that he was so friendly to me that I simply can\u2019t disappoint him. Between ourselves, on his side at least, I can feel it\u2019s a life and death friendship.\u201d Nor do I consider that Robert was altogether mistaken. Furious detraction was often, with Bloch, the effect of a keen affection which he had supposed to be unreturned. And as he had little power of imagining the lives of other people, and never dreamed that one might have been ill, or away from home, or otherwise occupied, a week\u2019s silence was at once interpreted by him as meaning a deliberate coldness. And so I have never believed that his most violent outbursts as a friend, or in later years as a writer, went very deep. They rose to a paroxysm if one replied to them with an icy dignity, or by a platitude which encouraged him to redouble his onslaught, but yielded often to a warmly sympathetic attitude. \u201cAs for being good,\u201d went on Saint-Loup, \u201cyou say I have been to you, but I haven\u2019t been good at all, my aunt tells me that it\u2019s you who avoid her, that you never said a word to her. She wondered whether you had anything against her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately for myself, if I had been taken in by this speech, our departure, which I believed to be imminent, for Balbec would have prevented my making any attempt to see Mme. Guermantes again, to assure her that I had nothing against her, and so to put her under the necessity of proving that it was she who had something against me. But I had only to remind myself that she had not even offered to let me see her Elstirs. Besides, this was not a disappointment; I had never expected her to begin talking to me about them; I knew that I did not appeal to her, that I need have no hope of ever making her like me; the most that I had been able to look forward to was that, thanks to her kindness, I might there and then receive, since I should not be seeing her again before I left Paris, an entirely pleasing impression, which I could take with me to Balbec indefinitely prolonged, intact, instead of a memory broken by anxiety and sorrow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Marsantes kept on interrupting her conversation with Robert to tell me how often he had spoken to her about me, how fond he was of me; she treated me with a deference which almost hurt me because I felt it to be prompted by her fear of being embroiled, on my account, with this son whom she had not seen all day, with whom she was eager to be alone, and over whom she must accordingly have supposed that the influence which she wielded was not equal to and must conciliate mine. Having heard me, earlier in the afternoon, make some reference to Bloch\u2019s uncle, M. Nissim Bernard, Mme. de Marsantes inquired whether it was he who had at one time lived at Nice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn that case, he knew M. de Marsantes there before our marriage,\u201d she told me. \u201cMy husband used often to speak of him as an excellent man, with such a delicate, generous nature.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo think that for once in his life he wasn\u2019t lying! It\u2019s incredible,\u201d would have been Bloch\u2019s comment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All this time I should have liked to explain to Mme. de Marsantes that Robert felt infinitely more affection for her than for myself, and that had she shewn any hostility towards me it was not in my nature to attempt to set him against her, to detach him from her. But now that Mme. de Guermantes had left the room, I had more leisure to observe Robert, and I noticed then for the first time that, once again, a sort of flood of anger seemed to be coursing through him, rising to the surface of his stern and sombre features. I was afraid lest, remembering the scene in the theatre that afternoon, he might be feeling humiliated in my presence at having allowed himself to be treated so harshly by his mistress without making any rejoinder\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly he broke away from his mother, who had put her arm round his neck, and, coming towards me, led me behind the little flower-strewn counter at which Mme. de Villeparisis had resumed her seat, making a sign to me to follow him into the smaller room. I was hurrying after him when M. de Charlus, who must have supposed that I was leaving the house, turned abruptly from Prince von Faffenheim, to whom he had been talking, and made a rapid circuit which brought him face to face with me. I saw with alarm that he had taken the hat in the lining of which were a capital \u2018G\u2019 and a ducal coronet. In the doorway into the little room he said, without looking at me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAs I see that you have taken to going into society, you must do me the pleasure of coming to see me. But it\u2019s a little complicated,\u201d he went on with a distracted, calculating air, as if the pleasure had been one that he was afraid of not securing again once he had let slip the opportunity of arranging with me the means by which it might be realised. \u201cI am very seldom at home; you will have to write to me. But I should prefer to explain things to you more quietly. I am just going. Will you walk a short way with me? I shall only keep you a moment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019d better take care, sir,\u201d I warned him; \u201cyou have picked up the wrong hat by mistake.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you want to stop me taking my own hat?\u201d I assumed, a similar mishap having recently occurred to myself, that someone else having taken his hat he had seized upon one at random, so as not to go home bare-headed, and that I had placed him in a difficulty by exposing his stratagem. I told him that I must say a few words to Saint-Loup. \u201cHe is still talking to that idiot the Duc de Guermantes,\u201d I added. \u201cThat really is charming; I shall tell my brother.\u201d \u201cOh! you think that would interest M. de Charlus?\u201d (I imagined that, if he had a brother, that brother must be called Charlus also. Saint-Loup had indeed explained his family tree to me at Balbec, but I had forgotten the details.) \u201cWho has been talking to you about M. de Charlus?\u201d replied the Baron in an arrogant tone. \u201cGo to Robert.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hear,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat you took part this morning in one of those orgies that he has with a woman who is disgracing him. You would do well to use your influence with him to make him realise the pain he is causing his poor mother, and all of us, by dragging our name in the dirt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should have liked to reply that at this degrading luncheon the conversation had been entirely about Emerson, Ibsen and Tolstoy, and that the young woman had lectured Robert to make him drink nothing but water. In the hope of bringing some balm to Robert, whose pride had, I felt, been wounded, I sought to find an excuse for his mistress. I did not know that at that moment, in spite of his anger with her, it was on himself that he was heaping reproaches. But it always happens, even in quarrels between a good man and a worthless woman, and when the right is all on one side, that some trifle crops up which enables the woman to appear not to have been in the wrong on one point. And as she ignores all the other points, the moment the man begins to feel the need of her company, or is demoralised by separation from her, his weakness will make his conscience more exacting, he will remember the absurd reproaches that have been flung at him and will ask himself whether they have not some foundation in fact\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion I was wrong about that matter of the necklace,\u201d Robert said to me. \u201cOf course, I never meant for a moment to do anything wrong, but, I know very well, other people don\u2019t look at things in the same way as oneself. She had a very hard time when she was young. In her eyes, I was bound to appear just the rich man who thinks he can get anything he wants with his money, and with whom a poor person cannot compete, whether in trying to influence Boucheron or in a lawsuit. Of course she has been horribly cruel to me, when I have never thought of anything but her good. But I do see clearly, she believes that I wanted to make her feel that one could keep a hold on her with money, and that\u2019s not true. And she\u2019s so fond of me; what must she be thinking of me? Poor darling, if you only knew, she has such charming ways, I simply can\u2019t tell you, she has often done the most adorable things for me. How wretched she must be feeling now! In any case, whatever happens in the long run, I don\u2019t want to let her think me a cad; I shall dash off to Boucheron\u2019s and get the necklace. You never know; very likely when she sees me with it, she will admit that she\u2019s been in the wrong. Don\u2019t you see, it\u2019s the idea that she is suffering at this moment that I can\u2019t bear. What one suffers oneself one knows; that\u2019s nothing. But with her \u2014 to say to oneself that she\u2019s suffering and not to be able to form any idea of what she feels \u2014 I think I shall go mad in a minute \u2014 I\u2019d much rather never see her again than let her suffer. She can be happy without me, if she must; that\u2019s all I ask. Listen; you know, to me everything that concerns her is enormously important, it becomes something cosmic; I shall run to the jeweller\u2019s and then go and ask her to forgive me. But until I get down there what will she be thinking of me? If she could only know that I was on my way! What about your going down there and telling her? For all we know, that might settle the whole business. Perhaps,\u201d he went on with a smile, as though he hardly ventured to believe in so idyllic a possibility, \u201cwe can all three dine together in the country. But we can\u2019t tell yet. I never know how to handle her. Poor child. I shall perhaps only hurt her more than ever. Besides, her decision may be irrevocable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert swept me back to his mother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood-bye,\u201d he said to her. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go now. I don\u2019t know when I shall get leave again. Probably not for a month. I shall write as soon as I know myself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly Robert was not in the least of the type of son who, when he goes out with his mother, feels that an attitude of exasperation towards her ought to balance the smiles and bows which he bestows on strangers. Nothing is more common than this odious form of vengeance on the part of those who appear to believe that rudeness to one\u2019s own family is the natural complement to one\u2019s ceremonial behaviour. Whatever the wretched mother may say, her son, as though he had been taken to the house against his will and wished to make her pay dearly for his presence, refutes immediately, with an ironical, precise, cruel contradiction, the timidly ventured assertion; the mother at once conforms, though without thereby disarming him, to the opinion of this superior being of whom she will continue to boast to everyone, when he is not present, as having a charming nature, and who all the same spares her none of his keenest thrusts. Saint-Loup was not at all like this; but the anguish which Rachel\u2019s absence provoked in him brought it about that, for different reasons, he was no less harsh with his mother than the sons I have been describing are with theirs. And as she listened to him I saw the same throb, like that of a mighty wing, which Mme. de Marsantes had been unable to repress when her son first entered the room, convulse her whole body once again; but this time it was an anxious face, eyes wide with grief that she fastened on him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat, Robert, you\u2019re going away? Seriously? My little son! The one day I\u2019ve seen anything of you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then quite softly, in the most natural tone, in a voice from which she strove to banish all sadness so as not to inspire her son with a pity which would perhaps have been painful to him, or else useless and might serve only to irritate him, like an argument prompted by plain common sense she added:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not at all nice of you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But to this simplicity she added so much timidity, to shew him that she was not trespassing on his freedom, so much affection, so that he should not reproach her with spoiling his pleasures, that Saint-Loup could not fail to observe in himself as it were the possibility of a similar wave of affection, that was to say an obstacle to his spending the evening with his lady. And so he grew angry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but, nice or not, that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he heaped on his mother the reproaches which no doubt he felt that he himself perhaps deserved; thus it is that egoists have always the last word; having laid down at the start that their determination is unshakeable, the more the sentiment in them to which one appeals to make them abandon it is touched, the more fault they find, not with themselves who resist the appeal but with those persons who put them under the necessity of resisting it, with the result that their own firmness may be carried to the utmost degree of cruelty, which only aggravates all the more in their eyes the culpability of the person who is so indelicate as to be hurt, to be in the right, and to cause them thus treacherously the pain of acting against their natural instinct of pity. But of her own accord Mme. de Marsantes ceased to insist, for she felt that she would not be able to keep him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI shall leave you here,\u201d he said to me, \u201cbut you\u2019re not to keep him long, Mamma, because he\u2019s got to go somewhere else in a minute.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was fully aware that my company could not afford any pleasure to Mme. de Marsantes, but I preferred, by not going with Robert, not to let her suppose that I was involved in these pleasures which deprived her of him. I should have liked to find some excuse for her son\u2019s conduct, less from affection for him than from pity tor her. But it was she who spoke first\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPoor boy,\u201d she began, \u201cI am sure I must have hurt him dreadfully. You see, Sir, mothers are such selfish creatures, after all he hasn\u2019t many pleasures, he comes so little to Paris. Oh, dear, if he hadn\u2019t gone already I should have liked to stop him, not to keep him of course, but just to tell him that I\u2019m not vexed with him, that I think he was quite right. Will you excuse me if I go and look over the staircase?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I accompanied her there\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert! Robert!\u201d she called. \u201cNo; he\u2019s gone; we are too late.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment I would as gladly have undertaken a mission to make Robert break with his mistress as, a few hours earlier, to make him go and live with her altogether. In one case Saint-Loup would have regarded me as a false friend, in the other his family would have called me his evil genius. Yet I was the same man, at an interval of a few hours\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We returned to the drawing-room. Seeing that Saint-Loup was not with us, Mme. de Villeparisis exchanged with M. de Norpois that dubious, derisive and not too pitying glance with which people point out to one another an over-jealous wife or an over-loving mother (spectacles which to outsiders are amusing), as much as to say: \u201cThere now, there\u2019s been trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert went to his mistress, taking with him the splendid ornament which, after what had been said on both sides, he ought not to have given her. But it came to the same thing, for she would not look at it, and even after their reconciliation he could never persuade her to accept it. Certain of Robert\u2019s friends thought that these proofs of disinterestedness which she furnished were deliberately planned to draw him closer to her. And yet she was not greedy about money, except perhaps to be able to spend it without thought. I have seen her bestow recklessly on people whom she believed to be in need the most insensate charity. \u201cAt this moment,\u201d Robert\u2019s friends would say to him, seeking to balance by their malicious words a disinterested action on Rachel\u2019s part, \u201cat this moment she will be in the promenade at the Folies-Berg\u00e8res. She\u2019s an enigma, that girl is, a regular sphinx.\u201d After all, how many women who are not disinterested, since they are kept by men, have we not seen, with a delicacy that flowers from their sordid existence, set with their own hands a thousand little limits to the generosity of their lovers?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert knew of scarcely any of the infidelities of his mistress, and tortured his mind over what were mere nothings compared with the real life of Rachel, a life which began every day only after he had left her. He knew of scarcely any of these infidelities. One could have told him of them without shaking his confidence in Rachel. For it is a charming law of nature which manifests itself in the heart of the most complex social organisms, that we live in perfect ignorance of those we love. On one side of the mirror the lover says to himself: \u201cShe is an angel, she will never yield herself to me, I may as well die \u2014 and yet she does care for me; she cares so much that perhaps \u2014 but no, it can never possibly happen.\u201d And in the exaltation of his desire, in the anguish of waiting, what jewels he flings at the feet of this woman, how he runs to borrow money to save her from inconvenience; meanwhile, on the other side of the screen, through which their conversation will no more carry than that which visitors exchange outside the glass wall of an aquarium, the public are saying: \u201cYou don\u2019t know her? I congratulate you, she has robbed, in fact ruined I don\u2019t know how many men. There isn\u2019t a worse girl in Paris. She\u2019s a common swindler. And cunning isn\u2019t the word!\u201d And perhaps the public are not entirely wrong in their use of the last epithet, for indeed the sceptical man who is not really in love with the woman and whom she merely attracts says to his friends: \u201cNo, no, my dear fellow, she is not in the least a prostitute; I don\u2019t say she hasn\u2019t had an adventure or two in her time, but she\u2019s not a woman one pays, she\u2019d be a damned sight too expensive if she was. With her it\u2019s fifty thousand francs or nothing.\u201d Well, he has spent fifty thousand francs on her, he has had her once, but she (finding, moreover, a willing accomplice in the man himself) has managed to persuade him that he is one of those who have had her for nothing. Such is society, in which every one of us has two aspects, in which the most obvious, the most notorious faults will never be known by a certain other person save embedded in, under the protection of a shell, a smooth cocoon, a delicious curiosity of nature. There were in Paris two thoroughly respectable men to whom Saint-Loup no longer bowed, and could not refer without a tremor in his voice, calling them exploiters of women: this was because they had both been ruined by Rachel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI blame myself for one thing only,\u201d Mme. de Marsantes murmured in my ear, \u201cand that was my telling him that he wasn\u2019t nice to me. He, such an adorable, unique son, there\u2019s no one else like him in the world, the only time I see him, to have told him he wasn\u2019t nice to me, I would far rather he\u2019d beaten me, because I am sure that whatever pleasure he may be having this evening, and he hasn\u2019t many, will be spoiled for him by that unfair word. But, Sir, I mustn\u2019t keep you, since you\u2019re in a hurry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anxiously, Mme. de Marsantes bade me good-bye. These sentiments bore upon Robert; she was sincere. But she ceased to be, to become a great lady once more\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have been so interested, so glad to have this little talk with you. Thank you! Thank you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And with a humble air she fastened on me a look of gratitude, of exhilaration, as though my conversation were one of the keenest pleasures that she had experienced in her life. These charming glances went very well with the black flowers on her white skirt; they were those of a great lady who knew her business\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I am in no hurry,\u201d I replied; \u201cbesides, I must wait for M. de Charlus; I am going with him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis overheard these last words. They appeared to vex her. Had the matter in question not been one which could not possibly give rise to such a sentiment, it might have struck me that what seemed to be at that moment alarmed in Mme. de Villeparisis was her modesty. But this hypothesis never even entered my mind. I was delighted with Mme. de Guermantes, with Saint-Loup, with Mme. de Marsantes, with M. de Charlus, with Mme. de Villeparisis; I did not stop to reflect, and I spoke light-heartedly and at random\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re going from here with my nephew Palam\u00e8de?\u201d she asked me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thinking that it might produce a highly favourable impression on Mme. de Villeparisis if she learned that I was on intimate terms with a nephew whom she esteemed so greatly, \u201cHe has asked me to go home with him,\u201d I answered blithely. \u201cI am so glad. Besides, we are greater friends than you think, and I\u2019ve quite made up my mind that we\u2019re going to be better friends still.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From being vexed, Mme. de Villeparisis seemed to have grown anxious. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for him,\u201d she said to me, with a preoccupied air. \u201cHe is talking to M. de Faffenheim. He\u2019s certain to have forgotten what he said to you. You\u2019d much better go, now, quickly, while his back is turned.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first emotion shewn by Mme. de Villeparisis would have suggested, but for the circumstances, offended modesty. Her insistence, her opposition might well, if one had studied her face alone, have appeared to be dictated by virtue. I was not, myself, in any hurry to join Robert and his mistress. But Mme. de Villeparisis seemed to make such a point of my going that, thinking perhaps that she had some important business to discuss with her nephew, I bade her good-bye. Next to her M. de Guermantes, superb and Olympian, was ponderously seated. One would have said that the notion omnipresent in all his members, of his vast riches gave him a particular high density, as though they had been melted in a crucible into a single human ingot to form this man whose value was so immense. At the moment of my saying good-bye to him he rose politely from his seat, and I could feel the dead weight of thirty millions which his old-fashioned French breeding set in motion, raised, until it stood before me. I seemed to be looking at that statue of Olympian Zeus which Phidias is said to have cast in solid gold. Such was the power that good breeding had over M. de Guermantes over the body of M. de Guermantes at least, for it had not an equal mastery over the ducal mind. M. de Guermantes laughed at his own jokes, but did not unbend to other people\u2019s\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I went downstairs I heard behind me a voice calling out to me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo this is how you wait for me, is it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if we go a little way on foot?\u201d he asked dryly, when we were in the courtyard. \u201cWe can walk until I find a cab that suits me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou wished to speak to me about something, Sir?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh yes, as a matter of fact there were some things I wished to say to you, but I am not so sure now whether I shall. As far as you are concerned, I am sure that they might be the starting-point which would lead you to inestimable benefits. But I can see also that they would bring into my existence, at an age when one begins to value tranquillity, a great loss of time, great inconvenience. I ask myself whether you are worth all the pains that I should have to take with you, and I have not the pleasure of knowing you well enough to be able to say. Perhaps also to you yourself what I could do for you does not appear sufficiently attractive for me to give, myself so much trouble, for I repeat quite frankly that for me it can only be trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I protested that, in that case, he must not dream of it. This summary end to the discussion did not seem to be to his liking\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat sort of politeness means nothing,\u201d he rebuked me coldly. \u201cThere is nothing so pleasant as to give oneself trouble for a person who is worth one\u2019s while. For the best of us, the study of the arts, a taste for old things, collections, gardens are all mere ersatz, succedanea, alibis. In the heart of our tub, like Diogenes, we cry out for a man. We cultivate begonias, we trim yews, as a last resort, because yews and begonias submit to treatment. But we should like to give our time to a plant of human growth, if we were sure that he was worth the trouble. That is the whole question: you must know something about yourself. Are you worth my trouble or not?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI would not for anything in the world, Sir, be a cause of anxiety to you,\u201d I said to him, \u201cbut so far as I am concerned you may be sure that everything which comes to me from you will be a very great pleasure to me. I am deeply touched that you should be so kind as to take notice of me in this way and try to help me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Greatly to my surprise, it was almost with effusion that he thanked me for this speech, slipping his arm through mine with that intermittent familiarity which had already struck me at Balbec, and was in such contrast to the coldness of his tone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith the want of consideration common at your age,\u201d he told me, \u201cyou are liable to say things at times which would open an unbridgeable gulf between us. What you have said just now, on the other hand, is exactly the sort of thing that touches me, and makes me want to do a great deal for you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As he walked arm in arm with me and uttered these words, which, albeit tinged with contempt, were so affectionate, M. de Charlus now fastened his gaze on me with that intense fixity which had struck me the first morning, when I saw him outside the casino at Balbec, and indeed many years before that, through the pink hawthorns, standing beside Mme. Swann, whom I supposed then to be his mistress, in the park at Tansonville; now let it stray around him and examine the cabs which at this time of the day were passing in considerable numbers on the way to their stables, looking so determinedly at them that several stopped, the drivers supposing that he wished to engage them. But M. de Charlus immediately dismissed them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re not what I want,\u201d he explained to me, \u201cit\u2019s all a question of the colour of their lamps, and the direction they\u2019re going in. I hope, Sir,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat you will not in any way misinterpret the purely disinterested and charitable nature of the proposal which I am going to make to you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was struck by the similarity of his diction to Swann\u2019s, closer now than at Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou have enough intelligence, I suppose, not to imagine that it is from want of society, from any fear of solitude and boredom that I have recourse to you. I do not, as a rule, care to talk about myself, but you may possibly have heard \u2014 it was alluded to in a leading article in The Times, which made a considerable impression \u2014 that the Emperor of Austria, who has always honoured me with his friendship, and is good enough to insist on keeping up terms of cousinship with me, declared the other day in an interview which was made public that if the Comte de Chambord had had by his side a man as thoroughly conversant with the undercurrents of European politics as myself he would be King of France to-day. I have often thought, Sir, that there was in me, thanks not to my own humble talents but to circumstances which you may one day have occasion to learn, a sort of secret record of incalculable value, of which I have not felt myself at liberty to make use, personally, but which would be a priceless acquisition to a young man to whom I would hand over in a few months what it has taken me more than thirty years to collect, what I am perhaps alone in possessing. I do not speak of the intellectual enjoyment which you would find in learning certain secrets which a Michelet of our day would give years of his life to know, and in the light of which certain events would assume for him an entirely different aspect. And I do not speak only of events that have already occurred, but of the chain of circumstances.\u201d (This was a favourite expression with M. de Charlus, and often, when he used it, he joined his hands as if in prayer, but with his fingers stiffened, as though to illustrate by their complexity the said circumstances, which he did not specify, and the chain that linked them.) \u201cI could give you an explanation that no one has dreamed of, not only of the past but of the future.\u201d M. de Charlus broke off to question me about Bloch, whom he had heard discussed, though without appearing to be listening, in his aunt\u2019s drawing-room. And with that ironical accent he so skilfully detached what he was saying that he seemed to be thinking of something else altogether and to be speaking mechanically, simply out of politeness. He asked if my friend was young, good looking and so forth. Bloch, if he had heard him would have been more puzzled even than with M. de Norpois, but for very different reasons, to know whether M. de Charlus was for or against Drey, fus. \u201cIt is not a bad idea, if you wish to learn about life,\u201d went on M. de Charlus when he had finished questioning me, \u201cto include among your friends an occasional foreigner.\u201d I replied that Bloch was French. \u201cIndeed,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cI took him to be a Jew.\u201d His assertion of this incompatibility made me suppose that M. de Charlus was more anti-Dreyfusard than anyone I had met. He protested, however, against the charge of treason levelled against Dreyfus. But his protest took this form: \u201cI understand the newspapers to say that Dreyfus has committed a crime against his country \u2014 so I understand, I pay no attention to the newspapers, I read them as I wash my hands, without finding that it is worth my while to take any interest in what I am doing. In any case, the crime is non-existent, your friend\u2019s compatriot would have committed a crime if he had betrayed Judaea, but what has he to do with France?\u201d I pointed out that if there should be a war the Jews would be mobilised just as much as anyone else. \u201cPerhaps so, and I am not sure that it would not be an imprudence. If we bring over Senegalese and Malagasies, I hardly suppose that their hearts will be in the task of defending France, which is only natural. Your Dreyfus might rather be convicted of a breach of the laws of hospitality. But we need not discuss that. Perhaps you could ask your friend to allow me to be present at some great festival in the Temple, at a circumcision, with Jewish chants. He might perhaps take a hall, and give me some biblical entertainment, as the young ladies of Saint-Cyr performed scenes taken from the Psalms by Racine, to amuse Louis XIV. You might even arrange parties to give us a good laugh. For instance a battle between your friend and his father, in which he would smite him as David smote Goliath. That would make quite an amusing farce. He might even, while he was about it, deal some stout blows at his hag (or, as my old nurse would say, his \u2018haggart\u2019) of a mother. That would be an excellent show, and would not be unpleasing to us, eh, my young friend, since we like exotic spectacles, and to thrash that non-European creature would be giving a well-earned punishment to an old camel.\u201d As he poured out this terrible, almost insane language, M. de Charlus squeezed my arm until it ached. I reminded myself of all that his family had told me of his wonderful kindness to this old nurse, whose Moli\u00e8resque vocabulary he had just quoted, and thought to myself that the connexions, hitherto, I felt, little studied, between goodness and wickedness in the same heart, various as they might be, would be an interesting subject for research\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I warned him that, anyhow, Mme. Bloch no longer existed, while as for M. Bloch, I questioned to what extent he would enjoy a sport which might easily result in his being blinded. M. de Charlus seemed annoyed. \u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cis a woman who made a great mistake in dying. As for blinding him, surely the Synagogue is blind, it does not perceive the truth of the Gospel. In any case, think, at this moment, when all these unhappy Jews are trembling before the stupid fury of the Christians, what an honour it would be for him to see a man like myself condescend to be amused by their sports.\u201d At this point I caught sight of M. Bloch senior, who was coming towards us, probably on his way to meet his son. He did not see us but I offered to introduce him to M. de Charlus. I had no conception of the torrent of rage which my words were to let loose. \u201cIntroduce him to me! But you must have singularly little idea of social values! People do not get to know me as easily as that. In the present instance, the awkwardness would be twofold, on account of the youth of the introducer and the unworthiness of the person introduced. At the most, if I am ever permitted to enjoy the Asiatic spectacle which I suggested to you, I might address to the horrible creature a few words indicative of generous feeling. But on condition that he allows himself to be thoroughly thrashed by his son, I might go so far as to express my satisfaction.\u201d As it happened, M. Bloch paid no attention to us. He was occupied in greeting Mme. Sazerat with a series of sweeping bows, which were very favourably received. I was surprised at this, for in the old days at Combray she had been indignant at my parents for having young Bloch in the house, so anti-semitic was she then. But Dreyfusism, like a strong gust of wind, had, a few days before this, wafted M. Bloch to her feet. My father\u2019s friend had found Mme. Sazerat charming and was particularly gratified by the anti-semitism of the lady, which he regarded as a proof of the sincerity of her faith and the soundness of her Dreyfusard opinions, and also as enhancing the value of the call which she had authorised him to pay her. He had not even been offended when she had said to him stolidly: \u201cM. Drumont has the impudence to put the Revisionists in the same bag as the Protestants and the Jews. A delightful promiscuity!\u201d \u201cBernard,\u201d he had said with pride, on reaching home, to M. Nissim Bernard, \u201cyou know, she has that prejudice!\u201d But M. Nissim Bernard had said nothing, only raising his eyes to heaven in an angelic gaze. Saddened by the misfortunes of the Jews, remembering his old friendships with Christians, grown mannered and precious with increasing years, for reasons which the reader will learn in due course, he had now the air of a pre-Raphaelite ghost on to which hair had been incongruously grafted, like threads in the heart of an opal. \u201cAll this Dreyfus business,\u201d went on the Baron, still clasping me by the arm, \u201chas only one drawback. It destroys society (I do not say polite society; society has long ceased to deserve that laudatory epithet) by the influx of Mr. and Mrs. Camels and Camelfies and Camelyards, astonishing creatures whom I find even in the houses of my own cousins, because they belong to the Patrie Fran\u00e7aise, or the Anti-Jewish, or some such league, as if a political opinion entitled one to any social qualification.\u201d This frivolity in M. de Charlus brought out his family likeness to the Duchesse de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I remarked to him on the resemblance. As he appeared to think that I did not know her, I reminded him of the evening at the Opera when he had seemed to be trying to avoid me. He assured me with such insistence that he had never even seen me there that I should have begun to believe him, if presently a trifling incident had not led me to think that M. de Charlus, in his excessive pride perhaps, did not care to be seen with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLet us return to yourself,\u201d he said, \u201cand my plans for you. There exists among certain men, Sir, a freemasonry of which I cannot now say more than that it numbers in its ranks four of the reigning sovereigns of Europe Now, the courtiers of one of these are trying to cure him of his fancy. That is a very serious matter, and may bring us to war. Yes, Sir, that is a fact You remember the story of the man who believed that he had the Princess of China shut up in a bottle. It was a form of insanity. He was cured of it, But as soon as he ceased to be mad he became merely stupid. There are maladies which we must not seek to cure because they alone protect us from others that are more serious. A cousin of mine had trouble with his stomach; he could not digest anything. The most learned specialists on the stomach treated him, with no effect. I took him to a certain doctor (another highly interesting man, by the way, of whom I could tell you a great deal). He guessed at once that the trouble was nervousness; he persuaded his patient, ordered him to eat whatever he liked quite boldly and assured him that his digestion would stand it. But my cousin had nephritis also. What the stomach can digest perfectly well the kidneys cease, after a time, to eliminate, and my cousin, instead of living to a good old age with an imaginary disease of the stomach which obliged him to keep to a diet, died at forty with his stomach cured but his kidneys ruined. Given a very considerable advantage over people of your age, for all one knows, you will perhaps become what some eminent man of the past might have been if a good angel had revealed to him, in the midst of a humanity that knew nothing of them, the secrets of steam and electricity. Do not be foolish, do not refuse from discretion. Understand that, if I do you a great service, I expect my reward from you to be no less great. It is many years now since people in society ceased to interest me. I have but one passion left, to seek to redeem the mistakes of my life by conferring the benefit of my knowledge on a soul that is still virgin and capable of being inflamed by virtue. I have had great sorrows, Sir, of which I may tell you perhaps some day; I have lost my wife, who was the loveliest, the noblest, the most perfect creature that one could dream of seeing. I have young relatives who are not \u2014 I do not say worthy, but who are not capable of accepting the moral heritage of which I have been speaking. For all I know, you may be he into whose hands it is to pass, he whose life I shall be able to direct and to raise to so lofty a plane. My own would gain in return. Perhaps in teaching you the great secrets of diplomacy I might recover a taste for them myself, and begin at last to do things of real interest in which you would have an equal share. But before I can tell I must see you often, very often, every day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was thinking of taking advantage of this unexpected kindness on M. de Charlus\u2019s part to ask him whether he could not arrange for me to meet his sister-in-law when, suddenly, I felt my arm violently jerked, as though by an electric shock. It was M. de Charlus who had hurriedly withdrawn his arm from mine. Although as he talked he had allowed his eyes to wander in all directions he had only just caught sight of M. d\u2019Argencourt, who was coming towards us from a side street. On seeing us, M. d\u2019Argencourt appeared worried, cast at me a look of distrust, almost that look intended for a creature of another race than one\u2019s own with which Mme. de Guermantes had quizzed Bloch, and tried to avoid us. But one would have said that M. de Charlus was determined to shew him that he was not at all anxious not to be seen by him, for he called to him, simply to tell him something that was of no importance. And fearing perhaps that M. d\u2019Argencourt had not recognised me, M. de Charlus informed him that I was a great friend of Mme. de Villeparisis, of the Duchesse de Guermantes, of Robert de Saint-Loup, and that he himself, Charlus, was an old friend of my grandmother, and glad to be able to shew her grandson a little of the affection that he felt for her. Nevertheless I observed that M. d\u2019Argencourt, albeit I had barely been introduced to him at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, and M. de Charlus had now spoken to him at great length about my family, was distinctly colder to me than he had been in the afternoon; and for a long time he shewed the same aloofness whenever we met. He watched me now with a curiosity in which there was no sign of friendliness, and seemed even to have to overcome an instinctive repulsion when, on leaving us, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, he held out a hand to me which he at once withdrew\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am sorry about that,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cThat fellow Argencourt, well born but ill bred, more than feeble as a diplomat, an impossible husband, always running after women like a person in a play, is one of those men who are incapable of understanding but perfectly capable of destroying the things in life that are really great. I hope that our friendship will be one of them, if it is ever to be formed, and I hope also that you will honour me by keeping it \u2014 as I shall \u2014 well clear of the heels of any of those donkeys who, from idleness or clumsiness or deliberate wickedness trample upon what would seem to have been made to endure. Unfortunately, that is the mould in which most of the men one meets have been cast.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Duchesse de Guermantes seems to be very clever. We were talking this afternoon about the possibility of war. It appears that she is specially well informed on that subject.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe is nothing of the sort,\u201d replied M. de Charlus tartly. \u201cWomen, and most men, for that matter, understand nothing of what I was going to tell you. My sister-in-law is a charming woman who imagines that we are still living in the days of Balzac\u2019s novels, when women had an influence on Politics. Going to her house could at present have only a bad effect on you, as for that matter going anywhere. That was one of the very things I was just going to tell you when that fool interrupted me. The first sacrifice that you must make for me \u2014 I shall claim them from you in proportion to the gifts I bestow on you \u2014 is to give up going into society. It distressed me this afternoon to see you at that idiotic tea-party. You may remind me that I Was there myself, but for me it was not a social gathering, it was simply a family visit. Later on, when you have established your position, if it amuses you to step down for a little into that sort of thing, it may perhaps, do no harm. And then, I need not point out how invaluable I can be to you. The \u2018Open Sesame\u2019 to the Guermantes house and any others that it is worth while throwing open the doors of to you, rests with me I shall be the judge, and intend to remain master of the situation.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I thought I would take advantage of what M. de Charlus had said about my call on Mme. de Villeparisis to try to find out what position exactly she occupied in society, but the question took another form on my lips than I had intended, and I asked him instead what the Villeparisis family was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat is absolutely as though you had asked me what the Nobody family was,\u201d replied M. de Charlus. \u201cMy aunt married, for love, a M Thirion, who was extremely rich, for that matter, and whose sisters had married surprisingly well; and from that day onwards he called himself Marquis de Villeparisis. It did no harm to anyone, at the most a little to himself, and very little! What his reason was I cannot tell; I suppose he was actually a \u2018Monsieur de Villeparisis,\u2019 a gentleman born at Villeparisis, which as you know is the name of a little place outside Paris. My aunt tried to make out that there was such a Marquisate in the family, she wanted to put things on a proper footing; I can\u2019t tell you why. When one takes a name to which one has no right it is better not to copy the regular forms.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis being merely Mme. Thirion completed the fall which had begun in my estimation of her when I had seen the composite nature of her party. I felt it to be unfair that a woman whose title and name were of quite recent origin should be able thus to impose upon her contemporaries, with the prospect of similarly imposing upon posterity, by virtue of her friendships with royal personages. Now that she had become once again what I had supposed her to be in my childhood, a person who had nothing aristocratic about her, these distinguished kinsfolk who gathered round her seemed to remain alien to her. She did not cease to be charming to us all. I went occasionally to see her and she sent me little presents from time to time. But I had never any impression that she belonged to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and if I had wanted any information about it she would have been one of the last people to whom I should have applied\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt present,\u201d went on M. de Charlus, \u201cby going into society, you will only damage your position, warp your intellect and character. Also, you must be particularly careful in choosing your friends. Keep mistresses, if your family have no objection, that doesn\u2019t concern me, indeed I can only advise it, you young rascal, young rascal who will soon have to start shaving,\u201d he rallied me, passing his fingers over my chin. \u201cBut the choice of your men friends is more important. Eight out of ten young men are little scoundrels, little wretches capable of doing you an injury which you will never be able to repair. Wait, now, my nephew Saint-Loup is quite a suitable companion for you, at a pinch. As far as your future is concerned, he can be of no possible use to you, but for that I am sufficient. And really when all\u2019s said and done, as a person to go about with, at times when you have had enough of me, he does not seem to present any serious drawback that I know of. At any rate he is a man, not one of those effeminate creatures one sees so many of nowadays, who look like little renters, and at any moment may bring their innocent victims to the gallows.\u201d I did not know the meaning of this slang word \u2018renter\u2019; anyone who had known it would have been as greatly surprised by his use of it as myself. People in society always like talking slang, and people against whom certain things may be hinted like to shew that they are not afraid to mention them. A proof of innocence in their eyes. But they have lost their sense of proportion, they are no longer capable of realising the point at which a certain pleasantry will become too technical, too shocking, will be a proof rather of corruption than of simplicity. \u201cHe is not like the rest of them; he has nice manners; he is really serious.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could not help smiling at this epithet \u2018serious,\u2019 to which the intonation that M. de Charlus gave to it seemed to impart the sense of \u2018virtuous,\u2019 of \u2018steady,\u2019 as one says of a little shop-girl that she is \u2018serious.\u2019 At this moment a cab passed, zigzagging along the street; a young cabman, who had deserted his box, was driving it from inside, where he lay sprawling upon the cushions, apparently half drunk. M. de Charlus instantly stopped him. The driver began to argue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhich way are you going?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYours.\u201d This surprised me, for M. de Charlus had already refused several cabs with similarly coloured lamps\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to get up on the box. D\u2019you mind if I stay down here?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; but you must put down the hood. Well, think over my proposal,\u201d said M. de Charlus, preparing to leave me, \u201cI give you a few days to consider my offer; write to me. I repeat, I shall need to see you every day, and to receive from you guarantees of loyalty, of discretion which, for that matter, you do appear, I must say, to furnish. But in the course of my life I have been so often taken in by appearances that I never wish to trust them again. Damn it, it\u2019s the least you can expect that before giving up a treasure I should know into what hands it is going to pass. Very well, bear in mind what I\u2019m offering you; you are like Hercules\u2019 (though, unfortunately for yourself, you do not appear to me to have quite his muscular development) at the parting of the ways. Try not to have to regret all your life not having chosen the way that leads to virtue. Hallo!\u201d he turned to the cabman, \u201chaven\u2019t you put the hood down? I\u2019ll do it myself. I think, too, I\u2019d better drive, seeing the state you appear to be in.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He jumped in beside the cabman, took the reins, and the horse trotted off\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for myself, no sooner had I turned in at our gate than I found the pendant to the conversation which I had heard exchanged that afternoon between Bloch and M. de Norpois, but in another form, brief, inverted and cruel. This was a dispute between our butler, who believed in Dreyfus, and the Guermantes\u2019, who was an anti-Dreyfusard. The truths and counter-truths which came in conflict above ground, among the intellectuals of the rival Leagues, the Patrie Fran\u00e7aise and the Droits de l\u2019Homme, were fast spreading downwards into the subsoil of popular opinion. M. Reinach was manipulating, by appeals to sentiment, people whom he had never seen, while for himself the Dreyfus case simply presented itself to his reason as an incontrovertible theory which he proved in the sequel by the most astonishing victory for rational policy (a victory against France, according to some) that the world has ever seen. In two years he replaced a Billot by a Clemenceau Ministry, revolutionised public opinion from top to bottom, took Picquart from his prison to install him, ungrateful, in the Ministry of War. Perhaps this rationalist manipulator of crowds was himself the puppet of his ancestry. When we find that the systems of philosophy which contain the most truths were dictated to their authors, in the last analysis, by reasons of sentiment, how are we to suppose that in a simple affair of politics like the Dreyfus case reasons of this order may not, unknown to the reasoner, have controlled his reason. Bloch believed himself to have been led by a logical sequence to choose Dreyfusism, yet he knew that his nose, skin and hair had been imposed on him by his race. Doubtless the reason enjoys more freedom; yet it obeys certain laws which it has not prescribed for itself. The case of the Guermantes\u2019 butler and our own was peculiar. The waves of the two currents of Dreyfusism and anti-Dreyfusism which now divided France from end to end were, on the whole, silent, but the occasional echoes which they emitted were sincere. When you heard anyone in the middle of a conversation which was being deliberately kept off the Case announce furtively some piece of political news, generally false, but always with a hopefulness of its truth, you could induce from the nature of his predictions where his heart lay. Thus there came into conflict on certain points, on one side a timid apostolate, on the other a righteous indignation. The two butlers whom I heard arguing as I came in furnished an exception to the rule. Ours let it be understood that Dreyfus was guilty, the Guermantes\u2019 butler that he was innocent. This was done not to conceal their personal convictions, but from cunning, and in the keenness of their rivalry. Our butler, being uncertain whether the fresh trial would be ordered, wished beforehand, in the event of failure, to deprive the Duke\u2019s butler of the joy of seeing a just cause vanquished. The Duke\u2019s butler thought that, in the event of a refusal, ours would be more indignant at the detention on the Devil\u2019s Isle of an innocent man. The porter looked on. I had the impression that it was not he who was the cause of dissension in the Guermantes household\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went upstairs, and found my grandmother not so well. For some time past, without knowing exactly what was wrong, she had been complaining of her health. It is in moments of illness that we are compelled to recognise that we live not alone but chained to a creature of a different kingdom, whole worlds apart, who has no knowledge of us and by whom it is impossible to make ourselves understood: our body. Say that we met a brigand by the way; we might yet convince him by an appeal to his personal interest, if not to our own plight. But to ask pity of our body is like discoursing before an octopus, for which our words can have no more meaning than the sound of the tides, and with which we should be appalled to find ourselves condemned to live. My grandmother\u2019s attacks passed, often enough-unnoticed by the attention which she kept always diverted to ourselves. When the pain was severe, in the hope of curing it, she would try in vain to understand what the trouble was. If the morbid phenomena of which her body was the theatre remained obscure and beyond the reach of her mind, they were clear and intelligible to certain creatures belonging to the same natural kingdom as themselves, creatures to which the human mind has learned gradually to have recourse in order to understand what the body is saying to it, as when a foreigner accosts us we try to find some one belonging to his country who will act as interpreter. These can talk to our body, and tell us if its anger is serious or will soon be appeased. Cottard, whom we had called in to see my grandmother, and who had infuriated us by asking with a dry smile, the moment we told him that she was ill: \u201cIll? You\u2019re sure it\u2019s not what they call a diplomatic illness?\u201d He tried to soothe his patient\u2019s restlessness by a milk diet. But incessant bowls of milk soup gave her no relief, because my grandmother sprinkled them liberally with salt (the toxic effects of which were as yet, Widal not having made his discoveries, unknown). For, medicine being a compendium of the successive and contradictory mistakes of medical practioners, when we summon the wisest of them to our aid, the chances are that we may be relying on a scientific truth the error of which will be recognised in a few years\u2019 time. So that to believe in medicine would be the height of folly, if not to believe in it were not greater folly still, for from this mass of errors there have emerged in the course of time many truths. Cottard had told us to take her temperature. A thermometer was fetched. Throughout almost all its length it was clear of mercury. Scarcely could one make out, crouching at the foot of the tube, in its little cell, the silver salamander. It seemed dead. The glass reed was slipped into my grandmother\u2019s mouth. We had no need to leave it there for long; the little sorceress had not been slow in casting her horoscope. We found her motionless, perched half-way up her tower, and declining to move, shewing us with precision the figure that we had asked of her, a figure with which all the most careful examination that my grandmother\u2019s mind could have devoted to herself would have been incapable of furnishing her: 101 degrees. For the first time we felt some anxiety. We shook the thermometer well, to erase the ominous line, as though we were able thus to reduce the patient\u2019s fever simultaneously with the figure shewn on the scale. Alas, it was only too clear that the little sibyl, unreasoning as she was, had not pronounced judgment arbitrarily, for the next day, scarcely had the thermometer been inserted between my grandmother\u2019s lips when almost at once, as though with a single bound, exulting in her certainty and in her intuition of a fact that to us was imperceptible, the little prophetess had come to a halt at the same point, in an implacable immobility, and pointed once again to that figure 101 with the tip of her gleaming wand. Nothing more did she tell us; in vain might we long, seek, pray, she was deaf to our entreaties; it seemed as though this were her final utterance, a warning and a menace. Then, in an attempt to constrain her to modify her response, we had recourse to another creature of the same kingdom, but more potent, which is not content with questioning the body but can command it, a febrifuge of the same order as the modern aspirin, which had not then come into use. We had not shaken the thermometer down below 99.5, and hoped that it would not have to rise from there. We made my grandmother swallow this drug and then replaced the thermometer in her mouth. Like an implacable warder to whom one presents a permit signed by a higher authority whose protecting influence one has sought and who, finding it to be in order, replies: \u201cVery well; I have nothing to say; if it\u2019s like that you may pass,\u201d this time the watcher in the tower dirt not move. But sullenly she seemed to be saying: \u201cWhat use will that be to you? Since you are friends with quinine, she may give me the order not to go up, once, ten times, twenty times. And then she will grow tired of telling me, I know her; get along with you. This won\u2019t last for ever. And then you\u2019ll be a lot better off.\u201d Thereupon my grandmother felt the presence within her of a creature which knew the human body better than herself, the presence of a contemporary of the races that have vanished from the earth, the presence of earth\u2019s first inhabitant \u2014 long anterior to the creation of thinking man \u2014 she felt that aeonial ally who was sounding her, a little roughly even, in the head, the heart, the elbow; he found out the weak places, organised everything for the prehistoric combat which began at once to be fought. In a moment a trampled Python, the fever, was vanquished by the potent chemical substance to which my grandmother, across the series of kingdoms, reaching out beyond all animal and vegetable life, would fain have been able to give thanks. And she remained moved by this glimpse which she had caught, through the mists of so many centuries, of a climate anterior to the creation even of plants. Meanwhile the thermometer, like a Weird Sister momentarily vanquished by some more ancient god, held motionless her silver spindle. Alas! other inferior creatures which man has trained to the chase of the mysterious quarry which he cannot pursue within the pathless forest of himself, reported cruelly to us every day a certain quantity of albumen, not large, but constant enough for it also to appear to bear relation to some persistent malady which we could not detect. Bergotte had shocked that scrupulous instinct in me which made me subordinate my intellect when he spoke to me of Dr. du Boulbon as of a physician who would not bore me, who would discover methods of treatment which, however strange they might appear, would adapt themselves to the singularity of my mind. But ideas transform themselves in us, they overcome the resistance with which we at first meet them, and feed upon rich intellectual reserves which we did not know to have been prepared for them. So, as happens whenever anything we have heard said about some one whom we do not know has had the faculty of awakening in us the idea of great talent, of a sort of genius, in my inmost mind I gave Dr. du Boulbon the benefit of that unlimited confidence which he inspires in us who with an eye more penetrating than other men\u2019s perceives the truth. I knew indeed that he was more of a specialist in nervous diseases, the man to whom Charcot before his death had predicted that he would reign supreme in neurology and psychiatry. \u201cAh! I don\u2019t know about that. It\u2019s quite possible,\u201d put in Fran\u00e7oise, who was in the room and heard Charcot\u2019s name, as she heard du Boulbon\u2019s, for the first time But this in no way prevented her from saying \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Her \u2018possibles,\u2019 her \u2018perhapses,\u2019 her \u2018I don\u2019t knows\u2019 were peculiarly irritating at such a moment. One wanted to say to her: \u201cNaturally you don\u2019t know, since you haven\u2019t the faintest idea of what we are talking about, how can you even say whether it\u2019s possible or not; you know nothing about it. Anyhow, you can\u2019t say now that you don\u2019t know what Charcot said to du Boulbon. You do know because we have just told you, and your \u2018perhapses\u2019 and \u2018possibles\u2019 don\u2019t come in, because it\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In spite of this more special competence in cerebral and nervous matters, as I knew that du Boulbon was a great physician, a superior man, of a profound and inventive intellect, I begged my mother to send for him, and the hope that, by a clear perception of the malady, he might perhaps cure it, carried the day finally over the fear that we had of (if we called in a specialist) alarming my grandmother. What decided my mother was the fact that, encouraged unconsciously by Cottard, my grandmother no longer went out of doors, and scarcely rose from her bed. In vain might she answer us in the words of Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9\u2018s letter on Mme. de la Fayette: \u201cEveryone said she was mad not to wish to go out. I said to these persons, so headstrong in their judgment: \u2018Mme. de la Fayette is not mad!\u2019 and I stuck to that. It has taken her death to prove that she was quite right not to go out.\u201d Du Boulbon when he came decided against \u2014 if not Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, whom we did not quote to him \u2014 my grandmother, at any rate. Instead of sounding her chest, fixing on her steadily his wonderful eyes, in which there was perhaps the illusion that he was making a profound scrutiny of his patient, or the desire to give her that illusion, which seemed spontaneous but must be mechanically produced, or else not to let her see that he was thinking of something quite different, or simply to obtain the mastery over her, he began talking about Bergotte\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should think so, indeed, he\u2019s magnificent, you are quite right to admire him. But which of his books do you prefer? Indeed! Well, perhaps that is the best after all. In any case it is the best composed of his novels. Claire is quite charming in it; of his male characters which appeals to you most?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I supposed at first that he was making her talk like this about literature because he himself found medicine boring, perhaps also to display his breadth of mind and even, with a more therapeutic aim, to restore confidence to his patient, to shew her that he was not alarmed, to take her mind from the state of her health. But afterwards I realised that, being distinguished particularly as an alienist and by his work on the brain, he had been seeking to ascertain by these questions whether my grandmother\u2019s memory was in good order. As though reluctantly he began to inquire about her past life, fixing a stern and sombre eye on her. Then suddenly, as though catching sight of the truth and determined to reach it at all costs, with a preliminary rubbing of his hands, which he seemed to have some difficulty in wiping dry of the final hesitations which he himself might feel and of all the objections which we might have raised, looking down at my grandmother with a lucid eye, boldly and as though he were at last upon solid ground, punctuating his words in a quiet, impressive tone, every inflexion of which bore the mark of intellect, he began. (His voice, for that matter, throughout this visit remained what it naturally was, caressing. And under his bushy brows his ironical eyes were full of kindness.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou will be quite well, Madame, on the day \u2014 when it comes, and it rests entirely with you whether it comes to-day \u2014 on which you realise that there is nothing wrong with you, and resume your ordinary life. You tell me that you have not been taking your food, not going out?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Sir, I have a temperature.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He laid a finger on her wrist\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot just now, at any rate. Besides, what an excuse! Don\u2019t you know that we keep out in the open air and overfeed tuberculous patients with temperatures of 102?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I have a little albumen as well.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou ought not to know anything about that. You have what I have had occasion to call \u2018mental albumen.\u2019 We have all of us had, when we have not been very well, little albuminous phases which our doctor has done his best to make permanent by calling our attention to them. For one disorder that doctors cure with drugs (as I am told that they do occasionally succeed in doing) they produce a dozen others in healthy subjects by inoculating them with that pathogenic agent a thousand times more virulent than all the microbes in the world, the idea that one is ill. A belief of that sort, which has a disturbing effect on any temperament, acts with special force on neurotic people. Tell them that a shut window is open behind their back, they will begin to sneeze; make them believe that you have put magnesia in their soup, they will be seized with colic; that their coffee is stronger than usual, they will not sleep a wink all night. Do you imagine, Madame, that I needed to do any more than look into your eyes, listen to the way in which you express yourself, look, if I may say so, at this lady, your daughter, and at your grandson, who takes so much after you, to learn what was the matter with you?\u201d \u201cYour grandmother might perhaps go and sit, if the Doctor allows it, in some quiet path in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, near that laurel shrubbery where you used to play when you were little,\u201d said my mother to me, thus indirectly consulting Dr. du Boulbon, her voice for that reason assuming a tone of timid deference which it would not have had if she had been addressing me alone. The Doctor turned to my grandmother and, being apparently as well-read in literature as in science, adjured her as follows: \u201cGo to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, Madame, to the laurel shrubbery which your grandson loves. The laurel you will find health-giving. It purifies. After he had exterminated the serpent Python, it was with a bough of laurel in his hand that Apollo made his entry into Delphi. He sought thus to guard himself from the deadly germs of the venomous monster. So you see that the laurel is the most ancient, the most venerable and, I will add \u2014 what is of therapeutic as well as of prophylactic value \u2014 the most beautiful of antiseptics.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In as much as a great part of what doctors know is taught them by the sick, they are easily led to believe that this knowledge which patients exhibit is common to them all, and they pride themselves on taking the patient of the moment by surprise with some remark picked up at a previous bedside. Thus it was with the superior smile of a Parisian who, in conversation with a peasant, might hope to surprise him by using suddenly a word of the local dialect that Dr. du Boulbon said to my grandmother: \u201cProbably a windy night will make you sleep when the strongest soporifics would have no effect.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary, Sir, when the wind blows I can never sleep at all.\u201d But doctors are touchy people. \u201cAch!\u201d muttered du Boulbon, knitting his brows, as if some one had trodden on his toe, or as if my grandmother\u2019s sleeplessness on stormy nights were a personal insult to himself. He had not, however, an undue opinion of himself, and since, in his character as a \u2018superior\u2019 person, he felt himself bound not to put any faith in medicine, he quickly recovered his philosophic serenity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother, in her passionate longing for reassurance from Bergotte\u2019S friend, added in support of his verdict that a first cousin of my grandmother, who suffered from a nervous complaint, had lain for seven years cloistered in her bedroom at Combray, without leaving her bed more than once or twice a week\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou see, Madame, I didn\u2019t know that, and yet I could have told you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Sir, I am not in the least like her; on the contrary, my doctor complains that he cannot get me to stay in bed,\u201d said my grandmother, whether because she was a little annoyed by the doctor\u2019s theories, or was anxious to submit to him any objections that might be raised to them, in the hope that he would refute these and that, after he had gone, she would no longer find any doubt lurking in her own mind as to the accuracy of his encouraging diagnosis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, naturally, Madame, you cannot have all the forms of \u2014 if you\u2019ll excuse my saying so \u2014 mania at once; you have others, but not that particular one. Yesterday I visited a home for neurasthenics. In the garden, I saw a man standing on a seat, motionless as a fakir, his neck bent in a position which must have been highly uncomfortable. On my asking him what he was doing there, he replied, without turning his head, or moving a muscle: \u2018You see, Doctor, I am extremely rheumatic and catch cold very easily; I have just been taking a lot of exercise, and while I was getting hot, like a fool, my neck was touching my flannels. If I move it away from my flannels now before letting myself cool down, I am certain to get a stiff neck, and possibly bronchitis.\u2019 Which he would, in fact, have done. \u2018You\u2019re a fine specimen of neurasthenia, that\u2019s what you are,\u2019 I told him. And do you know what argument he advanced to prove that I was mistaken? It was this; that while all the other patients in the place had a mania for testing their weight, so much so that the weighing machine had to be padlocked so that they should not spend the whole day on it, he had to be lifted on to it bodily, so little did he care to be weighed. He prided himself on not sharing the mania of the others without thinking that he had also one of his own, and that it was this which saved him from the other. You must not be offended by the comparison, Madame, for the man who dared not turn his neck for fear of catching a chill is the greatest poet of our day. That poor maniac is the most lofty intellect that I know. Submit to being called a neurotic. You belong to that splendid and pitiable family which is the salt of the earth. All the greatest things We know have come to us from neurotics. It is they and they only who have founded religions and created great works of art. Never will the world be conscious of how much it owes to them, nor above all of what they have suffered in order to bestow their gifts on it. We enjoy fine music, beautiful pictures, a thousand exquisite things, but we do not know what they cost those who wrought them in sleeplessness, tears, spasmodic laughter, rashes, asthma, epilepsy a terror of death which is worse than any of these, and which you perhaps have felt, Madame,\u201d he added with a smile at my grandmother, \u201cfor confess now, when I came into the room, you were not feeling very confident You thought that you were ill; dangerously ill, perhaps. Heaven only knows what the disease was of which you thought you had detected the symptoms. And you were not mistaken; they were there. Neurosis has an absolute genius for malingering. There is no illness which it cannot counterfeit perfectly. It will produce life-like imitations of the dilatations of dyspepsia, the sicknesses of pregnancy, the broken rhythm of the cardiac, the feverishness of the consumptive. If it is capable of deceiving the doctor how should it fail to deceive the patient? No, no; you mustn\u2019t think I\u2019m making fun of your sufferings. I should not undertake to heal them unless I understood them thoroughly. And, well, they say there\u2019s no good confession unless it\u2019s mutual. I have told you that without nervous trouble there can be no great artist. What is more,\u201d he added, raising a solemn forefinger, \u201cthere can be no great scientist either. I will go further, and say that, unless he himself is subject to nervous trouble, he is not, I won\u2019t say a good doctor, but I do say the right doctor to treat nervous troubles. In nervous pathology a doctor who doesn\u2019t say too many foolish things is a patient half-cured, just as a critic is a poet who has stopped writing verse and a policeman a burglar who has retired from practice. I, Madame, I do not, like you, fancy myself to be suffering from albuminuria, I have not your nervous fear of food, nor of fresh air, but I can never go to sleep without getting out of bed at least twenty times to see if my door is shut. And in that home where I found the poet yesterday who would not move his neck, I had gone to secure a room, for \u2014 this is between ourselves \u2014 I spend my holidays there looking after myself when I have increased my own trouble by wearing myself out in the attempt to cure other people.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut do you want me to take a cure like that, Sir?\u201d came to a frightened voice from my grandmother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is not necessary, Madame. The symptoms which you describe will vanish at my bidding. Besides, you have with you a very efficient person whom I appoint as your doctor from now onwards. That is your trouble itself, the super-activity of your nerves. Even if I knew how to cure you of that, I should take good care not to. All I need do is to control it. I see on your table there one of Bergotte\u2019s books. Cured of your neurosis you would no longer care for it. Well, I might feel it my duty to substitute for the joys that it procures for you a nervous stability which would be quite incapable of giving you those joys. But those joys themselves are a strong remedy, the strongest of all perhaps. No; I have nothing to say against your nervous energy. All I ask is that it should listen to me; I leave you in its charge. It must reverse its engines. The force which it is now using to prevent you from getting up, from taking sufficient food, let it employ in making you eat, in making you read, in making you go out, and in distracting you in every possible way. You needn\u2019t tell me that you are fatigued. Fatigue is the organic realisation of a preconceived idea. Begin by not thinking it. And if ever you have a slight indisposition, which is a thing that may happen to anyone, it will be just as if you hadn\u2019t it, for your nervous energy will have endowed you with what M. de Talleyrand, in an expression full of meaning, called \u2018imaginary health.\u2019 See, it has begun to cure you already, you have been sitting up in bed listening to me without once leaning back on your pillows; your eye is bright, your complexion is good, I have been talking to you for half an hour by the clock and you have never noticed the time. Well, Madame, I shall now bid you good-day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, after seeing Dr. du Boulbon to the door, I returned to the room in which my mother was by herself, the oppression that had been weighing on me for the last few weeks lifted, I felt that my mother was going to break out with a cry of joy and would see my joy, I felt that inability to endure the suspense of the coming moment at which a person is going to be overcome with emotion in our presence, which in another category is a little like the thrill of fear that goes through one when one knows that somebody is going to come in and startle one by a door that is still closed; I tried to speak to Mamma but my voice broke, and, bursting into tears, I stayed for a long time, my head on her shoulder, crying, tasting, accepting, relishing my grief, now that I knew that it had departed from my life, as we like to exalt ourselves by forming virtuous plans which circumstances do not permit us to put into execution. Fran\u00e7oise annoyed me by her refusal to share in our joy. She was quite overcome because there had just been a terrible scene between the lovesick footman and the tale-bearing porter. It had required the Duchess herself, in her unfailing benevolence, to intervene, restore an apparent calm to the household and forgive the footman. For she was a good mistress, and that would have been the ideal \u2018place\u2019 if only she didn\u2019t listen to \u2018stories.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the last few days people had begun to hear of my grandmother\u2019s illness and to inquire for news of her. Saint-Loup had written to me: \u201cI do not wish to take advantage of a time when your dear grandmother is unwell to convey to you what is far more than mere reproaches, on a matter with which she has no concern. But I should not be speaking the truth were I to say to you, even out of politeness, that I shall ever forget the perfidy of your conduct, or that there can ever be any forgiveness for so scoundrelly a betrayal.\u201d But some other friends, supposing that my grandmother was not seriously ill (they may not even have known that she was ill at all), had asked me to meet them next day in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, to go with them from there to pay a call together, ending up with a dinner in the country, the thought of which appealed to me. I had no longer any reason to forego these two pleasures. When my grandmother had been told that it was now imperative, if she was to obey Dr. du Boulbon\u2019s orders, that she should go out as much as possible, she had herself at once suggested the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. It would be easy for me to escort her there; and, while she sat reading, to arrange with my friends where I should meet them later; and I should still be in time, if I made haste, to take the train with them to Ville d\u2019Avray. When the time came, my grandmother did not want to go out; she felt tired. But my mother, acting on du Boulbon\u2019s instructions, had the strength of mind to be firm and to insist on obedience. She was almost in tears at the thought that my grandmother was going to relapse again into her nervous weakness, which she might never be able to shake off. Never again would there be such a fine, warm day for an outing. The sun as it moved through the sky interspersed here and there in the broken solidity of the balcony its unsubstantial muslins, and gave to the freestone ledge a warm epidermis, an indefinite halo of gold. As Fran\u00e7oise had not had time to send a \u2018tube\u2019 to her daughter, she left us immediately after luncheon. She very kindly consented, however, to call first at Jupien\u2019s, to get a stitch put in the cloak which my grandmother was going to wear. Returning at that moment from my morning walk I accompanied her into the shop. \u201cIs it your young master who brings you here,\u201d Jupien asked Fran\u00e7oise, \u201cis it you who are bringing him to see me or is it some good wind and fortune that bring you both?\u201d For all his want of education, Jupien respected the laws of grammar as instinctively as M. de Guermantes, in spite of every effort, broke them. With Fran\u00e7oise gone and the cloak mended, it was time for my grandmother to get ready. Having obstinately refused to let Mamma stay in the room with her, she took, left to herself, an endless time over her dressing, and now that I knew her to be quite well, with that strange indifference which we feel towards our relatives so long as they are alive, which makes us put everyone else before them, I felt it to be very selfish of her to take so long, to risk making me late when she knew that I had an appointment with my friends and was dining at Ville d\u2019Avray. In my impatience I finally went downstairs without waiting for her, after I had twice been told that she was just ready. At last she joined me, without apologising to me, as she generally did, for having kept me waiting, flushed and bothered like a person who has come to a place in a hurry and has forgotten half her belongings, just as I was reaching the half-opened glass door which, without warming them with it in the least, let in the liquid, throbbing, tepid air from the street (as though the sluices of a reservoir had been opened) between the frigid walls of the passage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, dear, if you\u2019re going to meet your friends I ought to have put on another cloak. I look rather poverty-stricken in this one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was startled to see her so flushed, and supposed that having begun by making herself late she had had to hurry over her dressing. When we left the cab at the end of the Avenue Gabriel, in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, I saw my grandmother, without a word to me, turn aside and make her way to the little old pavilion with its green trellis, at the door of which I had once waited for Fran\u00e7oise. The same park-keeper who had been standing there then was still talking to Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s \u2018Marquise\u2019 when, following my grandmother who, doubtless because she was feeling sick, had her hand in front of her mouth, I climbed the steps of that little rustic theatre, erected there among the gardens. At the entrance, as in those circus booths where the clown, dressed for the ring and smothered in flour, stands at the door and takes the money himself for the seats, the \u2018Marquise,\u2019 at the receipt of custom, was still there in her place with her huge, uneven face smeared with a coarse plaster and her little bonnet of red flowers and black lace surmounting her auburn wig. But I do not suppose that she recognised me. The park-keeper, abandoning his watch over the greenery, with the colour of which his uniform had been designed to harmonise, was talking to her, on a chair by her side\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you\u2019re still here?\u201d he was saying. \u201cYou don\u2019t think of retiring?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd what have I to retire for, Sir? Will you kindly tell me where I shall be better off than here, where I should live more at my ease, and with every comfort? And then there\u2019s all the coming and going, plenty of distraction; my little Paris, I call it; my customers keep me in touch with everything that\u2019s going on. Just to give you an example, there\u2019s one of them who went out not more than five minutes ago; he\u2019s a magistrate, in the very highest position there is. Very well, Sir,\u201d she cried with ardour, as though prepared to maintain the truth of this assertion by violence, should the agent of civic authority shew any sign of challenging its accuracy, \u201cfor the last eight years, do you follow me, every day God has made, regularly on the stroke of three he\u2019s been here, always polite, never saying one word louder than another, never making any mess; and he stays half an hour and more to read his papers and do his little jobs. There was one day he didn\u2019t come. I never noticed it at the time, but that evening, all of a sudden I said to myself: \u2018Why, that gentleman never came to-day; perhaps he\u2019s dead!\u2019 And that gave me a regular turn, you know, because, of course, I get quite fond of people when they behave nicely. And so I was very glad when I saw him come in again next day, and I said to him, I did: \u2018I hope there was nothing wrong yesterday, Sir?\u2019 Then he told me that it was his wife that had died, and he\u2019d been so put out, poor gentleman, what with one thing and another, he hadn\u2019t been able to come. He had that really sad look, you know, people have when they\u2019ve been married five-and-twenty years, and then the parting, but he seemed pleased, all the same, to be back here. You could see that all his little habits had been quite upset. I did what I could to make him feel at home. I said to him: \u2018Y\u2019 mustn\u2019t let go of things, Sir. Just come here the same as before, it will be a little distraction for you in your sorrow.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u2018Marquise\u2019 resumed a gentler tone, for she had observed that the guardian of groves and lawns was listening to her complacently and with no thought of contradiction, keeping harmlessly in its scabbard a sword which looked more like a horticultural implement or some symbol of a garden-god\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd besides,\u201d she went on, \u201cI choose my customers, I don\u2019t let everyone into my little parlours, as I call them. And doesn\u2019t the place just look like a parlour with all my flowers? Such friendly customers I have; there\u2019s always some one or other brings me a spray of nice lilac, or jessamine or roses; my favourite flowers, roses are.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The thought that we were perhaps despised by this lady because we never brought any sprays of lilac or fine roses to her bower made me redden, and in the hope of making a bodily escape \u2014 or of being condemned only by default \u2014 from an adverse judgment, I moved towards the exit. But it is not always in this world the people who bring us fine roses to whom we are most friendly, for the \u2018Marquise,\u2019 thinking that I was bored, turned to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like me to open a little place for you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, on my declining:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo? You\u2019re sure you won\u2019t?\u201d she persisted, smiling. \u201cWell, just as you please. You\u2019re welcome to it, but I know quite well, not having to pay for a thing won\u2019t make you want to do it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this moment a shabbily dressed woman hurried into the place who seemed to be feeling precisely the want in question. But she did not belong to the \u2018Marquise\u2019s\u2019 world, for the latter, with the ferocity of a snob, flung at her:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve nothing disengaged, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWill they be long?\u201d asked the poor lady, reddening beneath the yellow flowers in her hat\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, Ma\u2019am, if you\u2019ll take my advice, you\u2019ll try somewhere else; you see, there are still these two gentlemen waiting, and I\u2019ve only one closet; the others are out of order.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot much money there,\u201d she explained when the other had gone. \u201cIt\u2019s not the sort we want here, either; they\u2019re not clean, don\u2019t treat the place with respect, it would be your humble here that would have to spend the next hour cleaning up after her ladyship. I\u2019m not sorry to lose her penny.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally my grandmother emerged, and feeling that she probably would not seek to atone by a lavish gratuity for the indiscretion that she had shewn by remaining so long inside, I beat a retreat, so as not to have to share in the scorn which the \u2018Marquise\u2019 would no doubt heap on her, and began strolling along a path, but slowly, so that my grandmother should not have to hurry to overtake me; as presently she did. I expected her to begin: \u201cI am afraid I\u2019ve kept you waiting; I hope you\u2019ll still be in time for your friends,\u201d but she did not utter a single word, so much so that, feeling a little hurt, I was disinclined to speak first; until looking up at her I noticed that as she walked beside me she kept her face turned the other way. I was afraid that her heart might be troubling her again. I studied her more carefully and was struck by the disjointedness of her gait. Her hat was crooked, her cloak stained; she had the confused and worried look, the flushed, slightly dazed face of a person who has just been knocked down by a carriage or pulled out of a ditch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was afraid you were feeling sick, Grandmamma; are you feeling better now?\u201d I asked her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Probably she thought that it would be impossible for her, without alarming me, not to make some answer\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI heard the whole of her conversation with the keeper,\u201d she told me. \u201cCould anything have been more typical of the Guermantes, or the Verdurins and their little circle? Heavens, what fine language she put it all in!\u201d And she quoted, with deliberate application, this sentence from her own special Marquise, Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u201cAs I listened to them I thought that they were preparing for me the pleasures of a farewell.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such was the speech that she made me, a speech into which she had put all her critical delicacy, her love of quotations, her memory of the classics more thoroughly even than she would naturally have done, and as though to prove that she retained possession of all these faculties. But I guessed rather than heard what she said, so inaudible was the voice in which she muttered her sentences, clenching her teeth more than could be accounted for by the fear of being sick again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome!\u201d I said lightly, so as not to seem to be taking her illness too seriously, \u201csince your heart is bothering you, shall we go home now? I don\u2019t want to trundle a grandmother with indigestion about the Champs-Elys\u00e9es.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t like to suggest it, because of your friends,\u201d she replied. \u201cPoor boy! But if you don\u2019t mind, I think it would be wiser.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was afraid of her noticing the strange way in which she uttered these words\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome!\u201d I said to her sharply, \u201cyou mustn\u2019t tire yourself talking; if your heart is bad, it\u2019s silly; wait till we get home.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She smiled at me sorrowfully and gripped my hand. She had realised that there was no need to hide from me what I had at once guessed, that she had had a slight stroke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We made our way back along the Avenue Gabriel, through the strolling crowd. I left my grandmother to rest on a seat and went in search of a cab. She, in whose heart I always placed myself when I had to form an opinion of the most unimportant person, she was now closed to me, had become part of the world outside, and, more than from any casual passerby, I was obliged to keep from her what I thought of her condition, to say no word of my uneasiness. I could not have spoken of it to her in greater confidence than to a stranger. She had suddenly handed back to me the thoughts, the griefs which, from the days of my infancy, I had entrusted for all time to her keeping. She was not yet dead. I was already alone. And even those allusions which she had made to the Guermantes, to Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, to our conversations about the little clan, assumed an air of being without point or occasion, fantastic, because they sprang from the nullity of this very being who to-morrow possibly would have ceased to exist, for whom they would no longer have any meaning, from that nullity, incapable of conceiving them, which my grandmother would shortly be\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, Sir, I don\u2019t like to say no, but you have not made an appointment, you have no time fixed. Besides, this is not my day for seeing patients. You surely have a doctor of your own. I cannot interfere with his practice, unless he were to call me in for a consultation. It\u2019s a question of professional etiquette . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as I was signalling to a cabman, I had caught sight of the famous Professor E\u2014 \u2014 almost a friend of my father and grandfather, acquainted at any rate with them both, who lived in the Avenue Gabriel, and, with a sudden inspiration, had stopped him just as he was entering his house, thinking that he would perhaps be the very person to advise my grandmother. But he was evidently in a hurry and, after calling for his letters, seemed anxious to get rid of me, so that my only chance of speaking to him lay in going up with him in the lift, of which he begged me to allow him to work the switches himself, this being a mania with him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Sir, I am not asking you to see my grandmother here; you will realise from what I am trying to tell you that she is not in a fit state to come; what I am asking is that you should call at our house in half an hour\u2019s time, when I have taken her home.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCall at your house! Really, Sir, you must not expect me to do that. I am dining with the Minister of Commerce. I have a call to pay first. I must change at once, and to make matters worse I have torn my coat and my\u2019 other one has no buttonholes for my. decorations. I beg you, please, to oblige me by not touching the switches. You don\u2019t know how the lift works; one can\u2019t be too careful. Getting that buttonhole made means more delay. Well, as I am a friend of your people, if your grandmother comes here at once I will see her. But I warn you that I shall be able to give her exactly a quarter of an hour, nor a moment more.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had started off at once, without even getting out of the lift which Professor E\u2014\u2014-had himself set in motion to take me down again, casting a suspicious glance at me as he did so\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We may, indeed, say that the hour of death is uncertain, but when we say so we represent that hour to ourselves as situated in a vague and remote expanse of time, it never occurs to us that it can have any connexion with the day that has already dawned, or may signify that death \u2014 or its first assault and partial possession of us, after which it will never leave hold of us again \u2014 may occur this very afternoon, so far from uncertain, this afternoon every hour of which has already been allotted to some occupation. You make a point of taking your drive every day so that in a month\u2019s time you will have had the full benefit of the fresh air; you have hesitated over which cloak you will take, which cabman to call, you are in the cab, the whole day lies before you, short because you have to be at home early, as a friend is coming to see you; you hope that it will be as fine again to-morrow; and you have no suspicion that death, which has been making its way towards you along another plane, shrouded in an impenetrable darkness, has chosen precisely this day of all days to make its appearance, in a few minutes\u2019 time, more or less, at the moment when the carriage has reached the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Perhaps those who are haunted as a rule by the fear of the utter strangeness of death will find something reassuring in this kind of death \u2014 in this kind of first contact with death \u2014 because death thus assumes a known, familiar guise of everyday life. A good luncheon has preceded it, and the same outing that people take who are in perfect health. A drive home in an open carriage comes on top of its first onslaught; ill as my grandmother was, there were, after all, several people who could testify that at six o\u2019clock, as we came home from the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, they had bowed to her as she drove past in an open carriage, in perfect weather. Legrandin, making his way towards the Place de la Concorde, raised his hat to us, stopping to look after us with an air of surprise. I, who was not yet detached from life, asked my grandmother if she had acknowledged his greeting, reminding her of his readiness to take offence. My grandmother, thinking me no doubt very frivolous, raised her hand in the air as though to say: \u201cWhat does it matter? It is not of the least importance.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes, one might have said that, a few minutes earlier, when I was looking for a cab, my grandmother was resting on a seat in the Avenue Gabriel, and that a little later she had driven past in an open carriage. But would that have been really true? The seat, for instance, to maintain its position at the side of an avenue \u2014 for all that it may be subjected also to certain conditions of equilibrium \u2014 has no need of energy. But in order that a living person may be stable, even when supported by a seat or in a carriage, there is required a tension of forces which we do not ordinarily perceive any more than we perceive (because its action is universal) atmospheric pressure. Possibly if we were to be hollowed out and then left to support the pressure of the air we might feel, in the moment that preceded our extinction, that terrible weight which there was nothing left in us to neutralise. Similarly when the abyss of sickness and death opens within us and we have no longer any resistance to offer to the tumult with which the world and our own body rush upon us, then to endure even the tension of our own muscles, the shudder that freezes us to the marrow, then even to keep ourselves motionless in what we ordinarily regard as nothing but the simple negative position of a lifeless thing requires, if we wish our head to remain erect and our eyes calm, an expense of vital energy and becomes the object of an exhausting struggle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if Legrandin had looked back at us with that astonished air, it was because to him, as to the other people who passed us then, in the cab in which my grandmother was apparently seated she had seemed to be foundering, sliding into the abyss, clinging desperately to the cushions which could barely arrest the downward plunge of her body, her hair in disorder, her eye wild, unable any longer to face the assault of the images which its pupil was not strong enough now to bear. She had appeared to them, although I was still by her side, submerged in that unknown world somewhere in which she had already received the blows, traces of which she still bore when I looked up at her a few minutes earlier in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, her hat, her face, her cloak left in disorder by the hand of the invisible angel with whom she had wrestled. I have thought, since, that this moment of her stroke cannot have altogether surprised my grandmother, that indeed she had perhaps foreseen it a long time back, had lived in expectation of it. She had not known, naturally, when this fatal moment would come, had never been certain, any more than those lovers whom a similar doubt leads alternately to found unreasonable hopes and unjustified suspicions on the fidelity of their mistresses. But it is rarely that these grave maladies, like that which now at last had struck her full in the face, do not take up their abode in the sick man for a long time before killing him, during which time they make haste, like a \u2018sociable\u2019 neighbour or tenant, to introduce themselves to him. A terrible acquaintance, not so much from the sufferings that it causes as from the strange novelty of the definite restriction which it imposes upon life. A woman sees herself dying, in these cases not at the actual moment of death but months, sometimes years before, when death has hideously come to dwell in her. The sufferer makes the acquaintance of the stranger whom she hears coming and going in her brain. She does not know him by sight, it is true, but from the sounds which she hears him regularly make she can form an idea of his habits. Is he a criminal? One morning, she can no longer hear him. He has gone. Ah! If it were only for ever! In the evening he has returned. What are his plans? Her specialist, put to the question, like an adored mistress, replies with avowals that one day are believed, another day fail to convince her. Or rather it is not the mistress\u2019s part but that of the servants one interrogates that the doctor plays. They are only third parties. The person whom we press for an answer, whom we suspect of being about to play us false, is life itself, and although we feel her to be no longer the same we believe in her still or at least remain undecided until the day on which she finally abandons us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I helped my grandmother into Professor E\u2014\u2014\u2018s lift and a moment later he came to us and took us into his consulting room. But there, busy as he was, his bombastic manner changed, such is the force of habit; for his habit was to be friendly, that is to say lively with his patients. Since he knew that my grandmother was a great reader, and was himself one also, he devoted the first few minutes to quoting various favourite passages of poetry appropriate to the glorious summer weather. He had placed her in an armchair and himself with his back to the light so as to have a good view of her. His examination was minute and thorough, even obliging me at one moment to leave the room. He continued it after my return, then, having finished, went on, although the quarter of an hour was almost at an end, repeating various quotations to my grandmother. He even made a few jokes, which were witty enough, though I should have preferred to hear them on some other occasion, but which completely reassured me by the tone of amusement in which he uttered them. I then remembered that M. Falli\u00e8res, the President of the Senate, had, many years earlier, had a false seizure, and that to the consternation of his political rivals he had returned a few days later to his duties and had begun, it was said, his preparations for a more or less remote succession to the Presidency of the Republic. My confidence in my grandmother\u2019s prompt recovery was all the more complete in that, just as I was recalling the example of M. Falli\u00e8res, I was distracted from following up the similarity by a shout of laughter, which served as conclusion to one of the Professor\u2019s jokes. After which he took out his watch, wrinkled his brows petulantly on seeing that he was five minutes late, and while he bade us good-bye rang for his other coat to be brought to him at once. I waited until my grandmother had left the room, closed the door and asked him to tell me the truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere is not the slightest hope,\u201d he informed me. \u201cIt is a stroke brought on by uraemia. In itself, uraemia is not necessarily fatal, but this case seems to me desperate. I need not tell you that I hope I am mistaken. Anyhow, you have Cottard, you\u2019re in excellent hands. Excuse me,\u201d he broke off as a maid came into the room with his coat over her arm. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m dining with the Minister of Commerce, and I have a call to pay first. Ah! Life is not all a bed of roses, as one is apt to think at your age.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he graciously offered me his hand. I had shut the door behind me, and a footman was shewing us into the hall when we heard a loud shout of rage. The maid had forgotten to cut and hem the buttonhole for the decorations. This would take another ten minutes. The Professor continued to storm while I stood on the landing gazing at a grandmother for whom there was not the slightest hope. Each of us is indeed alone. We started for home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sun was sinking, it burnished an interminable wall along which our cab had to pass before reaching the street in which we lived, a wall against which the shadow cast by the setting sun of horse and carriage stood out in black on a ruddy background, like a funeral car on some Pompeian terra-cotta. At length we arrived at the house. I made the invalid sit at the foot of the staircase in the hall, and went up to warn my mother. I told her that my grandmother had come home feeling slightly unwell, after an attack of giddiness. As soon as I began to speak, my mother\u2019s face was convulsed by the paroxysm of a despair which was yet already so resigned that I realised that for many years she had been holding herself quietly in readiness for an uncalendared but final day. She asked me no question; it seemed that, just as malevolence likes to exaggerate the sufferings of other people, so in her devotion she would not admit that her mother was seriously ill, especially with a disease which might affect the brain. Mamma shuddered, her eyes wept without tears, she ran to give orders for the doctor to be fetched at once; but when Fran\u00e7oise asked who was ill she could not reply, her voice stuck in her throat. She came running downstairs with me struggling to banish from her face the sob that contracted it. My grandmother was waiting below on the sofa in the hall, but, as soon as she heard us coming, drew herself together, stood up, and waved her hand cheerfully at Mamma. I had partially wrapped her head in a white lace shawl, telling her that it was so that she should not catch cold on the stairs. I had hoped that my mother would not notice the change in her face, the distortion of her mouth; my precaution proved unnecessary; my mother went up to my grandmother, kissed her hand as though it were that of her God, raised her up, carried her to the lift with infinite precautions in which there was, with the fear of hurting her by any clumsy movement, the humility of one who felt herself unworthy to touch the most precious thing, to her, in the world, but never once did she raise her eyes, nor look at the sufferer\u2019s face. Perhaps this was in order that my grandmother might not be saddened by the thought that the sight of her could alarm her daughter. Perhaps from fear of a grief so piercing that she dared not face it. Perhaps from reverence, because she did not feel it permissible to herself, without impiety, to remark the trace of any mental weakening on those venerated features. Perhaps to be better able to preserve intact in her memory the image of the true face of my grandmother, radiant with wisdom and goodness. So they went up side by side, my grandmother half hidden by her shawl, my mother turning away her eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile there was one person who never took hers from what could be made out of my grandmother\u2019s altered features, at which her daughter dared not look, a person who fastened on them a gaze wondering, indiscreet and of evil omen: this was Fran\u00e7oise. Not that she was not sincerely attached to my grandmother (indeed she had been disappointed and almost scandalised by the coldness shewn by Mamma, whom she would have liked to see fling herself weeping into her mother\u2019s arms), but she had a certain tendency always to look at the worse side of things, she had retained from her childhood two peculiarities which would seem to be mutually exclusive, but which when combined strengthened one another: the want of restraint common among people of humble origin who make no attempt to conceal the impression, in other words the painful alarm, aroused in them by the sight of a physical change which it would be in better taste to appear not to notice, and the unfeeling coarseness of the peasant who begins by tearing the wings off dragon-flies until she is allowed to wring the necks of chickens, and lacks that modesty which would make her conceal the interest that she feels in the sight of suffering flesh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, thanks to the faultless ministrations of Fran\u00e7oise, my grandmother had been put to bed, she discovered that she could speak much more easily, the little rupture or obstruction of a blood-vessel which had produced the uraemia having apparently been quite slight. And at once she was anxious not to fail Mamma in her hour of need, to assist her in the most cruel moments through which she had yet had to pass\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, my child,\u201d she began, taking my mother\u2019s hand in one of her own, and keeping the other in front of her lips, so as to account for the slight difficulty which she still found in uttering certain words. \u201cSo this is all the pity you shew your mother! You look as if you thought that indigestion was quite a pleasant thing!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then for the first time my mother\u2019s eyes gazed passionately into those of my grandmother, not wishing to see the rest of her face, and she replied, beginning the list of those false promises which we swear but are unable to fulfil:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMamma, you will soon be quite well again, your daughter will see to that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And embodying all her dearest love, all her determination that her mother should recover, in a kiss to which she entrusted them, and which she followed with her mind, with her whole being until it flowered upon her lips, she bent down to lay it humbly, reverently upon the precious brow. My grandmother complained of a sort of alluvial deposit of bedclothes which kept gathering all the time in the same place, over her left leg, and from which she could never manage to free herself. But she did not realise that she was herself the cause of this (so that day after day she accused Fran\u00e7oise unjustly of not \u2018doing\u2019 her bed properly). By a convulsive movement she kept flinging to that side the whole flood of those billowing blankets of fine wool, which gathered there like the sand in a bay which is very soon transformed into a beach (unless the inhabitants construct a breakwater) by the successive deposits of the tide\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother and I (whose falsehood was exposed before we spoke by the obnoxious perspicacity of Fran\u00e7oise) would not even admit that my grandmother was seriously ill, as though such an admission might give pleasure to her enemies (not that she had any) and it was more loving to feel that she was not so bad as all that, in short from the same instinctive sentiment which had led me to suppose that Andr\u00e9e was too sorry for Al-bertine to be really fond of her. The same individual phenomena are reproduced in the mass, in great crises. In a war, the man who does not love his country says nothing against it, but regards it as lost, commiserates it, sees everything in the darkest colours\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise was of infinite value to us owing to her faculty of doing without sleep, of performing the most arduous tasks. And if, when she had gone to bed after several nights spent in the sick-room, we were obliged to call her a quarter of an hour after she had fallen asleep, she was so happy to be able to do the most tiring duties as if they had been the simplest things in the world that, so far from looking cross, her face would light up with a satisfaction tinged with modesty. Only when the time came for mass, or for breakfast, then, had my grandmother been in her death agony, still Fran\u00e7oise would have quietly slipped away so as not to make herself late. She neither could nor would let her place be taken by her young footman. It was true that she had brought from Combray an extremely exalted idea of everyone\u2019s duty towards ourselves; she would not have tolerated that any of our servants should \u2018fail\u2019 us. This doctrine had made her so noble, so imperious, so efficient an instructor that there had never come to our house any servants, however corrupted who had not speedily modified, purified their conception of life so far as to refuse to touch the usual commissions from tradesmen and to come rushing \u2014 however little they might previously have sought to oblige \u2014 to take from my hands and not let me tire myself by carrying the smallest package. But at Combray Fran\u00e7oise had contracted also \u2014 and had brought with her to Paris \u2014 the habit of not being able to put up with any assistance in her work. The sight of anyone coming to help her seemed to her like receiving a deadly insult, and servants had remained for weeks in the house without receiving from her any response to their morning greeting, had even gone off on their holidays without her bidding them good-bye or their guessing her reason, which was simply and solely that they had offered to do a share of her work on some day when she had not been well. And at this moment when my grandmother was so ill Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s duties seemed to her peculiarly her own. She would not allow herself, she, the official incumbent, to be done out of her part in the ritual of these festal days. And so her young footman, sent packing by her, did not know what to do with himself, and not content with having copied the butler\u2019s example and supplied himself with note-paper from my desk had begun as well to borrow volumes of poetry from my bookshelves. He sat reading them for a good half of the day, out of admiration for the poets who had written them, but also so as, during the rest of his time, to begem with quotations the letters which he wrote to his friends in his native village. Naturally he expected these to dazzle them. But as there was little sequence in his ideas he had formed the notion that these poems, picked out at random from my shelves, were matters of common knowledge, to which it was customary to refer. So much so that in writing to these peasants, whose stupefaction he discounted, he interspersed his own reflexions with lines from Lamartine, just as he might have said \u201cWho laughs last, laughs longest!\u201d or merely \u201cHow are you keeping?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To ease her pain my grandmother was given morphine. Unfortunately, if this relieved her in other ways, it increased the quantity of albumen. The blows which we aimed at the wicked ogre who had taken up his abode in my grandmother were always wide of the mark, and it was she, her poor interposed body that had to bear them, without her ever uttering more than a faint groan by way of complaint. And the pain that we caused her found no compensation in a benefit which we were unable to give her. The savage ogre whom we were anxious to exterminate we barely succeeded in touching, and all we did was to enrage him still further, and possibly hasten the moment at which he would devour his luckless captive. On certain days when the discharge of albumen had been excessive Cottard, after some hesitation, stopped the morphine. In this man, so insignificant, so common, there was, in these brief moments in which he deliberated, in which the relative dangers of one and another course of treatment presented themselves alternately to his mind until he arrived at a decision, the same sort of greatness as in a general who, vulgar in all the rest of his life, is a great strategist, and in an hour of peril, after a moment\u2019s reflexion, decides upon what is from the military point of view the wisest course, and gives the order: \u201cAdvance eastwards.\u201d Medically, however little hope there might be of setting any limit to this attack of uraemia, it did not do to tire the kidneys. But, on the other hand, when my grandmother did not have morphine, her pain became unbearable; she perpetually attempted a certain movement which it was difficult for her to perform without groaning. To a great extent, suffering is a sort of need felt by the organism to make itself familiar with a new state, which makes it uneasy, to adapt its sensibility to that state. We can discern this origin of pain in the case of certain inconveniences which are not such for everyone. Into a room filled with a pungent smoke two men of a coarse fibre will come and attend to their business; a third, more highly strung, will betray an incessant discomfort. His nostrils will continue to sniff anxiously the odour he ought, one would say, to try not to notice but will keep on attempting to attach, by a more exact apprehension of it, to his troubled sense of smell. One consequence of which may well be that his intense preoccupation will prevent him from complaining of a toothache. When my grandmother was in pain the sweat trickled over the pink expanse of her brow, glueing to it her white locks, and if she thought that none of us was in the room she would cry out: \u201cOh, it\u2019s dreadful!\u201d but if she caught sight of my mother, at once she employed all her energy in banishing from her face every sign of pain, or \u2014 an alternative stratagem \u2014 repeated the same plaints, accompanying them with explanations which gave a different sense, retrospectively, to those which my mother might have overheard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! My dear, it\u2019s dreadful to have to stay in bed on a beautiful sunny day like this when one wants to be out in the air; I am crying with rage at your orders.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she could not get rid of the look of anguish in her eyes, the sweat on her brow, the convulsive start, checked at once, of her limbs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere is nothing wrong. I\u2019m complaining because I\u2019m not lying very comfortably. I feel my hair is untidy, my heart is bad, I knocked myself against the wall.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And my mother, at the foot of the bed, riveted to that suffering form, as though, by dint of piercing with her gaze that pain-bedewed brow, that body which hid the evil thing within it, she could have succeeded in reaching that evil thing and carrying it away, my mother said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no, Mamma dear, we won\u2019t let you suffer like that, we will find something to take it away, have patience just for a moment; let me give you a kiss, darling \u2014 no, you\u2019re not to move.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And stooping over the bed, with bended knees, almost kneeling on the ground, as though by an exercise of humility she would have a better chance of making acceptable the impassioned gift of herself, she lowered towards my grandmother her whole life contained in her face as in a ciborium which she extended over her, adorned in relief with dimples and folds so passionate, so sorrowful, so sweet that one knew not whether they had been carved by the chisel of a kiss, a sob or a smile. My grandmother also, tried to lift up her face to Mamma\u2019s. It was so altered that probably\u2019 had she been strong enough to go out, she would have been recognised only by the feather in her hat. Her features, like the clay in a sculptor\u2019s hands seemed to be straining, with an effort which distracted her from everything else, to conform to some particular model which we failed to identify. This business of modelling was now almost finished, and if my grandmother\u2019s face had shrunk in the process it had at the same time hardened. The veins that ran beneath its surface seemed those not of a piece of marble but of some more rugged stone. Constantly thrust forwards by the difficulty that she found in breathing and as constantly forced back on to her pillow by exhaustion, her face, worn, diminished, terribly expressive, seemed like, in a primitive, almost prehistoric carving, the rude, flushed, purplish, desperate face of some savage guardian of a tomb. But the whole task was not yet accomplished. Next, her resistance must be overcome, and that tomb, the entrance to which she had so painfully guarded, with that tense contraction, entered\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In one of those moments in which, as the saying goes, one does not know what saint to invoke, as my grandmother was coughing and sneezing a good deal, we took the advice of a relative who assured us that if we sent for the specialist X \u2014\u2014-he would get rid of all that in a couple of days. People say that sort of thing about their own doctors, and their friends believe them just as Fran\u00e7oise always believed the advertisements in the newspapers. The specialist came with his bag packed with all the colds and coughs of his other patients, like Aeolus\u2019s bottle. My grandmother refused point-blank to let herself be examined. And we, out of consideration for the doctor, who had had his trouble for nothing, deferred to the desire that he expressed to inspect each of our noses in turn, albeit there was nothing the matter with any of them. According to him, however, there was; everything, whether headache or colic, heart-disease or diabetes, was a disease of the nose that had been wrongly diagnosed. To each of us he said: \u201cI should like to have another look at that little cornea. Don\u2019t put it off too long. I can soon get rid of it for you with a hot needle.\u201d We were, of course, thinking of something quite different. And yet we asked ourselves: \u201cGet rid of what?\u201d In a word, every one of our noses was diseased; his mistake lay only in his use of the present tense. For by the following day his examination and provisional treatment had taken effect. Each of us had his or her catarrh. And when in the street he ran into my father doubled up with a cough, he smiled to think that an ignorant layman might suppose the attack to be due to his intervention. He had examined us at a moment when we were already ill\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother\u2019s illness gave occasion to various people to manifest an excess or deficiency of sympathy which surprised us quite as much as the sort of chance which led one or another of them to reveal to us connecting links of circumstances, or of friendship for that matter, which we had never suspected. And the signs of interest shewn by the people who called incessantly at the house to inquire revealed to us the gravity of an illness which, until then, we had not sufficiently detached from the countless painful impressions that we received in my grandmother\u2019s room. Summoned by telegram, her sisters declined to leave Combray. They had discovered a musician there who gave them excellent chamber concerts, in listening to which they thought that they could find, better than by the invalid\u2019s bedside, food for thought, a melancholy exaltation the form of which was, to say the least of it, unusual. Mme. Sazerat wrote to Mamma, but in the tone of a person whom the sudden breaking off of a betrothal (the cause of the rupture being her Dreyfusism) has parted from one for ever. Bergotte, on the other hand, came every day and spent several hours with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had always made a habit of going regularly for some time to the same house, where, accordingly, he need not stand on ceremony. But formerly it had been in order that he might talk without being interrupted; now it was so that he might sit for as long as he chose in silence, without being expected to talk. For he was very ill, some people said with albuminuria, like my grandmother. According to another version, he had a tumour. He grew steadily weaker; it was with difficulty that he came up our staircase, with greater difficulty still that he went down it. Even though he held on to the banisters he often stumbled, and he would, I believe, have stayed at home had he not been afraid of losing altogether the habit of going out, the capacity to go out, he, the \u2018man with the little beard\u2019 whom I had seen so alert, not very long since. He was now quite blind and even his speech was frequently obstructed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But at the same time, by a directly opposite process, the body of his work, known only to a few literary people at the period when Mme. Swann used to patronise their timid efforts to disseminate it, now grown in stature and strength before the eyes of all, had acquired an extraordinary power of expansion among the general public. The general rule is, no doubt, that only after his death does a writer become famous. But it was while he still lived, and during his slow progress towards a death that he had not yet reached that this writer was able to watch the progress of his works towards Renown. A dead writer can at least be illustrious without any strain on himself. The effulgence of his name is stopped short by the stone upon his grave. In the deafness of the eternal sleep he is not importuned by Glory. But for Bergotte the antithesis was still incomplete. He existed still sufficiently to suffer from the tumult. He was moving still, though with difficulty, while his books, bounding about him, like daughters whom one loves but whose impetuous youthfulness and noisy pleasures tire one, brought day after day, to his very bedside, a crowd of fresh admirers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The visits which he now began to pay us came for me several years too late, for I had no longer the same admiration for him as of old. Which is not in any sense incompatible with the growth of his reputation. A man\u2019s work seldom becomes completely understood and successful before that of another writer, still obscure, has begun in the minds of certain people more difficult to please to substitute a fresh cult for one that has almost ceased to command observance. In the books of Bergotte which I constantly reread, his sentences stood out as clearly before my eyes as my own thoughts the furniture in my room and the carriages in the street. All the details were quite easily seen, not perhaps precisely as one had always seen them but at any rate as one was accustomed to see them now. But a new writer had recently begun to publish work in which the relations between things were so different from those that connected them for me that I could understand hardly anything of what he wrote. He would say, for instance: \u201cThe hose-pipes admired the smart upkeep of the roads\u201d (and so far it was simple, I followed him smoothly along those roads) \u201cwhich started every five minutes from Briand and Claudel.\u201d At that point I ceased to understand, because I had expected the name of a place and was given that of a person instead. Only I felt that it was not the sentence that was badly constructed but I myself that lacked the strength and ability necessary to reach the end. I would start afresh striving tooth and nail to climb to the pinnacle from which I would see things in their novel relations. And each time, after I had got about halfway through the sentence, I would fall back again, as later on, when I joined the Army, in my attempts at the exercise known as the \u2018bridge-ladder.\u2019 I felt nevertheless for the new writer the admiration which an awkward boy who never receives any marks for gymnastics feels when he watches another more nimble. And from then onwards I felt less admiration for Bergotte, whose limpidity began to strike me as insufficient. There was a time at which people recognised things quite easily in pictures when it was Fromentin who had painted them, and could not recognise them at all when it was Renoir\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People of taste and refinement tell us nowadays that Renoir is one of the great painters of the last century. But in so saying they forget the element of Time, and that it took a great deal of time, well into the present century, before Renoir was hailed as a great artist. To succeed thus in gaining recognition, the original painter, the original writer proceeds on the lines adopted by oculists. The course of treatment they give us by their painting or by their prose is not always agreeable to us. When it is at an end the operator says to us: \u201cNow look!\u201d And, lo and behold, the world around us (which was not created once and for all, but is created afresh as often as an original artist is born) appears to us entirely different from the; old world, but perfectly clear. Women pass in the street, different from what they used to be, because they are Renoirs, those Renoir types which we persistently refused to see as women. The carriages, too, are Renoirs, and the water, and the sky: we feel tempted to go for a walk in the forest which reminds us of that other which when we first saw it looked like anything in the world except a forest, like for instance a tapestry of innumerable shades but lacking precisely the shades proper to forests. Such is the new and perishable universe which has just been created. It will last until the next geological catastrophe is precipitated by a new painter or writer of original talent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This writer who had taken Bergotte\u2019s place in my affections wearied me not by the incoherence but by the novelty of associations \u2014 perfectly coherent \u2014 which my mind was not trained to follow. The fact that it was always at the same point that I felt myself relinquish my grasp pointed to a common character in the efforts that I had always to make. Moreover, when once in a thousand times I did succeed in following the writer to the end of his sentence, what I saw there was always of a humour, a truth, a charm similar to those which I had found long ago in reading Bergotte, only more delightful. I reflected that it was not so many years since a similar reconstruction of the world, like that which I was waiting now for his successor to produce, had been wrought for me by Bergotte himself. Until I was led to ask myself whether there was indeed any truth in the distinction which we are always making between art, which is no more advanced now than in Homer\u2019s day, and science with its continuous progress. Perhaps, on the contrary, art was in this respect like science; each new writer seemed to me to have advanced beyond the stage of his immediate predecessor; and how was I to know that in twenty years\u2019 time, when I should be able to accompany without strain or effort the newcomer of to-day, another might not appear at whose approach he in turn would be packed off to the limbo to which his own coming would have consigned Bergotte?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I spoke to the latter of the new writer. He gave me a distaste for him not so much when he said that his art was uncouth, easy and vacuous, as when he told me that he had seen him, and had almost mistaken him (so strong was the likeness) for Bloch. From that moment my friend\u2019s features outlined themselves on the printed pages, and I no longer felt any obligation to make the effort necessary to understand them. If Bergotte had decried him to me it was less, I fancy, out of jealousy for a success that was yet to come than out of ignorance of his work. He read scarcely anything. The bulk of his thought had long since passed from his brain into his books. He had grown thin, as though they had been extracted from him by surgical operations. His reproductive instinct no longer impelled him to any activity, now that he had given an independent existence to almost all his thoughts. He led the vegetative life of a convalescent, of a woman after childbirth; his fine eyes remained motionless, vaguely dazed, like the eyes of a man who lies on the seashore and in a vague daydream sees only each little breaking wave. However, if it was less interesting to talk to him now than I should once have found it, I felt no compunction for that. He was so far a creature of habit that the simplest habits, like the most elaborate, once he had formed them, became indispensable to him for a certain length of time. I do not know what made him come to our house first of all, but after that every day it was simply because he had been there the day before. He would come to the house as he might have gone to a caf\u00e9, so that no one should talk to him, so that he might \u2014 very rarely \u2014 talk himself; one might in short have found in his conduct a sign that he was moved to sympathise with us in our anxiety, or that he enjoyed my company, had one sought to draw any conclusion from such an assiduity in calling. It did not fail to impress my mother, sensitive to everything that might be regarded as an act of homage to her invalid. And every day she reminded me: \u201cSee that you don\u2019t forget to thank him nicely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We had also \u2014 a discreet feminine attention like the refreshments that are brought to us in the studio, between sittings, by a painter\u2019s mistress \u2014 a courteous supplement to those which her husband paid us professionally, a visit from Mme. Cottard. She came to offer us her \u2018waiting-woman,\u2019 or, if we preferred the services of a man, she would \u2018scour the country\u2019 for one, and, best of all, on our declining, said that she did hope this was not just a \u2018put-off on our part, a word which in her world signifies a false pretext for not accepting an invitation. She assured us that the Professor, who never referred to his patients when he was at home, was as sad about it as if it had been she herself who was ill. We shall see in due course that even if this had been true it would have been at once a very small and a considerable admission on the part of the most faithless and the most attentive of husbands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Offers as helpful and infinitely more touching owing to the form in which they were couched (which was a blend of the highest intelligence, the warmest sympathy, and a rare felicity of expression) were addressed to me by the Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg. I had met him at Balbec where he had come on a visit to one of his aunts, the Princesse de Luxembourg, being himself at that time merely Comte de Nassau. He had married, some months later, the charming daughter of another Luxembourg Princess, extremely rich, because she was the only daughter of a Prince who was the proprietor of an immense flour-mill. Whereupon the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, who had no children of his own and was devoted to his nephew Nassau, had obtained the approval of his Chamber to his declaring the young man his heir. As with all marriages of this nature, the origin of the bride\u2019s fortune was the obstacle as it was also the deciding factor. I remembered this Comte de Nassau as one of the most striking young men I had ever met, already devoured, at that time, by a dark and blazing passion for his betrothed. I was deeply touched by the letters which he wrote me, day after day, during my grandmother\u2019s illness, and Mamma herself, in her emotion, quoted sadly one of her mother\u2019s expressions: \u201cS\u00e9vign\u00e9 would not have put it better.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the sixth day Mamma, yielding to my grandmother\u2019s entreaties, left her for a little and pretended to go and lie down. I should have liked (so that my grandmother might go to sleep) Fran\u00e7oise to sit quite still and not disturb her by moving. In spite of my supplications, she got up and left the room; she was genuinely devoted to my grandmother; with her uncanny insight and her natural pessimism she regarded her as doomed. She would therefore have liked to pay her every possible attention. But word had just come that an electrician was in the house, one of the oldest servants of his firm, the head of which was his brother-in-law, highly esteemed throughout the building, where he had worked for many years, and especially by Jupien. This man had been ordered to come before my grandmother\u2019s illness. It seemed to me that he might have been sent away again, or told to wait. But Franchise\u2019s code of manners would not permit of this; it would have been a want of courtesy towards this worthy man; my grandmother\u2019s condition ceased at once to matter. When, after waiting a quarter of an hour, I lost my patience and went to look for her in the kitchen, I found her talking to him on the landing of the back staircase, the door of which stood open, a device which had the advantage, should any of us come on the scene, of letting it be thought that they were just saying goodbye, but had also the drawback of sending a terrible draught through the house. Fran\u00e7oise tore herself from the workman, not without turning to shout down after him various greetings, forgotten in her haste, to his wife and brother-in-law. A typical Combray scruple, not to be found wanting in politeness, which Fran\u00e7oise extended even to foreign politics. People foolishly imagine that the vast dimensions of social phenomena afford them an excellent opportunity to penetrate farther into the human soul; they ought, on the contrary, to realise that it is by plumbing the depths of a single personality that they might have a chance of understanding those phenomena. A thousand times over Fran\u00e7oise told the gardener at Combray that war was the most senseless of crimes, that life was the only thing that mattered. Yet, when the Russo-Japanese war broke out, she was quite ashamed, when she thought of the Tsar, that we had not gone to war also to help the \u2018poor Russians,\u2019 \u201csince,\u201d she reminded us, \u201cwe\u2019re allianced to them.\u201d She felt this abstention to be not quite polite to Nicholas II, who had always \u201csaid such nice things about us\u201d; it was a corollary of the same code which would have prevented her from refusing a glass of brandy from Jupien, knowing that it would \u2018upset\u2019 her digestion, and which brought it about that now, with my grandmother lying at death\u2019s door, the same meanness of which she considered France guilty in remaining neutral with regard to Japan she would have had to admit in herself, had she not gone in person to make her apologies to this good electrician who had been put to so much trouble\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Luckily for ourselves, we were soon rid of Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s daughter, who was obliged to be away for some weeks. To the regular stock of advice which people at Combray gave to the family of an invalid: \u201cYou haven\u2019t tried taking him away for a little . . . the change of air, you know . . . pick up an appetite . . . etc?\u201d she had added the almost unique idea, which she had specially created in her own imagination, and repeated accordingly whenever we saw her, without fail, as though hoping by dint of reiteration to force it through the thickness of people\u2019s heads: \u201cShe ought to have taken herself in hand radically from the first.\u201d She did not recommend any one cure rather than another, provided that it were \u2018radical.\u2019 As for Fran\u00e7oise herself, she noticed that we were not giving my grandmother many medicines. Since, according to her, they only destroyed the stomach, she was quite glad of this, but at the same time even more humiliated. She had, in the South of France, some cousins \u2014 relatively well-to-do \u2014 whose daughter, after falling ill just as she was growing up, had died at twenty-three; for several years the father and mother had ruined themselves on drugs, on different doctors, on pilgrimages from one watering-place to another, until her decease. Now all this seemed to Fran\u00e7oise, for the parents in question, a kind of luxury, as though they had owned racehorses, or a Place in the country. They themselves, in the midst of their affliction, derived a certain gratification from the thought of such lavish expenditure. They had now nothing left, least of all their most precious possession, their child, but they did enjoy telling people how they had done as much for her and more than the richest in the land. The ultra-violet rays to the action of which, several times a day for months on end, the poor girl had been subjected, delighted them more than anything. The father, elated in his grief by the glory of it all, was led to speak of his daughter at times as of an operatic star for whose sake he had ruined himself. Fran\u00e7oise was not unmoved by this wealth of scenic effect; that which framed my grandmother\u2019s sickbed seemed to her a trifle meagre, suited rather to an illness on the stage of a small provincial theatre\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There came a time when her uraemic trouble affected my grandmother\u2019s eyes. For some days she could not see at all. Her eyes were not at all like those of a blind person, but remained just the same as before. And I gathered that she could see nothing only from the strangeness of a certain smile of welcome which she assumed the moment one opened the door, until one had come up to her and taken her hand, a smile which began too soon and remained stereotyped on her lips, fixed, but always full-faced, and endeavouring to be visible from all points, because she could no longer rely upon her sight to regulate it, to indicate the right moment, the proper direction, to bring it to the point, to make it vary according to the change of position or of facial expression of the person who had come in; because it was left isolated, without the accompanying smile in her eyes which would have distracted a little from it the attention of the visitor, it assumed in its awkwardness an undue importance, giving one the impression of an exaggerated friendliness. Then her sight was completely restored; from her eyes the wandering affliction passed to her ears. For several days my grandmother was deaf. And as she was afraid of being taken by surprise by the sudden entry of some one whom she would not have heard come in, all day long, albeit she was lying with her face to the wall, she kept turning her head sharply towards the door. But the movement of her neck was clumsy, for one cannot adapt oneself in a few days to this transposition of faculties, so as, if not actually to see sounds, to listen with one\u2019s eyes. Finally her pain grew less, but the impediment of her speech increased. We were obliged to ask her to repeat almost everything that she said\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now my grandmother, realising that we could no longer understand her, gave up altogether the attempt to speak and lay perfectly still. When she caught sight of me she gave a sort of convulsive start like a person who suddenly finds himself unable to breathe, but could make no intelligible sound. Then, overcome by her sheer powerlessness, she let her head drop on to the pillows, stretched herself out flat in her bed, her face grave, like a face of marble, her hands motionless on the sheet or occupied in some purely physical action such as that of wiping her fingers with her handkerchief. She made no effort to think. Then came a state of perpetual agitation. She was incessantly trying to get up. But we restrained her so far as we could from doing so, for fear of her discovering how paralysed she was. One day when she had been left alone for a moment I found her standing on the floor in her nightgown trying to open the window\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Balbec, once, when a widow who had jumped into the sea had been rescued against her will, my grandmother had told me (moved perhaps by one of those presentiments which we discern at times in the mystery \u2014 so obscure, for all that \u2014 of the organic life around us, in which nevertheless it seems that our own future is foreshadowed) that she could think of nothing so cruel as to tear a poor wretch from the death that she had deliberately sought and restore her to her living martyrdom\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were just in time to catch my grandmother, she put up an almost violent resistance to my mother, then, overpowered, seated forcibly in an armchair, she ceased to wish for death, to regret being alive, her face resumed its impassivity and she began laboriously to pick off the hairs that had been left on her nightgown by a fur cloak which somebody had thrown over her shoulders\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The look in her eyes changed completely; often uneasy, plaintive, haggard, it was no longer the look we knew, it was the sullen expression of a doddering old woman. . . \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By dint of repeatedly asking her whether she would not like her hair done, Fran\u00e7oise managed to persuade herself that the request had come from my grandmother. She armed herself with brushes, combs, eau de Cologne, a wrapper. \u201cIt can\u2019t hurt Madame Am\u00e9d\u00e9e,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cif I just comb her; nobody\u2019s ever too ill for a good combing.\u201d In other words, one was never too weak for another person to be able, for her own satisfaction, to comb one. But when I came into the room I saw between the cruel hands of Fran\u00e7oise, as blissfully happy as though she were in the act of restoring my grandmother to health, beneath a thin rain of aged tresses which had not the strength to resist the action of the comb, a head which, incapable of maintaining the position into which it had been forced, was rolling to and fro with a ceaseless swirling motion in which sheer debility alternated with spasms of pain. I felt that the moment at which Fran\u00e7oise would have finished her task was approaching, and I dared not hasten it by suggesting to her: \u201cThat is enough,\u201d for fear of her disobeying me. But I did forcibly intervene when, in order that my grandmother might see whether her hair had been done to her liking, Fran\u00e7oise, with innocent savagery, brought her a glass. I was glad for the moment that I had managed to snatch it from her in time, before my grandmother, whom we had carefully kept without a mirror, could catch even a stray glimpse of a face unlike anything she could have imagined. But, alas, when, a moment later, I leaned over her to kiss that dear forehead which had been so harshly treated, she looked up at me with a puzzled, distrustful, shocked expression: she did not know me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to our doctor, this was a symptom that the congestion of her brain was increasing. It must be relieved in some way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cottard was in two minds. Fran\u00e7oise hoped at first that they were going to apply \u2018clarified cups.\u2019 She looked for the effects of this treatment in my dictionary, but could find no reference to it. Even if she had said \u2018scarified\u2019 instead of \u2018clarified\u2019 she still would not have found any reference to this adjective, since she did not look any more for it under \u2018S\u2019 than under \u2018C\u2019; she did indeed say \u2018clarified\u2019 but she wrote (and consequently assumed that the printed word was) \u2018esclarified.\u2019 Cottard, to her disappointment, gave the preference, though without much hope, to leeches. When, a few hours later, I went into my grandmother\u2019s room, fastened to her neck, her temples, her ears, the tiny black serpents were writhing among her bloodstained locks, as on the head of Medusa. But in her pale and peaceful entirely motionless face I saw wide open, luminous and calm, her own beautiful eyes, as in days gone by (perhaps even more charged with the light of intelligence than they had been before her illness, since, as she could not speak and must not move, it was to her eyes alone that she entrusted her thought, that thought which at one time occupies an immense place in us, offering us undreamed-of treasures, at another time seems reduced to nothing, then may be reborn, as though by spontaneous generation, by the withdrawal of a few drops of blood), her eyes, soft and liquid like two pools of oil in which the rekindled fire that was now burning lighted before the face of the invalid a reconquered universe. Her calm was no longer the wisdom of despair, but that of hope. She realised that she was better, wished to be careful, not to move, and made me the present only of a charming smile so that I should know that she was feeling better, as she gently pressed my hand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I knew the disgust that my grandmother felt at the sight of certain animals, let alone being touched by them. I knew that it was in consideration of a higher utility that she was enduring the leeches. And so it infuriated me to hear Fran\u00e7oise repeating to her with that laugh which people use to a baby, to make it crow: \u201cOh, look at the little beasties running about on Madame.\u201d This was, moreover, treating our patient with a want of respect, as though she were in her second childhood. But my grandmother, whose face had assumed the calm fortitude of a stoic, did not seem even to hear her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas! No sooner had the leeches been taken off than the congestion returned and grew steadily worse. I was surprised to find that at this stage, when my grandmother was so ill, Fran\u00e7oise was constantly disappearing. The fact was that she had ordered herself a mourning dress, and did not wish to keep her dressmaker waiting. In the lives of most women, everything, even the greatest sorrow, resolves itself into a question of \u2018trying-on.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few days later, when I was in bed and sleeping, my mother came to call me in the early hours of the morning. With that tender consideration which, in great crises, people who are crushed by grief shew even for the slightest discomfort of others:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cForgive me for disturbing your sleep,\u201d she said to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was not asleep,\u201d I answered as I awoke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I said this in good faith. The great modification which the act of awakening effects in us is not so much that of introducing us to the clear life of consciousness, as that of making us lose all memory of that other, rather more diffused light in which our mind has been resting, as in the opaline depths of the sea. The tide of thought, half veiled from our perception, over which we were drifting still a moment ago, kept us in a state of motion perfectly sufficient to enable us to refer to it by the name of wakefulness. But then our actual awakenings produce an interruption of memory. A little later we describe these states as sleep because we no longer remember them. And when shines that bright star which at the moment of waking illuminates behind the sleeper the whole expanse of his sleep, it makes him imagine for a few moments that this was not a sleeping but a waking state; a shooting star, it must be added, which blots out with the fading of its light not only the false existence but the very appearance of our dream, and merely enables him who has awoken to say to himself: \u201cI was asleep.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a voice so gentle that she seemed to be afraid of hurting me, my mother asked whether it would tire me too much to get out of bed, and, stroking my hands, went on:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy poor boy, you have only your Papa and Mamma to help you now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We went into the sickroom. Bent in a semicircle on the bed a creature other than my grandmother, a sort of wild beast which was coated with her hair and couched amid her bedclothes lay panting, groaning, making the blankets heave with its convulsions. The eyelids were closed, and it was because the one nearer me did not shut properly, rather than because it opened at all that it left visible a chink of eye, misty, filmed, reflecting the dimness both of an organic sense of vision and of a hidden, internal pain. All this agitation was not addressed to us, whom she neither saw nor knew. But if this was only a beast that was stirring there, where coulel my grandmother be? Yes, I could recognise the shape of her nose, which bore no relation now to the rest of her face, but to the corner of which a beauty spot still adhered, and the hand that kept thrusting the blankets aside with a gesture which formerly would have meant that those blankets were pressing upon her, but now meant nothing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mamma asked me to go for a little vinegar and water with which to sponge my grandmother\u2019s forehead. It was the only thing that refreshed her, thought Mamma, who saw that she was trying to push back her hair. But now one of the servants was signalling to me from the doorway. The news that my grandmother was in the last throes had spread like wildfire through the house. One of those \u2018extra helps\u2019 whom people engage at exceptional times to relieve the strain on their servants (a practice which gives deathbeds an air of being social functions) had just opened the front door to the Duc de Guermantes, who was now waiting in the hall and had asked for me: I could not escape him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have just, my dear Sir, heard your tragic news. I should like, as a mark of sympathy, to shake hands with your father.\u201d I made the excuse that I could not very well disturb him at the moment. M. de Guermantes was like a caller who turns up just as one is about to start on a journey. But he felt so intensely the importance of the courtesy he was shewing us that it blinded him to all else, and he insisted upon being taken into the drawing-room. As a general rule, he made a point of going resolutely through the formalities with which he had decided to honour anyone, and took little heed that the trunks were packed or the coffin ready\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you sent for Dieulafoy? No? That was a great mistake. And if you had only asked me, I would have got him to come, he never refuses me anything, although he has refused the Duchesse de Chartres before now. You see, I set myself above a Princess of the Blood. However, in the presence of death we are all equal,\u201d he added, not that he meant to suggest that my grandmother was becoming his equal, but probably because he felt that a prolonged discussion of his power over Dieulafoy and his pre-eminence over the Duchesse de Chartres would not be in very good taste\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This advice did not in the least surprise me. I knew that, in the Guermantes set, the name of Dieulafoy was regularly quoted (only with slightly more respect) among those of other tradesmen who were \u2018quite the best\u2019 in their respective lines. And the old Duchesse de Mortemart n\u00e9eGuermantes (I never could understand, by the way, why, the moment one speaks of a Duchess, one almost invariably says: \u201cThe old Duchess of So-and-so\u201d or, alternatively, in a delicate Watteau tone, if she is still young: \u201cThe little Duchess of So-and-so,\u201d) would prescribe almost automatically, with a droop of the eyelid, in serious cases: \u201cDieulafoy, Dieulafoy!\u201d as, if one wanted a place for ices, she would advise: \u2018Poir\u00e9 Blanche,\u2019 or for small pastry \u2018Rebattet, Rebattet.\u2019 But I was not aware that my father had, as a matter of fact, just sent for Dieulafoy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point my mother, who was waiting impatiently for some cylinders of oxygen which would help my grandmother to breathe more easily, came out herself to the hall where she little expected to find M. de Guermantes. I should have liked to conceal him, had that been possible. But convinced in his own mind that nothing was more essential, could be more gratifying to her or more indispensable to the maintenance of his reputation as a perfect gentleman, he seized me violently by the arm and, although I defended myself as against an assault with repeated protestations of \u201cSir, Sir, Sir,\u201d dragged me across to Mamma, saying: \u201cWill you do me the great honour of presenting me to your mother?\u201d letting go a little as he came to the last word. And it was so plain to him that the honour was hers that he could not help smiling at her even while he was composing a grave face. There was nothing for it but to mention his name, the sound of which at once started him bowing and scraping, and he was just going to begin the complete ritual of salutation. He apparently proposed to enter into conversation, but my mother, overwhelmed by her grief, told me to come at once and did not reply to the speeches of M. de Guermantes who, expecting to be received as a visitor and finding himself instead left alone in the hall, would have been obliged to retire had he not at that moment caught sight of Saint-Loup who had arrived in Paris that morning and had come to us in haste to inquire for news. \u201cI say, this is a piece of luck!\u201d cried the Duke joyfully, catching his nephew by the sleeve, which he nearly tore off, regardless of the presence of my mother who was again crossing the hall. Saint-Loup was not sorry, I fancy, despite his genuine sympathy, at having missed seeing me, considering his attitude towards myself. He left the house, carried off by his uncle who \u2014 having had something very important to say to him and having very nearly gone down to Donci\u00e8res on purpose to say it, was beside himself with joy at being able to save himself so much exertion. \u201cUpon my soul, if anybody had told me I had only to cross the courtyard and I should find you here, I should have thought it a huge joke; as your friend M. Bloch would say, it\u2019s a regular farce.\u201d And as he disappeared down the stairs with Robert whom he held by the shoulder: \u201cAll the same,\u201d he went on, \u201cit\u2019s quite clear I must have touched the hangman\u2019s rope or something; I do have the most astounding luck.\u201d Not that the Duc de Guermantes was ill-bred; far from it. But he was one of those men who are incapable of putting themselves in the place of other people, who resemble in that respect undertakers and the majority of doctors, and who, after composing their faces and saying: \u201cThis is a very painful occasion,\u201d after, if need be, embracing you and advising you to rest, cease to regard a deathbed or a funeral as anything but a social gathering of a more or less restricted kind at which, with a joviality that has been checked for a moment only, they scan the room in search of the person whom they can tell about their own little affairs, or ask to introduce them to some one else, or offer a \u2018lift\u2019 in their carriage when it is time to go home. The Duc de Guermantes, while congratulating himself on the \u2018good wind\u2019 that had blown him into the arms of his nephew, was still so surprised at the reception \u2014 natural as it was \u2014 that had been given him by my mother, that he declared later on that she was as disagreeable as my father was civil, that she had \u2018absent fits\u2019 during which she seemed literally not to hear a word you said to her, and that in his opinion she had no self-possession and perhaps even was not quite \u2018all there.\u2019 At the same time he had been quite prepared (according to what I was told) to put this state of mind down, in part at any rate, to the circumstances, and declared that my mother had seemed to him greatly \u2018affected\u2019 by the sad event. But he had still stored up in his limbs all the residue of bows and reverences which he had been prevented from using up, and had so little idea of the real nature of Mamma\u2019s sorrow that he asked me, the day before the funeral, if I was not doing anything to distract her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A half-brother of my grandmother, who was in religion, and whom I had never seen, had telegraphed to Austria, where the head of his Order was, and having as a special privilege obtained leave, arrived that day. Bowed down with grief, he sat by the bedside reading prayers and meditations from a book, without, however, taking his gimlet eyes from the invalid\u2019s face. At one point, when my grandmother was unconscious, the sight of this cleric\u2019s grief began to upset me, and I looked at him tenderly. He appeared surprised by my pity, and then an odd thing happened. He joined his hands in front of his face, like a man absorbed in painful meditation, but, on the assumption that I would then cease to watch him, left, as I observed, a tiny chink between his fingers. And at the moment when my gaze left his face, I saw his sharp eye, which had been making use of its vantage-point behind his hands to observe whether my sympathy were sincere. He was hidden there as in the darkness of a confessional. He saw that I was still looking and at once shut tight the lattice which he had left ajar. I have met him again since then, but never has any reference been made by either of us to that minute. It was tacitly agreed that I had not noticed that he was spying on me. In the priest as in the alienist, there is always an element of the examining magistrate. Besides, what friend is there, however cherished, in whose and our common past there has not been some such episode which we find it convenient to believe that he must have forgotten?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The doctor gave my grandmother an injection of morphine, and to make her breathing less troublesome ordered cylinders of oxygen. My mother, the doctor, the nursing sister held these in their hands; as soon as one was exhausted another was put in its place. I had left the room for a few minutes. When I returned I found myself face to face with a miracle. Accompanied on a muted instrument by an incessant murmur, my grandmother seemed to be greeting us with a long and blissful chant, which filled the room, rapid and musical. I soon realized that this was scarcely less unconscious, that it was as purely mechanical as the hoarse rattle that I had heard before leaving the room. Perhaps to a slight extent it reflected some improvement brought about by the morphine. Principally it was the result (the air not passing quite in the same way through the bronchial tubes) of a change in the register of her breathing. Released by the twofold action of the oxygen and the morphine, my grandmother\u2019s breath no longer laboured, panted, groaned, but, swift and light, shot like a skater along the delicious stream. Perhaps with her breath, unconscious like that of the wind in the hollow stem of a reed, there were blended in this chant some of those more human sighs which, liberated at the approach of death, make us imagine impressions of suffering or happiness in minds which already have ceased to feel, and these sighs came now to add a more melodious accent, but without changing its rhythm, to that long phrase which rose, mounted still higher, then declined, to start forth afresh, from her unburdened bosom in quest of the oxygen. Then, having risen to so high a pitch, having been sustained with so much vigour, the chant, mingled with a murmur of supplication from the midst of her ecstasy, seemed at times to stop altogether like a spring that has ceased to flow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise, in any great sorrow, felt the need but did not possess the art \u2014 as simple as that need was futile \u2014 of giving it expression. Regarding my grandmother\u2019s case as quite hopeless, it was her own personal impressions that she was impelled to communicate to us. And all that she could do was to repeat: \u201cIt makes me feel all queer,\u201d in the same tone in which she would say, when she had taken too large a plateful of cabbage broth: \u201cIt\u2019s like a load on my stomach,\u201d sensations both of which were more natural than she seemed to think. Though so feebly expressed, her grief was nevertheless very great, and was aggravated moreover by her annoyance that her daughter, detained at Combray (to which this young Parisian now referred as \u2018the Cambrousse\u2019 and where she felt herself growing \u2018p\u00e9trousse,\u2019 in other words fossilised), would not, presumably, be able to return in time for the funeral ceremony, which was certain, Fran\u00e7oise felt, to be a superb spectacle. Knowing that we were not inclined to be expansive, she made Jupien promise at all costs to keep every evening in the week free. She knew that he would be engaged elsewhere at the hour of the funeral. She was determined at least to \u2018go over it all\u2019 with him on his return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For several nights now my father, my grandfather and one of our cousins had been sitting up, and never left the house during the day. Their continuous devotion ended by assuming a mask of indifference, and their interminable leisure round the deathbed made them indulge in that small talk which is an inseparable accompaniment of prolonged confinement in a railway carriage. Anyhow this cousin (a nephew of my great-aunt) aroused in me an antipathy as strong as the esteem which he deserved and generally enjoyed. He was always \u2018sent for\u2019 in times of great trouble, and was so assiduous in his attentions to the dying that their mourning families, on the pretext that he was in delicate health, despite his robust appearance, his bass voice and bristling beard, invariably besought him, with the customary euphemisms, not to come to the cemetery. I could tell already that Mamma, who thought of others in the midst of the most crushing grief, would soon be saying to him, in a very different form of words, what he was in the habit of hearing said on all such occasions:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPromise me that you won\u2019t come \u2018to-morrow.\u2019 Please, for \u2018her sake.\u2019 At any rate, you won\u2019t go \u2018all the way.\u2019 It\u2019s what she would have wished.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there was nothing for it; he was always the first to arrive \u2018at the house,\u2019 by reason of which he had been given, among another set, the nickname (unknown to us) of \u2018No flowers by request.\u2019 And before attending everything he had always \u2018attended to everything,\u2019 which entitled him to the formula: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d came in a loud voice from my grandfather, who had grown rather deaf and had failed to catch something which our cousin had just said to my father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNothing,\u201d answered the cousin. \u201cI was just saying that I\u2019d heard from Combray this morning. The weather is appalling down there, and here we\u2019ve got too much sun.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYet the barometer is very low,\u201d put in my father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere did you say the weather was bad?\u201d asked my grandfather\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt Combray.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! I\u2019m not surprised; whenever it\u2019s bad here it\u2019s fine at Combray, and vice versa. Good gracious! Talking of Combray, has anyone remembered to tell Legrandin?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, don\u2019t worry about that, it\u2019s been done,\u201d said my cousin, whose cheeks, bronzed by an irrepressible growth of beard, dimpled faintly with the satisfaction of having \u2018remembered\u2019 it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point my father hurried from the room. I supposed that a sudden change, for better or worse, had occurred. It was simply that Dr. Dieulafoy had just arrived. My father went to receive him in the drawing-room, like the actor who is to come next on the stage. We had sent for him not to cure but to certify, in almost a legal capacity. Dr. Dieulafoy might indeed be a great physician, a marvellous professor; to these several parts, in which he excelled, he added a third, in which he remained for forty years without a rival, a part as original as that of the arguer, the scaramouch or the noble father, which consisted in coming to certify an agony or a death. The mere sound of his name foreshadowed the dignity with which he would sustain the part, and when the servant announced: \u201cM. Dieulafoy,\u201d one imagined oneself at a play by Moli\u00e8re. To the dignity of his attitude was added, without being conspicuous, the suppleness of a perfect figure. A face in itself too good-looking was toned down by the convention due to distressing circumstances. In the sable majesty of his frock coat the Professor entered the room, melancholy without affectation, uttered not the least word of condolence, which might have been thought insincere, nor was he guilty of the slightest infringement of the rules of tact. At the foot of a deathbed it was he and not the Duc de Guermantes who was the great gentleman Having examined my grandmother, but not so as to tire her, and with ari excess of reserve which was an act of courtesy to the doctor who was treating the case, he murmured a few words to my father, bowed respectfully to my mother to whom I felt that my father had positively to restrain himself from saying: \u201cProfessor Dieulafoy.\u201d But already our visitor had turned away, not wishing to seem to be soliciting an introduction, and left the room in the most polished manner conceivable, simply taking with him the sealed envelope that was slipped into his hand. He had not appeared to see it, and we ourselves were left wondering for a moment whether we had really given it to him, such a conjurer\u2019s nimbleness had he put into the act of making it vanish without thereby losing anything of the gravity \u2014 which was increased rather \u2014 of the great consultant in his long frock coat with its silken lapels, and his handsome head full of a noble commiseration. The slowness and vivacity of his movements shewed that, even if he had a hundred other visits to pay and patients waiting, he refused to appear hurried. For he was the embodiment of tact, intelligence and kindness. That eminent man is no longer with us. Other physicians, other professors may have rivalled, may indeed have surpassed him. But the \u2018capacity\u2019 in which his knowledge, his physical endowments, his distinguished manners made him triumph exists no longer for want of any successor capable of taking his place. Mamma had not even noticed M. Dieulafoy, everything that was not my grandmother having no existence for her. I remember (and here I anticipate) that at the cemetery, where we saw her, like a supernatural apparition, go up timidly to the grave and seem to be gazing in the wake of a flying form that was already far away, my father having remarked to her: \u201cOld Norpois came to the house and to the church and on here; he gave up a most important committee meeting to come; you ought really to say a word to him, he\u2019ll be so gratified if you do,\u201d my mother, when the Ambassador stood before her and bowed, could do no more than gently incline a face that shewed no tears. A couple of days earlier \u2014 to anticipate once again before returning to where we were just now by the bed on which my grandmother lay dying \u2014 while they were watching by the body, Fran\u00e7oise, who, not disbelieving entirely in ghosts, was terrified by the least sound, had said: \u201cI believe that\u2019s her.\u201d But in place of fear it was an ineffable sweetness that her words aroused in my mother, who would have been so glad that the dead should return, to have her mother with her sometimes still\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return now to those last hours, \u201cYou heard about the telegram her sisters sent us?\u201d my grandfather asked the cousin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, Beethoven, they told me about it, it\u2019s worth framing; still, I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy poor wife, who was so fond of them, too,\u201d said my grandfather, wiping away a tear. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t blame them. They\u2019re stark mad, both of them, as I\u2019ve always said. What\u2019s the matter now; aren\u2019t you going on with the oxygen?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother spoke: \u201cOh, but then Mamma will be having more trouble with her breathing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The doctor reassured her: \u201cOh, no! The effect of the oxygen will last a good while yet; we can begin it again presently.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to me that he would not have said this of a dying woman, that if this good effect were to last it meant that we could still do something to keep her alive. The hiss of the oxygen ceased for a few moments, But the happy plaint of her breathing poured out steadily, light, troubled, unfinished, without end, beginning afresh. Now and then it seemed that all was over, her breath stopped, whether owing to one of those transpositions to another octave that occur in the breathing of a sleeper, or else from a natural interruption, an effect of unconsciousness, the progress of asphyxia, some failure of the heart. The doctor stooped to feel my grandmother\u2019s pulse, but already, as if a tributary were pouring its current into the dried river-bed, a fresh chant broke out from the interrupted measure. And the first was resumed in another pitch with the same inexhaustible force. Who knows whether, without indeed my grandmother\u2019s being conscious of them, a countless throng of happy and tender memories compressed by suffering were not escaping from her now, like those lighter gases which had long been compressed in the cylinders? One would have said that everything thai she had to tell us was pouring out, that it was to us that she was addressing herself with this prolixity, this earnestness, this effusion. At the foot of the bed, convulsed by every gasp of this agony, not weeping but now and then drenched with tears, my mother presented the unreasoning desolation of a leaf which the rain lashes and the wind twirls on its stem. They made me dry my eyes before I went up to kiss my grandmother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I thought she couldn\u2019t see anything now?\u201d said my father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOne can never be sure,\u201d replied the doctor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When my lips touched her face, my grandmother\u2019s hands quivered, a long shudder ran through her whole body, reflex perhaps, perhaps because certain affections have their hyperaesthesia which recognises through the veil of unconsciousness what they barely need senses to enable them to love. Suddenly my grandmother half rose, made a violent effort, as though struggling to resist an attempt on her life. Fran\u00e7oise could not endure this sight and burst out sobbing. Remembering what the doctor had just said I tried to make her leave the room. At that moment my grandmother opened her eyes. I thrust myself hurriedly in front of Fran\u00e7oise to hide her tears, while my parents were speaking to the sufferer. The sound of the oxygen had ceased; the doctor moved away from the bedside. My grandmother was dead\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An hour or two later Fran\u00e7oise was able for the last time, and without causing them any pain, to comb those beautiful tresses which had only begun to turn grey and hitherto had seemed not so old as my grandmother herself. But now on the contrary it was they alone that set the crown of age on a face grown young again, from which had vanished the wrinkles, the contractions, the swellings, the strains, the hollows which in the long course of years had been carved on it by suffering. As at the far-off time when her parents had chosen for her a bridegroom, she had the features delicately traced by purity and submission, the cheeks glowing with a chaste expectation, with a vision of happiness, with an innocent gaiety even which the years had gradually destroyed.

like Mick Jagger said, I can't get no satisfaction\nThe girls are all around, but none of them wanna get with me\nMy threads are fresh and I'm lookin def, yo, what's up with L-O-C?\nThe girls is all jockin at the other end of the bar\nHavin drinks with some no-name chump, when they know that I'm the star\nSo I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina\nI asked the guy, \"Why you so fly?\" he said, \"Funky Cold Medina\"\nFunky Cold Medina\n\n[Verse 2]\nThis brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks\nPut a little Medina in your glass, and the girls'll come real quick\nIt's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac\nA couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap\nSo I gave some to my dog when he began to beg\nThen he licked his bowl and he looked at me and did the wild thing on my leg\nHe used to scratch and bite me, before he was much, much meaner\nBut now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina\n\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nI got every dog in my neighborhood breakin' down my door\nI got Spuds McKenzie\nAlex from Stroh's\nThey won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal\n\n[Verse 3]\nI went up to this girl, she said, \"Hi, my name is Sheena\"\nI thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky Cold Medina\nShe said, \"I'd like a drink,\" I said, \"Ehm, I'll go get it\"\nAnd then a couple sips she cold licked her lips, and I knew that she was with it\nSo I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned\nBut when she got undressed, it was a big old mess, Sheena was a man\nSo I threw him out, I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener\nYou must be sure that your girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina\nYou might also likeYou know what I'm sayin'?\nAin't no plans with a man\nThis is the 80's, and you know we get down with the ladies\nNo joke\n\nBreak it down\n\n[Verse 4]\nBack in the saddle, lookin' for a little affection\nI took a shot as a contestant on \"The Love Connection\"\nThe audience voted, and you know they picked a winner\nI took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner\nWe had a few drinks, I'm thinkin soon what I'll be gettin'\nInstead she started talkin 'bout plans for our wedding\nSo I grabbed my coat and hit the door\nI said, \"Baby, I'll be seein' ya\"\nThat's why I found you don't fool around with the Funky Cold Medina\n\nYou know what I'm sayin'?\nThat Medina's a monster\n\nFunky Cold Medina2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/886321", "artist_names": "Animotion", "full_title": "Room to Move

has its sugar and cream\nYour eggs are over-easy, your toast done lightly\nAll that's missing is your morning kiss that used to greet me\nNow you say the juice is sour, it used to be so sweet\nAnd I can't help but to wonder if you're talking 'bout me\nWe don't talk the way we used to talk, it\u2019s hurting so deep\nI\u2019ve got my pride, I will not cry\nBut it\u2019s making me weak\n[Chorus]\nI'm not your superwoman\nI'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay\nBoy, I am only human\nThis girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me\n\n(Ooh baby. Ay, yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI fought my way through the rush hour trying to make it home just for you\nI want to make sure that your dinner will be waiting for you\nBut when you get there you just tell me you\u2019re not hungry at all\nYou said you'd rather read the paper and you don't want to talk\nYou like to think that I\u2019m just crazy when I say that you've changed\nI\u2019m convinced I know the problem: you don't love me the same\nYou\u2019re just going through the motions and you\u2019re not being fair\nI've got my pride, I will not cry\nStill I can't help but care\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm not your superwoman, oh no no no\nI'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay\nBoy, I am only human (I'm only human)\nThis girl needs more than occasional hugs as a token of love from you to me\nI'm not your superwoman\nI'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay\nBoy, I am only human (I'm only human,

need just your love\nI'm not your superwoman\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm not your superwoman, oh no\nI'm not the kind of girl that you can let down and think that everything's okay\nBoy, I am only human (I'm

you ever again\nFrom this day on listen but no more\nPlease count me out, and you know what I'm talkin' about\nYou might also likeSmile for a while and let's be jolly\nLove shouldn't be so

spring love\nDamn she got me\nThis that new millennium spring love\nWith Stevie B the originator\nPitbull the innovator\nThis for all the spring breakers out there\nIn cancun, cabo, rosarito beach, daytona beach\nPanama city\nThis dedicated to ya'll(you know what it is)\nGo ahead and enjoy spring break, spring love\nStevie B holla at em\n[Stevie B:]\nI remember when we first started\nYou came to me and you were broken hearted\nI took you in and wiped all your tears away\nI gave you loving more than any other gave\nDon't you know I'm the one and I love you girl\nI don't care what they say you know you are my world\nCome back home to the one\nWho loves you more and more\nSoon you'll see that it was me you were searchin' for\nSpring love, come back to me\nSpring love, come back to me\nI need you and I want you baby\n[Pitbull:]\nI remember when I seen you in the club\nIn that dress in them heels\nYou was dressed to kill\nWith that? only got sex appeal\nI was feeling like I was on X fa real\nThose lips\nThose eyes\nThose hips\nThose thighs\nGot me hypnotized I'm sprung on spring love\nDamn she got me\n[Stevie B:]\nI can remember the first time we ever met\nThe sun was shining\nLove was gleaming in the air\nYou caught my eye and the next thing that I knew\nI was in love - I was so in love with you\nWe were so close for a season of my life\nI wanted so much to have you for my wife\nBut something changed\nSeason came to an end\nI had to leave you\nAnd that's where my heartache began\nSpring love, Come back to me\nSpring love, Come back to me\nI need you and I want you baby\n[Pitbull:]\nSo we finally met\nHad a couplpe of shots at the bar\nAnd from there we went (where?)\nTo the dance floor spring break spring love\nWe were sprung and that's fo damn sho\nIt's the last night\nSo you know that I'm feeling like a bass head\nWith a glass pipe\nWent back to the [ho]tel and beat it up\nDamn I'm sprung on spring love\nSpring love, Come back to me\nSpring love, Come

I'm here tomorrow\nAgain and again I've taken too much\nOf the things that cost you too much\n\n[Chorus]\nI used to think that the day would never come\nI'd see the light in the shade of the morning Sun\nMy morning sun is the drug that brings me near\nTo the childhood I lost, replaced by fear\nI used to think that the day would never come\nThat my life would depend on the morning Sun\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I was a very small boy\nVery small boys talked to me\nNow that we've grown up together\nThey're afraid of what they see\nThat's the price that we all pay\nAnd the value of destiny comes to nothing\nI can't tell you where we're going\nI guess there's just no way of knowing\n\n[Chorus]\nI used to think that the day would never come\nI'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun\nMy morning sun is the drug that brings me near\nTo the childhood I lost, replaced by fear\nI used to think that the day would never come\nThat my life would depend on the morning sun\u2026\n\n[Verse 3]\nI feel so extraordinary\nSomething's got a hold on me\nI get this feeling I'm in motion\nA certain sense of liberty\nThe chances are we've gone too far\nYou took my time and you took my money\nNow I fear you've left me standing\nIn a world that's so demanding\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI used to think that the day would never come\nI'd see the light in the shade of the morning sun\nMy

more and more\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\n(Nothing good comes easily)\nOoh, we've got to work it 'til we get it right\n(You see I love you so)\n(I'll never let you go) I'll never let you go\n(I wanna hug you) Oh

one simple fact\nWe both belong to someone else\nAs we slept the night away\n[Verse 2]\nIt's morning\nSunlight shines across your sleeping face\nA new day brings reality that\nWe must go our separate ways\n\nWhat a lovely night we had (yeah yeah)\nAs we shared each other's love\nWe forgot about all the pain we'd cause\nAs we slept the night away\n\n[Chorus]\nAs we lay\nWe forgot about tomorrow\nAs we lay (Mhm, hey hey)\nAs we lay\nWe didn't think about the price we'd have to pay\n(Oh no, no no no, no no no, no)\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's morning\nAnd now it's time for us to say goodbye\nGoodbye, baby\nYou're leaving me\nI know you got to hurry home to face your wife (Whoa-oh-oh)\nYou might also likeI would never want to hurt her, no\nShe would never understand\nYou belonged to me for just one night\nAs we slept the night away\n\n[Bridge]\nI would never, never want to hurt her, no no\nShe'd never understand\nYou belonged to me for just one night\nAs we slept the night away\n\n[Chorus]\nAs

lost\nIn the second\nIn the minute\nIn the hour\nHey hey, hey, as we lay\nWe forgot about tomorrow\nAs we lay\nIt's morning\n(It's morning)\nIt's morning\n(It's morning, ooh ooh)\nIt's morning\nIt's

the more you get burned\nBut that won't happen to us\n'Cause it's always been a matter of trust\n[Verse 2]\nI know you're an emotional girl\nIt took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world\nBut I can't offer you proof\nBut you're gonna face a moment of truth\nIt's hard when you're always afraid\nYou just recover when another belief is betrayed\nSo break my heart if you must\nIt's a matter of trust\n\n[Bridge]\nYou can't go the distance\nWith too much resistance\nI know you have doubts\nBut for God's sake, don't shut me out\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis time you've got nothing to lose\nYou can take it, you can leave it whatever you choose\nI won't hold back anything\nAnd I'll walk away a fool or a king\nSome love is just a lie of the mind\nIt's make believe until it's only a matter of time\nAnd some might have learned to adjust\nBut then it never was a matter of trust\nSee Billy Joel LiveGet tickets as low as $91You might also like[Bridge]\nI'm sure you're aware

big baseball player\nBack in high school\nHe could throw that speedball by you\nMake you look like a fool, boy\nSaw him the other night at this roadside bar\nI was walking in, he was walking out\nWe went back inside, sat down, had a few drinks\nBut all he kept talking about was\n[Chorus]\nGlory days, well they'll pass you by\nGlory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye\nGlory days, glory days\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, there's a girl that lives up the block\nBack in school, she could turn all the boys' heads\nSometimes on a Friday, I'll stop by and have a few drinks\nAfter she put her kids to bed\nHer and her husband, Bobby, well they split up\nI guess it's two years gone by now\nWe just sit around talking about the old times\nShe says when she feels like crying\nShe starts laughing, thinking 'bout\n\n[Chorus]\nGlory days, well they'll pass you by\nGlory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye\nGlory days, glory days\n\n[Missing Verse]\nMy old man worked twenty years on the line\nAnd they let him go\nNow everywhere he goes out looking for work\nThey just tell him that he's too old\nI was nine-years old and he was working\nAt the Metuchen Ford plant assembly line\nNow he just sits on a stool down at the Legion Hall\nBut I can tell what's on his mind\nSee Bruce Springsteen LiveGet tickets as low as $15You might also like[Missing Chorus]\nGlory days, yeah goin back\nGlory days, aw he ain't never had\nGlory days, glory days\n\n[Verse 3]\nI think I'm going down to the well tonight\nI'm gonna drink till I get my fill\nAnd I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it\nBut I probably will\nYeah, just sitting back, trying to recapture\nA little of the glory, yeah\nWell time slips away and leaves you with nothing, mister\nBut boring stories of\n\n[Chorus]\nGlory days, well they'll pass you by\nGlory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye\nGlory days, glory days3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path":
