So act like a hard rock, but I know who you been getting your bars off since\nSee, he was jealous I won my title back, so that's not a shocker\nBut for all that acting like you a writer, you should've got the Oscar\nSorry, ho\nThis gon' be the Maury show for this fraud impostor\n'Cause in the case of the three-year-old lines we traded, Daniel, you are NOT the author!\nYeah, that stripper line you got from Soul Khan!\nThat ain't one of your quotes!\nThat White House line was from a Jeff Ross comedy roast\nSquare cheese, Kraft...wait, is this some kind of practical joke?\nYou're telling me out of the couple lines we traded, there ain't a single one that you ACTUALLY WROTE!?\nTrue story\nBut you know what's even more creepy and more sad\nThis motherfucker had more ghostwriters than a Ouija board's had\nYou throwing stones from that glass house you a squeegee boy at\nAnd he enlisted all of y'all in the sabotage like this a Beastie Boys track!\nBut, yo, you could try to spread those lies, but you ain't exposing me, son-\nHold tight! I said, I seen your battle with Rone\nThey won't be giving this Jabroni no crown\nI could've crushed you on that card sponsored by OVO Sound\nDizaster lied and said you \"sold me whole rounds\"\nAnd you just bobbled your head, and ran with the bull like a rodeo clown!\nSo that's why I said you could try to tell those lies, but you ain't exposing me, son\nHe's had ghostwriters ever since the moment this phony begun\nWe could talk about every single battle that you supposedly won\nMatter of fact, since he likes to expose motherfuckers\nLet me show him how it's supposed to be done!\nYeah, check it out\nYour King of the Dot debut, you battled Q\nThey called it a body bag for you after\nYou told Q he's such a \"wannabe Asian battler, he probably hates Dizaster?\"\nYour whole first round was full of those Asian jokes that got a lot of great laughter\nBut we both know you got that ENTIRE ROUND from another Canadian rapper!\nWho?\nOh, say word you didn't get that whole verse from HFK!\n(*Caustic cracks up laughing*)\nNo? Oh! Oh! Oh, yes, you did!!!\nI got all the screenshots to prove it\nLemme address you, kid\nYeah, you even used bars in the Grand Prix that he blessed you with\nAlong with bars from 100 Bulletz and Charron!? What!?!\nI suggest you quit!\n'Cause when he battled Diz, he used Dirt's verses\nThat's why you stumbled half the time\nSo it's not just the fact you borrowed a couple raps of mine\nYou take from Fredo, Frank Stacks...shit, your brother Madness' lines\nA Caustic verse is just a collage of a bunch of other rappers' rhymes!\nAnd that's the truth!\nSo, after this landslide loss, you need to stand back or sit\n'Cause you can't write bars, and you can't rap for shit!\nEach one of my verses handcrafted, legit\nFor yours, you went to Dirtbag Dan's attic for band practice, and sandblasted some dick!\nBut, yo, yo, yo!\nIt's no wonder he's always begging for lines\nHe's a coke head and a dope user\nSo, congratulations on being a broke loser with no future\nYeah, he acts like it's all just some crazy rumor\nNo, no, that's time, that's time!\nNo, I can't give you more time\nBut this bitch been stealing jokes, that's lazy humor\nYou battle rap's Amy Schumer!\nYou kidding me? Reactions, though! Reactions!\nYou're over time, bro! You're over time!\nYo, yo, check this out!\nNo, this last few I gotta get out!\nGo ahead! Let him rap!\nWell, fuck it! Let him rap!\nLet him rap! Let him fucking rap!\nI don't care! LET HIM FUCKING RAP!\nYo, this shit's been a long time coming, man\nLet me talk!\nSo I said, yo, you took my coattails for a joyride, B\nNow, this is like Chef Ramsay cooking Italian versus Chef Boyardee\nI spark the burner, let all of all y'all see\nYou could wind up with your noodle all dented when I blow off steam\nYou wanna test my pen, eh?\nThis fool silly\nI'm making fresh dough\nI don't know who you think you battling, weenie\nYou just a pest, though\nThat's why you could never pass the bars with the best, ho\n'Cause everything you had for Chedda was all Fredo or all Fresco!\nThat's why y'all need to stop booking him!\nOr he needs to start depending on his friends less\nYou shouldn't even be able to get one plate, like your bench-press!\nYou a lame, Dan\nYou been using that same game plan for a while\nThat's why these Caustic fans are really just Arcane fans in denial!\nTime\n[Interlude: Arcane, Caustic + Organik]\nYou're a minute and a half over, bro\n'Kay, my bad, my bad! I gotta get these bars out\nThree minutes, we said, right? Three minutes, we said!\nAre you done, or are you finished?\nNo, three! The contract says three!\nAre you done, or you finished?\nAre you good?\n\n[Round 1: Caustic + Arcane]\nI SAID, YO!\nDude, you saying I got all those lines from all those people?\nThat's just fucking downright inconsiderate\nBut YOU'RE telling ME I didn't write NONE of the bars that you bought?\nDude, I don't know if that sounds bad on me, but you're a fucking idiot!\n(*chuckles*)\nYo, that's a nice sweatshirt, man!\nWhat is that, Ecko?\nNo? Let's check: \"Hello...hello...hello...\"\nI guess so\nArcane...that's a hard name\nWhat are y'all mad about? Mad you bought some bars, eh?\nRemember Bargate? Fucking dark days\nYou know how he got his first verse? Card game\nRunner runner flush: smooth move, Brigante!\nSo, I can tell right now that you're one of those guys that learns shit the hard way\nLook at him he's even trying to copy my beard\nYou don't even know who you are, 'Cane!\nYo, you got EXPOSED in front of Drake!\nYou brought our league shame\nI mean, God, you didn't even pay me for the Diz battle, bitch\nTechnically, that's OUR chain!\nYou WISH you wrote those bars! Liar!\nYo, I've been waiting a long time to break you down\nYou know what? Fuck a Bargate\nThese ones are on the house: you can take these rounds\nDude, you don't even have real homies!\nYou have to pay for pals\nYou helped me?\nBitch, you helped me about as much as Donald Trump helped Puerto Rico with those paper towels!\nSee, I'm way too clean, but compared to you, I'm a lot fresher\nBitch, you see me in the streets, you better tuck that shit in like a cross-dresser\nBitch, my bars are the only reason that you actually got Chedda\nIt was his hottest bars ever\nNo wonder they call them \"Arcane\"\nWhat? One day he magically got better?\nYo, you are a weak-ass spitter, and an even weaker performer\nBitch, you were way fuckin' better when you had me in your corner\nI've got bars in at least four battles that he's recorded\nBitch you dropped more money on those rounds than fuckin' Wheel Of Fortune!\nLook at this fuckin' idiot\nHe's gettin' mad, he's tryin' to discredit me\nAt this point, your best bet is just tryin' to share the legacy\nI feel like it's a game show sometimes, I gotta question the square next to me\nYou took eight bars for 200, Alex: your career was in jeopardy!\nYou see the left hand; a good look, shit'll catch you dead in the eye\nThis right hand? Wrote the best shit you ever said in your life\nYou have never been nice\nConsider this a lesson in life\nWhen you don't pay what you owe you gotta pay the Jefferson Price\nI hope you get booed like, \"Dude you suck! You little FUBU fuck!\"\nI swear to God if you throw one punch I'll fuckin' chew you up\nEverybody's just here to see if I swing on 'Cane like Scrooge McDuck!\nLook at how much attention our fuckin' rivalry brings\nLook, let's see how much fuckin' traction his little lies can achieve\nFuck a battle rap, this a casket match, this the shit y'all been dyin' to see\nCause we all know without The Undertaker, we would've never seen 'Cane have fire in the ring!\nOne\nYou might also like[Round 2: Arcane + Caustic]\nNice round, I wonder who wrote those bars though\nMy knee's outta place right now, yeah\nI said yo, this motherfucker should've been gettin' his bars up\nInstead he was gettin' his beard up\nWell now you fast food, I'll put that Big Mac to his beer gut\nHe at the barbershop like, \"I know this sounds weird but...\nGive me the System Of A Down syndrome beard and let's go with the Macklemore haircut.\"\nThe fuck is wrong with you son?\nAnd why do you try to talk like Sylvester Stallone?\nYou lost to Stevie P out west, I thought the west was your home\nShit, you even signed a girl's breast, I bet you was just in the zone\nBut you don't get points for that shit when the bitch got a chest like Charron\nLittle flat chested bitch\nYo, that girl wasn't even a 3, I'd give her maybe like a 2\nAnd that's the girl you went to the event with? That's your baby? That's your boo?\nNope\nShit you just love those ugly girls huh? I don't know how you date them like you do\nBut I guess your options are kinda limited when your face looks like a shoe\nMeanwhile I'm the face that team 'Ganik has been tryin' to recruit\nCause I've been nice in the booth since pinstripes and a suit\nHe'll see defeat when the cleats catch him at chin height with the boot\nAnd poke so many holes in his throat it'll turn his windpipe to a flute\nSee, he can't write bars like that\nSo I'm only doin' this battle cause I felt like I owed this to the fans\nIt would've happened sooner but this loser had a whole list of demands\nHe wanted to do the battle in Cali so he could have home spitter's advantage\nWith his whole clique in the stands and have it hosted by the Klan\nThat's when he phoned Bishop to rant, tryin' to go switch up the plans\nHe wanted a bowl of red M&M's and a gold tinted Sedan\nWith three Asian hookers in the back that used to pull tricks in Japan\nAnd he insisted on growing that stupid beard to look as homeless as he can\nAnd you told Marvin that his beard looked like the Wu-Tang logo\nShit, your beard look like you beggin' for loose change, hobo\nFunny now this dude's name is too lame, your views ain't promo\nI'm top of the food chain you look like you shop at the food bank bozo\nLet me tell you this, your last battle got like 3,000 views, your career's in limbo\nAin't nobody checkin' for you, you've been stale from the intro\nIf his people stay hatin' I'm like a real estate agent\nPost up on his front lawn and let four sail through his window\nHe don't write like that\nApparently they don't care\nThis fake Italian kept my name in his mouth for years and I know why you mention me\nCause you was never relevant til you tried to undermine my legacy\nI should let smoke rise from his chimney like the Pope just died in Italy\nYou lied religiously but I Romans are known for revising history\nThat was good\nCheck it out, this motherfucker tried to claim he was a ghost writer but that was all lies\nHe said Dizaster stole his laptop but that was all lies\nIt's like battle rap was stuck in a paradox since you told that pair of lies\nSo it's only right tonight you get stomped out with a pair of Dock's 'til you paralyzed\nSo, yo, I'm here to watch this pathological liar get trapped and caught in the fire\nI should take his fuckin' needle nose and snap it off with pliers\nHe's battle rap's Pinocchio: just look at the size of his nose\nI wouldn't be surprised if it grows for all the lies that he's told\nHe said he couldn't cross the border for a rap on a gun case\nRight, you ain't a shooter, I could wrap you in duct tape\nIt's like this meatball playin' street ball\nHe was duckin' travelin' upstate\nTried to pivot 'til we see how easy he can cross over\nWe know his pump fake\nSo yo, after this, stop lyin', stop snitchin', stop cryin', stop bitchin'\nStop pandering to these fans and vying for their attention\nYour spot as Battle Rap's Biggest Loser will be forever reserved\nAnd y'all fans can stop givin' him credit he never deserved\nCause after this I don't give a fuck if you starve in a ditch\nOut of all people it's funny you're the one that started this shit\nThen he gets called out for stealin' every bar that he spits\nI guess what goes around comes around, huh? Karma's a bitch!\n[Round 2: Caustic + Arcane]\nYo!\nWhatup Toronto y'all wit me?\nHello? Hello?\nYo, did you seriously just make fun of my fuckin' haircut? You little fuckin' shit stain\nHow you gonna make fun of anybody's haircut when you haven't taken your hat off since 5th grade?\nDude, look at you 'Cane\nYou look good dude\nGot a longer beard, bought some Caustic schemes\nYou're right on time, looks like you dressed up as your favorite rapper for Halloween\nWho wrote that bitch?\nFreestyle\nI said at the last event I was supposed to battle Bonnie, I was down for the scrap\nAt Battle Of The Sexes they offered 'Cane 40 B.A.R.R.S\nHe was like, \"Yeah...how much is that?\"\nYo, you were 33 when you battled Corey Charron\nThat was in 2010\nMy dude, you are confirmed: at least 40 years old\nYou're 40? You're 40\nNo\nYou're 40 years old\nStill tryin' to make it with music?\nI guess, at this age, gettin' a 30 dropped on you is a major improvement!\nSo 30 is the new 40, this kid is too corny, it's an instant vic-tory\nYou always makin' up lies, every week it's a different story\nIsn't it boring, bitch, you get animated, shit'll get gory\nI'm killin' this random fuckin' Pickle Rick Morty!!!\nSee, all those bars you spit for Chedda, that was shit I was never meant to sell\nAnd then, after Bargate came out, your little rap career got put up on the shelf\nI mean it makes sense, you had those IKEA bars\nEverything fell apart when you tried to put it together by yourself!\nOh, that's fire! What's wrong with y'all?\nOh my gawd, that's amazing!\nSo, go sit somewhere else, there ain't room at our table\nEverything happens for a reason, 'Cane\nYou know what the reason is? God hates you!\nI'm bringin' you back down to Earth\nI'll turn Arcane into archangel\nIf any of these fans bought that bullshit you sold 'em...surprise, they Arcane'd you\nYo, you can try to pull that shit on these casual-ass new jack fans\nAnd let these losers think you're Wolverine, when, truthfully, it's just a huge act, man\nIf you think all he bought was punchlines then shit will really fuck your head up\nCause check this out, Diz' was in on the shit the whole time bitch, the only thing you bought was a setup\nYo, you are fuckin' trash\nYou are fuckin' trash\nLook at your fuckin' life\nDude, I mean I was patient with him, waited for him to admit that it was blatant plagiarism\nBut instead he switched and played the victim and blamed all of y'all\nLike all of y'all put a gun to his head and made him pay for writtens\nThe fuck?\nActin' like I can't beat you\nAnd thanks to this contract and Organik, I'mma keep this rap peaceful\nBut the next time you decide to bite the hand that feeds you\nMake sure that it can't reach you\nBitch\n\n[Round 3: Arcane]\nI said yo, I could've predicted this clown was gonna start talkin' 'bout his hands early\nWell here's a free lesson; real bosses don't get they hands dirty\nI brought a room full of goons that's ready to stretch this man's jersey\nSo eat a dick you piece of shit I'm 'bout to fuckin' catch this damn 30\nI got your fate in my hands like I'm flippin' Tarot cards\nYou got flat lines I don't I don't hear no heart\nThey said, \"Watch it he spread gossip.\" I said, \"Let that weirdo prepare those parts\nHe needs gossip to compensate for havin' zero bars.\"\nI'm one of the great, I chop heads off and hung 'em on stakes\nIn that Grand Prix y'all seen me in one of my hungriest states\nAs far as Chedda, that was just somethin' I ate\nYou was starvin' watchin' me eat and you're lucky I tossed you a couple crumbs from my plate\nThen you battled Jefferson: what a fuckin' disgrace\nYou sold your soul for a priceless when Soul punched you in the face\nSo that's when I looked up his name in a thesaurus, and consider it luck\n\"Caustic\" is another word for \"bitter\", which makes sense 'cause you bitter as fuck!\nThat's why you doin' all this fuckin' extra shit tryin' to act more tough\nWell I brought a jackknife and a semi: that's a transport truck\nI'll park that Mac on his grill like a transport truck\nAnd if that don't kill him, the sixteen will like a transport truck\nC'mon man, y'all should've read the warning signs\n\"Caustic\" means \"slightly corrosive\"\nBut me? I write my best content under pressure, this material highly explosive\nNone of the bars he has are just poison and he just talks sick with his motives\nSo I came to mop the floor with Caustic make sure he gets properly disposed of\nSo I brought that rat poison cause he's the type to squeak and squeal\nAnd I brought my peoples to keep that steel if the beef gets real\nSo please just chill or this geek gets killed\nThis battle is about who's the better writer and this biter can't compete with skill\nSo if you wanna spar lyrically, you're no match for my artillery\nYour bars filler-y, I'm a killer with dark imagery\nGet scared physically\nIt's a violent story, your mining quarry better have the iron or be ready to start drillin' B\nI'm back ho\nYour lines aren't nothin' to get bowled over\nIf mine's bolder you get bowled over like a bull dozer\nGet it? Iron, ore, mines, boulder, back hoe, bulldozer\nStrip mine down into layers and y'all can see the gold closer\nI'm cookin'\nFor that chicken, I'mma spit like a slow roaster\nNo holster, the snub nose in the air, that's a cold shoulder\nI let one ring it rattle his cage like a goal poster\nHis wig get split and get pushed sideways like his combover\nAnd normally, I'm not the type to beef with critics\nI'm the type to burn your fuckin' house down to the ground with your family sleepin' in it\nThe last thing you'll see is me light the match to the kerosene and flick it\nTo be specific, if I take a trip out west it's not for scenic visit\nI'm focused player, you've been nothin' but smoke and mirrors your whole career, I'm so sincere\nYou don't got a leg to stand on, that's a broken chair\nWe don't compare\nYou was never even top 10, you on the lowest tier\nAnd I bet your buddies wrote more bars for this battle than you've wrote in years\nAnd when it comes to all your Fresh Coast pals, I've been known to roast your peers\nI took the chain from Dizaster and The Saurus when they were the most revered\nSo if the whole Fresh Coast writes for you then it's only fair\nFor that chain I'm on a lookout to keep in the 6ix, I just made sure his whole coast is clear\nMake some fuckin' noise y'all!\n\n[Round 3: Caustic]\nSo he said he's gonna kill my whole family\nThat's this dude keepin' it real wit me\nDude, with as many fuckin' verses as you've taken it makes sense you're from Steel City\nAye, do you guys remember when Drake was like actually at all these events?\nAnd you can see him in the crowd he's just fuckin' happy as it gets\nThere was no drama back then we were just rappin' with our friends\nThen you can see his face change as 'Cane gets exposed for being a massive piece of shit\nHe fuckin' grabbed his keys and dipped and we fuckin' haven't seen him since\nSo let's all congratulate him; Alex Drake, it's hip hop's known bitch\nBut don't feel bad kiddo at least you're not the only Drake in Canada that doesn't write his own shit\nIf he wants to dig up dirt me, he's just jealous cause I'm legendary\nIf I wanted to dig up dirt on him I'd walk to the cemetery where his mom and sister are buried\nOh my god, when it comes to this disrespect shit I swear to God I'm a visionary\nSo fuck your mother, bitch!\nYour mother puts the fuckin' \"bitch\" in \"obituary\"\nYo...this shit just got incredibly real\nLuckily for me, I don't fuckin' care how you feel\nBut we've been in this situation before, haven't we, Alex? So let's make a deal!\nI said you can try to sucker-punch, oh my God I'll fuck you up\nIf they dug your little sister up she wouldn't be the only thing that stiffened up\nOh, so what your mom died, Arcane? I don't give a fuck!\nYou want me to quit spittin' the rest of this round? That's an extra 500 bucks!\nI mean I don't know what else to say to you\nThey fuckin' died to get away from you!\nI wrote all your shit back in the day cause on your own you wasn't capable\nI mean let's face facts, half your fuckin' family died cause no one could relate to you\nI guess in the last five years not that much has changed for you\nI mean look at the fuckin' clothes that you've got on\nI mean you're so fuckin' underground Arcane, do you feel any closer to your mom?\nYo, this fuckin' idiot used to hit my inbox like, \"Yo Caustic look at all this shit I wrote for this bum.\"\nAnd I was like, \"No, no, no Alex...this is how it's supposed to be done.\"\nYo, this cat's been salty since before I got my title shot\nHis writing was shaky like Michael Fox, so he sent me paper like Michael Scott\nIt all makes sense why he needed so much assistance with his writer's block\nI guess when half your family's in a coffin, it's a little hard to think outside the box\nSo this is it for you my guy, this round right here is do or die\nIt's either you or I and I'm a sick piece of shit\nDude I'll commit suicide just to go to your fuckin' family in Hell and tell 'em you said \"hi\"\nI hope you find a condom in your next fuckin' bologna sandwich\nI hope you slip into a coma after you get diagnosed with melanoma and colon cancer\nI hope for the rest of your shitty-ass life, you open shows for local rappers\nI hope you can't take it one day, and you call a suicide hotline...and no one answers\nSo I did this round for all of y'all who thought homie was more than average\nI mean, it's five years after Bargate, and he's still trying to control the damage\nSo, no one here needs to feel bad for Little Orphan Alex\n'Cause I just lit this guy up like Aurora Borealis!\nTime, bitch!

LyricsIf you go away\nOn this summer day\nThen you might as well\nTake the sun away\nAll the birds that flew\nIn the summer sky\nWhen our love was new\nAnd our hearts were high\nAnd the day was young\nAnd the nights were long\nAnd the moon stood still\nFor the night bird's song\nIf you go away\nIf you go away\nIf you go away\nBut if you stay\nI'll make you a day\nLike no day has been\nOr will be again\nWe'll sail the sun\nWe'll ride on the rain\nWe'll talk to the trees\nWe'll fly with the wind\n\nBut if you go away\nWhen I love you so\nThere'll be nothing left\nIn the world, you know\nJust an empty room\nFull of empty space\nLike the empty look\nI see on your face\nIf you go away\nIf you go away\nIf you go away\n\nBut if you stay\nI'll make you a day\nLike no day has been\nOr will be again\nWe'll sail the sun\nWe'll ride on the rain\nWe'll talk to the trees\nWe'll fly with the wind\nYou might also likeBut if you go away\nIf you go away\nIf you go away1Embed"}, {"_type":

One of these is the sensibility -- unmistakably modern, a variant of sophistication but hardly identical with it -- that goes by the cult name of \"Camp.\"\n\nA sensibility (as distinct from an idea) is one of the hardest things to talk about; but there are special reasons why Camp, in particular, has never been discussed. It is not a natural mode of sensibility, if there be any such. Indeed the essence of Camp is its love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration. And Camp is esoteric -- something of a private code, a badge of identity even, among small urban cliques. Apart from a lazy two-page sketch in Christopher Isherwood's novel The World in the Evening (1954), it has hardly broken into print. To talk about Camp is therefore to betray it. If the betrayal can be defended, it will be for the edification it provides, or the dignity of the conflict it resolves. For myself, I plead the goal of self-edification, and the goad of a sharp conflict in my own sensibility. I am strongly drawn to Camp, and almost as strongly offended by it. That is why I want to talk about it, and why I can. For no one who wholeheartedly shares in a given sensibility can analyze it; he can only, whatever his intention, exhibit it. To name a sensibility, to draw its contours and to recount its history, requires a deep sympathy modified by revulsion.\n\nThough I am speaking about sensibility only -- and about a sensibility that, among other things, converts the serious into the frivolous -- these are grave matters. Most people think of sensibility or taste as the realm of purely subjective preferences, those mysterious attractions, mainly sensual, that have not been brought under the sovereignty of reason. They allow that considerations of taste play a part in their reactions to people and to works of art. But this attitude is na\u00efve. And even worse. To patronize the faculty of taste is to patronize oneself. For taste governs every free -- as opposed to rote -- human response. Nothing is more decisive. There is taste in people, visual taste, taste in emotion - and there is taste in acts, taste in morality. Intelligence, as well, is really a kind of taste: taste in ideas. (One of the facts to be reckoned with is that taste tends to develop very unevenly. It\u2019s rare that the same person has good visual taste and good taste in people and taste in ideas.)\n\nTaste has no system and no proofs. But there is something like a logic of taste: the consistent sensibility which underlies and gives rise to a certain taste. A sensibility is almost, but not quite, ineffable. Any sensibility which can be crammed into the mold of a system, or handled with the rough tools of proof, is no longer a sensibility at all. It has hardened into an idea . . .\n\nTo snare a sensibility in words, especially one that is alive and powerful,1 one must be tentative and nimble. The form of jottings, rather than an essay (with its claim to a linear, consecutive argument), seemed more appropriate for getting down something of this particular fugitive sensibility. It's embarrassing to be solemn and treatise-like about Camp. One runs the risk of having, oneself, produced a very inferior piece of Camp.\n\nThese notes are for Oscar Wilde.\n\"One should either be a work of art, or wear a work of art.\"\n- Phrases & Philosophies for the Use of the Young\n\n1. To start very generally: Camp is a certain mode of aestheticism. It is one way of seeing the world as an aesthetic phenomenon. That way, the way of Camp, is not in terms of beauty, but in terms of the degree of artifice, of stylization.\n\n2. To emphasize style is to slight content, or to introduce an attitude which is neutral with respect to content. It goes without saying that the Camp sensibility is disengaged, depoliticized -- or at least apolitical.\n\n3. Not only is there a Camp vision, a Camp way of looking at things. Camp is as well a quality discoverable in objects and the behavior of persons. There are \"campy\" movies, clothes, furniture, popular songs, novels, people, buildings. . . . This distinction is important. True, the Camp eye has the power to transform experience. But not everything can be seen as Camp. It's not all in the eye of the beholder.\n\n4. Random examples of items which are part of the canon of Camp:\n\nZuleika Dobson\nTiffany lamps\nScopitone films\nThe Brown Derby restaurant on Sunset Boulevard in LA\nThe Enquirer, headlines and stories\nAubrey Beardsley drawings\nSwan Lake\nBellini\u2019s operas\nVisconti's direction of Salome and 'Tis Pity She's a Whore\ncertain turn-of-the-century picture postcards\nSchoedsack's King Kong\nthe Cuban pop singer La Lupe\nLynn Ward's novel in woodcuts, God's Man\nthe old Flash Gordon comics\nwomen's clothes of the twenties (feather boas, fringed and beaded dresses, etc.)\nthe novels of Ronald Firbank and Ivy Compton-Burnett\nstag movies seen without lust\n5. Camp taste has an affinity for certain arts rather than others. Clothes, furniture, all the elements of visual d\u00e9cor, for instance, make up a large part of Camp. For Camp art is often decorative art, emphasizing texture, sensuous surface, and style at the expense of content. Concert music, though, because it is contentless, is rarely Camp. It offers no opportunity, say, for a contrast between silly or extravagant content and rich form. . . . Sometimes whole art forms become saturated with Camp. Classical ballet, opera, movies have seemed so for a long time. In the last two years, popular music (post rock-\u2019n\u2019-roll, what the French call y\u00e9 y\u00e9) has been annexed. And movie criticism (like lists of \"The 10 Best Bad Movies I Have Seen\") is probably the greatest popularizer of Camp taste today, because most people still go to the movies in a high-spirited and unpretentious way.\n\n6. There is a sense in which it is correct to say: \"It's too good to be Camp.\" Or \"too important,\" not marginal enough. (More on this later.) Thus, the personality and many of the works of Jean Cocteau are Camp, but not those of Andr\u00e9 Gide; the operas of Richard Strauss, but not those of Wagner; concoctions of Tin Pan Alley and Liverpool, but not jazz. Many examples of Camp are things which, from a \"serious\" point of view, are either bad art or kitsch. Not all, though. Not only is Camp not necessarily bad art, but some art which can be approached as Camp (example: the major films of Louis Feuillade) merits the most serious admiration and study.\n\n\"The more we study Art, the less we care for Nature.\"\n- The Decay of Lying\n\n7. All Camp objects, and persons, contain a large element of artifice. Nothing in nature can be campy . . . Rural Camp is still man-made, and most campy objects are urban. (Yet, they often have a serenity -- or a naivet\u00e9 -- which is the equivalent of pastoral. A great deal of Camp suggests Empson\u2019s phrase, \"urban pastoral.\")\n\n8. Camp is a vision of the world in terms of style -- but a particular kind of style. It is the love of the exaggerated, the \"off,\" of things-being-what-they-are-not. The best example is in Art Nouveau, the most typical and fully developed Camp style. Art Nouveau objects, typically, convert one thing into something else: the lighting fixtures in the form of flowering plants, the living room which is really a grotto. A remarkable example: the Paris M\u00e9tro entrances designed by Hector Guimard in the late 1890s in the shape of cast-iron orchid stalks.\n\n9. As a taste in persons, Camp responds particularly to the markedly attenuated and to the strongly exaggerated. The androgyne is certainly one of the great images of Camp sensibility. Examples: the swooning, slim, sinuous figures of pre-Raphaelite painting and poetry; the thin, flowing, sexless bodies in Art Nouveau prints and posters, presented in relief on lamps and ashtrays; the haunting androgynous vacancy behind the perfect beauty of Greta Garbo. Here, Camp taste draws on a mostly unacknowledged truth of taste: the most refined form of sexual attractiveness (as well as the most refined form of sexual pleasure) consists in going against the grain of one's sex. What is most beautiful in virile men is something feminine; what is most beautiful in feminine women is something masculine. . . . Allied to the Camp taste for the androgynous is something that seems quite different but isn't: a relish for the exaggeration of sexual characteristics and personality mannerisms. For obvious reasons, the best examples that can be cited are movie stars. The corny flamboyant female-ness of Jayne Mansfield, Gina Lollobrigida, Jane Russell, Virginia Mayo; the exaggerated he-man-ness of Steve Reeves, Victor Mature. The great stylists of temperament and mannerism, like Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, Tallulah Bankhead, Edwige Feuilli\u00e8re.\n\n10. Camp sees everything in quotation marks. It's not a lamp, but a \"lamp\"; not a woman, but a \"woman.\" To perceive Camp in objects and persons is to understand Being-as-Playing-a-Role. It is the farthest extension, in sensibility, of the metaphor of life as theater.\n\n11. Camp is the triumph of the epicene style. (The convertibility of \"man\" and \"woman,\" \"person\" and \"thing.\") But all style, that is, artifice, is, ultimately, epicene. Life is not stylish. Neither is nature.\n\n12. The question isn\u2019t, \"Why travesty, impersonation, theatricality?\" The question is, rather, \"When does travesty, impersonation, theatricality acquire the special flavor of Camp?\" Why is the atmosphere of Shakespeare's comedies (As You Like It, etc.) not epicene, while that of Der Rosenkavalier is?\n\n13. The dividing line seems to fall in the 18th century; there the origins of Camp taste are to be found (Gothic novels, Chinoiserie, caricature, artificial ruins, and so forth.) But the relation to nature was quite different then. In the 18th century, people of taste either patronized nature (Strawberry Hill) or attempted to remake it into something artificial (Versailles). They also indefatigably patronized the past. Today's Camp taste effaces nature, or else contradicts it outright. And the relation of Camp taste to the past is extremely sentimental.\n\n14. A pocket history of Camp might, of course, begin farther back -- with the mannerist artists like Pontormo, Rosso, and Caravaggio, or the extraordinarily theatrical painting of Georges de La Tour, or Euphuism (Lyly, etc.) in literature. Still, the soundest starting point seems to be the late 17th and early 18th century, because of that period's extraordinary feeling for artifice, for surface, for symmetry; its taste for the picturesque and the thrilling, its elegant conventions for representing instant feeling and the total presence of character -- the epigram and the rhymed couplet (in words), the flourish (in gesture and in music). The late 17th and early 18th century is the great period of Camp: Pope, Congreve, Walpole, etc, but not Swift; les pr\u00e9cieux in France; the rococo churches of Munich; Pergolesi. Somewhat later: much of Mozart. But in the 19th century, what had been distributed throughout all of high culture now becomes a special taste; it takes on overtones of the acute, the esoteric, the perverse. Confining the story to England alone, we see Camp continuing wanly through 19th century aestheticism (Bume-Jones, Pater, Ruskin, Tennyson), emerging full-blown with the Art Nouveau movement in the visual and decorative arts, and finding its conscious ideologists in such \"wits\" as Wilde and Firbank.\n\n15. Of course, to say all these things are Camp is not to argue they are simply that. A full analysis of Art Nouveau, for instance, would scarcely equate it with Camp. But such an analysis cannot ignore what in Art Nouveau allows it to be experienced as Camp. Art Nouveau is full of \"content,\" even of a political-moral sort; it was a revolutionary movement in the arts, spurred on by a Utopian vision (somewhere between William Morris and the Bauhaus group) of an organic politics and taste. Yet there is also a feature of the Art Nouveau objects which suggests a disengaged, unserious, \"aesthete's\" vision. This tells us something important about Art Nouveau -- and about what the lens of Camp, which blocks out content, is.\n\n16. Thus, the Camp sensibility is one that is alive to a double sense in which some things can be taken. But this is not the familiar split-level construction of a literal meaning, on the one hand, and a symbolic meaning, on the other. It is the difference, rather, between the thing as meaning something, anything, and the thing as pure artifice.\n17. This comes out clearly in the vulgar use of the word Camp as a verb, \"to camp,\" something that people do. To camp is a mode of seduction -- one which employs flamboyant mannerisms susceptible of a double interpretation; gestures full of duplicity, with a witty meaning for cognoscenti and another, more impersonal, for outsiders. Equally and by extension, when the word becomes a noun, when a person or a thing is \"a camp,\" a duplicity is involved. Behind the \"straight\" public sense in which something can be taken, one has found a private zany experience of the thing.\n\n\"To be natural is such a very difficult pose to keep up.\"\n- An Ideal Husband\n\n18. One must distinguish between na\u00efve and deliberate Camp. Pure Camp is always naive. Camp which knows itself to be Camp (\"camping\") is usually less satisfying.\n\n19. The pure examples of Camp are unintentional; they are dead serious. The Art Nouveau craftsman who makes a lamp with a snake coiled around it is not kidding, nor is he trying to be charming. He is saying, in all earnestness: Voil\u00e0! the Orient! Genuine Camp -- for instance, the numbers devised for the Warner Brothers musicals of the early thirties (42nd Street; The Golddiggers of 1933; ... of 1935; ... of 1937; etc.) by Busby Berkeley -- does not mean to be funny. Camping -- say, the plays of Noel Coward -- does. It seems unlikely that much of the traditional opera repertoire could be such satisfying Camp if the melodramatic absurdities of most opera plots had not been taken seriously by their composers. One doesn't need to know the artist's private intentions. The work tells all. (Compare a typical 19th century opera with Samuel Barber's Vanessa, a piece of manufactured, calculated Camp, and the difference is clear.)\n\n20. Probably, intending to be campy is always harmful. The perfection of Trouble in Paradise and The Maltese Falcon, among the greatest Camp movies ever made, comes from the effortless smooth way in which tone is maintained. This is not so with such famous would-be Camp films of the fifties as All About Eve and Beat the Devil. These more recent movies have their fine moments, but the first is so slick and the second so hysterical; they want so badly to be campy that they're continually losing the beat. . . . Perhaps, though, it is not so much a question of the unintended effect versus the conscious intention, as of the delicate relation between parody and self-parody in Camp. The films of Hitchcock are a showcase for this problem. When self-parody lacks ebullience but instead reveals (even sporadically) a contempt for one's themes and one's materials - as in To Catch a Thief, Rear Window, North by Northwest -- the results are forced and heavy-handed, rarely Camp. Successful Camp -- a movie like Carn\u00e9's Dr\u00f4le de Drame; the film performances of Mae West and Edward Everett Horton; portions of the Goon Show -- even when it reveals self-parody, reeks of self-love.\n\n21. So, again, Camp rests on innocence. That means Camp discloses innocence, but also, when it can, corrupts it. Objects, being objects, don't change when they are singled out by the Camp vision. Persons, however, respond to their audiences. Persons begin \"camping\": Mae West, Bea Lillie, La Lupe, Tallulah Bankhead in Lifeboat, Bette Davis in All About Eve. (Persons can even be induced to camp without their knowing it. Consider the way Fellini got Anita Ekberg to parody herself in La Dolce Vita.)\n\n22. Considered a little less strictly, Camp is either completely naive or else wholly conscious (when one plays at being campy). An example of the latter: Wilde's epigrams themselves.\n\n\"It's absurd to divide people into good and bad. People are either charming or tedious.\"\n- Lady Windemere's Fan\n\n23. In na\u00efve, or pure, Camp, the essential element is seriousness, a seriousness that fails. Of course, not all seriousness that fails can be redeemed as Camp. Only that which has the proper mixture of the exaggerated, the fantastic, the passionate, and the na\u00efve.\n\n24. When something is just bad (rather than Camp), it's often because it is too mediocre in its ambition. The artist hasn't attempted to do anything really outlandish. (\"It's too much,\" \"It's too fantastic,\" \"It's not to be believed,\" are standard phrases of Camp enthusiasm.)\n\n25. The hallmark of Camp is the spirit of extravagance. Camp is a woman walking around in a dress made of three million feathers. Camp is the paintings of Carlo Crivelli, with their real jewels and trompe-l'oeil insects and cracks in the masonry. Camp is the outrageous aestheticism of Steinberg's six American movies with Dietrich, all six, but especially the last, The Devil Is a Woman. . . . In Camp there is often something d\u00e9mesur\u00e9 in the quality of the ambition, not only in the style of the work itself. Gaud\u00ed's lurid and beautiful buildings in Barcelona are Camp not only because of their style but because they reveal -- most notably in the Cathedral of the Sagrada Familia -- the ambition on the part of one man to do what it takes a generation, a whole culture to accomplish.\n\n26. Camp is art that proposes itself seriously, but cannot be taken altogether seriously because it is \"too much.\" Titus Andronicus and Strange Interlude are almost Camp, or could be played as Camp. The public manner and rhetoric of de Gaulle, often, are pure Camp.\n\n27. A work can come close to Camp, but not make it, because it succeeds. Eisenstein's films are seldom Camp because, despite all exaggeration, they do succeed (dramatically) without surplus. If they were a little more \"off,\" they could be great Camp - particularly Ivan the Terrible I & II. The same for Blake's drawings and paintings, weird and mannered as they are. They aren't Camp; though Art Nouveau, influenced by Blake, is.\n\nWhat is extravagant in an inconsistent or an unpassionate way is not Camp. Neither can anything be Camp that does not seem to spring from an irrepressible, a virtually uncontrolled sensibility. Without passion, one gets pseudo-Camp -- what is merely decorative, safe, in a word, chic. On the barren edge of Camp lie a number of attractive things: the sleek fantasies of Dali, the haute couture preciosity of Albicocco's The Girl with the Golden Eyes. But the two things - Camp and preciosity - must not be confused.\n\n28. Again, Camp is the attempt to do something extraordinary. But extraordinary in the sense, often, of being special, glamorous. (The curved line, the extravagant gesture.) Not extraordinary merely in the sense of effort. Ripley's Believe-It-Or-Not items are rarely campy. These items, either natural oddities (the two-headed rooster, the eggplant in the shape of a cross) or else the products of immense labor (the man who walked from here to China on his hands, the woman who engraved the New Testament on the head of a pin), lack the visual reward - the glamour, the theatricality - that marks off certain extravagances as Camp.\n\n29. The reason a movie like On the Beach, books like Winesburg, Ohio and For Whom the Bell Tolls are bad to the point of being laughable, but not bad to the point of being enjoyable, is that they are too dogged and pretentious. They lack fantasy. There is Camp in such bad movies as The Prodigal and Samson and Delilah, the series of Italian color spectacles featuring the super-hero Maciste, numerous Japanese science fiction films (Rodan, The Mysterians, The H-Man) because, in their relative unpretentiousness and vulgarity, they are more extreme and irresponsible in their fantasy - and therefore touching and quite enjoyable.\n\n30. Of course, the canon of Camp can change. Time has a great deal to do with it. Time may enhance what seems simply dogged or lacking in fantasy now because we are too close to it, because it resembles too closely our own everyday fantasies, the fantastic nature of which we don't perceive. We are better able to enjoy a fantasy as fantasy when it is not our own.\n\n31. This is why so many of the objects prized by Camp taste are old-fashioned, out-of-date, d\u00e9mod\u00e9. It's not a love of the old as such. It's simply that the process of aging or deterioration provides the necessary detachment -- or arouses a necessary sympathy. When the theme is important, and contemporary, the failure of a work of art may make us indignant. Time can change that. Time liberates the work of art from moral relevance, delivering it over to the Camp sensibility. . . . Another effect: time contracts the sphere of banality. (Banality is, strictly speaking, always a category of the contemporary.) What was banal can, with the passage of time, become fantastic. Many people who listen with delight to the style of Rudy Vallee revived by the English pop group, The Temperance Seven, would have been driven up the wall by Rudy Vallee in his heyday.\n\nThus, things are campy, not when they become old - but when we become less involved in them, and can enjoy, instead of be frustrated by, the failure of the attempt. But the effect of time is unpredictable. Maybe Method acting (James Dean, Rod Steiger, Warren Beatty) will seem as Camp some day as Ruby Keeler's does now - or as Sarah Bernhardt's does, in the films she made at the end of her career. And maybe not.\n\n32. Camp is the glorification of \"character.\" The statement is of no importance - except, of course, to the person (Loie Fuller, Gaud\u00ed, Cecil B. De Mille, Crivelli, de Gaulle, etc.) who makes it. What the Camp eye appreciates is the unity, the force of the person. In every move the aging Martha Graham makes she's being Martha Graham, etc., etc. . . . This is clear in the case of the great serious idol of Camp taste, Greta Garbo. Garbo's incompetence (at the least, lack of depth) as an actress enhances her beauty. She's always herself.\n\n33. What Camp taste responds to is \"instant character\" (this is, of course, very 18th century); and, conversely, what it is not stirred by is the sense of the development of character. Character is understood as a state of continual incandescence - a person being one, very intense thing. This attitude toward character is a key element of the theatricalization of experience embodied in the Camp sensibility. And it helps account for the fact that opera and ballet are experienced as such rich treasures of Camp, for neither of these forms can easily do justice to the complexity of human nature. Wherever there is development of character, Camp is reduced. Among operas, for example, La Traviata (which has some small development of character) is less campy than Il Trovatore (which has none).\n\n\"Life is too important a thing ever to talk seriously about it.\"\n- Vera, or The Nihilists\n\n34. Camp taste turns its back on the good-bad axis of ordinary aesthetic judgment. Camp doesn't reverse things. It doesn't argue that the good is bad, or the bad is good. What it does is to offer for art (and life) a different -- a supplementary -- set of standards.\n\n35. Ordinarily we value a work of art because of the seriousness and dignity of what it achieves. We value it because it succeeds - in being what it is and, presumably, in fulfilling the intention that lies behind it. We assume a proper, that is to say, straightforward relation between intention and performance. By such standards, we appraise The Iliad, Aristophanes' plays, The Art of the Fugue, Middlemarch, the paintings of Rembrandt, Chartres, the poetry of Donne, The Divine Comedy, Beethoven's quartets, and - among people - Socrates, Jesus, St. Francis, Napoleon, Savonarola. In short, the pantheon of high culture: truth, beauty, and seriousness.\n\n36. But there are other creative sensibilities besides the seriousness (both tragic and comic) of high culture and of the high style of evaluating people. And one cheats oneself, as a human being, if one has respect only for the style of high culture, whatever else one may do or feel on the sly.\n\nFor instance, there is the kind of seriousness whose trademark is anguish, cruelty, derangement. Here we do accept a disparity between intention and result. I am speaking, obviously, of a style of personal existence as well as of a style in art; but the examples had best come from art. Think of Bosch, Sade, Rimbaud, Jarry, Kafka, Artaud, think of most of the important works of art of the 20th century, that is, art whose goal is not that of creating harmonies but of overstraining the medium and introducing more and more violent, and unresolvable, subject-matter. This sensibility also insists on the principle that an oeuvre in the old sense (again, in art, but also in life) is not possible. Only \"fragments\" are possible. . . . Clearly, different standards apply here than to traditional high culture. Something is good not because it is achieved, but because another kind of truth about the human situation, another experience of what it is to be human - in short, another valid sensibility -- is being revealed.\n\nAnd third among the great creative sensibilities is Camp: the sensibility of failed seriousness, of the theatricalization of experience. Camp refuses both the harmonies of traditional seriousness, and the risks of fully identifying with extreme states of feeling.\n\n37. The first sensibility, that of high culture, is basically moralistic. The second sensibility, that of extreme states of feeling, represented in much contemporary \"avant-garde\" art, gains power by a tension between moral and aesthetic passion. The third, Camp, is wholly aesthetic.\n\n38. Camp is the consistently aesthetic experience of the world. It incarnates a victory of \"style\" over \"content,\" \"aesthetics\" over \"morality,\" of irony over tragedy.\n\n39. Camp and tragedy are antitheses. There is seriousness in Camp (seriousness in the degree of the artist's involvement) and, often, pathos. The excruciating is also one of the tonalities of Camp; it is the quality of excruciation in much of Henry James (for instance, The Europeans, The Awkward Age, The Wings of the Dove) that is responsible for the large element of Camp in his writings. But there is never, never tragedy.\n\n40. Style is everything. Genet's ideas, for instance, are very Camp. Genet's statement that \"the only criterion of an act is its elegance\"2 is virtually interchangeable, as a statement, with Wilde's \"in matters of great importance, the vital element is not sincerity, but style.\" But what counts, finally, is the style in which ideas are held. The ideas about morality and politics in, say, Lady Windemere's Fan and in Major Barbara are Camp, but not just because of the nature of the ideas themselves. It is those ideas, held in a special playful way. The Camp ideas in Our Lady of the Flowers are maintained too grimly, and the writing itself is too successfully elevated and serious, for Genet's books to be Camp.\n\n41. The whole point of Camp is to dethrone the serious. Camp is playful, anti-serious. More precisely, Camp involves a new, more complex relation to \"the serious.\" One can be serious about the frivolous, frivolous about the serious.\n\n42. One is drawn to Camp when one realizes that \"sincerity\" is not enough. Sincerity can be simple philistinism, intellectual narrowness.\n\n43. The traditional means for going beyond straight seriousness - irony, satire - seem feeble today, inadequate to the culturally oversaturated medium in which contemporary sensibility is schooled. Camp introduces a new standard: artifice as an ideal, theatricality.\n\n44. Camp proposes a comic vision of the world. But not a bitter or polemical comedy. If tragedy is an experience of hyperinvolvement, comedy is an experience of underinvolvement, of detachment.\n\n\"I adore simple pleasures, they are the last refuge of the complex.\"\n- A Woman of No Importance\n\n45. Detachment is the prerogative of an elite; and as the dandy is the 19th century's surrogate for the aristocrat in matters of culture, so Camp is the modern dandyism. Camp is the answer to the problem: how to be a dandy in the age of mass culture.\n\n46. The dandy was overbred. His posture was disdain, or else ennui. He sought rare sensations, undefiled by mass appreciation. (Models: Des Esseintes in Huysmans' \u00c0 Rebours, Marius the Epicurean, Val\u00e9ry's Monsieur Teste.) He was dedicated to \"good taste.\"\n\nThe connoisseur of Camp has found more ingenious pleasures. Not in Latin poetry and rare wines and velvet jackets, but in the coarsest, commonest pleasures, in the arts of the masses. Mere use does not defile the objects of his pleasure, since he learns to possess them in a rare way. Camp -- Dandyism in the age of mass culture -- makes no distinction between the unique object and the mass-produced object. Camp taste transcends the nausea of the replica.\n\n47. Wilde himself is a transitional figure. The man who, when he first came to London, sported a velvet beret, lace shirts, velveteen knee-breeches and black silk stockings, could never depart too far in his life from the pleasures of the old-style dandy; this conservatism is reflected in The Picture of Dorian Gray. But many of his attitudes suggest something more modern. It was Wilde who formulated an important element of the Camp sensibility -- the equivalence of all objects -- when he announced his intention of \"living up\" to his blue-and-white china, or declared that a doorknob could be as admirable as a painting. When he proclaimed the importance of the necktie, the boutonniere, the chair, Wilde was anticipating the democratic esprit of Camp.\n\n48. The old-style dandy hated vulgarity. The new-style dandy, the lover of Camp, appreciates vulgarity. Where the dandy would be continually offended or bored, the connoisseur of Camp is continually amused, delighted. The dandy held a perfumed handkerchief to his nostrils and was liable to swoon; the connoisseur of Camp sniffs the stink and prides himself on his strong nerves.\n\n49. It is a feat, of course. A feat goaded on, in the last analysis, by the threat of boredom. The relation between boredom and Camp taste cannot be overestimated. Camp taste is by its nature possible only in affluent societies, in societies or circles capable of experiencing the psychopathology of affluence.\n\n\"What is abnormal in Life stands in normal relations to Art. It is the only thing in Life that stands in normal relations to Art.\"\n- A Few Maxims for the Instruction of the Over-Educated\n\n50. Aristocracy is a position vis-\u00e0-vis culture (as well as vis-\u00e0-vis power), and the history of Camp taste is part of the history of snob taste. But since no authentic aristocrats in the old sense exist today to sponsor special tastes, who is the bearer of this taste? Answer: an improvised self-elected class, mainly homosexuals, who constitute themselves as aristocrats of taste.\n\n51. The peculiar relation between Camp taste and homosexuality has to be explained. While it's not true that Camp taste is homosexual taste, there is no doubt a peculiar affinity and overlap. Not all liberals are Jews, but Jews have shown a peculiar affinity for liberal and reformist causes. So, not all homosexuals have Camp taste. But homosexuals, by and large, constitute the vanguard -- and the most articulate audience -- of Camp. (The analogy is not frivolously chosen. Jews and homosexuals are the outstanding creative minorities in contemporary urban culture. Creative, that is, in the truest sense: they are creators of sensibilities. The two pioneering forces of modern sensibility are Jewish moral seriousness and homosexual aestheticism and irony.)\n\n52. The reason for the flourishing of the aristocratic posture among homosexuals also seems to parallel the Jewish case. For every sensibility is self-serving to the group that promotes it. Jewish liberalism is a gesture of self-legitimization. So is Camp taste, which definitely has something propagandistic about it. Needless to say, the propaganda operates in exactly the opposite direction. The Jews pinned their hopes for integrating into modern society on promoting the moral sense. Homosexuals have pinned their integration into society on promoting the aesthetic sense. Camp is a solvent of morality. It neutralizes moral indignation, sponsors playfulness.\n\n53. Nevertheless, even though homosexuals have been its vanguard, Camp taste is much more than homosexual taste. Obviously, its metaphor of life as theater is peculiarly suited as a justification and projection of a certain aspect of the situation of homosexuals. (The Camp insistence on not being \"serious,\" on playing, also connects with the homosexual's desire to remain youthful.) Yet one feels that if homosexuals hadn't more or less invented Camp, someone else would. For the aristocratic posture with relation to culture cannot die, though it may persist only in increasingly arbitrary and ingenious ways. Camp is (to repeat) the relation to style in a time in which the adoption of style -- as such -- has become altogether questionable. (In the modem era, each new style, unless frankly anachronistic, has come on the scene as an anti-style.)\n\n\"One must have a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell without laughing.\"\n- In conversation\n\n54. The experiences of Camp are based on the great discovery that the sensibility of high culture has no monopoly upon refinement. Camp asserts that good taste is not simply good taste; that there exists, indeed, a good taste of bad taste. (Genet talks about this in Our Lady of the Flowers.) The discovery of the good taste of bad taste can be very liberating. The man who insists on high and serious pleasures is depriving himself of pleasure; he continually restricts what he can enjoy; in the constant exercise of his good taste he will eventually price himself out of the market, so to speak. Here Camp taste supervenes upon good taste as a daring and witty hedonism. It makes the man of good taste cheerful, where before he ran the risk of being chronically frustrated. It is good for the digestion.\n\n55. Camp taste is, above all, a mode of enjoyment, of appreciation - not judgment. Camp is generous. It wants to enjoy. It only seems like malice, cynicism. (Or, if it is cynicism, it's not a ruthless but a sweet cynicism.) Camp taste doesn't propose that it is in bad taste to be serious; it doesn't sneer at someone who succeeds in being seriously dramatic. What it does is to find the success in certain passionate failures.\n\n56. Camp taste is a kind of love, love for human nature. It relishes, rather than judges, the little triumphs and awkward intensities of \"character.\" . . . Camp taste identifies with what it is enjoying. People who share this sensibility are not laughing at the thing they label as \"a camp,\" they're enjoying it. Camp is a tender feeling.\n\n(Here, one may compare Camp with much of Pop Art, which -- when it is not just Camp -- embodies an attitude that is related, but still very different. Pop Art is more flat and more dry, more serious, more detached, ultimately nihilistic.)\n\n57. Camp taste nourishes itself on the love that has gone into certain objects and personal styles. The absence of this love is the reason why such kitsch items as Peyton Place (the book) and the Tishman Building aren't Camp.\n\n58. The ultimate Camp statement: it's good because it's awful . . . Of course, one can't always say that. Only under certain conditions, those which I've tried to sketch in these notes.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/7204577", "artist_names": "Christian Genius", "full_title": "September 2022 Singles Release Calendar by\u00a0Christian\u00a0Genius", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5ea087093a6cd298fe56ed7fbb99b0f4.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5ea087093a6cd298fe56ed7fbb99b0f4.866x866x1.png", "id": 7204577, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 2430266, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1666166335, "path": "/Christian-genius-september-2022-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Christian-genius-september-2022-singles-release-calendar-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2022, "month": 9, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "September 2022", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Sep. 2022", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5ea087093a6cd298fe56ed7fbb99b0f4.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5ea087093a6cd298fe56ed7fbb99b0f4.866x866x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "September 2022 Singles Release Calendar", "title_with_featured": "September 2022 Singles Release Calendar", "updated_by_human_at": 1666166335, "url": "https://genius.com/Christian-genius-september-2022-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/528115", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c57db1ca677a272a4dfdadd7b701ce29.262x262x1.jpg", "id": 528115, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0fae0945bbc7dd4920ee70a9419c10ef.262x262x1.png", "index_character": "c", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": true, "name": "Christian Genius", "slug": "Christian-genius", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Christian-genius", "iq": 20392}, "artist": "Christian Genius", "lyrics": "September 2022 Singles Release Calendar Lyrics9/1Aligned Vision, Zelijah Tishbite & 678NATH - \"Wet\" \u23f3\nCaedmon's Call - \"Hope to Carry On\"\nJoshua\u2005Parkin\u2005- \"More Than\u2005Anything\"\nMitch Darrell - \"Manly-Pedi\"\nNosa - \"Worship\u2005Medley\" \u23f39/2Adia - \"You Ain't\" \u23f3\nAdoraci\u00f3n & Majo y Dan - \"Quiero Levantar Mis Manos\" \u23f3\nAisea Taimani + Minor Islands - \"So Sure\" \u23f3\nAmongst the Giants - \"Medicated\" \u23f3\nAndres Toledo - \"Your Love Is Enough\"\nApex Frazier - \"how i feel\"\nArik Nelson - \"In His Hands\" feat.

my peers they hope I nose dived\nLike an aircraft that crashed\nThey congrats you, dap you\nWhen your back is turned they throw knives\nI ain't handicapped or slow or no average Joe\nI see past the smokin' strobelight\nPut me up against your favourite rapper\nYou sayin' snap and harder than me, close but no dice\nThe difference be in my consistency and I don't need MC's to ghost write\nWho you know that pitch that always throws strikes\nEverytime I get the ball across the goal line\nI done made it off the bottom on the slow climb\nIf you talking to my dogs they all gon' cosign\nAnd I'm sitting on a gold mine (Gold Mine!)\nSongs I write are from the heart it ain't meant for the closed mind (Closed Mind!)\nThis more than bars they're metaphors, it's a cure for the soul, I, (Soul, I!)\nSeal with the end of your rope and now I'm right here, closing by\nThird time's a charm, I already let them know, twice\n[Bridge]\nLet me set the record straight I'm the best, there ain't no one better, fuckin' let the rest debate\nI accept the hate that'll desecrate I just set the pace\nSet to detonate, some that disagree\nMust be deaf cause they, underestimate\nMe, but that's okay\nI'mma

granted I be killin' everything you hearin'\nGonna lyrically raise eyebrows\nWe ain't got to double time I do it 8 Mile style\nBorn in P.A. and was raised down South\nWhen I'm in your city hit the stage\nI bounce, from the north side up, A-Town down\nSome of these MC's need CPR\nListen to the wack MP3's I'm bored\nYour video is hard for me to sit through\nLike Kanye's speech at the MTV Awards\n(You on point Rittz?) S\u00ed se\u00f1or\nI got a pair of new shoes you probably never seen before\nI used to be dead broke with some cheap Louis V decor, inside a Regal that was leakin' oil\nBut now I cost five G's for a feature the middle finger up begging for a confrontation\nAnd #FuckAnyoneWhoSaysHashtagInAConversation\nMan I throw the peace sign, As-salamu alaykum\nCli-N-Tel was the crew and the congregation\nPeople thinkin' I've become complacent\nI'm just lookin' at the game feelin' nauseated\nLotta' rappers goin' pop like a condom breakin'\nSick of concentratin' on my skills when it's gonna be useless (Gonna be useless)\nAll the music I hear just sounds the same\nA bunch of wannabe Futures\nYou wanna be Eazy\nYou gotta be Ruthless\nYou wanna be me\nThen you gotta be the smoothest\nGonna seem breezy watchin' me do this\nGot a deep teacher and follow me students\nHit 'em with the woah (woah!)\nThat work everytime\nThen we down start singing for the hoes (ho!)\nTrippin off that line and some punk\nMight overdose, off this dope I write\nA lotta rappers wanna act like rock stars\nWhen they square as fuck but that's me for real\nI got the pills and I'm fucking with a soft heart\nFist fight with my girl in the hotel punching the mirror\nBreaking the door and the armoire\nShit I can't recall the last 15 years wishing I could do an interview with Nardwuar\nI got an early morning flight to Hartsfield\nTaking airplane shots witha chilli cheese slaw dog\nNever gonna fall off, man I know I'm on now\nGot a bunch of unknown numbers in my call log\nPeople got me all wrong\nSee my hair and the beanie and they get the wrong idea\nSay I look homeless shit my shoes 200 my shades 250 a pair\nWatch out you'll go blind\nBy the diamonds the side of my pinky that sparkle and shine\nThey call me Rittz, bitch\nTop of the line\nYa-Uh-Yeah\nYou might also likeCli-N-Tel man definetely in effect man\nIf you ain't fuckin with Rittz, pretty much you ain't top of the

A girl In a sweater.\nAnd you know what that means.\nThe season of exposed skin is over.\nExactly.\nGone are the tank tops, Ted.\nGone are the cute little skirts.\nGone are the sun dresses.\nThe sun dresses, Ted! I don't think I can make it another eight months with no sun dresses.\nBarney, I really I have to grade these papers.\nI'm sorry.\nI'll let you work.\nBut first, a riddle: What piece of women's attire most stokes a man's desire? A sun dress.\nCorrect.\nWhat lightweight outfit, pink or white, makes the front of my slacks abnormally tight? I really have to get this done.\nOf course, of course.\nThank you.\n\"Sun dress,\" by the way.\nHey! What are you nervous about?

Dibs on Marshall as my lawyer! Damn it! Where is Marshall anyway? Uncle Marshall and Aunt Lily had recently decided to take a swing at starting a family.\nTonight was their first at-bat.\nOkay, I'm almost ready to leave.\nLet's just go through the checklist.\nCandles?

It's Me, Horny.\nThat is not what \"shields up\" looks like.\nThat is what \"shields up\" looks like.\nMove.\nGod! Hey.\n'Sup, dudes? Fries? Oh, good God, woman.\nYou're a disgrace.\nNo fries for this guy.\nRobin, seriously, I love you, but it's like you have squiggly cartoon odor lines coming off of you right now.\nYou know what, Barney? Just cut her some slack, okay? She just went through a breakup.\nWith hygiene?

I will absolutely say no.\nOur friendship is too important.\nOkay, you know, maybe I wasn't clear enough.\nI will come at you with everything I've got.\nI will stalk you like the lioness stalks the gazelle: careful, patient, deadly.\nAnd if you let your guard down for so much as a second, as sure as you were born, I will hump your brains out.\nOkay, I'm ready to have sex now.\nIt was a tough summer, but I think our girl's been a real trooper.\nShe's Is this a Cheeto?

Mmm, totes, toots.\nShe's here on a date.\nShe brought the book because she got here early, and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting.\nGirls like to come across all classy and smart, you know? This? What you're doing right now? I'm getting a \"de-rection.\n\" Hey! How'd it go? You pregnant yet? Nope! Okay, so, here's what happened.\nI was at home, waiting for Marshall.\nHey! How was your day? Don't answer.\nNo time.\nBedroom.\nNo, no.\nNo time.\nFloor.\nNo, no time.\nAgainst this wall! Marshall, whoa! Wait.\nA big package just arrived.\nYeah, it did.\nNo, no.\nIt's a real package from your dad.\nWell, that's a little weird, but yeah, it is.\nMarshall, look! A bassinet? Oh, my He must've made it in his wood shop.\nWasn't that sweet of him? Lil? Isn't that sweet? Lily? You told your dad we're trying to have a baby? Of course I did.\nI tell my dad everything.\nMy dad is my best friend.\nLily, we have been looking forward to this magical, special night for two weeks now.\nAnd, sweetie, during that time, I have been How do I put this delicately? Saving all my love for you.\nI have read 11 books on conception.\nI have cut out alcohol, caffeine and sugar.\nI take my temperature every hour.\nBut good for you for not playing with yourself.\nI feel you, buddy.\nAh, no! Don't even touch me, dude.\nIt's been, like It's been two weeks.\nI'm, like, a light breeze away from having a big problem.\nSeriously.\nOkay, I'm better now.\nOkay, Barney.\nWhat's this going to cost me? Excuse me? Your dibs.\nI want to buy your dibs.\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\nBut I Can I go smell her first? - No.\n- Fine.\nAll right.\nWish me luck.\nNow kids, remember how I told you about a girl named Cindy? How I went on one date with her and it ended Get out.\nbadly? Well How are you? Good.\nWhat the hell are you doing? That girl she's talking to? I dated her.\nOh, that sucks! And dibs.\nSo you went on one date with one of her friends.\nIt's not necessarily a big deal.\nI mean, did it end on bad terms? Oh, hi Cindy! Oh, hi Cindy.\nWell, I guess you just got to move on.\nI mean, it's not like you have a shot with Ready McGee over there, right? Ted? Then I remembered.\nCindy had a roommate.\nA roommate I only caught a glimpse of But a roommate who, by every indication, was something very special.\nWas it possible? Could this be the girl attached to that ankle? I got to see her ankles.\nYou're one of those? God, I swear, one in five guys Lily! We kind of had a plan tonight, remember? Candles? Banjo? Who else did you tell? Did you tell anyone at the office? Shannon? Start the music.\nCan you dig it?! Take it to the hole, Eriksen! Sink that putt, big fuzz! Put a pillow under her lower back.\nIt helps facilitate conception, bro! I may have mentioned it in passing to a couple of colleagues at work.\nI'm sorry about that, but you know what? I got to be able to tell my dad.\nYour dad is the last person you should tell! The man is too involved in our lives! It's like, every time the phone rings Hello.\nLily, Marvin Eriksen.\nI noticed you hadn't changed your last name yet.\nNo, I'm gonna So, don't worry.\nI called the DMV, I called your Amex, I got that process started for you.\nHello.\nLily, Marvin Eriksen.\nI understand you and Marshall have been fighting.\nWell, let me tell you what works for me and the missus.\nFrilly French undies and a box of wine.\nHello.\nYou might want to try pickles on that sandwich.\nPickles would have helped that sandwich! The man has no boundaries.\nAnd I just can't procreate under these conditions! Yeah, well, you know what? I've already told him, so the damage is done.\nSo, call him and tell him we decided not to have a baby.\nOkay, so you just You want me to give my dad a stroke? Only if you want to give this a stroke.\nThat's ridiculous.\nLily, there is no way that I would ever Okay, everyone needs to shut up so that I can think! They're talking to a guy now.\nWhat kind of guy? A cheesy guy or a cool guy? Oh, a cheesy guy.\nDon't worry.\nOh, man! That guy is cool.\nHis hair's all cool, he's got a cool belt.\nWell, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy.\nWho's feeling nachos? Oh, look at you, Robin.\nYou're jealous.\nJealous? Yeah, jealous, because she's got it, and you've lost it.\nI have not lost it.\nYou lost it.\nI still have it.\nI know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want.\nRobin, girls are like cartons of milk.\nEach one has a hotness expiration date, and you've hit yours.\nI'm not saying the occasional guy won't still open the fridge, pick you up, give a sniff, shrug and take a sip anyway.\nBut it's all downhill from here.\nI don't have to take this.\nBut I do have to take this.\nOkay, so you just want me to call my dad and tell him that we're not having a baby? That's about the size of it.\nOkay, out of curiosity, when do we tell him about the baby? We'll tell him about the baby when there's a baby to tell him about.\nSo, he just gets no notice? He just walks into his boss's office, and says, \"I just had a grandson.\nI'm gonna be out for three months.\n\" Out for three months? Yeah.\nHe and my mom are coming to live with us when the baby's born.\nWe talked about this.\nNo, we didn't.\nI meant, me and my dad.\nYou know what, Marshall? Why don't you have a baby with your dad? Oh, okay, Lily.\nWhy don't you have a baby with your butt? What? I can't think straight! Why do you have to wear that shirt? This is not how I thought this night was going to go! Ted? Oh, God, this sucks! Do you think she saw me? Hi, Ted! Yeah, she definitely saw you.\nCan I see you for a minute in private? Yeah.\nYeah, sure.\nI mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her.\nOkay, will do.\nAnd dibs.\nBarney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right? Oh, you don't want my opinion on that.\nWhy not? If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him.\nThat was really Whoa, a hottie with a body! Boing! Brief.\nNo.\nLily, look.\nYou saucy little minx.\nYou sundressed up.\nHi.\nsome dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off.\nI still got it.\nAll right, buddy, you proved my point.\nNow scram.\nNice belt, by the way.\nRobin, you do look super hot.\nOh, do I? Yeah, you do.\nThanks.\nI braced myself for what was next: rage, fury, a possible shanking.\nThank you, Ted.\nAfter things didn't work out with us, I got really sad for a while.\nBut then I realized, you're not what I wanted, Ted, and I'm not what you wanted.\nI'm sorry I was such a jerk.\nI feel like I should make it up to you somehow.\nYou know, buy you a beer or Yankees tickets, or Or set me up with one of your friends.\nNo, I'm kidding.\nThat would be weird.\n- No, it wouldn't.\n- It wouldn't, would it? Any one of those three.\nWhichever's easiest and right nearby.\nAnd not the beer.\nI should get back.\nTotally.\nCome say good-bye before you leave.\nSay good-bye before you leave? Her words exactly.\nDude, you are so in.\nThat is so awesome.\nA high five doesn't even cut it.\nHigh six! She didn't see us high-six, did she? No.\nGood.\nThat was pretty lame.\nYeah, let's never do that again.\nMarshall? What? Lily, what? Are there more members of my family that you want to crap all over? - Here's the thing.\n- I'm sorry.\nHold on.\nJust It's my dad.\nLily, it's my dad, okay? I love him, and if he calls me, I'm gonna answer the phone! Hey, Dad.\nHey, hey.\nI know it's late, but I just had to call.\nHow'd it go? Dad, this is Did you do everything the books say? Did you put the pillow under her back? Dad, I'm in the middle of something right now.\nDid it feel like a boy? You can tell.\nHe's insane.\nMy dad is insane.\nI'm so sorry, Lily.\nHe's just He's so enthusiastic.\nIt's ridiculous, you know? Like, who's like that? You.\nYou're like that.\nYou and your dad both care so much.\nIt's it's why women fall in love with the Eriksen men to begin with.\nBut right now, it's a lot of pressure.\nBaby, I'm not trying to pressure you one bit.\nWhat if I can't have a baby? That could happen.\nI could totally let you down.\nHas that thought not occurred to you? Not even for one second.\nNot having a baby would suck, but the idea of you letting me down that's impossible.\nThat would be like aliens landing.\nThat's a bad example, because that could happen.\nIt probably already has.\nI saw this, episode All right.\nI'm doing this.\nI am going over there.\nWish me luck.\nKids, nothing in this life quite compares to the sweet, terrifying exhilaration of making your move.\nWhen you just put it all on the line and go for it.\nAnd that night, by golly, Cindy went for it.\nSo no, kids, that girl wasn't your mother.\nShe ended up being someone else's mother.\nIn fact, they both did.\nLike I said, she's here on a date.\nSo that was not the day I met your mother.\nThe day I met your mother was the day of a wedding.\nOkay, maybe I'm a little nervous.\nDude, it's just a wedding toast.\nI know.\nI just I want it to be great, you know? I want this whole day to be great.\nIt will be.\nBest man? You're being summoned.\nGeez, what now? Ted, seriously, relax.\nEverything's Okay, and it's raining.\nYeah.\nYou were saying? You didn't happen to bring an umbrella, did you? No.\nI didn't bring an umbrella.\nI mean, everyone told us that it might take a while, but We thought we might be the exception to the rule.\nAnyways, we're getting back on that horse.\nI mean, feeling good about the future.\nObviously, this goes without saying, but you won't tell Lily about any of this, right? No! Of course! Absolutely!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1502225", "artist_names": "Jim Croce", "full_title": "It Doesn't Have to Be That Way by\u00a0Jim\u00a0Croce",

WILL falls behind.]\n\nFINN: Let me help you with that.\n\nRACHEL: Thanks, Finn. You\u2019re so chivalrous.\n\nFINN: Thanks. That\u2019s a good thing, right?\n\n[WILL moves to walk alongside MERCEDES, ARTIE, and TINA.]\n\nWILL: Morning, guys.\n\nMERCEDES: Hey, Mr. Schue. We\u2019re just learning some runs.\n\nWILL: Oh, yeah?\n\nMERCEDES: So it goes- (vocalizing)\n\nWILL, TINA, and ARTIE: (vocalizing)\n\nWILL: With the finger, huh?\n\nMERCEDES: Pretty fly for a white guy.\n\nWILL: Oh, thank you, thank you. Hey, don\u2019t be late for rehearsal this afternoon.\nMERCEDES: Okay.\n\nWILL: All right.\n\n[WILL separates from the three and continues walking toward the school. PUCK, KURT, and five male students in letterman jackets are standing in front of the dumpster. PUCK has his arm around KURT.]\n\nWILL: Morning, Kurt.\n\nPUCK: Buenos nachos, Mr. Schue.\n\n[KURT watches WILL pass with apprehension.]\n\nWILL: (chuckling) Hey! Let\u2019s go Titans.\n\nPUCK: Yeah. Come on (To KURT).\n\nKURT: Wait.\n\n[KURT throws his bag into the arms of a jock.]\n\nKURT: One day, you will all work for me.\n\n[PUCK and another student lift KURT and toss him into the dumpster.]\n\nCUT TO:\nEXT/INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY \u2013 DAY\n\n[WILL walks down the hall and turns to address a student.]\n\nWILL: Diana, thank you so much for that apple. It was very, very nice of you. All right? (chuckles)\n\n[EMMA stands at the top of the stairs, looking at her watch before rounding the corner.  She approaches WILL as he walks toward her with his head down, and they collide.]\n\nWILL: Oh!\n\nEMMA: (gasping) Oh, Will! Oh, gosh.\n\nWILL: Hey, Emma.\n\nEMMA: Hi.\n\nWILL: Hey. I wanted to thank you so much for the advice you gave me the other day. I mean, teaching here and coaching Glee Club \u2013 It\u2019s where I belong.\n\nEMMA: Oh, it\u2019s no problem. I mean, it\u2019s what I do. You know, I give counsel and give guidance. I\u2019m a guidance counselor.\n\nWILL: Yeah, you are.\n\nEMMA: Oh, look. We match. Periwinkle.\n\nWILL: Yeah.\n\n[SANTANA and QUINN appear at the top of the stairs and walk by. SANTANA rolls her eyes.]\n\nSANTANA: (sardonically) Get a room.\n\nQUINN: Ms. Sylvester wants to see you in her office, Mr. Shue. She doesn\u2019t like to be kept waiting.\n\nWILL: You got it.\n\n[WILL chuckles nervously.]\n\n__\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. SUE\u2019S OFFICE \u2013 DAY\n\n[School bell rings. WILL opens the door.]\n\nWILL: Hey, Sue. You want to see me?\n\nSUE: Hey, buddy. Come on in.\n\n[SUE, dismounting the elliptical she had been using, wipes her face with a towel.]\n\nSUE: (groans) I just blasted my hammies.\n\nWILL: Oh.\n\nSUE: (laughs) Iron tablet?\n\n[SUE tosses a bottle of pills to WILL.]\n\nWILL: Uh-\n\nSUE: Keeps your strength up while you\u2019re menstruating.\n\nWILL: I don\u2019t menstruate.\n\nSUE: Yeah? Neither do I. So, I had a little chat with Principle Figgins and he said that if your group doesn\u2019t place at regionals, he\u2019s cutting the program. (sarcastically) Ouch.\n\nWILL: You know, you don\u2019t have to worry about Glee Club. We\u2019re gonna be fine.\n\nSUE: Really? \u2018Cause I was at the local library, where I read Cheerleading Today aloud to blind geriatrics, and I came across this little page-turner.\n\n[SUE walks over to her desk and retrieves a book, displaying the cover to WILL.]\n\nSUE: Show Choir Rule Book. And it turns out, you need 12 kids to qualify for regionals. Last time I looked, you only had five and a half. Here.\n\n[SUE hands WILL the book.]\n\nSUE: (explaining her earlier comment) Cripple in the wheelchair. I also took the liberty of highlighting some special ed classes for you. Maybe you could find some recruits.\n\n[SUE hands WILL a slip of paper and picks up a pair of hand weights. She lifts them into the air repeatedly while continuing the conversation.]\n\nSUE: \u2018Cause I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anybody else who\u2019s gonna wanna swim over to your island of misfit toys.\n\nWILL: Are you threatening me, Sue?\n\nSUE: Threatening you? Oh, no, no, no. Presenting you with an opportunity to compromise yourself? You betcha.\n\n[SUE sets the weights down.]\n\nSUE: Let\u2019s break it down. You want to be creative. You want to be in the spotlight. Face it. You want to be me.\n\n[WILL stifles a chuckle.]\n\nSUE: So here\u2019s the deal. You do with your depressing little group of kids what I did with my wealthy, elderly mother. Euthanize it. It\u2019s time. And then I\u2019ll be happy to offer you a job as my second assistant on Cheerios. You can fetch me Gatorade and launder my soiled delicates. It\u2019ll be very rewarding work for you.\n\nWILL: You know what, Sue? I politely decline your offer. Glee Club is here to stay. I believe in my kids. I know you\u2019re used to be the cock of the walk around here.\n\nSUE: Offensive.\n\nWILL: But it looks like your Cheerios are gonna have some competition. We\u2019re gonna show at regionals. You have my word on that.\n\n[WILL tosses the pills back to Sue and opens the door.]\n\nWILL: Have a good day.\n\n[WILL exits. SUE smiles to herself.]\n\n__\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY \u2013 DAY\n\n[Bell rings.  QUINN and FINN are having a conversation as FINN retrieves books from his locker. RACHEL is at her own locker a few feet from them, facing away. She angles a small mirror in her hand to watch the exchange behind her.]\n\nQUINN: We are in line to be the most popular kids in the school over the next couple years.\n\nFINN: Yeah, I know.\n\nQUINN: Prom king and queen. Homecoming court royalty. I am not giving up those shiny crowns just so you can express yourself.\n\nFINN: Look, you\u2019re making too big a deal out of this.\n\n[RACHEL closes her mirror and settles for listening intently.]\n\nQUINN: Okay. Let\u2019s compromise. If you quit the club, I\u2019ll let you touch my breast.\n\nFINN: Under the shirt?\n\nQUINN: Over the bra.\n\n[FINN pauses, momentarily conflicted.]\n\nFINN: No. No, I can\u2019t.\n\n[QUINN scoffs.]\n\nFINN: I want to do Glee. I\u2019m really happy when I\u2019m performing.\n\nQUINN: People think you\u2019re gay now, Finn. And you know what that makes me? Your big gay beard.\n\nFINN: Look. I- I gotta go to class. Okay? Just relax. Everything\u2019s gonna work out.\n\n[FINN closes his locker and exits.]\n\nQUINN: (To RACHEL) Eavesdrop much? Time for some girl talk, man hands. You can dance with him. You can sing with him. But you will never have him.\n\nRACHEL: I understand why you\u2019d be threatened. Finn and I have made a connection. But I\u2019m an honorable person. I don\u2019t need to steal your man. I have plenty of suitors of my own. Every day Glee\u2019s status is going up, and yours is going down. Deal with it.\n\n[RACHEL turns to walk away and two slushies are promptly thrown in her face. PUCK and another JOCK, the culprits, high five each other as they walk away.]\n\nPUCK: Awesome.\n\nJOCK: Holla!\n\n[Bell rings.]\n\n__\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. CHOIR ROOM - DAY\n\n[The Glee Club is singing and dancing to \u201cLe Freak\u201d by Chic. WILL critiques them as they perform.]\n\nWILL: Energy, guys! It\u2019s disco. Good with the hands. John Travolta hands. All right. We\u2019re freaking out. Let\u2019s go. And up and out and down. Good. Good. Good. Good, guys.\n\n[RACHEL kicks out her leg while dancing, coming uncomfortably close to MERCEDES\u2019 face.]\n\nMERCEDES: (To RACHEL) Whoa, whoa! Hell to the nah! First of all, you try to bust my face again, and I will cut you! (To WILL) And, also, this song is terrible.\n\nWILL: No, no, no. It\u2019s not the song. You guys just need to get into it.\n\nKURT: (annoyed) No, it\u2019s the song. It\u2019s really gay.\n\nARTIE: We need modern music, Mr. Schue.\n\nWILL: I\u2019m sorry, guys. We don\u2019t have time to discuss this. We\u2019re doing this song this Friday at the pep assembly.\n\nTINA: (incredulously) In front of the whole school?\n\nWILL: (mistaking her outburst for excitement) Exactly.\n\nKURT: They\u2019re gonna throw food at us. And I just had a facial.\n\nRACHEL: I\u2019ll press charges if that happens.\n\nWILL: Guys. I can\u2019t express to you how important this assembly is.\n\n[FINN appears terrified.  RACHEL looks at him with concern. The rest of the club are visibly upset.]\n\nWILL: We need recruits. There are six of you. We need twelve to qualify for regionals. We have no choice or the club is over. I know you guys don\u2019t like this song, but we took nationals back in \u201993 with \u201cFreak Out.\u201d It\u2019s a crowd-pleaser. Trust me. From the top.\n\nFINN: I\u2019m dead.\n\n[RACHEL continues to look concerned as the rest of the club move away.]\n\n__\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. PROSPECTIVE HOME - DAY\n\n[WILL and TERRI are seated in the living room of a house they would like to buy. A REALTOR stands before them with a small-scale model of the house.]\n\nWILL: (voice-over) My father always said you become a man when you buy your first house. I\u2019m not sure what he meant by that since he burned ours down once after a drunken fight with Mom.\n\nREALTOR: Welcome to your little slice of the American dream.\n\nTERRI: I have a question about the trees. It\u2019s always been my personal dream to cut down my own Christmas tree. How many Christmas trees will we have in the backyard? And do they come in different colors? Because, well, obviously we\u2019re expecting a family. And I have a real sense it might be a girl.\n\n[As TERRI chatters on, WILL becomes more uneasy.]\n\nWILL: [voice-over] Still, I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re actually doing this.

KENDRA\u2019s three sons are running around the table, screaming continuously and causing damage.]\n\nWILL: (voice-over) It all started when Terri\u2019s sister Kendra brought her kids over for Sunday brunch.\n\nKENDRA: (To TERRI) Well, I just don\u2019t understand where you\u2019re planning on putting the nursery.\n\nTERRI: I know.\n\nWILL: Well, we have a second bedroom.\n\nKENDRA: You are not giving up your craft room, Terri. A mother needs her respite. That craft room is the only thing that\u2019s gonna keep you from going all Susan Smith on that little angel. (To WILL) Postpartum runs in our family.\n\n[KENDRA\u2019s husband rises from his seat.]\n\nKENDRA: Where are you going?\n\nHUSBAND: (hesitantly) Bathroom. All that bran.\n\nKENDRA: No, you can\u2019t. Kyle needs his inhaler.\n\n[HUSBAND sits down, looking dejected. WILL lets out a scream over the noise and ends it with a laugh. He is overwhelmed by the screaming boys.]\n\nKENDRA: Anyway, this conversation is over. They\u2019re starting construction on a new section of our subdivision.\n\n[TERRI gasps.]\n\nKENDRA: You are not bringing my niece or nephew home to this apartment. When pigs fly.\n\nHUSBAND: (To KENDRA) Can I eat this?\n\n[WILL lets his fork drop to his plate in frustration. The screaming persists.]\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. PROSPECTIVE HOME \u2013 DAY, CONT.\n\n[The REALTOR leads TERRI and WILL through the house.]\n\nREALTOR: This banister was made by Ecuadorean children.\n\n[TERRI gasps in excitement.]\n\nWILL: It\u2019s great, Terri, but there are nine foreclosures on our street. Why can\u2019t we buy one of those? They\u2019re half the price.\n\nTERRI: I\u2019m not raising my baby in a used house. They\u2019re not clean.\n\n[They enter the kitchen and TERRI gasps.]\n\nTERRI: Look at the sun nook. Isn\u2019t it beautiful?\n\nWILL: Is it extra?\n\nREALTOR: Mm. The price in the brochure is for the basic model. Everything else is \u00e0 la carte. The grand foyer is an extra 14,000, and the sun nook is an extra 24.\n\n[WILL sighs at the price.]\n\nREALTOR: I\u2019ll let you two talk.\n\nTERRI: Thank you.\n\nWILL: Thank you. Hmm. We can\u2019t afford this.\n\nTERRI: We already did the math, Will.  All we have to do is give up Applebee\u2019s and we won\u2019t run the A.C. for the first couple of summers.\n\nWILL: Well, we certainly can\u2019t afford the grand foyer and the sun nook. I mean, if we bite off more than we can chew, we\u2019ll lose everything. You need to pick one.\n\nTERRI: (chuckles) Come with me. I\u2019m gonna show you something really special.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. PROSPECTIVE HOME, BEDROOM - DAY\n\n[WILL and TERRI are standing in the doorway of a bedroom decorated for a little girl.\n\nTERRI: This is where our daughter or gay son will sleep. I thought maybe we could put one of those mini pianos in here and you two could put on shows for me.\n\nWILL: I love it, Terri, but we still can\u2019t afford everything.\n\n[TERRI sighs.]\n\nTERRI: (To herself) It\u2019s my very own Sophie\u2019s choice. (To WILL) Fine. I\u2019m gonna give up the sun nook for the grand foyer. But I really need the polished door handles.\n\n[WILL sighs and looks away.]\n\nTERRI: Think of our family, Will. This is our dream.\n\nWILL: (voice-over) I knew in that moment that I would do whatever it took, even if it meant getting a part-time job to make some extra money to make that dream come true. (To TERRI) Let\u2019s go sign those papers.\n\n[WILL places a kiss on TERRI\u2019s forehead and exits.]\n\nTERRI: (whispering) Yes!\n\n__\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT.

That\u2019s what you are.\n\nKURT: I look like I\u2019m a part of it.\n\nMERCEDES: You\u2019re trying to copy me.\n\nKURT: It looks like I planned it.\n\nMERCEDES: You know what, if your hair was longer, you\u2019d have curls.\n\n[WILL enters. TINA and ARTIE appear on screen.]\n\nWILL: All right, guys. How about a little Kanye?\n\n[WILL begins to hand out sheet music. Several students gasp in excitement.]\n\nMERCEDES: For the assembly?\n\nWILL: No. We won\u2019t be ready in time. We\u2019re still doing disco. But we can fold this into our repertoire and it\u2019ll be awesome at regionals. Communication is the foundation of any successful music group. If we\u2019re gonna succeed, we need to communicate. You guys said you wanted modern music, I listened.\n\nARTIE: Mr. Schue, we\u2019d really like to not do disco at the assembly.\n\nWILL: Finn, you\u2019re gonna take the solo.\n\n[RACHEL smiles at FINN. FINN looks at WILL fearfully.]\n\nFINN: What? No, I- I can\u2019t do the solo, Mr. Schue. I\u2019m still learning how to walk and sing at the same time.\n\nWILL: No problem. I\u2019ll walk you through it.\n\nGLEE CLUB: Ooh!\n\nMERCEDES: Challenge.\n\nWILL: Hey, Mercedes. You know this?\n\nMERCEDES: Oh, I got this.\n\n[MERCEDES sings the opening lines to \u201cGold Digger\u201d by Kanye West.

LADIES ROOM \u2013 DAY\n\n[EMMA steps out of a stall, gingerly holding her hands in the air as she approaches the sinks. Someone can be heard coughing and retching, so EMMA goes to investigate. She opens the stall to find RACHEL on her knees, hunched over the toilet.]\n\nEMMA: Rachel, did you just throw up?\n\nRACHEL: No.\n\nEMMA: You missed the toilet.\n\nRACHEL: The girl who was throwing up before me left that. I tried, but I guess I just don\u2019t have a gag reflex.\n\nEMMA: One day when you\u2019re older, that\u2019ll turn out to be a gift. Let\u2019s have a little chat, okay?\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT.

I tried it and failed and won\u2019t ever attempt it again.\n\nEMMA: Okay.\n\nRACHEL: It grossed me out.\n\nEMMA: Okay. But I still want to talk about the feelings that you had that led up to you wanting to puke your guts out.\n\nRACHEL: I want to be thinner. Prettier, like that Quinn girl.\n\nEMMA: Mm-hm. And, um, why is that?\n\nRACHEL: Have you ever liked someone so much you just wanna lock yourself in your room, turn on sad music and cry?\n\nEMMA: No.\n\n[EMMA\u2019s eyes flicker to WILL in the hallway.]\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. EMMA\u2019S CAR \u2013 DAY\n\n[EMMA sits in her car, crying.

You need to remember, Rachel, to protect your heart. I don\u2019t care who he is. If he doesn\u2019t like you for the way you are, if he\u2019s- You know, he\u2019s married with a baby on the way- That\u2019s not worth the heartache. You don\u2019t want to compromise yourself for that. Um- (clears throat) Have you just tried telling him how you feel?\n\nRACHEL: (dejectedly) He doesn\u2019t even notice me.\n\nEMMA: I see. Um- okay. Well, here\u2019s what I think. Common interests are the key to romance. All right? So find out what he likes. Then he\u2019ll see you in a positive way and maybe you\u2019ll end up doing something that you never would have expected.\n\n[RACHEL nods and smiles hopefully.]\n\n__\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT.

SUE and WILL stand on opposite sides of the room.]\n\nSUE: Would you like to tell Principal Figgins and Mr. Schuester what I caught you two doing?\n\nFINN: It just sort of happened.\n\nRACHEL: I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but I think she\u2019s overreacting.\n\nSUE: You watch your tone, young lady. (To FIGGINS) Gay parents encourage rebellion. There are studies on this.\n\nWILL: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. (To RACHEL) All right, tell me what happened, Rachel.\n\nRACHEL: Finn was worried about having to perform a solo at the pep assembly in front of his chromosomally challenge friends. I was immediately concerned by his lack of self-esteem and made a creative preemptive strike.\n\nFINN: Yeah, pretty much what she said.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. ART ROOM \u2013 DAY\n\n[RACHEL and FINN are sitting at the table, working on a flyer.]\n\nRACHEL: You know, one of the amazing things about being in the performing arts is that you can parlay it into so many different fields. Like Justin Timberlake- He\u2019s a singer, but he also has a clothing line. And, you know, he makes things like shirts and belts.\n\nFINN: Who\u2019s Justin Timberlake?\n\nRACHEL: (voice-over) It was a twofold plan.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. COPY ROOM \u2013 DAY\n\n[RACHEL and FINN are making copies of their flyer.]\n\nRACHEL: (voice-over) We figured that with the right marketing strategy, we could pull from the entire student body without having an assembly, thus creating the diverse Glee Club this school has been craving.\n\n[SUE steps into the room. When she realizes what they are doing, she drops her protein shake on the floor.]\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. FIGGINS\u2019 OFFICE \u2013 DAY, CONT.\n\nSUE: That copy machine is for Cheerios use only. Paid for by alumni donations. I can\u2019t begin to fathom the damage you\u2019d have done to the program had you broken it.\n\nWILL: Hold on a second, Sue.\n\nSUE: I resent being told to hold on to anything, William. I will not be treated like a second-class citizen because of my gender. There is a very clear bureaucracy when it comes to photocopies, and you seem to think that these procedures don\u2019t apply to your students. (To FIGGINS) It is my strong recommendation that both these students be hobbled.\n\nWILL: (To FINN and RACHEL) How many copies did you guys make?\n\nSUE: (To FIGGINS) Seventeen.\n\nWILL: Okay. And how much does a photocopy cost?\n\nFIGGINS: Four and a half cents.\n\nWILL: How about they just pay for the copies?\n\nFIGGINS: I like this compromise. Children, pay Ms. Sylvester, and we\u2019ll let you off with a warning.

No. Or do you think that those kids- that they give a damn that we go with so little because you spend all your spare time choreographing those stupid dance routines?

Still, it is a productive way for us guys to get together and talk about sexual issues.\n\nJACOB: I think I\u2019m gonna kill myself. I\u2019m serious. We\u2019re bombarded with sexual imagery every day- Beer ads, those short skirts. I\u2019m supposed to be surrounded by temptation- Not be able to do anything about it?\n\nPUCK: Are you kidding?

This is a joke. Did you know that most studies have demonstrated that celibacy doesn\u2019t work in high schools? Our hormones are driving us too crazy to abstain. The second we start telling ourselves that there\u2019s no room for compromise, we act out. The only way to deal with teen sexuality is to be prepared. That\u2019s what contraception is for.\n\nQUINN: Don\u2019t you dare mention the \u201cC\u201d word.\n\nRACHEL: You want to know a dirty little secret that none of them want you to know?

That was the most offensive thing I\u2019ve seen in 20 years of teaching, and that includes an elementary school production of Hair.\n\nFIGGINS: We\u2019ve received angry e-mails from a number of concerned parents, many of whom thought that their children were going to hear a Special Olympian speak about overcoming adversity.\n\nWILL: I- I really don\u2019t know what to say.\n\nSUE: Well, let me help you out then. My first thought was that your students should be put into foster care. But you\u2019re the one that should be punished. I demand your resignation from this school as well as the disbanding of Glee Club.\n\nFIGGINS: Now, hold on, Sue.  The issue is content. Those kids are talented. And I have not seen the student body this excited since Tiffany performed at the North Hills Mall. I took the liberty of calling my pastor to provide a list of family-friendly songs that reflect our community\u2019s values. Your kids can only perform these preapproved musical selections.\n\n[FIGGINS hands WILL the list.]\n\nWILL: But, all of these songs have either \u201cJesus\u201d or \u201cballoons\u201d in the title.\n\nFIGGINS: But there are also songs about the circus. This egg is sunny-side up, Will. You need new outfits. I got several flashes of panty from your group today, and I\u2019m not talking about the girls. So, Sue, I\u2019m cutting your dry-cleaning budget to pay for new costumes for the Glee Club.\n\nSUE: This will not stand.\n\nFIGGINS: Oh, Sue.

You talk a lot more than you should, and to be honest with you, I looked under the bed and made sure that you weren\u2019t hanging out under there. But then I heard you sing. I don\u2019t know how to say this, but you touched something in me. Right here.\n\n[FINN places his hand left hand over his chest.

If we\u2019re gonna succeed, we both need to change our mindsets. You\u2019re not always gonna be the star. But I promise to do my best to make sure you\u2019re always having fun.

today\n\n[Verse 2]\nBut the billboards on the highways and the brake lights on the cars\nMake me jump out on the highway with my bag and my guitar\nIf she comes or if she goes it doesn't matter anymore\n'Cause I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico\n[Chorus]\nRidin' my thumb to Mexico\nIt don't matter when or how I go\nI'll ride this thumb 'til I see her again\nSo I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell the reason why she left me's not the reason that I'm here\nI'm a traveling kind of man just need a change of atmosphere\nIf there's any place I haven't been at all that's where I'll go\nSo I'm ridin' my thumb to Mexico\n\n[Chorus]\nRidin' my thumb to Mexico\nIt don't matter when or how I go\nI'll ride this thumb 'til I see her again\nSo I'm ridin' my thumb to MexicoYou

Smoke! Smoke! (That Cigarette) LyricsTravis-Williams\n\nCho: Smoke! Smoke! Smoke that cigarette!\nPuff, Puff, Puff and if you smoke yourself to death\nTell Saint Peter at the Golden Gate\nThat you hate to make him wait\nBut you've just got to have another cigarette\n\nNow I'm a feller with a heart of gold\nAnd the ways of a gentleman, I've been told\nThe kind of a guy that wouldn't even harm a flea--\nBut if me and a certain character met\nThe guy that invented the cigarette\nI'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree--\nNot 'cause I don't smoke myself\nAnd I don't reckon they'll harm your health\nI've smoked all my life and ain't dead yet\nBut nicotine slaves are all the same\nAt a pettin' party or a poker game\nEverything must stop while they smoke that cigarette\nIn a game of chance the other night\nOld Dame Fortune was a-doin' me right\nThe Kings and Queens just kept on comin' around--\nI played 'em hard and bet 'em high\nBut my bluff didn't work on a certain guy\nHe kept on raisin' and layin' the money down\nHe'd raise me and I'd raise him\nI sweated blood gotta sink or swim\nHe finally called and didn't raise the bet--\nI said \"Aces full, pal,--how 'bout you?\"\nHe said \"I'll tell you in a minute or two\nRight now I've just got to have a cigarette.\"\n\nThe other night I had a date\nWith the cutest little girl in the forty eight states\nA high-bred, uptown, fancy little dame--\nShe said she loved me and it seemed to me\nThat things were 'bout like they oughta be\nSo hand in hand we strolled down lover's lane--\nShe was oh, so far from a cake of ice\nOur smoochin' party was a-goin nice\nSo help me Hannah, I think I'd a been there yet--\nBut I give her a kiss and a little squeeze\nAnd she said \"Tex excuse me please\nI've just got to have another cigarette.\"\nYou might also likeWell life ain't nothing but a poker game\nNo two hands quite the same\nBut I never saw a winner that didn't bet\n\nSo if any people tryin' to quit\nI ain't gonna criticize you one bit\nJust make mine a Jamaican cigaretteEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

you still see me even here?\"\n(The silver cord lies on the ground.)\n\"And so I'm dead\", the young man said - over the hill (not a wish away)\nMy friends (as one) all stand aligned, although their taxis came too late\nThere was a rush along the Fulham Road\nThere was a hush in the Passion Play\nSuch a sense of glowing in the aftermath ripe with rich attainments\nAll imagined sad misdeeds in disarray the sore thumb screams aloud\nEchoing out of the Passion Play\n\nAll the old familiar choruses come crowding in a different key:\nMelodies decaying in sweet dissonance\nThere was a rush along the Fulham Road\nInto the Ever-passion Play\n\nAnd who comes here to wish me well?\nA sweetly-scented angel fell\nShe laid her head upon my disbelief\nAnd bathed me with her ever-smile\nAnd with a howl across the sand\nI go escorted by a band of gentlemen in leather bound\nNO-ONE (but someone to be found)\n\nRe-Assuring Tune\nInstrumental part\n\nMemory Bank\nAll along the icy wastes there are faces smiling in the gloom\nRoll up roll down, Feeling unwound? Step into the viewing room\nThe cameras were all around. We've got you taped; you're in the play\nHere's your I.D. (Ideal for identifying one and all.)\nInvest your life in the memory bank; ours the interest and we thank you\nThe ice-cream lady wets her drawers, to see you in the passion play\nYou might also likeTake the prize for instant pleasure\nCaptain of the cricket team\nPublic speaking in all weathers\nA knighthood from a queen\n\nBest Friends\nAll of your best friends' telephones never cooled from the heat of your hand\nThere's a line in a front-page story, 13 horses that also-ran\nClimb in your old umbrella\nDoes it have a nasty tear in the dome?\n\nBut the rain only gets in sometimes and the sun never leaves you alone\n\nCritique Oblique\nLover of the black and white it's your first night\nThe Passion Play, goes all the way, spoils your insight\nTell me how the baby's made, how the lady's laid\nWhy the old dog howls in sadness\n\nAnd your little sister's immaculate virginity wings away\nOn the bony shoulders of a young horse named George\nWho stole surreptitiously into her geography revision\n(The examining body examined her body.)\n\nActor of the low-high Q, let's hear your view\nPeek at the lines upon your sleeves since your memory won't do\nTell me: how the baby's graded, how the lady's faded\nWhy the old dogs howl with madness\nAll of this and some of that's the only way to skin the cat\nAnd now you've lost a skin or two, you're for us and we for you\nThe dressing room is right behind\nWe've got you taped, you're in the play\nHow does it feel to be in the play?\nHow does it feel to play the play?\nHow does it feel to be the play?\n\nMan of passion rise again, we won't cross you out:\nFor we do love you like a son, of that there's no doubt\nTell us: is it you who are here for our good cheer?\nOr are we here for the glory, for the story, for the gory satisfaction\nOf telling you how absolutely awful you really are?\n\nThere was a rush along the Fulham Road\nThere was a hush in the Passion Play\n\nForest Dance No.1\nInstrumental partEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

-\nBluegrass and String Band Music\n\nBluegrass and string band music has one of the most fiercely loyal audiences in American music.  Followers don't look at it so much as entertainment as they do a way of life.  You'll frequently see the makeup of these bands are family members, and many make it their life's work.  That kind of devotion says a lot about the values they see in the music. Whether it's history and tradition they hear, or that they hear it as a true expression of Americana, the performers and their audiences are passionate. You'll find a great presentation of this in a thesis by Leslie Blake Price entitled Bluegrass Nation: A Historical and Cultural Analysis of America's Truest Music.\n\nAny discussion of country or bluegrass music must acknow-ledge the contributions of the Carter Family.  They were one of the most influential groups in country music history, and they moved the emphasis from hillbilly instrumentals to \"folk stories in song\".  The original group consisted of A.P., his wife Sara, and her sister Maybelle.  They influenced all that followed in country and folk music, from Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Doc Watson all the way up to Bob Dylan, Emmylou Harris and Ketch Secor.\n\nIt's unlikely that bluegrass music would exist today without the Carter Family's contributions. A.P. collected hundreds of Appalachian folk songs and rearranged them into the classics we have today.  They recorded hundreds of songs. but \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\", \"Wildwood Flower\", and \"Keep on the Sunny Side\" will give you a good sense of what their music did to build the folk tradition in country music.\n\nThat foundation work was built-up by those who followed.  In bluegrass, there are no better examples of where we are today today than Earl Skruggs' \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\", the Foggy Mountain Boys' \"Rollin' in My Sweet Baby's Arms\" or the Osborne Brothers' \"Rocky Top\", but here is a short list of more recent (and also great) examples of bluegrass and string music:Old Crow Medicine Show's \"Sweet Amarillo\"The SteelDrivers' \"Wearin' a Hole\"The Grascals' \"Old Friend of Mine\"Dailey & Vincent's \"Take Me Back (And Leave Me There)\"Aly Bain, Jerry Douglas and Russ Barenberg's\n\"St. Anne's Reel\"Wilson Banjo Company's \"95 Years\"Yonder Mountain String Band's \"Alison\"Top Ten Music Shrines in Tennessee\nIf you're into music and history, here are some great places to visit when you're in Tennessee:In the Coastal Plains region:Graceland - Memphis\nElvis promised his parents he'd build them the finest house in town, and put an end to years of struggle. Graceland was the fulfillment of that dream.Sun Studios - Memphis\nJohhny Cash, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis recorded here - all at the same time.Stax American Soul Music Museum - Memphis\nStax made hit soul music in the 50s and 60s, and this is one of only a few museums dedicated to soul.In the Nashville Basin region:Country Music Hall of Fame - Nashville\nThe museum\u2019s core exhibition is \"Sing Me Back Home: A Journey Through Country Music\". It's a full-immersion experience.Ryman Auditorium - Nashville\nThe first Grand Ole Opry started here in 1925. It's almost like being in a cathedral.Johnny Cash Museum - Nashville\nIt's captivating, real and raw - just like Cash himself.Jack Daniel's Distillery - Lynchburg\nWhat, you ask, does Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 have to do with Tennessee music?In the Cumberland/TN Valley/Unaka Mtns region:Cumberland Caverns - McMinnville\nBluegrass concerts are presented every month in the Volcano Room of Cumberland Caverns. They've been featured on NBC and PBS.Dollywood - Pigeon Forge\nThink of it as Disneyland with a bluegrass soundtrack.Birthplace of Country Music Museum - Bristol\nTells the story of the 1927 Bristol Sessions recordings that included the Carter Family and Jimmie RodgersTennessee Artists:Here's a list of some of the most famous musicians that were born in Tennessee or made the state their home. Each artist is listed with one - three songs to give you a sampler of their music. The list is long, but not comprehensive. Think of it as a primer. (With apologies to our Texas readers for the inclusion of Townes Van Zandt and other sons of the republic.

THE PERCEPTION OF SPACE. [1] LyricsTHE FEELING OF CRUDE EXTENSITY.\n\nIN the sensations of hearing, touch, sight, and pain we are accustomed to distinguish from among the other elements the element of voluminousness. We call the reverberations of a thunderstorm more voluminous than the squeaking of a slate-pencil; the entrance into a warm bath gives our skin a more massive feeling than the prick of a pin; a little neuralgic pain, fine as a cobweb, in the face, seems less extensive than the heavy soreness of a boil or the vast discomfort of a colic or a lumbago; and a solitary star looks smaller than the noonday sky. In the sensation of dizziness or subjective motion, which recent investigation has proved to be connected with stimulation of the semi-circular canals of the ear, the spatial character is very prominent. Whether the 'muscular sense' directly yields us knowledge of space is still a matter of litigation among psychologists. Whilst some go so far as to ascribe our entire cognition of extension to its exclusive aid, others deny to it all extensive quality whatever. Under these circumstances we shall do better to adjourn its consideration; admitting, however, that it seems at first sight as if we felt something decidedly more voluminous when we contract our thigh-muscles than when we twitch an eyelid or some small muscle in the face. It seems, moreover, as if this difference lay in the feeling of the thigh-muscles themselves.\n\nIn the sensations of smell and taste this element of varying vastness seems less prominent but not altogether absent. Some tastes and smells appear less extensive than complex flavors, like that of roast meat or plum pudding, on the one hand, or heavy odors like musk or tuberose, on the other. The epithet sharp given to the acid class would seem to show that to the popular mind there is something narrow and, as it were, streaky, in the impression they make, other flavors and odors being bigger and rounder. The sensations derived from the inward organs are also distinctly more or less voluminous. Repletion and emptiness, suffocation, palpitation, headache, are examples of this, and certainly not less spatial is the consciousness we have of our general bodily condition in nausea, fever, heavy drowsiness, and fatigue. Our entire cubic content seems then sensibly manifest to us as such, and feels much larger than any local pulsation, pressure, or discomfort. Skin and retina are, however, the organs in which the space-element plays the most active part. Not only does the maximal vastness yielded by the retina surpass that yielded by any other organ, but the intricacy with which our attention can subdivide this vastness and perceive it to be composed of lesser portions simultaneously coexisting along-side of each other is without a parallel elsewhere. [2] The ear gives a greater vastness than the skin, but is considerably less able to subdivide it. [3]\n\nNow my first thesis is that this element, discernible in each and every sensation, though more developed in some than in others, is the original sensation of space, out of which all the exact knowledge about space that we afterwards come to have is woven by processes of discrimination, association, and selection. 'Extensity,' as Mr. James Ward calls it [4] on this view, becomes an element in each sensation just as intensity is. The latter every one will admit to be a distinguishable though not separable ingredient of the sensible quality. In like manner extensity, being an entirely peculiar kind of feeling indescribable except in terms of itself, and inseparable in actual experience from some sensational quality which it must accompany, can itself receive no other name than that of sensational element.\n\nIt must now be noted that the vastness hitherto spoken of is as great in one direction as in another. Its dimensions are so vague that in it there is no question as yet of surface as opposed to depth; 'volume' being the best short name for the sensation in question. Sensations of different orders are roughly comparable, inter se, with respect to their volumes. This shows that the spatial quality in each is identical wherever found, for different qualitative elements, e.g. warmth and odor, are incommensurate. Persons born blind are reported surprised at the largeness with which objects appear to them when their sight is restored. Franz says of his patient cured of cataract: \"He saw everything much larger than he had supposed from the idea obtained by his sense of touch. Moving, and especially living, objects appeared very large.\" [5] Loud sounds have a certain enormousness of feeling. It is impossible to conceive of the explosion of a cannon as fining a small space. In general, sounds seem to occupy all the room between us and their source; and in the case of certain ones, the cricket's song, the whistling of the wind, the roaring of the surf, or a distant railway train, to have no definite starting point.\n\nIn the sphere of vision we have facts of the same order. 'Glowing' bodies, as Hering says, give us a perception \"which seems roomy (raumhaft) in comparison with that of strictly surface color. A glowing iron looks luminous through and through, and so does a flame.\" [6] A luminous fog, a band of sunshine, affect us in the same way. As Hering urges:\n\" We must distinguish roomy from superficial, as well as distinctly from indistinctly bounded, sensations. The dark which with closed eyes one sees before one is, for example, a roomy sensation. We do not see a black surface like a wall in front of us, but a space fined with darkness, and even when we succeed in seeing this darkness as terminated by a black wall there still remains in front of this wall the dark space. The same thing happens when we find ourselves with open eyes in an absolutely dark room. This sensation of darkness is also vaguely bounded. An example of a distinctly bounded roomy sensation is that of a clear and colored fluid seen in a glass; the yellow of the wine is seen not, only on the bounding surface of the glass; the yellow sensation fins the whole interior of the glass. By day the so-called empty space between us and objects seen appears very different from what it is by night. The increasing darkness settles not only upon the things but also between us and the things. so as at last to cover them completely and fin the space alone. If I look into a dark box I find it fined with darkness, and this is seen not merely as the dark-colored sides or walls of the box. A shady corner in an otherwise well-lighted room is full of a darkness which is not only on the walls and floor but between them in the space they include. Every sensation is there where I experience it, and if I have it at once at every point of a certain roomy space, it is then a voluminous sensation. A cube of transparent green glass gives us a spatial sensation; an opaque cube painted green, on the contrary, only sensations of surface.\" [7]\n\nThere are certain quasi-motor sensations in the head when we change the direction of the attention, which equally seem to involve three dimensions. If with closed eyes we think of the top of the house and then of the cellar, of the distance in front of us and then of that behind us, of space far to the right and then far to the left, we have something far stronger than an idea, -- an actual feeling, namely, as if something in the head moved into another direction. Fechner was, I believe, the first to publish any remarks on these feelings. He writes as follows:\n\n\"When we transfer the attention from objects of one sense to those of another we have an indescribable feeling (though at the same time one perfectly determinate and reproducible at pleasure) of altered direction, or differently localized tension (Spannung). We feel a strain forward in the eyes, one directed sideways in the ears, increasing with the degree of our attention, and changing according as we look at an object carefully, or listen to something attentively ; wherefore we speak of straining the attention. The difference is most plainly felt when the attention vibrates rapidly between eye and ear. This feeling localizes itself with most decided difference in regard to the various sense-organs according as we wish to discriminate a thing delicately by touch, taste, or smell.\n\n\"But now I have, when I try to vividly recall a picture of memory or fancy, a feeling perfectly analogous to that which I experience when I seek to grasp a thing keenly by eye or ear; and this analogous feeling is very differently localized. While in sharpest possible attention to real objects (as well as to after-images) the strain is plainly forwards, and, when the attention changes from one sense to another, only alters its direction between the sense-organs, leaving the rest of the head free from strain, the case is different in memory or fancy; for here the feeling withdraws entirely from the external sense-organs, and seems rather to take refuge in that part of the head which the brain fins. If I wish, for example, to recall a place or person, it will arise before me with vividness, not according as I strain my attention forwards, but rather in proportion as I, so to speak, retract it backwards.\" [8]\n\nIt appears probable that the feelings which Fechner describes are in part constituted by imaginary semi-circular canal sensations. [9] These undoubtedly convey the most delicate perception of change in direction; and when, as here, the changes are not perceived as taking place in the external world, they occupy a vague internal space located within the head. [10]\n\nIn the skin itself there is a vague form of projection into the third dimension to which Hering has called attention.\n\n\" Heat is not felt only against the cutaneous surface, but when communicated through the air may appear extending more or less out from the surface into the third dimension of surrounding space... We can determine in the dark the place of a radiant body by moving the hand to and fro, and attending to the fluctuation of our feeling of warmth. The feeling itself, however; is not projected fully into the spot at which we localize the hot body, but always remains in the neighborhood of the hand.\"\n\nThe interior of one's mouth-cavity feels larger when explored by the tongue than when looked at. The crater of a, newly-extracted tooth, and the movements of a loose tooth in its socket, feel quite monstrous. A midge buzzing against the drum of the ear will often seem as big as a butterfly. The spatial sensibility of the tympanic membrane has hitherto been very little studied, though the subject will well repay much trouble. If we approach it by introducing into the outer ear some small object like the tip of a rolled-up tissue-paper lamplighter, we are surprised at the large radiating sensation which its presence gives us, end at the sense of clearness and openness which comes when it is removed. It is immaterial to inquire whether the far-reaching sensation here be due to actual irradiation upon distant nerves or not. We are considering now, not the objective causes of the spatial feeling, but its subjective varieties, and the experiment shows that the same object gives more of it to the inner than to the outer cuticle of the ear. The pressure of the air in the tympanic cavity upon the membrane gives an astonishingly large sensation. We increase the pressure by holding our nostrils and closing our mouth and forcing air through our Eustachian tubes by an expiratory effort; and we can diminish it by either inspiring or swallowing under the same conditions of closed mouth and nose. In either case me get a large round tridimensional sensation inside of the head, which seems as if it must come from the affection of an organ much larger than the tympanic membrane, whose surface hardly exceeds that of one's little-finger-nail.\n\nThe tympanic membrane is furthermore able to render sensible differences in the pressure of the external atmosphere, too slight to be, felt either as noise or in this more violent way. If the reader will sit with closed eyes and let a friend approximate some solid object, like a large book, noiselessly to his face, he min immediately become aware of the object's presence and position -- likewise of its departure. A friend of the writer, making the experiment for the first time, discriminated unhesitatingly between the three degrees of solidity of a board, a lattice-frame, and a sieve, held close to his ear. Now as this sensation is never used by ordinary persons as a means of perception, we may fairly assume that its felt quality, in those whose attention is called to it for the first time, belongs to it qu\u00e2 sensation, and owes nothing to educational suggestions. But this felt quality is most distinctly and unmistakably one of vague spatial vastness in three dimensions -- quite as much so as is the felt quality of the retinal sensation when we lie on our back and fin the entire held of vision with the empty blue sky. When an object is brought near the ear we immediately feel shut in, contracted; when the object is removed, we suddenly feel as if a transparency, clearness, openness, had been made outside of us. And the feeling will, by any one who will take the pains to observe it, be acknowledged to involve the third dimension in a vague, unmeasured state. [11]\n\nThe reader will have noticed, in this enumeration of facts, that voluminousness of the feeling seems to bear very little relation to the size of the organ that yields it. The ear and eye are comparatively minute organs, yet they give us feelings of great volume. The same lack of exact proportion between size of feeling and size of organ affected obtains within the limits of particular sensory organs. An object appears smaller on the lateral portions of the retina than it does on the fovea, as may be easily verified by holding the two forefingers parallel and a couple of inches apart, and transferring the gaze of one eye from one to the other. Then the finger not directly looked at will appear to shrink, and this whatever be the direction of the fingers. On the tongue a crumb, or the calibre of a small tube, appears larger than between the fingers. If two points kept equidistant (blunted compass- or scissors-points, for example) be drawn across the skin so as really to describe a pair of parallel lines, the lines will appear farther apart in some spots than in others. If, for example, me draw them horizontally across the face, so that the mouth falls between them, the person experimented upon will feel as if they began to diverge near the mouth and to include it in a well- marked ellipse. In like manner, if we keep the compass-\n\npoints one or two centimetres apart, and draw them down the forearm over the wrist and palm, finally drawing one along one finger, the other along its neighbor, the appearance will be that of a single line, soon. breaking into two, which become more widely separated below the wrist, to contract again in the palm, and finally diverge rapidly again towards the finger-tips. The dotted lines in Figs. 51 and 52 represent the true path of the compass-points; the full lines their apparent path. The same length of skin, moreover, will convey a more extensive sensation according to the manlier of stimulation. If the edge of a card be pressed against the skis, the distance between its extremities will seem shorter than that between two compass-tips touching the same terminal points. [12] [142]\n\nIn the eye, intensity of nerve-stimulation seems to increase\n\nthe volume of the feeling as well as its brilliancy. If we raise and lower the gas alternately, the whole room and all the objects in it seem alternately to enlarge and contract. If we cover half a page of small print with a gray glass, the print seen through the glass appears decidedly smaller than that seen outside of it, and the darker the glass the greater the difference. When a circumscribed opacity in front of the retina, keeps off part of the light from the portion which it covers, objects projected on that portion may seem but half as large as when their image falls outside of it. [13] The inverse effect seems produced by certain drugs and an\u00e6sthetics. Morphine, atropine, daturine, and cold blunt the sensibility of the skin, so that distances upon it seem less. Haschish produces strange perversions of the general sensibility. Under its influence one's body may seem either enormously enlarged or strangely contracted. Sometimes a single member will alter its proportion to the rest; or one's back, for instance, will appear entirely absent, as if one mere hollow behind. Objects comparatively near will recede to a vast distance, a short street assume to the eye an immeasurable perspective. Ether and chloroform occasionally produce not wholly dissimilar results. Panum, the German physiologist, relates that when, as a, boy, he was etherized for neuralgia, the objects in the room grew extremely small and distant, before his held of vision dark-hued over and the roaring in his ears began. He also mentions that a friend of his in church, struggling in vain to keep awake, saw the preacher grow smaller and smaller and more and more distant. I myself on one occasion observed the same recession of objects during the beginning of chloroformization. In various cerebral diseases we find analogous disturbances.\nCan we assign the physiological conditions which make the elementary sensible largeness of one sensation vary so much from that of another? Only imperfectly. One factor in the result undoubtedly is the number of nerve-terminations simultaneously excited by the outward agent that awakens the sensation. When many skin-nerves are warmed, or much retinal surface illuminated, our feeling is larger than when a lesser nervous surface is excited. The single sensation yielded by two compass-points, although it seems simple, is yet felt to be much bigger and blunter than that yielded by one. The touch of a single point may always be recognized by its quality of sharpness. This page looks much smaller to the reader if he closes one eye than if both eyes are open. So does the moon, which latter fact shows that the phenomenon has nothing to do with parallax. The celebrated boy couched for the cataract by Cheselden thought, after his first eye was operated, \"all things he saw extremely large,\" but being couched of his second eye, said \"that objects at first appeared large to this eye, but not so large as they did at first to the other; and looking upon the same object with both eyes, he thought it looked about twice as large as with the first couched eye only, but not double, that we can anyways discover.\"\n\nThe greater extensiveness that the feeling of certain parts of the same surface has over other parts, and that one order of surface has over another (retina over skin, for example), may also to a certain extent be explained by the operation of the same factor. It is an anatomical fact that the most spatially sensitive surfaces (retina, tongue, finger- tips, etc.) are supplied by nerve-trunks of unusual thickness, which must supply to every unit of surface-area an unusually large number of terminal fibres. But the variations of felt extension obey probably only a very rough law of numerical proportion to the number of fibres, A sound is not twice as voluminous to two ears as to one; and the above-cited variations of feeling, when the same surface is excited under different conditions, show that the feeling is a resultant of several factors of which the anatomical one is only the principal. Many ingenious hypotheses have been brought forward to assign the co-operating factors where different conditions give conflicting amounts of felt space, Later we shall analyze some of these cases in detail, but it must be confessed here in advance that many of them resist analysis altogether. [14]\n\nTHE PERCEPTION OF SPATIAL ORDER.\n\nSo far, all we have established or sought to establish is the existence of the vague form or quale of spatiality as an inseparable element bound up with the other peculiarities of each and every one of our sensations. The numerous examples we have adduced of the variations of this extensive element have only been meant to make clear its strictly sensational character. In very few of them will the reader have been able to explain the variation by an added intellectual element, such as the suggestion of a recollected experience. In almost all it has seemed to be the immediate psychic effect of a peculiar sort of nerve-process excited; and all the nerve-processes in question agree in yielding what space they do yield, to the mind, in the shape of a simple total vastness, in which, primitively at least, no order of parts or of subdivisions reigns.\n\nLet no one be surprised at this notion of a space without order. There may be a space without order just as there may be an order without space. [15] And the primitive perceptions of space are certainly of an unordered kind. The order which the spaces first perceived potentially include must, before being distinctly apprehended by the mind, be woven into those spaces by a rather complicated set of intellectual acts. The primordial largenesses which the sensations yield must be measured and subdivided by consciousness, and added together, before they can form by their synthesis what we know as the real Space of the objective world. In these operations, imagination, association, attention, and selection play a decisive part; and although they nowhere add any new material to the space-data of sense, they so shuffle and manipulate these data and hide present ones behind imagined ones that it is no wonder if some authors have gone so far as to think that the sense-data have no spatial worth at all, and that the intellect, since it makes the subdivisions, also gives the spatial quality to them out of resources of its own.\n\nAs for ourselves, having found that all our sensations (however as yet unconnected and undiscriminated) are of extensive objects, our next problem is: How do we ARRANGE these at first chaotically given spaces into the one regular and orderly world of space which we now know?\n\nTo begin with, there is no reason to suppose that the several sense-spaces of which a sentient creature may become conscious, each fined with its own peculiar content, should tend, simply because they are many, to enter into any definite spatial intercourse with each other, or lie in any particular order of positions. Even in ourselves we can recognize this. Different feelings may coexist in us without assuming any particular spatial order. The sound of the brook near which I write, the odor of the cedars, the comfort with which my breakfast has fined me, and my interest in this paragraph, all lie distinct in my consciousness, but in no sense outside or alongside of each other. Their spaces are interfused and at most fin the same vaguely objective world. Even where the qualities are far less disparate, we may have something similar. If me take our subjective and corporeal sensations alone, there are moments when, as we lie or sit motionless, we find it very difficult to feel distinctly the length of our back or the direction of our feet from our shoulders. By a strong effort we can succeed in dispersing our attention impartially over our whole person, and then we feel the real shape of our body in a sort of unitary way. But in general a few parts are strongly emphasized to consciousness and the rest sink out of notice; and it is then remarkable how vague and ambiguous our perception of their relative order of location is. Obviously, the orderly arrangement of a multitude of sense-spaces in consciousness, something more than their mere separate existence is required. What is this further condition?\n\nIf a number of sensible extents are to be perceived alongside of each other and in definite order they must appear as parts in a vaster sensible extent which can enter the mind simply and ad at once. I think it will be seen that the difficulty of estimating correctly the form of one's body by pure feeling arises from the fact that it is very hard to feel its totality as a unit at all. The trouble is similar to that of thinking forwards and backwards simultaneously. When conscious of our head we tend to grow unconscious of our feet, and there enters thus an element of time-succession into our perception of ourselves which transforms the latter from an act of intuition to one of construction. This element of constructiveness is present in a still higher degree, and carries with it the same consequences, when we deal with objective spaces too great to be grasped by a single look. The relative positions of the shops in a town, separated by many tortuous streets, have to be thus constructed from data apprehended in succession, and the result is a greater or less degree of vagueness.\n\nThat a sensation be discriminated as part from out of a, larger enveloping space is then the condition sine qu\u00e2 non of its being apprehended in a definite spatial order. The problem of ordering our feelings in space is then, in the first instance, a problem of discrimination, but not of discrimination pure and simple; for then not only coexistent sights but consistent sounds would necessarily assume web order, which they notoriously do not. Whatever is discriminated will appear as a small space within a larger space, it is true, but this is but the very rudiment of order. For the location of it within that space to become precise, other conditions still must supervene; and the best way to study what they are will be to pause for a little and analyze what the expression 'spatial order' means.\n\nSpatial order is an abstract term. The concrete perceptions which it covers are figures, directions, positions, magnitudes, and distances. To single out any one of these things from a total vastness is partially to introduce order into the vastness. To subdivide the vastness into a multitude of these things is to apprehend it in a completely orderly way. Now what are these things severally? To begin with, no one can for an instant hesitate to say that some of them are qualities of sensation, just as the total vastness is in which they lie. Take figure: a square, a circle, and a triangle appear in the best instance to the eye simply as three different kinds elf impressions, each so peculiar that we should recognize it if it were to return. When Nunnery's patient had his cataracts removed, and a cube and a sphere were presented to his notice, he could at once perceive a difference in their shapes; and though he could not say which was the cube and which the sphere, he saw they were not of the same figure. So of lines: if we can notice lines at all in our field of vision, it is inconceivable that a vertical one should not affect us differently from an horizontal one, and should not be recognized as affecting us similarly when presented again, although we might not yet know the name 'vertical,' or any of its connotations, beyond this peculiar affection of our sensibility. So of angles: an obtuse one affects our feeling immediately in a different way from an acute one. Distance-apart, too, is a simple sensation -- the sensation of a line joining the two distant points: lengthen the line, you alter the feeling and with it the distance felt.\n\nSpace-relations.\n\nBut with distance and direction we pass to the category of space-relations, and are immediately confronted by an opinion which makes of all relations something tote coelo different from all facts of feeling or imagination whatsoever. A relation, for the Platonizing school in psychology, is an energy of pure thought, and, as such, is quite incommensurable with the data of sensibility between which it may be perceived to obtain. We may consequently imagine a disciple of this school to say to us at this point: \"Suppose you have made a, separate specific sensation of each line and each angle, what boots it? You have still the order of directions and of distances to account for; you have still the relative magnitudes of all these felt figures to state; you have their respective positions to define before you can be said to have brought order into your space. And not one of these de- terminations can be effected except through an act of relating thought, so that your attempt to give an account of space in terms of pure sensibility breaks down almost at the very outset. Position, for example, can never be a sensation, for it has nothing intrinsic about it; it can only obtain between a spot, line, or other figure and extraneous coordinates, and can never be an element of the sensible datum, the line or the spot, in itself. Let us then confess that Thought alone can unlock the riddle of space, and that Thought is an adorable but unfathomable mystery. Such a method of dealing with the problem has the merit of shortness. Let us, however, be in no such hurry, but see whether we cannot get a little deeper by patiently considering what these space-relations are.\n\n'Relation' is a very slippery word. It has so many different concrete meanings that the use of it as an abstract universal may easily introduce bewilderment into our thought. We must therefore be careful to avoid ambiguity by making sure, wherever we have to employ it, what its precise meaning is in that particular sphere of application. At present we have to do with space-relations, and no others. Most 'relations' are feelings of an entirely different order from the terms they relate. The relation of similarity, e.g., may equally obtain between jasmine and tuberose, or between Mr. Browning's verses and Mr. Story's; it is itself neither odorous nor poetical, and those may well be pardoned who have denied to it all sensational content whatever. But just as, in the field of quantity, the relation between two numbers is another number, so in the field of space the relations are facts of the same order with the facts they relate. If these latter be catches in the circle of vision, the former are certain other patches between them. When we speak of the relation of direction of two points toward each other, we mean simply the sensation of the line that joins the two points together. The line is the relation; feel it and you feel the relation, see it and you see the relation; nor call you in any conceivable way think the latter except by imagining the former (however vaguely), or describe or indicate the one except by pointing to the other. And the moment you have imagined the line, the relation stands before you in all its completeness, with nothing further to be done. Just so the relation of direction between two lines is identical with the peculiar sensation of shape of the space enclosed between them. This is commonly called an angular relation.\nIf these relations are sensations, no less so are the relations of position. The relation of position between the top and bottom points of a vertical line is that line, and nothing else. The relations of position between a point and a horizontal line below it are potentially numerous. There is one more important than the rest, called its distance. This is the sensation, ideal or actual, of a perpendicular drawn from the point to the line. [16] Two lines, one from each extremity of the horizontal to the point, give us a peculiar sensation of triangularity. This feeling may be said to constitute the locus of all the relations of position of the elements in question. Rightness and leftness, upness and downness, are again pure sensations differing specifically from each other, and generically from everything else. Like all sensations, they can only be indicated, not described. If we take a cube and label one side top, another bottom, a third front, and a fourth back; there remains no form of words by which we can describe to another person which of the remaining sides is right and which left. We can only point and say here is right and there is left, just as we should say this is red and that blue. Of two points seen beside each other at all, one is always affected by one of these feelings, and the other by the opposite; the same is true of the extremities of any line. [17]\n\nThus it appears indubitable that all space-relations except those of magnitude are nothing more or less than pure sensational objects. But magnitude appears to outstep this narrow sphere. We hare relations of muchness and littleness between times, numbers, intensities, and qualities, as well as spaces. It is impossible, then, that such relations should form a particular kind of simply spatial feeling. This we must admit: the relation of quantity is generic and occurs in many categories of consciousness, whilst the other relations we have considered are specific and occur in space alone. When our attention passes from a shorter line to a longer, from a smaller spot to a larger, from a, feebler light to a stronger, from a paler blue to a richer, from a march tune to a galop, the transition is accompanied in the synthetic field of consciousness by a peculiar feeling of difference which is what we call the sensation of more, -- more length, more expense, more light, more blue, more motion. This transitional sensation of more must Be identical with itself under all these different accompaniments, or me should not give it the same name in every case. We get it when we pass from a short vertical line to a long horizontal one, from a small square to a large circle, as well as when we pass between those figures whose shapes are congruous. But when the shapes are congruous our consciousness of the relation is a good deal more distinct, and it is most distinct of all when, in the exercise of our analytic attention, we notice, first, a part, and then the whole, of a single line or shape. Then the more of the whole actually sticks out, as a separate piece of space, and is so envisaged. The same exact sensation of it is given when we are able to superpose one line or figure on another. This indispensable condition of exact measurement of the more has led some to think that the feeling itself arose in every case from original experiences of superposition. This is probably not an absolutely true opinion, but for our present purpose that is immaterial. So far as the subdivisions of a, sense-space are to be measured exactly against each other, objective forms occupying one subdivision must directly or indirectly be superposed upon the other, and the mind must get the immediate feeling of an outstanding plus. And even where we only feel one subdivision to be vaguely larger or less, the mind must pass rapidly between it and the other subdivision, and receive the immediate sensible shock of the more.\n\nWe seem thus to have accounted for all space-relations, and made them clear to our understanding. They are nothing but sensations of particular lines, particular angles, particular forms of transition, or (in the case of a distinct more) of particular outstanding portions of space after two figures have been superposed. These relation-sensations may actually be produced as such, as when a geometer draws new lines across a figure with his pencil to demonstrate the relations of its parts, or they may be ideal representations of lines, not really drawn. But in either case their entrance into the mind is equivalent to a more detailed subdivision, cognizance, and measurement of the space considered. The bringing of sub-divisions to consciousness constitutes, then, the entire process by which we pass from our first vague feeling of a total vastness to a cognition of the vastness in detail. The more numerous the subdivisions are, the more elaborate and perfect the cognition becomes. But inasmuch as all the sub-divisions are themselves sensations, and even the feeling of 'more' or 'less' is, where not itself a figure, at least a sensation of transition between two sensations of figure, it follows, for aught we can as yet see to the contrary, that all spatial knowledge is sensational at bottom, and that, as the sensations lie together in the unity of consciousness, no new material element whatever comes to them from a supra-sensible source. [18]\n\nThe bringing of subdivisions to consciousness! This, then, is our next topic. They may be brought to consciousness under three aspects in respect of their locality, in respect of their size, in respect of their shape.\n\nThe Meaning of Localization.\n\nConfining ourselves to the problem of locality for the present, let us begin with the simple case of a sensitive surface, only two points of which receive stimulation from without. How, first, are these two points felt as alongside of each other with an interval of space between them? We must be conscious of two things for this: of the duality of the excited points, and of the extensiveness of the unexcited interval. The duality alone, although a necessary, is not a sufficient condition of the spatial separation. We may, for instance, discern two sounds in the same place, sweet and sour in the same lemonade, warm and cold, round and pointed contact in the same place on the skin, etc. [19] In all discrimination the recognition of the duality of two feelings by the mind is the easier the more strongly the feelings are contrasted in quality. If our two excited points awaken identical qualities of sensation, they must, perforce, appear to the mind as one; and, not distinguished at all, they are, a fortiori, not localized apart. Spots four centimetres distant on the back have no qualitative contrast at all, and fuse into a single sensation. Points less than three thousandths of a millimetre apart awaken on the retina sensations so contrasted that we apprehend them immediately as two. Now these unlikenesses which arise so slowly when we pass from one point to another in the back, so much faster on the tongue and finger-tips, but with such inconceivable rapidity on the retina, what are they? Can we discover anything about their intrinsic nature?\n\nThe most natural and immediate answer to make is that they are unlikeness of place pure and simple. In the words of the German physiologist [20] to who psychophysics owes much:\n\n\" The sensations are from the outset (von vornherein) localized.... Every sensation as such is from the very beginning affected with the spatial quality, so that this quality is nothing like an external attribute coming to the sensation from a higher faculty, but must be regarded as something immanently residing in the sensation itself.\"\n\nAnd yet the moment we reflect on this answer an insuperable logical difficulty seems to present itself. No single quail of sensation can, by itself, amount to a consciousness of position. Suppose no feeling but that of a single point ever to be awakened. Could that possibly be the feeling of any special whereness or thereness? Certainly not. Only when a second point is felt to arise can the first one acquire a determination of up, down, right or left, and these determinations are all relative to that second point. Each point, so far as it is placed, is then only by virtue of what it is not, namely, by virtue of another point. This is as much as to say that position has nothing intrinsic about it; and that, although a feeling of absolute bigness may, a feeling of place cannot, possibly form an immanent element in any single isolated sensation. The very writer we have quoted has given heed to this objection, for he continues (p. 335) by saying that the sensations thus originally localized \"are only so in themselves, but not in the representation of consciousness, which is not yet present.... They are, in the first instance, devoid of all mutual relations with each other.\" But such a localization of the sensation 'in itself' would seem to mean nothing more than the susceptibility or potentiality of being distinctly localized when the time came and other conditions became fulfilled. Can we now discover anything about such susceptibility in itself before it has borne its ulterior fruits in the developed consciousness?\n\n'Local Signs.'\n\nTo begin with, every sensation of the skin and every visceral sensation seems to derive from its topographic seat a peculiar shade of feeling, which it would not have in another place. And this feeling per se seems quite another thing from the perception of the place. Says Wundt: [21]\n\n\"If with the finger we touch first the cheek and then the palm, exerting each time precisely the same pressure, the sensation shows notwithstanding a distinctly marked difference in the two cases. Similarly, when we compare the palm with the back of the hand, the nape of the neck with its anterior surface, the breast with the back; in short, any two distant parts of the skin with each other. and moreover, we easily remark, by attentively observing, that spots even tolerably close together differ in respect of the quality of their feeling. If we pass from one point of our cutaneous surface to another, we find a perfectly gradual and continuous alteration in our feeling, notwithstanding the objective nature of the contact has remained the same. Even the sensations of corresponding points on opposite sides of the body, though similar, are not identical. If, for instance, we touch first the back of one hand and then of the other, we remark a qualitative unlikeness of sensation. It must not be thought that such differences are mere matters of imagination, and that we take the sensations to be different because we represent each of them to ourselves as occupying a different place. With sufficient sharpening of the attention, we may, confining ourselves to the quality of the feelings alone, entirely abstract from their locality, and yet notice the differences quite as markedly.\"\n\nWhether these local contrasts shade into each other with absolutely continuous gradations, we cannot say. But we know (continues Wundt) that\n\n\"they change, when we pass from one point of the skin to its neighbor, with very different degrees of rapidity. On delicately-feeling parts, used principally for touching, such as the finger-tips, the difference of sensation between two closely approximate points is already strongly pronounced; whilst in parts of lesser delicacy, as the arm, the back, the legs, the disparities of sensation are observable only between distant spots.\"\n\nThe internal organs, too, have their specific qualia of sensation. An inflammation of the kidney is different from one of the liver; pains in joints and muscular insertions are distinguished. Pain in the dental nerves is wholly unlike the pain of a burn. But very important and curious similarities prevail throughout these differences. Internal pains, whose seat we cannot see, and have no means of knowing unless the character of the pain itself reveal it, are felt where they belong. Diseases of the stomach, kidney, liver, rectum, prostate, etc., of the bones, of the brain and its membranes, are referred to their proper position. Nerve-pains describe the length of the nerve. Such localizations as those of vertical, frontal, or occipital headache of intracranial origin force us to conclude that parts which are neighbors, whether inner or outer, may possess by mere virtue of that fact a common peculiarity of feeling, a respect in which their sensations agree, and which serves as a token of their proximity. These local colorings are, moreover, so strong that we cognize them as the same, throughout all contrasts of sensible quality in the accompanying perception. Cold and heat are wide as the poles asunder; yet if both fall on the cheek, there mixes with them something that makes them in that respect identical; just as, contrariwise, despite the identity of cold with itself wherever found, when we get it first on the palm and then on the cheek, some difference comes, which keeps the two experiences for ever asunder.\" [22]\n\nAnd now let us revert to the query propounded a, moment since: Can these differences of mere quality in feeling, varying according to locality yet having each sensibly and intrinsically and by itself nothing to do with position, constitute the 'susceptibilities' we mentioned, the conditions of being perceived in position, of the localities to which they belong? The numbers on a row of houses, the initial letters of a set of words, have no intrinsic kinship with points of space, and yet they are the conditions of our knowledge of where any house is in the row, or any word in the dictionary. Can the modifications of feeling in question be tags or labels of this kind which in no wise originally reveal the position of the spot to which they are attached, but guide us to it by what Berkeley would call a 'customary tie'? Many authors have unhesitatingly replied in the affirmative; Lotze, who in his Medzinische Psychologie [23] first described the sensations in this way, designating them, thus conceived, as local-signs. This term has obtained wide currency in Germany, and in speaking of the 'LOCAL-SIGN THEORY' hereafter, I shall always mean the theory which denies that there can be in a sensation any element of actual locality, of inherent spatial order, any tone as it were which cries to us immediately and without further ado, 'I am here,' or 'I am there.' If, as may well be the case, we by this time and ourselves tempted to accept the Local-sign theory in a general way, we have to clear up several farther matters. If a sign is to lead us to the thing it means, we must have some other source of knowledge of that thing. Either the thing has been given in a previous experience of which the sign also formed part-they are associated ; or it is what Reid calls a 'natural' sign, that is, a feeling which, the first time it enters the mind, evokes from the native powers thereof a cognition of the thing that hitherto had lain dormant. In both cases, however, the sign is one thing, and the thing another. In the instance that now concerns us, the sign is a quality of feeling and the thing is a position. Now we have seen that the position of a point is not only revealed, but created, by the existence of other points to which it stands in determinate relations. If the sign can by any machinery which it sets in motion evoke consciousness either of the other points, or of the relations, or of both, it would seem to fulfil its function, and reveal to us the position we seek.\n\nBut such a machinery is already familiar to us. It is neither more nor less than the law of habit in the nervous system. When any point of the sensitive surface has been frequently excited simultaneously with, or immediately before or after, other points, and afterwards comes to be excited alone, there will be A tendency for its perceptive nerve-centre to irradiate into the nerve-centres of the other points. Subjectively considered, this is the same as if we said that the peculiar feeling of the first point SUGGESTS the feeling of the entire region with whose stimulation its own excitement has been habitually ASSOCIATED.\n\nTake the case of the stomach. When the epigastrium is heavily pressed, when certain muscles contract, etc., the stomach is squeezed, and its peculiar local sign awakes in consciousness simultaneously with the local signs of the other squeezed parts. There is also a sensation of total vastness aroused by the combined irritation, and somewhere in this the stomach-feeling seems to lie. Suppose that later a pain arises in the stomach from some non-mechani- cal cause. It will be tinged by the gastric local sign, and the nerve-centre supporting this latter feeling will excite the centre supporting the dermal and muscular feelings habitually associated with it when the excitement was mechanical. From the combination the same peculiar vastness will again arise. In a word, 'something' in the stomach-sensation 'reminds' us of a total space, of which the diaphragmatic and epigastric sensations also form a part, or, to express it more briefly still, suggests the neighborhood of these latter organs. [24]\n\nRevert to the case of two excited points on a surface with an unexcited space between them. The general result of previous experience has been that when either point was impressed by an outward object, the same object also touched the immediately neighboring parts. Each point, together with its local sign, is thus associated with a circle of surrounding points, the association fading in strength as the circle grows larger. Each will revive its own circle; but when both are excited together, the strongest revival will be that due to the combined irradiation. Now the tract joining the two excited points is the only part common to the two circles. And the feelings of this whole tract will therefore awaken with considerable vividness in the imagination when its extremities are touched by an outward irritant. The mind receives with the impression of the two distinct points the vague idea of a line. The twoness of the points comes from the contrast of their local signs: the line comes from the associations into which experience has wrought these latter. If no ideal line arises me have duality without sense of interval; if the line be excited actually rather than ideally, we have the interval given with its ends, in the form of a single extended object felt. E. H. Weber, in the famous article in which he laid the foundations of all our accurate knowledge of these subjects, laid it down as the logical requisite for the perception of two separated points, that the mind should, along with its consciousness of them, become aware of an unexcited interval as such I have only tried to show how the known laws of experience may cause this requisite to be fulfilled. Of course, if the local signs of the entire region offer but little qualitative contrast inter se, the line suggested will be but dimly defined or discriminated in length or direction from other possible lines in its neighborhood. This is what happens in the back, where consciousness can sunder two spots, whilst only vaguely apprehending their distance and direction apart.\n\nThe relation of position of the two points is the suggested interval or line. Turn now to the simplest case, that of a single excited spot. How can it suggest its position? Not by recalling any particular line unless experience have constantly been in the habit of marking or tracing some one line from it towards some one neighboring point. Now on the back, belly, viscera, etc., no such tracing habitually occurs. The consequence is that the only suggestion is that of the whole neighboring circle; i.e., the spot simply recalls the general region in which it happens to lie. By a process of successive construction, it is quite true that we can also get the feeling of distance between the spot and some other particular spot. Attention, by reinforcing the local sign of one part of the circle, can awaken a new circle round this part, and so de proche en proche we may slide our feeling down from our cheek, say, to our foot. But when we first touched our cheek we had no consciousness of the foot at all. [25] In the extremities, the lips, the tongue and other mobile parts, the case is different. We there have an instinctive tendency, when a, part of lesser discriminative sensibility is touched, to move the member so that the touching object glides along it to the place where sensibility is greatest. If a body touches our hand we move the hand over it tin the finger-tips are able to explore it. If the sole of our foot touches anything we bring it towards the toes, and so forth. There thus arise lines of habitual passage from all points of a member to its sensitive tip. These are the lines most readily recalled when any point is touched, and their recall is identical with the consciousness of the distance of the touched point from the 'tip.' I think anyone must be aware when he touches a point of his hand or wrist that it is the relation to the finger-tips of which he is usually most conscious. Points on the fore-arm suggest either the finger-tips or the elbow (the latter being a spot of greater sensibility [26] ). In the foot it is the toes, and so on. A point can only be cognized in its relations to the entire body at once by awakening a visual image of the whole body. Such awakening is even more obviously than the previously considered cases a matter of pure association.\n\nThis leads us to the eye. On the retina the fovea and the yellow spot about it form a focus of exquisite sensibility, towards which every impression falling on an outlying portion of the field is moved by an instinctive action of the muscles of the eyeball. Few persons, until their attention is called to the fact, are aware how almost impossible it is to keep a conspicuous visible abject in the margin of the field of view. The moment volition is relaxed we find that without our knowing it our eyes have turned so as to bring it to the centre. This is why most persons are unable to keep the eyes steadily converged upon a point in space with nothing in it. The objects against the walls of the room invincibly attract the fove\u00e6 to themselves. If we contemplate a blank wall or sheet of paper, we always observe in a moment that we are directly looking at some speck upon it which, unnoticed at first, ended by 'catching our eye.' Thus whenever an image falling on the point P of the retina excites attention, it more habitually moves from that point towards the fovea than in any one other direction. The line traced thus by the image is not always a straight line. When the direction of the point from the fovea is neither vertical nor horizontal but oblique, the line traced is often a curve, with its concavity directed upwards if the direction is upwards, downwards if the direction is downwards. This may be verified by anyone who will take the trouble to make a simple experiment with a luminous body like a candle-flame in a dark enclosure, or a star. Gazing first at some point remote from the source of light, let the eye be suddenly turned full upon the latter. The luminous image will necessarily fall in succession upon a continuous series of points, reaching from the one first affected to the fovea. But by virtue of the slowness with which retinal excitements die away, the entire series of points will for an instant be visible as an after-image, displaying the above peculiarity of form according to its situation. [27] These radiating lines are neither regular nor invariable in the same person, nor, probably, equally curved in different individuals. We are incessantly drawing them between the fovea and every point of the held of view. Objects remain in their peripheral indistinctness only so long as they are unnoticed. The moment we attend to them they grow distinct through one of these motions -- which leads to the idea prevalent among uninstructed persons that we see distinctly all parts of the field of view at once. The result of this incessant tracing of radii is that whenever a local sign P is awakened by a spot of light falling upon it, it recalls forthwith, even though the eyeball be unmoved, the local signs of all the other points which lie between P and the fovea. It recalls them in imaginary form, just as the normal reflex movement would recall them in vivid form; and with their recall is given a consciousness more or less faint of the whole line on which they lie. In other words, no ray of light can fall on any retinal spot without the local sign of that spot revealing to us, by recalling the line of its most habitual associates, its direction and distance from the centre of the held. The fovea acts thus as the origin of a system of polar co-ordinates, in relation to which each and every retinal point has through an incessantly-repeated process of association its distance and direction determined. Were P alone illumined and all the rest of the field dark we should still, even with motionless eyes, know whether P lay high or low, right or left, through the ideal streak, different from all other streaks, which P alone has the power of awakening.\" [28]\n\nAnd with this we can close the first great division of our subject. We have shown that, within the range of every sense, experience takes ab initio the spatial form. We have also shown that in the cases of the retina and skin every sensible total may be subdivided by discriminative attention into sensible parts, which are also spaces, and into relations between the parts, these being sensible spaces too. Furthermore, we have seen (in a foot-note) that different parts, once discriminated, necessarily fall into a determinate order, both by reason of definite gradations in their quality, and by reason of the fixed order of time-succession in which movements arouse them. But in all this nothing has been said of the comparative measurement of one sensible space-total against another, or of the way in which, by summing our divers simple sensible space-experiences together, we end by constructing what we regard as the unitary, continuous, and infinite objective space of the real world. To this more difficult inquiry we next pass.\n\nTHE CONSTRUCTION OF 'REAL' SPACE.\n\nThe problem breaks into two subordinate problems.\n\n(1) How is the subdivision and measurement of the several sensorial spaces completely effected? and\n\n(2) How do their mutual addition and fusion and reduction to the same scale, in a word, how does their synthesis, occur?\n\nI think that, as in the investigation just finished, we found ourselves able to get along without invoking any data but those that pure sensibility on the one hand, and the ordinary intellectual powers of discrimination and recollec- tion on the other, were able to yield; so here we shall emerge from our more complicated quest with the conviction that all the facts can be accounted for on the supposition that no other mental forces have been at work save those we find everywhere else in psychology: sensibility, namely, for the data; and discrimination, association, memory, and choice for the rearrangements and combinations which they undergo.\n\n1. The Subdivision of the Original Sense-spaces.\n\nHow are spatial subdivisions brought to consciousness ? in other words, How does spatial discrimination occur? The general subject of discrimination has been treated in a previous chapter. Here we need only inquire what are the conditions that make spatial discrimination so much finer in sight than in touch, and in touch than in hearing, smell, or taste.\n\nThe first great condition is, that different points of the surface shall differ in the quality of their immanent sensibility, that is, that each shall carry its special local-sign. If the skin felt everywhere exactly alike, a foot-bath could be distinguished from a total immersion, as being smaller, but never distinguished from a wet face. The local-signs are indispensable; two points which have the same local-sign will always be felt as the same point. We do not judge them two unless we have discerned their sensations to be different. [29] Granted none but homogeneous irritants, that organ would then distinguish the greatest multiplicity of irritants -- would count most stars or compass-points, or best compare the size of two wet surfaces -- whose local sensibility was the least even. A skin whose sensibility shaded rapidly off from a focus, like the apex of a boil, would be better than a homogeneous integument for spatial perception. The retina, with its exquisitely sensitive fovea, has this peculiarity, and undoubtedly owes to it a great part of the minuteness with which we are able to subdivide the total bigness of the sensation it yields. On its periphery the local differences do not shade off very rapidly, and we can count there fewer subdivisions.\n\nBut these local differences of feeling, so long as the surface is unexcited from without, are almost null. I cannot feel them by a pure mental act of attention unless they belong to quite distinct parts of the body, as the nose and the lip, the finger-tip and the ear; their contrast needs the reinforcement of outward excitement to be felt. In the spatial muchness of a colic -- or, to call it by the more spacious-sounding vernacular, of a 'bellyache' -- one can with difficulty distinguish the north-east from the south-west corner, but can do so much more easily if, by pressing one's finger against the former region, one is able to make the pain there more intense.\n\nThe local differences require then, an adventitious sensation, superinduced upon them, to awaken the attention. After the attention has once been awakened in this way, it may continue to be conscious of the unaided difference; lust as a sail on the horizon may be too faint for us to notice until someone's finger, placed against the spot, has pointed it out to us, but may then remain visible after the finger has been withdrawn. But all this is true only on condition that separate points of the surface may be exclusively stimulated. If the whole surface at once be excited from without, and homogeneously, as, for example, by immersing the body in salt water, local discrimination is not furthered. The local signs, it is true, all awaken at once; but in such multitude that no one of them, with its specific quality, stands out in contrast with the rest. If, however, a single extremity be immersed, the contrast between the wet and dry parts is strong, and, at the surface of the water especially, the local-signs attract the attention, giving the feeling of a ring surrounding the member. Similarly, two or three wet spots separated by dry spots, or two or three hard points against the skin, will help to break up our consciousness of the latter's bigness. In eases of this sort, where points receiving an identical kind of excitement are, nevertheless, felt to be locally distinct, and the objective irritants are also judged multiple, -- e.g., compass-points on skin or stars on retina, -- the ordinary explanation is no doubt just, and we judge the outward causes to be multiple because we have discerned the local feelings of their sensations to be different.\n\nCapacity for partial stimulation is thus the second condition favoring discrimination. A sensitive surface which has to be excited in all its parts at once can yield nothing but a sense of undivided largeness. This appears to be the case with the olfactory, and to all intents and purposes with the gustatory, surfaces. Of many tastes and flavors, even simultaneously presented, each affects the totality of its respective organ, each appears with the whole vastness given by that organ, and appears interpenetrated by the rest. [30]\n\nI should have been wining some years ago to name with- out hesitation a third condition of discrimination-saying it would be most developed in that organ which is susceptible of the most various qualities of feeling. The retina is un- questionably such an organ. The colors and shades it perceives are infinitely more numerous than the diversities of skin-sensation. And it can feel at once white and black, whilst the ear can in nowise so feel sound and silence. But the late researches of Donaldson, Blix, and Goldscheider, [31] on specific points for heat, cold, pressure, and pain in the skin; the older ones of Czermak (repeated later by Klug in Ludwig's laboratory), showing that a hot and a cold compass-point are no more easily discriminated as two than two of equal temperature; and some unpublished experiments of my own -- all disincline me to make much of this condition now. [32] There is, however, one quality of sensa- tion which is particularly exciting, and that is the feeling of motion over any of our surfaces. The erection of this into a separate elementary quality of sensibility is one of the most recent of psychological achievements, and is worthy of detaining us a while at this point.\n\nThe Sensation of Motion over Surfaces.\n\nThe feeling of motion has generally been assumed by physiologists to be impossible until the positions of terminus ad quem and terminus ad quem are severally cognized, and the successive occupancies of these positions by the moving body are perceived to be separated by a distinct interval of time. [33] As a matter of fact, however, we cognize only the very slowest motions in this way. Seeing the hand of a clock at XII and afterwards at VI, we judge that it has moved through the interval. Seeing the sun now in the east and again in the west, I infer it to have passed over my head. But we can only infer that which we already generically know in some more direct fashion, and it is experimentally certain that we have the feeling of motion given us as a direct and simple sensation. Czermak long ago pointed out the difference between seeing the motion of the second-hand of a watch, when we look directly at it, and noticing the fact of its having altered its position when we fix our gaze upon some other point of the dial-plate. In the first case we have a specific quality of sensation which is absent in the second. If the reader will find a portion of his skin -- the arm, for example -- where a pair of compass-points an inch apart are felt as one impression, and if he will then trace lines a tenth of an inch long on that spot with a pencil-point, he will be distinctly aware of the point's motion and vaguely aware of the direction of the motion. The perception of the motion here is certainly not derived from a pre-existing knowledge that its starting and ending points are separate positions in space, because positions in space ten times wider apart fail to be discriminated as such when excited by the dividers. It is the same with the retina. One's fingers when cast upon its peripheral portions cannot be counted -- that is to say, the five retinal tracts which they occupy are not distinctly apprehended by the mind as five separate positions in space -- and yet the slightest movement of the fingers is most vividly perceived as movement and nothing else. It is thus certain that our sense of movement, being so much more delicate than our sense of position, cannot possibly be derived from it. A curious observation by Exner [34] completes the proof that movement in a primitive form of sensibility, by showing it to be much more delicate than our sense of succession in time. This very able physiologist caused two electric sparks to appear in rapid succession, one beside the other. The observer had to state whether the right-hand one or the left-hand one appeared first. When the interval was reduced to as short a time as 0.044\" the discrimination of temporal order in the sparks became impossible. But Exner found that if the sparks were brought so close together in space that their irradiation-circles overlapped, the eye then felt their flashing as if it were the motion of a single spark from the point occupied by the first to the point occupied by the second, and the time-interval might then be made as small as 0.015\" before the mind began to be in doubt as to whether the apparent motion started from the right or from the left. On the skin similar experiments gave similar results.\n\nVierordt, at almost the same time, [35] called attention to certain persistent illusions, amongst which are these: If another person gently trace a line across our wrist or finger, the latter being stationary, it will feel to us as if the member were moving in the opposite direction to the tracing point. If, on the contrary, we move our limb across a fixed point, it will be seen as if the point were moving as well. If the reader will touch his forehead with his forefinger kept motionless, and then rotate the head so that the skin of the forehead passes beneath the finger's tip, he will have an irresistible sensation of the latter being itself in motion in the opposite direction to the head. So in abducting the fingers from each other; some may move and the rest be still still, but the still ones will feel as if they were actively separating from the rest. These illusions, according to Vierordt, are survivals of a primitive form of perception, when motion was felt as such, but ascribed to the whole content of consciousness, and not yet distinguished as belonging exclusively to one of its parts. When our perception is fully developed we go beyond the mere relative motion of thing and Bound, and can ascribe absolute motion to one of these components of our total object, and absolute rest to another. When, in vision for example, the whole background moves together, we think that it is ourselves or our eyes which are moving; and any object in the foregound which may move relatively to the background is judged by us to be still. But primitively this discrimination cannot be perfectly made. The sensation of the motion spreads over all that we see and infects it. Any relative motion of object and retina both makes the object seem to move, and makes us feel ourselves in motion. Even now when our whole object moves we still get giddy; and we still see an apparent motion of the entire held of view, whenever we suddenly jerk our head and eyes or shake them quickly to and fro. Pushing our eyeballs gives the same illusion. We know in all these cases what really happens, but the conditions are unusual, so our primitive sensation persists unchecked. So it does when clouds float by the moon. We know the moon is still; but we see it move even faster than the clouds. Even when we slowly move our eyes the primitive sensation persists under the victorious conception. If we notice closely the experience, we find that any object towards which we look appears moving to meet our eye. But the most valuable contribution to the subject is the paper of G. H. Schneider, [36] who takes up the matter zoologically, and shows by examples from every branch of the animal kingdom that movement is the quality by which animals most easily attract each other's attention. The in- stinct of shamming death 'is no shamming of death at all, but rather a paralysis through fear, which saves the insect, crustacean, or other creature from being noticed at all by his enemy. It is paralleled in the human race by the breath-holding stillness of the boy playing 'I spy,' to whom the seeker is near; and its obverse side is shown in our involuntary waving of arms, jumping up and down, and so forth, when we wish to attract someone's attention at a distance. Creatures 'stalking' their prey and creatures hiding from their pursuers alike show how immobility diminishes conspicuity. In the woods, if we are quiet, the squirrels and birds will actually touch us. Flies will light on stuffed birds and stationary frogs. [37] On the other hand, the tremendous shock of feeling the thing we are sitting on begin to move, the exaggerated start it gives us to have an insect unexpectedly pass over our skin, or a cat noiselessly come and snuffle about our hand, the excessive reflex effects of tickling, etc., show how exciting the sensation of motion is per se. A kitten cannot help pursuing a moving ball. Impressions too faint to be cognized at all are immediately felt if they move. A fly sitting is unnoticed, -- we feel it the moment it crawls. A shadow may be too faint to be perceived. As soon as it moves, however, we see it. Schneider found that a shadow, with distinct outline, and directly fixated, could still be perceived when moving, although its objective strength might be but half as great as that of a stationary shadow so faint as just to disappear. With a blurred shadow in indirect vision the difference in favor of motion was much greater -- namely, 13.3:40.7. If me hold a finger between our closed eyelid and the sunshine we shall not notice its presence. The moment we move it to and fro, however, we discern it. Such visual perception as this reproduces the conditions of sight among the radiates. [38]\n\nEnough has now been said to show that in the education of spatial discrimination the motions of impressions across sensory surfaces must have been the principal agent in breaking up our consciousness of the surfaces into a consciousness of their parts. Even to-day the main function of the peripheral regions of our retina is that of sentinels, which, when beams of light move over them, cry 'Who goes there ?' and call the fovea to the spot. Most parts of the skin do but perform the same of office for the finger-tips. Of course finger-tips and fovea leave some power of direct perception to marginal retina and skin respectively. But it is worthy of note that such perception is best developed on the skin of the most movable parts (the labors of Vierordt and his pupils have well shown this); and that in the blind, whose skin is exceptionally discriminative, it seems to have become so through the inveterate habit which most of them possess of twitching and moving it under whatever object may touch them, so as to become better acquainted with the con- formation of the same. Czermak was the first to notice this. It may be easily verified. Of course movement of surface under object is (for purposes of stimulation) equivalent to movement of object over surface. In exploring the shapes and sizes of things by either eye or skin the movements of these organs are incessant and unrestrainable. Every such movement draws the points and lines of the object across the surface, imprints them a hundred times more sharply, and drives them home to the attention. The immense part thus played by movements in our perceptive activity is held by many psychologists [39] to prove that the muscles are themselves the space-perceiving organ. Not surface-sensibility, but 'the muscular sense,' is for these writers the original and only revealer of objective extension. But they have all failed to notice with what peculiar intensity muscular contractions call surface-sensibilities into play, and that the mere discrimination of impressions (quite apart from any question of measuring the space between them) largely depends on the mobility of the surface upon which they fall. [40]\n\n2. The Measurement of the sense-spaces against each other.\n\nWhat precedes is all we can say in answer to the problem of discrimination. Turn now to that of measurement of the several spaces against each other, that being the first step in our constructing out of our diverse space-experiences the one space we believe in as that of the real world.\n\nThe first thing that seems evident is that we have no immediate power of comparing together with any accuracy the extents revealed by different sensations. Our mouth-cavity feels indeed to itself smaller, and to the tongue larger, than it feels to the finger or eye, our tympanic membrane feels larger than our finger-tip, our lips feel larger then a surface equal to them on our thigh. So much comparison is immediate; but it is vague; and for anything exact; we must resort to other help.\n\nThe great agent in comparing the extent felt by one sensory surface with that felt by another, is superposition-superposition of one surface upon another, and superposition of one outer thing upon many surfaces. Thus are exact equivalencies and common measures introduced, and the way prepared for numerical results.\n\nCould we not superpose one part of our skin upon another, or one object on both parts, we should hardly succeed in coming to that knowledge of our own form which we possess. The original differences of bigness of our different parts would remain vaguely operative, and we should have no certainty as to how much lip was equivalent to so much forehead, how much finger to so much back.\n\nBut with the power of exploring one part of the surface by another we get a direct perception of cutaneous equivalencies. The primitive differences of bigness are over-powered when we feel by an immediate sensation that a certain length of thigh-surface is in contact with the entire palm and fingers. And when a motion of the opposite finger-tips draws a line first along this same length of thigh and then along the whole of the hand in question, we get a new manner of measurement, less direct but confirming the equivalencies established by the first. In these ways, by superpositions of parts and by tracing lines on different parts by identical movements, a person deprived of sight can soon learn to reduce all the dimensions of his body to a homogeneous scale. By applying the same methods to objects of his own size or smaller, he can with equal ease make himself acquainted with their extension stated in terms derived from his own bulk, palms, feet, cubits, spans, paces, fathoms (armspreads), etc. In these reductions it is to be noticed that when the resident sensations of largeness of two opposed surfaces conflict, one of the sensations is chosen as the true standard and the other treated as illusory. Thus an empty tooth-socket is believed to be really smaller than the finger-tip which it will not admit, although it may feel larger; and in general it may be said that the hand, as the almost exclusive organ of palpation, gives its own magnitude to the other parts, instead of having its size determined by them. In general, it is, as Fechner says, the extent felt by the more sensitive part to which the other extents are reduced. [41]\n\nBut even though exploration of one surface by another were impossible, we could always measure our various surfaces against each other by applying the same extended object first to one and then to another. We should of course have the alternative of supposing that the object itself waxed and waned as it glided from one place to another (cf. above, p. 141); but the principle of simplifying as much as possible our world would soon drive us out of that assumption into the easier one that objects as a rule keep their sizes, and that most of our sensations are affected by errors for which a constant allowance must be made.\n\nIn the retina there is no reason to suppose that the bignesses of two impressions (lines or blotches) falling on different regions are primitively felt to stand in any exact mutual ratio. It is only when the impressions come from the same object that we judge their sizes to be the same. And this, too, only when the relation of the object to the eye is believed to be on the whole unchanged. When the object by moving changes its relations to the eye the sensation excited by its image even on the same retinal region becomes so fluctuating that we end by ascribing no absolute import whatever to the retinal space-feeling which at any moment we may receive. So complete does this overlooking of retinal magnitude become that it is next to impossible to compare the visual magnitudes of objects at different distances without making the experiment of superposition. We cannot say beforehand how much of a distant house or tree our finger will cover. The various answers to the familiar question, How large is the moon? -- answers which vary from a cartwheel to a wafer -- illustrate this most strikingly. The hardest part of the training of a young draughtsman is his learning to feel directly the retinal (i.e. primitively sensible) magnitudes which the different objects in the held of view subtend. To do this he must recover what Ruskin calls the 'innocence of the eye' -- that is, a sort of childish perception of stains of color merely as such, without consciousness of what they mean. With the rest of us this innocence is lost. Out of all the visual magnitudes of each known object we have selected one as the REAL one to think of, and degraded all the others to serve as its signs. This 'real' magnitude is determined by aesthetic and practical interests. It is that which we get when the object is at the distance most propitious for exact visual discrimination of its details. This is the distance at which we hold anything we are examining. Farther than this we see it too smell, nearer too large. And the larger and the smaller feeling vanish in the act of suggesting this one, their more important meaning. As I look along the dining- table I overlook the fact that the farther plates and glasses feel so much smaller than my own, for I know that they are all equal in size; and the feeling of them, which is a present sensation, is eclipsed in the share of the knowledge, which is a, merely imagined one.\n\nIf the inconsistencies of sight-spaces inter se can thus be reduced, of course there can be no difficulty in equating sight-spaces with spaces given to touch. In this equation it is probably the touch-feeling which prevails as real and the sight which serves as sign -- a reduction made necessary not only by the far greater constancy of felt over seen magnitudes, but by the greater practical interest which the sense of touch possesses for our lives. As a rule, things only benefit or harm us by coming into direct contact with our skin: sight is only a sort of anticipatory touch; the letter is, in Mr.Spencer's phrase, the 'mother-tongue of thought,' and the handmaid's idiom must be translated into the language of the mistress before it can speak clearly to the mind. [42]\n\nLater on we shall see that the feelings excited in the joints when a limb moves are used as signs of the path traversed by the extremity. But of this more anon. As for the equating of sound-, smell-, and taste-volumes with those yielded by the more discriminative senses, they are too vague to need any remark. It may be observed of pain, however, that its size has to be reduced to that of the normal tactile size of the organ which is its seat. A finger with a felon on it, and the pulses of the arteries therein, both 'feel' larger than we believe they really 'are.'\n\nIt will have been noticed in the account given that when two sensorial sense-impressions, believed to come from the same object, differ, then THE ONE MOST INTERESTING, practically or \u00e6sthetically, Is JUDGED TO BE THE TRUE ONE. This law of interest holds throughout -- though a permanent interest, like that of touch, may resist a strong but fleeting one like that of pain, as in the case just given of the felon.\n\n3. The Summation of the Sense-spaces.\n\nNow for the next step in our construction of real space: How are the various sense-spaces added together into a consolidated and unitary continuum? For they are, in man at all events, incoherent at the start.\n\nHere again the first fact that appears is that primitively our space-experiences form a chaos, out of which we have no immediate faculty for extricating them. Objects of different sense-organs, experienced together, do not in the first instance appear either inside or alongside or far outside of each other, neither spatially continuous nor discontinuous, in any definite sense of these words. The same thing is almost as true of objects felt by different parts of the same organ before discrimination has done its finished work. The most we can say is that all our space-experiences together form an objective total and that this objective total is vast.\n\nEven now the space inside our mouth, which is so intimately known and accurately measured by its inhabitant the tongue, can hardly be said to have its internal directions and dimensions known in any exact relation to those of the larger world outside. It forms almost a little world by itself. Again, when the dentist excavates a small cavity in one of our teeth, we feel the hard point of his instrument scraping, in distinctly differing directions, a surface which seems to our sensibility vaguely larger than the subsequent use of the mirror tells us it 'really' is. And though the directions of the scraping differ so completely inter se, not one of them can be identified with the particular direction in the outer world to which it corresponds. The space of the tooth-sensibility is thus really a little world by itself, which can only become congruent with the outer space- world by farther experiences which shall alter its bulk, identify its directions, fuse its margins, and finally embed it as a definite part within a definite whole. And even though every joint's rotations should be felt to vary inter se as so many differences of direction in a common room; even though the same were true of diverse tracings on the skin, and of diverse tracings on the retina respectively, it would still not follow that feelings of direction, on these different surfaces, are intuitively comparable among each other, or with the other directions yielded by the feelings of the semi-circular canals. It would not follow that we should immediately judge the relations of them all to each other in one space-world.\n\nIf with the arms in an unnatural attitude we 'feel' things, we are perplexed about their shape, size, and position. Let the reader lie on his back with his arms stretched above his head, and it will astonish him to find how in able he is to recognize the geometrical relations of objects placed within reach of his hands. But the geometrical relations here spoken of are nothing but identities recognized between the directions and sizes perceived in this way and those perceived in the more usual ways. The two ways do not fit each other intuitively.\n\nHow lax the connection between the system of visual and the system of tactile directions is in man, appears from the facility with which microscopists learn to reverse the movements of their hand in manipulating things on the stage of the instrument. To move the slide to the seen left they must draw it to the felt right. But in a very few days the habit becomes a second nature. So in tying our cravat, shaving before a mirror, etc., the right and left sides are inverted, and the directions of our hand movements are the opposite of what they seen. Yet this never annoys us. Only when by accident we try to tie the cravat of another person do we learn that there are two ways of combining sight and touch perceptions. Let any one try for the first time to write or draw while looking at the image of his hand and paper in a mirror, and he will be utterly bewildered. But a very short training will teach him to undo in this respect the associations of his previous lifetime.\n\nPrisms show this in an even more striking way. If the eyes be armed with spectacles containing slightly prismatic glasses with their bases turned, for example, towards the right, every object looked at will be apparently translocated to the left; and the hand put forth to grasp ally which object will make the mistake of passing beyond it on the left side. But less than an hour of practice in wearing such spectacles rectifies the judgment so that no more mistakes are made. In fact the new-formed associations are already so strong, that when the prisms are first laid aside again the opposite error is committed, the habits of a lifetime violated, and the hand now passed to the right of every object which it seeks to touch.\n\nThe primitive chaos thus subsists to a great degree through life so far as our immediate sensibility goes. We feel our various objects and their bignesses, together or in succession; but so soon as it is a question of the order and relations of many of them at once our intuitive apprehension remains to the very end most vague and incomplete. Whilst we are attending to one, or at most to two or three objects, all the others lapse, and the most we feel of them is that they still linger on the outskirts and can be caught again by turning in a certain way. Nevertheless throughout all this confusion we conceive of a world spread out in a perfectly fixed and orderly fashion, and we believe in its existence. The question is: How do this conception and this belief arise? How is the chaos smoothed and straightened out?\n\nMainly by two operations: Some of the experiences are apprehended to exist out- and alongside of each other, and others are apprehended to interpenetrate each other, and to occupy the same room. In this way what was incoherent and irrelative ends by being coherent and definitely related ; nor is it hard to trace the principles, by which the mind is guided in this arrangement of its perceptions, in detail.\n\nIn the first place, following the great intellectual law of economy, we simplify, unify, and identify as much as we possibly can. Whatever sensible data can be attended to together we locate together. Their several extents seem one extent. The place at which each appears is held to be the same with the place at which the others appear. They become, in short, so many properties of ONE AND THE SAME REAL THING. This is the first and great commandment, the fundamental 'act' by which our world gets spatially arranged.\n\nIn this coalescence in a 'thing,' one of the coalescing sensations is held to be the thing, the other sensations are taken for its more or less accidental properties, or modes of appearance. [43] The sensation chosen to be the thing essentially is the most constant and practically important of the lot; most often it is hardness or weight. But the hardness or weight is never without tactile bulk; and as we can always see something in our hand when me feel something there, we can always see something there when we essence of the 'thing.' Frequently a shape so figures, sometimes a, temperature, a taste, etc.; but for the most part temperature, smell, sound, color, or whatever other phenomena may vividly impress us simultaneously with the bulk felt or seen, figure among the accidents. Smell and sound impress us, it is true, when we neither see nor touch the thing; but they are strongest when we see or touch, so we locate the source of these properties within the touched or seen space, whilst their properties themselves we regard as overflowing in a weakened form into the spaces fined by other-things. In all this, it will be observed, the sense-data whose spaces coalesce into one are yield by different sense-organs. Such data have no tendency to displace each other from consciousness, but can be attended to together all at once. Often indeed they vary concomitantly and reach a maximum together. We may be sure, therefore, that the general rule of our mind is to locate IN each other all sensations which are associated in simultaneous experience, and do not interfere with each other's perception. [44]\n\nDifferent impressions on the same sense-organ do interfere with each other's perception, and cannot well be attended to at once. Hence we do not locate them in each other's spaces, but arrange them in a serial order of exteriority, each alongside of the rest, in a space larger than that which any one sensation brings. This larger space, however, is an object of conception rather than of direct intuition, and bears all the marks of being constructed piecemeal by the mind. The blind man forms it out of tactile, locomotor, and auditory experiences, the seeing men out of visual ones almost exclusively. As the visual construction is the easiest to understand, let us consider that first.\n\nEvery single visual sensation or 'field of view' is limited. To get a new field of view for our object the old one must disappear. But the disappearance may be only partial. Let the first field of view be A B C. If we carry our attention to the limit C, it ceases to be the limit, and becomes the centre of the field, and beyond it appear fresh parts where there were none before: [45] A B C changes, in short, to C D E. But although the parts A B are lost to sight, yet their image abides in the memory; and if we think of our first object A B C as having existed or as still existing at all, we must think of it as it was originally presented, namely, as spread out from C in one direction just as C D E is spread out in another. A B and D E can never coalesce in one place (as they could were they objects of different senses) because they call never be perceived at once: we must lose one to see the other. So (the letters standing now for 'things') we get to conceive of the successive fields of things after the analogy of the several things which we perceive in a single field. They must be out- and along-side of each other, and we conceive that their juxtaposed spaces must make a larger space. A B C + C D E must, in short, be imagined to exist in the form of A B C D E or not imagined at all.\n\nWe can usually recover anything lost from sight by moving our attention and our eyes back in its direction; and through these constant changes every field of seen things comes at last to be thought of as always having a fringe of other things possible to be seen spreading in all directions round about it. Meanwhile the movements concomitantly with which the various fields alternate are also felt and remembered; and gradually (through association) this and that movement come in our thought to suggest this or that extent of fresh objects introduced. Gradually, too, since the objects vary indefinitely in kind, we abstract from their several natures and think separately of their mere extents, of which extents the various movements remain as the only constant introducers and associates. More and more, therefore, do we think of movement and seen extent as mutually involving? each other, until at last (with Bain and J. S. Mill) we may get to regard them as synonymous, and say, \"What is the meaning of the word extent, unless it be possible movement?\" [46] We forget in this conclusion that (whatever intrinsic extensiveness the movements may appear endowed with), that seen spreadoutness which is the pattern of the abstract extensiveness which we imagine came to us originally from the retinal sensation.\n\nThe muscular sensations of the eyeball signify this sort of visible spreadoutness, just as this visible spreadoutness may come in later experience to signify the 'real' bulks, distances, lengths and breadths known to touch and locomotion. [47] To the very end, however in us seeing men, the quality, the nature, the sort of thing we mean by extensiveness, would seem to be the sort of feeling which our retinal stimulations bring.\n\nIn one deprived of sight the principles by which the notion of real space is constructed are the same. Skin-feelings take in him the place of retinal feelings in giving the quality of lateral spreadoutness, as our attention passes from one extent of them to another, awakened by an object sliding along. Usually the moving object is our hand; and feelings of movement in our joints invariably accompany the feelings in the skin. But the feeling of the skin is what the blind man means by his skin; so the size of the skin-feelings stands as the absolute or real size, and the size of the joint-feelings becomes a sign of these. Suppose, for example, a blind baby with (to make the description shorter) a blister on his toe, exploring his leg with his finger-tip and feeling a pain shoot up sharply the instant the blister is touched. The experiment gives him four different kinds of sensation -- two of them protracted, two sudden. The first pair are the movement-feeling in the joints of the upper limb, and the movement-feeling on the skin of the leg and foot. These, attended to together, have their extents identified as one objective space -- the hand moves through the same space in which the leg lies. The second pair of objects are the pain in the blister, and the peculiar feeling the blister gives to the finger. Their spaces also fuse; and as each marks the end of a peculiar movement-series (arm moved, leg stroked), the movement-spaces are emphatically identified with each other at that end. Were there other small blisters distributed down the leg, there would be a number of these emphatic points; the movement-spaces would be identified, not only as totals, but point for point. [48]\n\nJust so with space beyond the body's limits. Continuing the joint-feeling beyond the toe, the baby hits another object which he can still think of when he brings his back to its blister again. That object at the end of that joint feeling means a new place for him, and the more such objects multiply in his experience the wider does the space of his conception grow. If, wandering through the woods to-day by a new path, I find myself suddenly in a glad which affects my senses exactly as did another I reached last week at the end of different walk, I believe the two identical affection to present the same persisting glade, and infer that I have attained it by two differing roads. The case in whit differs when shorter movements are concerned. If, moving first one arm and then another, the blind child gets the same kind of sensation upon the hand, and gets it again as often as he repeats either process, he judges that he has touched the same object by both motions, and concludes that the motions terminate in a common place. From place to place marked in this way he moves, and adding the places moved through, one to another, he builds up his notion of the extent of the outer world. The seeing man's process is identical; only his units, which may be successive bird's-eye view, are much larger than in the case of the blind.\n\nFEELINGS IN JOINTS AND FEELINGS IN MUSCLES\n\n1. Feelings of Movement in Joints\n\nI have been led to speak of feelings which arise in joints. As these feeling have too much neglecting Psychology hitherto, in entering now somewhat minutely in the interest of the reader, which under the rather dry abstractions of the previous pages may presumably have flagged.\n\nWhen by simply flexing my right forefinger on its metacarpal joint, I trace with its tip an inch on the palm of my left hand, is my feeling of the size of the inch purely and simply a feeling in the skin of the palm, or have the muscular contractions of the right hand and forearm anything to do with it? In the preceding pages I have constantly assumed spatial sensibility to be an affair of surfaces. At first starting, the consideration of the 'muscular sense' as a space-measurer was postponed to a later stage. Many writers, of whom the foremost was Thomas Brown, in his Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human Mind, and of whom the latest is no less a Psychologist than Prof. Delboeuf, [49] hold that the consciousness of active muscular motion, aware of its own amount, is the fons et origo of all spatial measurement. It would seem to follow, if this theory were true, that two skin-feelings, one of a large patch, one of small one, possess their difference of spatiality, not as an immediate element, but solely by virtue of the fact that the large, to get its points successively excited, demands more muscular contraction than the small one does. Fixed associations with the several amounts of muscular contractions required in this particular experience would thus ex- plain the apparent sizes of the skin-patches, which sizes would consequently not be primitive data but derivative results.\n\nIt seems to me that no evidence of the muscular measurements in question exists; but that all the facts may be explained by surface-sensibility, provided we take that of the joint-surfaces also into account. The most striking argument, and the most obvious one, which an upholder of the muscular theory is likely to produce is undoubtedly this fact: if, with closed eyes, we trace figures in the air with the extended forefinger (the motions may occur from the metacarpal-, the wrist-, the elbow-, or the shoulder-joint indifferently), what we are conscious of in each case, and indeed most acutely conscious of, is the geometric path described by the finger-tip. Its angles, its subdivisions, are all as distinctly felt as if seen by the eye; and yet the surface of the finger-tip receives no impression at all. [50] But with each variation of the figure, the muscular contractions vary, and so do the feelings which these yield. Are not these latter the sensible data that make us aware of the lengths and directions we discern in the traced line?\n\nShould we be tempted to object to this supposition of the advocate of perception by muscular feelings, that we have learned the spatial significance of the feelings by reiterated experiences of seeing what figure is drawn when each special muscular grouping is felt, so that in the last resort the muscular space feelings would be derived from retinal-surface feelings, our opponent might immediately hush us by pointing to the fact that in persons born blind the phenomenon in question is even more perfect than in ourselves. If we suggest that the blind may have originally traced the figures on the cutaneous surface of cheek, thigh, or palm, and may now remember the specific figure which each present movement formerly caused the skin-surface to perceive, he may reply that the delicacy of the motor percep- tion far exceeds that of most of the cutaneous surfaces; that, in fact, we can feel a figure traced only in its differentials, so to speak, -- a figure which we merely start to trace by our finger-tip, a figure which, traced in the same way on our finger-tip by the hand of another, is almost if not wholly unrecognizable.\n\nThe champion of the muscular sense seems likely to be triumphant until we invoke the articular cartilages, as internal surfaces whose sensibility is called in play by every movement we make, however delicate the latter may be.\n\nTo establish the part they play in our geometrizing, it is necessary to review a, few facts. It has long been known by medical practitioners that, in patients with cutaneous an\u00e6sthesia of a limb, whose muscles also are insensible to the thrill of the faradic current, a very accurate sense of the way in which the limb may be flexed or extended by the hand of another may be preserved. [51] On the other hand, we may have this sense of movement impaired when the tactile sensibility is well preserved. That the pretended feeling of outgoing innervation can play in these cases no part, is obvious from the fact that the movements by which the limb changes its position are passive ones, imprinted on it by the experimenting physician. The writers who have sought a rationale of the matter have consequently been driven by way of exclusion to assume the articular surfaces to be the seat of the perception in question. [52]\n\nThat the joint-surfaces are sensitive appears evident from the fact that in inflammation they become the seat of excruciating pains, and from the perception by everyone who lifts weights or presses against resistance, that every increase of the force opposing him betrays itself to his consciousness principally by the starting-out of new feelings or the increase of old ones, in or about the joints. If the structure and mode of mutual application of two articular surfaces be taken into account, it will appear that, granting the surfaces to be sensitive, no more favorable mechanical conditions could be possible for the delicate calling of the sensibility into play than are realized in the minutely graduated rotations and firmly resisted variations of pressure involved in every act of extension or flexion. Nevertheless it is a greet pity that we have as yet no direct testimony, no expressions from patients with healthy joints accidentally laid open, of the impressions they experience when the cartilage is pressed or rubbed.\n\nThe first approach to direct evidence, so far as I know is contained in the paper of Lewinski, [53] published in 1879. This observer had a patient the inner half of whose leg was an\u00e6sthetic. When this patient stood up, he had a curious illusion about the position of his limb, which disappeared the moment he lay down again: he thought himself knock-kneed. If, as Lewinski says, we assume the inner half of the joint to share the insensibility of the corresponding part of the skin, then he ought to feel, when the joint-surfaces pressed against each other in the act of standing, the outer half of the joint most strongly. But this is the feeling he would also get whenever it was by any chance sought to force his leg into a knock-kneed attitude. Lewinski was led by this case to examine the feet of certain ataxic patients with imperfect sense of position. He found in every instance that when the toes were flexed and drawn upon at the same time (the joint-surfaces drawn asunder) all sense of the amount of flexion disappeared. On the contrary, when he pressed a toe whilst flexing it, the patient's appreciation of the amount of flexion was much improved, evidently because the artificial increase of articular pressure made up for the pathological insensibility of the parts.\n\nSince Lewinski's paper an important experimental research by A. Goldscheider [54] has appeared, which completely establishes our point. This patient observer caused his fingers, arms, and legs to be passively rotated upon their various joints in a mechanical apparatus which registered both the velocity of movement impressed and the amount of angular rotation. No active muscular contraction took place. The minimal felt amounts of rotation were in all cases surprisingly small, being much less than a single angular degree in all the joints except those of the fingers. Such displacements as these, the author says (p. 490), can hardly be detected by the eye. The point of application of the force which rotated the limb made no difference in the result. Rotations round the hip-joint, for example, were as delicately felt when the leg was hung by the heel as when it was hung by the thigh whilst the movements were performed. An\u00e6sthesia of the skin produced by induction-currents also had no disturbing effect on the perception, nor did the various degrees of pressure of the moving force upon the skin affect it. It became, in fact, all the more distinct in proportion as the concomitant pressure-feelings were eliminated by artificial an\u00e6sthesia. When the joints themselves, however, were made artificially an\u00e6sthetic the perception of the movement grew obtuse and the angular rotations had to be much increased before they were perceptible. All these facts prove according to Herr Goldscheider, that the joint surfaces and these alone are the starting point of the impressions by which the movements of our members are immediately perceived.\n\nApplying this result, which seems invulnerable, to the case of the tracing finger-tip, we see that our perception of the latter gives no countenance to the theory of the muscular sense. We indubitably localize the finger-tip at the successive points of its path by means of the sensations which we receive from our joints. But if this is so, it may be asked, why do we feel the figure to be traced, not within the joint itself, but in such an altogether different place? And why do we feel it so much larger than it really is?\n\nI will answer these questions by asking another: Why do we move our joists at all? Surely to gain something more valuable than the insipid joint-feelings themselves. And these more interesting feelings are in the main produced upon the skin of the moving part, or of some other part over which it passes, or upon the eye. With movements of the fingers we explore the configuration of all real objects with which we have to deal, our own body as well as foreign things. Nothing that interests us is located in the joint; everything that interests us either is some part of our skin, or is something that we see as we handle it. The cutaneously felt and the seen extents come thus to figure as the important things for us to concern ourselves with. Every time the joint moves, even though we neither see, nor feel cutaneously, the reminiscence of skin-events and sights which formerly coincided with that extent of movement, ideally awaken as the movement's import, and the mind drops the present sign to attend to the import alone. The joint-sensation itself, as such, does not disappear in the process. A little attention easily detects it, with all its fine peculiarities, hidden beneath its vaster suggestions; so that really the mind has two space-perceptions before it, congruent in form but different in scale and place, either of which exclusively it may notice, or both at once, -- the joint-space which it feels and the real space which it means.\n\nThe joint-spaces serve so admirably as signs because of their capacity for parallel variation to all the peculiarities of external motion. There is not a direction in the real world nor a ratio of distance which cannot be matched by some direction or extent of joint-rotation. Joint-feelings, like all feelings, are roomy. Specific ones are contrasted inter se as different directions are contrasted within the same extent. If I extend my arm straight out at the shoulder, the rotation of the shoulder-joint will give me one feeling of movement; if then I sweep the arm forward, the same joint will give me another feeling of movement. Both these movements are felt to happen in space and differ in specific quality. Why shall not the specificness of the quality just consist in the feeling of a peculiar direction? [55] Why may not the several joint-feelings be so many perceptions of movement in so many different directions? That we cannot explain why they should is no presumption that they do not, for we never can explain why any sense-organ should awaken the sensation it does.\n\nBut if the joint-feelings are directions and extents, standing in relation to each other, the task of association in interpreting their import in eye- or skin-terms is a good deal simplified. Let the movement bc, of a certain joint, derive its absolute space-value from the cutaneous feeling it is always capable of engendering; then the longer movement abcd of the same joint will be judged to have a greater space-value, even though it may never have wholly merged with a skin-experience. So of differences of direction: so much joint-difference = so much skin-difference; therefore, more joint-difference = more skin-difference. In fact, the joint-feeling can frequently serve as a map on a reduced scale, of a reality which the imagination can identify at its pleasure with this or that sensible extension simultaneously known in some other way.\n\nWhen the joint-feeling in itself acquires an emotional interest, -- which happens whenever the joint is inflamed and painful, -- the secondary suggestions fail to arise, and the movement is felt where it is, and in its intrinsic scale of magnitude. [56]\n\nThe localization of the joint-feeling in a space simultaneously known otherwise (i.e. to eye or skin), is what is commonly called the extradition or eccentric projection of the feeling. In the preceding chapter I said a good deal on this subject; but we must now see a little more closely just what happens in this instance of it. The content of the joint-feeling, to begin with, is an object, and is in itself a place. For it to be placed, say in the elbow, the elbow as seen or handled must already have become another object for the mind, and with its place as thus known, the place which the joint- feeling fins must coalesce. That the latter should be felt 'in the elbow' is therefore a 'projection' of it into the place of another object as much as its being felt in the finger-tip or at the end of a cane can be. But when we say 'projection' we generally have in our mind the notion of a there as contrasted with a here. What is the here when we say that the joint-feeling is there? The 'here' seems to be the spot which the mind has chosen for its own post of observation, usually some place within the head, but sometimes within the throat or breast -- not rigorously fixed spot, but a region from any portion of which it may send forth its various acts of attention. Extradition from either of these regions is the common law under which we perceive the whereabouts of the north star, of our own voice, of the contact of our teeth with each other, of the tip of our finger, of the point of our cane on the ground, or of a movement in our elbow-joint.\n\nBut for the distance between the 'here' and the 'there' to be felt, the entire intervening space must be itself an object of perception. The consciousness of this intervening space is tile sine gu\u00e2 non of the joint-feeling's projection to the farther end of it. When it is fined by our own bodily tissues (as where the projection Only goes as far as the elbow or finger-tip) we are sensible of its extent alike by our eye, by our exploring movements, and by the resident sensations which fin its length. When it reaches beyond the limits of our body, the resident sensations are lacking, but limbs and hand and eye suffice to make it known. Let me, for example, locate a feeling of motion coming from my elbow-joint in the point of my cane a yard beyond my hand. Either I see this yard as I flourish the cane, and the seen end of it then absorbs my sensation just as my seen elbow might absorb it, or I am blind and imagine the cane as an object continuing my arm, either because I have explored both arm and cane with the other hand, or because I have pressed them both along my body and leg. If I project my joint-feeling farther still, it is by a conception rather than a distinct imagination of the space. I think: 'farther,' 'thrice as far,' etc.; and thus get a symbolic image of a distant path at which I point. [57] But the 'absorption' of the joint- feeling by the distant spot, in whatever terms the latter may be apprehended, is never anything but that coalescence into one 'thing' already spoken of on page 184, of whatever different sensible objects interest our attention at once.\n\n2. Feelings of Muscular Contraction.\n\nReaders versed in psychological literature will have missed, in our account thus far, the usual invocation of 'the muscular sense.' This word is used with extreme vagueness to cover all resident sensations, whether of motion or position, in our members, and even to designate the supposed feeling of efferent discharge from the brain. We shall later see good reason to deny the existence of the latter feeling. We have accounted. for the better part at least of the resident feelings of motion in limbs by the sensibility of the articular surfaces. The skin and ligaments also must have feelings awakened as they are stretched or squeezed in flexion or extension. And I am inclined to think that the sensations of our contracting muscles themselves probably play as small a part in building up our exact knowledge of space as any class of sensations which we possess. The muscles, indeed, play an all-important part, but it is through the remote effect of their contractions on other sensitive parts, not through their own resident sensations being aroused. In other words, muscular contraction is only indirectly instrumental, in giving us space-perceptions, by its effects on surfaces. In skin and retina it produces a motion of the stimulus upon the surface; in joints it produces a motion of the surfaces upon each other -- such motion being by far the most delicate manner of exciting the surfaces in question. One is tempted to doubt whether the muscular sensibility as such plays even a subordinate part as sign of these more immediately geometrical perceptions which are so uniformly associated with it as effects of the contraction objectively viewed.\n\nFor this opinion many reasons can be assigned. First, it seems a priori improbable that such organs as muscles should give us feelings whose variations bear any exact proportion to the spaces traversed when they contract. As G. E. M\u00fcller says, [58] their sensory nerves must be excited either chemically or by mechanical compression whilst the contractions last, and in neither case can the excitement be proportionate to the position into which the limb is thrown. The chemical state of the muscle depends on the previous work more than on the actually present contraction; and the internal pressure of it depends on the resistance offered more than on the shortening attained. The intrinsic muscular sensation are likely therefore to be merely those of massive strain or fatigue, and to carry no accurate discrimination with them of lengths of path moved through.\n\nEmpirically we find this probability confirmed by many facts. The judicious A. W. Volkman observes [59] that:\n\n''Muscular feeling gives tolerably fine evidence as to the existence of movement, but hardly any direct information about its extent or direction. We are not aware that the contractions of a supinator longus have a wider range than those of a supinator brevis; and that the fibres of a bipenniform muscle contract in opposite directions is a fact of which the muscular feeling itself gives not the slightest intimation. Muscle-feeling belong to that class of general sensations which tell us of our inner states, but not of outer relations ; it does not belong among the sense-perceiving senses.\"\n\nE. H. Weber in his article Tastsinn called attention to the fact that muscular movements as large and strong as those of the diaphragm go on continually without our perceiving them as motion.\n\nG. H. Lewes makes the same remark. When we think of our muscular sensations as movements in space, it is because we have ingrained with them in our imagination a movement on a surface simultaneously felt.\n\n\"Thus whenever we breathe there is a contraction of the muscles of the ribs and the diaphragm. Since we see the chest expanding, we know it as a movement and can only think of it as such. But the diaphragm itself is not seen, and consequently by no one who is not physiologically enlightened on the point is this diaphragm thought of in movement. Nay, even when told by a physiologist that the diaphragm moves at each breathing, every one who has not seen it moving down- ward pictures it as an upward movement, because the chest moves upward.\" [60]\n\nA personal experience of my own seems strongly to corroborate this view. For years I have been familiar, during the act of gaping, with a large, round, smooth sensation in tile region of the throat, a sensation characteristic of gaping and nothing else, but which, although I had often wondered about it, never suggested to my mind the motion of anything. The reader probably knows from his own experience exactly what feeling I mean. It was not till one of my students told me, that I learned its objective cause. If we look into the mirror while gaping, we see that at the moment we have this feeling the hanging palate rises by the contraction of its intrinsic muscles. The contraction of these muscles and the compression of the palatine mucous membrane are what occasion the feeling; and I was at first astonished that, coming from so small an organ, it could appear so voluminous. Now the curious point is this -- that no sooner had I learned by the eye its objective space-significance, than I found myself enabled mentally to feel it as a movement upwards of a body in the situation of the uvula. When I now have it, my fancy injects it, so to speak, with the image of the rising uvula; and it absorbs the image easily and naturally. In a word, a, muscular contraction gave me a sensation whereof I was unable during forty years to interpret a motor meaning, of which two glances of the eye made me permanently the master. To my mind no further proof is needed of the fact that muscular contraction, merely as such, need not be perceived directly as so much motion through space.\n\nTake again the contractions of the muscles which make the eyeball rotate. The feeling of these is supposed by many writers to play the chief part in our perceptions of extent. The space seen between two things means, according to these authors, nothing but the amount of contraction which is needed to carry the fovea from the first thing to the second. But close the eyes and note the contractions in themselves (even when coupled as they still are with the delicate surface sensations Of the eyeball rolling under the lids), and we are surprised standing how vague their space- import appears. Shut the eyes and roll them, and you call with no approach to accuracy tell the outer object which shall first be seen when you open them again. [61] Moreover, if our eye-muscle-contractions had much to do with giving us our sense of seen extent, we ought to have a natural illusion of which we and no trace. Since the feeling in the muscles grows disproportionately intense as the eyeball is rolled into an extreme eccentric position, all places on the extreme margin of the field of view ought to appear farther from the centre than they really are, for the fovea cannot get to them without an amount of this feeling altogether in excess of the amount of actual rotation. [62] When we turn to the muscles of the body at large we find the same vagueness. Goldscheider found that the minimal perceived rotation of size depend on a comparison of a limb about a joint was no less when the movement was 'active' or produced by muscular contraction than when it was 'passively' impressed. [63] The consciousness of active movement became so blunt when the joint (alone!) was made an\u00e6sthetic by faradization, that it became evident that the feeling of contraction could never be used for fine discrimination of extents. And that it was not used for coarse discriminations appeared clear to Goldscheider from certain other results which are too circumstantial for me to quote in detail. [64] His general conclusion is that we feel our movements exclusively in our articular surfaces, and that our muscular contractions in all probability hardly occasion this sort of perception at all. [65]\n\nMy conclusion is that the 'muscular sense' must fall back to the humble position from which Charles Bell raised it, and no longer figure in Psychology as the leading organ in space perception which it has been so long 'cracked up' to be.\n\nBefore making a minuter study of Space as apprehended by the eye, we must turn to see what we can discover of space as known to the blind. But as we do so, let us cast a glance upon the results of the last pages, and ask ourselves once more whether the building up of orderly space-perceptions out of primitive incoherency requires any mental powers beyond those displayed in ordinary intellectual operations. I think it is obvious -- granting the spacial qualia to exist in the primitive sensations -- that discrimination, association, addition, multiplication, and division, blending into generic images, substitution of similars, selective emphasis, and abstraction from uninteresting details, are quite capable of giving us all the space-percep- tions we have so far studied, without the aid of any mysterious 'mental chemistry' or power of 'synthesis' to create elements absent from the original data of feeling. It cannot be too strongly urged in the face of mystical attempts, however learned, that there is not a landmark, not a length, not a point of the compass in real space which is not some one of our feelings, either experienced directly as a presentation or ideally suggested by another feeling which has come to serve as its sign. In degrading some sensations to the rank of signs and exalting others to that of realities signified, we smooth out the wrinkles of our first chaotic impressions and make a continuous order of what was a rather incoherent multiplicity. But the content of the order remains identical with that of the multiplicity -- sensational both, through and through.\n\nHOW THE BLIND PERCEIVE SPACE.\n\nThe blind man's construction of real space differs from that of the seeing man most obviously in the larger part which synthesis plays in it, and the relative subordination of analysis. The seeing baby's eyes take in the whole room at once, and discriminative attention must arise in him before single objects are visually discerned. The blind child, on the contrary, must form his mental image of the room by the addition, piece to piece, of parts which he learns to know successively. With our eyes we may apprehend instantly, in an enormous bird's-eye view, a landscape which the blind man is condemned to build up bit by bit after weeks perhaps of exploration. We are exactly in his predicament, however, for spaces which exceed our visual range. We think the ocean as a whole by multiplying mentally the impression we get at any moment when at sea. The distance between New York and San Francisco is computed in days' journeys; that from earth to sun is so many times the earth's diameter, etc.; and of longer distances still we may be said to have no adequate mental image whatever, but only numerical verbal symbols. But the symbol will often give us the emotional effect of the perception. Such expressions as the abysmal vault of heaven, the endless expanse of ocean, etc., summarize many computations to the imagination, and give the sense of an enormous horizon. So it seems with the blind. They multiply mentally the amount of a distinctly felt freedom to move, anti gain the immediate sense of a vaster freedom still. Thus it is that blind men are never without the consciousness of their horizon. They all enjoy travelling, especially with a companion. On the prairies the feel the great openness; in valleys they feel closed in; and one has told me that he thought few seeing people could enjoy the view from a mountain-top more than he. A blind person on entering a house or room immediately receives, from the reverberations of his voice and steps, an impression of its dimensions, and to a certain extent of its arrangement. The tympanic sense noticed on p. 140, supra, comes in to help here, and possibly other forms of tactile sensibility not yet understood. Mr. Hank Levy, the blind author of 'Blindness and the Blind' (London), gives the following account of his powers of perception:\n\n\"Whether within a house or in the open air, whether walking or standing still, I can tell, although quite blind, when I am opposite an object, and can perceive whether it be tall or short, slender or bulky. I can also detect whether it be a solitary object or a continuous fence; whether it be a close fence or composed of open rails ; and often whether it be a wooden fence, a brick or stone wall, or a quick-set hedge. I cannot usually perceive objects if much lower than my shoulder, but sometimes very low objects can be detected. This may depend on the nature of the objects, or on some abnormal state of the atmosphere. The currents of air can have nothing to do with this power, as the state of the wind does not directly affect it; the sense of hearing has nothing to do with it, as when snow lies thickly on the ground objects are more distinct, although the footfall cannot be heard. I seem to perceive objects through the skin of my face, and to have the impressions immediately transmitted to the brain. The only part of my body possessing this power is my face; this I have ascertained by suitable experiments. Stopping my ears does not interfere with it, but covering my face with a thick veil destroys it altogether. None of the five senses have anything to do with the existence of this power, and the circumstances above named induce me to call this unrecognized sense by the name of 'facial perception.'... When passing along a street I can distinguish shops from private houses, and even point out the doors and windows, etc., and this whether the doors be shut or open. When a window consists of one entire sheet of glass, it is more difficult to dis- cover than one composed of a number of small panes. From this it would appear that glass is a bad conductor of sensation, or at any rate of the sensation specially connected with this sense. When objects below the face are perceived, the sensation seems to come in an oblique line from the object to the upper part of the face. While walking with a friend in Forest Lane, Stratford, I said, pointing to a fence which separated the road from a Field, 'Those rails are not quite as high as my shoulder.' He looked at them, and said they were higher. We, however, measured, and found them about, three inches lower than my shoulder. At the time of making this observation I was about four feet from the rails. Certainly in this instance facial perception was more accurate than sight. When the lower part of a. fence is brick-work, and the upper part rails, the fact can be detected, and the line where the two meet easily perceived. Irregularities in height, and projections and indentations in walls, call also be discovered.\"\n\nAccording to Mr. Levy, this power of seeing with the face is diminished by a fog, but not by ordinary darkness. At one time he could tell when a cloud obscured the horizon, but he has now lost that power, which he has known several persons to possess who are totally blind. These effects of aqueous vapor suggest immediately that fluctuations in the heat radiated by the objects may be the source of the perception. One blind gentleman, Mr. Kilburne, an instructor in the Perkins Institution in South Boston, who has the power spoken of in an unusual degree, proved, however, to have no more delicate a sense of temperature in his face than ordinary persons. He himself supposed that his ears had nothing to do with the faculty until a complete stoppage of them, not only with cotton but with putty on top of it, by abolishing the perception entirely, proved his first impression to be erroneous. Many blind men say immediately that their ears are concerned in the matter. Sounds certainly play a far more prominent part in the mental Life of the blind than in our own. In taking a walk through the country, the mutations of sound, far and near, constitute their chief delight. And to a, great extent their imagination of distance and of objects moving from one distant spot to another seems to consist in thinking how a certain sonority would be modified by the change of place. It is unquestionable that the semi-circular-canal feelings play a great part in determining the points of the com- pass and the direction of distant spots, in the blind as in us. We start towards them by feelings of this sort; and so many directions, so many different-feeling starts. [66]\n\nThe only point that offers any theoretic difficulty is the prolongation into space of the direction, after the start. We saw, ten pages back, that for extradition to occur beyond the skin, the portion of skin in question and the space beyond must form a common object for some other sensory surface. The eyes are for most of us this sensory surface; for the blind it can only be other parts of the skin, coupled or not with motion. But the mere gropings of the hands in every direction must end by surrounding the whole body with a sphere of felt space. And this sphere must become enlarged with every movement of locomotion, these movements gaining their space-values from the semi-circular-canal feelings which accompany them, and from the farther and farther parts of large fixed objects (such as the bed, the wainscoting, or a fence) which they bring within the grasp. It might be supposed that a knowledge of space acquired by so many successive discrete acts would always retain a somewhat jointed and so to speak, granulated character. When we who are gifted with sight think of a space too large to come into a single field of view, we are apt to imagine it as composite, and fined with more or less jerky stoppings and startings (think, for instance, of the space from here to San Francisco), or else we reduce the scale symbolically and imagine how much larger on a map the distance would look than others with whose totality we are familiar.\n\nI am disposed to believe, after interrogating many blind persons, that the use of imaginary maps on a reduced scale is less frequent with them than With the rest of us. Possibly the extraordinary changeableness of the visual magnitudes of things makes this habit natural to us, while the fixity of tactile magnitudes keeps them from falling into it. (When the blind young mall operated on by Dr. Franz was shown a, portrait in a locket, he was vastly surprised that the face could be put into so small a compass: it would have seemed to him, he said, as impossible as to put a bushel into a pint.) Be this as it may, however, the space which each blind man feels to extend beyond his body is felt by him as one smooth continuum -- all trace of those muscular startings and stoppings and reversals which presided over its formation having been eliminated from the memory. It seems, in other words, a generic image of the space-element common to all these experiences, with the unessential particularities of each left out. In truth, where in this space a start or a, stop may have occurred was quite accidental. It may never occur just there again, and so the attention lets it drops altogether. Even as long a space as that traversed in a several-mile walk will not necessarily appear to a blind man's thought in the guise of a series of locomotor acts. Only where there is some distinct locomotor difficulty, such as a, step to ascend, a difficult crossing, or a disappearance of the path, will distinct locomotor images constitute the idea. Elsewhere the space seems continuous, and its parts may even all seem coexistent; though, as a very intelligent blind friend once remarked to me, 'To think of such distances involves probably more mental wear and tear and brain-waste in the blind than in the seeing.' This seems to point to a greater element of successive addition and construction in the blind mans idea.\n\nOur own visual explorations go on by means of innumerable stoppings and startings of the eyeballs. Yet these are all effaced from the final space-sphere of our visual imagination. They have neutralized each other. We can even distribute our attention to the right and left side simultaneously, and think of those two quarters of space as coexistent. Does the smoothing out of the locomotor interruptions from the blind man's tactile space-sphere offer any greater paradox? Surely not. And it is curious to note that both in him and in us there is one particular locomotor feeling that is apt to assert itself obstinately to the last. We and he alike spontaneously imagine space as lying in front of us, for reasons too obvious to enumerate. If we think of the space behind us, we, as a rule, have to turn round mentally, and in doing so the front space vanishes. But in this, as in the other things of which we have been talking, individuals differ widely. Some, in imagining a room, can think of all its six surfaces at once. Others mentally turn round, or, at least, imagine the room in several successive and mutually exclusive acts (cf. p. 54, above).\n\nSir William Hamilton, and J. S. Mill after him have quoted approvingly an opinion of Platner (an eighteenth-century philosopher) regarding the space-perceptions of the blind. Platner says:\n\n\"The attentive observation of it person born blind... has convinced me that the sense of touch by itself is altogether incompetent to afford us the representation of extension and space.... In fact, to those born blind, time serves instead of space. Vicinity and distance mean in their mouths nothing more than the shorter or longer time... necessary to attain from some one feeling to some other.\"\n\nAfter my own observation of blind people, I should hardly have considered this as anything but an eccentric opinion, worthy to pair off with that other belief that color is primitively seen without extent, had it not been for the remarkable Essay on Tactile and Visual Space by M. Ch. Dunan, which appeared in the Revue Philosophique for 1888. This author quotes [67] three very competent witnesses, all officials in institutions for the blind [it does not appear from the text that more than one of them was blind himself] [68], who say that blind people only live in time. M. Dunan himself does not share exactly this belief, but he insists that the blind man's and the seeing man's representation of space have absolutely naught in common, and that we are deceived into believing that what they mean by space is analogous to what we mean, by the fact that so many of them are but semi-blind and still think in visual terms, and from the farther fact that they all talk in visual terms just like ourselves. But on examining M. Dunan's reasons one finds that they all rest on the groundless logical assumption that the perception of a geometrical form which we get with our eyes, and that which a blind man gets with his fingers, must either be absolutely identical or absolutely unlike. They cannot be similar in diversity, \"for they are simple notions, and it is of the essence of such to enter the mind or leave it all at once, so that one who has a simple notion at all, possesses it in all its completeness.... Therefore, since it is impossible that the blind should have of the forms in question ideas completely identical with our seeing ones, it follows that their ideas must be radically different from and wholly irreducible to our own.\" [69] Hereupon M. Dunan has no difficulty in finding a blind man who still preserves a crude sensation of diffused light, and who says when questioned that this light has no extent. Having 'no extent' appears, however, on farther questioning, to signify merely not enveloping any particular tactile objects, nor being located within their outline; so that (allowing for latitude of expression) the result tallies perfectly with our own view. A relatively stagnant retinal sensation of diffused light, not varying when different objects are handled, would naturally remain an object quite apart. If the word 'extent' were habitually used to denote tactile extent, this sensation, having no tactile associates whatever, would naturally have 'extent' denied of it. And yet all the while it would be analogous to the tactile sensations in having the quality of bigness. Of course it would have no other tactile qualities, just as the tactile objects have no other optical qualities than bigness. All sorts of analogies obtain between the spheres of sensibility. Why are 'sweet' and 'soft' used so synonymously in most languages? and why are both these adjectives applied to objects of so many sensible kinds. Bough sounds, heavy smells, hard lights, cold colors, are other examples. Nor does it follow from such analogies as these that the sensations compared need be composite and have some of their parts identical. We saw in Chapter XIII that likeness and difference are an elementary relation, not to be resolved in every case into a mixture of absolute identity and absolute heterogeneity of content (cf. Vol. I, pp. 492-3).\n\nI conclude, then, that although in its more superficial determinations the blind man's space is very different from space, yet a deep analogy remains between the two. 'Big' and 'little,' (far' and 'near,' are similar contents of consciousness in both of us. But the measure of the bigness and the farness is very different in him and in ourselves. He, for example, can have no notion of what we mean by objects appearing smaller as they move away, because he must always conceive of them as of their constant tactile size. Nor, whatever analogy the two extensions involve, should we expect that a, blind man receiving sight for the first time should recognize his new-given optical objects by their familiar tactile names. Molyneux wrote to Locke:\n\n\"Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere, so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which the sphere. Suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table and the blind man to be made to see; query, whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube?\"\n\nThis has remained in literature as 'Molyneux's query.' Molyneux answered 'No.' And Locke says: [70]\n\n\"I agree with this thinking gentleman whom I am proud to call my friend, and am of opinion that the blind man at first sight would not be able to say which was the globe, which the cube, whilst he only saw them; though he could unerringly name them by his touch and certainly distinguish them by the difference of their figures felt.\"\n\nThis opinion has not lacked experimental confirmation. From Chesselden's case downwards, patients operated for congenital cataract have been unable to name at first the things they saw. \"So, Puss, I shall know you another time,\" said Chesselden's patient, after catching the cat, looking at her steadfastly, and setting her down. Some of this incapacity is unquestionably due to general mental confusion at the new experience, and to the excessively unfavorable conditions for perception which an eye with its lens just extirpated affords. That the analogy of inner nature between the retinal and tactile sensations goes beyond mere extensity is proved by the cases where tile patients were the most intelligent, as in the young man operated on by Dr Franz, who named circular, triangular, and quadrangular figures at first sight. [71]\n\nVISUAL SPACE.\n\nIt is when we come to analyze minutely the conditions of visual perception that difficulties arise which have made psychologists appeal to new and quasi-mythical mental powers. But I firmly believe that even here exact investigation will yield the same verdict as in the cases studied hitherto. This subject will close our survey of the facts; and if it give the result I foretell, we shall be in the best of positions for a few banal pages of critically historical review.\n\nIf a common person is asked how he is enabled to see things as they are, he will simply reply, by opening his eyes and looking. This innocent answer has, however, long since been impossible for science. There are various paradoxes and irregularities about what we appear to perceive under seemingly identical optical conditions, which immediately raise questions. To say nothing now of the time-honored conundrums of why we see upright with an inverted retinal picture, and why we do not see double; and to leave aside the whole field of color-contrasts and ambiguities, as not directly relevant to the space-problem, -- it is certain that the same retinal image makes us see quite differently-sized and differently-shaped objects at different times, and it is equally certain that the same ocular movement varies in its perceptive import. It ought to be possible, were the act of perception completely and simply intelligible, to assign for every distinct judgment of size, shape, and position a distinct optical modification of some kind as its occasion. And the connection between the two ought to be so constant that, given the same modification, we should always have the same judgment. But if we study the facts closely we soon and no such constant connection between either judgment and retinal modification, or judgment and muscular modification, to exist. The judgment seems to result from the combination of retinal, muscular and intellectual factors with each other; and any one of them may occasionally overpower the rest in a way which seems to leave the matter subject to no simple law. The scientific study of the subject, if we omit Descartes, began with Berkeley, and the particular perception he analyzed in his New Theory of Vision was that of distance or depth. Starting with the physical assumption that a difference in the distance of a point can make no difference in the nature of its retinal image, since \"distance being a line directed endwise to the eye, it projects only one point in the fund of the eye -- which point remains invariably the same, whether the distance be longer or shorter,\" he concluded that distance could not possibly be a visual sensation, but must be an intellectual 'suggestion ' from 'custom' of some non-visual experience. According to Berkeley this experience was tactile. His whole treatment of the subject was excessively vague, -- no shame to him, as a breaker of fresh ground, -- but as it has been adopted and enthusiastically hugged in all its vagueness by nearly the whole line of British psychologists who have succeeded him, it will be well for us to begin our study of vision by refuting his notion that depth cannot possibly be perceived in terms of purely visual feeling.\n\nThe Third Dimension.\n\nBerkeleyans unanimously assume that no retinal sensation can primitively be of volume; if it be of extension at all (which they are barely disposed to admit), it call be only of two-, not of three-, dimensional extension. At the beginning of the present chapter we denied this, and adduced facts to show that all objects of sensation are voluminous in three dimensions (cf. p. 136 if.). It is impossible to lie on one's back on a hill, to let tile empty abyss of blue one's whole visual field, and to sink deeper and deeper into the merely sensational mode of consciousness regarding it, without feeling: that an indeterminate, palpitating, circling depth is as indefeasibly one of its attributes as its breadth. We may artificially exaggerate this sensation of depth. Rise and look from the hill-top at the distant view; represent to yourself as vividly as possible the distance of the uttermost horizon; and then with inverted head look at the same. There will be a startling increase in the perspective, a most sensible recession of the maximum distance; and as you raise the head you can actually see the horizon-line again draw near. [72]\n\nMind, I say nothing as yet about our estimate of the 'real' amount of this depth or distance. I only want to confirm its existence as a natural and inevitable optical consort of the two other optical dimensions. The held of view is always a volume-unit. Whatever be supposed to be its absolute and 'real' size, the relative sizes of its dimensions are functions of each other. Indeed, it happens perhaps most often that the breadth- and height-feeling take their absolute measure from the depth-feeling. If we plunge our head into a wash-basin, the felt nearness of the bottom makes us feel the lateral expanse to be small. If, on the contrary, we are on a mountain-top, the distance of the horizon carries with it in our judgment a proportionate height and length in the mountain-chains that bound it to our view. But as aforesaid, let us not consider the question of absolute size now, -- it must later be taken up in a thorough way. Let us confine ourselves to the way in which the three dimensions which are seen, get their values fixed relatively to each other.\n\nReid, in his Inquiry into tile Human Mind, has a section 'Of the Geometry of Visibles,' in which he assumes to trace what the perceptions would be of a race of 'Idomenians' reduced to the sole sense of sight. Agreeing with Berkeley that sight alone can give no knowledge of the third dimension, he humorously deduces various ingenious absurdities in their interpretations of the material appearances before their eyes.\n\nNow I firmly believe, on the contrary, that one of Reid's Idomenians would frame precisely the same conception of the external world that we do, if he had our intellectual powers. [73] Even were his very eyeballs fixed and not movable like ours, that would only retard, not frustrate, his education. For the same object, by alternately covering in its lateral movements different parts of his retina, would determine the mutual equivalencies of the first two dimensions of the held of view; and by exciting the physiological cause of his perception of depth in various degrees, it would establish a scale of equivalency between the first two and the third.\n\nFirst of all, one of the sensations given by the object is chosen to represent its 'real' size and shape, in accordance with the principles laid down on pp. 178 and 179. One sensation measures the 'thing' present, and the 'thing' then measures the other sensations. The peripheral parts of the retina are equated with the central by receiving the image of the same object. This needs no elucidation in case the object does not change its distance or its front. But suppose, to take a more complicated case, that the object is a stick, seen first in its whole length, and then rotated round one of its ends; let this fixed end be the one near the eye. In this movement the stick's image will grow progressively shorter; its farther end will appear less and less separated laterally from its fixed near end; soon it will be screened by the latter, and then reappear on the opposite side, and finally on that side resume its original length. Suppose this movement to become a familiar experience; the mind will presumably react upon it after its usual fashion (which is that of unifying all data which it is in any way possible to unify), and consider it the movement of a constant object rather than the transformation of a fluctuating one. Now, the sensation of depth which it receives during the experience is awakened more by the far than by the near end of the object. But how much depth? What shall measure its amount? Why, at the moment the far end is ready to be eclipsed, the difference of its distance from the near end's distance must be judged equal to the stick's whole length; but that length has already been judged equal to a certain optical sensation of breadth. Thus we find that given amounts of the visual depth-feeling become signs of given amounts of the visual depth-feeling. The measurement of distance is, as Berkeley truly said, a result of suggestion and experience. But visual experience alone is adequate to produce it, and this he erroneously denied.\n\nSuppose a colonel in front of his regiment at dress-parade, and suppose he walks at right angles towards the midmost mall of the line. As he advances, and surveys the line in either direction, he looks more and more down it and less and less at it, until, when abreast of the midmost man, he feels the end men to be most distant; then when the line casts hardly any lateral image on his retina at all, what distance shall lie judge to be that of the end men? Why, half the length of the regiment as it was originally seen, of course; but this length was a moment ago a retinal object spread out laterally before his sight. He has now merely equated a retinal depth-feeling with a retinal breadth-feeling. If the regiment moved, and the near end of the object. colonel stood still, the result would be the same. In such ways as these a creature endowed with eyes alone could hardly fail of measuring out all three dimensions of the space he inhabited. And we ourselves, I think, although we may often 'realize' distance in locomotor terms (as Berkeley says we must always do), yet do so no less often in terms of our retinal map, and always in this the more spontaneously. Were this not so, the three visual dimensions could not possibly feel to us as homogeneous as they do, nor as commensurable inter se.\n\nLet us then admit distance to be at least as genuinely optical a content of consciousness as either height or breadth. The question immediately returns, Can any of them be said in any strictness to be optical sensations? We have contended all along for the affirmative reply to this question, but must now cope with difficulties greater than any that have assailed us hitherto.\n\nHelmholtz and Reid on Sensations.\n\nA sensation is, as we have seen in Chapter XVII, the mental affection that follows most immediately upon the stimulation of the sense-tract. Its antecedent is directly physical, no psychic links, no acts of memory, inference, or association intervening. Accordingly, if suppose the nexus between neural process in the sense-organ, on the one hand, and conscious affection, on the other, to be by nature uniform, the same process ought always to give the same sensation; and conversely, if what seems to be a sensation varies whilst the process in the sense-organ remains unchanged, the reason is presumably that it is really not a sensation but a higher mental product, whereof the variations depend on events occurring in the system of higher cerebral centres.\n\nNow the size of the field of view varies enormously in all three dimensions, without our being able to assign with any definiteness the process in the visual tract on which the variation depends. We just saw how impossible such assignment was in the case where turning down the head produces the enlargement. In general, the maximum feeling of depth or distance seems to take the lead in determining the apparent magnitude of the whole field, and the two other dimensions seem to follow. If, to use the former instance, I look close into a wash-basin, the lateral extent of the field shrinks proportionately to its nearness. If I look from a mountain, the things seen are vast in height and breadth, in proportion to the farness of the horizon. But when we ask what changes in the eye determine how great this maximum feeling of depth or distance (which is undoubtedly felt as a unitary vastness) shall be, we find ourselves unable to point to any one of them as being its absolutely regular concomitant. Convergence, accommodation, double and disparate images, differences in the parallactic displacement when we move our head, faintness of tint, dimness of outline, and smallness of the retinal image of objects named and known, are all processes that have something to do with the perception of 'far' and of 'near'; but the effect of each and ally one of them in determining such a perception at one moment may at another moment be reversed by the presence of some other sensible quality in the object, that makes us, evidently by reminding us of past experience, judge it to be at a different distance and of another shape. If we paint the inside of a pasteboard-mask like the outside, and look at it with one eye, the accommodation- and parallax-feelings ape there, but fail to make us see it hollow, as it is. Our mental knowledge of the fact that human faces are always convex overpowers them, and we directly perceive the nose to be nearer to us than the cheek instead of farther of.\n\nThe other organic tokens of farness and nearness are proved by similar experiments (of which we shall ere long speak more in detail) to have an equally fluctuating import. They lose all their value whenever the collateral circumstances favor a strong intellectual conviction that the object presented to the gaze is improbable -- cannot be either what or where they would make us perceive it to be.\n\nNow the query immediately arises: Can the feelings of these processes in the eye, since they are so easily neutralized and reversed by intellectual suggestions, ever have been direct sensations of distance at all? Ought we not rather to assume, since the distances which me see in spite of them are conclusions from past experience, that the distances which we see by means of them are equally such conclusions? Ought we not, in short, to say \"unhesitatingly that distance must be an intellectual and not a sensible content of consciousness? and that each of these eye-feelings serves as a mere signal to awaken this content, our intellect being so framed that sometimes it notices one signal more readily and sometimes another?\n\nReid long ago (Inquiry, c. vi sec. 17) said:\n\n\"It may be taken for a general rule that things which are produced by custom may be undone or changed by disuse or by contrary custom. On the other hand, it is a strong argument that an effect is not owning to custom, but to the constitution of nature, when a contrary custom is found neither nor to weaken it.\"\n\nMore briefly, a way of seeing things that can be unlearned was presumably learned, and only what we cannot unlearn is instinctive.\n\nThis seems to be Helmholtz's view, for he confirms Reid's maxim by saying in emphatic print:\n\n\"No elements in our perception can he sensational which may be overcome or reversed by factors of demonstrably experimental origin. Whatever can be overcome by suggestions of experience must be regarded as itself a product of experience and custom. If we follow this rule it will appear that only qualities are sensational, whilst almost all spatial attributes are results of habit and experience.\" [74]\n\nThis passage of Helmholtz's has obtained, it seems to me, an almost deplorable celebrity. The reader will please observe its very radical import. Not only would he, and does he, for the reasons we have just been ourselves considering, deny distance to be an optical sensation; but, extending the same method of criticism to judgments of size, shape, and direction, and finding no single retinal or muscular process in the eyes to be indissolubly linked with any one of these, he goes so far as to say that all optical space-perceptions whatsoever must have an intellectual origin, and a content that no items of visual sensibility can account for. [75]\n\nAs Wundt and others agree with Helmholtz here, and as their conclusions, if true, are irreconcilable with all the sensationalism which I have been teaching hitherto, it clearly devolves upon me to defend my position against this new attack. But as this chapter on Space is already so overgrown with episodes and details, I think it best to reserve the refutation of their general principle for the next chapter, and simply to assume at this point its untenability. This has of course an arrogant look; but if the reader will bear with me for not very many pages more, I shall hope to appease his mind. Meanwhile I affirm confidently that the same outer objects actually FEEL different to us according as our brain reacts on them in one way or another by making us perceive them as this or as that sort of thing. So true is this that one may well, with Stumpf, [76] reverse Helmholtz's query, and ask: \"What would become of our sense-perceptions in case experience were not able so to transform them ?\" Stumpf adds: \"All wrong perceptions that depend on peculiarities in the organs are more or less perfectly corrected by the influence of imagination following the guidance of experience.\"\n\nIf, therefore, among the facts of optical space-perception (which we must now proceed to consider in more detail) we find instances of an identical organic eye-process, giving us different perceptions at different times, in consequence of different collateral circumstances suggesting different objective facts to our imagination, we must not hastily conclude, with the school of Helmholtz and Wundt, that the organic eye-process pure and simple, without the collateral circumstances, is incapable of giving us any sensation of a spatial kind at all. We must rather seek to discover by what means the circumstances can so have transformed a space-sensation, which, but for their presence, would probably have been felt in its natural purity. And I may as well say now in advance that we shall find the means to be nothing more or less than association -- the suggestion to the mind of optical objects not actually present, but more habitually associated with the 'collateral circumstances' than the sensation which they now displace and being imagined now with a quasi-hallucinatory strength. But before this conclusion emerges, it will be necessary to have reviewed the most important facts of optical space-perception, in relation to the organic conditions on which they depend. Readers acquainted with German optics will excuse what is already familiar to them in the following section. [77] Let us begin the long and rather tedious inquiry by the most important case. Physiologists have long sought for a simple law by which to connect the seen direction and distance of objects with the retinal impressions they produce. Two principal theories have been held of this matter, the 'theory of identical points', and the 'theory of projection' -- each incompatible with each other, and each beyond certain limits becoming inconsistent with the facts.\n\nThe Theory of Identical Points.\n\nThis theory starts from the truth that on both retin\u00e6 an impression on the upper half makes us perceive an object as below, on the lower half as above, the horizon; and\n\non the right half an object to the left, on the left half one to the right, of the median line. Thus each quadrant of one retina corresponds as a whole to the similar quadrant of the other; and within two similar quadrants, al and ar for example, there should, if the correspondence were consistently carried out, be geometrically similar points which, if impressed at the same time by light emitted from the same object, should cause that object to appear in the same direction to either eye. Experiment verifies this surmise. I we look at the starry vault with parallel eyes, the stars all seem single; and the laws of perspective show that under the circumstances the parallel light-rays coming from each star must impinge on points within either retina which are geometrically similar to each other. The same result may be more artificially obtained. If we take two exactly similar pictures, smaller, or at least no larger, than those on an ordinary stereoscopic slide, and if we look at them as stereoscopic slides are looked at, that is, at one with each eye (a median partition confining the view of either eye to the picture opposite it), we shall see but one flat picture, all of whose parts appear sharp and single. [78] Identical points being impressed, both eyes see their object in the same direction, and the two objects consequently coalesce into one.\n\nThe same thing may be shown in still another way. With fixed head converge the eyes upon some conspicuous objective point behind a pane of glass; then close either eye alternately and make a little ink-mark on the glass, 'covering' the object as seen by the eye which is momentarily open. On looking now with both eyes the ink-marks will seem single, and in the same direction as the objective point. Conversely, let the eyes converge on a single ink- spot on the glass, and then by alternate shutting of them let it be noted what objects behind the glass the spot covers to the right and left eye respectively. Now with both eyes open, both these objects and the spot will appear in the same place, one or other of the three becoming distinct according to the fluctuations of retinal attention. [79]\n\nNow what is the direction of this common place? The only way of defining the direction of an object is by pointing to it. Most people, if asked to look at an object over the horizontal edge of a sheet of paper which conceals their hand and arm, and then to point their finger at it (raising the hand gradually so that at lest a finger-tip will appear above the sheet of paper), are found to place the finger not between either eye and the object, but between the latter and the root of the nose, and this whether both eyes or either alone be used. Hering and Helmholtz express this by saying that we judge of the direction of objects as they would appear to an imaginary cyclopean eye, situated between our two real eyes, and with its optical axis bisecting the angle of convergence of the latter. Our two retin\u00e6 act, according to Hering, as if they were superposed in the place of this Imaginary double-eye; we see by the corresponding points of each, situated far asunder as they really are, just as we should see if they were superposed and could both be excited together.\n\nThe judgment of objective singleness and that of identical direction seem to hang necessarily together. And that of identical direction seems to carry with it the necessity of a common origin, between the eyes or elsewhere, from which all the directions felt may seem to be estimated. This is why the cyclopean eye is really a fundamental part of the formulation of the theory of identical retinal points, and why Hering, the greatest champion of this theory, lays so much stress upon it.\n\nIt is an immediate consequence of the law of identical pro- projection of images on geometrically similar points that images which fall upon geometrically DISPARATE points of the two retin\u00e6 should be projected in DISPARATE directions, and that their objects should consequently appear in TWO places, or LOOK DOUBLE. Take the parallel rays from a star falling upon two eyes which converge upon a near object, 0, instead of being parallel, as in the previously instanced case. If SL and SR in Fig. 55 be the parallel rays, each of them will fall upon the nasal half of the retina which it strikes.\n\nBut the two nasal halves are disparate, geometrically symmetrical, not geometrically similar. The image on the left one will therefore appear as if lying in a direction leftward of the cyclopean eye's line of sight; the image of the right one will appear far to the right of the same direction. The star will, in short, be seen double, -- 'homonymously' double.\n\nConversely, if the star be looked at directly with parallel axes, O will be seen double, because its images will effect the outer or cheek halves of the two retin\u00e6, instead of one outer and one nasal half. The position of the images will here be reversed from that of the previous case. The right eye's image will now appear to the left, the left eye's to the right -- the double images will be 'heteronymous.'\n\nThe same reasoning and the same result ought to apply where the object's place with respect to the direction of the two optic axes is such as to make its images fall not on non-similar retinal halves, but on non-similar parts of similar halves. Here, of course, the directions of projection will be less widely disparate than in the other case, and the double images will appear to lie less widely apart.\n\nCareful experiments made by many observers according to the so-called haploscopic method confirm this law, and show that corresponding points of single visual direction, exist upon the two retin\u00e6. For the detail of these one must consult the special treatises.\n\nNote now an important consequence, If we take a stationary object and allow the eyes to vary their direction and convergence, a purely geometrical study will show that there will be some positions in which its two images impress corresponding retinal points, but more in which they impress disparate points. The former constitute the so-called horopter, and their discovery has been attended with great mathematical difficulty. Objects or parts of objects which lie in the eyes' horopter at any given time cannot appear double. Objects lying out of the horopter would seem, if the theory of identical points were strictly true, necessarily and always to appear double.\n\nHere comes the first great conflict of the identity-theory with experience. Were the theory true, we ought ail to have an intuitive knowledge of the horopter as the line of distinctest vision. Objects placed elsewhere ought to seem, if not actually double, at least blurred. And yet no living man makes any such distinction between the parts of his field of vision. To most of us the whole field appears single, and it is only by rare accident or by special education that we ever catch a glimpse of a double image. In 1838, Wheatstone, in his truly classical memoir on binocular vision and the stereoscope, [80] showed that the disparateness of the points on which the two images of an object fall does not within certain limits affect its seen singleness at all, but rather the distance at which it shell appear. Wheatstone made an observation, moreover, which subsequently became the bone of much hot contention, in which he strove to show that not only might disparate images fuse, but images on corresponding or identical points might be seen double. [81]\n\nI am unfortunately prevented by the weakness of my own eyes from experimenting enough to form a decided personal opinion on the matter. It seems to me, however, that the balance of evidence is against the Wheatstonian interpretation, and that disparate points may fuse, without identical points for that reason ever giving double images. The two questions, \"Can we see single with disparate points?\" and \"Can we see double with identical points?\" although at the first blush they may appear, as to Helmholtz they appear, to be but two modes of expressing the same inquiry, are in reality distinct. The first may quite well be answered affirmatively and the second negatively.\n\nAdd to this that the experiment quoted from Helmholtz above by no means always succeeds, but that many individuals place their finger between the object and one of their eyes, oftenest the right; [82] finally, observe that the identity-theory, with its Cyclopean starting point for all lines of direction, gives by itself no ground for the distance on any line at which an object shall appear, and has to be helped out in this respect by subsidiary hypotheses, which, in the hands of Hering and others, have become so complex as easily to fall a prey to critical attacks; and it will soon seem as if the law of identical seen directions by corresponding points, although a simple formula for expressing concisely many fundamental phenomena, is by no means an adequate account of the whole matter of retinal perception. [83]\n\nThe Projection-Theory.\n\nDoes the theory of projection fare any better? This theory admits that each eye sees the object in a different direction from the other, along the line, namely, passing from the object through the middle of the pupil to the retina. A point directly which these two optical axes have in common, and that is the point to which they converge. Everything directly looked at is seen at this point, and is thus seen both single and at its proper distance. It is easy to show the incompatibility of this theory with the theory of identity. Take an objective point (like O in Fig. 50, when the star is looked at) casting its images R' and L' on geometrically dissimilar parts of the two retin\u00e6 and affecting the outer half of each eye. On the identity-theory it ought necessarily to appear double, whilst on the projection-theory there is no reason whatever why it should not appear single, provided only it be located by the judgment on each line of visible direc- tion, neither nearer nor farther than its point of intersection with the other line.\n\nEvery point in the field of view ought, in truth, if the projection-theory were uniformly valid, to appear single, entirely irrespective of the varying positions of the eyes, for from every point of space two lines of visible direction pass to the two retin\u00e6 and at the intersection of these lines, or just where the point is, there, according to the theory, it should appear. The objection to this theory is thus precisely the reverse of the objection to the identity-theory. If the latter ruled, we ought to see most things double all the time. If the projection-theory ruled, we ought never to see anything double. As a matter of fact we get too few double images for the identity-theory, and too many for the projection-theory.\n\nThe partisans of the projection-theory, beginning with\n\nAguilonius, have always explained double images as the result of an erroneous judgment of the distance of the object, the images of the latter being projected by the imagination along the two lines of visible direction either nearer or farther than the point of intersection of the latter. diagram will make this clear.\n\nLet O be the point looked at, M an object farther, and N an object nearer, than it. Then M and N will send the lines of visible direction MM and NN to the two retin\u00e6. If N be judged as far as O, it must necessarily lie where the two lines of visible direction NN intersect the plane of the arrow, or in two places, at N' and at N\". If M be judged as near as O, it must for the same reason form two images at M' and M\".\n\nIt is, as a matter of fact, true that we often misjudge the distance in the way alleged. If the reader will hold his forefingers, one beyond the other, in the median line, and fixate them alternately, he will see the one not looked at, double; and he will also notice that it appears nearer to the plane of the one looked at, whichever the latter may be, than it really is. Its changes of apparent size, as the convergence of the eyes, alter also prove the change of apparent distance. The distance at which the axes converge seems, in fact, to exert a sort of attraction upon objects situated elsewhere. Being the distance of which we are most acutely sensible, it invades, so to speak, the whole held of our perception. If two half-dollars be laid on the table an inch or two apart, and the eyes fixate steadily the point of a pen held in the median line at varying distances between the coins and the face, there will come a distance at which the pen stands between the left half-dollar and the right eye, and the right half-dollar and the left eye. The two half-dollars will then coalesce into one; and this one will show its apparent approach to the pen-point by seeming Suddenly much reduced in size. [84]\n\nYet, in spite of this tendency to inaccuracy we are never actually mistaken about the half-dollar being behind the pen-point. It may not seem far enough off, but still it is farther than the point. In general it may be said that where the objects are known to us, no such inclusion of distance occurs in any one as the theory would require. And in some observers, Hering for example, it seems hardly to occur at all. If I look into infinite distance and get my finger in double images, they do not seem infinitely far off. To make objects at different distances seem equidistant, careful precautions must be taken to have them alike in appearance, and to exclude all outward reasons for ascribing to the one a different location from that ascribed to the other. Thus Donders tries to prove the law of projection by taking two similar electric sparks, one behind the other on a dark ground, one seen double; or an iron rod placed so near to the eyes that its double images seem as broad as that of a fixated stove-pipe, the top and bottom of the objects being cut off by screens, so as to prevent all suggestions of perspective, etc. The three objects in each experiment seem in the same plane. [85]\n\nAdd to this the impossibility, recognized by all observers, of ever seeing double with the fove\u00e6, and the fact that authorities as able as those quoted in the note on Wheatstone's observation deny that they can see double then with identical points, and we are forced to conclude that the projection-theory, like its predecessor, breaks down. Neither formulates exactly or exhaustively a law for all our perceptions. Ambiguity of Retinal Impressions.\n\nWhat does each theory try to do? To make of seen location a fixed function of retinal impressions. Other facts may be\n\nbrought forward to show how far from fixed are the perceptive functions of retinal impressions. We alluded a while ago to the extraordinary ambiguity of the retinal image as a revealer of magnitude. Produce an after-image of the sun and look at your finger-tip : it will be smaller than your nail. Project it on the table, and it will be as big as a strawberry; on the wall, as large as a plate; on yonder mountain, bigger than a house. And yet it is an unchanged retinal impression. Prepare a sheet with the figures shown in Fig. 57 strongly marked upon it, and get by direct fixation a distinct after-image of each.\n\nProject the after-image of the cross upon the upper left- hand part of the well, it min appear as in Fig. 58; on the upper right-hand it will appear as in Fig. 59. The circle\n\nsimilarly projected will be distorted into two different ellipses. If the two parallel lines be projected upon the ceiling or floor far in front, the farther ends will diverge; and if the three parallel lines be thrown on the same surfaces, the upper pair will seem farther apart than the lower. Adding certain lines to others has the same distorting effect. In what is known as Z\u00f6llner's pattern (Pig. 60), the long parallels tip towards each other the moment we draw the short slanting lines over them yet their retinal images\n\nare the same they always were. A similar distortion of parallels appears in Pig 61. Drawing a square inside the circle (Fig. 52) gives to the outline of the latter an indented appearance where the square's corners touch it. Drawing the radii of one\n\nof the right angles in the same figure makes it seem larger than the other. In Fig. 63, the retinal image of the space between the extreme dots is in all three lines the same, yet it seems much larger the moment it is filled up with other dots.\n\nIn the stereoscope certain pairs of lines which look single under ordinary circumstances immediately seem double when we add certain other lines to them. [86]\n\nAmbiguous Import of Eye-movements.\n\nThese facts show the indeterminateness of the space-import of various retinal impressions. Take now the eye's movements, and we find a similar vacillation. When we follow a moving object with our gaze, the motion is 'voluntary'; when our eyes oscillate to and fro after we have made ourselves dizzy by spinning around, it is 'reflex'; and when the eyeball is pushed with the finger, it is 'passive.' Now, in all three of these cases we get a feeling from the movement as it effects itself. But the objective perceptions to which the feeling assists us are by no means the same. In the worst case we may see a stationary field of view with one moving object in it; in the second, the total held swimming more or less steadily in one direction in the third, a sudden lump or twist of the same total held.\n\nThe feelings of convergence of the eyeballs permit of the same ambiguous interpretation. When objects are near we converge strongly upon them in order to see them; when far, we set our optic axes parallel. But the exact degree of convergence fails to be felt; or rather, being felt, fails to tell us the absolute distance of the object we are regarding. Wheatstone arranged his stereoscope in such a way that the size of the retinal images might change without the convergence altering; or conversely, the convergence might change without the retinal image altering. Under these circumstances, he says, [87] the object seemed to approach or recede in the first case, without altering its size; in the second, to change its size without altering its distance -- just But the objective total same the reverse of what might have been expected. Wheatstone adds, however, that 'fixing the attention' converted each of these perceptions into its opposite. The same perplexity occurs in looking through prismatic glasses, which alter the eyes' convergence. He cannot decide whether the object has come nearer, or grown larger, or both, or neither; and our judgment vacillates in the most surprising way. We may even make our eyes diverge, and the object will none the less appear at a definite distance. When we look through the stereoscope, the picture seems at no determinate distance. These and other facts have led Helmholtz to deny that the feeling of convergence has any very exact value as a distance-measurer. [88]\n\nWith the feelings of accommodation it is very much the same. Donders has shown [89] that the apparent magnifying power of spectacles of moderate convexity hardly depends at all upon their enlargement of the retinal image, but rather on the relaxation they permit of the muscle of accommodation. This suggests an object farther off, and consequently a much larger one, since its retinal size rather increases than diminishes. But in this case the same vacillation of judgment as in the previously mentioned case of convergence takes place. The recession made the object seem larger, but the apparent growth in size of the object now makes it look as if it came nearer instead of receding. The effect thus contradicts its own cause. Everyone is conscious, on first putting on a pair of spectacles, of a doubt whether the field of view draws near or retreats. [90]\n\nThere is still another deception, occurring in persons who have had one eye-muscle suddenly paralyzed. has led Wundt to affirm that the eyeball-feeling proper, the incoming sensation of effected rotation, tells us only of the direction of our eye-movements, but not of their whole extent. [91] For this reason, and because not only Wundt, but many other authors, think the phenomena in these partial paralyses demonstrate the existence of a feeling of innervation, a feeling of the outgoing nervous current, opposed to every different sensation whatever, it seems proper to note the facts with a certain degree of detail.\n\nSuppose a man wakes up some morning with the external rectus muscle of his right eye half paralyzed, what will be the result? He will be enabled only with great effort to rotate the eye so as to look at objects lying far off to the right. Something in the effort he makes will make him feel as if the object lay much farther to the right than it really is. If the left and sound eye be closed, and he be asked to touch rapidly with his finger an object situated towards his right, he will point the finger to the right of it. The current explanation of the 'something' in the effort which causes this deception is that it is the sensation of the outgoing discharge from the nervous centres, the 'feeling of innervation,' to use Wundt's expression, requisite for bringing the open eye with its weakened muscle to bear upon the object to be touched. If that object be situated 20 degrees to the right, the patient has now to innervate as powerfully to turn the eye those 20 degrees as formerly he did to turn the eye 30 degrees. He consequently believes as before that he has turned it 30 degrees; until, by a newly-acquired custom, he learns the altered spatial import of all the discharges his brain makes into his right abducens nerve. The 'feeling of innervation' maintained to exist by this and other observations, plays an immense part in the space-theories of certain philosophers, especially Wundt. I shall elsewhere try to show that the observations by no means warrant the conclusions drawn from them, and that the feeling in question is probably a wholly fictitious entity. [92] Meanwhile it suffices to point out that even those who set most store by it are compelled, by the readiness with which the translocation of the field of view becomes corrected and further errors avoided, to admit that the precise space-import of the supposed sensation of outgoing energy is as ambiguous and indeterminate as that of any other of the eye-feelings we have considered hitherto.\n\nI have now given what no one will call an understatement of the facts and arguments by which it is sought to banish the credit of directly revealing space from each and every kind of eye-sensation taken by itself. The reader will confess that they make a very plausible show, and most likely wonder whether my own theory of the matter can rally from their damaging evidence. But the case is far from being hopeless; and the introduction of a discrimination hitherto unmade will, if I mistake not, easily vindicate the view adopted in these pages, Whilst at the same time it makes ungrudging allowance for all the ambiguity and illusion on which so much stress is laid by the advocates of the intellectualist-theory.\n\nThe Choice of the Visual Reality.\n\nWe have native and fixed optical space-sensations; but experience leads us to select certain one from among them to be the exclusive bearers of reality: the rest become mere signs and suggesters of these. The factor of selection, on which we have already laid so much stress, here as elsewhere is the solving word of the enigma. If Helmholtz, Wundt, and the rest, with an ambiguous retinal sensation before them, meaning now one size and distance, and now another, had not contented themselves with merely saying: -- The size and distance are not this sensation, they are something beyond it which it merely calls up, and whose own birthplace is afar -- in 'synthesis' (Wundt) or in 'experience' (Helmholtz) as the case may be; if they had gone on definitely to ask and definitely to answer the question, What are the size and distance in their proper selves? they would not only have escaped the present deplorable vagueness of their space-theories, but they would have seen that the objective spatial attributes 'signified' are simply and solely certain other optical sensations now absent, but which the present sensations suggest.\n\nWhat, for example, is the slant-legged cross which we think we see on the well when we project the rectangular after-image high up towards our right or left (Figs. 58 and 59)? Is it not in very sooth a retinal sensation itself ? An imagined sensation, not a felt one, it is true, but none the less essentially and originally sensational or retinal for that, -- the sensation, namely, which we should receive if a 'real' slant-legged cross stood on the wall in front of us and threw its image on our eye. That image is not the one our retina now holds. Our retina now holds the image which a cross of square shape throws when in front, but which a cross of the slant-legged pattern would throw, provided it were actually on the wall in the distant place at which we look. Call this actual retinal image the 'square' image. The square image is then one of the innumerable images the slant-legged cross can throw Why should another one, and that an absent one, of those innumerable images be picked out to represent exclusively the slant-legged cross's 'true' shape? Why should that absent and imagined slant-legged image displace the present and felt square image from our mind? Why, when the objective cross gives us so many shapes, as it varies its position, should we think we feel the true shape only when the cross is directly in front? And when that question is answered, how can the absent and represented feeling of a slant-legged figure so successfully intrude itself into the place of a presented square one?\n\nBefore answering either question, let us be doubly sure about our facts, and see how true it is that in our dealings with objects we always do pick out one of the visual images they yield, to constitute the real form or size.\n\nThe matter of size has been already touched upon, so that no more need be said of it here. As regards shape, almost all the retinal shapes that objects throw are perspective 'distortions.' Square table-tops constantly present two acute and two obtuse angles; circles drawn on our wall-papers, our carpets, or on sheets of paper, usually show like ellipses; parallels approach as they recede; human bodies are foreshortened; and the transitions from one to another of these altering forms are infinite and continual. Out of the flux, however, one phase always stands prominent. It is the form the object has when we see it easiest and best: and that is when our eyes and the object both are in what may be called the normal position. In this position our head is upright and our optic axes either parallel or symmetrically convergent; the plane of the object is perpendicular to the visual plane; and if the object is one containing many lines it is turned so as to make them, as far as possible, either parallel or perpendicular to the visual plane. In this situation it is that we compare all shapes with each other; here every exact measurement and decision is made. [93]\n\nIt is very easy to see why the normal situation should have this extraordinary pre-eminence. First, it is the position in which we easiest hold anything we are examining in our hands; second, it is a turning-point between all right- and all left-hand perspective views of a given object; third, it is the only position in which symmetrical figures seem symmetrical and equal angles seem equal; fourth, it is often that starting-point of movements from which the eye is least troubled by axial rotations, by which superposition [94] of the retinal images of different lines and different parts of the same line is easiest produced, and consequently by which the eye can make the best comparative measurements in its sweeps. All these merits single the normal position out to be chosen. No other point of view offers so many aesthetic and practical advantages. Here we believe we see the object as it is; elsewhere, only as it seems. Experience and custom soon teach us, however, that the seeming appearance passes into the real one by continuous gradations. They teach us, moreover, that seeming and being may be strangely interchanged. Now a real circle may slide into a seeming ellipse; now an ellipse may, by sliding in the same direction, become a seeming circle; now a rectangular cross grows slant-legged; now a slant-legged one grows rectangular.\n\nAlmost any form in oblique vision may be thus a derivative of almost any other in 'primary' vision; and we must learn, when we get one of the former appearance, to translate it into the appropriate one of the latter class; we must learn of what optical 'reality' it is one of the optical signs. Having learned this, me do but obey that law of economy or simplification which dominates our whole psychic life, when we attend exclusively to the 'reality' and ignore as much as our consciousness will let us the 'sign' by which we came to apprehend it. The signs of each probable real thing being multiple and the thing itself one and fixed, we gain the same mental relief by abandoning the former for the latter that we do when we abandon mental images, with all their fluctuating characters, for the definite and unchangeable names which they suggest. The selection of the several 'normal' appearances from out of the jungle of our optical experiences, to serve as the real sights of which we shall think, is psychologically a, parallel phenomenon to the habit of thinking in words, and has a like use. Both are substitutions of terms few and fixed for terms manifold and vague. Sensations which we Ignore.\n\nThis service of sensations as mere signs, to be ignored when they have evoked the other sensations which are their significates, was noticed first by Berkeley and remarked in many passages, as the following:\n\n\"Signs, being little considered in themselves, or for their own sake, but only in their relative capacity and for the sake of those things whereof they are signs, it comes to pass that the mind overlooks them, so as to carry its attention immediately on to the things signified... which in truth and strictness are not seen, but only suggested and apprehended by means of the proper objects of sight which alone are seen.\" (Divine Visual Language, &\u00a712.)\n\nBerkeley of course erred in supposing that the thing suggested was not even originally an object of sight, as the sign now is which calls it up. Reid expressed Berkeley's principle in yet clearer language:\n\n\" The visible appearances of objects are intended by nature only as signs or indications, and the mind passes instantly to the things sig- nified, without making the least reflection upon the sign, or even perceiving that there is any such thing.... The mind has acquired a confirmed and inveterate habit of inattention to them (the signs). For they no sooner appear than, quick as lightning, the thing signified succeeds and engrosses all our regard. They have no name in language; and although we are conscious of them when they pass through the mind, yet their passage is so quick and so familiar that it is absolutely unheeded; nor do they leave any footsteps of themselves, either in the memory or imagination.\" (Inquiry, chap. v. &\u00a7&\u00a72, 3.)\n\nIf we review the facts we shall find every grade of non-attention between the extreme form of overlooking mentioned by Reid (or forms even more extreme still) and complete conscious perception of the sensation present. Sometimes it is literally impossible to become aware of the latter. Sometimes a little artifice or effort easily leads us to discern it together, or in alternation, with the 'object' it reveals. Sometimes the present sensation is held to be the object or to reproduce its features in undistorted shape, and then, of course, it receives the mind's full glare.\n\nThe deepest inattention is to subjective optical sensations, strictly so called, or those which are not signs of outer objects at all. Helmholtz's treatment of these phenomena, musc\u00e6 volitantes, negative after-images, double images, etc., is very satisfactory. He says:\n\n\" We only attend with any ease and exactness to our sensations in so far forth as they can be utilized for the knowledge of outward things; and we are accustomed to neglect all those portions of them which have no significance as regards the external world. So much is this the case that for the most part special artifices and practice are required for the observation of these latter more subjective feelings. Although it might seem that nothing should be easier than to be conscious of one's own sensations, experience nevertheless shows that often enough either a special talent like that showed in eminent degree by Purkinje, or accident or theoretic speculation, are necessary conditions for the discovery of subjective phenomena. Thus, for example, the blind spot on the retina was discovered by Mariotte by the theoretic way ; similarly by me the existence of 'summation'-tones in acoustics. In the majority of cases accident is what first led observers whose attention was especially exercised on subjective phenomena to discover this one or that; only where the subjective appearances are so intense that they interfere with the perception of objects are they noticed by all men alike. But if they have once been discovered it is for the most part easy for subsequent observers who place themselves in proper conditions and bend their attention in the right direction to perceive them. But in many cases -- for example, in the phenomena of the blind spot, in the discrimination of over-tones and combination-tones from the ground- tone of musical sounds, etc. -- such a strain of the attention is required, even with appropriate instrumental aids, that most persons fail. The very after-images of bright objects are by most men perceived only under exceptionally favorable conditions, and it takes steady practice to see the fainter images of this kind. It is a, commonly recurring experience that persons smitten with some eye-disease which impairs vision suddenly remark for the first time the musc\u00e6 volitantes which all through life their vitreous humor has contained, but which they now firmly believe to have arisen since their malady; the truth being that the latter has only made them more observant of all their visual sensations. There are also cases where one eye has gradually grown blind, and the patient lived for an indefinite time without knowing it, until, through the accidental closure of the healthy eye alone, the blindness of the other was brought to attention.\n\n\"Most people, when first made aware of binocular double images, are uncommonly astonished that they should never have noticed them before, although all through their life they had been in the habit of seeing singly only those few objects which were about equally distant with the point of fixation, and the rest, those nearer and farther, which constitute the great majority, had always been double.\n\n\"We must then learn to turn our attention to our particular sensations, and we learn this commonly only for such sensations as are means of cognition of tile outer world. Only so far as they serve this end hale our sensations any importance for us in ordinary life. Subjective feelings are mostly interesting only to scientific investigators; were they remarked in the ordinary use of the senses, they could only cause disturbance. Whilst, therefore, we reach an extraordinary degree of dryness and security in objective observation, we not only do not reach this where subjective phenomena are concerned, but we actually attain in a high degree the faculty of overlooking these altogether, and keeping ourselves independent of their influence in judging of objects, even in cases where their strength might lend them easily to attract our attention.\" (Physiol. Optik, pp. 431-2.)\n\nEven where the sensation is not merely subjective, as in the cases of which Helmholtz speaks, but is a sign of something outward, we are also liable, as Reid says, to overlook its intrinsic quality and attend exclusively to the image of the 'thing' it suggests. But here everyone can easily notice the sensation itself if he will. Usually we see a sheet of paper as uniformly white, although a part of it may be in shadow. But we can in an instant, if we please, notice the shadow as local color. A man walking towards us does not usually seem to alter his size; but we can, by setting which impairs our attention in a peculiar way make him appear to do so. The whole education of the artist consists in his learning to see the presented signs as well as the represented things. No matter what the held of view means, he sees it also as it feels -- that is, as a collection of patches of color bounded by lines -- the whole terming an optical diagram of whose intrinsic proportions one who is not an artist has hardly a conscious inkling. The ordinary man's attention passes over them to their import; the artist's turns back and dwells upon them for their own sake. 'Don't draw the thing as it is, but as it looks!' is the endless advice of every teacher to his pupil; forgetting that what it 'is' is what it would also 'look,' provided it were placed in what we have called the 'normal' situation for vision. In this situation the sensation as 'sign' and the sensation as 'object' coalesce into one, and there is no contrast between them.\n\nSensations which seem Suppressed.\n\nBut a great difficulty has been made of certain peculiar cases which we must now turn to consider. They are cases in which a present sensation, whose existence is supposed to be proved by its outward conditions being there, seems absolutely suppressed or changed by the image of the 'thing' it suggests.\n\nThis matter carries us back to what was said on p. 218. The passage there quoted from Helmholtz refers to these cases. He thinks they conclusively disprove the original and intrinsic spatiality of any of our retinal sensations; for if such a one, actually present, had an immanent and essential space-determination of its own, that might well be added to and overlaid or even momentarily eclipsed by suggestions of its sensation, but how could it possibly be altered or completely suppressed thereby? Of actually present sensations, he says, being suppressed by suggestions of experience --\n\n\"We have not a single well-attested example. In all those illusions which are provoked by sensations in the absence of their usually exciting objects, the mistake never vanishes by the better understanding of the object really present, and by insight into the cause of deception. Phosphenes provoked by pressure on the eyeball, by traction on the entrance of the optic nerve, after-images, etc., remain projected into their apparent place in the held of vision, just as the image projected from a mirror's surface continues to be seen behind the mirror, although we know that to all these appearances no outward reality corresponds. True enough, we can remove our attention, and keep it removed, from sensations that have no reference to the outer world, those, e.g., of the weaker after-images, and of entoptic objects, etc.... But what would become of our perceptions at all if we had the power not only of ignoring, but of transforming into their opposites, any part of them that differed from that outward experience, the image of which, as that of a present reality, accompanies them in the mind ?\" [95]\n\nAnd again:\n\n\"On the analogy of all other experience, we should expect that the conquered feelings would persist to our perception, even if only in the shape of recognized illusions. But this is not the case. One does not see how the assumption of originally spatial sensations can explain our optical cognitions, when in the last resort those who believe in these very sensations and themselves obliged to assume that they are overcome by our better judgment, based on experience.\"\n\nThese words, coming from such a quarter, necessarily carry great weight. But the authority even of a Helmholtz ought not to shake one's critical composure. And the moment one abandons abstract generalities and comes to close quarters with the particulars, I think one easily sees that no such conclusions as those we have quoted follow from the latter. But probably to conduct the discussion we must divide the alleged instances into groups.\n\n(a) With Helmholtz, color-perception is equally with space-perception an intellectual affair. The so-called simultaneous color-contrast, by which one color modifies another alongside of which it is said, is explained by him as an unconscious inference. In Chapter XVII we discussed the color-contrast problem; the principles which applied to its solution will prove also applicable to part of the present problem. In my opinion, Hering has definitively proved that, when one color is laid beside another, it modifies the sensation of the latter, not by virtue of any mere mental suggestion, as Helmholtz would have it but by actually exciting a new nerve-process, to which the modified feeling of color immediately corresponds. The explanation is physiological, not psychological. The transformation of the original color by the inducing color is due to the disappearance of the physiological conditions under which the first color was produced, and to the induction, under the new conditions, of a genuine new sensation, with which the (suggestions of experience' have naught to do.\n\nThat processes in the visual apparatus propagate themselves laterally, if one may so express it, is also shown by the phenomena of contrast which occur after looking upon motions of various kinds. Here are a few examples. If, over the rail of a moving vessel, we look at the water rushing along the side, and then transfer our gaze to the deck, a band of planks will appear to us, moving in the opposite direction to that in which, a moment previously, we had been seeing the water move, whilst on either side of this band another band of planks will move as the water did. Looking at a waterfall, or at the road from out of a car-window in a moving train, produces the same illusion, which may be easily verified in the laboratory by a simple piece of apparatus. A board with a window five or six inches wide and of any convenient length is supported upright on two feet. On the back side of the board, above and below the window, are two rollers, one of which is provided with a crank. An endless band of any figured stuff is passed over these rollers (one of which can be so adjusted on its bearings as to keep the stuff always taut and not liable to slip), and the surface of the front board is also covered with stuff or paper of a nature to catch the eye. Turning the crank now sets the central band in continuous motion, whilst the margins of the field remain really at rest, but after a while appear moving in the contrary way. Stopping the crank results in an illusory appearance of motion in reverse directions all over the field.\n\nA disk with an Archimedean spiral drawn upon it, whirled round on an ordinary rotating machine, produces still more startling effects.\n\n\"If the revolution is in the direction in which the spiral line approaches the centre of the disk the entire surface of the latter seems to expand during revolution and to contract after it has ceased; and vice vers\u00e2 if the movement of revolution is in the opposite direction. If in the former case the eyes of the observers are turned from the rotating disk towards any familiar object -- e. g. the face of a friend -- the latter seems to contract or recede in a somewhat striking manner, and to expand or approach after the opposite motion of the spiral.\" [96]\n\nAn elementary form of these motor illusions seems to be the one described by Helmholtz on pp. 568-571 of his Optik. The motion of anything in the field of vision along an acute angle towards a straight line sensibly distorts\n\nthat line. Thus in Fig. 66: Let AB be a line drawn on paper, CDE the tracing made over this line by the point of a compass steadily followed by the eve, as it moves. As the compass-point passes from C to D, the line appears to move downwards; as it passes from D to E, the line appears to move upwards; at the same time the whole line seems to incline itself in the direction FG during the first half of the compass's movement; and in the direction HI during its last half; the change from one inclination to another being quite distinct as the compass-point passes over D.\n\nAny line across which we draw a pencil-point appears to be animated by a, rapid movement of its own towards the pencil-point. This apparent movement of both of two things in relative motion to each other, even when one of them is absolutely still, reminds us of the instances quoted from Vierordt on page 188, and seems to take us back to a primitive stage of perception, in which the discriminations we now make when we feel a movement have not yet been made. If we draw the point of a pencil through 'Z\u00f6llner's pattern' (Fig. 60, p. 232), and follow it with the eye, the whole figure becomes the scene of the most singular apparent unrest, of which Helmholtz has very carefully noted the conditions. The illusion of Z\u00f6llner's figure vanishes entirely, or almost so, with most people, if they steadily look at one point of it with an unmoving eye; and the same is the case with many other illusions.\n\nNow all these facts taken together seen, to show -- vaguely it is true, but certainly -- that present excitements and after- effects of former excitements may alter the result of processes occurring simultaneously at a distance from them in the retina or other portions of the apparatus for optical sensation. In the cases last considered, the moving eye, as it sweeps the fovea over certain parts of the figure, seems thereby to determine a modification in the feeling which the other parts confer, which modification is the figure's 'distortion.' It is true that this statement explains nothing. It only keeps the cases to which it applies from being explained spuriously. The spurious account of these illusions is that they are intellectual, not sensational, that they are secondary, not primary, mental facts. The distorted figure is said to be one which the mind is led to imagine, by falsely drawing an unconscious inference from certain premises of which it is not distinctly aware. And the imagined figure is supposed to be strong enough to suppress the perception of whatever real sensations there may be. But Helmholtz, Wundt, Delboeuf, Z\u00f6llner, and all the advocates of unconscious inference are at variance with each other when it comes to the question what these unconscious premises and inferences may be. That small angles look proportionally larger than larger ones is, in brief, the fundamental illusion to which almost all authors would reduce the peculiarity of Fig. 67, 89 of Figs. 60, 61, 62 (pp. 232, 233). This peculiarity of small angles is by Wundt treated as the case of a fined space seeming larger than an empty one, as in Fig. 68; and this, according to both Delboeuf and Wundt is owing to the fact that more muscular innervation is needed for the eye to traverse a filled space than so empty one, because the points and lines\n\nin the filled space inevitably arrest and constrain the eye, and this makes us feel as if it were doing more work, i.e. traversing a longer distance. [97] When, however, we recol-\n\nlect that muscular movements are positively proved to have no share in the waterfall and revolving-spirals illusions. and that it is hard to see how Wundt's and Delboeuf's particular form of muscle-explanation can possibly apply to the compass-point illusion considered a moment ago, we must conclude that these writers have probably exaggerated, to say the least, the reach of their muscle-explanation in the case of the subdivided angles and lines. Never do we get such strong muscular feelings as when, against the course of nature, we oblige our eyes to be still; but fixing the eyes on one point of the figure, so far from making that part of the latter seem larger, dispels, in most persons, the illusion of these diagrams altogether.\n\nAs for Helmholtz, he invokes, to explain the enlargement of small angles, [98] what he calls a 'law of contrast' between directions and distances of lines, analogous to that between colors and intensities of light. Lines cutting another line make the latter seem more inclined away from them than it really is. Moreover, clearly recognizable magnitudes appear greater than equal magnitudes which we but vaguely apprehend. But this is surely a sensationalistic law, a native function of our seeing-apparatus, Quite as little as the negative after-image of the revolving spiral could such contrast be deduced from any association of ideas or recall of past objects. The principle of contrast is criticised by Wundt, [99] who says that by it small spaces ought to appear to us smaller, and not larger, than they really are. Helmholtz might have retorted (had not the retort been as fatal to the uniformity of his own principle as to Wundt's) that if the muscle-explanation were true, it ought not to give rise to just the opposite illusions in the skin. We saw on p. 141 that subdivided spaces appear shorter than empty ones upon the skin. To the instances there given add this: Divide a line on paper into equal halves, puncture the extremities, and make punctures all along one of the halves; then, with the finger-tip on the opposite side of the paper, follow the line of punctures, the empty half will seem much longer than the punctured half. This seems to bring things back to unanalyzable laws, by reason of which our feeling of size is determined differently in the skin and in the retina, even when the objective conditions are the same. Hering's explanation of Z\u00f6llner's figure is to be found in Hermann's Handb. d. Physiologie, III. I, p. 579. Lipps [100] gives another reason why lines cutting another line make the latter seem to bend away from them more than is really the case. If, he says, we draw (Fig. 69) the line pm upon the line ab, and follow the latter with our eye, we shall, on reaching the point m, tend for a moment to slip off ab and to follow mp, without distinctly realizing that we are not still on the main line. This makes us feel as if the remainder mb of the main line were bent a little away from its original direction. The illusion is apparent in the shape of a seeming\n\napproach of the ends b, b, of the two main lines. This to my mind would be a more satisfactory explanation of this class of illusions than any of those given by previous authors, were it not again for what happens in the skin.\n\nConsidering all the circumstances, I feel justified in, discarding his entire batch of illusions as irrelevant to our present inquiry. Whatever they may prove, they do not prove that our visual percepts of form and movement may not be sensations strictly so called. They much more probably fall into line with the phenomena of irradiation and of color-contrast, and with Vierordt's primitive illusions of movement. They show us, if anything, a, realm of sensations in which our habitual experience has not yet made traces, and which persist in spite of our better knowledge, unsuggestive of those other space-sensations which we all the time know from extrinsic evidence to constitute the real space-determinations of the diagram. Very likely, if these sensations were as frequent and as practically important as they now are insignificant and dare, we should end by substituting their significates -- the real space-values of the diagrams -- for them. These latter me should then seem to see directly, and the illusions would disappear like that of the side of a tooth-socket when the tooth has been out a week.\n\n(b) Another batch of cases which we may discard is that of double images. A thoroughgoing anti-sensationalist ought to deny all native tendency to see double images when disparate retinal points are stimulated, because, he should say, most people never get them, but see all things single which experience has led them to believe to be single. Can a doubleness, so easily neutralized by our knowledge, ever be a datum of sensation at all?\" such an anti-sensationalist might ask.\n\nTo which the answer is that it is a datum of sensation, but a datum which, like many other data, must first be discriminated. As a rule, no sensible qualities are discriminated without a motive. [101] And those that later we learn to discriminate were originally felt confused. As well pretend that a voice, or an odor, which we have learned to pick out, is no sensation now. One may easily acquire skin in discriminating double images, though, as Hering somewhere says, it is an art of which one cannot become master in one year or in two. For masters like Hering himself, or Le Conte, the ordinary stereoscopic diagrams are of little use. Instead of combining into one solid appearance, they simply cross each other with their doubled\n\nlines. Volkmann has shown a great variety of ways in which the addition of secondary lines, differing in the two fields, helps us to see the primary lines double. The effect is analogous to that shown in the cases which we despatched [sic] a moment ago, where given lines have their space-value changed by the addition of new lines, without our being able to say why, except that a certain mutual adhesion of the lines and modification of the resultant feeling takes place by psychophysiologica1 laws. Thus, if in Fig. 66, l and r be crossed by an horizontal line at the same level, and viewed stereoscopically, they appear as a single pair of lines, l, in space. But if the horizontal be at different levels, as in l', r', three lines appear, as in s'. [102] Let us then say no more about double images. All that the facts prove is what Volkmann says, [103] that, although there may be sets of retinal fibres so organized as to give an impression of two separate spots, yet the excitement of other retinal fibres may inhibit the effect of the first excitement, and prevent us from actually making the discrimination. Still farther retinal processes may, however, bring the doubleness to the eye of attention; and, once there, it is as genuine a sensation as any that our life affords. [104]\n\n(c) These groups of illusions being eliminated, either as cases of defective discrimination, or as changes of one space-sensation into another when the total retinal process changes, there remain but two other groups to puzzle us. The first is that of the after-images distorted by projection on to oblique planes; the second relates to the instability of our judgments of relative distance and size by the eye, and Includes especially what are known as pseudoscopic illusions.\n\nThe phenomena of the first group were described on page 232. A. W. Volkmann has studied them with his accustomed clearness and care. [105] Even an imaginarily inclined wall, in a picture, will, if an after-image be thrown upon it, distort the shape thereof, and make us see a form of which our after-image would be the natural projection on the retina, were that form laid upon the wall. Thus a, signboard is painted in perspective on a screen, and the eye, after steadily looking at a rectangular cross, is turned to the painted signboard. The after-image appears as an oblique-legged cross upon the signboard. It is the converse phenomenon of a perspective drawing like Fig. 71, in which\n\nreally oblique-legged figures are seen as rectangular crosses.\n\nThe unstable judgments of relative distance and size were also mentioned on pp. 231-2. Whatever the size may be of the retinal image which an object makes, the object is seen as of its own normal size. A man moving towards us is not sensibly perceived to grow, for example; and my finger, of which a single joint may more than conceal him from my view, is nevertheless seen as a much smaller object than the man. As for distances, it is often possible to make the farther part of an object seem near and the nearer part far. A human profile in intaglio, looked at steadily with one eye, or even both, soon appears irresistibly as a bas- relief. The inside of a common pasteboard mask, painted like the outside, and viewed with one eye in a direct light, also looks convex instead of hollow. So strong is the illu- sion, after long fixation, that a friend who painted such a mask for me told me it soon became difficult to see how to apply the brush. Bend a visiting-card across the middle, so that its halves form an angle of 90\u00b0 more or less; set it upright on the table, as in Fig. 72, and view it with one eye.\n\nYou can make it appear either as if it opened towards you or away from you. In the former case, the angle ab lies\n\nupon the table, b being nearer to you than a; in the latter case ab seems vertical to the table -- as indeed it really is -- with a nearer to you than b. [106] Again, look, with either one or two eyes, at the opening of a wine-glass or tumbler (Fig. 73), held either above or below the eye's level. The retinal image of the opening is an oval, but we can see the oval in either of two ways, as if it were the perspective view of a circle whose edge b were farther from us than its edge a (in which case we should seem to be looking down on the circle), or as if its edge a were the more distant edge (in which case we should be looking up at it through the b side of the glass). As the manner of seeing the edge changes, the glass itself alters its form in space and looks straight or seems bent towards or from the eye, [107] according as the latter is placed beneath or above it.\n\nPlane diagrams also can be conceived as solids, and that in more than one way. Figs. 74, 75, 76, for example, are am-\n\nbiguous perspective projections, and may each of them remind us of two different natural objects. Whichever of these objects we conceive clearly at the moment of looking at the figure, we seem to see in all its solidity before us. A little practice will enable us to flap the figures, so to speak, backwards end forwards from one object to the other at will. We need only attend to one of the angles represented, and imagine it either solid or hollow -- pulled towards us out of the plane of the paper, or pushed back behind the same -- and the whole figure obeys the cue and is instantaneously transformed beneath our gaze. [108]\n\nThe peculiarity of all these cases is the ambiguity of the perception to which the fixed retinal impression gives rise. With our retina excited in exactly the same way, whether by after-image, mask or diagram, we see now this object and now that, as if the retinal image per se had no essential space-import. Surely if form and length were originally retinal sensations, retinal rectangles ought not to become acute or obtuse, and lines ought not to alter their relative lengths as they do. If relief were an optical feeling, it ought not to flap to and fro, with every optical condition unchanged. Here, if anywhere, the deniers of space-sensation ought to be able to make their final stand. [109]\n\nIt must be confessed that their plea is plausible at first sight. But it is one thing to throw out retinal sensibility altogether as a space-yielding function the moment we find an ambiguity in its deliverances, and another thing to examine candidly the conditions which may have brought the ambiguity about. The former way is cheap, wholesale, shallow; the latter difficult and complicated, but full of instruction in the end. Let us try it for ourselves. In the case of the diagrams 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, the real object, lines meeting or crossing each other on a plane, is replaced by an imagined solid which we describe as seen. Really it is not seen but only so vividly conceived as to approach a vision of reality. We feel all the while, however, that the solid suggested is not solidly there. The reason why one solid may seem more easily suggested than another, and why it is easier in generally to perceive the diagram, solid than flat, seems due to probability. [110] Those lines have countless times in our past experience been drawn on our retina by solids for once that we have seen them flat on paper. And hundreds of times we have looked down upon the upper surface of parallelopipeds, stairs and glasses, for once that we have looked upwards at their bottom -- hence we see the solids easiest as if from above.\n\nHabit or probability seems also to govern the illusion of the intaglio profile, and of the hollow mask. We have never seen a human face except in relief -- hence the case with which the present sensation is overpowered. Hence, too, the obstinacy with which human faces and forms, and other extremely familiar convex objects, refuse to appear hollow when viewed through Wheatstone's pseudoscope. Our perception seems wedded to certain total ways of seeing certain objects. The moment the object is suggested at all, it takes possession of the mind in the fulness of its stereotyped habitual form. This explains the suddenness of the transformations when the perceptions change. The object shoots back and forth completely from this to that familiar thing, and doubtful, indeterminate, and composite things are excluded, apparently because we are unused to their existence.\n\nWhen we turn from the diagrams to the actual folded visiting-card and to the real glass, the imagined form seems fully as real as the correct one. The card flaps over; tile glass rim tilts this may or that, as if some inward spring suddenly became released in our eye. In these changes the actual retinal image receives different comments from the mind. But the remarkable thing is that the complement and the image combine so completely that the twain are one flesh, as it were, and cannot be discriminated in the result. If the complement be, as we have called it (on pp. 237-8), a set of imaginary absent eye-sensations, they seem no whit less vividly there than the sensation which the eye now receives from without.\n\nThe case of the after-images distorted by projection upon an oblique plane is even more strange, for the imagined perspective figure, lying in the plane, seems less to combine with the one a moment previously seen by the eye than to suppress it and take its place. [111] The point needing explanation, then, in all this, is how it comes to pass that, when imagined sensations are usually so inferior in vivacity to reel ones, they should in these few experiences prove to be almost or quite their match.\n\nThe mystery is solved when we note the class to which all these experiences belong. They are 'perceptions' of definite 'things,' definitely situated in tridimensional space. The mind uniformly uses its sensations to identify things by. The sensation is invariably apperceived by the idea, name, or 'normal' aspect (p. 238) of the thing. The peculiarity of the optical signs of things is their extraordinary mutability. A 'thing' which we follow with the eye, never doubting of its physical identity, will change its retinal image incessantly. A cross, a ring, waved about in the air, will pass through every conceivable angular and elliptical form. All the while, however, as we look at them, we hold fast to the perception of their 'real' shape, by mentally combining the pictures momentarily received with the notion of peculiar positions in space. It is not the cross and ring pure and simple which we perceive, but the cross so held, the ring so held. From the day of our birth we have sought every hour of our lives to correct the apparent form of things, and trans- it into the real form by keeping note of the way they are placed or held. In no other class of sensations does this incessant correction occur. What wonder, then, that the notion 'so placed' should invincibly exert its habitual corrective effect, even when the object with which it combines is only an after-image, and make us perceive the latter under a changed but more 'real' form? The 'real' form is also a sensation conjured up by memory; but it is one so probable, so habitually conjured up when we have just this combination of optical experiences, that it partakes of the invincible freshness of reality, and seems to break through that law which elsewhere condemns reproductive processes to being so much fainter than sensations.\n\nOnce more, these cases form an extreme. Somewhere, in the list of our imaginations of absent feelings, there must be found the vividest of all. These optical reproductions of real forms are the vividest of all. It is foolish to reason from cases lower in the scale, to prove that the scale can contain no such extreme cases as these; and particularly foolish since we can definitely see why these imaginations ought to be more vivid than any others, whenever they recall the forms of habitual and probable things. These latter, by incessantly repeated presence and reproduction, will plough deep grooves in the nervous system. There will be developed, to correspond to them, paths of least resistance, of unstable equilibrium, liable to become active in their totality when any point is touched off. Even when the objective stimulus is imperfect, we shall still see the full convexity of a human face, the correct inclination of an angle or sweep of a curve, or the distance of two lines. Our mind will be like a polyhedron, whose facets are the attitudes of perception in which it can most easily rest. These are worn upon it by habitual objects, and from one of these it can pass only by tumbling over into another. [112]\n\nHering has well accounted for the sensationally vivid character of these habitually reproduced forms. He says, after reminding us that every visual sensation is correlated to a physical process in the nervous apparatus: \"If this psychophysical process is aroused, as usually happens, by light-rays impinging on the retina, its form depends not only on the nature of these rays, but on the constitution of the entire nervous apparatus which is connected with the organ of vision, and on the state in which it finds itself. The same stimulus may excite widely different sensations according to this state.\n\n\"The constitution of the nervous apparatus depends naturally in part upon innate predisposition; but the ensemble of effects wrought by stimuli upon it in the course of life, whether these come through the eyes or from elsewhere, is a co-factor of its development. To express it otherwise, involuntary and voluntary experience and exercise assist in determining the material structure of the nervous organ of vision, and hence the ways in which it may react on a retinal image as an outward stimulus. That experience and exercise should be possible at all in vision is a consequence of the reproductive power, or memory, of its nerve-substance. Every particular activity of the organ makes it more suited to a repetition of the same; ever slighter touches are required to make the repetition occur. The organ habituates itself to the repeated activity....\n\n\"Suppose now that, in the first experience of a complex sensation produced by a particular retinal image, certain portions were made the special objects of attention. In a repetition of the sensible experience it will happen that notwithstanding the identity of the outward stimulus these portions will be more easily and strongly reproduced; and when this happens a hundred times the inequality with which the various constituents of the complex sensation appeal to consciousness grows ever greater.\n\n\"Now in the present state of our knowledge we cannot assert that in both the first and the last occurrence of the retinal image in question the same pure sensation is provoked, but that the mind interprets it differently the last time in consequence of experience; for the only open thing we know are on the one hand the retinal image which is both times the same, and on the other the mental percept which is both times different ; of a third thing, such as a pure sensation, interpolated between image and percept, we know nothing. We ought, therefore, if we wish to avoid hypotheses, simply to say that the nervous apparatus reacts the last time differently from the first, and gives us in consequence it different group of sensations.\n\n\"But not only by repetition of the same retinal image, but by that of similar ones, will the law obtain. Portions of the image common to the successive experiences will awaken, as it were, a stronger echo in the nervous apparatus than other portions. Hence it results that reproduction is usually elective: the more strongly reverberating parts of the picture yield stronger feelings than the rest. This may result in the latter being quite overlooked and, as it were, eliminated from perception. It may even come to pass that instead of these parts eliminated by election a feeling of entirely different elements comes to consciousness -- elements not objectively contained in the stimulus. A group of sensations, namely, for which a strong tendency to reproduction has become, by frequent repetition, ingrained in the nervous system will easily revive as a whole when, not its whole retinal image, but only an essential part thereof, returns. In this case we get some sensations to which no adequate stimulus exists in the retinal image, and which owe their being solely to the reproductive power of the nervous apparatus. This is complementary (erg\u00e4nzende) reproduction.\n\n\"Thus a few points and disconnected strokes are sufficient to make us see a human face, and without specially directed attention we fail to note that we see much that really is not drawn on the paper. Attention will show that the outlines were deficient in spots where we thought them complete.... The portions of the percept supplied by complementary reproduction depend, however, just as much as its other portions, on the reaction of the nervous apparatus upon the retinal image, indirect though this reaction may, in the case of the supplied portions, be. And so long as they are present, we have a perfect right to call them sensations, for they differ in no wise from such sensations as correspond to an actual stimulus in the retina. Often, however, they are not persistent; many of them may be expelled by more close observation, but this is not proved to be the case with all.... In vision with one eye... the distribution of parts within the third dimension is essentially the work of this complementary reproduction, i.e. of former experience.... When a certain way of localizing a particular group of sensations has become with us a second nature, our better knowledge, our judgment, our logic, are of no avail.... Things actually diverse may give similar or almost identical retinal images; e.g., an object extended in three dimensions, and its hat perspective picture. In such cases it often depends on small accidents, and especially on our will, whether the one or the other group of sensations shall be excited.... We can see a relief hollow, as a mould, or vice vers\u00e2; for a relief illuminated from the left can look just like its mould illuminated from the right. Reflecting upon this, one may infer from the direction of the shadows that one has a relief before one, and the idea of the relief will guide the nerve-processes into the right path, so that the feeling of the relief is suddenly aroused.... Whenever the retinal image is of such a nature that two diverse modes of reaction on the part of the nervous apparatus are, so to speak, equally, or nearly equally, imminent, it must depend on small accidents whether the one or the other reaction is realized. In these cases our previous knowledge often has a decisive effect, and helps the correct perception to victory. The bare idea of the right object is itself a feeble reproduction which with the help of the proper retinal picture develops into clear and lively sensation. But if there be not already in the nervous apparatus a disposi- tion to the production of that percept which our judgment tells us is right, our knowledge strives in vain to conjure up the feeling of it; we then know that we see something to which no reality corresponds, but we see it all the same. [113]\n\nNote that no object not probable, no object which we are not incessantly practised in reproducing, can acquire this vividness in imagination. Objective corners are ever changing their angles to the eyes, spaces their apparent size, lines their distance. But by no transmutation of position in space does an objective straight line appear bent, and only in one position out of an infinity does a broken line look straight. Accordingly, it is impossible by projecting the after-image\n\nof a straight line upon two surfaces which make a. solid angle with each other to give the line itself a sensible 'kink.' Look with it at the corner of your room: the after-image, which may overlap all three surfaces of the corner, still continues straight. Volkmann constructed a complicated surface of projection like that drawn in Fig. 77, but he found it impossible so to throw a straight after- image upon it as to alter its visible form.\n\nOne of the situations in which we oftenest see things is spread out on the ground before us. We are incessantly drilled in making allowance for this perspective, and reducing things to their real form in spite of optical foreshortening. Hence if the preceding explanations are true, we ought to find this habit inveterate. The lower half of the retina, which habitually sees the farther half of things spread out on the ground, ought to have acquired a habit of enlarging its pictures by imagination, so as to make them more than equal to those which fall on the upper retinal surface; and this habit ought to be hard to escape from, even when both halves of the object are equidistant from the eye, as in a, vertical line on paper. Delboeuf has found, accordingly, that if we try to bisect such a line we place the point of division about 1/16 of its length too high. [114]\n\nSimilarly, a square cross, or a square, drawn on paper, should look higher than it is broad. And that this is actually the case, the reader may verify by a glance at Fig 78.\n\nFor analogous reasons the upper and lower halves of the letter S, or of the figure 8, hardly seem to differ. But when turned upside down, as [upside-down \"S\" and \"8\"] the upper half looks much the larger. [115]\n\nHering has tried to explain our exaggeration of small angles in the same way. We have more to do with right angles than with any others: right angles, in fact, have an altogether unique sort of interest for the human mind. Nature almost never begets them, but we think space by means of them and put them everywhere. Consequently obtuse and acute ones, liable always to be the images of right ones foreshortened, particularly easily revive right ones in memory. It is hard to look at such figures as a, b, c, in Fig. 79, without seeing them in perspective, as\n\napproximations, at least, to foreshortened rectangular forms. [116]\n\nAt the same time the genuine sensational form of the lines before us can, in all the cases of distortion by suggested perspective, be felt correctly by a mind able to abstract from the notion of perspective altogether. Individuals differ in this abstracting power. Artistic training improves it, so that after a little while errors in vertical bi-section, in estimating height relatively to breadth, etc., become impossible. In other words, we learn to take the optical sensation before us pure. [117]\n\nWe may then sum up our study of illusions by saying that they in no wise undermine our view that every spatial determination of things is originally given in the shape of a sensation of the eyes. They only show how very potent certain imagined sensations of the eyes may become.\n\nThese sensations, so far as they bring definite forms to the mind, appear to be retinal exclusively. The movements of the eyeballs play a great part in educating our perception, it is true; but they have nothing to do with constituting any one feeling of form. Their function is limited to exciting the various feelings of form, by tracing retinal streaks; and to comparing them, and measuring them off against each other, by applying different parts of the retinal surface to the same objective thing. Helmholtz's analysis of the facts of our 'measurement of the field of view' is, bating a lapse or two, masterly, and seems to prove that the movements of the eye have had some part in bringing our sense of retinal equivalencies about -- equivalencies, mind, of different retinal forms and sizes, not forms and sizes themselves. Superposition is the way in which the eye-movements accomplish this result. An object traces the line AB on a peripheral tract of the retina. Quickly we move the eye so that the same object traces the line ab on a central tract. Forthwith, to our mind, AB and ab are judged equivalent. But, as Helmholtz admits, the equivalence-judgment is independent of the way in which we may feel the form and length of the several retinal pictures themselves:\n\n\"The retina is like a pair of compasses, whose points we apply in succession to the ends of several lines to see whether they agree or not in length. All we need know meanwhile about the compasses is that the distance of their points remains unchanged. What that distance is, and what is the shape of the compasses, is a matter of no account.\" [118]\n\nMeasurement implies a stuff to measure. Retinal sensations give the stuff; objective things form the yard-stick; motion does the measuring operation; which can, of course, be well performed only where it is possible to make the same object fall on many retinal tracts. This is practically im possible where the tracts make a wide angle with each other. But there are certain directions in the held of view, certain retinal lines, along which it is particularly easy to make the image of an object slide. The object then be- comes 'ruler' for these lines, as Helmholtz; puts it, [119] making them seem straight throughout if the object looked straight to us in that pert of them at which it was most distinctly seen.\n\nBut all this need of superposition shows how devoid of exact space-import the feelings of movement are per se. As we compare the space-value of two retinal tracts by super- posing them successively upon the same objective line, so we also hare to compare the space-value of objective angles and lines by superposing them on the same retinal tract. Neither procedure would be required if our eye-movements were apprehended immediately, by pure muscular feeling or innervation, for example, as distinct lengths and directions in space. To compare retinal tracts, it would then suffice simply to notice how it feels to move any image over them. And two objective lines could be compared as well by moving different retinal tracts along them as by laying them along the same. It would be as easy to com- pare non-parallel figures as it now is to judge of those which are parallel. [120] Those which it took the same amount of movement to traverse would be equal, in whatever direction the movement occurred.\n\nGENERAL SUMMARY.\n\nWith this we may end our long and, I fear to many readers, tediously minute survey. The facts of vision form a jungle of intricacy; and those who penetrate deeply into physiological optics will be more struck by our omissions than by our abundance of detail. But for students who may have lost sight of the forest for the trees, I will recapitulate briefly the points of our whole argument from the beginning, and then proceed to a short historical survey, which will set them in relief.\n\nAll our sensations are positively and inexplicably extensive wholes.\n\nThe sensations contributing to space-perception seem exclusively to be the surface of skin, retina, and joints. 'Muscular' feelings play no appreciable part in the generation of our feelings of form, direction, etc.\n\nThe total bigness of a cutaneous or retinal feeling soon becomes subdivided by discriminative attention.\n\nMovements assist this discrimination by reason of the peculiarly exciting quality of the sensations which stimuli moving over surfaces arouse.\n\nSubdivisions, once discriminated, acquire definite relations of position towards each other within the total space. These 'relations' are themselves feelings of the subdivisions that intervene. When these subdivisions are not the seat of stimuli, the relations are only reproduced in imaginary form.\n\nThe various sense-spaces are, in the first instance, incoherent with each other; and primitively both they and their subdivisions are but vaguely comparable in point of bulk and form.\n\nThe education of our space-perception consists largely of two processes -- reducing the various sense-feelings to a common measure, and adding them together into the single all-including space of the real world.\n\nBoth the measuring and the adding are performed by the aid of things.\n\nThe imagined aggregate of positions occupied by all the actual or possible, moving or stationary, things which we know, is our notion of 'real' space -- a very incomplete and vague conception in all minds.\n\nThe measuring of our space-feelings against each other mainly comes about through the successive arousal of different ones by the same thing, by our selection of certain ones as feelings of its real size and shape, and by the degradation of others to the status of being merely signs of these.\n\nFor the successive application of the same thing to different space-giving surfaces motion is indispensable, and hence plays a great pert in our space-education, especially in that of the eye. Abstractly considered, the motion of the object over the sensitive surface would educate us quite as well as that of the surface over the object. But the self- mobility of the organ carrying the surface accelerates immensely the result.\n\nIn completely educated space-perception, the present sensation is usually just what Helmholtz (Physiol. Optik, p. 797) calls it, 'a sign, the interpretation of whose meaning is left to the understanding'. But the understanding is exclusively reproductive and never productive in the process; and its function is limited to the recall of previous space-sensations with which the present one has been associated and which may be judged more real than it.\n\nFinally, this reproduction may in the case of certain visual forms be as vivid, or almost so, as actual sensation is.\n\nThe third dimension forms an original element of all our space-sensations. In the eye it is subdivided by various discriminations. The more distant subdivisions are often shut out altogether, and, in being suppressed, have the effort of diminishing the absolute space-value of the total field of view. [121]\n\nHISTORICAL\n\nLet us now close with a brief historical survey. The first achievement of note in the study of space-perception was Berkeley's theory of vision. This undertook to establish two points, first that distance was not a visual but a tactile form of consciousness, suggested by visual signs; secondly, that there is no one quality or 'idea' common to the sensations of touch and sight, such that prior to experience one might possibly anticipate from the look of an object anything about its felt size, shape, or position, or from the touch of it anything about its look.\n\nIn other words, that primitively chaotic or semi-chaotic condition of our various sense-spaces which we have demonstrated, was established for good by Berkeley; and he bequeathed to psychology the problem of describing the manner in which the deliverances are harmonized so as all to refer to one and the same extended world.\n\nHis disciples in Great Britain have solved this problem after Berkeley's own fashion, and to a great extent as we have done ourselves, by the ideas of the various senses suggesting each other in consequence of Association. But, either because they were intoxicated with the principle of association, or because in the number of details they lost their general bearings, they have forgotten, as a rule, to state under what sensible form the primitive spatial experiences are found which later became associated with so many other sensible signs. Heedless of their master Locke's precept, that the mind can frame unto itself no one new simple idea, they seem for the most part to be trying to explain the extensive plurality itself, account for it, and evolve it, by the mere association together of feelings which originally possessed it not. They first evaporate the nature of extension by making it tantamount to mere 'coexistence,' and then they explain coexistence as being the same thing as succession, provided it be an extremely rapid or a reversible succession. Space-perception thus emerges without being anywhere postulated. The only things postulated are unextended feelings and time. Says Thomas Brown (lecture XXIII.): \"I am inclined to reverse exactly the process commonly supposed ; and instead of deriving the measure of time from extension, to derive the knowledge and original measure of extension from time.\" Brown and both the Mills think that retinal sensations, colors, in their primitive condition, are felt with no extension and that the latter merely becomes inseparably associated with them. John Mill says: \"Whatever may be the retinal impression conveyed by a line which bounds two colors, I see no ground for thinking that by the eye alone we could acquire the conception of what we now mean when we say that one of the colors is outside [beside][122] the other.\" [123]\n\nWhence does the extension come which gets so inseparably associated with these non-extended colored sensations? From the 'sweep and movements' of the eye -- from muscular feelings. But, as Prof. Bain says, if movement-feelings give us any property of things, \"it would seem to be not space, but time.\" [124] And John Min says that \"the idea of space is, at bottom, one of time.\" [125] Space, then, is not to be found in any elementary sensation, but, in Bain's words, \"as a quality, it has no other origin and no other meaning then the association of these different [non-spatial] [126] motor and sensitive effects.\" [127]\n\nThis phrase is mystical-sounding enough to one who understands association as producing nothing, but only as knitting together things already produced in separate ways. The truth is that the English Associationist school, in trying to show how much their principle can accomplish, have altogether overshot the mark and espoused a kind of theory in respect to space-perception which the general tenor of their philosophy should lead them to abhor. Really there are but three possible kinds of theory concerning space. Either (1) there is no spatial quality of sensation at all, and space is a mere symbol of succession; or (2) there is an extensive quality given immediately in certain particular sensations ; or, finally, (3) there is a quality produced out of the inward resources of the mind, to envelop sensations which, as given originally, are not spatial, but which, on being cast into the spatial form, become united and orderly. This last is the Kantian view. Stumpf admirably designates it as the 'psychic stimulus' theory, the crude sensations being considered as goads to the mind to put forth its slumbering power.\n\nBrown, the Mills, and Bain, amid these possibilities, seem to have gone astray like lost sheep. With the 'mental chemistry' of which the Mills speak -- precisely the same thing as the 'psychical synthesis' of Wundt, which, as we shall soon see, is a principle expressly intended to do what Association can never perform -- they hold the third view, but again in other places imply the first. And, between the impossibility of getting from mere association anything not contained in the sensations associated and the dislike to allow spontaneous mental productivity, they flounder in a dismal dilemma. Mr. Sully joins them there in what I must call a vague and vacillating way. Mr. Spencer of course is bound to pretend to 'evolve' all mental qualities out of antecedents different from themselves, so that we need perhaps not wonder at his refusal to accord the spatial quality to any of the several elementary sensations out of which our space-perception grows. Thus (Psychology, ii. 168, 172, 218):\n\n\"No idea of extension can arise from a simultaneous excitation\" of a multitude of nerve-terminations like those of the skin or the retina, since this would imply a \"knowledge of their relative positions\" -- that is, \"a pre-existent idea of a special extension, which is absurd.\" \"No relation between successive states of consciousness gives in itself any idea of extension.\" \"The muscular sensations accompanying motion are quite distinct from the notions of space and time associated with them.''\n\nMr. Spencer none the less inveighs vociferously against the Kantian position that space is produced by the mind's own resources. And yet he nowhere denies space to be a, specific affection of consciousness different from time!\n\nSuch incoherency is pitiful. The fact is that, at bottom, all these authors are really 'psychical stimulists,' or Kantists. The space they speak of is a super-sensational mental product. This position appears to me thoroughly mythological. But let us see how it is held by those who know more definitely what they mean. Schopenhauer expresses the Kantian view with more vigor and clearness than anyone else. He says:\n\n\"A man must be forsaken by all the gods to dream that the world we see outside of us, fining space in its three dimensions, moving down the inexorable stream of time, governed at each step by Causality's invariable law, -- but in all this only following rules which we may prescribe for it in advance of all experience, -- to dream, I say, that such a world should stand there outside of us, quite objectively real with no complicity of ours, and thereupon by a subsequent act, through the instrumentality of mere sensation, that it should enter our head and reconstruct a duplicate of itself as it was outside. For what a poverty-stricken thing is this mere sensation ! Even in the noblest organs of sense it is nothing more than a local and specific feeling, susceptible within its kind of a few variations, but always strictly subjective and containing in itself nothing objective, nothing resembling a perception. For sensation of every sort is and remains a process in the organism itself. As such it is limited to the territory inside the skin and can never, accordingly, per se contain anything that lies outside the skin or outside ourselves.... Only when the Understanding...is roused to activity and brings its sole and only form, the law of Causality, into play, only then does the mighty transformation take place which makes out of subjective sensation objective intuition. The Understanding, namely, grasps by means of its innate, a priori, ante-experiential form, the given sensation of the body as an effect which as such must necessarily have a cause. At the same time the Understanding summons to Its aid the form of the outer sense which similarly lies already preformed in the intellect (or brain), and which is Space, in order to locate that cause outside of the organism.... In this process the Understanding, as I shall soon show, takes note of the most minute peculiarities of the given sensation in order to construct in the outer space a cause which shall completely account for them. This operation of the Understanding is, however, not one that takes place discursively, reflectively, in abstracto, by means of words and concepts; but is intuitive and immediate.... Thus the Understanding must drat create the objective world; never can the latter, already complete in se, simply promenade into our heads through the senses and organic apertures. For the senses yield us nothing further than the raw material which must be first elaborated into the objective conception of an orderly physical world-system by means of the aforesaid simple forms of Space, Time, and Causality.... Let me show the great chasm between sensation and perception by showing how raw the material is out of which the fair structure is upreared [sic]. Only two senses serve objective perception: touch and sight. They alone furnish the data on the basis whereof the Understanding, by the process indicated, erects the objective world.... These data in themselves are still no perception ; that is the Understanding's work. If I press with my hand against the table, the sensation I receive has no analogy with the idea of the firm cohesion of the parts of this mass: only when my Understanding passes from the sensation to its cause does it create for itself a body with the properties of solidity, impenetrability, and hardness. When in the dark I lay my hand on a surface, or grasp a ball of three inches diameter, in either case the same parts of the band receive the impression: but out of the different contraction of the hand in the two cases my Understanding constructs the form of the body whose contact caused the feeling, and confirms its construction by leading me to move my hand over the body. If one born blind handles a cubical body, the sensations of his hand are quite uniform on all sides and in all directions, -- only the corners press upon a smaller part of his skin. In these sensations, as such, there is nothing whatever analogous to a cube. But from the felt resistance his Understanding infers immediately and intuitively a cause thereof, which now presents itself as a solid body; and from the movements of exploration which the arms made whilst the feelings of the hands remained constant he constructs, in the space known to him a priori, the body's cubical shape. Did he not bring with him ready-made the idea of a cause and of a space, with the laws thereof, there never could arise, out. of those successive feelings in his hand, the image of a cube. If we let a string run through our closed hand, we immediately construct as the cause of the friction and its duration in such an attitude of the hand, a long cylindrical body moving uniformly in one direction. But never out of the pure sensation in the hand could the idea of movement, that is, of change of position in space by means of time, arise: such a content can never lie in sensation, nor come out of it. Our Intellect, antecedently to all experience, must bear in itself the intuitions of Space and Time, and therewithal of the possibility of motion, and no less the idea of Causality, to pass from the empirically given feeling to its cause, and to construct the latter as a so moving body of the designated shape. For how great is the abyss between the mere sensation in the hand and the ideas of causality, materiality, and movement through Space, occurring in Time! The feeling in the hand, even with different contacts and positions, is something far too uniform and poor in content for it to be possible to construct out of it the idea of Space with its three dimensions, of the action of bodies on each other, with the properties of extension, impenetrability, cohesion, shape, hardness, softness, rest, and motion -- in short, the foundations of the objective world. This is only possible through Space, Time, and Causality...being preformed in the Intellect itself,... from whence it again follows that the perception of the external world is essentially an intellectual process, a work of the Understanding, to which sensation furnishes merely the occasion, and the data to be interpreted in each particular case.\" [128]\n\nI call this view mythological, because I am conscious of no such Kantian machine-shop in my mind, and feel no call to disparage the powers of poor sensation in this merciless way. I have no introspective experience of mentally producing or creating space. My space-intuitions occur not in two times but in one. There is not one moment of passive inextensive sensation, succeeded by another of active extensive perception, but the form I see is as immediately felt as the color which fins it out. That the higher parts of the mind come in, who can deny ? They add and subtract, they compare and measure, they reproduce and abstract. They inweave the space-sensations with intellectual relations; but these relations are the same when they obtain between the elements of the space-system as when they obtain between any of the other elements of which the world is made.\n\nThe essence of the Kantian contention is that there are not spaces, but Space -- one infinite continuous Unit -- and that our knowledge of this cannot be a piecemeal sensational affair, produced by summation and abstraction. To which the obvious reply is that, if any known thing bears on its front the appearance of piecemeal construction and abstraction, it is this very notion of the infinite unitary space of the world. It is a notion, if ever there was one; and no intuition. Most of us apprehend it in the barest symbolic abridgment: and if perchance we ever do try to make it more adequate, we just add one image of sensible extension to another until we are tired. Most of us are obliged to turn round and drop the thought of the space in front of us when we think of that behind. And the space represented as near to us seems more minutely subdivisible than that we think of as lying far away.\n\nThe other prominent German writers on space are also 'psychical stimulists.' Herbert, whose influence has been widest, says 'the resting eye sees no space,' [129] and ascribes visual extension to the influence of movements combining with the non-spatial retinal feelings so as to form graduated series of the latter. A given sensation of such a series reproduces the idea of its associates in regular order, and its idea is similarly reproduced by any one of them with the order reversed. Out of the fusion of these two contrasted reproductions comes the form of space [130] -- Heaven knows how.\n\nThe obvious objection is that mere serial order is a genus, and space-order a very peculiar species of that genus; and that, if the terms of reversible series became by that fact coexistent terms in space, the musical scale, the degrees of warmth and cold, and all other ideally graded series ought to appear to us in the shape of extended corporeal aggregates, -- which they notoriously do not, though we may of course symbolize their order by a spatial scheme. W. Volkmann von Volkmar, the Herbartian, takes the bull here by the horns, and says the musical scale is spatially extended, though he admits that its space does not belong to the real world. [131] I am unacquainted with any other Herbartian so bold.\n\nTo Lotze we owe the much-used term 'local sign.' He insisted that space could not emigrate directly into the mind from without, but must be reconstructed by the soul; and he seemed to think that the first reconstructions of it by the soul must be super-sensational, But why sensations themselves might not be the soul's original spatial reconstructive acts Lotze fails to explain.\n\nWundt has all his life devoted himself to the elaboration of a space-theory, of which the neatest and most final expression is to be found in his Logik (ii. 457-60). He says:\n\n\"In the eye, space-perception has certain constant peculiarities which prove that no single optical sensation by itself possesses the extensive form, but that everywhere in our perception of space heterogene- ous feelings combine. If we simply suppose that luminous sensations per se feel extensive, our supposition is shattered by that influence of movement in vision which is so clearly to be traced in many normal errors in the measurement, of the field of view. If we assume, on the other hand, that the movements and their feelings are alone possessed of the extensive quality, we make an unjustified hypothesis, for the phenomena compel us, it is true, to accord an influence to movement, but give us no right, to call the retinal sensations indifferent, for there are no visual ideas without retinal sensations. If then we wish rigorously to express the given facts, we can ascribe a spatial constitution only to combinations of retinal sensations with those of movement.\"\n\nThus Wundt, dividing theories into 'nativistic' and 'genetic,' calls his own a genetic theory. To distinguish it from other theories of the same class, he names it a 'theory of complex local signs.\"\n\n\"It supposes two systems of local signs, whose relations -- taking the eye as an example -- we may think as... the measuring of the manifold local-sign system of the retina by the simple local-sign system of the movements. In its psychological nature this is a process of associative synthesis: it consists in the fusion of both groups of sensations into a product, whose elementary components are no longer separable from each other in idea. In melting wholly away into the product which they create they become consciously undistinguishable, and the mind apprehends only their resultant, the intuition of space. Thus there obtains a certain analogy between this psychic synthesis and that chemical synthesis which out of simple bodies generates a compound that appears to our immediate perception as a homogeneous whole with new properties.''\n\nNow let no modest reader think that if this sounds obscure to him it is because he does not know the full context; and that if a, wise professor like Wundt can talk so fluently and plausibly about 'combination' and 'psychic synthesis,' it must surely be because those words convey a so much greater fulness of positive meaning to the scholarly than to the unlearned mind. Really it is quite the reverse; all the virtue of the phrase lies in its mere sound and skin. Learning does but make one the more sensible of its inward unintelligibility. Wundt's 'theory' is the flimsiest thing in the world. It starts by an untrue assumption, and then corrects it by an unmeaning phrase. Retinal sensations are spatial; and were they not, no amount of 'synthesis' with equally spaceless motor sensations could intelligibly make them so. Wundt's theory is, in short, but an avowal of impotence, and an appeal to the inscrutable powers of the soul. [132] It confesses that we cannot analyse the constitution or give the genesis of the spatial quality in consciousness. But at the same time it says the antecedents thereof are psychical and not cerebral facts. In calling the quality in question a sensational quality, our own account equally disclaimed ability to analyse it, but said its antecedents were cerebral, not psychical -- in other words, that it was a first psychical thing. This is merely a question of probable fact, which the reader may decide.\n\nAnd now what shall be said of Helmholtz? Can I find fault with a book which, on the whole, I imagine to be one of the four or five greatest monuments of human genius in the scientific line? If truth impels I must fain try, and take the risks. It seems to me that Helmholtz's genius moves most securely when it keeps close to particular facts. At any rate, it shows least strong in purely speculative passages, which in the Optics, in spite of many beauties, seem to me fundamentally vacillating and obscure. The 'empiristic' view which Helmholtz defends is that the space-determinations we perceive are in every case products of a process of unconscious inference. [133] The inference is similar to one from induction or analogy. [134] We always see that form before us which habitually would have caused the sensation we now have. [135] But the latter sensation can never be intrinsically spatial, or its intrinsic space-determinations would never be overcome as they are so often by the 'illusory' space-determinations it so often suggests. [136] Since the illusory determination can be traced to a suggestion of Experience, the 'real' one must also be such a suggestion: so that all space intuitions are due sole- ly to Experience. [137] The only psychic activity required for this is the association of ideas. [138]\n\nBut how, it may be asked, can association produce a. space-quality not in the things associated? How can we by induction or analogy infer what we do not already generically know ? Can 'suggestions of experience' reproduce elements which no particular experience originally contained? This is the point by which Helmholtz's 'empiristic' theory, as a theory, must he judged. No theory is worthy of the name which leaves such a point obscure.\n\nWell, Helmholtz does so leave it. At one time he seems to fall back on inscrutable powers of the soul, and to range himself with the 'psychical stimulists.' He speaks of gent as having made the essential step in the matter in distinguishing the content of experience from that form -- space, course -- which is given it by the peculiar faculties of the mind. [139] But elsewhere, again, [140] speaking of sensationalistic theories which would connect spatially determinate feelings directly with certain neural events, he says it is better to assume only such simple psychic activities as we know to exist, and gives the association of ideas as an instance of what he means. Later, [141] he reinforces this remark by confessing that he does not see how any neural process can give rise without antecedent experience to a ready-made (fertige) perception of space. And, finally, in a single momentous sentence, he speaks of sensations of touch as if they might be the original material of our space-percepts -- which thus, from the optical point of view, 'may be assumed as given.' [142]\n\nOf course the eye-man has a right to fall back on the skin-man for help at a pinch. But doesn't this means that he is a mere eye-man and not a complete psychologist ? In other words, Helmholtz's Optics and the 'empiristic theory' there professed are not to be understood as attempts at answering the general question of how space-consciousness enters the mind. They simply deny that it enters with the first optical sensations. [143] Our own account has affirmed stoutly that it enters then; but no more than Helmholtz have we pretended to show why. Who calls a thing a first sensation admits he has no theory of its production. Helmholtz, though all the while without an articulate theory, makes the world thing he has one. He beautifully traces the immense part which reproductive processes play in our vision of space, and never -- except in that one pitiful little sentence about touch -- does he tell us just what it is they reproduce. He limits himself to denying that they reproduce originals of a visual sort. And so difficult is the subject, and so magically do catch-words work on the popular-scientist ear, that most likely, had he written 'physiological' instead of 'nativistic,' and 'spiritualistic' instead of 'empiristic' (which synonyms Hering suggests), numbers of his present empirical evolutionary followers would fail to find in his teaching anything worthy of praise. But since he wrote otherwise, they hurrah for him as a sort of second Locke, dealing another death-blow at the old bugaboo of 'innate ideas.' His 'nativistic' adversary Hering, they probably imagine, -- Heaven save the mark ! -- to be a scholastic in modern disguise.\n\nAfter Wundt and Helmholtz, the most important anti-sensationalist space-philosopher in Germany is Professor Lipps, whose deduction of space from an order of non-spatial differences, continuous yet separate, is a wonderful piece of subtlety and logic. And yet he has to confess that continuous differences form in the first instance only a logical series, which need not appear spatial, and that whenever it does so appear, this must be accounted a 'fact,' due merely 'to the nature of the soul.' [144]\n\nLipps, and almost all the anti-sensationalist theorists except Helmholtz, seem guilty of that confusion which Mr. Shadworth Hodgson has done so much to clear away, viz., the confounding the analysis of an idea with the means of its production. Lipps, for example, finds that every space we think of can be broken up into positions, and concludes that in some undefined way the several positions must have pre-existed in thought before the aggregate space could have appeared to perception. Similarly Mr. Spencer, defining extension as an 'aggregate of relations of coexistent position,' says \"every cognition of magnitude is a cognition of relations of position,\" [145] and \"no idea of extension can arise from the simultaneous excitation\" of many nerves \"unless there is a knowledge of their relative positions.\" [146] Just so Prof. Bain insists that the very meaning of space is scope for movement, [147] and that therefore distance and magnitude can be no original attributes of the eye's sensibility. Similarly because movement is analyzable into positions occupied at successive moments by the mover, philosophers (e.g. Schopenhauer, as quoted above) have repeatedly denied the possibility of its being an immediate sensation. We have, however, seen that it is the most immediate of all our space-sensations. Because it can only occur in a definite direction the impossibility of perceiving it without perceiving its direction has been decreed -- a decree which the simplest experiment overthrows. [148] It is a case of what I have called the 'psychologist's fallacy': mere acquaintance with space is treated as tantamount to every sort of knowledge about it, the conditions of the latter are demanded of the former state of mind, and all sorts of mythological processes are brought in to help. [149] As well might one say that because the world consists of all its parts, there- fore we can only apprehend it at all by having unconsciously summed these up in our head. It is the old idea of our actual knowledge being drawn out from a pre-existent potentiality, an idea which, whatever worth it may metaphysically possess, does no good in psychology.\n\nMy own sensationalistic account has derived most aid and comfort from the writings of Hering, A. W. Volkmann, Stumpf, Leconte, and Sch\u00f6n. All these authors allow ample scope to that Experience which Berkeley's genius saw to be a present factor in all our visual acts. But they give Experience some grist to grind, which the soi-distant 'empiristic' school forgets to do. Stumpf seems to me the most philosophical and profound of all these writers; and I owe him much. I should doubtless have owed almost as much to Mr. James Ward, had his article on Psychology in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica appeared before my own thoughts were written down. The literature of the question is in all languages very voluminous. I content myself with referring to the bibliography in Helmholtz's and Aubert's works on Physiological Optics for the visual part of the subject, and with naming in a note the ablest works in the English tongue which have treated of the subject in a general way. [150]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] Reprinted, with considerable revision, from 'Mind' for 1887.\n\n[2] Prof. Jastrow has found that invariably we tend to underestimate the amount of our skin which may be stimulated by contact with an object when we express it in terms of visual space; that is, when asked to mark on paper the extent of skin affected, we always draw it much too small. This shows that the eye gets as much space-feeling from the smaller line as the skin gets from the larger one. Cf. Jastrow: Mind, xi. 546-7; American Journal of Psychology, iii. 53.\n\n[3] Amongst sounds the graver ones seem the most extensive. Stumpf gives three reasons for this: 1) association with bigger causes; 2) wider reverberation of the hand and body when grave notes are sung; 3) audibility at a greater distance. He thinks that these three reasons dispense us from supposing an immanent extensity in the sensation of sound as such.

III. c. vi. &\u00a7 2.\n\n[10] Fechner, who was ignorant of the but lately discovered function of the semi-circular canals, gives a different explanation of the organic seat of these feelings. They are probably highly composite. With me, actual movements in the eyes play a considerable part in them, though I am hardly conscious of the peculiar feelings in the scalp which Fechner goes on to describe thus: \" The feeling of strained attention in the different sense-organs seems to be only a muscular one produced in using these various organs by setting in motion, by a sort of reflex action, the set of muscles which belong to them. One can ask, then, with what particular muscular contraction the sense of strained attention in the effort to recall something is associated? On this question my own feeling gives me a decided answer; it comes to me distinctly not as a sensation of tension in the inside of the head, but as a feeling of strain and contraction in the scalp, with a pressure from outwards in over the whole cranium, undoubtedly caused by a contraction of the muscles of the scalp. This harmonizes very well with the expressions, sich den Kopf zerbrechen, den Kopf zusammennehmen. In a former illness, when I could not endure the slightest effort after continuous thought, and had no theoretical bias on this question, the muscles of the scalp, especially those of the back-head, assumed a fairly morbid degree of sensibility whenever I tried to think.\" (Elem. der Psychophysik, ii 490-91.)\n\n[11] That the sensation in question is one of tactile rather than of acoustic sensibility would seem proved by the fact that a medical friend of the writer, both of whose membran\u00e6 tympani are quite normal, but one of whose ears is almost totally deaf, feels the presence and withdrawal of objects as well at one ear as at the other.\n\n[12] The skin seems to obey a different law from the eye here. If a given retinal tract be excited, first by a series of points, and next by the two extreme points, with the interval between them unexcited, this interval will seem considerably less in the second case than it seemed in the first. In the skin the unexcited interval feels the larger. The reader may easily verify the facts in this case by taking a visiting-card, cutting one edge of it into a saw-tooth pattern, and from the opposite edge cutting out all but the two corners, and then comparing the feelings aroused by the two edges when held against the skin.\n\n[13] Classen, Physiologie des Gesichtssinnes, p. 114 ; see also A. Riehl, Der Philosophische Kriticismus, ii. p. 149.\n\n[14] It is worth while at this point to call attention with some emphasis to the fact that, though the anatomical condition of the feeling resembles the feeling itself, such resemblance cannot be taken by our understanding to explain why the feeling should be just whet it is. We hear it untiringly reiterated by materialists and spiritualists alike that we can see no possible inward reason why a certain brain-process should produce the feeling of redness and another of anger: the one process is no more red than the other is angry, and the coupling of process and feeling is, as far as other understanding goes, a juxtaposition pure and simple. But in the matter of spatial feeling, where the retinal patch that produces a triangle in the mind is itself a, triangle, etc., it looks at first sight as if the sensation might be a direct cognition of its own neural condition. Were this true, however, our sensation should be one of multitude rather than of continuous extent; for the condition is number of optical nerve-termini, and even this is only a remote condition and not an immediate condition. The immediate condition of the feeling is not the process in the retina, but the process in the brain; and the process in the brain may, for aught we know, be as unlike a triangle, -- nay, it probably is so, -- as it is unlike redness or rage. It is simply a coincidence that in the case of space one of the organic conditions, viz., the triangle impressed on the skin or the retina, should lend to a representation in the mind of the subject observed similar to that which it produces in the psychological observer. In no other kind of case is the coincidence found. Even should we admit that we cognize triangles in space because of our immediate cognition of the triangular shape of our excited group of nerve-tips, the matter would hardly be more transparent, for the mystery would still remain, why are we so much better cognizant of triangles on our finger-tips than on the nerve-tips of our back, on our eye than on our ear, and on any of these parts than in our brain? Thos. Brown very rightly rejects the notion of explaining the shape of the space perceived by the shape of the 'nervous expansion affected.' \" If this alone were necessary, we should have square inches and half inches, and various other forms, rectilinear and curvilinear, of fragrance and sound.\" (Lectures, xxii.)\n\n[15] Musical tones, e.g., have an order of quality independent either of their space- or time-order. Music comes from the time-order of the notes upsetting their quality-order. In general, if a b c d e f g h i j k, etc., stand for an arrangement of feelings in the order of their quality, they may assume any space-order or time-order, as d e f a h g, etc., and still the order of quality will remain fixed and unchanged.\n\n[16] The whole science of geometry may be said to owe its being to the exorbitant interest which the human mind takes in lines. We cut space up in every direction in order to manufacture them.\n\n[17] Kant was, I believe, the first to call attention to this last order of facts. After pointing out that two opposite spherical triangles, two gloves of a pair, two spirals wound in contrary directions, have identical inward determinations, that is, have their parts defined with relation to each other by the same law, and so must be conceived as identical, he showed that the impossibility of their mutual superposition obliges us to assign to each figure of a symmetrical pair a peculiar difference of its own which can only consist in an outward determination or relation of its parts, no longer to each other, but to the whole of an objectively outlying space with its points of tire compass given absolutely. This inconceivable difference is perceived only \"through the relation to right and left, which is a matter of immediate intuition.\" In these last words (welches unmittelbar auf Anschauung geht -- Prolegomena. &\u00a7 12) Kant expresses all that we have meant by speaking Of up and down, right and left, as sensations. He is wrong, however, in invoking relation to extrinsic total space as essential to the existence of these contrasts in figures. Relation to our own body is enough.\n\n[18] In the eyes of many it will have seemed strange to call a relation a mere line, and a line a mere sensation. We may easily learn a great deal about any relation, say that between two points: we may divide the line which joins these, and distinguish it, and classify it, and find out its relations by drawing or representing new lines, and so on. But all this further industry has naught to do with our acquaintance with the relation itself, in its first intention. So cognized, the relation is the line and nothing more. It would indeed be fair to call it something less; and in fact it is easy to understand how most of us come to feel as if the line were a much grosser thing than the relation. The line is broad or narrow, blue or red, made by this object or by that alternately, in the course of our experience; it is therefore independent of any one of these accidents; and so, from viewing it as no one of such sensible qualities, we may end by thinking of it as something which cannot be defined except as the negation of all sensible quality whatever, and which needs to be put into the sensations by a mysterious act of 'relating thought.'\n\nAnother reason why we get to feel as if a space-relation must be something other than the mere feeling of a line or angle is that between two positions we can potentially make any number of lines and angles, or and, to suit our purposes, endlessly numerous relations. The sense of this indefinite potentiality cleaves to our words when we speak in a general way of 'relations of place,' and misleads us into supposing that not even any single one of them can be exhaustively equated by a single angle or a single line.\n\n[19] This often happens when the warm and cold points, or the round and pointed ones, are applied to the skin within the limits of a single 'Empfindungskreis.'\n\n[20] Vierordt, Grundriss der Physiologie, 5te Auflage (1877), pp. 326, 436.\n\n[21] Vorlesungen \u00fcb. Menschenu. Thierseele (Leipzig, 1883), i. 214. see also Ladd's Physiological Psychology, pp. 396-8, and compare the account by Cf. Stanley Hall (Mind, x. 571) of the sensations produced by moving a blunt point lightly over the skin. Points of cutting pain, quivering, thrilling, whirling, tickling, scratching, and acceleration, alternated with each other along the surface.\n\n[22] Of the anatomical and physiological conditions of these facts we know as yet but little, and that little need not here be discussed. Two principal hypotheses have been invoked in the case of the retina. Wunt (Menschen- u. Thierseele, i. 214) called attention to the changes of color-sensibility which the retina displays as the image of the colored object passes from the fovea to the periphery. The color alters and becomes darker, and the change is more rapid in certain directions than in others. This alteration in general, however, is one of which, as such, we are wholly unconscious. We see the sky as bright blue all over, the modifications of the blue sensation being interpreted by us, not as differences in the objective color, but as distinctions in its locality. Lotze (Medizinische Psychologie, 333, 355), on the other hand, has pointed out the peculiar tendency which each particular point of the retina has to call forth that movement of the eyeball which will carry the image of the exciting object from the point in question to the fovea. With each separate tendency to movement (as with each actual movement) we may suppose a peculiar modification of sensibility to be conjoined. This modification would constitute the peculiar local tingeing of the image by each point. See also Sully's Psychology, pp. 118-121. Prof. B. Erdman has quite lately (Vierteljahrsschrift f. wiss. Phil.,x. 324-9) denied the existence of all evidence for such immanent qualia of feeling characterizing each locality. Acute as his remarks are, they quite fail to convince me. On the skin the qualia are evident. 1 should say. Where, as on the retina, they are less so (Kries and Auerbach), this may well be a mere difficulty of discrimination not yet educated to the analysis.\n\n[23] 1852, p. 331.\n\n[24] Maybe the localization of intracranial pain is itself due to such association as this of local signs with each other, rather than to their qualitative similarity in neighboring parts (supra, p. 19); though it is conceivable that association and similarity itself should here have one and the same neural basis. If we suppose the sensory nerves from those parts of the body beneath any patch of skin to terminate in the same sensorial brain-tract as those from the skin itself, and if the excitement of any one fibre tends to irradiate through the whole of that tract, the feelings of all fibres going to that tract world presumably both have a similar intrinsic quality, and at the same time tend each to arouse the other. Since the same nerve-trunk in most cases supplies the skin and the parts beneath, the anatomical hypothesis presents nothing improbable.\n\n[25] Unless, indeed, the foot happen to be spontaneously tingling or something of the sort at the moment. The whole surface of the body is always in a state of semi-conscious irritation which needs only the emphasis of attention, or of some accidental inward irritation, to become strong at any point.\n\n[26] It is true that the inside of the fore-arm, though its discriminative sensibility is often less than that of the outside, usually rises very prominently into consciousness when the latter is touched. Its \u00e6sthetic sensibility to contact is a good deal finer. We enjoy stroking it from the extensor to the flexor surface around the ulnar side more than in the reverse direction. Pronating movements give rise to contacts in this order, and are frequently indulged in when the back of the fore-arm feels an object against it.\n\n[27] These facts were first noticed by Wundt: see his Beitr\u00e4ge, p. 140, 208. See also Lamansky, Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, xi. 418.\n\n[28] So far all has been plain sailing, but our course begins to be so tortuous when we descend into minuter detail that I will treat of the more precise determination of locality in a long note. When P recalls an ideal line leading to the fovea the line is felt in its entirety and but vaguely; whilst P, which we supposed to be a single star of actual light, stands out in strong distinction from it. The ground of the distinction between P and the ideal line which it terminates is manifest -P being vivid while the line is faint; but why should P hold the particular position it does at the end of the line, rather than anywhere else -- for example in its middle. That seems something not at all manifest.\n\nTo clear up our thoughts about this latter mystery, let us take the case of an actual line of light, none of whose parts is ideal. The feeling of the line is produced; as we know, when a multitude of retinal points are excited together, each of which when excited separately would give rise to one of the feelings called local signs. Each of these signs is the feeling of a small space. From their simultaneous arousal we might well suppose a feeling of larger space to result. But why is it necessary that in this larger spaciousness the sign a should appear always at one end of the line, z at the other, and m in the middle? For though the line be a unitary streak of light, its several constituent points can nevertheless break out from it, and become alive, each for itself. under the selective eye of attention.\n\nThe uncritical render, giving his first careless glance at the subject, will say that there is no mystery in this, and that 'of course' local signs must appear alongside of each other, each in its own place; -- there is no other way possible. But the more philosophic student, whose business it is to discover difficulties quite as much as to get rid of them, will reflect that it is conceivable that the partial factors might fuse into a larger space, and yet not each be located within it any more than a voice is located in a chorus. He will wonder how, after combining into the line, the points can become severally alive again: the separate puffs of a, 'sirene' no longer strike the ear after they have fused into a certain pitch of sound. He will recall the fact that when, after looking at things with one eye closed, we double, by opening the other eye, the number of retinal points affected, the new retinal sensations do not as a rule appear alongside of the old ones and additional to them, but merely make the old ones seem larger and nearer. Why should the affection of new points on the same retina have so different a result? In fact, we will see no sort of logical connection between (l) the original separate local signs, (2) the line as a unit, (3) the line with the points discriminated in it, and (4) the various nerve-processes which subserve all these different things. We will suspect our local sign of being a very slippery and ambiguous sort of creature. Positionless at first, it no sooner appears in the midst of a gang of companions than it is found maintaining the strictest position of its own, and assigning place to each of its associates. How is this possible? Must we accept what we rejected a, while ago as absurd, and admit the points each to have position in se? Or must we suspect that our whole construction has been fallacious. and that we have tried to conjure up, out of association, qualities which the associates never contained?\n\nThere is no doubt a real difficulty here; and the shortest way of dealing with it would be to confess it insoluble and ultimate. Even if position be not an intrinsic character of any one of those sensations we have called local signs, we must still admit that there is something about every one of them that stands for the potentiality of position, and is the ground why the local sign, when it gets placed at all, gets placed here rather than there. If this 'something' be interpreted as a physiological something, as a mere nerve- process, it is easy to say in a blank way that when it is excited alone, it is an 'ultimate fact' (l) that a positionless spot will appear; that when it is excited together with other similar processes, but without; the process of discriminative attention, it is another 'ultimate fact' (2) that a unitary line will come; and that the final 'ultimate fact' (3) is that, when the nerve-process is excited in combination with that other process which subserves the feeling of attention, what results will be the line with the local sign inside of it determined to a particular place. Thus we should escape the responsibility of explaining by falling back on the everlasting inscrutability of the psyche-neural nexus. The moment we call the ground of localization physiological, we need only point out how, in those cases in which localization occurs, the physiological process differs from those in which it does not, to have done all we can possibly do in the matter. This would be unexceptionable logic. and with it we might let the matter drop, satisfied that there was no self-contradiction in it, but only the universal psychological puzzle of how a new mode of consciousness emerges whenever a fundamentally new mode of nervous action occurs.\n\nBut, blameless as such tactics would logically be on our part, let us see whether we cannot push our theoretic insight a little farther. It seems to me we can. We cannot, it is true, give a reason why the line we feel when process (2) awakens should have its own peculiar shape; nor can we explain the essence of the process of discriminative attention. But we can see why, if the brute facts be admitted that a line may have one of its parts singled out by attention at all, and that that part may appear in relation to other parts at all, the relation must be in the line itself, -- for the line and the parts are the only things supposed to be in consciousness. And we can furthermore suggest a reason why parts appearing thus in relation to each other in a line should fall into an immutable order, and each within that order keep its characteristic place.\n\nIf a lot of such local signs all have any quality which evenly augments as we pass from one to the other, we can arrange them in an ideal serial order, in which any one local sign must lie below those with more, above those with less, of the quality in question. It must divide the series into two parts, -- unless indeed it have a maximum or minimum of the quality, when it either begins or ends it.\n\nSuch an ideal series of local signs in the mind is, however, not yet identical with the feeling of a line in space. Touch a dozen points on the skin successively, and there seems no necessary reason why the notion of a definite line should emerge, even though we be strongly aware of a gradation of quality among the touches. We may of course symbolically arrange then in a line in our thought, but we can always distinguish between a line symbolically thought and a line directly felt.\n\nBut note now the peculiarity of the nerve-processes of all these local signs: though they may give no line when excited successively, when excited together they do give the actual sensation of a line in space. The sum of them is the neural process of that line; the sum of their feelings is the feeling of that line; and if we begin to single out particular points from the line, and notice them by their rank, it is impossible to see how this rank can appear except as an actual fixed space-position sensibly felt as a bit of the total line. The scale itself appearing as a line, rank in it must appear as a definite part of the line. If the seven notes of an octave, when heard together, appeared to the sense of hearing as an outspread line of sound -- which it is needless to say they do not -- why then no one note could be discriminated without being localized, according to its pitch, in the line, either as one of its extremities or as some part between.\n\nBut not alone the gradation of their quality arranges the local-sign feelings in a scale. Our movements arrange them also in a time-scale. Whenever a stimulus passes from point a of the skin or retina to points, it awakens the local-sign feelings in the perfectly definite time-order abcdef. It cannot excite f until cde have been successively aroused. The feeling c sometimes is preceded by ab, sometimes followed by ba, according to the movement's direction; the result of it being that we never feel either a, c, or f, without there clinging to it faint reverberations of the various time-orders of transition in which, throughout past experience, it has been aroused. To the local sign n there clings the tinge or tone, the penumbra or fringe, of the transition bcd. To f, to c, there cling quite different tones. Once admit the principle that a feeling may be tinged by the reproductive consciousness of an habitual transition. even when the transition is not made, and it seems entirely natural to admit that. if the transition be habitually in the order abcdef, and if a, c, and f be felt separately at all, a will be felt with an essential earliness, f with an essential lateness, and that c will fall between. Thus those psychologists who set little stores by local signs and great store by movements in explaining space-perception, would have a perfectly definite time-order, due to motion, by which to account for time definite order of positions that appears when sensitive spots are excited all at once. Without, however, the preliminary admission of the 'ultimate fact' that this collective excitement shall feel like a line and nothing else, it can never be explained why the new order should needs be an order of positions, and not of merely ideal serial rank. We shall hereafter have any amount of opportunity to observe bow thoroughgoing is the participation of motion in all our spatial measurements. Whether the local signs have their respective qualities evenly graduated or not, the feelings of transition must be set down as among the ver\u00e6 caus\u00e6 in localization. But the gradation of the local signs is hardly to be doubted; so we may believe ourselves really to possess two sets of reasons for localizing any point we may happen to distinguish from out the midst of any line or any larger space.\n\n[29] M. Binet (Revue Philosophique, Sept. 1880. page 291) says we judge them locally different as soon as their sensations differ enough for us to distinguish them as qualitatively different when successively excited. This is not strictly true. Skin-sensations, different enough to be discriminated when successive, may still fuse locally if excited both at once.\n\n[30] It may, however, be said that even in the tongue there is a determination of bitter flavors to the back and of acids to the front edge of the organ. Spices likewise affect its sides and front, and a taste like that of slum localizes itself, by its styptic effect on the portion of mucous membrane, which it immediately touches, more sharply than roast pork, for example, which stimulates all parts alike. The pork, therefore, tastes more spacious than the alum or the pepper. In the nose, too, certain smells, of which vinegar may be taken as the type, seem less spatially extended than heavy, suffocating odors, like musk. The reason of this appears to be that the former inhibit inspiration by their sharpness, whilst the fatter are drawn into the lungs, and thus excite an objectively larger surface. The ascription of height and depth to certain notes seems due, not to any localization of the sounds, but to the fact that a feeling of vibration in the chest and tension in the gullet accompanies the singing of a bass note, whilst, when we sing high, the palatine mucous membrane is drawn upon by the muscles which move the larynx, and awakens a feeling in the roof of the mouth.\n\nThe only real objection to the law of partial stimulation laid down in the text is one that might be drawn from the organ of hearing; for, according to modern theories, the cochlea may have its separate nerve-termini exclusively excited by sounds of differing pitch, and yet the sounds seem all to fin a common space, and not necessarily to be arranged alongside of each other. At most the high note is felt as a thinner, brighter streak against a darker background. In an article on Space, published in the Journal of Speculative Philosophy for January, 1879, I ventured to suggest that possibly tile auditory nerve-termini might be \"excited all at once by sounds of any pitch, as the whole retina would be by every luminous point if there were no dioptric apparatus affixed.\" And I added: \" Notwithstanding the brilliant conjectures of the last few years which assign different acoustic end-organs to different rates of air-wave, we are still greatly in the dark about the subject; and I, for my part, would much more confidently reject a theory of hearing which violated the principles advanced in this article than give up those principles for the sake of any hypothesis hitherto published about either organs of Corti or basilar membrane.\" Professor Rutherford's theory of hearing, advanced at the meeting of the British Association for 1886, already furnishes an alternative view which would make hearing present no exception to the space-theory I defend, and which, whether destined to be proved true or false, ought, at any rate, to make us feel that the Helmholtzian theory is probably not the last word in the physiology of hearing. Stepano, ff. (Hermann und Schwalbe's Jahresbericht, xv. 404, Literature 1886) reports a case in which more than the upper half of one cochlea was lost without any such deafness to deep notes on that side as Helmholtz's theory would require\n\n[31] Donaldsan, in Mind, x. 399, 577; Goldscheider, in Archiv f. (Anat. u.) Physiologie; Blix, in Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Biologie. A good r\u00e9sum\u00e9 may be found in Ladd's Physiol. Psychology, part ii. chap. iv. &\u00a7 &\u00a7 21-93.\n\n[32] I tried on nine or ten people, making numerous observations on each, what difference it made in the discrimination of two points to have them alike or unlike. The points chosen were (1) two large needle-heads, (2) two screw-heads, and (3) a needle-head and a screwhead. The distance of the screw-heads was measured from their centres. I found that when the points gave diverse qualities of feeling (as in 3), this facilitated the discrimination. but much less strongly than I expected. The difference, in fact, would often not be perceptible twenty times running When, however, one of the points was endowed with a rotary movement, the other remaining still, the doubleness of the points became much more evident than before. To observe this I took an ordinary pair of compasses with one point blunt, and the movable leg replaced by a metallic rod which could. at any moment, be made to rotate in situ by a dentist's drilling-machine, to which it was attached. The compass had then its points applied to the skin at such a distance apart as to be felt as one impression. Suddenly rotating the drilling apparatus then almost always made them seem as two.\n\n[33] This is only another example of what I call 'the psychologist's fallacy' -- thinking that the mind he is studying must necessarily be conscious of the object after the fashion in which the psychologist himself is conscious of it.\n\n[34] Sitzb. der. k.

It has long since been noticed how much more acute is discrimination of successive than of simultaneous differences. But in the case of a moving impression, say on the retina, we have a summation of both sorts of difference; whereof the natural effect must be to produce the most perfect discrimination of all.\n\nIn the left-hand figure let the dark spot B move, for example, from right to left. At the outset there is the simultaneous contrast of black and white in B and A. When the motion has occurred so that the right-hand figure is produced, the same contrast remains, the black and the white having changed places. But in addition to it there is a double successive contrast, first in A, which, a moment ago white, has now become dark; and second in B, which, a moment ago black, has now become white. If we make each single feeling of contrast = 1 (a supposition far too favorable to the state of rear), the sum of contrasts in the case of motion will be 3, as against 1 in the state of rest. That is, our attention will be called by a treble force to the difference of color, provided the color begin to move. -- (Cf. also Fleischl, Physiologische Optische Notizen, 2te Mittheilung, Wiener Sitzungsberichte, 1882.)\n\n[39] Brown, Bain. J. S. Mill and in a modified manner Wundt, Helmholtz, Sully, etc.\n\n[40] M. Ch. Dunan, in his forcibly written essay 'l'Espace Visuel et l'Espace Tactile' in the Revue Philosophique for 1888, endeavors to prove that surfaces alone give no perception of extent, by citing the way in which the blind go to work to gain an idea of an object's shape. If surfaces were the percipient organ, he says, \"both the seeing and the blind ought to gain an exact idea of the size (and shape) of an object by merely laying their hand flat upon it (provided of course that it were smaller than the hand), and this because of their direct appreciation of the amount of tactile surface affected, and with no recourse to the muscular sense.... But the fact is that a person born blind never proceeds in this way to measure objective surfaces. The only means which he has of getting at the size of a body is that of running his Anger along the lines by which it is bounded. For instance, if you put into the hands of one born blind a book whose dimensions are unknown to him, he will begin by resting it against his chest so as to hold it horizontal; then, bringing his two hands together in the middle of the edge opposite to the one against his body, he will draw them asunder tin they reach the ends of the edge in question: and then, and not tin then, will he be able to say what the length of the object is \" (vol. xxv. p. 148). I think that anyone who will try to appreciate the size and shape of an object by simply 'lying his hand flat upon it' will find that the great obstacle is that he feels the contours so imperfectly. The moment, however, the hands move, the contours are emphatically and distinctly felt. All perception of shape and size is perception of contours, and Ant of all these must be made sharp. Motion does this ; and the impulse to move our organs in perception is primarily due to the craving which we feel to get our surface-sensations sharp. When it comes to the naming and measuring of objects in terms of some common standard we shall see presently how movements help also; but no more in this case than the other do they help, because the quality of extension itself is contributed by the 'muscular sense.'\n\n[41] Fechner describes (Psychophysik, i. 132) a method of equivalents' for measuring tile sensibility of the skin. Two compasses are used, one on the part A. another on the part R, of the surface. The points on B must be adjusted so that their distance apart appears equal to that between the points on A. With the place A constant, the second pair of points must be varied a great deal for every change in the place B. though for the same A and B the relation of the two compasses is remarkably constant, and continues unaltered for months provided but few experiments are made on each day. If, however, we practise daily their difference grows less, in accordance with the law given in the text.\n\n[42] Prof. Jastrow gives as the result of his experiments this general conclusion (Am. Journal of Psychology, iii. 53): \"The space-perceptions of disparate senses are themselves disparate, and whatever harmony there is amongst them we are warranted in regarding as the result of experience. The spacial notions of one deprived of the sense of sight and reduced to the use of the other space-senses must indeed be different from our own. But he continues: \"The existence of the striking disparities between our visual and our other space-perceptions without confusing us, and, indeed, without usually being noticed, can only be explained by the tendency to interpret all dimensions into their visual equivalents.\" But this author gives no reasons for saying 'visual' rather than 'tactile;' and I must continue to think that probabilities point the other way so far as what we call real magnitudes are concerned.\n\n[43] Cf. Lipps on 'Complication,' Grundtatsachen, etc., p. 579.\n\n[44] Ventriloquism shows this very prettily. The ventriloquist talks with out moving his lips, and at the same time draws our attention to a doll, a box, or some other object. We forthwith locate the voice within this object. On the stage an actor ignorant of music sometimes has to sing, or play on the guitar or violin. He goes through the motions before our eyes, whilst in the orchestra or elsewhere the music is performed. But because as we listen we see the actor, it is almost impossible not to hear the music as if coming from where he sits or stands.\n\n[45] Cf. Shand, in Mind, xiii. 340.\n\n[46] See, e.g., Bain's Senses and Intellect, pp. 366-7, 371.\n\n[47] When, for example, a baby looks at its own moving hand, it sees one object at the same time that it feels another. Both interest its attention and it locates them together. But the felt object's size is the more constant size, just as the felt object is, on the whole, the more interesting and important object; and so the retinal sensations become regarded as its signs and have their 'real space values' interpreted in tangible terms.\n\n[48] The incoherence of the different primordial sense-spaces inter se is often made a pretext for denying to the primitive bodily feelings any spatial quality at all. Nothing is commoner than to hear it said : \"Babies have originally no spatial perception; for when a baby's toe aches he does not place the pain in the toe. He makes no definite movements of defence, and may be vaccinated without being held.\" The facts are true enough; but the interpretation is all wrong. What really happens is that the baby does not place his 'toe' in the pain; for he knows nothing of his 'toe' as yet. He has not attended to it as a visual object; he has not handled it with his fingers; nor have its normal organic sensations or contacts yet become interesting enough to be discriminated from the whole massive feeling of the foot, or even of the leg to which it belongs. In short, the toe is neither a member of the babe's optical space, of his hand-movement space, nor an independent member of his leg-and-foot space. It has actually no mental existence yet save as this little pain-space. What wonder then, if the pains seems a little space-world all by itself? But let the pain once associate itself with these other space-worlds, and its space will become part of their space. Let the baby feel the nurse stroking the limb and awakening the pain every time her finger on the toe every time the pain shoots up; let him handle his foot himself and get the whenever the toe comes into his fingers or his mouth; let moving the leg exacerbate the pain -- and all is changed. The space of the pain becomes identified with that part of each of the other spaces which gets felt when it awakens; and by their identity with it these parts are identified with each other, and grow systematically connected as members of a larger extensive whole.\n\n[49] Pourqoi les Sensation visuelles sont elles \u00e9tendues? In Revue Philosophique, iv. 167. -- As the proofs of this chapter are being corrected, I receive the third 'Heft' of M\u00fcnsterberg's Beitr\u00e4ge zur Experimentellen Psychologie, in which that vigorous young psychologist reaffirms (if I understand him after so hasty a glance) more radically than ever the doctrine that muscular sensation proper is our one means of measuring extension. Unable to reopen the discussion here, I am in duty bound to call the attention of the reader to Herr M.'s work.\n\n[50] Even if the figure be drawn on a board instead of in the air, the variations of contact on the finger's surface will be much simpler than the peculiarities of the traced figure itself.\n\n[51] See for example Duchenne, Electrisation locslis\u00e9e, pp. 727, 770; Leyden; Virchow's Archiv, Ed. xlvii.

It is to be noticed that the space suggested to the imagination when the joint moves, and projected to the distance of the finger-tip, is not represented as any specific skin-tract. What the seeing men imagines is a visible path; what the blind man imagines is rather a, generic image, an abstraction from many skin- spaces whose local signs have neutralized each other, and left nothing but their common vastness behind. We shall see as we go on that this generic abstraction of space-magnitude from the various local peculiarities of feeling which accompanied it when it was for the first time felt, occurs on a considerable scale in the acquired perceptions of blind as well as of seeing men.\n\n[57] The ideal enlargement of a system of sensations by the mind is nothing exceptional. Vision is full of it; and in the manual arts, where a workman gets a tool larger than the one he is accustomed to and has suddenly to adapt all his movements to its scale, or where he has to execute a familiar set of movements in an unnatural position of body; where a piano-player meets an instrument with unusually broad or narrow keys: where a man has to alter the size of his handwriting -- we see how promptly the mind multiplies once for all, as it were, the whole series of its operations by a constant factor, and has not to trouble itself after that with further adjustment of the details.\n\n[58] Pfl\u00fcger's Archiv, xlv. 65.\n\n[59] Untersuchungen im Cebiete der Optik, Leipzig (1863), p. 188.\n\n[60] Problems of Life and Mind, prob. vi. chap, iv. &\u00a7 45.\n\n[61] Volkmann, op. cit. p. 189. Compare also what Hering says of the inability in his own case to make after-images seem to move when he rolls his closed eyes in their sockets; and of the insignificance of his feelings of convergence for the sense of distance (Beitr\u00e4ge zur Physiologie, 1861-2, pp. 31, 141). Helmholtz also allows to the muscles of convergence a very feeble share in our sense of the third dimension (Physiologische Optik, 649-59.)\n\n[62] Compare Lipps, Psychologische Studien (1885). p. 18, and the other arguments given on pp. 12 to 27. The most plausible reasons for corrections of the eyeball-muscles being admitted as original contributors to the perception of extent, are those of Wundt, Physiologische Psychologie, ii. 98-100. They are drawn from certain constant errors in our estimate of lines and angles; which, however, are susceptible, all of them, of different interpretations (see some of them further on). -- Just as my MS. goes to the printer, Herr M\u00fcnsterberg's Beitr\u00e4ge zur experimentellen Psychologie, Heft 2, comes into my hands with experiments on the measurement of space recorded in it, which, in the author's view, prove the feeling of muscular strain to be a principal factor in our vision of extent. As M\u00fcnsterberg worked three hours a day for a year and a half at comparing the length of lines, seen with his eyes in different positions; and as he care fully averaged and 'percented ' 20,000 observations, his conclusion must be listened to with great respect. Briefly it is this, that \"our judgments size depend on a comparison of the intensity of the feelings of movement which arise in our eyeball-muscles as we glance over the distance, and which fuse with the sensations of light \"(p. 142). The facts upon which the conclusion is based are certain constant errors which M\u00fcnsterberg found according as the standard or given interval was to the right or the left of the interval to be marked off as equal to it, or as it was above or below it, or stood in some more complicated relation still. He admits that he cannot explain all the errors in detail, and that we \"stand before results which seem surprising and not to be unravelled, because we, cannot analyze the elements which enter into the complex sensation which we receive.\" But he has no doubt whatever of the general fact \"that the movements of the eyes and the sense of their position when fixed exert so decisive an influence on our estimate of the spaces seen, that the errors cannot possibly be explained by anything else than tire movement-feelings and their reproductions in the memory\" (pp. 166, 167). It is presumptuous to doubt a man's opinion when you haven't had his experience; and yet there are a number of points which make me feel like suspending judgment in regard to Herr M.'s dictum. He found, for example, a constant tendency to underestimate intervals lying to the right, and to overestimate intervals lying to the left. He ingeniously explains this as a result of the habit of reading, which trains us to move our eyes easily along straight lines from left to right, whereas in looking from right to left we move them in curved lines across the page. As we measure intervals as straight lines, it costs more muscular effort to measure from right to left than tile other way, and an interval lying to the left seems to us consequently longer than it really is. Now I have been a reader for more years than Herr M\u00fcnsterberg; and yet with me there is a strongly pronounced error the other way. It is the rightward-lying interval which to me seems longer than it really is. Moreover, Herr M. wears concave spectacles, and looked through them with his head fixed. May it not be that some of the errors were due to distortion of the retinal image, as the eye looked no longer through the centre but through the margin of the glass P In short, with all the presumptions which we have seen against muscular contraction being definitely felt as length, I think that there may be explanations of Herr M.'s results which have escaped even his sagacity; and I call for a suspension of judgment until they shall have been confirmed by other observers. I do not myself doubt that our feeling of seen extent may be altered by concomitant muscular feelings. In Chapter XVII (pp. 28-80) we saw many examples of similar alterations, interferences with, or exaltations of, the sensory effect of one nerve-process by another. I do not see why currents from the muscles or eyelids, coming in at the same time with a retinal impression, might not make the latter seem bigger, in the same way that a greater intensity in the retinal stimulation makes it seem bigger; or in the way that a greater extent of surface excited makes the color of the surface seem stronger, or if it be a skin-surface, makes its heat seem greater; or in the way that the coldness of the dollar on the forehead (in Weber's old experiments) made the dollar seem heavier. But this is a physiological way; and the bigness gained is that of the retinal image after all. If I understand M\u00fcnsterberg's meaning, it is quite different from this: the bigness belongs to the muscular feelings, as such, and is merely associated with those of the retina. This is what I deny.\n\n[63] Archiv f. (Anat. u.) Physiol. (1889), p. 542.\n\n[64] Ibid. p. 496.\n\n[65] Ibid. p. 497.

Und., bk. ii. chap. ix. &\u00a7 8.\n\n[71] Philosophical Transactions 1841. In T. K. Abbot's Sight and Touch there is a good discussion of these cases. Obviously, positive cases are of more importance than negative. An under-witted peasant, No\u00e9 M., whose case is described by Dr. Dufour of Laussnne (Guerison d'un Aveuge-N\u00e9, 1876) is much made of by MM. Naville and Dunan; but it seems to me only to show how little some people can deal with new experiences in which others find themselves quickly at home. This man could not even tell whether some of his first objects of sight moved or stood still (p. 9).\n\n[72] What may be the physiological process connected with this increased sensation of depth is hard to discover. It seems to have nothing to do with the parts of the retina affected, since the mere inversion of the picture (by mirrors, reflecting prisms, etc.), without inverting the head, does not seem to bring it about; nothing with sympathetic axial rotation of the eyes, which might enhance the perspective through exaggerated disparity of the two retinal images (see J. J. M\u00fcller, 'Raddrehung u. Tiefendimension,' Leipzig Acad. Berichte, 1875, page 124), for one-eyed persons get it as strongly as those with two eyes. I cannot find it to be connected with any alteration in the pupil or with any ascertainable strain in the muscles of the eye, sympathizing with those of the body. The exaggeration of distance is even greater when we throw the head over backwards and contract our superior recti in getting the view, than when we bend forward and contract the inferior recti. Making the eyes diverge slightly by weak prismatic glasses has no such effect. To me, and to all whom I have asked to repeat the observation, the result is so marked that I do not well understand how such au observer Its Helmboltz, who has carefully examined vision with inverted head, can have overlooked it. (See his Phys. Optik, pp. 433, 723, 728, 772.) I cannot help thinking that anyone who can explain the exaggeration of the depth-sensation in this case will at the same time throw much light on its normal constitution.\n\n[73] In Froriep's Notizen (1838, July), No. 133, is to be found a detailed account, with a picture, of an Estonian girl, Eva Lauk, then fourteen years old, born with neither arms nor legs, which concludes with the following words: 'According to the mother, her intellect developed quite as fast as that of her brother and sisters; in particular, she came as quickly to a right judgment of the size and distance of visible objects although, of course, she had no use of hands.' \" (Schopenhauer, Welt als Wine, ii. 44)\n\n[74] Physiol. Optik. P. 438. Helmholtz's reservation of 'qualities' as much as our judgments of size, shape, and place, and ought by parity of reasoning to be called intellectual products and not sensations. In other places he does treat color as if it were an intellectual product.\n\n[75] It is needless at this point to consider what Helmholtz's views of the nature of the intellectual space-yielding process may be. He vacillates -- we shall later see how.\n\n[76] Op. cit. p. 214.\n\n[77] Before embarking on this new topic it will be well to shelve, once for all, the problem of what is the physiological process that underlies the distance-feeling. Since one-eyed people have it, and are inferior to the two-eyed only in measuring its gradations, it can have no exclusive connection with the double and disparate images produced by binocular parallax. Since people with closed eyes, looking at an after-image, do not Usually see it draw near or recede with varying convergence, it cannot be simply constituted by the convergence-feeling. For the same reason it would appear non-identical with the feeling of accommodation. The differences of apparent parallactic movement between far and near objects as we move our head cannot constitute the distance-sensation, for such differences may be easily reproduced experimentally (in the movements of visible spots against a background) without engendering any illusion of perspective. Finally, it is obvious that visible faintness, dimness, and smallness are not per se the feeling of visible distance, however much in the case of well-known objects they may serve as signs to suggest it.\n\nA certain maximum distance-value. however, being given to the field of view of the moment, whatever it be, the feelings that accompany the processes just enumerated become so many local signs of the gradation of distances within this maximum depth. They help us to subdivide and measure it. Itself, however, is felt as a unit, a total distance-value, determining the vastness of the whole field of view, which accordingly appears as an abyss of a certain volume, and the question still persists, what neural process is it that underlies the sense of this distance-value?\n\nHering, who has tried to explain the gradations within it by the interaction of certain native distance-values belonging to each point of the two retin\u00e6, seems willing to admit that the absolute scale of the space-volume within which the natively fixed relative distances shall appear is not fixed, but determined each time by 'experience in the widest sense of the word ' (Beitr\u00e4ge, p. 344). What he calls the Kernpunkt of this space-volume is the point we are momentarily fixating. The absolute scale of the whole volume depends on the absolute distance at which this Kernpunkt is judged to be from the person of the looker. \"By an alteration of the localization of the Kernpunkt, the inner relations of the seen space are nowise altered; this space in its totality is as a fixed unit, so to speak, displaced with respect to the self of the looker\" (p. 345). But what constitutes the localization of the Kernpunkt itself at any given time, except 'Experience,' i.e., higher cerebral and intellectual processes, involving memory, Hering does not seek to define.\n\nStumpf, the other sensationalist writer who has best realized the difficulties of the problem, thinks that the primitive sensation of distance must have an immediate physical antecedent, either in the shape of \"an organic alteration accompanying the process of accommodation, or else given directly in the specific energy of the optic nerve.\" In contrast with Hering, however, he thinks that it is the absolute distance of the spot fixated which is thus primitively, immediately, and physiologically given, and not the relative distances of other things about this spot. These, he thinks, are originally seen in what, broadly speaking, may be termed one plane with it. Whether the distance of this plane. considered as a phenomenon of our primitive sensibility, be an invariable datum, or susceptible of fluctuation, he does not, if I understand him rightly, undertake dogmatically to decide, but inclines to the former view. For him then, as for Hering, higher cerebral processes of association, under the name of 'Experience,' are the authors of fully one-half part of the distance-perceptions which we at any given time must have.\n\nHering's and Stumpf's theories are reported for the English reader by Mr. Sully (in Mind, iii. pp. 172-6). Mr. Abbott, in his Sight and Touch (pp. 96-8), gives a theory which is to me so obscure that I only refer the reader to its piece, adding that it seems to make of distance a fixed fluctuation of retinal sensation as modified by focal adjustment. Besides these three authors I am ignorant of any, except Panum, who may have attempted to define distance as in any degree an immediate sensation. And with them the direct sensational share is reduced to a very small proportional part, in our completed distance-judgments.\n\nProfessor Lipps, in his singularly acute Psychologische Studien (p. 69 ff.), argues, as Ferrier, in his review of Berkeley (Philosophical Remains, 11. 330 ff.), had argued before him, that it is logically impossible we should perceive the distance of anything from the eye by sight; for a seen distance can only be between seen termini; and one of the termini, in the case of distance from the eye, is the eye itself, which is not seen. Similarly of the distance of two points behind each other: the near one hides the far one, no space is seen between them. For the space between two objects to be seen, both must appear beside each other, then the space in question will be visible. On no other condition is its visibility possible. The conclusion is that things can properly be seen only in what Lipps calls a surface, and that our knowledge of the third dimension must needs be conceptual, not sensational or visually intuitive.\n\nBut no arguments in the world can prove a feeling which actually exists to be impossible. The feeling of depth or distance, of farness or awayness, does actually exist as a fact of our visual sensibility. All that Professor Lipps's reasonings prove concerning it is that it is not linear in its character, or in its immediacy fully homogeneous and consubstantial with the feeling of literal distance between two seen termini; in short, that there are two sorts of optical sensation, each inexplicably due to a peculiar neural process. The neural process is easily discovered, in the case of lateral extension or spreadoutness, to be the number of retinal nerve-ends affected by the light; in the case of pretension or mere farness it is more complicated and, as we have concluded, is still to seek. The two sensible qualities unite in the primitive visual bigness. The measurement of their various amounts against each other obeys the general laws of all such measurements. We discover their equivalencies by means of objects, apply the same units to both, and translate them into each other so habitually that at first they get to seem to us even quite similar in kind. This final appearance of homogeneity may perhaps be facilitated by the fact that in binocular vision two points situated on the prolongation of the optical axis of one of the eyes, so that the near one hides the far one, are by the other eye seen laterally apart. Each eye has in fact a foreshortened lateral view of the other's line of sight. In The London Times for Feb. 8, 1884, is an interesting letter by J. D. Dougal, who tries to explain by this reason why two-eyed rifle-shooting has such advantages over shooting with one eye closed.\n\n[78] Just so, a pair of spectacles held an inch or so from the eyes seem like one large median glass. The faculty of seeing stereoscopic slides single without an instrument is of the utmost utility to the student of physiological optics, and persons with strong eyes can easily acquire it. The only difficulty lies in dissociating the degree of accommodation from the degree of convergence which it usually accompanies. If the right picture is focussed by the right eye, the left by the left eye, the optic axes must either be parallel or converge upon an imaginary point same distance behind the plane of the pictures, according to tile size and distance apart of the pictures. The accommodation, however. has to be made for the plane of the pictures itself, and a near accommodation with a far-off convergence is something which the ordinary use of our eyes never teaches us to effect.\n\n[79] These two observations prove the law of identical direction only for objects which excite the fove\u00e6 or lie in the line of direct looking. Observers skilled in indirect vision can, however, more or less easily verify the law for outlying retinal points.\n\n[80] This essay, published in the Philosophical Transactions, contains the germ of almost all the methods applied since to the study of optical perception. It seems a pity that England, leading off so brilliantly the modern epoch of this study, should so quickly have dropped out of the held. almost all subsequent progress has been made in Germany, Holland, and, longo intervallo, America.\n\n[81] This is no place to report this controversy, but a few bibliographic references may not be inappropriate. Wheatstone's own experiment is in section 12 of his memoir. In favor of his interpretation see Helmholtz, Phys. Opt., pp. 737-9 ; Wundt, Physiol. Psychol., 2te Anfl. p. 144; Nagel, Sehen mit zwei Augen, pp. 78-82. Against Wheatstone see Volkmann. arch. f.

Microscopists, marksmen, or persons one of whose eyes is much better than the other, almost always refer directions to a single eye, as may be seen by the position of the shadow on their face when they point at a candle-flame.\n\n[83] Professor Joseph Le Conte, who believes strongly in the identity-theory, has embodied the latter in R pair of laws of the relation between positions seen single and double, near or far, on the one hand, and convergences and retinal impressions, on the other, which, though complicated, seems to me by far the best descriptive formulation yet made of the normal facts of vision. His account is easily accessible to the reader in his volume 'Sight' in the International Scientific Series, bk. ii c. 3, so I say no more about it now, except that it does not solve any of the difficulties we are noting in the identity-theory, nor account for the other fluctuating perceptions of which we go on to treat.\n\n[84] Naturally it takes a small object at a less distance to cover by its image a constant amount of retinal surface.\n\n[85] Archiv f.

But movements of the eyeball can only explain such appearances of movements as are the same over the whole field. In the windowed board one part of the held seems to move in one way, another part in another. The same is true when we torn from the spiral to look at the wall -- the centre of the field alone swells onto or contracts, the margin does the reverse or remains at rest.

Ought we not to believe that the perception of the third dimension may have arisen without them, since we now see it taking place as well against them as with them ?\" (Physiol.

But this appears to come from an imperfect absorption of the rectangular after-image by the inclined plane at which the eyes look. The cross, with me, is apt to detach itself from this and then look square. I get the illusion better from the circle, whose after-image becomes in various ways elliptical on being projected upon the different surfaces of the room, and cannot then be easily made to look circular again.\n\n[112] In Chapter XVIII, p. 74. I gave a reason why imaginations ought not to be as vivid as sensations. It should be borne in mind that that reason does not apply to these complemental imaginings of the real shape of things actually before our eyes.\n\n[113] Hermann's Handb. der Physiologie. iii. 1. p. 565-71.\n\n[114] Bulletin de 1'Acad\u00e9mie de Belgique, 2me S\u00e9rie, xix.\n\n[115] Wundt seeks to explain all these illusions by the relatively stronger 'feeling of innervation' needed to move the eyeballs upwards,-- a careful study of the muscles concerned is taken to prove this, -- and a consequently greater estimate of the distance traversed. It suffices to remark, however, with Lipps, that were the innervation all, a column of S's placed on top of each other should look each larger than the one below it, and a weather-cock on a steeple gigantic, neither of which is the case. Only the halves of the same object look different in size, because the customary correction for foreshortening bears only on the relations of the parts of special things spread out before us. Of. Wundt, Physiol. Psych., 2te Aufl. ii. 968; Th. Lipps, (frundtatsschen, etc., p. 535.\n\n[116] Hering would pertly solve in this way the mystery of Figs. 60, 61, and 87. No doubt the explanation pertly applies; but the strange cessation of the illusion when we fix the gaze fails to be accounted for thereby.\n\n[117] Helmholtz has sought (Physiol. Optik, p. 715) to explain the divergence of the apparent vertical meridians of the two retin\u00e6, by the manner in which an identical line drawn on the ground before us in the median plane will throw its images on the two eyes respectively. The matter is too technical for description here; the unlearned reader may be referred for it to J. Le Conte's Sight in the Internat. Scient. Series, p. 198 ff. But, for the benefit of those to whom verbatum sat, I cannot help saying that it seems to me that the exactness of the relation of the two meridians -- whether divergent or not, for their divergence differs in individuals and often in one individuals at diverse times -- precludes its being due to the mere habitual falling-off of the image of one objective line on both. Le Conte, e.g., measures their position down to a sixth of a degree, others to tenths. This indicates an organic identity in the sensations of the two retin\u00e6, which the experience of median perspective horizontals may roughly have agreed with, but hardly can have engendered. Wundt explains the divergence as usual, by the Innervationsgef\u00fchl (op. cit. ii. 99 ff.).\n\n[118] Physiol. Optik, p. 547.\n\n[119] \"We can with a short ruler draw a line as long as we please on a plane surface by first drawing one as long as the ruler permits, and then sliding the ruler somewhat along the drawn line and drawing again, etc. If the ruler is exactly straight, we get in this way a straight line. If it is somewhat curved we get a circle. Now, instead of the sliding ruler we use in the field of sight the central spot of distinctest vision impressed with a linear sensation of sight, which at times may be intensified tin it becomes an after-image. We follow, in looking, the direction of this line, and in so doing we slide the line dong itself and get a prolongation of its length. On a plane surface we can carry on this procedure on any sort of a straight or curved ruler, but in the held of vision there is for each direction and movement of the eye only one sort of line which it is possible for us to slide along in its own direction continually.\" These are what Helmholtz calls the 'circles of direction' on the visual held -- lines which he has studied with his usual care.

It is a real optical sensation, seeming introspectively to have nothing to do with locomotor or other suggestions. It is easy to say that 'the Intellect produces it,' but what does that mean?

Bottom Blues Lyrics[Chorus]\nBell bottom blues, you made me cry\nI don't want to lose this feeling\nAnd if I could choose a place to die\nIt would be in your arms\n\n[Verse 1]\nDo you want to see me crawl across the floor to you?\nDo you want to hear me beg you to take me back?\nI'd gladly do it because\nI don't want to fade away\nGive me one more day, please\nI don't want to fade away\nIn your heart I want to stay\nIt's all wrong, but it's all right\nThe way that you treat me baby\nOnce I was strong but I lost the fight\nYou won't find a better loser\n\n[Chorus]\nBell bottom blues, you made me cry\nI don't want to lose this feeling\nAnd if I could choose a place to die\nIt would be in your arms\n\nBell bottom blues, you made me cry\nI don't want to lose this feeling\nAnd if I could choose a place to die\nIt would be in your arms\n\n[Verse 2]\nBell bottom blues, don't say goodbye\nI'm sure we're going to meet again\nAnd if we do, don't you be surprised\nIf you find me with another lover\n\n[Chorus]\nBell bottom blues, you made me cry\nI don't want to lose this feeling\nAnd if I could choose a place to die\nIt would be in your arms\nYou might also like[Outro]\nI don't want to fade away\nGive me one more day please\nI don't want to fade away\nIn your heart I long to stay1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1297993", "artist_names":

Guard LyricsWith handmade silver sparkles\nLike a well-dressed sequined whore\nYour lady-like deceptions\nKeep reaching out for more\nAnd you ask me for nothing\nAnd nothing's not enough\nAnd the fisherman he puts a claim on you\nBut it's nothing but a bluff\n\nSo with jealous hands tied round my back\nI stumble 'cross the floor\nNot knowing how to speak\nI keep reaching for the door\nI know you know me well I say\n'Cause I'm the palace guard\nRemember me, we made love today\nAt the King's bazaar\nAnd you look at me with eyes that never see\nI can feel something start to die inside of me\n\nSo before you show me everything\nThere's something you must know\nI've worked with your friend John the Geek\nAnd his sidewalk travelin show\nI know your childhood tailored dreams are very well disguised\nSo you don't have to fake it anymore it's all been memorized\n\nAnd you speak in wordless freedoms never seen\nNow I realize to you it's all a dream\n\nAnd you speak to me with feelings\nAs real as sealing wax\nAs the nearness dawns the moth is gone\nLeaving trailless tracks\n\nAll you village people\nSing your songs of the morning sunlit sky\nDon't you think it's time we moved along\nSaid the raven to the flyYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1745235", "artist_names": "Paul Revere and the Raiders", "full_title": "Love

oh\n[Interlude]\n\n[Verse 2]\nSits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile\nShe loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while\nShe'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand\nHe says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition\nAnd keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear\nPoor little Greenie\n\n[Chorus]\nThe Jean Genie lives on his back\nThe Jean Genie loves chimney stacks\n(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls\nThe Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoa-oh\n\n[Interlude]\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nHe's so simple minded, he can't drive his module\nHe bites

hand-in-hand\nI've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun\nAnd I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above\nI've seen old men crying at their own gravesides\nI've seen pigs all sitting, watching picture slides\nBut I never seen nothing like you\n\n[Chorus]\nDo ya, do ya want my life (Woman)\nDo ya, do ya want my love (I'm saying)\nDo ya, do ya want my face (I need it)\nDo ya, do ya want my mind\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I heard the crowd singing out of tune\nAs they sat and sang Auld Lang Syne by the light of the moon\nI heard the preachers banging on the drums\nBut I never heard nothing like you\n\n[Bridge]\nIn the country, where the sky touches down on the field\nShe lay her down to rest in the morning sun\nThey come a-running just to get a look, just to feel\nTo touch her long black hair, they don't give a damn\n\n[Chorus]\nAh, do ya, do ya want my life (Woman)\nDo ya, do ya want my love (I'm saying)\nDo ya, do ya want my face (I need it)\nDo ya, do ya want my mind\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, I think you understand what I'm trying to say, woman\nThat is, I'd like to save you for a rainy day, yeah\nI've seen enough of the world to know, baby\nThat I've got to get it all to get it all to grow\n\n[Chorus]\nDo ya, do ya want my life (Woman)\nDo ya, do ya want my love (I'm saying)\nDo ya, do ya want my face (I need it)\nDo ya, do ya want my mind\nYou might also like[Outro]\nAh you got it made\n\nDo ya do ya want my life\nDo ya do ya want my love\nDo ya do ya want my face\nDo ya do ya want my mind\n\nLook out baby, there's a plane a-comingEmbed"}, {"_type":

me come along with her to the land of the dancing dead\n\nBut it's all right, Lady Eleanor\nAll right, Lady Eleanor\nI'm all right where I am\nShe gazed with loving beauty like a mother to a son\nLike living, dying, seeing, being all rolled into one\nThen all at once I heard some music playing in my bones\nThe same old song I'd heard for years, reminding me of home\n\nBut it's all right, Lady Eleanor\nAll right, Lady Eleanor\nI'm all right where I am\n\nThen creeping on towards me, licking lips with tongues of fire\nA host of golden demons screaming lust and base desire\nAnd when it seemed

Please, fuck what you heard\nI'll send you back to your sheep farm so you can fuck what you herd\nHe not a threat to me on a stage or the ring\nJed, go watch Macbeth if you wanna play with a king\nYou shadowboxing with a sun god, you can't compete\nREDRUM: I can write this murder backwards in my sleep\nI got a grade-A hottie with a Playmate body, your girl's like 4'7\", still in grade eight probably\nI should put rings to his grill like the AA Audi\nAnd stomp Soul with the sole of a grey suede Wally\nYou cautious or nervous?

Barney, you're funny, handsome and really quite clever.\nBut you're also a sociopath.\nWell, I count three pros and one con, so How do you still think you have a chance with me? Because you sat here all night.\nYou could've left right away, but you didn't.\nLook, Nora, all those lies-- that's the old me.\nBut I swear to you, I am trying to change.\nYou make me want to change.\nHow do I know that's not a lie? I'll prove it.\nI will prove how serious I am.\nI will not leave this diner until I get a second date with you.\nGood-bye, Barney.\nI'm not kidding.\nThis is a 24-hour diner.\nI'll stay here forever, if I have to-- and I will!

No big deal.\nThis This cost three months rent, and, uh, I've never gotten to wear it, because I bought it for that big event that you invited me to, which then fell through.\nBut, you know what? Don't feel guilty about that.\nWhat big event? That thing with your uncle.\nHis funeral? It didn't fall through, he miraculously came out of a coma.\nAnd I forgive you.\nNow, can I please meet Lenny Kravitz? I did it again! Aw, honey.\nYou got drunk again.\nI can't believe I took the over.\nJust to be clear, \"I did it again\" is not a reference to my current state of inebriation.\nWhat's it a reference to? My name is Marshall Eriksen.\nI'm 33 years old.\nAnd if my potential future employer, Garrison Cootes, is watching this bow down to Beercules! Well, that could be anybody.\nOh, goodness.\nPete, this is Lily Aldrin.\nI'm gonna make this real simple: You're gonna take down that video of Marshall.\nYou know why? Because I'm friends with three girls who dated you in college, and girls tell each other everything.\nEvery tiny detail.\nHuh.\nSo tick-tock, Pete-- tick-tock goes the little wee-wee clock.\nPete's got a little wee-wee? No idea.\nWhat's everyone getting? This was bound to happen eventually.\nI've been trying so hard to suppress, like, my carefree idiot side, that it just rebelled and came out swingin'! It sure did.\nLook at me! I'm a windmill! Who am I kidding? I'm not ready to be a dad.\nI thought that I was, but it's, like my dad never did stuff like that, you know? So what if he did?

"Tertium Quid LyricsTrue, Excellency--as his Highness says,\nThough she's not dead yet, she's as good as stretched\nSymmetrical beside the other two;\nThough he's not judged yet, he's the same as judged,\nSo do the facts abound and superabound:\nAnd nothing hinders, now, we lift the case\nOut of the shade into the shine, allow\nQualified persons to pronounce at last,\nNay, edge in an authoritative word\nBetween this rabble's-brabble of dolts and fools\nWho make up r\u0435asonless unreasoning Rome.\n\"Now for th\u0435 Trial!\" they roar: \"the Trial to test\n\"The truth, weigh husband and weigh wife alike\n\"I' the scales of law, make one scale kick the beam!\"\nLaw's a machine from which, to please the mob,\nTruth the divinity must needs descend\nAnd clear things at the play's fifth act--aha!\nHammer into their noddles who was who\nAnd what was what. I tell the simpletons\n\"Could law be competent to such a feat\n\"'Twere done already: what begins next week\n\"Is end o' the Trial, last link of a chain\n\"Whereof the first was forged three years ago\n\"When law addressed herself to set wrong right,\n\"And proved so slow in taking the first step\n\"That ever some new grievance,--tort, retort,\n\"On one or the other side,--o'ertook i' the game,\n\"Retarded sentence, till this deed of death\n\"Is thrown in, as it were, last bale to boat\n\"Crammed to the edge with cargo--or passengers?\n\"'Trecentos inseris: ohe, jam satis est!\n\"'Huc appelle!'--passengers, the word must be.\"\nLong since, the boat was loaded to my eyes.\nTo hear the rabble and brabble, you'd call the case\nFused and confused past human finding out.\nOne calls the square round, t'other the round square--\nAnd pardonably in that first surprise\nO' the blood that fell and splashed the diagram:\nBut now we've used our eyes to the violent hue\nCan't we look through the crimson and trace lines?\nIt makes a man despair of history,\nEusebius and the established fact--fig's end!\nOh, give the fools their Trial, rattle away\nWith the leash of lawyers, two on either side--\nOne barks, one bites,--Masters Arcangeli\nAnd Spreti,--that's the husband's ultimate hope\nAgainst the Fisc and the other kind of Fisc,\nBound to do barking for the wife: bow--wow!\nWhy, Excellency, we and his Highness here\nWould settle the matter as sufficiently\nAs ever will Advocate This and Fiscal That\nAnd Judge the Other, with even--a word and a wink--\nWe well know who for ultimate arbiter.\nLet us beware o' the basset-table--lest\nWe jog the elbow of Her Eminence,\nJostle his cards,--he'll rap you out a...st!\nBy the window-seat! And here's the Marquis too!\nIndulge me but a moment: if I fail\n--Favoured with such an audience, understand!--\nTo set things right, why, class me with the mob\nAs understander of the mind of man!\nThe mob,--now, that's just how the error comes!\nBethink you that you have to deal with plebs,\nThe commonalty; this is an episode\nIn burgess-life,--why seek to aggrandise,\nIdealise, denaturalise the class?\nPeople talk just as if they had to do\nWith a noble pair that...Excellency, your ear!\nStoop to me, Highness,--listen and look yourselves!\n\nThis Pietro, this Violante, live their life\nAt Rome in the easy way that's far from worst\nEven for their betters,--themselves love themselves,\nSpend their own oil in feeding their own lamp\nThat their own faces may grow bright thereby.\nThey get to fifty and over: how's the lamp?\nFull to the depth o' the wick,--moneys so much;\nAnd also with a remnant,--so much more\nOf moneys,--which there's no consuming now,\nBut, when the wick shall moulder out some day,\nFailing fresh twist of tow to use up dregs,\nWill lie a prize for the passer-by,--to-wit\nAny one that can prove himself the heir,\nSeeing the couple are wanting in a child:\nMeantime their wick swims in the safe broad bowl\nO' the middle rank,--not raised a beacon's height\nFor wind to ravage, nor swung till lamp graze ground\nAs watchman's cresset, he pokes here and there,\nGoing his rounds to probe the ruts i' the road\nOr fish the luck o' the puddle. Pietro's soul\nWas satisfied when crony smirked, \"No wine\n\"Like Pietro's, and he drinks it every day!\"\nHis wife's heart swelled her boddice, joyed its fill\nWhen neighbours turned heads wistfully at church,\nSighed at the load of lace that came to pray.\nWell, having got through fifty years of flare,\nThey burn out so, indulge so their dear selves,\nThat Pietro finds himself in debt at last,\nAs he were any lordling of us all:\nAnd, for the dark begins to creep on day,\nCreditors grow uneasy, talk aside,\nTake counsel, then importune all at once.\nFor if the good fat rosy careless man,\nWho has not laid a ducat by, decease--\nLet the lamp fall, no heir at hand to catch--\nWhy, being childless, there's a spilth i' the street\nO' the remnant, there's a scramble for the dregs\nBy the stranger: so, they grant him no longer day\nBut come in a body, clamour to be paid.\nWhat's his resource? He asks and straight obtains\nThe customary largess, dole dealt out\nTo what we call our \"poor dear shame-faced ones,\"\nIn secret once a month to spare the shame\nO' the slothful and the spendthrift,--pauper-saints\nThe Pope puts meat i' the mouth of, ravens they,\nAnd providence he--just what the mob admires!\nThat is, instead of putting a prompt foot\nOn selfish worthless human slugs whose slime\nHas failed to lubricate their path in life,\nWhy, the Pope picks the first ripe fruit that falls\nAnd gracious puts it in the vermin's way.\nPietro could never save a dollar? Straight\nHe must be subsidised at our expense:\nAnd for his wife--the harmless household sheep\nOne ought not to see harassed in her age--\nJudge, by the way she bore adversity,\nO' the patient nature you ask pity for!\nHow long, now, would the roughest marketman,\nHandling the creatures huddled to the knife,\nHarass a mutton ere she made a mouth\nOr menaced biting? Yet the poor sheep here,\nViolante, the old innocent burgess-wife,\nIn her first difficulty showed great teeth\nFit to crunch up and swallow a good round crime.\nShe meditates the tenure of the Trust,\nFidei commissum is the lawyer-phrase,\nThese funds that only want an heir to take--\nGoes o'er the gamut o' the creditor's cry\nBy semitones from whine to snarl high up\nAnd growl down low, one scale in sundry keys,--\nPauses with a little compunction for the face\nOf Pietro frustrate of its ancient cheer,--\nNever a bottle now for friend at need,--\nComes to a stop on her own frittered lace\nAnd neighbourly condolences thereat,\nThen makes her mind up, sees the thing to do:\nAnd so, deliberately snaps house-book clasp,\nPosts off to vespers, missal beneath arm,\nPasses the proper San Lorenzo by,\nDives down a little lane to the left, is lost\nIn a labyrinth of dwellings best unnamed,\nSelects a certain blind one, black at base,\nBlinking at top,--the sign of we know what,--\nOne candle in a casement set to wink\nStreetward, do service to no shrine inside,--\nMounts thither by the filthy flight of stairs,\nHolding the cord by the wall, to the tip-top,\nGropes for the door i' the dark, ajar of course,\nRaps, opens, enters in: up starts a thing\nNaked as needs be--\"What, you rogue, 'tis you?\n\"Back,--how can I have taken a farthing yet?\n\"Mercy on me, poor sinner that I am!\n\"Here's...why, I took you for Madonna's self\n\"With all that sudden swirl of silk i' the place!\n\"What may your pleasure be, my bonny dame?\"\nYour Excellency supplies aught left obscure?\nOne of those women that abound in Rome,\nWhose needs oblige them eke out one poor trade\nBy another vile one: her ostensible work\nWas washing clothes, out in the open air\nAt the cistern by Citorio; but true trade--\nWhispering to idlers when they stopped and praised\nThe ankles she let liberally shine\nIn kneeling at the slab by the fountain-side,\nThat there was plenty more to criticise\nAt home, that eve, i' the house where candle blinked\nDecorously above, and all was done\nI' the holy fear of God and cheap beside.\nViolante, now, had seen this woman wash,\nNoticed and envied her propitious shape,\nTracked her home to her house-top, noted too,\nAnd now was come to tempt her and propose\nA bargain far more shameful than the first\nWhich trafficked her virginity away\nFor a melon and three pauls at twelve years old.\nFive minutes' talk with this poor child of Eve,\nStruck was the bargain, business at an end--\n\"Then, six months hence, that person whom you trust,\n\"Comes, fetches whatsoever babe it be;\n\"I keep the price and secret, you the babe,\n\"Paying beside for mass to make all straight:\n\"Meantime, I pouch the earnest-money-piece.\"\nDownstairs again goes fumbling by the rope\nViolante, triumphing in a flourish of fire\nFrom her own brain, self-lit by such success,--\nGains church in time for the \"Magnificat\"\nAnd gives forth \"My reproof is taken away,\n\"And blessed shall mankind proclaim me now,\"\nSo that the officiating priest turns round\nTo see who proffers the obstreperous praise:\nThen home to Pietro, the enraptured-much\nBut puzzled-more when told the wondrous news--\nHow orisons and works of charity,\n(Beside that pair of pinners and a coif,\nBirthday surprise last Wednesday was five weeks)\nHad borne fruit in the Autumn of his life,--\nThey, or the Orvieto in a double dose.\nAnyhow, she must keep house next six months,\nLie on the settle, avoid the three-legged stool,\nAnd, chiefly, not be crossed in wish or whim,\nAnd the result was like to be an heir.\n\nAccordingly, when time was come about,\nHe found himself the sire indeed of this\nFrancesca Vittoria Pompilia and the rest\nO' the names whereby he sealed her his next day.\nA crime complete in its way is here, I hope?\nLies to God, lies to man, every way lies\nTo nature and civility and the mode:\nFlat robbery of the proper heirs thus foiled\nO' the due succession,--and, what followed thence,\nRobbery of God, through the confessor's ear\nDebarred the most noteworthy incident\nWhen all else done and undone twelve-month through\nWas put in evidence at Easter-time.\nAll other peccadillos!--but this one\nTo the priest who comes next day to dine with us?\n'Twere inexpedient; decency forbade.\n\nIs so far clear? You know Violante now,\nCompute her capability of crime\nBy this authentic instance? Black hard cold\nCrime like a stone you kick up with your foot\nI' the middle of a field?\n\nI thought as much.\nBut now, a question,--how long does it lie,\nThe bad and barren bit of stuff you kick,\nBefore encroached on and encompassed round\nWith minute moss, weed, wild-flower--made alive\nBy worm, and fly, and foot of the free bird?\nYour Highness,--healthy minds let bygones be,\nLeave old crimes to grow young and virtuous-like\nI' the sun and air; so time treats ugly deeds:\nThey take the natural blessing of all change.\nThere was the joy o' the husband silly-sooth,\nThe softening of the wife's old wicked heart,\nVirtues to right and left, profusely paid\nIf so they might compensate the saved sin.\nAnd then the sudden existence, dewy-dear,\nO' the rose above the dungheap, the pure child\nAs good as new created, since withdrawn\nFrom the horror of the pre-appointed lot\nWith the unknown father and the mother known\nToo well,--some fourteen years of squalid youth,\nAnd then libertinage, disease, the grave--\nHell in life here, hereafter life in hell:\nLook at that horror and this soft repose!\nWhy, moralist, the sin has saved a soul!\nThen, even the palpable grievance to the heirs--\n'Faith, this was no frank setting hand to throat\nAnd robbing a man, but...Excellency, by your leave,\nHow did you get that marvel of a gem,\nThe sapphire with the Graces grand and Greek?\nThe story is, stooping to pick a stone\nFrom the pathway through a vineyard--no-man's-land--\nTo pelt a sparrow with, you chanced on this:\nWhy, now, do those five clowns o' the family\nO' the vinedresser digest their porridge worse\nThat not one keeps it in his goatskin pouch\nTo do flints'-service with the tinder-box?\nDon't cheat me, don't cheat you, don't cheat a friend!\nBut are you so hard on who jostles just\nA stranger with no natural sort of claim\nTo the havings and the holdings (here's the point)\nUnless by misadventure, and defect\nOf that which ought to be--nay, which there's none\nWould dare so much as wish to profit by--\nSince who dares put in just so many words\n\"May Pietro fail to have a child, please God!\n\"So shall his house and goods belong to me,\n\"The sooner that his heart will pine betimes?\"\nWell then, God don't please, nor his heart shall pine!\nBecause he has a child at last, you see,\nOr selfsame thing as though a child it were,\nHe thinks, whose sole concern it is to think:\nIf he accepts it why should you demur?\n\nMoreover, say that certain sin there seem,\nThe proper process of unsinning sin\nIs to begin well-doing somehow else.\nPietro,--remember, with no sin at all\nI' the substitution,--why, this gift of God\nFlung in his lap from over Paradise\nSteadied him in a moment, set him straight\nOn the good path he had been straying from.\nHenceforward no more wilfulness and waste,\nCuppings, carousings,--these a sponge wiped out.\nAll sort of self-denial was easy now\nFor the child's sake, the chatelaine to be,\nWho must want much and might want who knows what?\nAnd so, the debts were paid, habits reformed,\nExpense curtailed, the dowry set to grow.\nAs for the wife,--I said, hers the whole sin:\nSo, hers the exemplary penance. 'Twas a text\nWhereon folk preached and praised, the district through:\n\"Oh, make us happy and you make us good!\n\"It all comes of God giving her a child:\n\"Such graces follow God's best earthly gift!\"\n\nHere you put by my guard, pass to my heart\nBy the home-thrust--\"There's a lie at base of all.\"\nWhy, thou exact Prince, is it a pearl or no,\nYon globe upon the Principessa's neck?\nThat great round glory of pellucid stuff,\nA fish secreted round a grain of grit!\nDo you call it worthless for the worthless core?\n(She don't, who well knows what she changed for it!)\nSo, to our brace of burgesses again!\nYou see so far i' the story, who was right,\nWho wrong, who neither, don't you? What, you don't?\nEh? Well, admit there's somewhat dark i' the case,\nLet's on--the rest shall clear, I promise you.\nLeap over a dozen years: you find, these passed,\nAn old good easy creditable sire,\nA careful housewife's beaming bustling face,\nBoth wrapped up in the love of their one child,\nThe strange tall pale beautiful creature grown\nLily-like out o' the cleft i' the sun-smit rock\nTo bow its white miraculous birth of buds\nI' the way of wandering Joseph and his spouse,--\nSo painters fancy: here it was a fact.\nAnd this their lily,--could they but transplant\nAnd set in vase to stand by Solomon's porch\n'Twixt lion and lion!--this Pompilia of theirs,\nCould they see worthily married, well bestowed\nIn house and home! And why despair of this\nWith Rome to choose from, save the topmost rank?\nThemselves would help the choice with heart and soul,\nThrow their late savings in a common heap\nShould go with the dowry, to be followed in time\nBy the heritage legitimately hers:\nAnd when such paragon was found and fixed,\nWhy, they might chant their \"Nunc dimittis\" straight.\n\nIndeed the prize was simply full to a fault;\nExorbitant for the suitor they should seek,\nAnd social class to choose among, these cits.\nYet there's a latitude: exceptional white\nAmid the general brown o' the species, lurks\nA burgess nearly an aristocrat,\nLegitimately in reach: look out for him!\nWhat banker, merchant, has seen better days,\nWhat second-rate painter a-pushing up,\nPoet a-slipping down, shall bid the best\nFor this young beauty with the thumping purse?\nAlack, had it been but one of such as these\nSo like the real thing they may pass for it,\nAll had gone well! Unluckily fate must needs\nIt proved to be the impossible thing itself;\nThe truth and not the sham: hence ruin to them all.\n\nFor, Guido Franceschini was the head\nOf an old family in Arezzo, old\nTo that degree they could afford be poor\nBetter than most: the case is common too.\nOut of the vast door 'scutcheoned overhead,\nCreeps out a serving-man on Saturdays\nTo cater for the week,--turns up anon\nI' the market, chaffering for the lamb's least leg,\nOr the quarter-fowl, less entrails, claws and comb:\nThen back again with prize,--a liver begged\nInto the bargain, gizzard overlooked,--\nHe's mincing these to give the beans a taste,\nWhen, at your knock, he leaves the simmering soup,\nWaits on the curious stranger-visitant,\nNapkin in half-wiped hand, to show the rooms,\nPoint pictures out have hung their hundred years,\n\"Priceless,\" he tells you,--puts in his place at once\nThe man of money: yes, you're banker-king\nOr merchant-kaiser, wallow in your wealth\nWhile patron, the house-master, can't afford\nTo stop our ceiling-hole that rain so rots--\nBut he's the man of mark, and there's his shield,\nAnd yonder's the famed Rafael, first in kind,\nThe painter painted for his grandfather--\nYou have paid a paul to see: \"Good-morning, Sir!\"\nSuch is the law of compensation. Here\nThe poverty was getting too acute;\nThere gaped so many noble mouths to feed,\nBeans must suffice unflavoured of the fowl.\nThe mother,--hers would be a spun-out life\nI' the nature of things; the sisters had done well\nAnd married men of reasonable rank:\nBut that sort of illumination stops,\nThrows back no heat upon the parent-hearth.\nThe family instinct felt out for its fire\nTo the Church,--the Church traditionally helps\nA second son: and such was Paolo,\nEstablished here at Rome these thirty years,\nWho played the regular game,--priest and Abate,\nMade friends, owned house and land, became of use\nTo a personage: his course lay clear enough.\nThe youngest caught the sympathetic flame,\nAnd, though unfledged wings kept him still i' the cage,\nYet he shot up to be a Canon, so\nClung to the higher perch and crowed in hope.\nEven our Guido, eldest brother, went\nAs far i' the way o' the Church as safety seemed,\nHe being Head o' the House, ordained to wive,--\nSo, could but dally with an Order or two\nAnd testify good-will i' the cause: he clipt\nHis top-hair and thus far affected Christ,\nBut main promotion must fall otherwise,\nThough still from the side o' the Church: and here was he\nAt Rome, since first youth, worn threadbare of soul\nBy forty-six years' rubbing on hard life,\nGetting fast tired o' the game whose word is--\"Wait!\"\nWhen one day,--he too having his Cardinal\nTo serve in some ambiguous sort, as serve\nTo draw the coach the plumes o' the horses' heads,--\nThe Cardinal saw fit to dispense with him,\nRide with one plume the less; and off it dropped.\n\nGuido thus left,--with a youth spent in vain\nAnd not a penny in purse to show for it,\nAdvised with Paolo, bent no doubt in chafe\nThe black brows somewhat formidably the while.\n\"Where is the good I came to get at Rome?\n\"Where the repayment of the servitude\n\"To a purple popinjay, whose feet I kiss,\n\"Knowing his father wiped the shoes of mine?\"\n\n\"Patience,\" pats Paolo the recalcitrant--\n\"You have not had, so far, the proper luck,\n\"Nor do my gains suffice to keep us both:\n\"A modest competency is mine, not more.\n\"You are the Count however, yours the style,\n\"Heirdom and state,--you can't expect all good.\n\"Had I, now, held your hand of cards...well, well--\n\"What's yet unplayed, I'll look at, by your leave,\n\"Over your shoulder,--I who made my game,\n\"Let's see, if I can't help to handle yours.\n\"Fie on you, all the Honours in your fist,\n\"Countship, Househeadship,--how have you misdealt!\n\"Why, in the first place, they will marry a man!\n\"Notum tonsoribus! To the Tonsor then!\n\"Come, clear your looks, and choose your freshest suit,\n\"And, after function's done with, down we go\n\"To the woman-dealer in perukes, a wench\n\"I and some others settled in the shop\n\"At Place Colonna: she's an oracle. Hmm!\n\"'Dear, 'tis my brother: brother, 'tis my dear.\n\"'Dear, give us counsel! Whom do you suggest\n\"'As properest party in the quarter round,\n\"'For the Count here?--he is minded to take wife,\n\"'And further tells me he intends to slip\n\"'Twenty zecchines under the bottom-scalp\n\"'Of his old wig when he sends it to revive\n\"'For the wedding: and I add a trifle too.\n\"'You know what personage I'm potent with.'\"\nAnd so plumped out Pompilia's name the first.\nShe told them of the household and its ways,\nThe easy husband and the shrewder wife\nIn Via Vittoria,--how the tall young girl,\nWith hair black as yon patch and eyes as big\nAs yon pomander to make freckles fly,\nWould have so much for certain, and so much more\nIn likelihood,--why, it suited, slipt as smooth\nAs the Pope's pantoufle does on the Pope's foot.\n\"I'll to the husband!\" Guido ups and cries.\n\"Ay, so you'd play your last court-card, no doubt!\"\nPuts Paolo in with a groan--\"Only, you see,\n\"'Tis I, this time, that supervise your lead.\n\"Priests play with women, maids, wives, mothers,--why?\n\"These play with men and take them off our hands.\n\"Did I come, counsel with some cut-beard gruff\n\"Or rather this sleek young-old barberess?\n\"Go, brother, stand you rapt in the ante-room\n\"Of Her Efficacity my Cardinal\n\"For an hour,--he likes to have lord-suitors lounge,--\n\"While I betake myself to the grey mare,\n\"The better horse,--how wise the people's word!--\n\"And wait on Madam Violante.\"\n\nSaid and done.\nHe was at Via Vittoria in three skips:\nProposed at once to fill up the one want\nO' the burgess-family which, wealthy enough,\nAnd comfortable to heart's desire, yet crouched\nOutside a gate to heaven,--locked, bolted, barred,\nWhereof Count Guido had a key he kept\nUnder his pillow, but Pompilia's hand\nMight slide behind his neck and pilfer thence.\nThe key was fairy; mention of it made\nViolante feel the thing shoot one sharp ray\nThat reached the heart o' the woman. \"I assent:\n\"Yours be Pompilia, hers and ours that key\n\"To all the glories of the greater life!\n\"There's Pietro to convince: leave that to me!\"\n\nThen was the matter broached to Pietro; then\nDid Pietro make demand and get response\nThat in the Countship was a truth, but in\nThe counting up of the Count's cash, a lie:\nHe thereupon stroked grave his chin, looked great,\nDeclined the honour. Then the wife wiped one--\nWinked with the other eye turned Paolo-ward,\nWhispered Pompilia, stole to church at eve,\nFound Guido there and got the marriage done,\nAnd finally begged pardon at the feet\nOf her dear lord and master. Whereupon\nQuoth Pietro--\"Let us make the best of things!\"\n\"I knew your love would licence us,\" quoth she:\nQuoth Paolo once more, \"Mothers, wives, and maids,\n\"These be the tools wherewith priests manage men.\"\n\nNow, here take breath and ask,--which bird o' the brace\nDecoyed the other into clapnet? Who\nWas fool, who knave? Neither and both, perchance.\nThere was a bargain mentally proposed\nOn each side, straight and plain and fair enough;\nMind knew its own mind: but when mind must speak,\nThe bargain have expression in plain terms,\nThere was the blunder incident to words,\nAnd in the clumsy process, fair turned foul,\nThe straight backbone-thought of the crooked speech\nWere just--\"I Guido truck my name and rank\n\"For so much money and youth and female charms.\"--\n\"We Pietro and Violante give our child\n\"And wealth to you for a rise i' the world thereby.\"\nSuch naked truth while chambered in the brain\nShocks nowise: walk it forth by way of tongue,--\nOut on the cynical unseemliness!\nHence was the need, on either side, of a lie\nTo serve as decent wrappage: so, Guido gives\nMoney for money,--and they, bride for groom,\nHaving, he, not a doit, they, not a child\nHonestly theirs, but this poor waif and stray.\nAccording to the words, each cheated each;\nBut in the inexpressive barter of thoughts,\nEach did give and did take the thing designed,\nThe rank on this side and the cash on that--\nAttained the object of the traffic, so.\nThe way of the world, the daily bargain struck\nIn the first market! Why sells Jack his ware?\n\"For the sake of serving an old customer.\"\nWhy does Jill buy it? \"Simply not to break\n\"A custom, pass the old stall the first time.\"\nWhy, you know where the gist is of the exchange:\nEach sees a profit, throws the fine words in.\nDon't be too hard o' the pair! Had each pretence\nBeen simultaneously discovered, stripped\nFrom off the body o' the transaction, just\nAs when a cook...will Excellency forgive?\nStrips away those long loose superfluous legs\nFrom either side the crayfish, leaving folk\nA meal all meat henceforth, no garnishry,\n(With your respect, Prince!)--balance had been kept,\nNo party blamed the other,--so, starting fair,\nAll subsequent fence of wrong returned by wrong\nI' the matrimonial thrust and parry, at least\nHad followed on equal terms. But, as it chanced,\nOne party had the advantage, saw the cheat\nOf the other first and kept its own concealed:\nAnd the luck o' the first discovery fell, beside,\nTo the least adroit and self-possessed o' the pair.\n'Twas foolish Pietro and his wife saw first\nThe nobleman was penniless, and screamed\n\"We are cheated!\"\n\nSuch unprofitable noise\nAngers at all times: but when those who plague,\nDo it from inside your own house and home,\nGnats which yourself have closed the curtain round,\nNoise goes too near the brain and makes you mad.\nThe gnats say, Guido used the candle flame\nUnfairly,--worsened that first bad of his,\nBy practise of all kind of cruelty\nTo oust them and suppress the wail and whine,--\nThat speedily he so scared and bullied them,\nFain were they, long before five months were out,\nTo beg him grant, from what was once their wealth,\nJust so much as would help them back to Rome\nWhere, when they had finished paying the last doit\nO' the dowry, they might beg from door to door.\nSo say the Comparini--as if it were\nIn pure resentment for this worse than bad,\nThat then Violante, feeling conscience prick,\nConfessed her substitution of the child\nWhence all the harm came,--and that Pietro first\nBethought him of advantage to himself\nI' the deed, as part revenge, part remedy\nFor all miscalculation in the pact.\n\nOn the other hand \"Not so!\" Guido retorts--\n\"I am the wronged, solely, from first to last,\n\"Who gave the dignity I engaged to give,\n\"Which was, is, cannot but continue gain.\n\"My being poor was a bye-circumstance,\n\"Miscalculated piece of untowardness,\n\"Might end to-morrow did heaven's windows ope,\n\"Or uncle die and leave me his estate.\n\"You should have put up with the minor flaw,\n\"Getting the main prize of the jewel. If wealth,\n\"Not rank, had been prime object in your thoughts,\n\"Why not have taken the butcher's son, the boy\n\"O' the baker or candlestick-maker? In all the rest,\n\"It was yourselves broke compact and played false,\n\"And made a life in common impossible.\n\"Show me the stipulation of our bond\n\"That you should make your profit of being inside\n\"My house, to hustle and edge me out o' the same.\n\"First make a laughing-stock of mine and me,\n\"Then round us in the ears from morn to night\n\"(Because we show wry faces at your mirth)\n\"That you are robbed, starved, beaten, and what not!\n\"You fled a hell of your own lighting-up,\n\"Pay for your own miscalculation too:\n\"You thought nobility, gained at any price,\n\"Would suit and satisfy,--find the mistake,\n\"And now retaliate, not on yourselves, but me.\n\"And how? By telling me, i' the face of the world,\n\"I it is have been cheated all this while,\n\"Abominably and irreparably,--my name\n\"Given to a cur-cast mongrel, a drab's brat,\n\"A beggar's bye-blow,--thus depriving me\n\"Of what yourselves allege the whole and sole\n\"Aim on my part i' the marriage,--money to-wit.\n\"This thrust I have to parry by a guard\n\"Which leaves me open to a counter-thrust\n\"On the other side,--no way but there's a pass\n\"Clean through me. If I prove, as I hope to do,\n\"There's not one truth in this your odious tale\n\"O' the buying, selling, substituting--prove\n\"Your daughter was and is your daughter,--well,\n\"And her dowry hers and therefore mine,--what then?\n\"Why, where's the appropriate punishment for this\n\"Enormous lie hatched for mere malice' sake\n\"To ruin me? Is that a wrong or no?\n\"And if I try revenge for remedy,\n\"Can I well make it strong and bitter enough?\"\n\nI anticipate however--only ask,\nWhich of the two here sinned most? A nice point!\nWhich brownness is least black,--decide who can,\nWager-by-battle-of-cheating! What do you say,\nHighness? Suppose, your Excellency, we leave\nThe question at this stage, proceed to the next,\nBoth parties step out, fight their prize upon,\nIn the eye o' the world?\n\nThey brandish law 'gainst law;\nThe grinding of such blades, each parry of each,\nThrows terrible sparks off, over and above the thrusts,\nAnd makes more sinister the fight, to the eye,\nThan the very wounds that follow. Beside the tale\nWhich the Comparini have to re-assert,\nThey needs must write, print, publish all abroad\nThe straitnesses of Guido's household life--\nThe petty nothings we bear privately\nBut break down under when fools flock around.\nWhat is it all to the facts o' the couple's case,\nHow helps it prove Pompilia not their child,\nIf Guido's mother, brother, kith and kin\nFare ill, lie hard, lack clothes, lack fire, lack food?\nThat's one more wrong than needs.\n\nOn the other hand,\nGuido,--whose cue is to dispute the truth\nO' the tale, reject the shame it throws on him,--\nHe may retaliate, fight his foe in turn\nAnd welcome, we allow. Ay, but he can't!\nHe's at home, only acts by proxy here:\nLaw may meet law,--but all the gibes and jeers,\nThe superfluity of naughtiness,\nThose libels on his House,--how reach at them?\nTwo hateful faces, grinning all a-glow,\nNot only make parade of spoil they filched,\nBut foul him from the height of a tower, you see.\nUnluckily temptation is at hand--\nTo take revenge on a trifle overlooked,\nA pet lamb they have left in reach outside,\nWhose first bleat, when he plucks the wool away,\nWill strike the grinners grave: his wife remains\nWho, four months earlier, some thirteen years old,\nNever a mile away from mother's house\nAnd petted to the height of her desire,\nWas told one morning that her fate was come,\nShe must be married--just as, a month before,\nHer mother told her she must comb her hair\nAnd twist her curls into one knot behind.\nThese fools forgot their pet lamb, fed with flowers,\nThen 'ticed as usual by the bit of cake,\nOut of the bower into the butchery.\nPlague her, he plagues them threefold: but how plague?\nThe world may have its word to say to that:\nYou can't do some things with impunity.\nWhat remains...well, it is an ugly thought...\nBut that he drive herself to plague herself--\nHerself disgrace herself and so disgrace\nWho seek to disgrace Guido?\n\nThere's the clue\nTo what else seems gratuitously vile,\nIf, as is said, from this time forth the rack\nWas tried upon Pompilia: 'twas to wrench\nHer limbs into exposure that brings shame.\nThe aim o' the cruelty being so crueller still,\nThat cruelty almost grows compassion's self\nCould one attribute it to mere return\nO' the parents' outrage, wrong avenging wrong.\nThey see in this a deeper deadlier aim,\nNot to vex just a body they held dear,\nBut blacken too a soul they boasted white,\nAnd show the world their saint in a lover's arms,\nNo matter how driven thither,--so they say.\n\nOn the other hand, so much is easily said,\nAnd Guido lacks not an apologist.\nThe pair had nobody but themselves to blame,\nBeing selfish beasts throughout, no less, no more:\n--Cared for themselves, their supposed good, nought else,\nAnd brought about the marriage; good proved bad,\nAs little they cared for her its victim--nay,\nMeant she should stay behind and take the chance,\nIf haply they might wriggle themselves free.\nThey baited their own hook to catch a fish\nWith this poor worm, failed o' the prize, and then\nSought how to unbait tackle, let worm float\nOr sink, amuse the monster while they 'scaped.\nUnder the best stars Hymen brings above,\nHad all been honesty on either side,\nA common sincere effort to good end,\nStill, this would prove a difficult problem, Prince!\n--Given, a fair wife, aged thirteen years,\nA husband poor, care-bitten, sorrow-sunk,\nLittle, long-nosed, bush-bearded, lantern-jawed,\nForty-six-years full,--place the two grown one,\nShe, cut off sheer from every natural aid,\nIn a strange town with no familiar face--\nHe, in his own parade-ground or retreat\nAs need were, free from challenge, much less check\nTo an irritated, disappointed will--\nHow evolve happiness from such a match?\n'Twere hard to serve up a congenial dish\nOut of these ill-agreeing morsels, Duke,\nBy the best exercise of the cook's craft,\nBest interspersion of spice, salt and sweet!\nBut let two ghastly scullions concoct mess\nWith brimstone, pitch, vitriol, and devil's-dung--\nThrow in abuse o' the man, his body and soul,\nKith, kin, and generation, shake all slab\nAt Rome, Arezzo, for the world to nose,\nThen end by publishing, for fiend's arch-prank,\nThat, over and above sauce to the meat's self,\nWhy, even the meat, bedevilled thus in dish,\nWas never a pheasant but a carrion-crow--\nPrince, what will then the natural loathing be?\nWhat wonder if this?--the compound plague o' the pair\nPricked Guido,--not to take the course they hoped,\nThat is, submit him to their statement's truth,\nAccept its obvious promise of relief,\nAnd thrust them out of doors the girl again\nSince the girl's dowry would not enter there,\n--Quit of the one if baulked of the other: no!\nRather did rage and hate so work in him,\nTheir product proved the horrible conceit\nThat he should plot and plan and bring to pass\nHis wife might, of her own free will and deed,\nRelieve him of her presence, get her gone,\nAnd yet leave all the dowry safe behind,\nConfirmed his own henceforward past dispute,\nWhile blotting out, as by a belch of hell,\nTheir triumph in her misery and death.\n\nYou see, the man was Aretine, had touch\nO' the subtle air that breeds the subtle wit;\nWas noble too, of old blood thrice-refined\nThat shrinks from clownish coarseness in disgust:\nAllow that such an one may take revenge,\nYou don't expect he'll catch up stone and fling,\nOr try cross-buttock, or whirl quarter-staff?\nInstead of the honest drubbing clowns bestow,\nWhen out of temper at the dinner spoilt,\nOn meddling mother-in-law and tiresome wife,--\nSubstitute for the clown a nobleman,\nAnd you have Guido, practising, 'tis said,\nUnmitigably from the very first,\nThe finer vengeance: this, they say, the fact\nO' the famous letter shows--the writing traced\nAt Guido's instance by the timid wife\nOver the pencilled words himself writ first--\nWherein she, who could neither write nor read,\nWas made unblushingly declare a tale\nTo the brother, the Abate then in Rome,\nHow her putative parents had impressed,\nOn their departure, their enjoinment; bade\n\"We being safely arrived here, follow, you!\n\"Poison your husband, rob, set fire to all,\n\"And then by means o' the gallant you procure\n\"With ease, by helpful eye and ready tongue,\n\"The brave youth ready to dare, do, and die,\n\"You shall run off and merrily reach Rome\n\"Where we may live like flies in honey-pot:\"--\nSuch being exact the programme of the course\nImputed her as carried to effect.\n\nThey also say,--to keep her straight therein,\nAll sort of torture was piled, pain on pain,\nOn either side Pompilia's path of life,\nBuilt round about and over against by fear,\nCircumvallated month by month, and week\nBy week, and day by day, and hour by hour,\nClose, closer and yet closer still with pain,\nNo outlet from the encroaching pain save just\nWhere stood one saviour like a piece of heaven,\nHell's arms would strain round but for this blue gap.\nShe, they say further, first tried every chink,\nEvery imaginable break i' the fire,\nAs way of escape: ran to the Commissary,\nWho bade her not malign his friend her spouse;\nFlung herself thrice at the Archbishop's feet,\nWhere three times the Archbishop let her lie,\nSpend her whole sorrow and sob full heart forth,\nAnd then took up the slight load from the ground\nAnd bore it back for husband to chastise,--\nMildly of course,--but natural right is right.\nSo went she slipping ever yet catching at help,\nMissing the high till come to lowest and last,\nNo more than a certain friar of mean degree,\nWho heard her story in confession, wept,\nCrossed himself, showed the man within the monk.\n\"Then, will you save me, you the one i' the world?\n\"I cannot even write my woes, nor put\n\"My prayer for help in words a friend may read,--\n\"I no more own a coin than have an hour\n\"Free of observance,--I was watched to church,\n\"Am watched now, shall be watched back presently,--\n\"How buy the skill of scribe i' the market-place?\n\"Pray you, write down and send whatever I say\n\"O' the need I have my parents take me hence!\"\nThe good man rubbed his eyes and could not choose--\nLet her dictate her letter in such a sense\nThat parents, to save breaking down a wall,\nMight lift her over: she went back, heaven in her heart.\nThen the good man took counsel of his couch,\nWoke and thought twice, the second thought the best:\n\"Here am I, foolish body that I be,\n\"Caught all but pushing, teaching, who but I,\n\"My betters their plain duty,--what, I dare\n\"Help a case the Archbishop would not help,\n\"Mend matters, peradventure, God loves mar?\n\"What hath the married life but strifes and plagues\n\"For proper dispensation? So a fool\n\"Once touched the ark,--poor Hophni that I am!\n\"Oh married ones, much rather should I bid,\n\"In patience all of ye possess your souls!\n\"This life is brief and troubles die with it:\n\"Where were the prick to soar up homeward else?\"\nSo saying, he burnt the letter he had writ,\nSaid Ave for her intention, in its place,\nTook snuff and comfort, and had done with all.\nThen the grim arms stretched yet a little more\nAnd each touched each, all but one streak i' the midst,\nWhereat stood Caponsacchi, who cried, \"This way,\n\"Out by me! Hesitate one moment more\n\"And the fire shuts out me and shuts in you!\n\"Here my hand holds you life out!\" Whereupon\nShe clasped the hand, which closed on hers and drew\nPompilia out o' the circle now complete.\nWhose fault or shame but Guido's?--ask her friends.\n\nBut then this is the wife's--Pompilia's tale--\nEve's...no, not Eve's, since Eve, to speak the truth,\nWas hardly fallen (our candour might pronounce)\nSo much of paradisal nature, Eve's,\nWhen simply saying in her own defence\n\"The serpent tempted me and I did eat.\"\nHer daughters ever since prefer to urge\n\"Adam so starved me I was fain accept\n\"The apple any serpent pushed my way.\"\nWhat an elaborate theory have we here,\nIngeniously nursed up, pretentiously\nBrought forth, pushed forward amid trumpet-blast,\nTo account for the thawing of an icicle,\nShow us there needed Aetna vomit flame\nEre run the crystal into dew-drops! Else,\nHow, unless hell broke loose to cause the step,\nHow could a married lady go astray?\nBless the fools! And 'tis just this way they are blessed,\nAnd the world wags still,--because fools are sure\n--Oh, not of my wife nor your daughter! No!\nBut of their own: the case is altered quite.\nLook now,--last week, the lady we all love,--\nDaughter o' the couple we all venerate,\nWife of the husband we all cap before,\nMother o' the babes we all breathe blessings on,--\nWas caught in converse with a negro page.\nHell thawed that icicle, else \"Why was it--\n\"Why?\" asked and echoed the fools. \"Because, you fools,--\"\nSo did the dame's self answer, she who could,\nWith that fine candour only forthcoming\nWhen 'tis no odds whether withheld or no--\n\"Because my husband was the saint you say,\n\"And,--with that childish goodness, absurd faith,\n\"Stupid self-satisfaction, you so praise,--\n\"Saint to you, insupportable to me.\n\"Had he,--instead of calling me fine names,\n\"Lucretia and Susanna and so forth,\n\"And curtaining Correggio carefully\n\"Lest I be taught that Leda had two legs,--\n\"--But once never so little tweaked my nose\n\"For peeping through my fan at Carnival,\n\"Confessing thereby 'I have no easy task--\n\"'I need use all my powers to hold you mine,\n\"'And then,--why 'tis so doubtful if they serve,\n\"'That--take this, as an earnest of despair!'\n\"Why, we were quits--I had wiped the harm away,\n\"Thought 'The man fears me!' and foregone revenge.\"\nWe must not want all this elaborate work\nTo solve the problem why young fancy-and-flesh\nSlips from the dull side of a spouse in years,\nBetakes it to the breast of brisk-and-bold\nWhose love-scrapes furnish talk for all the town!\n\nAccordingly, one word on the other side\nTips over the piled-up fabric of a tale.\nGuido says--that is, always, his friends say--\nIt is unlikely from the wickedness,\nThat any man treat any woman so.\nThe letter in question was her very own,\nUnprompted and unaided: she could write--\nAs able to write as ready to sin, or free,\nWhen there was danger, to deny both facts.\nHe bids you mark, herself from first to last\nAttributes all the so-styled torture just\nTo jealousy,--jealousy of whom but just\nThis very Caponsacchi! How suits here\nThis with the other alleged motive, Prince?\nWould Guido make a terror of the man\nHe meant should tempt the woman, as they charge?\nDo you fright your hare that you may catch your hare?\nConsider too the charge was made and met\nAt the proper time and place where proofs were plain--\nHeard patiently and disposed of thoroughly\nBy the highest powers, possessors of most light,\nThe Governor, for the law, and the Archbishop\nFor the Gospel: which acknowledged primacies,\n'Tis impudently pleaded, he could warp\nInto a tacit partnership with crime--\nHe being the while, believe their own account,\nImpotent, penniless and miserable!\nHe further asks--Duke, note the knotty point!--\nHow he,--concede him skill to play such part\nAnd drive his wife into a gallant's arms,--\nCould bring the gallant to play his part too\nAnd stand with arms so opportunely wide?\nHow bring this Caponsacchi,--with whom, friends\nAnd foes alike agree, throughout his life\nHe never interchanged a civil word\nNor lifted courteous cap to--how bend him,\nTo such observancy of beck and call,\n--To undertake this strange and perilous feat\nFor the good of Guido, using, as the lure,\nPompilia whom, himself and she avouch,\nHe had nor spoken with nor seen, indeed,\nBeyond sight in a public theatre,\nWhen she wrote letters (she that could not write!)\nThe importunate shamelessly-protested love\nWhich brought him, though reluctant, to her feet,\nAnd forced on him the plunge which, howsoe'er\nShe might swim up i' the whirl, must bury him\nUnder abysmal black: a priest contrive\nNo mitigable amour to 'e hushed up,\nBut open flight and noon-day infamy?\nTry and concoct defence for such revolt!\nTake the wife's tale as true, say she was wronged,--\nPray, in what rubric of the breviary\nDo you find it registered the part of a priest\nThat to right wrongs he skip from the church-door,\nGo journeying with a woman that's a wife,\nAnd be pursued, o'ertaken, and captured...how?\nIn a lay-dress, playing the sentinel\nWhere the wife sleeps (says he who best should know)\nAnd sleeping, sleepless, both have spent the night!\nCould no one else be found to serve at need--\nNo woman--or if man, no safer sort\nThan this not well-reputed turbulence?\n\nThen, look into his own account o' the case!\nHe, being the stranger and the astonished one,\nYet received protestations of her love\nFrom lady neither known nor cared about:\nLove, so protested, bred in him disgust\nAfter the wonder,--or incredulity,\nSuch impudence seeming impossible.\nBut, soon assured such impudence might be,\nWhen he had seen with his own eyes at last\nLetters thrown down to him i' the very street\nFrom behind lattice where the lady lurked,\nAnd read their passionate summons to her side--\nWhy then, a thousand thoughts swarmed up and in,--\nHow he had seen her once, a moment's space,\nObserved she was so young and beautiful,\nHeard everywhere report she suffered much\nFrom a jealous husband thrice her age,--in short\nThere flashed the propriety, expediency\nOf treating, trying might they come to terms,\n--At all events, granting the interview\nPrayed for, and so adapted to assist\nDecision as to whether he advance,\nStand or retire, in his benevolent mood.\nTherefore the interview befell at length;\nAnd at this one and only interview,\nHe saw the sole and single course to take--\nBade her dispose of him, head, heart, and hand,\nDid her behest and braved the consequence,\nNot for the natural end, the love of man\nFor woman whether love be virtue or vice,\nBut, please you, altogether for pity's sake--\nPity of innocence and helplessness!\nAnd how did he assure himself of both?\nHad he been the house-inmate, visitor,\nEye-witness of the described martyrdom\nSo, competent to pronounce its remedy\nEre rush on such extreme and desperate course,\nInvolving such enormity of harm,\nMoreover, to the husband judged thus, doomed\nAnd damned without a word in his defence?\nBut no,--the truth was felt by instinct here!\n--Process which saves a world of trouble and time,\nAnd there's his story: what do you say to it,\nTrying its truth by your own instinct too,\nSince that's to be the expeditious mode?\n\"And now, do hear my version,\" Guido cries:\n\"I accept argument and inference both.\n\"It would indeed have been miraculous\n\"Had such a confidency sprung to birth\n\"With no more fanning from acquaintanceship\n\"Than here avowed by my wife and this priest.\n\"Only, it did not: you must substitute\n\"The old stale unromantic way of fault,\n\"The commonplace adventure, mere intrigue\n\"In the prose form with the unpoetic tricks,\n\"Cheatings and lies: they used the hackney chair\n\"Satan jaunts forth with, shabby and serviceable,\n\"No gilded jimcrack-novelty from below,\n\"To bowl you along thither, swift and sure.\n\"That same officious go-between, the wench\n\"That gave and took the letters of the two,\n\"Now offers self and service back to me:\n\"Bears testimony to visits night by night\n\"When all was safe, the husband far and away,--\n\"To many a timely slipping out at large\n\"By light o' the morning-star, ere he should wake,\n\"And when the fugitives were found at last,\n\"Why, with them were found also, to belie\n\"What protest they might make of innocence,\n\"All documents yet wanting, if need were,\n\"To establish guilt in them, disgrace in me--\n\"The chronicle o' the converse from its rise\n\"To culmination in this outrage: read!\n\"Letters from wife to priest, from priest to wife,--\n\"Here they are, read and say where they chime in\n\"With the other tale, superlative purity\n\"O' the pair of saints! I stand or fall by these.\"\n\nBut then on the other side again,--how say\nThe pair of saints? That not one word is theirs--\nNo syllable o' the batch or writ or sent\nOr yet received by either of the two.\n\"Found,\" says the priest, \"because he needed them,\n\"Failing all other proofs, to prove our fault:\n\"So, here they are, just as is natural.\n\"Oh yes--we had our missives, each of us!\n\"Not these, but to the full as vile, no doubt:\n\"Hers as from me,--she could not read, so burnt,--\n\"Mine as from her,--I burnt because I read.\n\"Who forged and found them? Cui profuerint!\"\n(I take the phrase out of your Highness' mouth)\n\"He who would gain by her fault and my fall,\n\"The trickster, schemer, and pretender--he\n\"Whose whole career was lie entailing lie\n\"Sought to be sealed truth by the worst lie last!\"\n\nGuido rejoins--\"Did the other end o' the tale\n\"Match this beginning! 'Tis alleged I prove\n\"A murderer at the end, a man of force\n\"Prompt, indiscriminate, effectual: good!\n\"Then what need all this trifling woman's work,\n\"Letters and embassies and weak intrigue,\n\"When will and power were mine to end at once\n\"Safely and surely? Murder had come first\n\"Not last with such a man, assure yourselves!\n\"The silent acquetta, stilling at command--\n\"A drop a day i' the wine or soup, the dose,--\n\"The shattering beam that breaks above the bed\n\"And beats out brains, with nobody to blame\n\"Except the wormy age which eats even oak,--\n\"Nay, the staunch steel or trusty cord,--who cares\n\"I' the blind old palace, a pitfall at each step,\n\"With none to see, much more to interpose\n\"O' the two, three creeping house-dog-servant-things\n\"Born mine and bred mine?--had I willed gross death,\n\"I had found nearer paths to thrust him prey\n\"Than this that goes meandering here and there\n\"Through half the world and calls down in its course\n\"Notice and noise,--hate, vengeance, should it fail,\n\"Derision and contempt though it succeed!\n\"Moreover, what o' the future son and heir?\n\"The unborn babe about to be called mine,--\n\"What end in heaping all this shame on him,\n\"Were I indifferent to my own black share?\n\"Would I have tried these crookednesses, say,\n\"Willing and able to effect the straight?\"\n\n\"Ay, would you!\"--one may hear the priest retort,\n\"Being as you are, i' the stock, a man of guile,\n\"And ruffianism but an added graft.\n\"You, a born coward, try a coward's arms,\n\"Trick and chicane,--and only when these fail\n\"Does violence follow, and like fox you bite\n\"Caught out in stealing. Also, the disgrace\n\"You hardly shrunk at, wholly shrivelled her:\n\"You plunged her thin white delicate hand i' the flame\n\"Along with your coarse horny brutish fist,\n\"Held them a second there, then drew out both\n\"--Yours roughed a little, hers ruined through and through.\n\"Your hurt would heal forthwith at ointment's touch--\n\"Namely, succession to the inheritance\n\"Which bolder crime had lost you: let things change,\n\"The birth o' the boy warrant the bolder crime,\n\"Why, murder was determined, dared, and done.\n\"For me,\" the priest proceeds with his reply,\n\"The look o' the thing, the chances of mistake,\n\"All were against me,--that, I knew the first:\n\"But, knowing also what my duty was,\n\"I did it: I must look to men more skilled\n\"I' the reading hearts than ever was the world.\"\n\nHighness, decide! Pronounce, Her Excellency!\nOr...even leave this argument in doubt,\nAccount it a fit matter, taken up\nWith all its faces, manifold enough,\nTo put upon--what fronts us, the next stage.\nNext legal process!--Guido, in pursuit,\nComing up with the fugitives at the inn,\nCaused both to be arrested then and there\nAnd sent to Rome for judgment on the case--\nThither, with all his armoury of proofs\nBetook himself, and there we'll meet him now,\nWaiting the further issue.\n\nHere some smile\n\"And never let him henceforth dare to plead,--\n\"Of all pleas and excuses in the world\n\"For any deed hereafter to be done,--\n\"His irrepressible wrath at honour's wound!\n\"Passion and madness irrepressible?\n\"Why, Count and cavalier, the husband comes\n\"And catches foe i' the very act of shame:\n\"There's man to man,--nature must have her way,--\n\"We look he should have cleared things on the spot.\n\"Yes, then, indeed--even tho' it prove he erred--\n\"Though the ambiguous first appearance, mount\n\"Of solid injury, melt soon to mist,\n\"Still,--had he slain the lover and the wife--\n\"Or, since she was a woman and his wife,\n\"Slain him, but stript her naked to the skin\n\"Or at best left no more of an attire\n\"Than patch sufficient to pin paper to,\n\"Some one love-letter, infamy and all,\n\"As passport to the Paphos fit for such,\n\"Safe-conduct to her natural home the stews,--\n\"Good!

Settled or disturbed,\nConsole yourselves: 'tis like...an instance, now!\nYou've seen the puppets, of Place Navona, play,--\nPunch and his mate,--how threats pass, blows are dealt,\nAnd a crisis comes: the crowd or clap or hiss\nAccordingly as disposed for man or wife--\nWhen down the actors duck awhile perdue,\nDonning what novel rag-and-feather trim\nBest suits the next adventure, new effect:\nAnd,--by the time the mob is on the move,\nWith something like a judgment pro and con,--\nThere's a whistle, up again the actors pop\nIn t'other tatter with fresh-tinseled staves,\nTo re-engage in one last worst fight more\nShall show, what you thought tragedy was farce.\nNote, that the climax and the crown of things\nInvariably is, the devil appears himself,\nArmed and accoutred, horns and hoofs and tail!\nJust so, nor otherwise it proved--you'll see:\nMove to the murder, never mind the rest!\n\nGuido, at such a general duck-down,\nI' the breathing-space,--of wife to convent here,\nPriest to his relegation, and himself\nTo Arezzo,--had resigned his part perforce\nTo brother Abate, who bustled, did his best,\nRetrieved things somewhat, managed the three suits--\nSince, it should seem, there were three suits-at-law\nBehoved him look to, still, lest bad grow worse:\nFirst civil suit,--the one the parents brought,\nImpugning the legitimacy of his wife,\nAffirming thence the nullity of her rights:\nThis was before the Rota,--Molines,\nThat's judge there, made that notable decree\nWhich partly leaned to Guido, as I said,--\nBut Pietro had appealed against the same\nTo the very court will judge what we judge now--\nTommati and his fellows,--Suit the first.\nNext civil suit,--demand on the wife's part\nOf separation from the husband's bed\nOn plea of cruelty and risk to life--\nClaims restitution of the dowry paid,\nImmunity from paying any more:\nThis second, the Vicegerent has to judge.\nThird and last suit,--this time, a criminal one,--\nAnswer to, and protection from, both these,--\nGuido's complaint of guilt against his wife\nIn the Tribunal of the Governor,\nVenturini, also judge of the present cause.\nThree suits of all importance plaguing him,\nBeside a little private enterprise\nOf Guido's,--essay at a shorter cut.\nFor Paolo, knowing the right way at Rome,\nHad, even while superintending these three suits\nI' the regular way, each at its proper court,\nIngeniously made interest with the Pope\nTo set such tedious regular forms aside,\nAnd, acting the supreme and ultimate judge,\nDeclare for the husband and against the wife.\nWell, at such crisis and extreme of straits,\nThe man at bay, buffeted in this wise,\nHappened the strangest accident of all.\n\"Then,\" sigh friends, \"the last feather broke his back,\n\"Made him forget all possible remedies\n\"Save one--he rushed to, as the sole relief\n\"From horror and the abominable thing.\"\n\"Or rather,\" laugh foes, \"then did there befall\n\"The luckiest of conceivable events,\n\"Most pregnant with impunity for him,\n\"Which henceforth turned the flank of all attack,\n\"And bade him do his wickedest and worst.\"\n--The wife's withdrawal from the Convertites,\nVisit to the villa where her parents lived,\nAnd birth there of his babe. Divergence here!\nI simply take the facts, ask what they show.\n\nFirst comes this thunderclap of a surprise:\nThen follow all the signs and silences\nPremonitory of earthquake. Paolo first\nVanished, was swept off somewhere, lost to Rome:\n(Wells dry up, while the sky is sunny and blue.)\nThen Guido girds himself for enterprise,\nHies to Vittiano, counsels with his steward,\nComes to terms with four peasants young and bold,\nAnd starts for Rome the Holy, reaches her\nAt very holiest, for 'tis Christmas Eve,\nAnd makes straight for the Abate's dried-up font,\nThe lodge where Paolo ceased to work the pipes.\nAnd then, rest taken, observation made\nAnd plan completed, all in a grim week,\nThe five proceed in a body, reach the place,\n--Pietro's, by the Paolina, silent, lone,\nAnd stupefied by the propitious snow,--\nAt one in the evening: knock: a voice \"Who's there?\"\n\"Friends with a letter from the priest your friend.\"\nAt the door, straight smiles old Violante's self.\nShe falls,--her son-in-law stabs through and through,\nReaches thro' her at Pietro--\"With your son\n\"This is the way to settle suits, good sire!\"\nHe bellows \"Mercy for heaven, not for earth!\n\"Leave to confess and save my sinful soul,\n\"Then do your pleasure on the body of me!\"\n--\"Nay, father, soul with body must take its chance!\"\nHe presently got his portion and lay still.\nAnd last, Pompilia rushes here and there\nLike a dove among lightnings in her brake,\nFalls also: Guido's, this last husband's-act.\nHe lifts her by the long dishevelled hair,\nHolds her away at arms' length with one hand,\nWhile the other tries if life come from the mouth--\nLooks out his whole heart's hate on the shut eyes,\nDraws a deep satisfied breath, \"So--dead at last!\"\nThrows down the burthen on dead Pietro's knees,\nAnd ends all with \"Let us away, my boys!\"\n\nAnd, as they left by one door, in at the other\nTumbled the neighbours--for the shrieks had pierced\nTo the mill and the grange, this cottage and that shed.\nSoon followed the Public Force: pursuit began\nThough Guido had the start and chose the road:\nSo, that same night was he, with the other four,\nOvertaken near Baccano,--where they sank\nBy the way-side, in some shelter meant for beasts,\nAnd now lay heaped together, nuzzling swine,\nEach wrapped in bloody cloak, each grasping still\nHis unwiped weapon, sleeping all the same\nThe sleep o' the just,--a journey of twenty miles\nBringing just and unjust to a level, you see.\nThe only one i' the world that suffered aught\nBy the whole night's toil and trouble, flight and chase,\nWas just the officer who took them, Head\nO' the Public Force,--Patrizj, zealous soul,\nWho, having duty to sustain the flesh,\nGot heated, caught a fever and so died:\nA warning to the over-vigilant,\n--Virtue in a chafe should change her linen quick,\nLest pleurisy get start of providence.\n(That's for the Cardinal, and told, I think!)\nWell, they bring back the company to Rome.\nSays Guido, \"By your leave, I fain would ask\n\"How you found out 'twas I who did the deed?\n\"What put you on my trace, a foreigner,\n\"Supposed in Arezzo,--and assuredly safe\n\"Except for an oversight: who told you, pray?\"\n\"Why, naturally your wife!\" Down Guido drops\nO' the horse he rode,--they have to steady and stay,\nAt either side the brute that bore him, bound,\nSo strange it seemed his wife should live and speak!\nShe had prayed--at least so people tell you now--\nFor but one thing to the Virgin for herself,\nNot simply, as did Pietro 'mid the stabs,--\nTime to confess and get her own soul saved--\nBut time to make the truth apparent, truth\nFor God's sake, lest men should believe a lie:\nWhich seems to have been about the single prayer\nShe ever put up, that was granted her.\nWith this hope in her head, of telling truth,--\nBeing familiarised with pain, beside,--\nShe bore the stabbing to a certain pitch\nWithout a useless cry, was flung for dead\nOn Pietro's lap, and so attained her point.\nHer friends subjoin this--have I done with them?--\nAnd cite the miracle of continued life\n(She was not dead when I arrived just now)\nAs attestation to her probity.\n\nDoes it strike your Excellency? Why, your Highness,\nThe self-command and even the final prayer,\nOur candour must acknowledge explainable\nAs easily by the consciousness of guilt.\nSo, when they add that her confession runs\nShe was of wifehood one white innocence\nIn thought, word, act, from first of her short life\nTo last of it; praying i' the face of death,\nThat God forgive her other sins--not this\nShe is charged with and must die for, that she failed\nAnyway to her husband: while thereon\nComments the old Religious--\"So much good,\n\"Patience beneath enormity of ill,\n\"I hear to my confusion, woe is me,\n\"Sinner that I stand, shamed in the walk and gait\n\"I have practised and grown old in, by a child!\"--\nGuido's friends shrug the shoulder, \"Just this same\n\"Prodigious absolute calm in the last hour\n\"Confirms us,--being the natural result\n\"Of a life which proves consistent to the close.\n\"Having braved heaven and deceived earth throughout,\n\"She braves still and deceives still, gains thereby\n\"Two ends, she prizes beyond earth or heaven:\n\"First sets her lover free, imperilled sore\n\"By the new turn things take: he answers yet\n\"For the part he played: they have summoned him indeed:\n\"The past ripped up, he may be punished still:\n\"What better way of saving him than this?\n\"Then,--thus she dies revenged to the uttermost\n\"On Guido, drags him with her in the dark,\n\"The lower still the better, do you doubt?\n\"Thus, two ways, does she love her love to the end,\n\"And hate her hate,--death, hell is no such price\n\"To pay for these,--lovers and haters hold.\"\nBut there's another parry for the thrust.\n\"Confession,\" cry folks--\"a confession, think!\n\"Confession of the moribund is true!\"\nWhich of them, my wise friends? This public one,\nOr the private other we shall never know?\nThe private may contain,--your casuists teach,--\nThe acknowledgment of, and the penitence for,\nThat other public one, so people say.\nHowever it be,--we trench on delicate ground,\nHer Eminence is peeping o'er the cards,--\nCan one find nothing in behalf of this\nCatastrophe? Deaf folks accuse the dumb!\nYou criticise the drunken reel, fool's-speech,\nManiacal gesture of the man,--we grant!\nBut who poured poison in his cup, we ask?\nRecall the list of his excessive wrongs,\nFirst cheated in his wife, robbed by her kin,\nRendered anon the laughing-stock o' the world\nBy the story, true or false, of his wife's birth,--\nThe last seal publicly apposed to shame\nBy the open flight of wife and priest,--why, Sirs,\nStep out of Rome a furlong, would you know\nWhat anotherguess tribunal than ours here.\nMere worldly Court without the help of grace,\nThinks of just that one incident o' the flight?\nGuido preferred the same complaint before\nThe court of Arezzo, bar of the Granduke,--\nIn virtue of it being Tuscany\nWhere the offence had rise and flight began,--\nSelf-same complaint he made in the sequel here\nWhere the offence grew to the full, the flight\nEnded: offence and flight, one fact judged twice\nBy two distinct tribunals,--what result?\nThere was a sentence passed at the same time\nBy Arezzo and confirmed by the Granduke,\nWhich nothing baulks of swift and sure effect\nBut absence of the guilty (flight to Rome\nFrees them from Tuscan jurisdiction now)\n--Condemns the wife to the opprobrious doom\nOf all whom law just lets escape from death.\nThe Stinche, House of Punishment, for life,--\nThat's what the wife deserves in Tuscany:\nHere, she deserves--remitting with a smile\nTo her father's house, main object of the flight!\nThe thief presented with the thing he steals!\n\nAt this discrepancy of judgments--mad,\nThe man took on himself the office, judged;\nAnd the only argument against the use\nO' the law he thus took into his own hands\nIs...what, I ask you?--that, revenging wrong,\nHe did not revenge sooner, kill at first\nWhom he killed last! That is the final charge.\nSooner? What's soon or late i' the case?--ask we.\nA wound i' the flesh no doubt wants prompt redress;\nIt smarts a little to-day, well in a week,\nForgotten in a month; or never, or now, revenge!\nBut a wound to the soul? That rankles worse and worse.\nShall I comfort you, explaining--\"Not this once\n\"But now it may be some five hundred times\n\"I called you ruffian, pandar, liar, and rogue:\n\"The injury must be less by lapse of time?\"\nThe wrong is a wrong, one and immortal too,\nAnd that you bore it those five hundred times,\nLet it rankle unrevenged five hundred years,\nIs just five hundred wrongs the more and worse!\nMen, plagued this fashion, get to explode this way,\nIf left no other.\n\n\"But we left this man\n\"Many another way, and there's his fault,\"\n'Tis answered--\"He himself preferred our arm\n\"O' the law to fight his battle with. No doubt\n\"We did not open him an armoury\n\"To pick and choose from, use, and then reject.\n\"He tries one weapon and fails,--he tries the next\n\"And next: he flourishes wit and common sense,\n\"They fail him,--he plies logic doughtily,\n\"It fails him too,--thereon, discovers last\n\"He has been blind to the combustibles--\n\"That all the while he is a-glow with ire,\n\"Boiling with irrepressible rage, and so\n\"May try explosives and discard cold steel,--\n\"So hire assassins, plot, plan, execute!\n\"Is this the honest self-forgetting rage\n\"We are called to pardon? Does the furious bull\n\"Pick out four helpmates from the grazing herd\n\"And journey with them over hill and dale\n\"Till he find his enemy?\"\n\nWhat rejoinder? save\nThat friends accept our bull-similitude.\nBull-like,--the indiscriminate slaughter, rude\nAnd reckless aggravation of revenge,\nWere all i'the way o' the brute who never once\nCeases, amid all provocation more,\nTo bear in mind the first tormentor, first\nGiver o' the wound that goaded him to fight:\nAnd, though a dozen follow and reinforce\nThe aggressor, wound in front and wound in flank,\nContinues undisturbedly pursuit,\nAnd only after prostrating his prize\nTurns on the pettier, makes a general prey.\nSo Guido rushed against Violante, first\nAuthor of all his wrongs, fons et origo\nMalorum--increasingly drunk,--which justice done?\nHe finished with the rest. Do you blame a bull?\n\nIn truth you look as puzzled as ere I preached!\nHow is that? There are difficulties perhaps\nOn any supposition, and either side.\nEach party wants too much, claims sympathy\nFor its object of compassion, more than just.\nCry the wife's friends, \"O the enormous crime\n\"Caused by no provocation in the world!\"\n\"Was not the wife a little weak?\"--inquire--\n\"Punished extravagantly, if you please,\n\"But meriting a little punishment?\n\"One treated inconsiderately, say,\n\"Rather than one deserving not at all\n\"Treatment and discipline o' the harsher sort?\"\nNo, they must have her purity itself,\nQuite angel--and her parents angels too\nOf an aged sort, immaculate, word and deed,\nAt all events, so seeming, till the fiend,\nEven Guido, by his folly, forced from them\nThe untoward avowal of the trick o' the birth,\nWould otherwise be safe and secret now.\nWhy, here you have the awfulest of crimes\nFor nothing! Hell broke loose on a butterfly!\nA dragon born of rose-dew and the moon!\nYet here is the monster! Why, he's a mere man--\nBorn, bred, and brought up in the usual way.\nHis mother loves him, still his brothers stick\nTo the good fellow of the boyish games;\nThe Governor of his town knows and approves,\nThe Archbishop of the place knows and assists:\nHere he has Cardinal This to vouch for the past,\nCardinal That to trust for the future,--match\nAnd marriage were a Cardinal's making,--in short,\nWhat if a tragedy be acted here\nImpossible for malice to improve,\nAnd innocent Guido with his innocent four\nBe added, all five, to the guilty three,\nThat we of these last days be edified\nWith one full taste o' the justice of the world?\n\nThe long and the short is, truth is what I show:--\nUndoubtedly no pains ought to be spared\nTo give the mob an inkling of our lights.\nIt seems unduly harsh to put the man\nTo the torture, as I hear the court intends,\nThough readiest way of twisting out the truth;\nHe is noble, and he may be innocent:\nOn the other hand, if they exempt the man\n(As it is also said they hesitate\nOn the fair ground, presumptive guilt is weak\nI' the case of nobility and privilege),--\nWhat crime that ever was, ever will be,\nDeserves the torture? Then abolish it!\nYou see the reduction ad absurdum, Sirs?\n\nHer Excellency must pronounce, in fine!\nWhat, she prefers going and joining play?\nHer Highness finds it late, intends retire?\nI am of their mind: only, all this talk, talked,\n'Twas not for nothing that we talked, I hope?\nBoth know as much about it, now, at least,\nAs all Rome: no particular thanks, I beg!\n(You'll see, I have not so advanced myself,\nAfter my teaching the two idiots here!)Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1282102", "artist_names": "Rare Earth", "full_title": "What'd I Say

"lyrics": "Song of Myself Lyrics1\nI celebrate myself, and sing myself,\nAnd what I assume you shall assume,\nFor every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.\nI loafe and invite my soul,\nI lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.\nMy tongue, every atom of my blood, form'd from this soil, this air,\nBorn here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same,\nI, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,\nHoping to cease not till death\nCreeds and schools in abeyance,\nRetiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,\nI harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,\nNature without check with original energy.\n2\nHouses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with perfumes,\nI breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,\nThe distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.\nThe atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is odorless,\nIt is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,\nI will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,\nI am mad for it to be in contact with me.\nThe smoke of my own breath,\nEchoes, ripples, buzz'd whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,\nMy respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs,\nThe sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color'd sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,\nThe sound of the belch'd words of my voice loos'd to the eddies of the wind,\nA few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,\nThe play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,\nThe delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides,\nThe feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun.\nHave you reckon'd a thousand acres much? have you reckon'd the earth much?\nHave you practis'd so long to learn to read?\nHave you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?\nStop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,\nYou shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,)\nYou shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,\nYou shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,\nYou shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.\n\n3\n\nI have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the\nBeginning and the end,\nBut I do not talk of the beginning or the end.\nThere was never any more inception than there is now,\nNor any more youth or age than there is now,\nAnd will never be any more perfection than there is now,\nNor any more heaven or hell than there is now.\nUrge and urge and urge,\nAlways the procreant urge of the world.\nOut of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex,\nAlways a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.\nTo elaborate is no avail, learn'd and unlearn'd feel that it is so.\n\nSure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well\nentretied, braced in the beams,\nStout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,\nI and this mystery here we stand.\n\nClear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is\nnot my soul.\nLack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,\nTill that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.\nShowing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,\nKnowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while\nthey discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.\nWelcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man\nhearty and clean,\nNot an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest.\n\nI am satisfied \u2014 I see, dance, laugh, sing;\nAs the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side\nthrough the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day\nwith stealthy tread,\nLeaving me baskets cover'd with white towels swelling the\nhouse with their plenty,\nShall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,\nThat they turn from gazing after and down the road,\nAnd forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,\nExactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and\nwhich is ahead?\n\n4\n\nTrippers and askers surround me,\nPeople I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live in, or the nation,\nThe latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors\nold and new,\nMy dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,\nThe real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,\nThe sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or\nloss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,\nBattles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful\nnews, the fitful events;\nThese come to me days and nights and go from me again,\nBut they are not the Me myself.\nApart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,\nStands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,\nLooks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,\nLooking with side-curved head curious what will come next,\nBoth in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.\nBackward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders,\nI have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.\n\n5\n\nI believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,\nAnd you must not be abased to the other.\nLoafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,\nNot words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture,\nnot even the best,\nOnly the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice.\nI mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,\nHow you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me,\nAnd parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your\ntongue to my bare-stript heart,\nAnd reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held\nmy feet.\nSwiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,\nAnd I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,\nAnd I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,\nAnd that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the\nwomen my sisters and lovers,\n\nAnd that a kelson of the creation is love,\nAnd limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,\nAnd brown ants in the little wells beneath them,\nAnd mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap'd stones, elder,\nmullein and poke-weed.\n\n6\n\nA child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full\nHands,\nHow could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any\nMore than he.\nI guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful\nGreen stuff woven.\nOr I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,\nA scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,\nBearing the owner's name someway in the corners, that we\nMay see and remark, and say Whose?\nOr I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the\nVegetation.\nOr I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,\nAnd it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow\nZones,\nGrowing among black folks as among white,\nKanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the\nSame, I receive them the same.\nAnd now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.\n\nTenderly will I use you curling grass,\nIt may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,\nIt may be if I had known them I would have loved them,\nIt may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken\nSoon out of their mothers' laps,\nAnd here you are the mothers' laps.\nThis grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old\nMothers,\nDarker than the colourless beards of old men,\nDark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.\n\nO I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,\nAnd I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths\nFor nothing.\nI wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men\nAnd women,\nAnd the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring\nTaken soon out of their laps.\nWhat do you think has become of the young and old men?\nAnd what do you think has become of the women and\nChildren?\nThey are alive and well somewhere,\nThe smallest sprout shows there is really no death,\nAnd if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at\nThe end to arrest it,\nAnd ceas'd the moment life appear'd.\n\nAll goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,\nAnd to die is different from what any one supposed, and\nLuckier.\n\n7\n\nHas any one supposed it lucky to be born?\nI hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I\nKnow it.\nI pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash'd\nBabe, and am not contain'd between my hat and boots,\nAnd peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one\nGood,\nThe earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all\nGood.\nI am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,\nI am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal\nAnd fathomless as myself,\n(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)\nEvery kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and\nFemale,\nFor me those that have been boys and that love women,\nFor me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be\nSlighted,\n\nFor me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and\nThe mothers of mothers,\nFor me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,\nFor me children and the begetters of children.\nUndrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,\nI see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,\nAnd am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot\nBe shaken away.\n\n8\n\nThe little one sleeps in its cradle,\nI lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away\nFlies with my hand.\n\nThe youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy\nHill,\nI peeringly view them from the top.\n\nThe suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,\nI witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the\nPistol has fallen.\nThe blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of\nThe promenaders,\nThe heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb,\nThe clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,\nThe snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,\nThe hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous'd mobs,\nThe flap of the curtain'd litter, a sick man inside borne to the\nHospital,\nThe meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,\nThe excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly\nWorking his passage to the centre of the crowd,\nThe impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,\nWhat groans of over-fed or half-starv'd who fall sunstruck or\nIn fits,\nWhat exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry\nHome and give birth to babes,\n\nWhat living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what\nhowls restrain'd by decorum,\nArrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made,\nacceptances, rejections with convex lips,\nI mind them or the show or resonance of them \u2014 I come and I\ndepart.\n\n9\n\nThe big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,\nThe dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn\nwagon,\nThe clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,\nThe armfuls are pack'd to the sagging mow.\nI am there, I help, I came stretch'd atop of the load,\nI felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,\nI jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and\ntimothy,\nAnd roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.\n\n10\n\nAlone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,\nWandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,\nIn the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,\nKindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill'd game,\nFalling asleep on the gather'd leaves with my dog and gun by my side.\n\nThe Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle\nand scud,\nMy eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously\nfrom the deck.\n\nThe boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,\nI tuck'd my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;\nYou should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.\n\nI saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far\nwest, the bride was a red girl,\nHer father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders,\nOn a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,\nShe had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach'd to her feet.\n\nThe runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,\nI heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,\nThrough the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,\nAnd went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,\nAnd brought water and fill'd a tub for his sweated body and\nbruis'd feet,\nAnd gave him a room that enter'd from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,\nAnd remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,\nAnd remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\nHe staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass'd north,\nI had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean'd in the corner.\n\n11\n\nTwenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,\nTwenty-eight young men and all so friendly;\nTwenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.\nShe owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,\nShe hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the\nwindow.\nWhich of the young men does she like the best?\nAh the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.\n\nWhere are you off to, lady? for I see you,\nYou splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.\n\nDancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,\nThe rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.\n\nThe beards of the young men glisten'd with wet, it ran from\ntheir long hair,\nLittle streams pass'd all over their bodies.\n\nAn unseen hand also pass'd over their bodies,\nIt descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\n\nThe young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge\nto the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,\nThey do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and\nbending arch,\nThey do not think whom they souse with spray.\n\n12\n\nThe butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his\nknife at the stall in the market,\nI loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.\n\nBlacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,\nEach has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great\nheat in the fire.\n\nFrom the cinder-strew'd threshold I follow their movements,\nThe lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive\narms,\nOverhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,\nThey do not hasten, each man hits in his place.\n\n13\n\nThe negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block\nSwags underneath on its tied-over chain,\nThe negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady\nAnd tall he stands pois'd on one leg on the string-piece,\nHis blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens\nOver his hip-band,\nHis glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of\nHis hat away from his forehead,\nThe sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the\nBlack of his polish'd and perfect limbs.\n\nI behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not\nStop there,\nI go with the team also.\n\nIn me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well\nAs forward sluing,\nTo niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object\nMissing,\nAbsorbing all to myself and for this song.\n\nOxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade,\nWhat is that you express in your eyes?\nIt seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\n\nMy tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my\nDistant and day-long ramble,\nThey rise together, they slowly circle around.\n\nI believe in those wing'd purposes,\nAnd acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,\nAnd consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,\nAnd do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not\nSomething else,\nAnd the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills\nPretty well to me,\nAnd the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.\n\n14\n\nThe wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,\nYa-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,\nThe pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,\nFind its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.\n\nThe sharp-hoof'd moose of the north, the cat on the housesill,\nThe chickadee, the prairie-dog,\nThe litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,\nThe brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread\nWings,\nI see in them and myself the same old law.\n\nThe press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred\nAffections,\nThey scorn the best I can do to relate them.\n\nI am enamour'd of growing out-doors,\nOf men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,\nOf the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes\nAnd mauls, and the drivers of horses,\nI can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.\n\nWhat is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,\nMe going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,\nAdorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take\nMe,\nNot asking the sky to come down to my good will,\nScattering it freely forever.\n\n15\n\nThe pure contralto sings in the organ loft,\nThe carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane\nWhistles its wild ascending lisp,\nThe married and unmarried children ride home to their\nThanksgiving dinner,\nThe pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong\nArm,\nThe mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon\nAre ready,\n\nThe duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,\nThe deacons are ordain'd with cross'd hands at the altar,\nThe spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big\nWheel,\nThe farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe\nAnd looks at the oats and rye,\nThe lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm'd case,\n(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his\nMother's bedroom;)\nThe jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his\nCase,\nHe turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the\nManuscript;\nThe malform'd limbs are tied to the surgeon's table,\nWhat is removed drops horribly in a pail;\nThe quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard\nNods by the bar-room stove,\nThe machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his\nBeat, the gate-keeper marks who pass,\nThe young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him,\nThough I do not know him;)\nThe half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,\nThe western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean\nOn their rifles, some sit on logs,\nOut from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position,\nLevels his piece;\nThe groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,\nAs the woolly-pates ho in the sugar-field, the overseer views\nThem from his saddle,\nThe bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their\nPartners, the dancers bow to each other,\nThe youth lies awake in the cedar-roof'd garret and harks to\nThe musical rain,\nThe Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,\nThe squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm'd cloth is offering\nMoccasins and bead-bags for sale,\nThe connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with\nHalf-shut eyes bent sideways,\n\nAs the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is\nThrown for the shore-going passengers,\nThe young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister\nWinds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the\nKnots,\nThe one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago\nBorne her first child,\nThe clean-hair'd Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine\nOr in the factory or mill,\nThe paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the\nReporter's lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the signpainter\nIs lettering with blue and gold,\nThe canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts\nAt his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,\nThe conductor beats time for the band and all the performers\nFollow him,\nThe child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,\nThe regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the\nWhite sails sparkle!)\nThe drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray,\nThe pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser\nHiggling about the odd cent;)\nThe bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the\nClock moves slowly,\nThe opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open'd lips,\nThe prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her\nTipsy and pimpled neck,\nThe crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and\nWink to each other,\n(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)\nThe President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the\nGreat Secretaries,\nOn the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with\nTwined arms,\nThe crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in\nThe hold,\nThe Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his\nCattle,\n\nAs the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by\nThe jingling of loose change,\nThe floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the\nRoof, the masons are calling for mortar,\nIn single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the\nLaborers;\nSeasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is\nGather'd, it is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes\nOf cannon and small arms!)\nSeasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the\nMower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground;\nOff on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole\nIn the frozen surface,\nThe stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter\nStrikes deep with his axe,\nFlatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood\nOr pecan-trees,\nCoon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through\nThose drain'd by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas,\nTorches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or\nAltamahaw,\nPatriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and\nGreat-grandsons around them,\nIn walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers\nAfter their day's sport,\nThe city sleeps and the country sleeps,\nThe living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,\nThe old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband\nSleeps by his wife;\nAnd these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,\nAnd such as it is to be of these more or less I am,\nAnd of these one and all I weave the song of myself.\n\n16\n\nI am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,\nRegardless of others, ever regardful of others,\nMaternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,\nStuff'd with the stuff that is coarse and stuff'd with the stuff\nThat is fine,\nOne of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same\nAnd the largest the same,\nA Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant\nAnd hospitable down by the Oconee I live,\nA Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the\nLimberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,\nA Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin\nLeggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,\nA boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier,\nBadger, Buck-eye;\nAt home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with\nFishermen off Newfoundland,\nAt home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and\nTacking,\nAt home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine,\nOr the Texan ranch,\nComrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners,\n(loving their big proportions,)\nComrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake\nHands and welcome to drink and meat,\nA learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,\nA novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,\nOf every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,\nA farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,\nPrisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.\nI resist any thing better than my own diversity,\nBreathe the air but leave plenty after me,\nAnd am not stuck up, and am in my place.\n(The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place,\nThe bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in\nTheir place,\nThe palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)\n\n17\n\nThese are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands,\nThey are not original with me,\nIf they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or\nNext to nothing,\nIf they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they\nAre nothing,\nIf they are not just as close as they are distant they are\nNothing.\nThis is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the\nWater is,\nThis the common air that bathes the globe.\n18\nWith music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,\nI play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches\nFor conquer'd and slain persons.\nHave you heard that it was good to gain the day?\nI also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in\nWhich they are won.\nI beat and pound for the dead,\nI blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for\nThem.\nVivas to those who have fail'd!\nAnd to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!\nAnd to those themselves who sank in the sea!\nAnd to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome\nHeroes!\nAnd the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest\nHeroes known!\n\n19\n\nThis is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,\nIt is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, I make\nAppointments with all,\nI will not have a single person slighted or left away,\nThe kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,\nThe heavy-lipp'd slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;\nThere shall be no difference between them and the rest.\nThis is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of\nHair,\n\nThis the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,\nThis the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,\nThis the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.\n\nDo you guess I have some intricate purpose?\nWell I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica\nOn the side of a rock has.\nDo you take it I would astonish?\nDoes the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering\nThrough the woods?\nDo I astonish more than they?\nThis hour I tell things in confidence,\nI might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.\n\n20\n\nWho goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;\nHow is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?\nWhat is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?\nAll I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,\nElse it were time lost listening to me.\nI do not snivel that snivel the world over,\nThat months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.\nWhimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids,\nConformity goes to the fourth-remov'd,\nI wear my hat as I please indoors or out.\nWhy should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?\nHaving pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel'd\nWith doctors and calculated close,\nI find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.\nIn all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,\nAnd the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.\nI know I am solid and sound,\nTo me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,\nAll are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.\nI know I am deathless,\nI know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter's compass,\nI know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut with a burnt\nStick at night.\n\nI know I am august,\nI do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,\nI see that the elementary laws never apologize,\n(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house\nBy, after all.)\n\nI exist as I am, that is enough,\nIf no other in the world be aware I sit content,\nAnd if each and all be aware I sit content.\n\nOne world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is\nMyself,\nAnd whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or\nTen million years,\nI can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can\nWait.\n\nMy foothold is tenon'd and mortis'd in granite,\nI laugh at what you call dissolution,\nAnd I know the amplitude of time.\n\n21\n\nI am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,\nThe pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are\nWith me,\nThe first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I\nTranslate into a new tongue.\nI am the poet of the woman the same as the man,\nAnd I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,\nAnd I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.\n\nI chant the chant of dilation or pride,\nWe have had ducking and deprecating about enough,\nI show that size is only development.\n\nHave you outstript the rest? are you the President?\nIt is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and\nStill pass on.\n\nI am he that walks with the tender and growing night,\nI call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.\n\nPress close bare-bosom'd night \u2014 press close magnetic\nNourishing night!\nNight of south winds \u2014 night of the large few stars!\nStill nodding night \u2014 mad naked summer night.\n\nSmile O voluptuous cool-breath'd earth!\nEarth of the slumbering and liquid trees!\nEarth of departed sunset \u2014 earth of the mountains misty-topt!\nEarth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!\nEarth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!\nEarth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!\nFar-swooping elbow'd earth \u2014 rich apple-blossom'd earth!\nSmile, for your lover comes.\n\nProdigal, you have given me love \u2014 therefore I to you give\nLove!\nO unspeakable passionate love.\n\n22\n\nYou sea! I resign myself to you also \u2014 I guess what you mean,\nI behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers,\nI believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,\nWe must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of\nSight of the land,\nCushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,\nDash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.\n\nSea of stretch'd ground-swells,\nSea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,\nSea of the brine of life and of unshovell'd yet always-ready\nGraves,\nHowler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,\nI am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.\n\nPartaker of influx and efflux, I, extoller of hate and conciliation,\nExtoller of amies and those that sleep in each others' arms.\n\nI am he attesting sympathy,\n(Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house\nThat supports them?)\nI am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the\nPoet of wickedness also.\n\nWhat blurt is this about virtue and about vice?\nEvil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand\nIndifferent,\nMy gait is no fault-finder's or rejecter's gait,\nI moisten the roots of all that has grown.\n\nDid you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?\nDid you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work'd over and\nRectified?\n\nI find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance,\nSoft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,\nThoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.\n\nThis minute that comes to me over the past decillions,\nThere is no better than it and now.\n\nWhat behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not\nSuch a wonder,\nThe wonder is always and always how there can be a mean\nMan or an infidel.\n\n23\n\nEndless unfolding of words of ages!\nAnd mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.\n\nA word of the faith that never balks,\nHere or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time\nAbsolutely.\n\nIt alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,\nThat mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.\n\nI accept Reality and dare not question it,\nMaterialism first and last imbuing.\n\nHurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!\nFetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,\nThis is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a\nGrammar of the old cartouches,\nThese mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown\nSeas,\nThis is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a\nMathematician.\n\nGentlemen, to you the first honors always!\nYour facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,\nI but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.\n\nLess the reminders of properties told my words,\nAnd more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,\nAnd make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor\nmen and women fully equipt,\nAnd beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire.\n\n24\n\nWalt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,\nTurbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding.\n\nNo sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,\nNo more modest than immodest.\n\nUnscrew the locks from the doors!\nUnscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!\n\nWhoever degrades another degrades me,\nAnd whatever is done or said returns at last to me.\n\nThrough me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the\ncurrent and index.\nI speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,\nBy God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.\n\nThrough me many long dumb voices,\nVoices of the interminable generation of prisoners and slaves,\nVoices of the diseas'd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,\nVoices of cycles of preparation and accretion,\nAnd of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff,\nAnd of the rights of them the others are down upon,\nOf the deform'd, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,\nFog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.\n\nThrough me forbidden voices,\nVoices of sexes and lusts, voices veil'd and I remove the veil,\nVoices indecent by me clarified and transfigur'd.\n\nI do not press my fingers across my mouth,\nI keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,\nCopulation is no more rank to me than death is.\n\nI believe in the flesh and the appetites,\nSeeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.\n\nDivine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch'd from,\nThe scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,\nThis head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.\n\nIf I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it,\nTranslucent mould of me it shall be you!\nShaded ledges and rests it shall be you!\nFirm masculine colter it shall be you!\nWhatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!\nYou my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!\nBreast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!\nMy brain it shall be your occult convolutions!\nRoot of wash'd sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!\nMix'd tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!\nTrickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!\nSun so generous it shall be you!\nVapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!\nYou sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!\nWinds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!\nBroad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you!\nHands I have taken, face I have kiss'd, mortal I have ever touch'd, it shall be you.\n\nI dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,\nEach moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,\nI cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of\nMy faintest wish,\nNor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the\nFriendship I take again.\n\nThat I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,\nA morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the\nMetaphysics of books.\n\nTo behold the day-break!\nThe little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,\nThe air tastes good to my palate.\n\nHefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising,\nFreshly exuding,\nScooting obliquely high and low.\n\nSomething I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,\nSeas of bright juice suffuse heaven.\n\nThe earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,\nThe heav'd challenge from the east that moment over my head,\nThe mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!\n\n25\n\nDazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill\nMe,\nIf I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.\nWe also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,\nWe found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the\nDay-break.\nMy voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,\nWith the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes\nOf worlds.\nSpeech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,\nIt provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,\nWalt you contain enough, why don't you let it out then?\nCome now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of\nArticulation,\nDo you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are\nFolded?\nWaiting in gloom, protected by frost,\nThe dirt receding before my prophetical screams,\nI underlying causes to balance them at last,\n\nMy knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the\nMeaning of all things,\nHappiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in\nSearch of this day.)\nMy final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I\nReally am,\nEncompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,\nI crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward\nYou.\nWriting and talk do not prove me,\nI carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,\nWith the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.\n\n26\n\nNow I will do nothing but listen,\nTo accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute\nToward it.\n\nI hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of\nFlames, clack of sticks cooking my meals.\nI hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,\nI hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or\nFollowing,\nSounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the\nDay and night,\nTalkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh\nOf work-people at their meals,\nThe angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the\nSick,\nThe judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips\nPronouncing a death-sentence,\nThe heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves,\nThe refrain of the anchor-lifters,\nThe ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of\nSwift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory\nTinkles and color'd lights,\nThe steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching\nCars,\n\nThe slow march play'd at the head of the association marching\nTwo and two,\n(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with\nBlack muslin.)\n\nI hear the violoncello, ('tis the young man's heart's complaint,)\nI hear the key'd cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,\nIt shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.\n\nI hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,\nAh this indeed is music \u2014 this suits me.\n\nA tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,\nThe orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.\n\nI hear the train'd soprano (what work with hers is this?)\nThe orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,\nIt wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess'd\nThem,\nIt sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick'd by the indolent\nWaves,\nI am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,\nSteep'd amid honey'd morphine, my windpipe throttled in\nFakes of death,\nAt length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,\nAnd that we call Being.\n\n27\n\nTo be in any form, what is that?\n(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back\nThither,)\nIf nothing lay more develop'd the quahaug in its callous shell\nWere enough.\n\nMine is no callous shell,\nI have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,\nThey seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.\n\nI merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,\nTo touch my person to some one else's is about as much as I\nCan stand.\n\n28\n\nIs this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,\nFlames and ether making a rush for my veins,\nTreacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,\nMy flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is\nHardly different from myself,\nOn all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,\nStraining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,\nBehaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,\nDepriving me of my best as for a purpose,\nUnbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,\nDeluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and\nPasture-fields,\nImmodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,\nThey bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the\nEdges of me,\nNo consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my\nAnger,\nFetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,\nThen all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.\n\nThe sentries desert every other part of me,\nThey have left me helpless to a red marauder,\nThey all come to the headland to witness and assist against\nMe.\n\nI am given up by traitors,\nI talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the\nGreatest traitor,\nI went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me\nThere.\n\nYou villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in\nIts throat,\nUnclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.\n\n29\n\nBlind loving wrestling touch, sheath'd hooded sharp-tooth'd\nTouch!\nDid it make you ache so, leaving me?\n\nParting track'd by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual\nLoan,\nRich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.\n\nSprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and\nVital,\nLandscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.\n\n30\n\nAll truths wait in all things,\nThey neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,\nThey do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,\nThe insignificant is as big to me as any,\n(What is less or more than a touch?)\n\nLogic and sermons never convince,\nThe damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.\n\n(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,\nOnly what nobody denies is so.)\n\nA minute and a drop of me settle my brain,\nI believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,\nAnd a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,\nAnd a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for\nEach other,\nAnd they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it\nBecomes omnific,\nAnd until one and all shall delight us, and we them.\n\n31\n\nI believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of\nThe stars,\nAnd the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and\nThe egg of the wren,\nAnd the tree-toad is a chef-d'oeuvre for the highest,\nAnd the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,\nAnd the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,\n\nAnd the cow crunching with depress'd head surpasses any\nStatue,\nAnd a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of\nInfidels.\nI find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits,\nGrains, esculent roots,\nAnd am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over,\nAnd have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,\nBut call any thing back again when I desire it.\nIn vain the speeding or shyness,\nIn vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my\nApproach,\nIn vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder'd\nBones,\nIn vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,\nIn vain the ocean setting in hollows and the great monsters\nLying low,\nIn vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,\nIn vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,\nIn vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,\nIn vain the razor-bill'd auk sails far north to Labrador,\nI follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the\nCliff.\n\n32\n\nI think I could turn and live with animals, they're so placid\nAnd self-contain'd,\nI stand and look at them long and long.\nThey do not sweat and whine about their condition,\nThey do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,\nThey do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,\nNot one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of\nOwning things,\nNot one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands\nOf years ago,\nNot one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.\n\nSo they show their relations to me and I accept them,\nThey bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in\nTheir possession.\n\nI wonder where they get those tokens,\nDid I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop\nThem?\n\nMyself moving forward then and now and forever,\nGathering and showing more always and with velocity,\nInfinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,\nNot too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,\nPicking out here one that I love, and now go with him on\nBrotherly terms.\n\nA gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my\nCaresses,\nHead high in the forehead, wide between the ears,\nLimbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,\nEyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly\nMoving.\n\nHis nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,\nHis well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around\nAnd return.\nI but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,\nWhy do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?\nEven as I stand or sit passing faster than you.\n\n33\n\nSpace and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess'd at,\nWhat I guess'd when I loaf'd on the grass,\nWhat I guess'd while I lay alone in my bed,\nAnd again as I walk'd the beach under the paling stars of the\nMorning.\nMy ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,\nI skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,\nI am afoot with my vision.\n\nBy the city's quadrangular houses \u2014 in log huts, camping\nWith lumbermen,\nAlong the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet\nBed,\nWeeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and\nParsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,\nProspecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new\nPurchase,\nScorch'd ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down\nThe shallow river,\nWhere the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where\nThe buck turns furiously at the hunter,\nWhere the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where\nThe otter is feeding on fish,\nWhere the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,\nWhere the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where\nThe beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail;\nOver the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower'd cotton\nPlant, over the rice in its low moist field,\nOver the sharp-peak'd farm house, with its scallop'd scum\nAnd slender shoots from the gutters,\nOver the western persimmon, over the long-leav'd corn, over\nThe delicate blue-flower flax,\nOver the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer\nThere with the rest,\nOver the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the\nBreeze;\nScaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on\nBy low scragged limbs,\nWalking the path worn in the grass and beat through the\nLeaves of the brush,\nWhere the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the\nWheatlot,\nWhere the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great\nGold-bug drops through the dark,\nWhere the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and\nFlows to the meadow,\nWhere cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous\nShuddering of their hides,\n\nWhere the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons\nStraddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons\nFrom the rafters;\nWhere trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its\nCylinders,\nWhere the human heart beats with terrible throes under its\nRibs,\nWhere the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in\nIt myself and looking composedly down,)\nWhere the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat\nHatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,\nWhere the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,\nWhere the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,\nWhere the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,\nWhere the half-burn'd brig is riding on unknown currents,\nWhere shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are\nCorrupting below;\nWhere the dense-starr'd flag is borne at the head of the\nRegiments,\nApproaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,\nUnder Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my\nCountenance,\nUpon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood\nOutside,\nUpon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good\nGame of base-ball,\nAt he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license,\nBull-dances, drinking, laughter,\nAt the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash,\nSucking the juice through a straw,\nAt apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,\nAt musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings,\nHouse-raisings;\nWhere the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles,\nScreams, weeps,\nWhere the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks\nAre scatter'd, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,\n\nWhere the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the\nStud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,\nWhere the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with\nShort jerks,\nWhere sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and\nLonesome prairie,\nWhere herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square\nMiles far and near,\nWhere the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the\nLong-lived swan is curving and winding,\nWhere the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs\nHer near-human laugh,\nWhere bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid\nBy the high weeds,\nWhere band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground\nWith their heads out,\nWhere burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a cemetery,\nWhere winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled\nTrees,\nWhere the yellow-crown'd heron comes to the edge of the\nMarsh at night and feeds upon small crabs,\nWhere the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm\nNoon,\nWhere the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the\nWalnut-tree over the wall,\nThrough patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired\nLeaves,\nThrough the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,\nThrough the gymnasium, through the curtain'd saloon,\nThrough the office or public hall;\nPleas'd with the native and pleas'd with the foreign, pleas'd\nWith the new and old,\nPleas'd with the homely woman as well as the handsome,\nPleas'd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and\nTalks melodiously,\nPleas'd with the tune of the choir of the whitewash'd church,\nPleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist\npreacher, impress'd seriously at the camp-meeting;\nLooking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole\nforenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,\n\nWandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up to the\nClouds, or down a lane or along the beach,\nMy right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I\nIn the middle;\nComing home with the silent and dark-cheek'd bush-boy,\n(behind me he rides at the drape of the day,)\nFar from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet,\nOr the moccasin print,\nBy the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish\nPatient,\nNigh the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a\nCandle;\nVoyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,\nHurrying with the modern crowd as eager and flickle as any,\nHot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,\nSolitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from\nMe a long while,\nWalking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God\nBy my side,\nSpeeding through space, speeding through heaven and the\nStars,\nSpeeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and\nThe diameter of eighty thousand miles,\nSpeeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,\nCarrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in\nIts belly,\nStorming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\nBacking and filling, appearing and disappearing,\nI tread day and night such roads.\n\nI visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,\nAnd look at quintillions ripen'd and look at quintillions green.\n\nI fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,\nMy course runs below the soundings of plummets.\n\nI help myself to material and immaterial,\nNo guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.\n\nI anchor my ship for a little while only,\nMy messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns\nTo me.\n\nI go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a\nPike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\n\nI ascend to the foretruck,\nI take my place late at night in the crow's-nest,\nWe sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,\nThrough the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the\nWonderful beauty,\nThe enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the\nScenery is plain in all directions,\nThe white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out\nMy fancies toward them,\nWe are approaching some great battle-field in which we are\nSoon to be engaged,\nWe pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass\nWith still feet and caution,\nOr we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin'd city,\nThe blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living\nCities of the globe.\n\nI am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,\nI turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride\nMyself,\nI tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\n\nMy voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,\nThey fetch my man's body up dripping and drown'd.\n\nI understand the large hearts of heroes,\nThe courage of present times and all times,\nHow the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of\nThe steamship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,\nHow he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful\nOf days and faithful of nights,\nAnd chalk'd in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we\nWill not desert you;\n\nHow he follow'd with them and tack'd with them three days\nAnd would not give it up,\nHow he saved the drifting company at last,\nHow the lank loose-gown'd women look'd when boated\nFrom the side of their prepared graves,\nHow the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the\nSharp-lipp'd unshaved men;\nAll this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,\nI am the man, I suffer'd, I was there.\n\nThe disdain and calmness of martyrs,\nThe mother of old, condemn'd for a witch, burnt with dry\nWood, her children gazing on,\nThe hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence,\nBlowing, cover'd with sweat,\nThe twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the\nMurderous buckshot and the bullets,\nAll these I feel or am.\n\nI am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\nHell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the\nMarksmen,\nI clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the\nOoze of my skin,\nI fall on the weeds and stones,\nThe riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\nTaunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with\nWhip-stocks.\n\nAgonies are one of my changes of garments,\nI do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself\nBecome the wounded person,\nMy hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\n\nI am the mash'd fireman with breast-bone broken,\nTumbling walls buried me in their debris,\nHeat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my\nComrades,\nI heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,\nThey have clear'd the beams away, they tenderly life me forth.\n\nI lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for\nMy sake,\nPainless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,\nWhite and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are\nBared of their fire-caps,\nThe kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\n\nDistant and dead resuscitate,\nThey show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the\nClock myself.\n\nI am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort's bombardment,\nI am there again.\n\nAgain the long roll of the drummers,\nAgain the attacking cannon, mortars,\nAgain to my listeing ears the cannon responsive.\n\nI take part, I see and hear the whole,\nThe cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim'd shots,\nThe ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,\nWorkmen searching after damages, making indispensable\nRepairs,\nThe fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped\nExplosion,\nThe whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\n\nAgain gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously\nWaves with his hand,\nHe gasps through the clot Mind not me \u2014 mind\n\u2014 the entrenchments.\n\n34\n\nNow I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,\n(I tell not the fall of Alamo,\nNot one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\nThe hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)\n'Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and\nTwelve young men.\nRetreating they had form'd in a hollow square with their\nBaggage for breastworks,\nNine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's, nine\nTimes their number, was the price they took in advance,\nTheir colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,\nThey treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv'd writing\nAnd seal, gave up their arms and march'd back prisoners\nOf war.\nThey were the glory of the race of rangers,\nMatchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\nLarge, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and\nAffectionate,\nBearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\nNot a single one over thirty years of age.\nThe second First-day morning they were brought out in\nSquads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer,\nThe work commenced about five o'clock and was over by\nEight.\nNone obey'd the command to kneel,\nSome made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and\nStraight,\nA few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and\nDead lay together,\nThe maim'd and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw\nThem there,\nSome half-kill'd attempted to crawl away,\nThese were despatch'd with bayonets or batter'd with the\nBlunts of muskets.\nA youth not seventeen years old seiz'd his assassin till two\nMore came to release him,\nThe three were all torn and cover'd with the boy's blood.\n\nAt eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies;\nThat is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve\nYoung men.\n\n35\n\nWould you hear of an old-time sea-fight?\nWould you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\nList to the yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it\nTo me.\n\nOur foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)\nHis was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or\nTruer, and never was, and never will be;\nAlong the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us.\n\nWe closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch'd,\nMy captain lash'd fast with his own hands.\n\nWe had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water,\nOn our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first\nFire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.\n\nFighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,\nTen o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the\nGain, and five feet of water reported,\nThe master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the\nAfter-hold to give them a chance for themselves.\n\nThe transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,\nThey see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.\n\nOur frigate takes fire,\nThe other asks if we demand quarter?\nIf our colors are struck and the fighting done?\n\nNow I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,\nWe have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun\nOur part of the fighting.\n\nOnly three guns are in use,\nOne is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's\nMain-mast,\nTwo well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry\nAnd clear his decks.\n\nThe tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially\nThe main-top,\nThey hold out bravely during the whole of the action.\n\nNot a moment's cease,\nThe leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the\nPowder-magazine.\n\nOne of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought\nWe are sinking.\n\nSerene stands the little captain,\nHe is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,\nHis eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.\n\nToward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender\nTo us.\n\n36\n\nStretch'd and still lies the midnight,\nTwo great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,\nOur vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass\nTo the one we have conquer'd,\nThe captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders\nThrough a countenance white as a sheet,\nNear by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin,\nThe dead face of an old salt with long white hair and\nCarefully curl'd whiskers,\nThe flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and\nBelow,\nThe husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,\nFormless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of\nFlesh upon the masts and spars,\nCut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe\nOf waves,\nBlack and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong\nScent,\nA few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,\nDelicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields\nBy the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,\n\nThe hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,\nWheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and\nLong, dull, tapering groan,\nThese so, these irretrievable.\n\n37\n\nYou laggards there on guard! look to your arms!\nIn at the conquer'd doors they crowd! I am possess'd!\nEmbody all presences outlaw'd or suffering,\nSee myself in prison shaped like another man,\nAnd feel the dull unintermitted pain,\nFor me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and\nKeep watch,\nIt is I let out in the morning and barr'd at night.\n\nNot a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but I am handcuff'd\nTo him and walk by his side,\n(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with\nSweat on my twitching lips.)\n\nNot a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am\nTried and sentenced.\n\nNot a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the\nLast gasp,\nMy face is ash-color'd, my sinews gnarl, away from me\nPeople retreat.\n\nAskers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in\nThem,\nI project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.\n\n38\n\nEnough! enough! enough!\nSomehow I have been stunn'd. Stand back!\nGive me a little time beyond my cuff'd head, slumbers,\nDreams, gaping,\nI discover myself on the verse of a usual mistake.\n\nThat I could forget the mockers and insults!\nThat I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the\nBludgeons and hammers!\nThat I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion\nAnd bloody crowning!\n\nI remember now,\nI resume the overstaid fraction,\nThe grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or\nTo any graves,\nCorpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.\n\nI troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an\nAverage unending procession,\nInland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,\nOur swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,\nThe blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of\nYears.\n\nEleves, I salute you! come forward!\nContinue your annotations, continue your questionings.\n\n39\n\nThe friendly and flowing savage, who is he?\nIs he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?\n\nIs he some Southwesterner rais'd out-doors? is he Kanadian?\nIs he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?\nThe mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?\n\nWherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,\nThey desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them,\nStay with them.\n\nBehavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass,\nUncomb'd head, laughter, and naivet\u00e8,\nSlow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and\nEmanations,\nThey descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,\n\nThey are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly\nOut of the glance of his eyes.\n\n40\n\nFlaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask \u2014 lie over!\nYou light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.\n\nEarth! you seem to look for something at my hands,\nSay, old top-knot, what do you want?\n\nMan or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,\nAnd might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,\nAnd might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and\nDays.\n\nBehold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,\nWhen I give I give myself.\n\nYou there, impotent, loose in the knees,\nOpen your scarf'd chops till I blow grit within you,\nSpread your palms and life the flaps of your pockets,\nI am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to\nSpare,\nAnd any thing I have I bestow.\n\nI do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,\nYou can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold\nYou.\n\nTo cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,\nOn his right cheek I put the family kiss,\nAnd in my soul I swear I never will deny him.\n\nOn women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler\nBabes,\n(This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant\nRepublics.)\n\nTo any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the\nDoor,\n\nTurn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,\nLet the physician and the priest go home.\n\nI seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,\nO despairer, here is my neck,\nBy God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight\nUpon me.\n\nI dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,\nEvery room of the house do I fill with an arm'd force,\nLovers of me, bafflers of graves.\n\nSleep \u2014 I and they keep guard all night,\nNot doubt, not disease shall dare to lay finger upon you,\nI have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,\nAnd when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell\nYou is so.\n\n41\n\nI am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,\nAnd for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.\n\nI heard what was said of the universe,\nHeard it and heard it of several thousand years;\nIt is middling well as far as it goes \u2014 but is that all?\n\nMagnifying and applying come I,\nOutbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,\nTaking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,\nLithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,\nBuying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,\nIn my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the\nCrucifix engraved,\nWith Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and\nImage,\nTaking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,\nAdmitting they were alive and did the work of their days,\n(They bore mites as for unfledg'd birds who have now to rise\nAnd fly and sing for themselves,)\n\nAccepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself,\nBestowing them freely on each man and woman I see,\nDiscovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,\nPutting higher claims for him there with his roll'd-up sleeves\nDriving the mallet and chisel,\nNot objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of\nSmoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious\nAs any revelation,\nLads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less\nTo me than the gods of the antique wars,\nMinding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,\nTheir brawny limbs passing safe over charr'd laths, their\nWhite foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;\nBy the mechanic's wife with her babe at her nipple\nInterceding for every person born,\nThree scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty\nAngels with shirts bagg'd out at their waists,\nThe snag-tooth'd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past\nAnd to come,\nSelling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for\nHis brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery;\nWhat was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod\nAbout me, and not filling the square rod then,\nThe bull and the bug never worshipp'd half enough,\nDung and dirt more admirable than was dream'd,\nThe supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to\nBe one of the supremes,\nThe day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good\nAs the best, and be as prodigious;\nBy my life-lumps! becoming already a creator,\nPutting myself here and now to the ambush'd womb of the\nShadows.\n\n42\n\nA call in the midst of the crowd,\nMy own voice, orotund sweeping and final.\n\nCome my children,\nCome my boys and girls, my women, household and\nIntimates,\n\nNow the performer launches his nerve, he has pass'd his\nPrelude on the reeds within.\n\nEasily written loose-finger'd chords \u2014 I feel the thrum of your\nClimax and close.\n\nMy head slues round on my neck,\nMusic rolls, but not from the organ,\nFolks are around me, but they are no household of mine.\n\nEver the hard unsunk ground,\nEver the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward\nSun, ever the air and the ceaseless tides,\nEver myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,\nEver the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn'd thumb,\nThat breath of itches and thirsts,\nEver the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one\nHides and bring him forth,\nEver love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,\nEver the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.\n\nHere and there with dimes on the eyes walking,\nTo feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,\nTickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once\nGoing,\nMany sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for\nPayment receiving,\nA few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.\n\nThis is the city and I am one of the citizens,\nWhatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars,\nMarkets, newspapers, schools,\nThe mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories,\nStocks, stores, real estate and personal estate.\n\nThe little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and\nTail'd coats,\nI am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or\nFleas,)\nI acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and\nShallowest is deathless with me,\n\nWhat I do and say the same waits for them,\nEvery thought that flounders in me the same flounders in\nThem.\n\nI know perfectly well my own egotism,\nKnow my omnivorous lines and must not write any less,\nAnd would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.\n\nNot words of routine this song of mine,\nBut abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;\nThis printed and bound book \u2014 but the printer and the\nPrinting-office boy?\nThe well-taken photographs \u2014 but your wife or friend close\nAnd solid in your arms?\nThe black ship mail'd with iron, her mighty guns in her\nTurrets \u2014 but the pluck of the captain and engineers?\nIn the houses the dishes and fare and furniture \u2014 but the host\nAnd hostess, and the look out of their eyes?\nThe sky up there \u2014 yet here or next door, or across the way?\nThe saints and sages in history \u2014 but you yourself?\nSermons, creeds, theology \u2014 but the fathomless human brain,\nAnd what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?\n\n43\n\nI do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,\nMy faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,\nEnclosing worship ancient and modern and all between\nAncient and modern,\nBelieving I shall come again upon the earth after five\nThousand years,\nWaiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting\nThe sun,\nMaking a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with\nSticks in the circle of obis,\nHelping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,\nDancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt\nAnd austere in the woods a gymnosophist,\nDrinking mead from the skull-cup, to Shastas and Vedas\nAdmirant, minding the Koran,\n\nWalking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and\nKnife, beating the serpent-skin drum,\nAccepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified,\nKnowing assuredly that he is divine,\nTo the mass kneeling or the puritan's prayer rising, or sitting\nPatiently in a pew,\nRanting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like\nTill my spirit arouses me,\nLooking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement\nAnd land,\nBelonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.\n\nOne of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk\nLike a man leaving charges before a journey.\n\nDown-hearted doubters dull and excluded,\nFrivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten'd,\nAtheistical,\nI know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt,\nDespair and unbelief.\n\nHow the flukes splash!\nHow they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts\nOf blood!\n\nBe at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,\nI take my place among you as much as among any,\nThe past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,\nAnd what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all\nPrecisely the same.\n\nI do not know what is untried and afterward,\nBut I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.\n\nEach who passes is consider'd, each who stops is consider'd,\nNot a single one can it fail.\n\nIt cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,\nNor the young woman who died and was put by his side,\nNor the little child that peep'd in at the door, and then drew\nBack and was never seen again,\nNor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it\nWith bitterness worse than gall,\nNor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder,\nNor the numberless slaughter'd and wreck'd, nor the brutish\nKoboo call'd the ordure of humanity,\nNor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to\nSlip in,\nNor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of\nThe earth,\nNor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of\nMyriads that inhabit them,\nNor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.\n\n44\n\nIt is time to explain myself \u2014 let us stand up.\nWhat is known I strip away,\nI launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.\n\nThe clock indicates the moment \u2014 but what does eternity\nIndicate?\n\nWe have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,\nThere are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.\nBirths have brought us richness and variety,\nAnd other births will bring us richness and variety.\n\nI do not call one greater and one smaller,\nThat which fills its period and place is equal to any.\nWere mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother,\nMy sister?\nI am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,\nAll has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,\n(What have I to do with lamentation?)\nI am an acme of things accomplish'd, and I an encloser of\nThings to be.\n\nMy feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,\nOn every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between\nThe steps,\nAll below duly travel'd, and still I mount and mount.\n\nRise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,\nAfar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even\nThere,\nI waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic\nMist,\nAnd took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.\n\nLong I was hugg'd close \u2014 long and long.\n\nImmense have been the preparations for me,\nFaithful and friendly the arms that have help'd me.\n\nCycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful\nBoatmen,\nFor room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,\nThey sent influences to look after what was to hold me.\n\nBefore I was born out of my mother generations guided me,\nMy embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.\n\nFor it the nebula cohered to an orb,\nThe long slow strata piled to rest it on,\nVast vegetables gave it sustenance,\nMonstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited\nIt with care.\n\nAll forces have been steadily employ'd to complete and delight me,\nNow on this spot I stand with my robust soul.\n\n45\n\nO span of youth! ever-push'd elasticity!\nO manhood, balanced, florid and full.\n\nMy lovers suffocate me,\nCrowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,\nJostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to\nMe at night,\nCrying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging\nAnd chirping over my head,\nCalling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,\nLighting on every moment of my life,\nBussing my body with soft balsamic busses,\nNoiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving\nThem to be mine.\n\nOld age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying\nDays!\n\nEvery condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what\nGrows after and out of itself,\nAnd the dark hush promulges as much as any.\n\nI open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,\nAnd all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the\nRim of the farther systems.\n\nWider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,\nOutward and outward and forever outward.\n\nMy sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,\nHe joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,\nAnd greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside\nThem.\n\nThere is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,\nIf I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces,\nWere this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would\nNot avail in the long run,\nWe should surely bring up again where we now stand,\nAnd surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.\n\nA few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues,\nDo not hazard the span or make it impatient,\nThey are but parts, any thing is but a part.\n\nSee ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,\nCount ever so much, there is limitless time around that.\n\nMy rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,\nThe Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,\nThe great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be\nThere.\n\n46\n\nI know I have the best of time and space, and was never\nMeasured and never will be measured.\n\nI tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)\nMy signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut\nFrom the woods,\nNo friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,\nI have no chair, no church, no philosophy,\nI lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,\nBut each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,\nMy left hand hooking you round the waist,\nMy right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the\nPublic road.\n\nNot I, not any one else can travel that road for you,\nYou must travel it for yourself.\n\nIt is not far, it is within reach,\nPerhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not\nKnow,\nPerhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.\n\nShoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us\nHasten forth,\nWonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.\n\nIf you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your\nHand on my hip,\nAnd in due time you shall repay the same service to me,\nFor after we start we never lie by again.\n\nThis day before dawn I ascended a hill and look'd at the\nCrowded heaven,\nAnd I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those\nOrbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in\nThem, shall we be fill'd and satisfied then?\nAnd my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and\nContinue beyond.\n\nYou are also asking me questions and I hear you,\nI answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.\n\nSit a while dear son,\nHere are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,\nBut as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes,\nI kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your\nEgress hence.\n\nLong enough have you dream'd contemptible dreams,\nNow I wash the gum from your eyes,\nYou must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of\nEvery moment of your life.\n\nLong have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,\nNow I will you to be a bold swimmer,\nTo jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me,\nShout, and laughingly dash with your hair.\n\n47\n\nI am the teacher of athletes,\nHe that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves\nThe width of my own,\nHe most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the\nTeacher.\n\nThe boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived\nPower, but in his own right,\nWicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,\nFond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,\nUnrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp\nSteel cuts,\n\nFirst-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye, to sail a skiff,\nTo sing a song or play on the banjo,\nPreferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with\nSmall-pox over all latherers,\nAnd those well-tann'd to those that keep out of the sun.\n\nI teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?\nI follow you whoever you are from the present hour,\nMy words itch at your ears till you understand them.\n\nI do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time\nWhile I wait for a boat,\n(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of\nYou,\nTied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen'd.)\n\nI swear I will never again mention love or death inside a\nHouse,\nAnd I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or\nHer who privately stays with me in the open air.\n\nIf you would understand me go to the heights or\nWater-shore,\nThe nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of\nWaves a key,\nThe maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.\n\nNo shutter'd room or school can commune with me,\nBut roughs and little children better than they.\n\nThe young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,\nThe woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take\nMe with him all day,\nThe farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound\nOf my voice,\nIn vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and\nSeamen and love them.\n\nThe soldier camp'd or upon the march is mine,\nOn the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do\nNot fail them,\n\nOn that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know\nMe seek me.\n\nMy face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies down alone in\nHis blanket,\nThe driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,\nThe young mother and old mother comprehend me,\nThe girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget\nWhere they are,\nThey and all would resume what I have told them.\n\n48\n\nI have said that the soul is not more than the body,\nAnd I have said that the body is not more than the soul,\nAnd nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's self is,\nAnd whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his\nOwn funeral drest in his shroud,\nAnd I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of\nThe earth,\nAnd to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod\nConfounds the learning of all times,\nAnd there is no trade or employment but the young man\nFollowing it may become a hero,\nAnd there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the\nWheel'd universe,\nAnd I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool\nAnd composed before a million universes.\n\nAnd I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,\nFor I who am curious about each am not curious about\nGod,\n(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about\nGod and about death.)\nI hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God\nNot in the least,\nNor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than\nMyself.\nWhy should I wish to see God better than this day?\nI see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and\nEach moment then,\nIn the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own\nFace in the glass,\nI find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is\nSign'd by God's name,\nAnd I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe'er\nI go,\nOthers will punctually come for ever and ever.\n\n49\n\nAnd as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is\nIdle to try to alarm me.\n\nTo his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,\nI see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,\nI recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,\nAnd mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.\n\nAnd as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that\nDoes not offend me,\nI smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,\nI reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish'd breasts of\nMelons.\n\nAnd as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many\nDeaths,\n(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)\n\nI hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,\nO suns \u2014 O grass of graves \u2014 O perpetual transfers and\nPromotions,\nIf you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?\n\nOf the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,\nOf the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing\nTwilight,\nToss, sparkles of day and dusk \u2014 toss on the black stems that\nDecay in the muck,\nToss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.\n\nI ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,\nI perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams\nReflected,\nAnd debouch to the steady and central from the offspring\nGreat or small.\n\n50\n\nThere is that in me \u2014 I do not know what it is \u2014 but I know it\nIs in me.\n\nWrench'd and sweaty \u2014 calm and cool then my body becomes,\nI sleep \u2014 I sleep long.\n\nI do not know it \u2014 it is without name \u2014 it is a word unsaid,\nIt is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.\n\nSomething it swings on more than the earth I swing on,\nTo it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.\n\nPerhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers\nAnd sisters.\n\nDo you see O my brothers and sisters?\nIt is not chaos or death \u2014 it is form, union, plan \u2014 it is eternal\nLife \u2014 it is Happiness.\n\n51\n\nThe past and present wilt \u2014 I have fill'd them, emptied them,\nAnd proceed to fill my next fold of the future.\n\nListener up there! what have you to confide to me?\nLook in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,\n(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a\nMinute longer.)\n\nDo I contradict myself?\nVery well then I contradict myself,\n(I am large, I contain multitudes.)\n\nI concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.\n\nWho has done his day's work? who will soonest be through\nWith his supper?\nWho wishes to walk with me?\n\nWill you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too\nLate?\n\n52\n\nThe spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains\nOf my gab and my loitering.\n\nI too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,\nI sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.\n\nThe last scud of day holds back for me,\nIt flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the\nShadow'd wilds,\nIt coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.\n\nI depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,\nI effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.\n\nI bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,\nIf you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.\n\nYou will hardly know who I am or what I mean,\nBut I shall be good health to you nevertheless,\nAnd filter and fibre your blood.\nFailing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,\nMissing me one place search another,\nI stop somewhere waiting for you.56Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1087048", "artist_names": "Canned Heat (Ft.

Lyrics[Intro]\nThe day that I met him\nHeh, I was downtown shopping\nWalkin' along, I was kinda thinkin' to myself, you know\nAnd I looked up\nAnd I looked dead into the eyes of\nThe finest man you ever laid on\nGirls, you wouldn't believe it\nHeh, drop top, he was lookin' good\nHe smiled at me and I smiled back at him\nAnd I went on about my shoppin'\nAnd he drove on off\nThinkin' about my shoppin'\nAnd that fine man I just saw\nAnd I looked up and he was standin' right behind me\nSo I didn't want to act like I was afraid or nothin'\nSo he smiled at me and started hittin' on me\nAnd I said \"Say mister\nI already got a man, and he's good to me\"\nSo he said \"It ain't nothin' wrong with havin'\nAnoth\u0435r cup of coffee, baby!\"\nAnd my heart got in the way of my mind\nAnd the d\u0435vil got into me\nAnd we sat down and he rapped to me\nOver the coffee and, he's tellin' me\nAll those sweet and innocent things and\nYou know what, right there\nI lost my heart to him\nBut now, he's gone\nAnd I just wanna let him know how I really-really feel\nNow I'm sittin' here with pencil and paper\nWith tears in my eyes\nBecause I still love him\nAnd I just wanna let him know\n[Verse 1]\nYou-you-you, oh you\nMade me leave my happy home\n(You made me leave my happy home)\nThat's what you did\nYou took my love, and now you gone somewhere (Gone, gone)\nEver since I fell for you (Since I fell, you, since I fell, you)\n(Since I fell for you)\n\n[Verse 2]\nLove-love-love-love-love-love-love\nBring such misery and pain\nOh, I feel hurt tonight\nYou know what?\nI won't never, never, never be the same\nEver since I fell for you (Oh)\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd oh, it's too bad\n(What you gonna do, what you gonna do?)\nToo sad, baby\n(What you gonna do, what you gonna do?)\n(What you gonna do?) That I had to fall in love\nWith a sweet man like you\n(What you gonna do, what you gonna do?)\nYou left me, baby\n(What you gonna do, what you gonna do?)\nThe next day you snubbed me\nWhat can I do about it?\nI'm still in love you, yes I am\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nYou see, I was one of those girls\nThat thought I could never but, never be captured\nHe said he wanted my mind, and he got it\nBut the sad part about it, girls\nIs I still love him\n\n[Verse 5]\nAnd I, guess I'll never-never see the light\nI get those blues about twelve o'clock every night, baby\nYes I do, ever since I fell for you\n(Since I fell, you, since I fell, you)\n(Since I fell for you) Oh, oh-woah\n(Since I fell, since I fell) And ever since that day\nI ain't been the same, baby (Since I fell for you)\n(Since I fell, since I fell)\nYou stole my heart in your alleyway\nYes you did, baby (Since I fell for you)\nI know you were down and down and dirty-dirty\n(Since I fell, since I fell)\nDownright dirty man (Since I fell for you)\nBut I still love you, I still love you, boy\n(Since I fell, since I fell)\n(Since I fell for you) I know you a thousand miles away from me\nBut I love you, I love you (Since I fell, since I fell)\nI love you, baby (Since I fell for you)\nI just couldn't help myself (Since I fell, since I fell)\nI used to jump in your lovin' ride everyday, baby\n(Since I fell for you) But now I'm the backseat\nOf your affections, baby (Since I fell, since I fell)\nOh (Since I fell for you)\nYou don't believe it, but I still love you\n(Since I fell, since I fell) I still long for you every night\n(Since I fell for you) I cry all night long\n(Since I fell, since I fell) Yes I do, baby\n(Since I fell for you) I don't mind drinkin'\nTears for water, baby (Since I fell, since I fell)\nOh no-no-no (Since I fell for you)\n(Since I fell, since I fell) No-no, no-no-no\n(Since I fell for you) I couldn't help it, baby\n(Since I fell, since I fell) I didn't wanna do it, baby\nBut you made me-me love you, babe (Since I fell for you)\nYeah\n[Outro]\n(Since I fell, since I fell for you)\n(Since I fell, since I fell)\n(Since I fell for you)\n(Since I fell, since I fell)\n(Since I fell for you)\n(Since I fell, since I fell)\n(Since I fell for you)\n(Since I fell, since I fell)\n(Since I fell for you)\n(Since I fell, since I fell)Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/3644746", "artist_names": "The Undisputed Truth", "full_title": "What It Is? by\u00a0The\u00a0Undisputed Truth", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/d0852665025fd1a55bfd5c33e438c02b.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d0852665025fd1a55bfd5c33e438c02b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 3644746, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 22594, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1543497858, "path": "/The-undisputed-truth-what-it-is-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/The-undisputed-truth-what-it-is-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1971, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1971", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1971", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/d0852665025fd1a55bfd5c33e438c02b.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d0852665025fd1a55bfd5c33e438c02b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "What It Is?", "title_with_featured": "What It Is?", "updated_by_human_at": 1624598444, "url": "https://genius.com/The-undisputed-truth-what-it-is-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/68332", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9b8feda474b72fb486ccb33b0f05fd80.250x250x1.jpg", "id": 68332, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9b8feda474b72fb486ccb33b0f05fd80.250x250x1.jpg", "index_character": "u", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "The Undisputed Truth", "slug": "The-undisputed-truth", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-undisputed-truth"}, "artist": "The Undisputed Truth", "lyrics": "What It Is?

LyricsIf your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye it's no secret you feel better if you cry\nWhen waking from a bad dream don't you sometimes think it's real\nBut it's only false emotions that you feel\nIf your heartaches seem to hang around too long\nAnd your blues keep getting bluer with each song\nRemember sunshine can be found behind the cloudy sky\nSo let your head down and go on and cry\nIf your heartaches seem to...\nOh let your head down and go on and cryYou might also likeEmbed"}]
