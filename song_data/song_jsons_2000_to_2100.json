regimented wife\nI've no doubt you dream about\nThe things you'll never do\nBut I wish someone had talked to me\nLike I wanna talk of you\n\n[Verse 2]\nOoo, I've been to Georgia\nAnd California\nAnd anywhere I could run\nTook the hand of a preacher man\nAnd we made love in the sun\nBut I ran out of places and friendly faces\nBecause I had to be free\n[Chorus]\nI've been to paradise\nBut I've never been to me\n\n[Verse 3]\nPlease lady, please, lady\nDon't just walk away\n'Cause I have this need to tell you\nWhy I'm all alone today\nI can see so much of me\nStill living in your eyes\nWon't you share a part\nOf a weary heart\nThat has lived a million lives\n\n[Verse 4]\nOh, I've been to Nice\nAnd the isle of Greece\nWhen I sipped champagne on a yacht\nI moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo\nAnd showed 'em what I've got\nI've been undressed by kings\nAnd I've seen some things\nThat a woman ain't supposed to see\n\n[Chorus]\nI've been to paradise\nBut I've never been to me\nYou

you're holding\nAnd it's that man you fought with this morning\nThe same one you're going to make love with tonight\nThat's truth, that's love\n\n[Verse 6]\nSometimes I've been to crying\nFor unborn children\nThat might have made me complete\nBut I, I took the sweet life I never knew\nI'd be bitter from the sweet\nI've spent my life exploring\nThe subtle whoring\nThat costs too much to be free\n\n[Chorus]\nHey lady, I've been to paradise\nBut I've never been to me\nI've been to paradise\nNever been to me\n[Outro]\nI've been to Georgia and California\nAnd anywhere I could run\nI've been

world's full of problems\nThey couldn't touch us even if they tried\nFrom the park I hear rhythms\nMarley's hot on the box\nTonight there will be a party\nOn the corner at the end of the block\n\n[Chorus]\nDidn't know you\nWould be jammin' until the break of dawn\nBet you nobody ever told you that you\nWould be jammin' until the break of dawn\nWould be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on\n[Verse 2]\nThey want us to join their fighting\nBut our answer today\nIs to let all our worries\nLike the breeze through our fingers slip away\nPeace has come to Zimbabwe\nThird World's right on the one\nNow's the time for celebration\n'Cause we've only just begun\n\n[Chorus]\nDidn't know that you\nWould be jammin' until the break of dawn\nBet you nobody ever told you that you\nWould be jammin' until the break of dawn\nBet you nobody ever told you that you\n(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')\nWould be jammin' until the break of dawn\nI know nobody told you that you\n(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')\nWould be jammin' until the the break of dawn\nWe're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou ask me, am I happy?\nWell as matter of fact\nI can say that I'm ecstatic\n'Cause we all just made a pact\nWe've agreed to get together\nJoined as children in Jah\nWhen you're moving in the positive\nYour destination is the brightest star\nSee Stevie Wonder LiveGet tickets as low as $73You might also like[Chorus]\nYou didn't know that you\n(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster

dawn\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you\n(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')\nWould be jammin' until the break of dawn\nDon't you stop the music, oh no, no, no, baby, baby\n(We're

it) Make no mistake where you are\n(This is it) Your back's to the corner\n(This is it) Don't be a fool anymore\n(This is it) The waiting is over\n\n[Verse 2]\nNo room to run, no way to hide\nNo time for wonderin' why\nIt's here, the moment is now, about to decide\nLet him believe\nLeave him behind\nBut keep me near in your heart\nKnow whatever you do\nI'm here by your side\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou say that maybe it's over\nNot if you don't want it to be\nFor once in your life\nHere's your miracle\nStand up and fight\n\n[Chorus]\n(This is it) Make no mistake where you are\n(This is it) You're goin' no further\n(This is it) Until it's over and done\nSee Kenny Loggins LiveGet tickets as low as $71You might also like[Bridge]\n(No one can tell you what you know)\nWoah-oh-ho, woah-ahh\n(Who makes the choice of how it goes?)\nIt's not up to me this time\n(You know?)\nComes a day in every life\n\n[Chorus]\n(This is it) Make no mistake where you are\n(This is it) You're goin' no further\n(This is it) Until it's over and done\n(This is it) One way or another\n(This is it) No one can tell what the future knows\n(This is it) Your back's to the corner\n(This is it) You make the choice of how it goes\n(This is it) The waiting is over\n(This is it) No one can tell what the future knows\n(This is it) You're goin' no further\n(This is it)1Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

minus you is such a lonely ride\nThe breakup we had\nHas made me lonesome and sad\nI realize I love you 'cause I\nWant you back\nHey, hey\n\nI spent the evening with the radio\nRegret the moment that I let you go\nOur quarrel was such\nA way of learnin' so much\nI know now that I love you 'cause I\nNeed your touch\nHey, hey\n[Chorus:]\nReunited\nAnd it feels so good\nReunited\n'Cause we understood\n\nThere's one perfect fit\nAnd sugar, this one is it\nWe both are so excited 'cause we're\nReunited\nHey, hey\n\n[Verse 2: Peaches & Herb]\nI sat here starin' at the same old wall\nCame back to life just when I got your call\nI wished I could climb\nRight through the telephone line\nAnd give you what you want so you would\nStill be mine\nHey, hey\n\nI can't go cheatin', honey, I can't play\nI found it very hard to stay away\nAs we reminisce\nOn precious moments like this\nI'm glad we're back together 'cause I\nMissed your kiss\nHey, hey\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nReunited\nAnd it feels so good\nReunited\n'Cause we understood\n\nThere's one perfect fit\nAnd sugar, this one is it\nWe both are so excited 'cause we're\nReunited\nHey, hey\n\n[Verse 3:

might\nHey, hey\n\n[Chorus]\nReunited\nAnd it feels so good\nReunited\nCause we understood\nThere's one perfect fit\nAnd sugar, this one is it\nWe both are so excited 'cause we're\nReunited\nHey, hey\n\n[Verse 4: Peaches & Herb]\nListen baby\nI won't ever let you cry, I won't let one day go by\nWithout holding you, without kissing you\nWithout loving you\nReunited\nYou're my everything\nOnly you know how to free\nAll the love there is in me\nI wanna let you know, I won't let you go\nI wanna let you know, I won't let you go\nReunited\n\n[Chorus: Peaches & Herb]\nReunited\nAnd it feels so

outside\nI wish you wouldn't make me leave here\n\n[Verse 2]\nI poured it on and I poured it out\nI tried to show you just how much I care\nI'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout\nBut you've been cold to me so long\nI'm cryin' icicles instead of tears\nAnd all I can do is keep on tellin' you\n[Chorus]\nI want you, I need you\nBut there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you\nNow don't be sad, (Don't be sad cause)\nCause two out of three ain't bad\nNow don't be sad, (Cause)\nCause two out of three ain't bad\n\n[Bridge]\nYou'll never find your gold on a sandy beach\nYou'll never drill for oil on a city street\nI know you're lookin' for a ruby in a mountain of rocks\nBut there ain't no Coupe de Ville hidin'\nAt the bottom of a Cracker Jack box\n\nI can't lie, I can't tell you that I'm somethin' I'm not\nNo matter how I try, I'll never be able\nTo give you somethin', somethin' that I just haven't got\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, there's only one girl that I will ever love\nAnd that was so many years ago\nAnd though I know I'll never get her out of my heart\nShe never loved me back, ooh I know\nWell, I remember how she left me on a stormy night\nOh, she kissed me and got out of our bed\nAnd though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door\nShe packed her bags and turned right away\nAnd she kept on tellin' me\nShe kept on tellin' me\nShe kept on tellin' me\nYou might

I'd found my heaven in her arms\nBut the morning when I woke up\nI was here and she was gone\nNow I'm hanging on\nMaybe you can tell me\n[Chorus]\nHow a love so right\nCan turn out to be so wrong\nOh, my darling (Oh, my darling)\nHow a love so right\nCan turn out to be so wrong\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhere did she go\nWhen I need her close to me?\nAnd the perfect story ended at the start\nI thought you came forever\nAnd you came to break my heart\nNow I'm hanging on\nOn the chance that you'll come back to me, oh, my love\n\n[Chorus]\nHow a love so right\nCan turn out to be so wrong (So wrong)\nOh, my darling (Oh, my darling)\nHow a love so right (A love so)\nCan turn out to be so wrong (So wrong)\nOh, my darling\n\n[Bridge]\nI could take it in my stride\nStart living for the moment\nMaybe half the things we sought were never there\nSimply open up our eyes\nAnd break it down to size\nIt isn't really fair\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nHow a love so right\nCan turn out to be so wrong (So

adored you\nLike a million miles away from me, you couldn't see\nHow I adored you\nSo close, so close\nAnd yet so far\n[Verse 1]\nCarried your books from school\nPlaying make-believe you're married to me\nYou were fifth grade, I was sixth\nWhen we came to be\n\n[Verse 2]\nWalking home every day, over\nBarnegat Bridge and Bay\n'Til we grew into the me and you\nWho went our separate ways\n\n[Chorus]\nMy eyes adored you\nThough I never laid a hand on you\nMy eyes adored you\nLike a million miles away from me you couldn't see\nHow I adored you\nSo close, so close\nAnd yet so far\n\n[Verse 3]\nHeaded for city lights\nClimbed the ladder up to fortune and fame\nI worked my fingers to the bone\nMade myself a name\nSee Frankie Valli LiveGet tickets as low as $54You might also like[Verse 4]\nFunny, I seem to find\nThat no matter how the years unwind\nStill I reminisce 'bout the girl I miss\nAnd the love I left behind\n\n[Chorus]\nMy eyes adored you\nThough I never laid a hand on you\nMy eyes adored you\nLike a million miles away from me you couldn't see\nHow I adored you\nSo close, so close\nAnd yet so far\n\n[Bridge]\nAll my life I will remember\nHow warm and tender we were way back then\nThough I'm feeling sad regrets\nI know I won't ever forget you, my childhood friend\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Outro]\n(My eyes adored you\nThough I never laid a hand on you\nMy eyes adored you\nLike a million miles away from me you couldn't see\nHow I adored you\nSo close, so close\nAnd yet so far\nMy eyes adored you\nThough I never laid a hand on you\nMy eyes adored you\nLike a

says, \"I'll see you after school\"\n\nI was shy and so for a while\nMost of my love was touch and smile\nTill she said, \"come on over here\"\nI was nervous, as you might guess\nStill looking for
