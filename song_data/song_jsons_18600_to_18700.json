Lyrics[Intro]\nWell, if you're one of the millions who own one of them gas-drinking, piston-clanking, air-polluting, smoke-belching, four-wheeled buggies from Detroit City, then pay attention\nI'm about to sing your song, son\n\n[Verse 1]\nWell, I'm not a man appointed judge\nTo bear ill will and hold a grudge\nBut I think it's time I said me a few choice words\nAll about that demon automobile\nA metal box with the Polyglas wheel\nThe end result of the dream of Henry Ford\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I've got a car that's mine alone\nThat me and the finance company own\nA ready-made pile of manufactured grief\nAnd if I ain't out of gas in the pouring rain\nI'm a-changin' a flat in a hurricane\nI once spent three days lost on a cloverleaf\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, it ain't just the smoke and the traffic jam\nThat makes me the bitter fool I am\nBut this four-wheel buggy is a-dollarin' me to death\nFor gas and oils and fluids and grease\nAnd wires and tires and antifreeze\nAnd them accessories, well, honey, that's something else\n\n[Verse 4]\nWell, you can get a stereo tape and a color TV\nGet a back-seat bar and reclining seats\nAnd just pay once a month, like you do your rent\nWell, I figured it up and over a period of time\nThis four-thousand dollar car of mine\nCosts fourteen thousand dollars\nAnd ninety-nine cents\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, now, Lord, Mr. Ford, I just wish that you could see\nWhat your simple horseless carriage has become\nWell, it seems your contribution to man\nTo say the least, got a little out of hand\nWell, Lord, Mr. Ford what have you done?\nYou might also like[Verse 5]\nNow the average American father and mother\nOwn one whole car and half another\nAnd I bet that half a car is a trick to drive, don't you?\nBut the thing that amazes me, I guess\nIs the way we measure a man's success\nBy the kind of automobile he can afford to buy\n\n[Verse 6]\nWell, now, red light, green light, traffic cop\nRight turn, no turn, must turn, stop\nGet out the credit card, honey, we're out of gas\nWell, now, all the cars placed end to end\nWould reach to the moon and back again\nAnd there'd probably be some poor fool who'd pull out to pass\n\n[Verse 7]\nWell, now, how I yearn for the good old days\nWithout that carbon dioxide haze\nA-hanging over the roar of the interstate\nWell, if the Lord that made the moon and the stars\nWould have meant for me and you to have cars\nHe'd have seen that we was all born with a parking space\n\n[Chorus]\nLord, Mr. Ford, I just wish that you could see\nWhat your simple horseless carriage has become\nWell, it seems your contribution to man\nTo say the least, got a little out of hand\nWell, Lord, Mr. Ford, what have you done?\n[Outro]\nCome away with me, Lucille\nIn my smoking, choking automobileEmbed"},

leave\nHis clothes all scattered on the floor\nAnd leave the shower running\nAnd forget to close the door\n\nThe way he said each Sunday\nLet's have breakfast here in bed\nAnd all the toast that used to burn\nWhile we'd make love instead\n\n[Repeat Chorus until fade:]\nDoes he hold you till you're sleepig' softly every night?\nDoes he wake you with a kiss to share the morning light?\nAnd when he

Are you tired of empty job titles that just don't get you out of bed in the morning? From banana gassing to wrinkle chasing, check out 10 of the strangest jobs you've never heard of, and stimulate some fascinating career field exploration\n1) ICE CREAM TASTER -- John Harrison has the most delicious job in the business. As Official Ice Cream Taster for Dreyers Ice Cream (not to be confused with Breyers), John gets paid to sample three cartons of each flavor daily to check product quality. He claims the gig isn't all fun and games since he must maintain a strict, spice-free diet; however, being surrounded by Rocky Road sounds like a sweet deal nonetheless\n\nConsider this: You don't have to pack on the butter pecan pounds to whet your appetite for a food services career. From culinary arts to hospitality management, the menu of career options is limitless, as is the employment outlook. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the culinary arts field alone is expected to reach 12 million employees by 2006\n\n2) HAIR SIMULATION SUPERVISOR -- Believe it or not, those proficient in the art of creating 3-D hair are hot commodities in the world of animation. Just ask Mark Thomas Henne, the man responsible for every follicle flip in Pixar's CGI blockbuster, 'The Incredibles.' According to Nathan Pieratt, Director of the Online Animation Program at Westwood College, the industry has shifted from 2-D design to 3-D digital media, giving rise to highly specific jobs. \"This industry is huge,\" Pieratt says. \"Students are blown away by how hard it is and how exciting it is, too\"\nConsider this: Taming techno tresses may be a bit tedious for you, but career opportunities in graphic design abound. For example, someone created the logos on your favorite candy bar and the flash animation you see all over the Web. Without specialized training, however, things can get -- well -- hairy. For success in this field, be prepared to keep up with the latest technologies through continuing education\n\n3) PALLIATIVE CARE TECHNICIAN -- A cross between M.D.s and hospice workers, palliative care technicians ameliorate symptoms, but don't cure disease for terminally ill patients. On top of medical training, technicians must be prepared to handle the legal, psychological, and ethical issues associated with death. Online courses like the End of Life Issues Program at the University of South Florida provide medical professionals with background to help patients and families cope with grief\n\nConsider this: If being around grief and loss is too emotionally draining for you, there are many health care-related positions in which helping others heal is your top priority. Because the health care industry is so expansive (there are 5,764 U.S. registered hospitals, according to AHA Hospital Statistics), there are multiple opportunities from radiology and pathology to becoming a paramedic or physical therapist. Start with an online educational program search\n\n4) BANANA GASSER -- Less flatulent than it sounds, banana gassers finish off what Mother Nature started. To make sure the bottom of your split is tasty, bananas are shipped while they're still green to prevent bruising. Gassers for the JFC Fruit Company are in charge of moving new shipments into hermetically sealed chambers where the fruit is sprayed with an ethylene gas to catalyze ripening. According to the company Web site, trained gassers use the computer program \"Probe\" to determine how much gas should be applied and for how long. The process can take anywhere from three to eight days, after which bananas hit grocery store shelves yellow and ready to be eaten. Bon appetite!\n\nConsider this: This job may be a bit too fruity for your taste, but there's something about chemical reactions and computer analysis that intrigues you. You can ripen your laboratory inclinations by studying biotechnology or clinical laboratory science, all of which have education options online. By the way, highly trained scientists and engineers command a median average salary of $70,000 -- there's nothing odd about that!\n\n5) FIRE SCIENTIST -- If you can take the heat, the market for fire science majors is booming, so to speak. Specializing in experiments involving flame, fire scientists do everything from checking gas pipe leaks to blowing things up. Grads from the University of Maryland's University College online fire science program not only learn the science behind smithereens, but are also trained in emergency management and arson investigation\n\nConsider this: If fire science is too hot for you, don't be alarmed. Criminal justice, homeland security, and public safety administration are other areas in which you can pursue an education to protect and serve your fellow citizens. In addition to state and other public service career opportunities, these fields are booming in the private sector as well, so consider them hot careers\n\n6) INDEPENDENT DUTY CORPSMAN -- Dedicated to providing health care services to military personnel, IDCs are recruits trained to administer treatment to victims of injury and sickness. They're not exactly physicians; however, they're often the only available medical personnel. Touro University International offers specially-tailored online programs designed to provide IDCs with health care credentials. These programs aren't the same as medical residencies, but if you ever need IDC services, you'll have no problem calling them \"Doc.\"\n\nConsider this: You don't have to be on the frontlines in order to practice nursing. The good news is, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has identified nursing as a profession expected to experience above-average growth over the next decade, with 623,000 new positions by 2012\n\n7) WRINKLE CHASER -- This profession has nothing to do with beauty products or the elderly. Wrinkle chasers are in charge of removing, you guessed it, wrinkles, from shoes using specialty irons. Chasers can be assigned to a whole shoe or just a small part, such as the heel, and are in high demand at such companies as Shoemakers, England and Dr. Martens. After all, somebody's got to make sure those Manolos are as smooth as the person wearing them\n\nConsider this: While you may not want to jump into wrinkle chasing with both feet, there is something exciting about being integral in the development of a hot product. Why not try walking in the shoes of a marketing professional or brand manager? Such business skills can be honed through education, and then coupled with knowledge of a product's specific industry and target market for a career that's wrinkle-free\n\n8) KNOWLEDGE FACILITATOR -- The newest addition in the world of business, knowledge facilitators examine what employees need to know and the best ways to distribute that information. Online business students should prick up their ears. Corporate knowledge facilitators are using e learning to make businesses more streamlined. \"Training is no longer a discrete, formal event,\" states Dr. David Shoemaker, vice president of learning solutions for eCornell. \"The ability to deliver knowledge in increasingly granular bits enables learning to be integrated seamlessly into the work flow\"\n\nConsider this: If ever there was proof that keeping up with your educational credentials is necessary for success in the corporate world, the creation of this position says it all. But, hey, you don't need anyone to facilitate your knowledge pursuits, right? Take a step on your own and consider an advanced degree such as an MBA\nYou might also like9) SNAKE MILKER -- You've heard the phrase: \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\" In this case, what doesn't kill you may prove to be a life-saving substance. Snake venom is at once a bodily poison and the primary ingredient in serums that cure snakebites. In areas where poisonous snakes are commonplace, animal care specialists employed to extract venom by \"milking\" the reptile's fangs are crucial\n\nConsider this: In this case, a specialized skill is key to snake-bite survival. And guess what? Corporate advancement can become poisoned if you don't continually arm yourself with top-notch training. That's why it's a smart move to stay immune with specialized business knowledge suited to your \"corporate species,\" whether it's global management mastery, eCommerce skills or entrepreneurial studies\n\n10) LAUGHTER THERAPIST -- If laughter truly is the best medicine, then Dr. Steven Wilson, certified psychologist and Laughter Leader/Joyologist is the doctor for you. Built on the philosophy that giggles, chuckles and belly laughs do a body good, laughter therapists such as Wilson work with clients to help incorporate a smile into patients' daily lives\n\nSo how exactly does it work? \"We don't use jokes, we don't use comedy,\" Wilson reports. \"You're really going inside yourself to connect with the joyful, zestful, exuberant laughter we all had as babies. We not only show people laughter exercises that allow people to lighten up and release that laughter, but we teach how to prevent hardening of the attitudes.\" Regular doses of laughter are proven to alleviate stress, boost the body's immune system, and reduce the signs of aging. Here's one therapy session you don't have to take seriously\n\nConsider this: Jerry Seinfeld or George Carlin you aren't. But just because you can't tell a knock-knock joke the right way, doesn't mean you can't find a meaningful career making a difference in people's lives. In fact, the job opportunities are so abundant for human services professionals, it's certainly nothing to laugh at. Positions dealing with everything from alternative medicine or behavioral sciences, to life care planning or public health, are out there if you're willing to hone your academic skills and earn a degree3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1499721", "artist_names": "Donna Fargo", "full_title": "You Were Always There by\u00a0Donna\u00a0Fargo",

cause you were always there\nYes, you were always there\nSo we never took the time\nFor you to tell me your dreams\nAnd me to tell you mine\n\nAnd we never took the time\nTo talk of love and

would you do differently if you could live again\nAnd were you glad that you gave life to me\n\nAnd I'd give anything to tell you am\nI glad that you were born\nBut you'll never hear the words I've learned to say\nCause before I got to know you died of loneliness\nAnd they tell me I grew up and moved away\n\nYes, you were always there\nSo we never took the time\nFor you to tell me your

shining shoes by Tuesday noon\nAll the fat cats, in the bad hats doing me a real big favor\nGot the fat cats, in the bad hats laying it on real good\n[Abbreviated Chorus]\n\"Here's a dime, boy. Give me a shine, boy.\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen the cold wind comes, it lives at New York City\nAnd the street's no place to be but there you are\nSo you try hard, or you die hard\nNo one really gives a good damn\nYou try hard, and you die hard\nNo one gives a damn\n\n[Chorus]\n\"Here's a dime boy. Give me a shine, boy.\"\nDown and out in New York City\nAin't nowhere to be, but where can you go?\nWhen you're down and out in New York City\n\n[Bridge]\nI'm never, never, never gonna get that way again\nNo, no, no\nNo, no, not me\nWhen you need a friend...\nNeed to have a...\nWhen you want a friend...\n\n[Verse 2]\nGoing to get myself together until the morning\nGoing to leave it all like one bad dream\nAll the fat cats in the bad hats doing me a real big favor\nGot the fat cats in the bad hats laying it on real good\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n\"Here's a dime, boy.

Burton", "lyrics": "Arabian Nights, Vol. 3 (Chap. 13) LyricsTale Of Kamar Al Zaman\n\nThat there was in times of yore and in ages long gone before a King called Shahrim\u00e1n,[FN#220] who was lord of many troops and guards, and officers, and who reigned over certain islands, known as the Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1n Islands,[FN#221] on the borders of the land of the Persians. But he was stricken in years and his bones were wasted, without having been blessed with a son, albeit he had four wives, daughters of Kings, and threescore concubines, with each of whom he was wont to lie one night in turn.[FN#222] This preyed upon his mind and disquieted him, so that he complained thereof to one of his Wazirs, saying, \"Verily I fear lest my kingdom be lost when I die, for that I have no son to succeed me.\" The Minister answered, \"O King, peradventure Allah shall yet bring something to pass; so rely upon the Almighty and be instant in prayer. It is also my counsel that thou spread a banquet and invite to it the poor and needy, and let them eat of thy food; and supplicate the Lord to vouchsafe thee a son; for perchance there may be among thy guests a righteous soul whose prayers find acceptance; and thereby thou shalt win thy wish.\" So the King rose, made the lesser ablution, and prayed a two-bow prayer,[FN#223] then he cried upon Allah with pure intention; after which he called his chief wife to bed and lay with her forthright. By grace of God she conceived and, when her months were accomplished, she bore a male child, like the moon on the night of fulness. The King named him Kamar al-Zam\u00e1n,[FN#224] and rejoiced in him with extreme joy and bade the city be dressed out in his honour; so they decorated the streets seven days, whilst the drums beat and the messengers bore the glad tidings abroad. Then wet and dry nurses were provided for the boy and he was reared in splendour and delight, until he reached the age of fifteen. He grew up of surpassing beauty and seemlihead and symmetry, and his father loved him so dear that he could not brook to be parted from him day or night. One day he complained to a certain of his Ministers anent the excess of his love for his only child, saying, \"O thou the Wazir, of a truth I fear for my son, Kamar al-Zaman, the shifts and accidents which befal man and fain would I marry him in my life-time.\" Answered the Wazir, \"O King, know thou that marriage is one of the most honourable of moral actions, and thou wouldst indeed do well and right to marry thy son in thy lifetime, ere thou make him Sultan.\" On this quoth the King, \"Hither with my son Kamar al-Zaman;\" so he came and bowed his head to the ground in modesty before his sire. \"O Kamar al Zaman,\" said King Shahriman, \"of a truth I desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee during my lifetime.\" Replied he, \"O my father, know that I have no lust to marry nor cloth my soul incline to women; for that concerning their craft and perfidy I have read many books and heard much talk, even as saith the poet,\n\n'Now, an of women ask ye, I reply:\u2014*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In their affairs I'm versed a doctor rare!\nWhen man's head grizzles and his money dwindles, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In their affections he hath naught for share.'\n\nAnd another said:\u2014\n'Rebel against women and so shalt thou serve Allah the more; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The youth who gives women the rein must forfeit all hope to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     soar.\nThey'll baulk him when seeking the strange device, Excelsior, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tho' waste he a thousand of years in the study of science\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     and lore.' \"\n\nAnd when he had ended his verses he continued, \"O my father, wedlock is a thing whereto I will never consent; no, not though I drink the cup of death.\" When Sultan Shahriman heard these words from his son, light became darkness in his sight and he grieved thereat with great grief.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Shahriman heard these words from his son, the light became darkness in his sight and he grieved over his son's lack of obedience to his directions in the matter of marriage; yet, for the great love he bore him, he was unwilling to repeat his wishes and was not wroth with him, but caressed him and spake him fair and showed him all manner of kindness such as tendeth to induce affection. All this, and Kamar al-Zaman increased daily in beauty and loveliness and amorous grace; and the King bore with him for a whole year till he became perfect in eloquence and elegant wit. All men were ravished with his charms; and every breeze that blew bore the tidings of his gracious favour; his fair sight was a seduction to the loving and a garden of delight to the longing, for he was honey-sweet of speech and the sheen of his face shamed the full moon; he was a model of symmetry and blandishment and engaging ways; his shape was as the willow-wand or the rattan- cane and his cheeks might take the place of rose or red anemone. He was, in fine the pink of perfection, even as the poet hath said of him,\n\n\"He came and cried they, 'Now be Allah blest! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Praise Him that clad that soul in so fair vest!'\nHe's King of Beauty where the beauteous be; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     All are his Ryots,[FN#225] all obey his hest:\nHis lip-dew's sweeter than the virgin honey; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His teeth are pearls in double row close press:\nAll charms are congregate in him alone, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And deals his loveliness to man unrest.\nBeauty wrote on those cheeks for worlds to see *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'I testify there is none good but He.'\"[FN#226]\n\nWhen the year came to an end, the King called his son to him and said, \"O my son, wilt thou not hearken to me?\" Whereupon Kamar al-Zaman fell down for respect and shame before his sire and replied, \"O my father, how should I not hearken to thee, seeing that Allah commandeth me to obey thee and not gain-say thee?\" Rejoined King Shahriman, \"O my son, know that I desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee whilst yet I live, and make thee King over my realm, before my death.\" When the Prince heard his sire pronounce these words he bowed his head awhile, then raised it and said, \"O my father, this is a thing which I will never do; no, not though I drink the cup of death! I know of a surety that the Almighty hath made obedience to thee a duty in religion; but, Allah upon thee! press me not in this matter of marriage, nor fancy that I will ever marry my life long; for that I have read the books both of the ancients and the moderns, and have come to know all the mischiefs and miseries which have befallen them through women and their endless artifices. And how excellent is the saying of the poet,\n'He whom the randy motts entrap *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall never see deliverance!\nThough build he forts a thousand-fold, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose mighty strength lead-plates enhance,[FN#227]\nTheir force shall be of no avail; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     These fortresses have not a chance!\nWomen aye deal in treachery *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To far and near o'er earth's expanse\nWith fingers dipt in Henna-blood *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And locks in braids that mad the glance;\nAnd eyelids painted o'er with Kohl *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  They gar us drink of dire mischance.'\n\nAnd how excellently saith another,\n\n'Women, for all the chastity they claim, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Are offal cast by kites where'er they list:\nThis night their talk and secret charms are shine, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That night another joyeth calf and wrist:\nLike inn, whence after night thou far'st at dawn, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lodges other wight thou hast not wist.'\"[FN#228]\n\nNow when King Shahriman heard these his son's words and learnt the import of his verses and poetical quotations, he made no answer, of his excessive love for him, but redoubled in graciousness and kindness to him. He at once broke up the audience and, as soon as the seance was over, he summoned his Minister and taking him apart, said to him, \"O thou the Wazir! tell me how I shall deal with my son in the matter of marriage.\"- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted stay.\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King summoned his Minister; and, taking him apart, said to him, \"O thou the Wazir, tell me what I shall do with my son in the matter of marriage. Of a truth I took counsel with thee thereon and thou didst counsel me to marry him, before making him King. I have spoken with him of wedlock time after time and he still gainsaid me; so do thou, O Wazir, forthright advise me what to do.\" Answered the Minister, \"O King, wait another year and, if after that thou be minded to speak to him on the matter of marriage, speak not to him privily, but address him on a day of state, when all the Emirs and Wazirs are present with the whole of the army standing before thee. And when all are in crowd then send for thy son, Kamar al-Zaman, and summon him; and, when he cometh, broach to him the matter of marriage before the Wazirs and Grandees and Officers of state and Captains; for he will surely be bashful and daunted by their presence and will not dare to oppose thy will.\" Now when King Shahriman heard his Wazir's words, he rejoiced with exceeding joy, seeing success in the project, and bestowed on him a splendid robe of honour. Then he took patience with his son another year, whilst, with every day that passed over him, Kamar al-Zaman increased in beauty and loveliness, and elegance and perfect grace, till he was nigh twenty years old. Indeed Allah had clad him in the cloak of comeliness and had crowned him with the crown of completion: his eye-glance was more bewitching than H\u00e1r\u00fat and Mar\u00fat[FN#229] and the play of his luring looks more misleading than T\u00e1gh\u00fat;[FN#230] and his cheeks shone like the dawn rosy-red and his eyelashes stormed the keen-edged blade: the whiteness of his brow resembled the moon shining bright, and the blackness of his locks was as the murky night; and his waist was more slender than the gossamer[FN#231] and his back parts than two sand heaps bulkier, making a Babel of the heart with their softness; but his waist complained of the weight of his hips and loins; and his charms ravished all mankind, even as one of the poets saith in these couplets,\n\"By his eyelash tendril curled, by his slender waist I swear,\nBy the dart his witchery feathers, fatal hurtling through the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   air;\nBy the just roundness of his shape, by his glances bright and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   keen\nBy the swart limping of his locks, and his fair forehead shining\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sheen;\nBy his eyebrows which deny that she who looks on them should\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sleep,\nWhich now commanding, now forbidding, o'er me high dominion keep;\nBy the roses of his cheek, his face as fresh as myrtle wreath\nHis tulip lips, and those pure pearls that hold the places of his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     teeth;\nBy his noble form, which rises featly turned in even swell\nTo where upon his jutting chest two young pomegranates seem to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   dwell\nBy his supple moving hips, his taper waist, the silky skin,\nBy all he robbed Perfection of, and holds enchained his form\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     within;\nBy his tongue of steadfastness, his nature true, and excellent,\nBy the greatness of his rank, his noble birth, and high descent,\nMusk from my love her savour steals, who musk exhales from every\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     limb\nAnd all the airs ambergris breathes are but the Zephyr's blow\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     o'er him.\nThe sun, methinks, the broad bright sun, as low before my love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     should quail\nAs would my love himself transcend the paltry paring of his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     nail!\"[FN#232]\nSo King Shahriman, having accepted the counsel of his Wazir, waited for another year and a great festival,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shahriman having accepted the counsel of his Wazir, waited for another year and a great festival, a day of state when the audience hall was filled with his Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of his reign and Officers of State and Captains of might and main. Thereupon he sent for his son Kamar al-Zaman who came, and kissing the ground before him three times, stood in presence of his sire with his hands behind his back the right grasping the left.[FN#233] Then said the King to him, \"Know O my son, that I have not sent for thee on this occasion and summoned thee to appear before this assembly and all these officers of estate here awaiting our orders save and except that I may lay a commandment on thee, wherein do thou not disobey me; and my commandment is that thou marry, for I am minded to wed thee to a King's daughter and rejoice in thee ere I die.\" When the Prince heard this much from his royal sire, he bowed his head groundwards awhile, then raising it towards his father and being moved thereto at that time by youthful folly and boyish ignorance, replied, \"But for myself I will never marry; no, not though I drink the cup of death! As for thee, thou art great in age and small of wit: hast thou not, twice ere this day and before this occasion, questioned me of the matter of marriage and I refused my consent? Indeed thou dotest and are not fit to govern a flock of sheep!\" So saying Kamar al-Zaman unclasped his hands from behind his back and tucked up his sleeves above his elbows before his father, being in a fit of fury; moreover, he added many words to his sire, knowing not what he said in the trouble of his spirits. The King was confounded and ashamed, for that this befel in the presence of his grandees and soldier-officers assembled on a high festival and a state occasion; but presently the majesty of Kingship took him, and he cried out at his son and made him tremble. Then he called to the guards standing before him and said, \"Seize him!' So they came forward and laid hands on him and, binding him, brought him before his sire, who bade them pinion his elbows behind his back and in this guise make him stand before the presence. And the Prince bowed down his head for fear and apprehension, and his brow and face were beaded and spangled with sweat; and shame and confusion troubled him sorely. Thereupon his father abused him and reviled him and cried, \"Woe to thee, thou son of adultery and nursling of abomination![FN#234] How durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers? But hitherto none hath chastised thee,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Shahriman cried out to his son Kamar al-Zaman, \"How durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers? But hitherto none hath chastised thee. Knowest thou not that this deed thou hast done were a disgrace to him had it been done by the meanest of my subjects?\" And the King commanded his Mamelukes to loose his elbow bonds and imprison him in one of the bastions of the citadel. So they took the Prince and thrust him into an old tower, wherein there was a dilapidated saloon and in its middle a ruined well, after having first swept it and cleansed its floor-flags and set therein a couch on which they laid a mattress, a leathern rug and a cushion; and then they brought a great lanthorn and a wax candle, for that place was dark, even by day. And lastly the Mamelukes led Kamar al-Zaman thither, and stationed an eunuch at the door. And when all this was done, the Prince threw himself on the couch, sad-spirited, and heavy- hearted; blaming himself and repenting of his injurious conduct to his father, whenas repentance availed him naught, and saying, \"Allah curse marriage and marriageable and married women, the traitresses all! Would I had hearkened to my father and accepted a wife! Had I so done it had been better for me than this jail.\" This is how it fared with him; but as regards King Shahri man, he remained seated on his throne all through the day until sundown; then he took the Minister apart and said to him \"Know thou, O Wazir, that thou and thou only west the cause of all this that hath come to pass between me and my son by the advice thou west pleased to devise; and so what dost thou counsel me to do now?\" Answered he, \"O King, leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days: then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed; and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir, said to King Shahriman, \"Leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days; then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed; and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again.\" The King accepted the Wazir's opinion and lay down to sleep that night troubled at heart concerning his son; for he loved him with dearest love because he had no other child but this; and it was his wont every night not to sleep, save after placing his arm under his son's neck. So he passed that night in trouble and unease on the Prince 's account, tossing from side to side, as he were laid on coals of Artemisia-wood[FN#235]: for he was overcome with doubts and fears and sleep visited him not all that livelong night; but his eyes ran over with tears and he began repeating, ;\n\n\"While slanderers slumber, longsome is my night; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Suffice thee a heart so sad in parting-plight;\nI say, while night in care slow moments by, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'What! no return for thee, fair morning light?'\"\n\nAnd the saying of another,\n\n\"When saw I Pleiad-stars his glance escape *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And Pole star draught of sleep upon him pour;\nAnd the Bier-daughters[FN#236] wend in mourning dight, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I knew that morning was for him no more!\"\n\nSuch was the case with King Shahriman; but as regards Kamar al- Zaman, when the night came upon him the eunuch set the lanthorn before him and lighting the wax-candle, placed it in the candlestick; then brought him somewhat of food. The Prince ate a little and continually reproached himself for his unseemly treatment of his father, saying to himself, \"O my soul, knowest thou not that a son of Adam is the hostage of his tongue, and that a man's tongue is what casteth him into deadly perils?\" Then his eyes ran over with tears and he bewailed that which he had done, from anguished vitals and aching heart, repenting him with exceeding repentance of the wrong wherewith he had wronged his father and repeating,\n\n\"Fair youth shall die by stumbling of the tongue: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Stumble of foot works not man's life such wrong:\nThe slip of lip shall oft smite off the head, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     While slip of foot shall never harm one long.\"\n\nNow when he had made an end of eating, he asked for the wherewithal to wash his hands and when the Mameluke had washed them clean of the remnants of food, he arose and made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the prayers of sundown and nightfall, conjoining them in one; after which he sat down.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Prince Kamar al-Zaman had prayed (conjoining them in one) the prayers of sundown and nightfall, he sat down on the well and began reciting the Koran, and he repeated \"The Cow,\" the \"House of Imr\u00e1n,\" and \"Y. S.;\" \"The Compassionate,\" \"Blessed be the King,\" \"Unity\" and \"The two Talismans''[FN#237]; and he ended with blessing and supplication and with saying, \"I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the stoned.\"[FN#238] Then he lay down upon his couch which was covered with a mattress of satin from al- Ma'adin town, the same on both sides and stuffed with the raw silk of Irak; and under his head was a pillow filled with ostrich-down And when ready for sleep, he doffed his outer clothes and drew off his bag-trousers and lay down in a shirt of delicate stuff smooth as wax; and he donned a head-kerchief of azure Mar\u00e1zi[FN#239] cloth; and at such time and on this guise Kamar al-Zaman was like the full-orbed moon, when it riseth on its fourteenth night. Then, drawing over his head a coverlet of silk, he fell asleep with the lanthorn burning at his feet and the wax-candle over his head, and he ceased not sleeping through the first third of the night, not knowing what lurked for him in the womb of the Future, and what the Omniscient had decreed for him. Now, as Fate and Fortune would have it, both tower and saloon were old and had been many years deserted; and there was therein a Roman well inhabited by a Jinniyah of the seed of Iblis[FN#240] the Accursed, by name Maym\u00fanah, daughter of Al- Dimiry\u00e1t, a renowned King of the J\u00e1nn.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the name of the Jinniyah in question was Maymunah, daughter of Al-Dimiryat; a renowned King of the Jann. And as Kamar al-Zaman continued sleeping till the first third of the night, Maymunah came up out of the Roman well and made for the firmament, thinking to listen by stealth to the converse of the angels; but when she reached the mouth of the well, she saw a light shining in the tower, contrary to custom; and having dwelt there many years without seeing the like, she said to herself, \"Never have I witnessed aught like this\"; and, marvelling much at the matter, determined that there must be some cause therefor. So she made for the light and found the eunuch sleeping within the door; and inside she saw a couch spread, whereon was a human form with the wax-candle burning at his head and the lanthorn at his feet, and she wondered to see the light and stole towards it little by little. Then she folded her wings and stood by the bed and, drawing back the coverlid, discovered Kamar al-Zaman's face. She was motionless for a full hour in admiration and wonderment; for the lustre of his visage outshone that of the candle; his face beamed like a pearl with light; his eyelids were languorous like those of the gazelle; the pupils of his eyes were intensely black and brilliant[FN#241]; his cheeks were rosy red; his eye-brows were arched like bows and his breath exhaled a scent of musk, even as saith of him the poet,\n\n\"I kissed him: darker grew those pupils,[FN#242] which *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Seduce my soul, and cheeks flushed rosier hue;\nO heart, if slanderers dare to deem there be *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His like in chasms, Say 'Bring him hither, you!' \"\n\nNow when Maymunah saw him, she pronounced the formula of praise,[FN#243] and said, \"Blessed be Allah, the best of Creators!\"; for she was of the true-believing Jinn; and she stood awhile gazing on his face, exclaiming and envying the youth his beauty and loveliness. And she said in herself, \"By Allah! I will do no hurt to him nor let any harm him; nay, from all of evil will I ransom him, for this fair face deserveth not but that folk should gaze upon it and for it praise the Lord. Yet how could his family find it in their hearts to leave him in such desert place where, if one of our M\u00e1rids came upon him at this hour, he would assuredly slay him.\" Then the Ifritah Maymunah bent over him and kissed him between the eyes, and presently drew back the sheet over his face which she covered up; and after this she spread her wings and soaring into the air, flew upwards. And after rising high from the circle of the saloon she ceased not winging her way through air and ascending skywards till she drew near the heaven of this world, the lowest of the heavens. And behold, she heard the noisy flapping of wings cleaving the welkin and, directing herself by the sound, she found when she drew near it that the noise came from an Ifrit called Dahnash. So she swooped down on him like a sparrow-hawk and, when he was aware of her and knew her to be Maymunah, the daughter of the King of the Jinn, he feared her and his side-muscles quivered; and he implored her forbearance, saying, I conjure thee by the Most Great and August Name and by the most noble talisman graven upon the seal-ring of Solomon, entreat me kindly and harm me not!\" When she heard these words her heart inclined to him and she said, \"Verily, thou conjurest me, O accursed, with a mighty conjuration. Nevertheless, I will not let thee go, till thou tell me whence thou comest at this hour.\" He replied, \"O Princess, Know that I come from the uttermost end of China-land and from among the Islands, and I will tell thee of a wonderful thing I have seen this night. If thou kind my words true, let me wend my way and write me a patent under thy hand and with thy sign manual that I am thy freedman, so none of the Jinn-hosts, whether of the upper who fly or of the lower who walk the earth or of those who dive beneath the waters, do me let or hindrance.\" Rejoined Maymunah, \"And what is it thou hast seen this night, O liar, O accursed! Tell me without leasing and think not to escape from my hand with falses, for I swear to thee by the letters graven upon the bezel of the seal-ring of Solomon David son (on both of whom be peace!), except thy speech be true, I will pluck out thy feathers with mine own hand and strip off thy skin and break thy bones!\" Quoth the Ifrit Dahnash son of Shamh\u00farish[FN#244] the Flyer, \"I accept, O my lady, these conditions.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-eight Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Dahnash spoke thus to Maymunah, \"I accept, O my lady, these conditions.\" Then he resumed, \"Know, O my mistress, that I come to-night from the Islands of the Inland Sea in the parts of China, which are the realms of King Ghay\u00far, lord of the Islands and the Seas and the Seven Palaces. There I saw a daughter of his, than whom Allah hath made none fairer in her time: I cannot picture her to thee, for my tongue would fail to describe her with her due of praise; but I will name to thee a somewhat of her charms by way of approach. Now her hair is like the nights of disunion and separation and her face like the days of union and delectation; and right well hath the poet said when picturing her,\n\n'She dispread the locks from her head one night, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Showing four fold nights into one night run\nAnd she turned her visage towards the moon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And two moons showed at moment one.'\n\nShe hath a nose like the edge of the burnished blade and cheeks like purple wine or anemones blood-red: her lips as coral and carnelian shine and the water of her mouth is sweeter than old wine; its taste would quench Hell's fiery pain. Her tongue is moved by wit of high degree and ready repartee: her breast is a seduction to all that see it (glory be to Him who fashioned it and finished it!); and joined thereto are two upper arms smooth and rounded; even as saith of her the poet Al-Walah\u00e1n,[FN#245]\n\n'She hath wrists which, did her bangles not contain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would run from out her sleeves in silvern rain.'\n\nShe hath breasts like two globes of ivory, from whose brightness the moons borrow light, and a stomach with little waves as it were a figured cloth of the finest Egyptian linen made by the Copts, with creases like folded scrolls, ending in a waist slender past all power of imagination; based upon back parts like a hillock of blown sand, that force her to sit when she would fief stand, and awaken her, when she fain would sleep, even as saith of her and describeth her the poet,\n\n\n'She hath those hips conjoined by thread of waist, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Hips that o'er me and her too tyrannise\nMy thoughts they daze whene'er I think of them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And weigh her down whene'er she would uprise.'[FN#246]\n\nAnd those back parts are upborne by thighs smooth and round and by a calf like a column of pearl, and all this reposeth upon two feet, narrow, slender and pointed like spear-blades,[FN#247] the handiwork of the Protector and Requiter, I wonder how, of their littleness, they can sustain what is above them. But I cut short my praises of her charms fearing lest I be tedious.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit Dahnash bin Shamhurish said to the Ifritah Maymunah, \"Of a truth I cut short my praises fearing lest I be tedious.\" Now when Maymunah heard the description of that Princess and her beauty and loveliness, she stood silent in astonishment; whereupon Dahnash resumed, \"The father of this fair maiden is a mighty King, a fierce knight, immersed night and day in fray and fight; for whom death hath no fright and the escape of his foe no dread, for that he is a tyrant masterful and a conqueror irresistible, lord of troops and armies and continents and islands, and cities and villages, and his name is King Ghayur, Lord of the Islands and of the Seas and of the Seven Palaces. Now he loveth his daughter, the young maiden whom I have described to thee, with dearest love and, for affection of her, he hath heaped together the treasures of all the kings and built her therewith seven palaces, each of a different fashion; the first of crystal, the second of marble, the third of China steel, the fourth of precious stones and gems of price, the fifth of porcelain and many-hued onyxes and ring bezels, the sixth of silver and the seventh of gold. And he hath filled the seven palaces with all sorts of sumptuous furniture, rich silken carpets and hangings and vessels of gold and silver and all manner of gear that kings require; and hath bidden his daughter to abide in each by turns for a certain season of the year; and her name is the Princess Budur.[FN#248] Now when her beauty became known and her name and fame were bruited abroad in the neighbouring countries, all the kings sent to her father to demand her of him in marriage, and he consulted her on the matter, but she disliked the very word wedlock with a manner of abhorrence and said, O my father, I have no mind to marry; no, not at all; for I am a sovereign Lady and a Queen suzerain ruling over men, and I have no desire for a man who shall rule over me. And the more suits she refused, the more her suitors' eagerness increased and all the Royalties of the Inner Islands of China sent presents and rarities to her father with letters asking her in marriage. So he pressed her again and again with advice on the matter of espousals; but she ever opposed to him refusals, till at last she turned upon him angrily and cried, 'O my father, if thou name matrimony to me once more, I will go into my chamber and take a sword and, fixing its hilt in the ground, will set its point to my waist; then will I press upon it, till it come forth from my back, and so slay myself.' Now when the King heard these her words, the light became darkness in his sight and his heart burned for her as with a flame of fire, because he feared lest she should kill herself; and he was filled with perplexity concerning her affair and the kings her suitors. So he said to her 'If thou be determined not to marry and there be no help for it abstain from going and coming in and out.' Then he placed her in a house and shut her up in a chamber, appointing ten old women as duennas to guard her, and forbade her to go forth to the Seven Palaces; moreover, he made it appear that he was incensed against her, and sent letters to all the kings, giving them to know that she had been stricken with madness by the Jinns; and it is now a year since she hath thus been secluded.\" Then continued the Ifrit Dahnash, addressing the Ifritah Maymunah, \"And I, O my lady go to her every night and take my fill of feeding my sight on her face and I kiss her between the eyes: yet, of my love to her, I do her no hurt neither mount her, for that her youth is fair and her grace surpassing: every one who seeth her jealouseth himself for her. I conjure thee, therefore, O my lady, to go back with me and look on her beauty and loveliness and stature and perfection of proportion; and after, if thou wilt, chastise me or enslave me; and win to thy will, for it is shine to bid and to forbid.\" So saying, the Ifrit Dahnash bowed his head towards the earth and drooped his wings downward; but Maymunah laughed at his words and spat in his face and answered, \"What is this girl of whom thou pratest but a potsherd wherewith to wipe after making water?[FN#249] Faugh! Faugh! By Allah, O accursed, I thought thou hadst some wondrous tale to tell me or some marvellous news to give me. How would it be if thou were to sight my beloved? Verily, this night I have seen a young man, whom if thou saw though but in a dream, thou wouldst be palsied with admiration and spittle would flow from thy mouth.\" Asked the Ifrit, \"And who and what is this youth?\"; and she answered, \"Know, O Dahnash, that there hath befallen the young man the like of what thou tellest me befel thy mistress; for his father pressed him again and again to marry, but he refused, till at length his sire waxed wroth at being opposed and imprisoned him in the tower where I dwell: and I came up to-night and saw him.\" Said Dahnash, \"O my lady, shew me this youth, that I may see if he be indeed handsomer than my mistress, the Princess Budur, or not; for I cannot believe that the like of her liveth in this our age.\" Rejoined Maymunah, \"Thou liest, O accursed, O most ill-omened of Marids and vilest of Satans![FN#250] Sure am I that the like of my beloved is not in this world.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen It was the One Hundred and Eightieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifritah Maymunah spake thus to the Ifrit Dahnash, \"Sure am I that the like of my beloved is not in this world! Art thou mad to fellow thy beloved with my beloved?\" He said, \"Allah upon thee, O my lady, go back with me and look upon my mistress, and after I will with thee and look upon thy beloved.\" She answered, \"It must needs be so, O accursed, for thou art a knavish devil; but I will not go with thee nor shalt thou come with me, save upon condition of a wager which is this. If the lover thou lovest and of whom thou boastest so bravely, prove handsomer than mine whom I mentioned and whom I love and of whom I boast, the bet shall be shine against me; but if my beloved prove the handsomer the bet shall be mine against thee.\" Quoth Dahnash the Ifrit, \"O my lady, I accept this thy wager and am satisfied thereat; so come with me to the Islands.\" Quoth Maymunah; \"No! for the abode of my beloved is nearer than the abode of shine: here it is under us; so come down with me to see my beloved and after we will go look upon thy mistress.\" \"I hear and I obey,\" said Dahnash. So they descended to earth and alighted in the saloon which the tower contained; then Maymunah stationed Dahnash beside the bed and, putting out her hand, drew back the silken coverlet from Kamar al-Zaman's face, when it glittered and glistened and shimmered and shone like the rising sun. She gazed at him for a moment, then turning sharply round upon Dahnash said, \"Look, O accursed, and be not the basest of madmen; I am a maid, yet my heart he hath waylaid.\" So Dahnash looked at the Prince and long continued gazing steadfastly on him then, shaking his head, said to Maymunah, \"By Allah, O my lady, thou art excusable; but there is yet another thing to be considered, and this is, that the estate female differeth from the male. By Allah's might, this thy beloved is the likest of all created things to my mistress in beauty and loveliness and grace and perfection; and it is as though they were both cast alike in the mould of seemlihead.\" Now when Maymunah heard these words, the light became darkness in her sight and she dealt him with her wing so fierce a buffet on the head as well-nigh made an end of him. Then quoth she to him, \"I conjure thee, by the light of his glorious countenance, go at once, O accursed, and bring hither thy mistress whom thou lovest so fondly and foolishly, and return in haste that we may lay the twain together and look on them both as they lie asleep side by side; so shall it appear to us which be the goodlier and more beautiful of the two. Except thou obey me this very moment, O accursed, I will dart my sparks at thee with my fire and consume thee; yea, in pieces I will rend thee and into the deserts cast thee, that to stay at home and wayfarer an example thou be!\" Quoth Dahnash, \"O my lady, I will do thy behests, for I know forsure that my mistress is the fairer and the sweeter.\" So saying the If rit flew away and Maymunah flew with him to guard him. They were absent awhile and presently returned, bearing the young lady, who was clad in a shift of fine Venetian silk, with a double edging of gold and purfled with the most exquisite of embroidery having these couplets worked upon the ends of the sleeves,\n\n\"Three matters hinder her from visiting us, in fear *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Of hate-full, slandering envier and his hired spies:\nThe shining light of brow, the trinkets' tinkling voice, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And scent of essences that tell whene'er she tries:\nGi'en that she hide her brow with edge of sleeve, and leave *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     At home her trinketry, how shall her scent\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     disguise?''[FN#251]\n\nAnd Dahnash and Maymunah stinted not bearing that young lady till they had carried her into the saloon and had laid her beside the youth Kamar al-Zaman.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit Dahnash and the Ifritah Maymunah stinted not bearing Princess Budur till they descended and laid her on the couch beside Kamar al- Zaman. Then they uncovered both their faces, and they were the likest of all folk, each to other, as they were twins or an only brother and sister; and indeed they were a seduction to the pious, even as saith of them the poet Al-Mub\u00edn,\n\n\"O heart! be not thy love confined to one, *\nLest thou by doting or disdain be undone:\nLove all the fair, and thou shalt find with them *\nIf this be lost, to thee that shall be won.\"\n\nAnd quoth another,\n\n\"Mine eyes beheld two lying on the ground; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Both had I loved if on these eyne they lay!\"\n\nSo Dahnash and Maymunah gazed on them awhile, and he said, \"By Allah, O my lady, it is good! My mistress is assuredly the fairer.\" She replied, \"Not so, my beloved is the fairer; woe to thee, O Dahnash! Art blind of eye and heart that lean from fat thou canst not depart? Wilt thou hide the truth? Dost thou not see his beauty and loveliness and fine stature and symmetry? Out on thee, hear what I purpose to say in praise of my beloved and, if thou be a lover true to her thou dost love, do thou the like for her thou Lovest.\" Then she kissed Kamar al-Zaman again and again between the eyes and improvised this ode,\n\n\"How is this? Why should the blamer abuse thee in his pride?\nWhat shall console my heart for thee, that art but slender bough?\n\nA Nature Kohl'd[FN#252] eye thou hast that witcheth far and wide;\nFrom pure platonic love[FN#253] of it deliverance none I trow!\n\nThose glances, fell as plundering Turk, to heart such havoc deal\nAs never havocked scymitar made keenest at the curve.\n\nOn me thou layest load of love the heaviest while I feel\nSo feeble grown that under weight of chemisette I swerve.\n\nMy love for thee as wottest well is habit, and my lowe\nIs nature; to all others false is all the love I tender:\n\nNow were my heart but like to shine I never would say No;\nOnly my wasted form is like thy waist so gracious slender:\n\nOut on him who in Beauty's robe for moon like charms hath fame,\nAnd who is claimed by mouth of men as marvel of his tribe!\n\n'Of man what manner may he be' (ask they who flyte and blame)\n'For whom thy heart is so distressed?'

That brow e'er raying radiant light! Those eyne wherein white jostles black![FN#255] That dearling dainty frame!\"\n\nWhen Dahnash heard the poesy which Maymunah spake in praise of her beloved, he joyed with exceeding joy and marvelled with excessive wonderment.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Ifrit Dahnash heard the poesy which Maymunah spake in praise of her beloved, he shook for exceeding joy and said, \"Thou hast celebrated thy beloved in song and thou hast indeed done well in praise of him whom thou lovest! And there is no help for it but that I also in my turn do my best to enfame my mistress, and recite somewhat in her honour.\" Then the Ifrit went up to the Lady Budur; and' kissing her between the eyes, looked at Maymunah and at his beloved Princess and recited the following verses, albeit he had no skill in poesy,\n\n\"Love for my fair they chide in angry way; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unjust for ignorance, yea unjustest they!\nAh lavish favours on the love mad, whom *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Taste of thy wrath and parting woe shall slay:\nIn sooth for love I'm wet with railing tears, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That rail mine eyelids blood thou mightest say:\nNo marvel what I bear for love, 'tis marvel *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That any know my \"me\" while thou'rt away:\nUnlawful were our union did I doubt *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thy love, or heart incline to other May.\"\n\nAnd eke these words:\u2014\n\n\"I feed eyes on their stead by the valley's side, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And I'm slain and my slaver[FN#256] aside hath tried:\nGrief-wine have I drunken, and down my cheeks *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Dance tears to the song of the camel-guide:\nFor union-blessing I strive though sure, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In Budur and Su'ad all my bliss shall bide:[FN#257]\nWot I not which of three gave me most to 'plain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So hear them numbered ere thou decide:\nThose Sworders her eyne, that Lancer her fig- *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     -ure, or ring-mail'd Locks which her forehead hide.\nQuoth she (and I ask of her what so wights *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Or abide in towns or in desert ride[FN#258] )\nTo me, 'In thy heart I dwell, look there!' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Quoth I, 'Where's my heart ah where? ah where?'\"\n\nWhen Maymunah heard these lines from the Ifrit, she said, \"Thou hast done well, O Dahnash! But say thou which of the two is the handsomer?\" And he answered, \"My mistress Budur is handsomer than thy beloved!\" Cried Maymunah, \"Thou liest, O accursed. Nay, my beloved is more beautiful than shine!\" But Dahnash persisted, \"Mine is the fairer.\" And they ceased not to wrangle and challenge each other's words till Maymunah cried out at Dahnash and would have laid violent hands on him, but he humbled himself to her and, softening his speech, said, \"Let not the truth be a grief to thee, and cease we this talk, for all we say is to testify in favour of our lovers; rather let each of us withdraw the claim and seek we one who shall judge fairly between us which of the two be fairer; and by his sentence we will abide.\" \"I agree to this,\" answered she and smote the earth with her foot, whereupon there came out of it an Ifrit blind of an eye, humpbacked and scurvy-skinned, with eye-orbits slit up and down his face.[FN#259] On his head were seven horns and four locks of hair fell to his heels; his hands were pitchfork-like and his legs mast-like and he had nails as the claws of a lion, and feet as the hoofs of the wild ass.[FN#260] When that If rit rose out of the earth and sighted Maymunah, he kissed the ground before her and, standing with his hands clasped behind him, said, \"What is thy will, O my mistress, O daughter of my King?\"[FN#261] She replied, \"O Kashkash, I would have thee judge between me and this accursed Dahnash.\" And she made known to him the matter, from first to last, whereupon the Ifrit Kashkash looked at the face of the youth and then at the face of the girl; and saw them lying asleep, embraced, each with an arm under the other's neck, alike in beauty and loveliness and equal in grace and goodliness. The Marid gazed long upon them, marvelling at their seemlihead; and, after carefully observing the twain, he turned to Maymunah and Dahnash, and reseated these couplets.\n\n\"Go, visit her thou lovest, and regard not\nThe words detractors utter, envious churls\nCan never favour love. Oh! sure the Merciful\nNe'er made a thing more fair to look upon,\nThan two fond lovers in each others' arms,\nSpeaking their passion in a mute embrace.\nWhen heart has turned to heart, the fools would part them\nStrike idly on cold steel. So when thou'st found\nOne purely, wholly shine, accept her true heart,\nAnd live for her alone. Oh! thou that blamest\nThe love-struck for their love, give o'er thy talk,\nHow canst thou minister to a mind diseased?\"[FN#262]\n\nThen he turned again to Maymunah and Dahnash and said to them, \"By Allah, if you will have the truth, I tell you fairly the twain be equal in beauty, and loveliness and perfect grace and goodliness, nor can I make any difference between them on account of their being man and woman. But I have another thought which is that we wake each of them in turn, without the knowledge of the other, and whichever is the more enamoured shall be held inferior in seemlihead and comeliness.\" Quoth Maymunah, \"Right is this recking,\" and quoth Dahnash, \"I consent to this.\" Then Dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit Kamar al-Zaman, whereupon he started from sleep in a fright.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-third Night,\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit Kamar al-Zaman who started from sleep in a fright and rubbed the bitten part, his neck, and scratched it hard because of the smart. Then turning sideways, he found lying by him something whose breath was sweeter than musk and whose skin was softer than cream. Hereat marvelled he with great marvel and he sat up and looked at what lay beside him; when he saw it to be a young lady like an union pearl, or a shining sun, or a dome seen from afar on a well built wall; for she was five feet tall, with a shape like the letter Alif[FN#263], bosomed high and rosy checked; even as saith of her the poet,\n\n\"Four things which ne'er conjoin, unless it be *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To storm my vitals and to shed my blood:\nBrow white as day and tresses black as night *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cheeks rosy red and lips which smiles o'erflood.\"\n\nAnd also quoth another,\n\n\"A Moon she rises, Willow wand she waves, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Breathes Ambergris, and gazes, a Gazelle:\nMeseems that sorrow woes my heart and wins *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And, when she wendeth hastes therein to dwell!\"\n\nAnd when Kamar al-Zaman saw the Lady Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, and her beauty and comeliness, she was sleeping clad in a shift of Venetian silk, without her petticoat-trousers, and wore on her head a kerchief embroidered with gold and set with stones of price: her ears were hung with twin earrings which shone like constellations and round her neck was a collar of union pearls, of size unique, past the competence of any King. When he saw this, his reason was confounded and natural heat began to stir in him; Allah awoke in him the desire of coition and he said to himself, \"Whatso Allah willeth, that shall be, and what He willeth not shall never be!\" So saying, he put out his hand and, turning her over, loosed the collar of her chemise; then arose before his sight her bosom, with its breasts like double globes of ivory; whereat his inclination for her redoubled and he desired her with exceeding hot desire, He would have awakened her but she would not awake, for Dahnash had made her sleep heavy; so he shook her and moved her, saying, \"O my beloved, awake and look on me; I am Kamar al-Zaman.\" But she awoke not, neither moved her head; where-upon he considered her case for a long hour and said to himself, \"If I guess aright, this is the damsel to whom my father would have married me and these three years past I have refused her; but Inshallah!\u2014God willing\u2014as soon as it is dawn, I will say to him, 'Marry me to her, that I may enjoy her.'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to himself, \"By Allah, when I see dawn I will say to my sire, 'Marry me to her that I may enjoy her'; nor will I let half the day pass ere I possess her and take my fill of her beauty and loveliness.\" Then he bent over Budur to buss her, whereat the Jinniyah Maymunah trembled and was abashed and Dahnash, the Ifrit, was like to fly for joy. But, as Kamar al- Zaman was about to kiss her upon the mouth, he was ashamed before Allah and turned away his head and averted his face, saying to his heart, \"Have patience.\" Then he took thought awhile and said, \"I will be patient; haply my father when he was wroth with me and sent me to this jail, may have brought my young lady and made her lie by my side to try me with her, and may have charged her not to be readily awakened when I would arouse her, and may have said to her, 'Whatever thing Kamar al-Zaman do to thee, make me ware thereof'; or belike my sire standeth hidden in some stead whence (being himself unseen) he can see all I do with this young lady; and to morrow he will scold me and cry, 'How cometh it that thou sayest, I have no mind to marry; and yet thou didst kiss and embrace yonder damsel?' So I will withhold myself lest I be ashamed before my sire; and the right and proper thing to do is not to touch her at this present, nor even to look upon her, except to take from her somewhat which shall serve as a token to me and a memorial of her; that some sign endure between me and her.\" Then Kamar al-Zaman raised the young lady's hand and took from her little finger a seal-ring worth an immense amount of money, for that its bezel was a precious jewel and around it were graven these couplets,\n\n\"Count not that I your promises forgot, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Despite the length of your delinquencies\nBe generous, O my lord, to me inclining; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply your mouth and cheeks these lips may kiss:\nBy Allah, ne'er will I relinquish you *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Albe you will transgress love's boundaries.\"\n\nThen Kamar al-Zaman took the seal-ring from the little finger of Queen Budur and set it on his own; then, turning his back to her, went to sleep.[FN#264] When Maymunah the Jinniyah saw this, she was glad and said to Dahnash and Kashkash, \"Saw ye how my beloved Kamar al-Zaman bore himself chastely towards this young lady? Verily, this was of the perfection of his good gifts; for observe you twain how he looked on her and noted her beauty and loveliness, and yet embraced her not neither kissed her nor put his hand to her, but turned his back and slept.\" Answered they, \"Even so!\" Thereupon Maymunah changed herself into a flea and entering into the raiment of Budur, the loved of Dahnash, crept up her calf and came upon her thigh and, reaching a place some four carats[FN#265] below her navel, there bit her. Thereupon she opened her eyes and sitting up in bed, saw a youth lying beside her and breathing heavily in his sleep, the loveliest of Almighty Allah's creatures, with eyes that put to shame the fairest Houris of Heaven; and a mouth like Solomon's seal, whose water was sweeter to the taste and more efficacious than a theriack, and lips the colour of coral-stone, and cheeks like the blood red anemone, even as saith one, describing him in these couplets,\n\n\"My mind's withdrawn from Zaynab and Naw\u00e1r[FN#266] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     By rosy cheeks that growth of myrtle bear;\nI love a fawn, a tunic-vested boy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And leave the love of bracelet-wearing Fair:\nMy mate in hall and closet is unlike *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Her that I play with, as at home we pair.\nOh thou, who blam'st my flight from Hind and Zaynab, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The cause is clear as dawn uplighting air!\nWould'st have me fare[FN#267] a slave, the thrall of thrall, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cribbed, pent, confined behind the bar and wall?\"\n\nNow when Princess Budur saw him, she was seized by a transport of passion and yearning and love-longing,\u2014And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Budur saw Kamar al-Zaman she was forthwith seized with a transport of passion and yearning and love longing, and she said to herself, \"Alas, my shame! This is a strange youth and I know him not. How cometh he to be lying by my side on one bed?\" Then she looked at him a second time and, noting his beauty and loveliness, said, \"By Allah, he is indeed a comely youth and my heart[FN#268] is well-nigh torn in sunder with longing for him! But alas, how am I shamed by him! By the Almighty, had I known it was this youth who sought me in marriage of my father, I had not rejected him, but had wived with him and enjoyed his loveliness!\" Then she gazed in his face and said, \"O my lord and light of mine eyes, awake from sleep and take thy pleasure in my beauty and grace.\" And she moved him with her hand; but Maymunah the Jinniyah let down sleep upon him as it were a curtain, and pressed heavily on his head with her wings so that Kamar al-Zaman awoke not. Then Princess Budur shook him with her hands and said, \"My life on thee, hearken to me; awake and up from thy sleep and look on the narcissus and the tender down thereon, and enjoy the sight of naked waist and navel; and touzle me and tumble me from this moment till break of day! Allah upon thee, O my lord, sit up and prop thee against the pillow and slumber not!\" Still Kamar al-Zaman made her no reply but breathed hard in his sleep. Continued she, \"Alas! Alas! thou art insolent in thy beauty and comeliness and grace and loving looks! But if thou art handsome, so am I handsome; what then is this thou dost? Have they taught thee to flout me or hath my father, the wretched old fellow,[FN#269] made thee swear not to speak to me to-night?\" But Kamar al-Zaman opened not his mouth neither awoke, whereat her passion for him redoubled and Allah inflamed her heart with love of him. She stole one glance of eyes that cost her a thousand sighs: her heart fluttered, and her vitals throbbed and her hands and feet quivered; and she said to Kamar al-Zaman \"Talk to me, O my lord! Speak to me, O my friend! Answer me, O my beloved, and tell me thy name, for indeed thou hast ravished my wit!\" And during all this time he abode drowned in sleep and answered her not a word, and Princess Budur sighed and said, \"Alas! Alas! why art thou so proud and self satisfied?\" Then she shook him and turning his hand over, saw her seal-ring on his little finger, whereat she cried a loud cry, and followed it with a sigh of passion and said, \"Alack! Alack! By Allah, thou art my beloved and thou lovest me! Yet thou seemest to turn thee away from me out of coquetry, for all, O my darling, thou camest to me, whilst I was asleep and knew not what thou didst with me, and tookest my seal-ring; and yet I will not pull it off thy finger.\" So saying, she opened the bosom of his shirt and bent over him and kissed him and put forth her hand to him, seeking somewhat that she might take as a token, but found nothing. Then she thrust her hand into his breast and, because of the smoothness of his body, it slipped down to his waist and thence to his navel and thence to his yard, whereupon her heart ached and her vitals quivered and lust was sore upon her, for that the desire of women is fiercer than the desire of men,[FN#270] and she was ashamed of her own shamelessness. Then she plucked his seal-ring from his finger, and put it on her own instead of the ring he had taken, and bussed his inner lips and hands, nor did she leave any part of him unkissed; after which she took him to her breast and embraced him and, laying one of her hands under his neck and the other under his arm-pit, nestled close to him and fell asleep by his side.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Budur fell asleep by the side of Kamar al-Zaman, after doing that which she did, quoth Maymunah to Dahnash, Night thou, O accursed, how proudly and coquettishly my beloved bore himself, and how hotly and passionately thy mistress showed herself to my dearling? There can be no doubt that my beloved is handsomer than shine; nevertheless I pardon thee.\" Then she wrote him a document of manumission and turned to Kashkash and said, \"Go, help Dahnash to take up his mistress and aid him to carry her back to her own place, for the night waneth apace and there is but little left of it.\" \"I hear and I obey;\" answered Kashkash. So the two Ifrits went forward to Princess Budur and upraising her flew away with her; then, bearing her back to her own place, they laid her on her bed, whilst Maymunah abode alone with Kamar al-Zaman, gazing upon him as he slept, till the night was all but spent, when she went her way. As soon as morning morrowed, the Prince awoke from sleep and turned right and left, but found not the maiden by him and said in his mind, \"What is this business? It is as if my father would incline me to marriage with the damsel who was with me and have now taken her away by stealth, to the intent that my desire for wedlock may redouble.\" Then he called out to the eunuch who slept at the door, saying, \"Woe to thee, O damned one, arise at once!\" So the eunuch rose, bemused with sleep, and brought him basin and ewer, whereupon Kamar al-Zaman entered the water closet and did his need;[FN#271] then, coming out made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the dawn-prayer, after which he sat telling on his beads the ninety-and-nine names of Almighty Allah. Then he looked up and, seeing the eunuch standing in service upon him, said, \"Out on thee, O Saw\u00e1b! Who was it came hither and took away the young lady from my side and I still sleeping?\" Asked the eunuch, 'O my lord, what manner of young lady?\" \"The young lady who lay with me last night,\" replied Kamar al-Zaman. The eunuch was startled at his words and said to him, \"By Allah, there hath been with thee neither young lady nor other! How should young lady have come in to thee, when I was sleeping in the doorway and the door was locked? By Allah, O my lord, neither male nor female hath come in to thee!\" Exclaimed the Prince, \"Thou liest, O pestilent slave!: is it of thy competence also to hoodwink me and refuse to tell me what is become of the young lady who lay with me last night and decline to inform me who took her away?\" Replied the eunuch (and he was affrighted at him), \"By Allah, O my lord, I have seen neither young lady nor young lord!\" His words only angered Kamar al-Zaman the more and he said to him, \"O accursed one, my father hath indeed taught thee deceit! Come hither.\" So the eunuch came up to him, and the Prince took him by the collar and dashed him to the ground; whereupon he let fly a loud fart[FN#272] and Kamar al-Zaman, kneeling upon him, kicked him and throttled him till he fainted away. Then he dragged him forth and tied him to the well-rope, and let him down like a bucket into the well and plunged him into the water, then drew him up and lowered him down again. Now it was hard winter weather, and Kamar al-Zaman ceased not to plunge the eunuch into the water and pull him up again and douse him and haul him whilst he screamed and called for help; and the Prince kept on saying \"By Allah, O damned one, I will not draw thee up out of this well till thou tell me and fully acquaint me with the story of the young lady and who it was took her away, whilst I slept.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One and Eighty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to the eunuch, \"By Allah! I will not draw thee up out of this well until thou tell me the story of the young lady and who it was took her away whilst I slept.\" Answered the eunuch, after he had seen death staring him in the face; \"O my lord, let me go and I will relate to thee the truth and the whole tale.\" So Kamar al-Zaman pulled him up out of the well, all but dead for suffering, what with cold and the pain of dipping and dousing, drubbing and dread of drowning. He shook like cane in hurricane, his teeth were clenched as by cramp and his clothes were drenched and his body befouled and torn by the rough sides of the well: briefly he was in a sad pickle. Now when Kamar al-Zaman saw him in this sorry plight, he was concerned for him; but, as soon as the eunuch found himself on the floor, he said to him, \"O my lord, let me go and doff my clothes and wring them out and spread them in the sun to dry, and don others; after which I will return to thee forthwith and tell thee the truth of the matter.\" Answered the Prince, \"O rascal slave! hadst thou not seen death face to face, never hadst thou confessed to fact nor told me a word; but go now and do thy will, and then come back to me at once and tell me the truth.\" Thereupon the eunuch went out, hardly crediting his escape, and ceased not running, stumbling and rising in his haste, till he came in to King Shahriman, whom he found sitting at talk with his Wazir of Kamar al-Zaman's case. The King was saying to the Minister, \"I slept not last night, for anxiety concerning my son, Kamar al-Zaman and indeed I fear lest some harm befal him in that old tower. What good was there in imprisoning him?\" Answered the Wazir, \"Have no care for him. By Allah, no harm will befal him! None at all! Leave him in prison for a month till his temper yield and his spirit be broken and he return to his senses.\" As the two spoke behold, up rushed the eunuch, in the aforesaid plight, making to the King who was troubled at sight of him; and he cried \"O our lord the Sultan! Verily, thy son's wits are fled and he hath gone mad, he hath dealt with me thus and thus, so that I am become as thou seest me, and he kept saying, 'A young lady lay with me this night and stole away secretly whilst I slept. Where is she?' And he insisteth on my letting him know where she is and on my telling him who took her away. But I have seen neither girl nor boy: the door was locked all through the night, for I slept before it with the key under my head, and I opened to him in the morning with my own hand. When King Shahriman heard this, he cried out, saying, \"Alas, my son!;\" and he was enraged with sore rage against the Wazir, who had been the cause of all this case and said to him, \"Go up, bring me news of my son and see what hath befallen his mind.\" So the Wazir rose and, stumbling over his long skirts, in his fear of the King's wrath, hastened with the slave to the tower. Now the sun had risen and when the Minister came in to Kamar al-Zaman, he found him sitting on the couch reciting the Koran; so he saluted him and seated himself by his side, and said to him, \"O my lord, this wretched eunuch brought us tidings which troubled and alarmed us and which incensed the King.\" Asked Kamar al-Zaman, \"And what hath he told you of me to trouble my father? In good sooth he hath troubled none but me.\" Answered the Wazir, \"He came to us in fulsome state and told us of thee a thing which Heaven forfend; and the slave added a lie which it befitteth not to repeat, Allah preserve thy youth and sound sense and tongue of eloquence, and forbid to come from thee aught of offense!\" Quoth the Prince, \"O Wazir, and what thing did this pestilent slave say of me?\" The Minister replied, \"He told us that thy wits had taken leave of thee and thou wouldst have it that a young lady lay with thee last night, and thou west instant with him to tell thee whither she went and thou diddest torture him to that end.\" But when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he was enraged with sore rage and he said to the Wazir, \"'Tis manifest to me in very deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her per misted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman heard the words of the Wazir he was enraged with sore rage and said to him, \"'Tis manifest to me in very deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did and forbade him to tell me what became of the young lady who lay with me last night. But thou, O Wazir, art cleverer than the eunuch, so do thou tell me without stay or delay, whither went the young lady who slept on my bosom last night; for it was you who sent her and bade her steep in my embrace and we lay together till dawn; but, when I awoke, I found her not. So where is she now?\" Said the Wazir, \"O my lord Kamar al-Zaman, Allah's name encompass thee about! By the Almighty, we sent none to thee last night, but thou layest alone, with the door locked on thee and the eunuch sleeping behind it, nor did there come to thee young lady or any other. Regain thy reason, O my lord, and stablish thy senses and occupy not thy mind with vanities.\" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman who was incensed at his words, \"O Wazir, the young lady in question is my beloved, the fair one with the black eyes and rosy cheeks, whom I held in my arms all last night.\" So the Minister wondered at his words and asked him, \"Didst thou see this damsel last night with shine own eyes on wake or in sleep?\" Answered Kamar al-Zaman, \"O ill- omened old man, dost thou fancy I saw her with my ears? Indeed, I saw her with my very eyes and awake, and I touched her with my hand, and I watched by her full half the night, feeding my vision on her beauty and loveliness and grace and tempting looks. But you had schooled her and charged her to speak no word to me; so she feigned sleep and I lay by her side till dawn, when I awoke and found her gone.\" Rejoined the Wazir, \"O my lord Kamar al- Zaman, haply thou sawest this in thy sleep; it must have been a delusion of dreams or a deception caused by eating various kinds of food, or a suggestion of the accursed devils.\" Cried the Prince, \"O pestilent old man! wilt thou too make a mock of me and tell me this was haply a delusion of dreams, when that eunuch confessed to the young lady, saying, 'At once I will return to thee and tell thee all about her?'\" With these words, he sprang up and rushed at the Wazir and gripped hold of his beard (which was long[FN#273]) and, after gripping it, he twisted his hand in it and haling him off the couch, threw him on the floor. It seemed to the Minister as though his soul departed his body for the violent plucking at his beard; and Kamar al-Zaman ceased not kicking the Wazir and basting his breast and ribs and cuffing him with open hand on the nape of his neck till he had well-nigh beaten him to death. Then said the old man in his mind, \"Just as the eunuch-slave saved his life from this lunatic youth by telling him a lie, thus it is even fitter that I do likewise; else he will destroy me. So now for my lie to save myself, he being mad beyond a doubt.\" Then he turned to Kamar al-Zaman and said, \"O my lord, pardon me; for indeed thy father charged me to conceal from thee this affair of the young lady; but now I am weak and weary and wounded with funding; for I am an old man and lack strength and bottom to endure blows. Have, therefore, a little patience with me and I will tell thee all and acquaint thee with the story of the young woman.\" When the Prince heard this, he left off drubbing him and said, \"Wherefore couldst thou not tell me the tale until after shame and blows? Rise now, unlucky old man that thou art, and tell me her story.\" Quoth the Wazir, \"Say, dost thou ask of the young lady with the fair face and perfect form?\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"Even so! Tell me, O Wazir, who it was that led her to me and laid her by my side, and who was it that took her away from me by night; and let me know forthright whither she is gone, that I myself may go to her at once. If my father did this deed to me that he might try me by means of that beautiful girl, with a view to our marriage, I consent to wed her and free myself of this trouble; for he did all these dealings with me only because I refused wedlock. But now I consent and I say again, I consent to matrimony: so tell this to my father, O Wazir, and advise him to marry me to that young lady; for I will have none other and my heart loveth none save her alone. Now rise up at once and haste thee to my father and counsel him to hurry on our wedding and bring me his answer within this very hour.\" Rejoined the Wazir, \"'Tis well!\" and went forth from him, hardly believing himself out of his hands. Then he set off from the tower, walking and tripping up as he went, for excess of fright and agitation, and he ceased not hurrying till he came in to King Shahriman.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-nineth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir, fared forth from the tower, and ceased not running till he came in to King Shahriman, who said to him as he sighted him, \"O thou Wazir, what man hath brought thee to grief and whose mischief hath treated thee in way unlief; how happeneth it that I see thee dumb foundered and coming to me thus astounded?\" Replied the Wazir, \"O King! I bring thee good news.\" \"And what is it?\" quoth Shahriman, and quoth the Wazir, \"Know that thy son Kamar al- Zaman's wits are clean gone and that he hath become stark mad.\" Now when the King heard these words of the Minister, light became darkness in his sight and he said, \"O Wazir, make clear to me the nature of his madness.\" Answered the Wazir, \"O my lord, I hear and I obey.\" Then he told him that such and such had passed and acquainted him with all that his son had done; whereupon the King said to him, \"Hear, O Wazir, the good tidings which I give thee in return for this thy fair news of my son's insanity; and it shall be the cutting off of thy head and the forfeiture of my favour, O most ill-omened of Wazirs and foulest of Emirs! for I feel that thou hast caused my son's disorder by the wicked advice and the sinister counsel thou hast given me first and last. By Allah, if aught of mischief or madness have befallen my son I will most assuredly nail thee upon the palace dome and make thee drain the bitterest draught of death!'' Then he sprang up and, taking the Wazir, with him, fared straight for the tower and entered it. And when Kamar al-Zaman saw the two, he rose to his father in haste from the couch whereon he sat and kissing his hands drew back and hung down his head and stood before him with his arms behind him, and thus remained for a full hour. Then he raised his head towards his sire; the tears gushed from his eyes and streamed down his cheeks and he began repeating,\n\n\"Forgive the sin 'neath which my limbs are trembling,\nFor the slave seeks for mercy from his master;\nI've done a fault, which calls for free confession,\nWhere shall it call for mercy, and forgiveness?''[FN#274]\n\nWhen the King heard this, he arose and embraced his son, and kissing him between the eyes, made him sit by his side on the couch; then he turned to the Wazir, and, looking on him with eyes of wrath, said, \"O dog of Wazirs, how didst thou say of my son such and such things and make my heart quake for him?\" Then he turned to the Prince and said, \"O my son, what is to-day called?\" He answered, \"O my father, this day is the Sabbath, and to morrow is First day: then come Second day, Third, Fourth, Fifth day and lastly Friday.\"[FN#275] Exclaimed the King, \"O my son, O Kamar al-Zaman, praised be Allah for the preservation of thy reason! What is the present month called in our Arabic?\" \"Z\u00fa'l Ka'adah,\" answered Kamar al-Zaman, \"and it is followed by Z\u00fa'l hijjah; then cometh Muharram, then Safar, then Rab\u00ed'a the First and Rab\u00ed'a the Second, the two Jam\u00e1d\u00e1s, Rajab, Sha'aban, Ramaz\u00e1n and Shaww\u00e1l.\" At this the King rejoiced exceedingly and spat in the Wazir's face, saying, \"O wicked old man, how canst thou say that my son is mad? And now none is mad but thou.\" Hereupon the Minister shook his head and would have spoken, but bethought himself to wait awhile and see what might next befal. Then the King said to his child, \"O my son, what words be these thou saddest to the eunuch and the Wazir, declaring, 'I was sleeping with a fair damsel this night?'[FN#276] What damsel is this of whom thou speakest?\" Then Kamar al-Zaman laughed at his father's words and replied, \"O my father, know that I can bear no more jesting; so add me not another mock or even a single word on the matter, for my temper hath waxed short by that you have done with me. And know, O my father, with assured knowledge, that I consent to marry, but on condition that thou give me to wife her who lay by my side this night; for I am certain it was thou sentest her to me and madest me in love with her and then despatchedst a message to her before the dawn and tookest her away from beside me.\" Rejoined the King, \"The name of Allah encompass thee about, O my son, and be thy wit preserved from witlessness!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninetieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth King Shahriman to his son Kamar al-Zaman, \"The name of Allah encompass thee about, O my son, and be thy wit preserved from witlessness! What thing be this young lady whom thou fanciest I sent to thee last night and then again that I sent to withdraw her from thee before dawn? By the Lord, O my son, I know nothing of this affair, and Allah upon thee, tell me if it be a delusion of dreaming or a deception caused by indisposition. For verily thou layest down to sleep last night with thy mind occupied anent marriage and troubled with the talk of it (Allah damn marriage and the hour when I spake of it and curse him who counselled it!); and without doubt or diffidence I can say that being moved in mind by the mention of wedlock thou dreamedst that a handsome young lady embraced thee and didst fancy thou sawest her when awake. But all this, O my son, is but an imbroglio of dreams.\" Replied Kamar al-Zaman, \"Leave this talk and swear to me by Allah, the All creator, the Omniscient; the Humbler of the tyrant Caesars and the Destroyer of the Chosroes, that thou knowest naught of the young lady nor of her woning-place.\" Quoth the King, \"By the Might of Allah Almighty, the God of Moses and Abraham, I know naught of all this and never even heard of it; it is assuredly a delusion of dreams thou hast seen in sleep.' Then the Prince replied to his sire, \"I will give thee a self evident proof that it happened to me when on wake.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al Zamar said to his sire, \"I will give thee a self-evident proof that this happened to me when on wake. Now let me ask thee, did it ever befal any man to dream that he was battling a sore battle and after to awake from sleep and find in his hand a sword-blade besmeared with blood? Answered the King, \"No, by Allah, O my son, this hath never been.\" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman, \"I will tell thee what happened to me and it was this. Meseemed I awoke from sleep in the middle of the past night and found a girl lying by my side, whose form was like mine and whose favour was as mine. I embraced her and turned her about with my hand and took her seal- ring, which I put on my finger, and she pulled off my ring and put it on hers. Then I went to sleep by her side, but refrained from her for shame of thee, deeming that thou hadst sent her to me, intending to tempt me with her and incline me to marriage, and suspecting thee to be hidden somewhere whence thou couldst see what I did with her. And I was ashamed even to kiss her on the mouth for thy account, thinking over this temptation to wedlock; and, when I awoke at point of day, I found no trace of her, nor could I come at any news of her, and there befel me what thou knowest of with the eunuch and with the Wazir. How then can this case have been a dream and a delusion, when the ring is a reality? Save for her ring on my finger I should indeed have deemed it a dream; but here is the ring on my little finger: look at it, O King, and see what is its worth.\" So saying he handed the ring to his father, who examined it and turned it over, then looked to his son and said, \"Verily, there is in this ring some mighty mystery and some strange secret. What befel thee last night with the girl is indeed a hard nut to crack, and I know not how intruded upon us this intruder. None is the cause of all this posher save the Wazir; but, Allah upon thee, O my son, take patience, so haply the Lord may turn to gladness this thy grief and to thy sadness bring complete relief: as quoth one of the poets,\n\n'Haply shall Fortune draw her rein, and bring *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Fair chance, for she is changeful, jealous, vain:\nStill I may woo my want and wishes win, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And see on heels of care unfair, the fain.'\n\nAnd now, O my son, I am certified at this hour that thou art not mad; but thy case is a strange one which none can clear up for thee save the Almighty.\" Cried the Prince, \"By Allah, O my father, deal kindly with me and seek out this young lady and hasten her coming to me; else I shall die of woe and of my death shall no one know.\" Then he betrayed the ardour of his passion; and turned towards his father and repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"If your promise of personal call prove untrue, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Deign in vision to grant me an interview:\nQuoth they, 'How can phantom[FN#277] appear to the sight *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of a youth, whose sight is fordone, perdue?'\"\n\nThen, after ending his poetry, Kamar al-Zaman again turned to his father, with submission and despondency, and shedding tears in flood, began repeating these lines.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman had repeated to his father these verses, he wept and complained and groaned from a wounded heart; and added these lines,\n\n\"Beware that eye glance which hath magic might; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Wherever turn those orbs it bars our flight:\nNor be deceived by low sweet voice, that breeds *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    A fever festering in the heart and sprite:\nSo soft that silky skin, were rose to touch it *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     She'd cry and tear-drops rain for pain and fright:\nDid Zephyr e'en in sleep pass o'er her land, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Scented he'd choose to dwell in scented site:\nHer necklets vie with tinkling of her belt; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Her wrists strike either wristlet dumb with spite:\nWhen would her bangles buss those rings in ear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Upon the lover's eyne high mysteries 'light:\nI'm blamed for love of her, nor pardon claim; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Eyes are not profiting which lack foresight:\nHeaven strip thee, blamer mine! unjust art thou; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Before this fawn must every eye low bow.\"[FN#278]\n\nAfter which he said, \"By Allah, O my father, I cannot endure to be parted from her even for an hour.\" The King smote hand upon hand and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! No cunning contrivance can profit us in this affair.\" Then he took his son by the hand and carried him to the palace, where Kamar al-Zaman lay down on the bed of languor and the King sat at his head, weeping and mourning over him and leaving him not, night or day, till at last the Wazir came in to him and said, \"O King of the age and the time, how long wilt thou remain shut up with thy son and hide thyself from thy troops. Haply, the order of thy realm may be deranged, by reason of shine absence from thy Grandees and Officers of State. It behoveth the man of understanding, if he have various wounds in his body, to apply him first to medicine the most dangerous; so it is my counsel to thee that thou remove thy son from this place to the pavilion which is in the palace overlooking the sea; and shut thyself up with him there, setting apart in every week two days, Thursday and Monday, for state receptions and progresses and reviews. On these days let shine Emirs and Wazirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and high Officials and Grandees of the realm and the rest of the levies and the lieges have access to thee and submit their affairs to thee; and do thou their needs and judge among them and give and take with them and bid and forbid. And the rest of the week thou shalt pass with thy son, Kamar al-Zaman, and cease not thus doing till Allah shall vouchsafe relief to you twain. Think not, O King, that thou art safe from the shifts of Time and the strokes of Change which come like a traveller in the night; for the wise man is ever on his guard and how well saith the poet,\n\n'Thou deemedst well of Time when days went well, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And fearedst not what ills might bring thee Fate:\nThe Nights so fair and restful cozened thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     For peaceful Nights bring woes of heavy weight.\nOh children of mankind whom Time befriends, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Beware of Time's deceits or soon or late!'''[FN#279]\n\nWhen the Sultan heard his Wazir's words he saw that they were right and deemed his counsel wise, and it had effect upon him for he feared lest the order of the state be deranged; so he rose at once and bade transport his son from his sick room to the pavilion in the palace overlooking the sea. Now this palace was girt round by the waters and was approached by a causeway twenty cubits wide. It had windows on all sides commanding an ocean- view; its floor was paved with parti-coloured marbles and its ceiling was painted in the richest pigments and figured with gold and lapis-lazuli. They furnished it for Kamar al-Zaman with splendid upholstery, embroidered rugs and carpets of the richest silk; and they clothed the walls with choice brocades and hung curtains bespangled with gems of price. In the midst they set him a couch of juniper[FN#280]-wood inlaid with pearls and jewels, and Kamar al-Zaman sat down thereon, but the excess of his concern and passion for the young lady had wasted his charms and emaciated his body; he could neither eat nor drink nor sleep; and he was like a man who had been sick twenty years of sore sickness. His father seated himself at his head, grieving for him with the deepest grief, and every Monday and Thursday he gave his Wazirs and Emirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and Lords of the realm and levies and the rest of his lieges leave to come up to him in that pavilion. So they entered and did their several service and duties and abode with him till the end of the day, when they went their ways and the King returned to his son in the pavilion whom he left not night nor day; and he ceased not doing on this wise for many days and nights. Such was the case with Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman; but as regards Princess Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seven Palaces, when the two Jinns bore her up and laid her on her bed, she slept till daybreak, when she awoke and sitting upright looked right and left, but saw not the youth who had lain in her bosom. At this her vitals fluttered, her reason fled and she shrieked a loud shriek which awoke all her slave girls and nurses and duennas. They flocked in to her; and the chief of them came forward and asked, \"What aileth thee, O my lady?\" Answered the Princess, \"O wretched old woman, where is my beloved, the handsome youth who lay last night in my bosom? Tell me whither he is gone.\" Now when the duenna heard this, the light starkened in her sight and she feared from her mischief with sore affright, and said to her, \"O my Lady Budur, what unseemly words are these?\" Cried the Princess, \"Woe to thee pestilent crone that thou art! I ask thee again where is my beloved, the goodly youth with the shining face and the slender form, the jetty eyes and the joined eyebrows, who lay with me last night from supper-tide until near daybreak?\" She rejoined \"By Allah, O my lady, I have seen no young man nor any other. I conjure thee, carry not this unseemly jest too far lest we all lose our lives; for perhaps the joke may come to thy father's ears and who shall then deliver us from his hand?\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the duenna bespake the Lady Budur in these words, \"Allah upon thee, O my lady! carry not this unseemly jest too far; for perhaps it may come to thy father's ears, and who shall then deliver us from his hand?\" The Princess rejoined, \"In very sooth a youth lay with me last night, one of the fairest-faced of men.\" Exclaimed the duenna, \"Heaven preserve thy reason! indeed no one lay with thee last night.\" Thereupon the Princess looked at her hand and, finding Kamar al-Zaman's seal-ring on her finger in stead of her own, said to her, \"Woe to thee, thou accursed! thou traitress! wilt thou lie to me and tell me that none lay with me last night and swear to me a falsehood in the name of the Lord?\" Replied the duenna, \"By Allah, I do not lie to thee nor have I sworn falsely.\" Then the Princess was incensed by her words and, drawing a sword she had by her, she smote the old woman with it and slew her;[FN#281] whereupon the eunuch and the waiting-women and the concubines cried out at her, and ran to her father and, without stay or delay, acquainted him with her case. So the King went to her, and asked her, \"O my daughter, what aileth thee?\"; and she answered, \"O my father, where is the youth who lay with me last night?\" Then her reason fled from her head and she cast her eyes right and left and rent her raiment even to the skirt. When her sire saw this, he bade the women lay hands on her; so they seized her and manacled her, then putting a chain of iron about her neck, made her fast to one of the palace-windows and there left her.[FN#282] Thus far concerning Princess Budur; but as regards her father, King Ghayur, the world was straitened upon him when he saw what had befallen his daughter, for that he loved her and her case was not a little grievous to him. So he summoned on it the doctors and astrologers and men skilled in talisman- writing and said to them, \"Whoso healeth my daughter of what ill she hath, I will marry him to her and give him half of my kingdom; but whoso cometh to her and cureth her not, I will strike off his head and hang it over her palace-gate.\" Accordingly, all who went in to her, but failed to heal her, he beheaded and hung their heads over the palace-gates, till he had beheaded on her account forty doctors and crucified forty astrologers; wherefor the general held aloof from her, all the physicians having failed to medicine her malady; and her case was a puzzle to the men of science and the adepts in cabalistic characters. And as her longing and passion redoubled and love and distraction were sore upon her, she poured forth tears and repeated these couplets,\n\n\"My fondness, O my moon, for thee my foeman is, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to thy comradeship the nights my thought compel:\nIn gloom I bide with fire that flames below my ribs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose lowe I make comparison with heat of Hell:\nI'm plagued with sorest stress of pine and ecstasy; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor clearest noon tide can that horrid pain dispel.\"\n\nThen she sighed and repeated these also,\n\n\"Salams fro' me to friends in every stead; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Indeed to all dear friends do I incline:\nSalams, but not salams that bid adieu; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Salams that growth of good for you design:\nI love you dear, indeed, nor less your land, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But bide I far from every need of mine!\"\n\nAnd when the Lady Budur ceased repeating her poetry, she wept till her eyes waxed sore and her cheeks changed form and hue, and in this condition she continued three years. Now she had a foster-brother, by name Marzaw\u00e1n,[FN#283] who was travelling in far lands and absent from her the whole of this time. He loved her with an exceeding love, passing the love of brothers; so when he came back he went in to his mother and asked for his sister, the Princess Budur. She answered him, \"O my son, thy sister hath been smitten with madness and hath passed these three years with a chain of iron about her neck; and all the physicians and men of science have failed of healing her.\" When Marzawan heard these words he said, \"I must needs go in to her; peradventure I may discover what she hath, and be able to medicine her;\" and his mother replied, \"Needs must thou visit her, but wait till to morrow, that I may contrive some thing to suit thy case.\" Then she went a-foot to the palace of the Lady Budur and, accosting the eunuch in charge of the gates, made him a present and said to him, \"I have a daughter, who was brought up with thy mistress and since then I married her; and, when that befel the Princess which befel her, she became troubled and sore concerned, and I desire of thy favour that my daughter may go in to her for an hour and look on her; and then return whence she came, so shall none know of it.\" Quoth the eunuch, \"This may not be except by night, after the King hath visited his child and gone away; then come thou and thy daughter.\" So she kissed the eunuch's hand and, returning home, waited till the morrow at nightfall; and when it was time she arose and sought her son Marzawan and attired him in woman's apparel; then, taking his hand in hers, led him towards the palace, and ceased not walking with him till she came upon the eunuch after the Sultan had ended his visit to the Princess. Now when the eunuch saw her, he rose to her, and said, \"Enter, but do not prolong thy stay!\" So they went in and when Marzawan beheld the Lady Budur in the aforesaid plight, he saluted her, after his mother had doffed his woman's garb: then he took out of their satchel books he had brought with him; and, lighting a wax- candle, he began to recite certain conjurations Thereupon the Princess looked at him and recognising him, said, \"O my brother, thou hast been absent on thy travels' and thy news have been cut off from us.\" He replied, \"True! but Allah hath brought me back safe and sound, I am now minded to set out again nor hath aught delayed me but the news I hear of thee; wherefore my heart burned for thee and I came to thee, so haply I may free thee of thy malady.\" She rejoined, O my brother, thinkest thou it is madness aileth me?\" \"Yes.\" answered he, and she said, \"Not so, by Allah! 'tis even as saith the poet,\n\n'Quoth they 'Thou rav'st on him thou lov'st': quoth I, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'The sweets of love are only for th' insane!'\nLove never maketh Time his friend befriend; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Only the Jinn-struck wight such boon can gain:\nWell! yes, I'm mad: bring him who madded me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And, if he cure m: madness, blame restrain!'\"\n\nThen she let Marzawan know that she was love-daft and he said \"Tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee: haply there may be in my hand something which shall be a means of deliverance for thee.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of da, and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Marzawar thus addressed Princess Budur, \"Tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee: haply Allah may inspire me with a means of deliverance for thee.\" Quoth she, \"O my brother, hear my story which is this. One night I awoke from sleep, in the last third of the night[FN#284] and, sitting up, saw by my side the handsomest of youths that be, and tongue faileth to describe him, for he was as a willow-wand or an Indian rattan-cane. So methought it was my father who had done on this wise in order thereby to try me, for that he had consulted me concerning wedlock, when the Kings sought me of him to wife, and I had refused. It was this though withheld me from arousing him, for I feared that, if I did aught of embraced him, he would peradventure inform my father of m, doings. But in the morning, I found on my finger his seal-ring, in place of my own which he had taken. And, O my brother, m, heart was seized with love of him at first sight; and, for the violence of my passion and longing, I have never savoured the taste of sleep and have no occupation save weeping alway and repeating verses night and day. And this, O my brother, is my story and the cause of my madness.\" Then she poured forth tears and repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Now Love hast banished all that bred delight; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With that heart-nibbling fawn my joys took flight:\nLightest of trifles lover's blood to him *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who wastes the vitals of the hapless wight!\nFor him I'm jealous of my sight and thought; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My heart acts spy upon my thought and sight:\nThose long-lashed eyelids rain on me their shafts *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Guileful, destroying hearts where'er they light:\nNow, while my portion in the world endures, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall I behold him ere I quit world-site?\nWhat bear I for his sake I'd hide, but tears *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Betray my feelings to the spy's despight.\nWhen near, our union seemeth ever far; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When far, my thoughts to him aye nearest are.\"\n\nAnd presently she continued, \"See then, O my brother, how thou mayest aid me in mine affliction.\" So Marzawan bowed his head ground-wards awhile, wondering and not knowing what to do, then he raised it and said to her, \"All thou hast spoken to me I hold to be true, though the case of the young man pass my understanding: but I will go round about all lands and will seek for what may heal thee; haply Allah shall appoint thy healing to be at my hand. Meanwhile, take patience and be not disquieted.\" Thereupon Marzawan farewelled her, praying that she might be constant and left her repeating these couplets,\n\n\"Thine image ever companies my sprite, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    For all thou'rt distant from the pilgrim's sight:\nBut my heart-wishes e'er attract thee near: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    What is the lightning's speed to Thought's swift flight?\nThen go not thou, my very light of eyes *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which, when thou'rt gone, lack all the Kohl of light.\"\n\nThen Marzawan returned to his mother's house, where he passed the night. And when the morrow dawned, having equipped himself for his journey, he fared forth and ceased not faring from city to city and from island to island for a whole month, till he came to a town named Al-Tayrab.[FN#285] Here he went about scenting news of the townsfolk, so haply he might light on a cure for the Princess's malady, for in every capital he entered or passed by, it was reported that Queen Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, had lost her wits. But arriving at Al-Tayrab city, he heard that Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman, was fallen sick and afflicted with melancholy madness. So Marzawan asked the name of the Prince's capital and they said to him, \"It is on the Islands of Khalidan and it lieth distant from our city a whole month's journey by sea, but by land it is six months' march.\" So he went down to the sea in a ship which was bound for the Khalidan Isles, and she sailed with a favouring breeze for a whole month, till they came in sight of the capital; and there remained for them but to make the land when, behold, there came out on them a tempestuous wind which carried away the masts and rent the canvas, so that the sails fell into the sea and the ship capsized, with all on board,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the ship capsized with all on board, each sought his own safety; and as for Marzawan the set of the sea carried him under the King's palace, wherein was Kamar al-Zaman. And by the decree of destiny it so happened that this was the day on which King Shahriman gave audience to his Grandees and high officers, and he was sitting, with his son's head on his lap, whilst an eunuch fanned away the flies; and the Prince had not spoken neither had he eaten nor drunk for two days, and he was grown thinner than a spindle.[FN#286] Now the Wazir was standing respectfully a-foot near the latticed window giving on the sea and, raising his eyes, saw Marzawan being beaten by the billows and at his last gasp; whereupon his heart was moved to pity for him, so he drew near to the King and moving his head towards him said, \"I crave thy leave, O King, to go down to the court of the pavilion and open the water-gate that I may rescue a man who is at the point of drowning in the sea and bring him forth of danger into deliverance; peradventure, on this account Allah may free thy son from what he hath!\" The King replied, \"O thou Wazir, enough is that which hath befallen my son through thee and on shine account. Haply, if thou rescue this drowning man, he will come to know our affairs, and look on my son who is in this state and exult over me; but I swear by Allah, that if this half-drowned wretch come hither and learn our condition and look upon my son and then fare forth and speak of our secrets to any, I will assuredly strike off thy head before his; for thou, O my Minister art the cause of all that hath betided us, first and last. Now do as thou wilt.\" Thereupon the Wazir sprang up and, opening the private pastern which gave upon the sea, descended to the causeway; then walked on twenty steps and came to the water where he saw Marzawan nigh unto death. So he put out his hand to him and, catching him by his hair, drew him ashore in a state of insensibility, with belly full of water and eyes half out of his head. The Wazir waited till he came to himself, when he pulled off his wet clothes and clad him in a fresh suit, covering his head with one of his servants' turbands; after which he said to him, Know that I have been the means of saving thee from drowning: do not thou requite me by causing my death and shine own.\"\u00c4And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir did to Marzawan what he did, he thus addressed him Know that I have been the cause of saving thee from drowning so requite me not by causing my death and shine own.\" Asked Marzawan, And how so?\"; and the Wazir answered, \"Thou art at this hour about to go up and pass among Emirs and Wazirs all of them silent and none speaking, because of Kamar al-Zaman the son of the Sultan.\" Now when Marzawan heard the name of Kamar al-Zaman, he knew that this was he whom he had heard spoken of in sundry cities and of whom he came in search, but he feigned ignorance and asked the Wazir, \"And who is Kamar al-Zaman? Answered the Minister, \"He is the son of Sultan Shahriman and he is sore sick and lieth strown on his couch restless alway, eating not nor drinking neither sleeping night or day; indeed he is nigh upon death and we have lost hope of his living and are certain that he is dying. Beware lest thou look too long on him, or thou look on any other than that where thou settest thy feet: else thou art a lost man, and I also.\" He replied, \"Allah upon thee, O Wazir, I implore thee, of thy favour, acquaint me touching this youth thou describest, what is the cause of the condition in which he is.\" The Wazir replied, \"I know none, save that, three years ago, his father required him to wed, but he refused; whereat the King was wroth and imprisoned him. And when he awoke on the morrow, he fancied that during the night he had been roused from sleep and had seen by his side a young lady of passing loveliness, whose charms tongue can never express; and he assured us that he had plucked off her seal-ring from her finger and had put it on his own and that she had done likewise; but we know not the secret of all this business. So by Allah, O my son, when thou comest up with me into the palace, look not on the Prince, but go thy way; for the Sultan's heart is full of wrath against me.\" So said Marzawan to himself, \"By Allah; this is the one I sought!\" Then he followed the Wazir up to the palace, where the Minister seated himself at the Prince's feet; but Marzawan found forsooth nothing to do but go up to Kamar al-Zaman and stand before him at gaze. Upon this the Wazir, died of affright in his skin, and kept looking at Marzawan and signalling him to wend his way; but he feigned not to see him and gave not over gazing upon Kamar al- Zaman, till he was well assured that it was indeed he whom he was seeking,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Marzawan looked upon Kamar al-Zaman and knew that it was indeed he whom he was seeking, he cried, \"Exalted be Allah, Who hath made his shape even as her shape and his complexion as her complexion and his cheek as her cheek!'' Upon this Kamar al-Zaman opened his eyes and gave earnest ear to his speech; and, when Marzawan saw him inclining to hear, he repeated these couplets[FN#287],\n\n\"I see thee full of song and plaint and love's own ecstasy;\nDelighting in describing all the charms of loveliness:\n\nArt smit by stroke of Love or hath shaft-shot wounded thee?\nNone save the wounded ever show such signals of distress!\nHo thou! crown the wine cup and sing me singular\nPraises to Sulaym\u00e1, Al-Rab\u00e1b, Tan'oum addrest;[FN#288]\n\nGo round the grape-vine sun[FN#289] which for mansion hath a jar;\nWhose East the cup boy is, and here my mouth that opes for West.\n\nI'm jealous of the very clothes that dare her sides enroll\nWhen she veils her dainty body of the delicatest grace:\n\nI envy every goblet of her lips that taketh toll\nWhen she sets the kissing cup on that sweetest kissing-place.\n\nBut deem not by the keen-edged scymitar I'm slain\u2014\nThe hurts and harms I dree are from arrows of her eyes.\n\nI found her finger tips, as I met her once again,\nDeep-reddened with the juice of the wood that ruddy dyes;[FN#290]\n\nAnd cried, 'Thy palms thou stainedst when far away was I\nAnd this is how thou payest one distracted by his pine!'\n\nQuoth she (enkindling in my heart a flame that burned high\nSpeaking as one who cannot hide of longing love the sign),\n\n'By thy life, this is no dye used for dyeing; so forbear\nThy blame, nor in charging me with falsing Love persist!\n\nBut when upon our parting-day I saw thee haste to fare,\n\nThe while were bared my hand and my elbow and my wrist;\n\n'I shed a flood of blood-red tears and with fingers brushed away; Hence blood-reddened were the tips and still blood-red they remain.'\n\nHad I wept before she wept, to my longing-love a prey,\nBefore repentance came, I had quit my soul of pain;\n\nBut she wept before I wept and I wept to see her care\nAnd I said, 'All the merit to precedent;'[FN#291]\n\nBlame me not for loving her, now on self of Love I swear\nFor her sake, for her only, these pains my soul torment.\n\nShe hath all the lere of Lukm\u00e1n[FN#292] and Y\u00fasuf's beauty lief;\nSweet singer David's voice and Maryam's chastity:\n\nWhile I've all Jacob's mourning and Jonah's prison-grief,\nAnd the sufferings of Job and old Adam's history:\n\nYet kill her not, albeit of my love for her I die;\nBut ask her why my blood to her was lawful. ask her why?\"\n\nWhen Marzawan recited this ode, the words fell upon Kamar al- Zaman's heart as freshness after fever and returning health; and he sighed and, turning his tongue in his mouth, said to his sire, \"O my father, let this youth come and sit by my side.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to his sire, \"O my father, allow this youth to come and sit by my side.\" Now when the King heard these words from his son, he rejoiced with exceeding joy, though at the first his heart had been set against Marzawan and he had determined that the stranger's head needs must be stricken off: but when he heard Kamar al-Zaman speak, his anger left him and he arose and drawing Marzawan to him, seated him by his son and turning to him said, \"Praised be Allah for thy safety!\" He replied, \"Allah preserve thee! and preserve thy son to thee!\" and called down blessings on the King. Then the King asked, \"From what country art thou?\"; and he answered, \"From the Islands of the Inland Sea, the kingdom of King Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seas and the Seven Palaces.\" Quoth King Shahriman, \"Maybe thy coming shall be blessed to my son and Allah vouchsafe to heal what is in him.\" Quoth Marzawan, \"Inshallah, naught shall be save what shall be well!\" Then turning to Kamar al-Zaman, he said to him in his ear unheard of the King and his court, 'O my lord! be of good cheer, and hearten thy heart and let shine eyes be cool and clear and, with respect to her for whose sake thou art thus, ask not of her case on shine account. But thou keptest thy secret and fellest sick, while she told her secret and they said she had gone mad; so she is now in prison, with an iron chain about her neck, in most piteous plight; but, Allah willing, the healing of both of you shall come from my hand.\" Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, his life returned to him and he took heart and felt a thrill of joy and signed to his father to help him sit up; and the King was like to fly for gladness and rose hastily and lifted him up. Presently, of his fear for his son, he shook the kerchief of dismissal[FN#293]; and all the Emirs and Wazirs withdrew; then he set two pillows for his son to lean upon, after which he bade them perfume the palace with saffron and decorate the city, saying to Marzawan, \"By Allah, O my son, of a truth shine aspect be a lucky and a blessed!\" And he made as much of him as he might and called for food, and when they brought it, Marzawan came up to the Prince and said, \"Rise, eat with me.\" So he obeyed him and ate with him, and all the while the King invoked blessings on Marzawan and said, \"How auspicious is thy coming, O my son!\" And when the father saw his boy eat, his joy and gladness redoubled, and he went out and told the Prince's mother and all the household. Then he spread throughout the palace the good news of the Prince's recovery and the King commanded the decoration of the city and it was a day of high festival. Marzawan passed that night with Kamar al-Zaman, and the King also slept with them in joy and delight for his son's recovery.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Shahriman also passed that night with them in the excess of his joy for his son's recovery. And when the next morning dawned, and the King had gone away and the two young men were left alone, Kamar al-Zaman told his story from beginning to end to Marzawan who said, \"In very sooth I know her with whom thou didst foregather; her name is the Princess Budur and she is daughter to King Ghayur.\" Then he related to him all that had passed with the Princess from first to last and acquainted him with the excessive love she bore him, saying, \"All that befel thee with thy father hath befallen her with hers, and thou art without doubt her beloved, even as she is shine; so brace up thy resolution and take heart, for I will bring thee to her and unite you both anon and deal with you even as saith the poet,\n\n\"Albe to lover adverse be his love, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And show aversion howso may he care;\nYet will I manage that their persons[FN#294] meet, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     E'en as the pivot of a scissor pair.\"\n\nAnd he ceased not to comfort and solace and encourage Kamar al- Zaman and urged him to eat and drink till he ate food and drank wine, and life returned to him and he was saved from his ill case; and Marzawan cheered him and diverted him with talk and songs and stories, and in good time he became free of his disorder and stood up and sought to go to the Hammam.[FN#295] So Marzawan took him by the hand and both went to the bath, where they washed their bodies and made them clean.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundredth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman, went to the Hammam, his father in his joy at this event freed the prisoners, and presented splendid dresses to his grandees and bestowed large alm-gifts upon the poor and bade decorate the city seven days. Then quoth Marzawan to Kamar al-Zaman, \"Know, O my lord, that I came not from the Lady Budur save for this purpose, and the object of my journey was to deliver her from her present case; and it remaineth for us only to devise how we may get to her, since thy father cannot brook the thought of parting from thee. So it is my counsel that to-morrow thou ask his leave to go abroad hunting. Then do thou take with thee a pair of saddle-bags full of money and mount a swift steed, and lead a spare horse, and I will do the like, and say to thy sire, 'I have a mind to divert myself with hunting the desert and to see the open country and there to pass one night.' Suffer not any servant to follow us, for as soon as we reach the open country, we will go our ways.\" Kamar al- Zaman rejoiced in this plan with great joy and cried, \"It is good.\" Then he stiffened his back and, going in to his father, sought his leave and spoke as he had been taught, and the King consented to his going forth a-hunting and said, \"O my son, blessed be the day that restoreth thee to health! I will not gainsay thee in this; but pass not more than one night in the desert and return to me on the morrow; for thou knowest that life is not good to me without thee, and indeed I can hardly believe thee to be wholly recovered from what thou hadst,[FN#296] because thou art to me as he of whom quoth the poet,\n\n'Albe by me I had through day and night *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Solomon's carpet and the Chosroes' might,\nBoth were in value less than wing of gnat, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unless these eyne could hold thee aye in sight.'\"[FN#297]\n\nThen the King equipped his son Kamar al-Zaman and Marzawan for the excursion, bidding make ready for them four horses, together with a dromedary to carry the money and a camel to bear the water and belly timber; and Kamar al-Zaman forbade any of his attendants to follow him. His father farewelled him and pressed him to his breast and kissed him, saying, \"I ask thee in the name of Allah, be not absent from me more than one night, wherein sleep will be unlawful to me, for I am even as saith the poet,\n\n'Thou present, in the Heaven of heavens I dwell; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Bearing shine absence is of hells my Hell:\nPledged be for thee my soul! If love for thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Be crime, my crime is of the fellest fell.\nDoes love-lowe burn thy heart as burns it mine, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Doomed night and day Gehenna-fire to smell?'\"\n\nAnswered Kamar al-Zaman, \"O my father, Inshallah, I will lie abroad but one night!\" Then he took leave of him, and he and Marzawan mounted and leading the spare horses, the dromedary with the money and the camel with the water and victual, turned their faces towards the open country;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawning day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and First Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman and Marzawan fared forth and turned their faces towards the open country; and they travelled from the first of the day till nightfall, when they halted and ate and drank and fed their beasts and rested awhile; after which they again took horse and ceased not journeying for three days, and on the fourth they came to a spacious tract wherein was a thicket. They alighted in it and Marzawan, taking the camel and one of the horses, slaughtered them and cut off their flesh and stripped their bones. Then he doffed from Kamar al-Zaman his shirt and trousers which he smeared with the horse's blood and he took the Prince's coat which he tore to shreds and befouled with gore; and he cast them down in the fork of the road. Then they ate and drank and mounting set forward again; and, when Kamar al- Zaman asked why this was done, and said, \"What is this O my brother, and how shall it profit us?\"; Marzawan replied, \"Know that thy father, when we have outstayed the second night after the night for which we had his leave, and yet we return not, will mount and follow in our track till he come hither; and, when he happeneth upon this blood which I have spilt and he seeth thy shirt and trousers rent and gore-fouled, he will fancy that some accident befel thee from bandits or wild-beasts, so he will give up hope of thee and return to his city, and by this device we shall win our wishes.\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"By Allah, this be indeed a rare device! Thou hast done right well.''[FN#298] Then the two fared on days and nights and all that while Kamar al-Zaman did naught but complain when he found himself alone, and he ceased not weeping till they drew near their journeys end, when he rejoiced and repeated these verses,\n\n\"Wilt tyrant play with truest friend who thinks of thee each\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     hour, * And after showing love-desire betray indifference?\nMay I forfeit every favour if in love I falsed thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     If thee I left, abandon me by way of recompense:\nBut I've been guilty of no crime such harshness to deserve, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And if I aught offended thee I bring my penitence;\nOf Fortune's wonders one it is thou hast abandoned me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Fortune never wearieth of showing wonderments.\"\n\nWhen he had made an end of his verses, Marzawan said to him, \"Look! these be King Ghayur's Islands;\" whereat Kamar al-Zaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what he had done, and kissed him between the eyes and strained him\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Marzawan said \"Look! these be the Islands of King Ghayur;\" Kamar al-Zaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what he had done and kissed him between the eyes and strained him to his bosom. And after reaching the Islands and entering the city they took up their lodging in a khan, where they rested three days from the fatigues of their wayfare; after which Marzawan carried Kamar al-Zaman to the bath and, clothing him in merchant's gear, provided him with a geomantic tablet of gold,[FN#299] with a set of astrological instruments and with an astrolabe of silver, plated with gold. Then he said to him, \"Arise, O my lord, and take thy stand under the walls of the King's palace and cry out, 'I am the ready Reckoner; I am the Scrivener; I am he who weeteth the Sought and the Seeker; I am the finished man of Science; I am the Astrologer accomplished in experience! Where then is he that seeketh?' As soon as the King heareth this, he will send after thee and carry thee in to his daughter the Princess Budur, thy lover; but when about going in to her do thou say to him, 'Grant me three days' delay, and if she recover, give her to me to wife; and if not, deal with me as thou dealest with those who forewent me.' He will assuredly agree to this, so as soon as thou art alone with her, discover thyself to her; and when she seeth thee, she will recover strength and her madness will cease from her and she will be made whole in one night. Then do thou give her to eat and drink. and her father, rejoicing in her recovery, will marry thee to her and share his kingdom with thee; for he hath imposed on himself this condition and so peace be upon thee.\" Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words he exclaimed, \"May I never lack thy benefits!\", and, taking the set of instruments aforesaid, sallied forth from the caravanserai in the dress of his order. He walked on till he stood under the walls of King Ghayur's palace, where he began to cry out, saying, \"I am the Scribe, I am the ready Reckoner, I am he who knoweth the Sought and the Seeker; I am he who openeth the Volume and summeth up the Sums;[FN#300] who Dreams can expound whereby the sought is found! Where then is the seeker?\" Now when the city people heard this, they flocked to him, for it was long since they had seen Scribe or Astrologer, and they stood round him and, looking upon him, they saw one in the prime of beauty and grace and perfect elegance, and they marvelled at his loveliness, and his fine stature and symmetry. Presently one of them accosted him and said, \"Allah upon thee, O thou fair and young, with the eloquent tongue! incur not this affray; nor throw thy life away in thine ambition to marry the Princess Budur. Only cast shine eyes upon yonder heads hung up; all their owners have lost their lives in this same venture.\" Yet Kamar al-Zaman paid no heed to them, but cried out at the top of his voice, saying, \"I am the Doctor, the Scrivener! I am the Astrologer, the Calculator!\" And all the townsfolk forbade him from this, but he regarded them not at all, saying in his mind, \"None knoweth desire save whoso suffereth it.\" Then he began again to cry his loudest, shouting, \"I am the Scrivener, I am the Astrologer!\"\u2014And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman in no wise heeded the words of the citizens, but continued to cry out, \"I am the Calculator! I am the Astrologer!\" Thereupon all the townsfolk were wroth with him and said to him, \"Thou art nothing but an imbecile, silly, self-willed lad! Have pity on shine own youth and tender years and beauty and loveliness.\" But he cried all the more, \"I am the Astrologer, I am the Calculator! Is there any one that seeketh?\" As he was thus crying and the people forbidding him, behold, King Ghayur heard his voice and the clamour of the lieges and said to his Wazir, \"Go down and bring me yon Astrologer.\" So the Wazir, went down in haste, and taking Kamar al-Zaman from the midst of the crowd led him up to the King; and when in the presence he kissed the ground and began versifying,\n\n\"Eight glories meet, all, all conjoined in thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whereby may Fortune aye thy servant be:\nLere, lordliness, grace, generosity; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Plain words, deep meaning, honour, victory!\"\n\nWhen the King looked upon him, he seated him by his side and said to him, \"By Allah, O my son, an thou be not an astrologer, venture not thy life nor comply with my condition; for I have bound myself that whoso goeth in to my daughter and healeth her not of that which hath befallen her I will strike off his head; but whoso healeth her him I will marry to her. So let not thy beauty and loveliness delude thee: for, by Allah! and again, by Allah! If thou cure her not, I will assuredly cut off thy head.\" And Kamar al-Zaman replied, \"This is thy right; and I consent, for I wot of this ere came I hither.\" Then King Ghayur took the Kazis to witness against him and delivered him to the eunuch, saying, \"Carry this one to the Lady Budur.\" So the eunuch took him by the hand and led him along the passage; but Kamar al-Zaman outstripped him and pushed on before, whilst the eunuch ran after him, saying, \"Woe to thee! Hasten not to shine own ruin: never yet saw I astrologer so eager for his proper destruction; but thou weetest not what calamities are before thee.\" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman turned away his face from the eunuch,\u2014And Shah razed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the eunuch thus addressed Kamar al-Zaman, \"Patience, and no indecent hurry!\"; the Prince turned away his face and began repeating these couplets,\n\n\"A Sage, I feel a fool before thy charms; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Distraught, I wot not what the words I say:\nIf say I 'Sun,' away thou dost not pass *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From eyes of me, while suns go down with day:\nThou hast completed Beauty, in whose praise *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Speech-makers fail, and talkers lose their way.\"\n\nThen the eunuch stationed Kamar al-Zaman behind the curtain of the Princess's door and the Prince said to him, \"Which of the two ways will please thee more, treat and cure thy lady from here or go in and heal her within the curtain?\" The eunuch marvelled at his words and answered, \"An thou heal her from here it were better proof of thy skill.\" Upon this Kamar al-Zaman sat down behind the curtain and, taking out ink case, pen and paper, wrote the following: \"This is the writ of one whom passion swayeth,* and whom longing waylayeth * and wakeful misery slayeth * one who despaireth of living * and looketh for naught but dying * with whose mourning heart * nor comforter nor helper taketh part * One whose sleepless eyes * none succoureth from anxieties * whose day is passed in fire * and his night in torturing desire * whose body is wasted for much emaciation * and no messenger from his beloved bringeth him consolation.\" And after this he indited the following couplets,\n\n\"I write with heart devoted to thy thought, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And eyelids chafed by tears of blood they bled;\nAnd body clad, by loving pine and pain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In shirt of leanness, and worn down to thread,\nTo thee complain I of Love's tormentry, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which ousted hapless Patience from her stead:\nA toi! show favour and some mercy deign, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     For Passion's cruel hands my vitals shred.\"\n\nAnd beneath his lines he wrote these cadenced sentences, \"The heart's pain is removed * by union with the beloved * and whomso his lover paineth * only Allah assaineth! * If we or you have wrought deceit * may the deceiver win defeat! * There is naught goodlier than a lover who keeps faith * with the beloved who works him scathe.\" Then, by way of subscription, he wrote, \"From the distracted and despairing man * whom love and longing trepan * from the lover under passion's ban * the prisoner of transport and distraction * from this Kamar al-Zaman * son of Shahriman * to the peerless one * of the fair Houris the pearl-union * to the Lady Budur * daughter of King Al Ghayur * Know thou that by night I am sleepless * and by day in distress * consumed with increasing wasting and pain * and longing and love unfain * abounding in sighs * with tear flooded eyes * by passion captive ta'en * of Desire the slain * with heart seared by the parting of us twain * the debtor of longing bane, of sickness cup-companion * I am the sleepless one, who never closeth eye * the slave of love, whose tears run never dry * for the fire of my heart is still burning * and never hidden is the flame of my yearning.\" Then on the margin Kamar al-Zaman wrote this admired verse,\n\n\"Salem from graces hoarded by my Lord *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To her, who holds my heart and soul in hoard!\"\n\nAnd also these,\n\n\"Pray'ee grant me some words from your lips, belike *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Such mercy may comfort and cool these eyne:\nFrom the stress of my love and my pine for you, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I make light of what makes me despised, indign:\nAllah guard a folk whose abode was far, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And whose secret I kept in the holiest shrine:\nNow Fortune in kindness hath favoured me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thrown on threshold dust of this love o' mine:\nBy me bedded I looked on Bud\u00far, whose sun *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The moon of my fortunes hath made to shine.\"\n\nThen, having affixed his seal-ring to the missive, he wrote these couplets in the place of address,\n\n\"Ask of my writ what wrote my pen in dole, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And hear my tale of misery from this scroll;\nMy hand is writing while my tears down flow, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to the paper 'plains my longing soul:\nMy tears cease not to roll upon this sheet, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And if they stopped I'd cause blood-gouts to roll.\"\n\nAnd at the end he added this other verse,\n\n\"I've sent the ring from off thy finger bore *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   I when we met, now deign my ring restore!\"\n\nThen Kamar al-Zaman set the Lady Budur's ring inside the letter and sealed it and gave it to the eunuch, who took it and went in with it to his mistress.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman, after setting the seal-ring inside the epistle, gave it to the eunuch who took it and went in with it to his mistress; and, when the Lady Budur opened it, she found therein her own very ring. Then she read the paper and when she understood its purport and knew that it was from her beloved, and that he in person stood behind the curtain, her reason began to fly and her breast swelled for joy and rose high; and she repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Long, long have I bewailed the sev'rance of our loves, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With tears that from my lids streamed down like burning\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     rain;\nAnd vowed that, if the days deign reunite us two, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My lips should never speak of severance again:\nJoy hath o'erwhelmed me so that, for the very stress *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of that which gladdens me to weeping I am fain.\nTears are become to you a habit, O my eyes, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So that ye weep as well for gladness as for pain.''[FN#301]\n\nAnd having finished her verse, the Lady Budur stood up forthwith and, firmly setting her feet to the wall, strained with all her might upon the collar of iron, till she brake it from her neck and snapped the chains. Then going forth from behind the curtain she threw herself on Kamar al-Zaman and kissed him on the mouth, like a pigeon feeding its young.[FN#302] And she embraced him with all the stress of her love and longing and said to him, \"O my lord do I wake or sleep and hath the Almighty indeed vouchsafe] us reunion after disunion? Laud be to Allah who hath our loves repaired, even after we despaired!\" Now when the eunuch saw her in this case, he went off running to King Ghayur and, kissing the ground before him, said, \"O my lord, know that this Astrologer is indeed the Shaykh of all astrologers, who are fools to him, all of them; for verily he hath cured thy daughter while standing behind the curtain and without going in to her.\" Quoth the King, \"Look well to it, is this news true?\" Answered the eunuch, \"O my lord, rise and come and see for thyself how she hath found strength to break the iron chains and is come forth to the Astrologer, kissing and embracing him.\" Thereupon the King arose and went in to his daughter who, when she saw him, stood up in haste and covered her head,[FN#303] and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"The toothstick love I not; for when I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Siw\u00e1k,'[FN#304] I miss thee, for it sounds 'Siw\u00e1-ka'.\nThe caper-tree I love; for when I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Ar\u00e1k'[FN#305] it sounds I look on thee, 'Ar\u00e1-ka.'\"\n\nThereupon the King was so transported for joy at her recovery that he felt like to fly and kissed her between the eyes, for he loved her with dearest love; then, turning to Kamar al-Zaman, he asked him who he was, and said, \"What countryman art thou?\" So the Prince told him his name and rank, and informed him that he was the son of King Shahriman, and presently related to him the whole story from beginning to end; and acquainted him with what happened between himself and the Lady Budur; and how he had taken her seal-ring from her finger and had placed it on his own; whereat Ghayur marvelled and said, \"Verily your story deserveth in books to be chronicled, and when you are dead and gone age after age be read.\" Then he summoned Kazis and witnesses forthright and married the Lady Budur to Prince Kamar al-Zaman; after which he bade decorate the city seven days long. So they spread the tables with all manner of meats, whilst the drums beat and the criers anounced the glad tidings, and all the troops donned their richest clothes; and they illuminated the city and held high festival. Then Kamar al-Zaman went in to the Lady Budur and the King rejoiced in her recovery and in her marriage; and praised Allah for that He had made her to fall in love with a goodly youth of the sons of Kings. So they unveiled her and displayed the bride before the bridegroom; and both were the living likeness of each other in beauty and comeliness and grace and love-allurement. Then Kamar al-Zaman lay with her that night and took his will of her, whilst she in like manner fulfilled her desire of him and enjoyed his charms and grace; and they slept in each other's arms till the morning. On the morrow, the King made a wedding-feast to which he gathered all comers from the Islands of the Inner and Outer Seas, and he spread the tables with choicest viands nor ceased the banquetting for a whole month. Now when Kamar al-Zaman had thus fulfilled his will and attained his inmost desire, and whenas he had tarried awhile with the Princess Budur, he bethought him of his father, King Shahriman, and saw him in a dream, saying, \"O my son, is it thus thou dealest with me?\" and recited in the vision these two couplets,\n\n\"Indeed to watch the darkness-moon he blighted me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to star-gaze through longsome night he plighted me:\nEasy, my heart! for haply he'll unite with thee; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And patience, Sprite! with whatso ills he dight to thee.\"\n\nNow after seeing his father in the dream and hearing his re preaches, Kamar al-Zaman awoke in the morning, afflicted and troubled, whereupon the Lady Budur questioned him and he told her what he had seen.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman acquainted the Lady Budur with what he had seen in his dream, she and he went in to her sire and, telling him what had passed, besought his leave to travel. He gave the Prince the permission he sought; but the Princess said, \"O my father, I cannot bear to be parted from him.\" Quoth Ghayur, her sire, \"Then go thou with him,\" and gave her leave to be absent a whole twelvemonth and afterwards to visit him in every year once; so she kissed his hand and Kamar al-Zaman did the like. Thereupon King Ghayur proceeded to equip his daughter and her bridegroom for the journey, and furnished them with outfit and appointments for the march; and brought out of his stables horses marked with his own brand, blood-dromedaries[FN#306] which can journey ten days without water, and prepared a litter for his daughter, besides loading mules and camels with victual; moreover, he gave them slaves and eunuchs to serve them and all manner of travellinggear; and on the day of departure, when King Ghayur took leave of Kamar al-Zaman, he bestowed on him ten splendid suits of cloth of gold embroidered with stones of price, together with ten riding horses and ten she-camels, and a treasury of money;[FN#307] and he charged him to love and cherish his daughter the Lady Budur. Then the King accompanied them to the farthest limits of his Islands where, going in to his daughter Budur in the litter, he kissed her and strained her to his bosom, weeping and repeating,\n\n\"O thou who wooest Severance, easy fare! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     For love-embrace belongs to lover-friend:\nFare softly! Fortune's nature falsehood is, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And parting shall love's every meeting end.\"\n\nThen leaving his daughter, he went to her husband and bade him farewell and kissed him; after which he parted from them and, giving the order for the march he returned to his capital with his troops. The Prince and Princess and their suite fared on without stopping through the first day and the second and the third and the fourth, nor did they cease faring for a whole month till they came to a spacious champaign, abounding in pasturage, where they pitched their tents; and they ate and drank and rested, and the Princess Budur lay down to sleep. Presently, Kamar al-Zaman went in to her and found her lying asleep clad in a shift of apricot-coloured silk that showed all and everything; and on her head was a coif of gold-cloth embroidered with pearls and jewels. The breeze raised her shift which laid bare her navel and showed her breasts and displayed a stomach whiter than snow, each one of whose dimples would contain an ounce of benzoin- ointment.[FN#308] At this sight, his love and longing redoubled, and he began reating,\n\n\"An were it asked me when by hell-fire burnt, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When flames of heart my vitals hold and hem,\n'Which wouldst thou chose, say wouldst thou rather them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Or drink sweet cooling draught?' I'd answer, 'Them!' \"\n\nThen he put his hand to the band of her petticoat-trousers and drew it and loosed it, for his soul lusted after her, when he saw a jewel, red as dye-wood, made fast to the band. He untied it and examined it and, seeing two lines of writing graven thereon, in a character not to be read, marvelled and said in his mind, \"Were not this bezel something to her very dear she had not bound it to her trousers-band nor hidden it in the most privy and precious place about her person, that she might not be parted from it. Would I knew what she cloth with this and what is the secret that is in it.\" So saying, he took it and went outside the tent to look at it in the light,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when he took the bezel to look at it in the light, the while he was holding it behold, a bird swooped down on him and, snatching the same from his hand, flew off with it and then lighted on the ground. There-upon Kamar al-Zaman fearing to lose the jewel, ran after the bird; but it flew on before him, keeping just out of his reach, and ceased not to draw him on from dale to dale and from hill to hill, till the night starkened and the firmament darkened, when it roosted on a high tree. So Kamar al-Zaman stopped under the tree confounded in thought and faint for famine and fatigue, and giving himself up for lost, would have turned back, but knew not the way whereby he came, for that darkness had overtaken him. Then he exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious the Great!\"; and laying him down under the tree (whereon was the bird) slept till the morning, when he awoke and saw the bird also wake up and fly away. He arose and walked after it, and it flew on little by little before him, after the measure of his faring; at which he smiled and said, \"By Allah, a strange thing! Yesterday, this bird flew before me as fast as I could run, and to-day, knowing that I have awoke tired and cannot run, he flieth after the measure of my faring. By Allah, this is wonderful! But I must needs follow this bird whether it lead me to death or to life; and I will go wherever it goeth, for at all events it will not abide save in some inhabited land.[FN#309] So he continued to follow the bird which roosted every night upon a tree; and he ceased not pursuing it for a space of ten days, feeding on the fruits of the earth and drinking of its waters. At the end of this time, he came in sight of an inhabited city, whereupon the bird darted off like the glance of the eye and, entering the town, disappeared from Kamar al-Zaman, who knew not what it meant or whither it was gone; so he marvelled at this and exclaimed, \"Praise be to Allah who hath brought me in safety to this city!\" Then he sat down by a stream and washed his hands and feet and face and rested awhile; and, recalling his late easy and pleasant life of union with his beloved and contrasting it with his present plight of trouble and fatigue and distress and strangerhood and famine and severance, the tears streamed from his eyes and he began repeating these cinquains,\n\n\"Pain had I hid thy handwork, but it showed, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Changed sleep for wake, and wake with me abode:\nWhen thou didst spurn my heart I cried aloud *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Pate, hold thy hand and cease to gird and goad:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          In dole and danger aye my sprite I spy!\nAn but the Lord of Love were just to me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Sleep fro' my eyelids ne'er were forced to flee.\nPity, my lady, one for love o' thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Prom his tribes darling brought to low degree:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Love came and doomed Wealth beggar-death to die.\nThe railers chide at thee: I ne'er gainsay, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But stop my ears and dumbly sign them Nay:\n'Thou lov'st a slender may,' say they; I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'I've picked her out and cast the rest away:'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Enough; when Fate descends she blinds man's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          eye!\"[FN#310]\n\nAnd as soon as he had finished his poetry and had taken his rest, he rose and walked on little by little, till he entered the city.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that as soon as Kamar al-Zaman had finished his poetry and had taken his rest, he arose and entered the city-gate[FN#311] not knowing whither he should wend. He crossed the city from end to end, entering by the land-gate, and ceased not faring on till he came out at the sea- gate, for the city stood on the sea-shore. Yet he met not a single one of its citizens. And after issuing from the land-gate he fared forwards and ceased not faring till he found himself among the orchards and gardens of the place; and, passing among the trees presently came to a garden and stopped before its door; where-upon the keeper came out to him and saluted him. The Prince returned his greeting and the gardener bade him welcome, saying, \"Praised be Allah that thou hast come off safe from the dwellers of this city! Quick, come into the garth, ere any of the townfolk see thee.\" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman entered that garden, wondering in mind, and asked the keeper, \"What may be the history of the people of this city and who may they be?\" The other answered, \"Know that the people of this city are all Magians: but Allah upon thee, tell me how thou camest to this city and what caused thy coming to our capital.\" Accordingly Kamar al-Zaman told the gardener all that had befallen him from beginning to end, whereat he marvelled with great marvel and said, \"Know, O my son, that the cities of Al-Islam lie far from us; and between us and them is a four months' voyage by sea and a whole twelve months' journey by land. We have a ship which saileth every year with merchandise to the nearest Moslem country and which entereth the seas of the Ebony Islands and thence maketh the Khalidan Islands, the dominions of King Shahriman.\" Thereupon Kamar al- Zaman considered awhile and concluded that he could not do better than abide in the garden with the gardener and become his assistant, receiving for pay one fourth of the produce. So he said to him, \"Wilt thou take me into thy service, to help thee in this garden?\" Answered the gardener, \"To hear is to consent;\" and began teaching him to lead the water to the roots of the trees. So Kamar al-Zaman abode with him, watering the trees and hoeing up the weeds and wearing a short blue frock which reached to his knees. And he wept floods of tears; for he had no rest day or night, by reason of his strangerhood and he ceased not to repeat verses upon his beloved, amongst others the following couplets,\n\n\n\"Ye promised us and will ye not keep plight? *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ye said a say and shall not deed be dight?\nWe wake for passion while ye slumber and sleep; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Watchers and wakers claim not equal right:\nWe vowed to keep our loves in secrecy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But spake the meddler and you spoke forthright:\nO friend in pain and pleasure, joy and grief, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In all case you, you only, claim my sprite!\nMid folk is one who holds my prisoned heart; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would he but show some ruth for me to sight.\nNot every eye like mine is wounded sore, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Not every heart like mine love-pipings blight:\nYe wronged me saying, Love is wrongous aye *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yea! ye were right, events have proved that quite.\nForget they one love-thralled, whose faith the world *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Robs not, though burn the fires in heart alight:\nIf an my foeman shall become my judge, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whom shall I sue to remedy his despight?\nHad not I need of love nor love had sought, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My heart forsure were not thus love-distraught.\"\n\nSuch was the case with Kamar al-Zaman; but as regards his wife, the Lady Budur, when she awoke she sought her husband and found him not: then she saw her petticoat-trousers undone, for the band had been loosed and the bezel lost, whereupon she said to herself, \"By Allah, this is strange! Where is my husband? It would seem as if he had taken the talisman and gone away, knowing not the secret which is in it. Would to Heaven I knew whither can he have wended! But it must needs have been some extraordinary matter that drew him away, for he cannot brook to leave me a moment. Allah curse the stone and damn its hour!\" Then she considered awhile and said in her mind, \"If I go out and tell the varlets and let them learn that my husband is lost they will lust after me: there is no help for it but that I use stratagem. So she rose and donned some of her husband's clothes and riding- boots, and a turband like his, drawing one corner of it across her face for a mouth-veil.[FN#312] Then, setting a slave-girl in her litter, she went forth from the tent and called to the pages who brought her Kamar al-Zaman's steed; and she mounted and bade them load the beasts and resume the march. So they bound on the burdens and departed; and she concealed her trick, none doubting but she was Kamar al-Zaman, for she favoured him in face and form; nor did she cease journeying, she and her suite, days and nights, till they came in sight of a city overlooking the Salt Sea, where they pitched their tents without the walls and halted to rest. The Princess asked the name of the town and was told, \"It is called the City of Ebony; its King is named Arman\u00fas, and he hath a daughter Hay\u00e1t al-Nuf\u00fas[FN#313] hight,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Lady Budur halted within sight of the Ebony City to take her rest, King Armanus sent a messenger, to learn what King it was who had encamped without his capital; so the messenger, coming to the tents, made inquiry anent their King, and was told that she was a King's son who had lost the way being bound for the Khalidan Islands; whereupon he returned to King Armanus with the tidings; and, when the King heard them, he straightway rode out with the lords of his land to greet the stranger on arrival. As he drew near the tents the Lady Budur came to meet him on foot, whereupon the King alighted and they saluted each other. Then he took her to the city and, bringing her up to the palace, bade them spread the tables and trays of food and commanded them to transport her company and baggage to the guess house. So they abode there three days; at the end of which time the King came in to the Lady Budur. Now she had that day gone to the Hammam and her face shone as the moon at its full, a seduction to the world and a rending of the veil of shame to mankind; and Armanus found her clad in a -suit of silk, embroidered with gold and jewels; so he said to her, 'O my son, know that I am a very old man, decrepit withal, and Allah hath blessed me with no child save one daughter, who resembleth thee in beauty and grace; and I am now waxed unfit for the conduct of the state. She is shine, O my son; and, if this my land please thee and thou be willing to abide and make thy home here, I will marry thee to her and give thee my kingdom and so be at rest.\" When Princess Budur heard this, she bowed her head and her forehead sweated for shame, and she said to herself. \"How shall I do, and I a woman? If I refuse and depart from him, I cannot be safe but that haply send after me troops to slay me; and if I consent, belike I shall be put to shame. I have lost my beloved Kamar al-Zaman and know not what is become of him; nor can I escape from this scrape save by holding my peace and consenting and abiding here, till Allah bring about what is to be.\" So she raised her head and made submission to King Armanus, saying, \"Hearkening and obedience!\"; whereat he rejoiced and bade the herald make proclamation throughout the Ebony Islands to hold high festival and decorate the houses. Then he assembled his Chamberlains and Nabobs, and Emirs and Wazirs and his officers of state and the Kazis of the city; and, formally abdicating his Sultanate, endowed Budur therewith and invested her in all the vestments of royalty. The Emirs and Grandees went in to her and did her homage, nothing doubting but that she was a young man, and all who looked on her bepissed their bag-trousers, for the excess of her beauty and loveliness. Then, after the Lady Budur had been made Sultan and the drums had been beaten in announcement of the glad event, and she had been ceremoniously enthroned, King Armanus proceeded to equip his daughter Hayat al-Nufus for marriage, and in a few days, they brought the Lady Budur in to her, when they seemed as it were two moons risen at one time or two suns in conjunction. So they entered the bridal-chamber and the doors were shut and the curtains let down upon them, after the attendants had lighted the wax-candles and spread for them the carpet-bed. When Budur found herself alone with the Princess Hayat al-Nufus, she called to mind her beloved Kamar al-Zaman and grief was sore upon her. So she wept for his absence, and estrangement and she began repeating,\n\n\"O ye who fled and left my heart in pain low li'en, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     No breath of life if found within this frame of mine:\nI have an eye which e'er complains of wake, but lo! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tears occupy it would that wake content these eyne!\nAfter ye marched forth the lover 'bode behind; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Question of him what pains your absence could design!\nBut for the foods of tears mine eyelids rail and rain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My fires would flame on high and every land calcine.\nTo Allah make I moan of loved ones lost for aye, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who for my pine and pain no more shall pain and pine:\nI never wronged them save that over love I nurst: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Love departs us lovers into blest and curst.\"\n\nAnd when she had finished her repeating, the Lady Budur sat down beside the Princess Hayat al-Nufus and kissed her on the mouth; after which rising abruptly, she made the minor ablution and betook herself to her devotions; nor did she leave praying till Hayat al-Nufus fell asleep, when she slips into bed and lay with her back to her till morning. And when day had broke the King and Queen came in to their daughter and asked her how she did. whereupon she told them what she had seen, and repeated to them the verses she had heard. Thus far concerning Hayat al-Nufus and her father; but as regards Queen Budur she went forth and seated herself upon the royal throne and all the Emirs and Captains and Officers of state came up to her and wished her joy of the kingship, kissing the earth before her and calling down blessings upon her. And she accosted them with smiling face and clad them in robes of honour, augmenting the fiefs of the high officials and giving largesse to the levies; wherefore all the people loved her and offered up prayers for the long endurance of her reign, doubting not but that she was a man. And she ceased not sitting all day in the hall of audience, bidding and forbidding; dispensing justice, releasing prisoners and remitting the customs-dues, till nightfall, when she withdrew to the apartment prepared for her. Here she found Hayat al-Nufus seated, so she sat down by her side and, clapping her on the back, coaxed and caressed her and kissed her between the eyes, and fell to versifying in these couplets,\n\n\"What secret kept I these my tears have told, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And my waste body must my love unfold:\nThough hid my pine, my plight on parting day *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To every envious eye my secret sold:\nO ye who broke up camp, you've left behind *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My spirit wearied and my heart a-cold:\nIn my hearts core ye dwell, and now these eyne *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Roll blood-drops with the tears they whilome rolled:\nThe absent will I ransom with my soul; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     All can my yearning for their sight behold:\nI have an eye whose babe,[FN#314] for love of thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rejected sleep nor hath its tears controlled.\nThe foeman bids me patient bear his loss, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ne'er may mine ears accept the ruth he doled!\nI tricks their deme of me, and won my wish *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of Kamar al-Zaman's joys manifold:\nHe joins all perfect gifts like none before, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Boasted such might and main no King of old:\nSeeing his gifts, Bin Z\u00e1'idah's[FN#315] largesse *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Forget we, and Mu'\u00e1wiyah mildest-soul'd:[FN#316]\nWere verse not feeble and o'er short the time *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I had in laud of him used all of rhyme.\"\n\nThen Queen Budur stood up and wiped away her tears and, making the lesser ablution,[FN#317] applied her to pray: nor did she give over praying till drowsiness overcame the Lady Hayat al- Nufus and she slept, whereupon the Lady Budur came and lay by her till the morning. At daybreak, she arose and prayed the dawn- prayer; and presently seated herself on the royal throne and passed the day in ordering and counter ordering and giving laws and administering justice. This is how it fared with her; but as regards King Armanus he went in to his daughter and asked her how she did; so she told him all that had befallen her and repeated to him the verses which Queen Budur had recited, adding, \"O my father, never saw I one more abounding in sound sense and modesty than my husband, save that he cloth nothing but weep and sigh.\" He answered, \"O my daughter, have patience with him yet this third night, and if he go not in unto thee and do away thy maidenhead, we shall know how to proceed with him and oust him from the throne and banish him the country.\" And on this wise he agreed with his daughter what course he would take.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Tenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Armanus had agreed with his daughter on this wise and had determined what course he would take and night came on, Queen Budur arose from the throne of her kingdom and betaking herself to the palace, entered the apartment prepared for her. There she found the wax-candles lighted and the Princess Hayat al-Nufus seated and awaiting her; whereupon she bethought her of her husband and what had betided them both of sorrow and severance in so short a space; she wept and sighed and groaned groan upon groan, and began improvising these couplets,\n\n\"News of my love fill all the land, I swear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     As suns on Ghaz\u00e1[FN#318]-wold rain heat and glare:\nSpeaketh his geste but hard its sense to say; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thus never cease to grow my cark and care:\nI hate fair Patience since I loved thee; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     E'er sawest lover hate for love to bear?\nA glance that dealt love-sickness dealt me death, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Glances are deadliest things with torments rare:\nHe shook his love locks down and bared his chin, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whereby I spied his beauties dark and fair:\nMy care, my cure are in his hands; and he *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who caused their dolour can their dole repair:\nHis belt went daft for softness of his waist; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His hips, for envy, to uprise forbear:\nHis brow curl-diademed is murky night; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unveil 't and lo! bright Morn shows brightest light.\"\n\nWhen she had finished her versifying, she would have risen to pray, but, lo and behold! Hayat al-Nufus caught her by the skirt and clung to her saying, \"O my lord, art thou not ashamed before my father, after all his favour, to neglect me at such a time as this?\" When Queen Budur heard her words, she sat down in the same place and said, \"O my beloved, what is this thou sayest?\" She replied, \"What I say is that I never saw any so proud of himself as thou. Is every fair one so disdainful? I say not this to incline thee to me; I say it only of my fear for thee from King Armanus; because he purposeth, unless thou go in unto me this very night, and do away my maidenhead, to strip thee of the kingship on the morrow and banish thee his kingdom; and peradventure his excessive anger may lead him to slay thee. But I, O my lord, have ruth on thee and give thee fair warning; and it is thy right to reck.\"[FN#319] Now when Queen Budur heard her speak these words, she bowed her head ground-wards awhile in sore perplexity and said in herself, \"If I refuse I'm lost; and if I obey I'm shamed. But I am now Queen of all the Ebony Islands and they are under my rule, nor shall I ever again meet my Kamar al- Zaman save in this place; for there is no way for him to his native land but through the Ebony Islands. Verily, I know not what to do in my present case, but I commit my care to Allah who directeth all for the best, for I am no man that I should arise and open this virgin girl.\" Then quoth Queen Budur to Hayat al- Nufus, \"O my beloved, that I have neglected thee and abstained from thee is in my own despite.\" And she told her her whole story from beginning to end and showed her person to her, saying, \"I conjure thee by Allah to keep my counsel, for I have concealed my case only that Allah may reunite me with my beloved Kamar al- Zaman and then come what may.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eleventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Lady Budur acquainted Hayat al-Nufus with her history and bade her keep it secret, the Princess heard her with extreme wonderment and was moved to pity and prayed Allah to reunite her with her beloved, saying, \"Fear nothing, O my sister; but have patience till Allah bring to pass that which must come to pass:\" and she began repeating,\n\n\"None but the men of worth a secret keep;\nWith worthy men a secret's hidden deep;\nAs in a room, so secrets lie with me,\nWhose door is sealed, lock shot and lost the key.\"[FN#320]\n\nAnd when Hayat al-Nufus had ended her verses, she said, \"O my sister, verily the breasts of the noble and brave are of secrets the grave; and I will not discover shine.\" Then they toyed and embraced and kissed and slept till near the Mu'ezzin's call to dawn prayer, when Hayat al-Nufus arose and took a pigeon-poult,[FN#321] and cut its throat over her smock and besmeared herself with its blood. Then she pulled off her petticoat-trousers and cried aloud, where-upon her people hastened to her and raised the usual lullilooing and outcries of joy and gladness. Presently her mother came in to her and asked her how she did and busied herself about her and abode with her till evening; whilst the Lady Budur arose with the dawn, and repaired to the bath and, after washing herself pure, proceeded to the hall of audience, where she sat down on her throne and dispensed justice among the folk. Now when King Armanus heard the loud cries of joy, he asked what was the matter and was informed of the consummation of his daughter's marriage; whereat he rejoiced and his breast swelled with gladness and he made a great marriage-feast whereof the merry-making lasted a long time. Such was their case: but as regards King Shahriman it was on this wise. After his son had fared forth to the chase accompanied by Marzawan, as before related, he tarried patiently awaiting their return at nightfall; but when his son did not appear he passed a sleepless night and the dark hours were longsome upon him; his restlessness was excessive, his excitement grew upon him and he thought the morning would never dawn. Anc when day broke he sat expecting his son and waited till noon, but he came not; whereat his heart forebode separation and was fired with fears for Kamar al-Zaman; and he cried, \"Alas! my son!\" and he wept till his clothes were drenched with tears, and repeated with a beating heart,\n\n\n\"Love's votaries I ceased not to oppose, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Till doomed to taste Love's bitter and Love's sweet:\nI drained his rigour-cup to very dregs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Self humbled at its slaves' and freemen's feet:\nFortune had sworn to part the loves of us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     She kept her word how truly, well I weet!\"\n\nAnd when he ended his verse, he wiped away his tears and bade his troops make ready for a march and prepare for a long expedition. So they all mounted and set forth, headed by the Sultan, whose heart burnt with grief and was fired with anxiety for his son Kamar al-Zaman; and they advanced by forced marches. Now the King divided his host into six divisions, a right wing and a left wing, a vanguard and a rear guard;[FN#322] and bade them rendezvous for the morrow at the cross-roads. Accordingly they separated and scoured the country all the rest of that day till night, and they marched through the night and at noon of the ensuing day they joined company at the place where four roads met. But they knew not which the Prince followed, till they saw the sign of torn clothes and sighted shreds of flesh and beheld blood still sprinkled by the way and they noted every piece of the clothes and fragment of mangled flesh scattered on all sides. Now when King Shahriman saw this, he cried from his heart-core a loud cry, saying, \"Alas, my son!\"; and buffeted his face and plucks his beard and rent his raiment, doubting not but his son was dead. Then he gave himself up to excessive weeping and wailing, and the troops also wept for his weeping, all being assured that Prince Kamar al-Zaman had perished. They threw dust on their heads, and the night surprised them shedding tears and lamenting till they were like to die. Then the King with a heart on fire and with burning sighs spake these couplets,\n\n\"Chide not the mourner for bemourning woe; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Enough is yearning every Ill to show:\nHe weeps for stress of sorrow and of pain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And these to thee best evidence his lowe:\nHappy![FN#323] of whom Love sickness swore that ne'er *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Should cease his eye lids loving tears to flow:\nHe mourns the loss of fairest, fullest Moon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shining o'er all his peers in glorious glow:\nBut death made drink a brimming cup, what day *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     He fared from natal country fain to go:\nHis home left he and went from us to grief; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor to his brethren could he say adieu:\nYea, his loss wounded me with parting pangs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And separation cost me many a throe:\nHe fared farewelling, as he fared, our eyes; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Whenas his Lord vouch-safed him Paradise.\"\n\nAnd when King Shahriman had ended his verses, he returned with the troops to his capital,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twelfth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Shahriman had ended his verses, he returned with the troops to his capital, giving up his son for lost, and deeming that wild beasts or banditti had set upon him and torn him to pieces; and made proclamation that all in the Khalidan Islands should don black in mourning for him. Moreover, he built, in his memory, a pavilion, naming it House of Lamentations; and on Mondays and Thursdays he devoted himself to the business of the state and ordering the affairs of his levies and lieges; and the rest of the week he was wont to spend in the House of Lamentations, mourning for his son and bewailing him with elegiac verses,[FN#324] of which the following are some:\u2014\n\n\"My day of bliss is that when thou appearest; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My day of bale[FN#325] is that whereon thou farest:\nThough through the night I quake in dread of death; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Union wi' thee is of all bliss the dearest.\"\n\nAnd again he said,\n\n\"My soul be sacrifice for one, whose going *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Afflicted hearts with sufferings sore and dread:\nLet joy her widowed term[FN#326] fulfil, for I *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Divorced joy with the divorce thrice-said.\"[FN#327]\n\nSuch was the case with King Shahriman; but as regards Queen Budur daughter of King Ghayur, she abode as ruler in the Ebony Islands, whilst the folk would point to her with their fingers, and say, \"Yonder is the son-in-law of King Armanus.\" And every night she lay with Hayat al-Nufus, to whom she lamented her desolate state and longing for her husband Kamar al-Zaman; weeping and describing to her his beauty and loveliness, and yearning to enjoy him though but in a dream: And at times she would repeat,\n\n\"Well Allah wots that since my severance from thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I wept till forced to borrow tears at usury:\n'Patience!' my blamer cried, 'Heartsease right soon shalt see!' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Quoth I, 'Say, blamer, where may home of Patience be?'\"\n\nThis is how it fared with Queen Budur; but as regards Kamar al- Zaman, he abode with the gardener in the garden for no short time, weeping night and day and repeating verses bewailing the past time of enjoyment and delight; whilst the gardener kept comforting him and assuring him that the ship would set sail for the land of the Moslems at the end of the year. And in this condition he continued till one day he saw the folk crowding together and wondered at this; but the gardener came in to him and said, \"O my son, give over work for this day nor lead water to the trees; for it is a festival day, whereon folk visit one another. So take thy rest and only keep shine eye on the garden, whilst I go look after the ship for thee; for yet but a little while and I send thee to the land of the Moslems.\" Upon this, he went forth from the garden leaving to himself Kamar al-Zaman, who fell to musing upon his case till his heart was like to break and the tears streamed from his eyes. So he wept with excessive weeping till he swooned away and, when he recovered, he rose and walked about the garden, pondering what Time had done with him and bewailing the long endurance of his estrangement and separation from those he loved. As he was thus absorbed in melancholy thought, his foot stumbled and he fell on his face, his forehead striking against the projecting root of a tree; and the blow cut it open and his blood ran down and mingled with his tears Then he rose and, wiping away the blood, dried his tears and bound his brow with a piece of rag; then continued his walk about the garden engrossed by sad reverie. Presently, he looked up at a tree and saw two birds quarrelling thereon, and one of them rose up and smote the other with its beak on the neck and severed from its body its head, wherewith it flew away, whilst the slain bird fell to the ground before Kamar al-Zaman. As it lay, behold, two great birds swooped down upon it alighting, one at the head and the other at the tail, and both drooped their wings and bowed their bills over it and, extending their necks towards it, wept. Kamar al-Zaman also wept when seeing the birds thus bewail their mate, and called to mind his wife and father, And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman wept and lamented his separation from spouse and sire, when he beheld those two birds weeping over their mate. Then he looked at the twain and saw them dig a grave and therein bury the slain bird; after which they flew away far into the firmament and disappeared for a while; but presently they returned with the murtherer-bird and, alighting on the grave of the murthered, stamped on the slayer till they had done him to death. Then they rent his belly and tearing out his entrails, poured the blood on the grave of the slain[FN#328]: moreover, they stripped off his skin and tare his flesh in pieces and, pulling out the rest of the bowels, scattered them hither and thither. All this while Kamar al-Zaman was watching them wonderingly; but presently, chancing to look at the place where the two birds had slain the third, he saw therein something gleaming. So he drew near to it and noted that it was the crop of the dead bird. Whereupon he took it and opened it and found the talisman which had been the cause of his separation from his wife. But when he saw it and knew it, he fell to the ground a-fainting for joy; and, when he revived, he said, \"Praised be Allah! This is a foretaste of good and a presage of reunion with my beloved.\" Then he examined the jewel and passed it over his eyes[FN#329]; after which he bound it to his forearm, rejoicing in coming weal, and walked about till nightfall awaiting the gardener's return; and when he came not, he lay down and slept in his wonted place. At daybreak he rose to his work and, girding his middle with a cord of palm- fibre, took hatchet and basket and walked down the length of the garden, till he came to a carob-tree and struck the axe into its roots. The blow rang and resounded; so he cleared away the soil from the place and discovered a trap-door and raised it.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen It was the Two Hundred and Fourteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman raised the trap-door, he found a winding stair, which he descended and came to an ancient vault of the time of Ad and Tham\u00fad,[FN#330] hewn out of the rock. Round the vault stood many brazen vessels of the bigness of a great oil-jar which he found full of gleaming red gold: whereupon he said to himself, \"Verily sorrow is gone and solace is come!\" Then he mounted from the souterrain to the garden and, replacing the trap-door as it was before, busied himself in conducting water to the trees till the last of the day, when the gardener came back and said to him, \"O my son, rejoice at the good tidings of a speedy return to thy native land: the merchants are ready equipped for the voyage and the ship in three days' time will set sail for the City of Ebony, which is the first of the cities of the Moslems, and after making it, thou must travel by land a six months' march till thou come to the Islands of Khalidan, the dominions of King Shahriman.\" At this Kamar al-Zaman rejoiced and began repeating,\n\n\"Part not from one whose wont is not to part from you; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor with your cruel taunts an innocent mortify:\nAnother so long parted had ta'en heart from you, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And had his whole condition changed,\u2014but not so I.\"\n\nThen he kissed the gardener's hand and said, \"O my father, even as thou hast brought me glad tidings, so I also have great good news for thee,' and told him anent his discovery of the vault; whereat the gardener rejoiced and said, \"O my son, fourscore years have I dwelt in this garden and have never hit on aught whilst thou, who hast not sojourned with me a year, hast discovered this thing; wherefore it is Heaven's gift to thee, which shall end thy crosses and aid thee to rejoin thy folk and foregather with her thou lovest.\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"There is no help but it must be shared between me and thee.\" Then he carried him to the underground-chamber and showed him the gold, which was in twenty jars: he took ten and the gardener ten, and the old man said to him, \"O my son, fill thyself leather bottles[FN#331] with the sparrow-olives[FN#332] which grow in this garden, for they are not found except in our land; and the merchants carry them to all parts. Lay the gold in the bottles and strew it over with olives: then stop them and cover them and take them with thee in the ship.\" So Kamar al-Zaman arose without stay or delay and took fifty leather bottles and stored in each somewhat of the gold, and closed each one after placing a layer of olives over the gold; and at the bottom of one of the bottles he laid the talisman. Then sat he down to talk with the gardener, confident of speedy reunion with his own people and saying to himself, \"When I come to the Ebony Islands I will journey thence to my father's country and enquire for my beloved Budur. Would to Heaven I knew whether she returned to her own land or journeyed on to my father's country or whether there befel her any accident by the way.\" And he began versifying,\n\n\"Love in my breast they lit and fared away, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And far the land wherein my love is pent:\nFar lies the camp and those who camp therein; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Par is her tent-shrine, where I ne'er shall tent.\nPatience far deaf me when from me they fled; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Sleep failed mine eyes, endurance was forspent:\nThey left and with them left my every joy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Wending with them, nor find I peace that went:\nThey made these eyes roll down love tears in flood, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lacking them these eyne with tears are drent.\nWhen my taste spins once again would see them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When pine and expectation but augment,\nIn my heart's core their counterfeits I trace, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With love and yearning to behold their grace.\"\n\nThen, while he awaited the end of the term of days, he told the gardener the tale of the birds and what had passed between them; whereat the hearer wondered; and they both lay down and slept till the morning. The gardener awoke sick and abode thus two days; but on the third day, his sickness increased on him, till they despaired of his life and Kamar al-Zaman grieved with sore grief for him. Meanwhile behold, the Master and his crew came and enquired for the gardener; and, when Kamar al-Zaman told them that he was sick, they asked, \"Where be the youth who is minded to go with us to the Ebony Islands?\" \"He is your servent and he standeth before you!\" answered the Prince and bade them carry the bottles of olives to the ship; so they transported them, saying, \"Make haste, thou, for the wind is fair;\" and he replied, \"I hear and obey.\" Then he carried his provaunt on board and, returning to bid the gardener farewell, found him in the agonies of death; so he sat down at his head and closed his eyes, and his soul departed his body; whereupon he laid him out and committed him to the earth unto the mercy of Allah Almighty. Then he made for the ship but found that she had already weighed anchor and set sail; nor did she cease to cleave the seas till she disappeared from his sight. So he went back to whence he came heavy-hearted with whirling head; and neither would he address a soul nor return a reply; and reaching the garden and sitting down in cark and care he threw dust on his head and buffeted his cheeks.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fifteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the ship sped on her course, Kamar al-Zaman returned to the garden in cark and care; but- anon he rented the place of its owner and hired a man to help him in irrigating the trees. Moreover, he repaired the trap-door and he went to the underground chamber and bringing the rest of the gold to grass, stowed it in other fifty bottles which he filled up with a layer of olives. Then he enquired of the ship and they told him that it sailed but once a year, at which his trouble of mind redoubled and he cried sore for that which had betided him, above all for the loss of the Princess Budur's talisman, and spent his nights and days weeping and repealing verses. Such was his case; but as regards the ship she sailed with a favouring wind till she reached the Ebony Islands. Now by decree of destiny, Queen Budur was sitting at a lattice-window overlooking the sea and saw the galley cast anchor upon the strand. At this sight, her heart throbbed and she took horse with the Chamberlains and Nabobs and, riding down to the shore, halted by the ship, whilst the sailors broke bulk and bore the bales to the storehouses; after which she called the captain to her presence and asked what he had with him. He answered \"O King, I have with me in this ship aromatic drugs and cosmetics and healing powders and ointments and plasters and precious metals and rich stuffs and rugs of Yemen leather, not to be borne of mule or camel, and all manner of otters and spices and perfumes, civet and ambergris and camphor and Sumatra aloes-wood, and tamerinds[FN#333] and sparrow-olives to boot, such as are rare to find in this country.\" When she heard talk of sparrow- olives her heart longed for them and she said to the ship-master, \"How much of olives hast thou?\" He replied, \"Fifty bottles full, but their owner is not with us, so the King shall take what he will of them.\" Quoth she, \"Bring them ashore, that I may see them.'' Thereupon he called to the sailors, who brought her the fifty bottles; and she opened one and, looking at the olives, said to the captain, \"I will take the whole fifty and pay you their value, whatso it be.\" He answered, \"By Allah, O my lord, they have no value in our country; moreover their shipper tarried behind us, and he is a poor man.\" Asked she, \"And what are they worth here?\" and he answered \"A thousand dirhams.\" \"I will take them at a thousand,\" she said and bade them carry the fifty bottles to the palace. When it was night, she called for a bottle of olives and opened it, there being none in the room but herself and the Princess Hayat al-Nufus. Then, placing a dish before her she turned into it the contents of the jar, when there fell out into the dish with the olives a heap of red gold; and she said to the Lady Hayat al-Nufus, \"This is naught but gold!\" So she sent for the rest of the bottles and found them all full of precious metal and scarce enough olives to fill a single jar. Moreover, she sought among the gold and found therein the talisman, which she took and examined and behold, it was that which Kamar al- Zaman had taken from off the band of her petticoat trousers. Thereupon she cried out for joy and slipped down in a swoon;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Sixteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Budur saw the talisman she cried out for joy and slipped down in a swoon; and when she recovered she said to herself, \"Verily, this talisman was the cause of my separation from my beloved Kamar al-Zaman; but now it is an omen of good.\" Then she showed it to Hayat al-Nufus and said to her, \"This was the cause of disunion and now, please Allah, it shall be the cause of reunion.\" As soon as day dawned she seated herself on the royal throne and sent for the ship-master, who came into the presence and kissed the ground before her. Quoth she, \"Where didst thou leave the owner of these olives?\" Quoth he, \"O King of the age, we left him in the land of the Magians and he is a gardener there.\" She rejoined, \"Except thou bring him to me, thou knowest not the harm which awaiteth thee and thy ship.\" Then she bade them seal up the magazines of the merchants and said to them, \"Verily the owner of these olives hath borrowed of me and I have a claim upon him for debt and, unless ye bring him to me, I will without fail do you all die and seize your goods.\" So they went to the captain and promised him the hire of the ship, if he would go and return a second time, saying, \"Deliver us from this masterful tyrant.\" Accordingly the skipper embarked and set sail and Allah decreed him a prosperous voyage, till he came to the Island of the Magians and, landing by night, went up to the garden. Now the night was long upon Kamar al-Zaman, and he sat, bethinking him of his beloved, and bewailing what had befallen him and versifying,\n\n\"A night whose stars refused to run their course, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     A night of those which never seem outworn:\nLike Resurrection-day, of longsome length[FN#334] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To him that watched and waited for the morn.\"\n\nNow at this moment, the captain knocked at the garden-gate, and Kamar al-Zaman opened and went out to him, whereupon the crew seized him and went down with him on board the ship and set sail forthright; and they ceased not voyaging days and nights, whilst Kamar al-Zaman knew not why they dealt thus with him; but when he questioned them they replied, \"Thou hast offended against the Lord of the Ebony Islands, the son-in-law of King Armanus, and thou hast stolen his monies, miserable that thou art!\" Said he, \"By Allah! I never entered that country nor do I know where it is!\" However, they fared on with him, till they made the Ebony Islands and landing, carried him up to the Lady Budur, who knew him at sight and said, \"Leave him with the eunuchs, that they may take him to the bath.\" Then she relieved the merchants of the embargo and gave the captain a robe of honour worth ten thousand pieces of gold; and, after returning to the palace, she went in that night to the Princess Hayat al-Nufus and told her what had passed, saying, \"Keep thou my counsel, till I accomplish my purpose, and do a deed which shall be recorded and shall be read by Kings and commoners after we be dead and gone.\" And when she gave orders that they bear Kamar al-Zaman to the bath, they did so and clad him in a royal habit so that, when he came forth, he resembled a willow-bough or a star which shamed the greater and lesser light[FN#335] and its glow, and his life and soul returned to his frame. Then he repaired to the palace and went in to the Princess Budur; and when she saw him she schooled her heart to patience, till she should have accomplished her purpose; and she bestowed on him Mamelukes and eunuchs, camels and mules. Moreover, she gave him a treasury of money and she ceased not advancing him from dignity to dignity, till she made him Lord High Treasurer and committed to his charge all the treasures of the state; and she admitted him to familiar favour and acquainted the Emirs with his rank and dignity. And all loved him, for Queen Budur did not cease day by day to increase his allowances. As for Kamar al-Zaman, he was at a loss anent the reason of her thus honouring him; and he gave gifts and largesse out of the abundance of the wealth; and he devoted himself to the service of King Armanus; so that the King and all the Emirs and people, great and small, adored him and were wont to swear by his life. Nevertheless, he ever marvelled at the honour and favour shown him by Queen Budur and said to himself, \"By Allah, there needs must be a reason for this affection! Peradventure, this King favoureth me not with these immoderate favours save for some ill purpose and, therefore, there is no help but that I crave leave of him to depart his realm.\" So he went in to Queen Budur and said to her, \"O King, thou hast overwhelmed me with favours, but it will fulfil the measure of thy bounties if thou take from me all thou hast been pleased to bestow upon me, and permit me to depart.\" She smiled and asked, \"What maketh thee seek to depart and plunge into new perils, whenas thou art in the enjoyment of the highest favour and greatest prosperity?\" Answered Kamar al- Zaman, \"O King, verily this favour, if there be no reason for it, is indeed a wonder of wonders, more by token that thou hast advanced me to dignities such as befit men of age and experience, albeit I am as it were a young child.\" And Queen Budur rejoined, \"The reason is that I love thee for shine exceeding loveliness and thy surpassing beauty; and if thou wilt but grant me my desire of thy body, I will advance thee yet farther in honour and favour and largesse; and I will make thee Wazir, for all thy tender age even as the folk made me Sultan over them and I no older than thou; so that nowadays there is nothing strange when children take the head and by Allah, he was a gifted man who said,\n\n'It seems as though of Lot's tribe were our days, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And crave with love to advance the young in years.'\"[FN#336]\n\nWhen Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he was abashed and his cheeks flushed till they seemed a-flame; and he said, \"I need not these favours which lead to the commission of sin; I will live poor in wealth but wealthy in virtue and honour.\" Quoth she, \"I am not to be duped by thy scruples, arising from prudery and coquettish ways; and Allah bless him who saith,\n\n'To him I spake of coupling, but he said to me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    How long this noyous long persistency?'\nBut when gold piece I showed him, he cried, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   'Who from the Almighty Sovereign e'er shall flee?'\"\n\nNow when Kamar al-Zaman, heard these words and understood her verses and their import, he said, \"O King, I have not the habit of these doings, nor have I strength to bear these heavy burthens for which elder than I have proved unable; then how will it be with my tender age?\" But she smiled at his speech and retorted, \"Indeed, it is a matter right marvellous how error springeth from the disorder of man's intendiment!! Since thou art a boy, why standest thou in fear of sin or the doing of things forbidden, seeing that thou art not yet come to years of canonical responsibility; and the offences of a child incur neither punishment nor reproof? Verily, thou hast committed thyself to a quibble for the sake of contention, and it is thy duty to bow before a proposal of fruition, so henceforward cease from denial and coyness, for the commandment of Allah is a decree foreordained:[FN#337] indeed, I have more reason than thou to fear falling and by sin to be misled; and well inspired was he who said,\n\n'My prickle is big and the little one said, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Thrust boldly in vitals with lion-like stroke!\nThen I, ' 'Tis a sin!; and he, 'No sin to me! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   So I had him at once with a counterfeit poke.\"[FN#338]\n\nWhen Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, the light became darkness in his sight and he said, \"O King, thou hast in thy household fair women and female slaves, who have not their like in this age: shall not these suffice thee without me?

So he rose up with her, on this condition, and went with her to her own boudoir, that she might quench the lowe of her lust, saying, \"There is no Majesty, and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the fated decree of the All- powerful, the All-wise!\"; and he doffed his bag-trousers, shamefull and abashed, with the tears running from his eyes for stress of affright. Thereat she smiled and making him mount upon a couch with her, said to him, \"After this night, thou shalt see naught that will offend thee.\" Then she turned to him bussing and bosoming him and bending calf over calf, and said to him, \"Put thy hand between my thighs to the accustomed place; so haply it may stand up to prayer after prostration.\" He wept and cried, \"I am not good at aught of this,\" but she said, \"By my life, an thou do as I bid thee, it shall profit thee!\" So he put out his hand, with vitals a-fire for confusion, and found her thighs cooler than cream and softer than silk. The touching of them pleasured him and he moved his hand hither and thither, till it came to a dome abounding in good gifts and movements and shifts, and said in himself, \"Perhaps this King is a hermaphrodite,[FN#348] neither man nor woman quite;\" so he said to her, \"O King, I cannot find that thou hast a tool like the tools of men; what then moved thee to do this deed?\" Then loudly laughed Queen Budur till she fell on her back,[FN#349] and said, \"O my dearling, how quickly thou hast forgotten the nights we have lain together!\" Then she made herself known to him, and he knew her for his wife, the Lady Budur, daughter of King al-Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seas. So he embraced her and she embraced him, and he kissed her and she kissed him; then they lay down on the bed of pleasure voluptuous, repeating the words of the poet,\n\n\"When his softly bending shape bid him close to my embrace *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which clips him all about like the tendrils of the vine\nAnd shed a flood of softness on the hardness of his heart, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     He yielded though at first he was minded to decline;\nAnd dreading lest the railer's eye should light upon his form, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Came armoured with caution to baffle his design:\nHis waist makes moan of hinder cheeks that weigh upon his feet *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Like heavy load of merchandise upon young camel li'en;\nGirt with his glances scymitar which seemed athirst for blood, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And clad in mail of dusky curls that show the sheeniest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     shine,\nHis fragrance wafted happy news of footstep coming nigh, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to him like a bird uncaged I flew in straightest line:\nI spread my cheek upon his path, beneath his sandal-shoon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lo! the stibium[FN#350] of their dust healed all my hurt\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     of eyne.\nWith one embrace again I bound the banner of our loves[FN#351] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And loosed the knot of my delight that bound in bonds\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    malign:\nThen bade I make high festival, and straight came flocking in *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Pure joys that know not grizzled age[FN#352] nor aught of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     pain and pine:\nThe full moon dotted with the stars the lips and pearly teeth *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That dance right joyously upon the bubbling face of wine:\nSo in the prayer-niche of their joys I yielded me to what *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would make the humblest penitent of sinner most indign.\nI swear by all the signs[FN#353] of those glories in his face *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I'll ne'er forget the Chapter entituled Al-Ikhlas.\"[FN#354]\n\nThen Queen Budur told Kamar al-Zaman all that had befallen her from beginning to end and he did likewise; after which he began to upbraid her, saying, \"What moved thee to deal with me as thou hast done this night?\" She replied, \"Pardon me! for I did this by way of jest, and that pleasure and gladness might be increased.\" And when dawned the morn and day arose with its sheen and shone, she sent to King Armanus, sire of the Lady Hayat al-Nufus, and acquainted him with the truth of the case and that she was wife to Kamar al-Zaman. Moreover, she told him their tale and the cause of their separation, and how his daughter was a virgin, pure as when she was born. He marvelled at their story with exceeding marvel and bade them chronicle it in letters of gold. Then he turned to Kamar al-Zaman and said, \"O King's son, art thou minded to become my son-in-law by marrying my daughter?\" Replied he, \"I must consult the Queen Budur, as she hath a claim upon me for benefits without stint.\" And when he took counsel with her, she said, \"Right is thy recking; marry her and I will be her handmaid; for I am her debtor for kindness and favour and good offices, and obligations manifold, especially as we are here in her place and as the King her father hath whelmed us with benefits.\"[FN#355] Now when he saw that she inclined to this and was not jealous of Hayat al-Nufus, he agreed with her upon this matter.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Seventeenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman agreed with his wife, Queen Budur, upon this matter and told King Armanus what she had said; whereat he rejoiced with great joy. Then he went out and, seating himself upon his chair of estate, assembled all the Wazirs, Emirs, Chamberlains and Grandees, to whom he related the whole story of Kamar al-Zaman and his wife, Queen Budur, from first to last; and acquainted them with his desire to marry his daughter Hayat al-Nufus to the Prince and make him King in the stead of Queen Budur. Whereupon said they all, \"Since he is the husband of Queen Budur, who hath been our King till now, whilst we deemed her son-in-law to King Armanus, we are all content to have him to Sultan over us; and we will be his servants, nor will we swerve from his allegiance.\" So Armanus rejoiced hereat and, summoning Kazis and witnesses and the chief officers of state, bade draw up the contract of marriage between Kamar al-Zaman and his daughter, the Princess Hayat al-Nufus. Then he held high festival, giving sumptuous marriage-feasts and bestowing costly dresses of honour upon all the Emirs and Captains of the host; moreover he distributed alms to the poor and needy and set free all the prisoners. The whole world rejoiced in the coming of Kamar al-Zaman to the throne, blessing him and wishing him endurance of glory and prosperity, renown and felicity; and, as soon as he became King, he remitted the customs-dues and released all men who remained in gaol. Thus he abode a long while, ordering himself worthily towards his lieges; and he lived with his two wives in peace, happiness, constancy and content, lying the night with each of them in turn. He ceased not after this fashion during many years, for indeed all his troubles and afflictions were blotted out from him and he forgot his father King Shahriman and his former estate of honour and favour with him. After a while Almighty Allah blessed him with two boy children, as they were two shining moons, through his two wives; the elder whose name was Prince Amjad,[FN#356] by Queen Budur, and the younger whose name was Prince As'ad by Queen Hayat al-Nufus; and this one was comelier than his brother. They were reared in splendour and tender affection, in respectful bearing and in the perfection of training; and they were instructed in penmanship and science and the arts of government and horsemanship, till they attained the extreme accomplishments and the utmost limit of beauty and loveliness; both men and women being ravished by their charms. They grew up side by side till they reached the age of seventeen, eating and drinking together and sleeping in one bed, nor ever parting at any time or tide; wherefore all the people envied them. Now when they came to man's estate and were endowed with every perfection, their father was wont, as often as he went on a journey, to make them sit in his stead by turns in the hall of judgement; and each did justice among the folk one day at a time. But it came to pass, by confirmed fate and determined lot, that love for As'ad (son of Queen Hayat al-Nufus) rose in the heart of Queen Budur, and that affection for Amjad (son of Queen Budur) rose in the heart of Queen Hayat al-Nufus.[FN#357] Hence it was that each of the women used to sport and play with the son of her sister-wife, kissing him and straining him to her bosom, whilst each mother thought that the other's behaviour arose but from maternal affection. On this wise passion got the mastery of the two women's hearts and they became madly in love with the two youths, so that when the other's son came in to either of them, she would press him to her breast and long for him never to be parted from her; till, at last, when waiting grew longsome to them and they found no path to enjoyment, they refused meat and drink and banished the solace of sleep. Presently, the King fared forth to course and chase, bidding his two sons sit to do justice in his stead, each one day in turn as was their wont.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eighteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King fared forth to sport and hunt, bidding his two sons sit to do justice in his stead, each one day by turn, as was their wont. Now Prince Amjad sat in judgement the first day, bidding and forbidding, appointing and deposing, giving and refusing; and Queen Hayat al-Nufus, mother of As'ad, wrote to him a letter suing for his favour and discovering to him her passion and devotion; altogether put tiny off the mask and giving him to know that she desired to enjoy him. So she took a scroll and thereon indited these cadences, \"From the love deranged * the sorrowful and estranged * whose torment is prolonged for the longing of thee! * Were I to recount to thee the extent of my care * and what of sadness I bear * the passion which my heart cloth tear * and all that I endure for weeping and unrest * and the rending of my sorrowful breast * my unremitting grief * and my woe without relief * and all my suffering for severance of thee * and sadness and love's ardency * no letter could contain it; nor calculation could compass it * Indeed earth and heaven upon me are strait; and I have no hope and no trust but what from thee I await * Upon death I am come nigh * and the horrors of dissolution I aby * Burning upon me is sore * with parting pangs and estrangement galore * Were I to set forth the yearnings that possess me more and more * no scrolls would suffice to hold such store * and of the excess of my pain and pine, I have made the following lines:- -\n\nWere I to dwell on heart-consuming heat, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unease and transports in my spins meet,\nNothing were left of ink and reeden pen *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor aught of paper; no, not e'en a sheet.\n\nThen Queen Hayat al-Nufus wrapped up her letter in a niece of costly silk scented with musk and ambergris; and folded it up with her silken hair-strings[FN#358] whose cost swallowed down treasures laid it in a handkerchief and gave it to a eunuch bidding him bear it to Prince Amjad.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Nineteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that she gave her missive to the eunuch in waiting and bade him bear it to Prince Amjad. And that eunuch went forth ignoring what the future hid for him (for the Omniscient ordereth events even as He willeth); and, going in to the Prince, kissed the ground between his hands and handed to him the letter. On receiving the kerchief he opened it and, reading the epistle and recognizing its gist he was ware that his father's wife was essentially an adulteress and a traitress at heart to her husband, King Kamar al-Zaman. So he waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and railed at women and their works, saying, \"Allah curse women, the traitresses, the imperfect in reason and religion!\"[FN#359] Then he drew his sword and said to the eunuch, \"Out on thee, thou wicked slave! Dost thou carry messages of disloyalty for thy lord's wife? By Allah, there is no good in thee, O black of hue and heart, O foul of face and Nature's forming!\" So he smote him on the neck and severed his head from his body; then, folding the kerchief over its contents he thrust it into his breast pocket and went in to his own mother and told her what had passed, reviling and reproaching her, and saying, \"Each one of you is viler than the other; and, by Allah the Great and Glorious, did I not fear ill-manneredly to transgress against the rights of my father, Kamar al-Zaman, and my brother, Prince As'ad, I would assuredly go in to her and cut off her head, even as I cut off that of her eunuch!\" Then he went forth from his mother in a mighty rage; and when the news reached Queen Hayat al-Nufus of what he had done with her eunuch, she abused him[FN#360] and cursed him and plotted perfidy against him. He passed the night, sick with rage, wrath and concern; nor found he pleasure in meat, drink or sleep. And when the next morning dawned Prince As'ad fared forth in his turn to rule the folk in his father's stead, whilst his mother, Hayat al-Nufus, awoke in feeble plight because of what she had heard from Prince Amjad concerning the slaughter of her eunuch. So Prince As'ad sat in the audience-chamber that day, judging and administering justice, appointing and deposing, bidding and forbidding, giving and bestowing. And he ceased not thus till near the time of afternoon-prayer, when Queen Budur sent for a crafty old woman and, discovering to her what was in her heart, wrote a letter to Prince As'ad, complaining of the excess of her affection and desire for him in these cadenced lines, \"From her who perisheth for passion and love-forlorn * to him who in nature and culture is goodliest born * to him who is conceited of his own loveliness * and glories in his amorous grace * who from those that seek to enjoy him averteth his face * and refuseth to show favour unto the self abasing and base * him who is cruel and of disdainful mood * from the lover despairing of good * to Prince As'ad * with passing beauty endowed * and of excelling grace proud * of the face moon bright * and the brow flower-white * and dazzling splendid light * This is my letter to him whose love melteth my body * and rendeth my skin and bones! * Know that my patience faileth me quite * and I am perplexed in my plight * longing and restlessness weary me * and sleep and patience deny themselves to me * but mourning and watching stick fast to me * and desire and passion torment me * and the extremes of languor and sickness have sheet me * Yet may my life be a ransom for thee * albeit thy pleasure be to slay her who loveth thee * and Allah prolong the life of thee * and preserve thee from all infirmity!\" And after these cadences she wrote these couplets,\n\n\"Fate hath commanded I become thy fere, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O shining like full moon when clearest clear!\nAll beauty dost embrace, all eloquence; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Brighter than aught within our worldly sphere:\nContent am I my torturer thou be: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply shalt alms me with one lovely leer!\nHappy her death who dieth for thy love! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     No good in her who holdeth thee unclear!\"\n\nAnd also the following couplets,\n\n\"Unto thee, As'ad! I of passion-pangs complain; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Have ruth on slave of love so burnt with flaming pain:\nHow long, I ask, shall hands of Love disport with me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With longings, dolour, sleepliness and bale and bane?\nAnon I 'plain of sea in heart, anon of fire *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In vitals, O strange case, dear wish, my fairest fain!\nO blamer, cease thy blame, and seek thyself to fly *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From love, which makes these eyne a rill of tears to rain.\nHow oft I cry for absence and desire, Ah grief! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But all my crying naught of gain for me shall gain:\nThy rigours dealt me sickness passing power to bear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thou art my only leach, assain me an thou deign!\nO chider, chide me not in caution, for I doubt *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That plaguey Love to thee shall also deal a bout.\"\n\nThen Queen Budur perfumed the letter-paper with a profusion of odoriferous musk and, winding it in her hairstrings which were of Iraki silk, with pendants of oblong emeralds, set with pearls and stones of price, delivered it to the old woman, bidding her carry it to Prince As'ad.[FN#361] She did so in order to pleasure her, and going in to the Prince, straightway and without stay, found him in his own rooms and delivered to him the letter in privacy; after which she stood waiting an hour or so for the answer. When As'ad had read the paper and knew its purport, he wrapped it up again in the ribbons and put it in his bosom-pocket: then (for he was wrath beyond all measure of wrath) he cursed false women and sprang up and drawing his sword, smote the old trot on the neck and cut off her pate. Thereupon he went in to his mother, Queen Hayat al-Nufus, whom he found lying on her bed in feeble case, for that which had betided her with Prince Amjad, and railed at her and cursed her; after which he left her and fore-gathered with his brother, to whom he related all that had befallen him with Queen Budur, adding, \"By Allah, O my brother, but that I was ashamed before thee, I had gone in to her forthright and had smitten her head off her shoulders!\" Replied Prince Amjad, \"By Allah, O my brother, yesterday when I was sitting upon the seat of judgement, the like of what hath befallen thee this day befel me also with thy mother who sent me a letter of similar purport.\" And he told him all that had passed, adding, \"By Allah, O my brother, naught but respect for thee withheld me from going in to her and dealing with her even as I dealt with the eunuch!\" They passed the rest of the night conversing and cursing womankind, and agreed to keep the matter secret, lest their father should hear of it and kill the two women. Yet they ceased not to suffer trouble and foresee affliction. And when the morrow dawned, the King returned with his suite from hunting and sat awhile in his chair of estate; after which he sent the Emirs about their business and went up to his palace, where he found his two wives lying a-bed and both exceeding sick and weak. Now they had made a plot against their two sons and concerted to do away their lives, for that they had exposed themselves before them and feared to be at their mercy and dependent upon their forbearance. When Kamar al-Zaman saw them on this wise, he said to them, \"What aileth you?\" Whereupon they rose to him and kissing his hands answered, perverting the case and saying \"Know, O King, that thy two sons, who have been reared in thy bounty, have played thee false and have dishonoured thee in the persons of thy wives.\" Now when he heard this, the light became darkness in his sight, and he raged with such wrath that his reason fled: then said he to them, \"Explain me this matter.\" Replied Queen Budur, \"O King of the age, know that these many days past thy son As'ad hath been in the persistent habit of sending me letters and messages to solicit me to lewdness and adultery while I still forbade him from this, but he would not be forbidden; and, when thou wentest forth to hunt, he rushed in on me, drunk and with a drawn sword in his hand, and smiting my eunuch, slew him. Then he mounted on my breast, still holding the sword, and I feared lest he should slay me, if I gainsaid him, even as he had slain my eunuch; so he took his wicked will of me by force. And now if thou do me not justice on him, O King, I will slay myself with my own hand, for I have no need of life in the world after this foul deed.\" And Queen Hayat al-Nufus, choking with tears, told him respecting Prince Amjad a story like that of her sister-wife.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twentieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Queen Hayat al-Nufus told her husband, King Kamar al-Zaman, a story like that of her sister in wedlock, Budur, and, quoth she, \"The same thing befel me with thy son Amjad;\" after which she took to weeping and wailing and said, \"Except thou do me justice on him I will tell my father, King Armanus.\" Then both women wept with sore weeping before King Kamar al-Zaman who, when he saw their tears and heard their words, concluded that their story was true and, waxing wroth beyond measure of wrath, went forth thinking to fall upon his two sons and put them to death. On his way he met his father- in-law, King Armanus who, hearing of his return from the chase, had come to salute him at that very hour and, seeing him with naked brand in hand and blood dripping from his nostrils, for excess of rage, asked what ailed him. So Kamar al-Zaman told him all that his sons Amjad and As'ad had done and added, \"And here I am now going in to them to slay them in the foulest way and make of them the most shameful of examples.\" Quoth King Armanus (and indeed he too was wroth with them), \"Thou dost well, O my son, and may Allah not bless them nor any sons that do such deed against their father's honour. But, O my son, the sayer of the old saw saith, 'Whoso looketh not to the end hath not Fortune to friend.' In any case, they are thy sons, and it befitteth not that thou kill them with shine own hand, lest thou drink of their death-agony,[FN#362] and anon repent of having slain them whenas repentance availeth thee naught. Rather do thou send them with one of thy Mamelukes into the desert and let him kill them there out of thy sight, for, as saith the adage, 'Out of sight of my friend is better and pleasanter.'[FN#363] And when Kamar al-Zaman heard his father-in-law's words, he knew them to be just; so he sheathed his sword and turning back, sat down upon the throne of his realm. There he summoned his treasurer, a very old man, versed in affairs and in fortune's vicissitudes, to whom he said, \"Go in to my sons, Amjad and As'ad; bind their hands behind them with strong bonds, lay them in two chests and load them upon a mule. Then take horse thou and carry them into mid desert, where do thou kill them both and fill two vials with their blood and bring the same to me in haste.\" Replied the treasurer, \"I hear and I obey,\" and he rose up hurriedly and went out forthright to seek the Princes; and, on his road, he met them coming out of the palace-vestibule, for they had donned their best clothes and their richest; and they were on their way to salute their sire and give him joy of his safe return from his going forth to hunt. Now when he saw them, he laid hands on them, saying, \"Omy sons, know ye that I am but a slave commanded, and that your father hath laid a commandment on me; will ye obey his commandment?\" They said, \"Yes\"; whereupon he went up to them and, after pinioning their arms, laid them in the chests which he loaded on the back of a mule he had taken from the city. And he ceased not carrying them into the open country till near noon, when he halted in a waste and desolate place and, dismounting from his mare, let down the two chests from the mule's back. Then he opened them and took out Amjad and As'ad; and when he looked upon them he wept sore for their beauty and loveliness; then drawing his sword he said to them, \"By Allah, O my lords, indeed it is hard for me to deal so evilly by you; but I am to be excused in this matter, being but a slave commanded, for that your father King Kamar al-Zaman hath bidden me strike off your heads.\" They replied, \"O Emir, do the King's bidding, for we bear with patience that which Allah (to Whom be Honour, Might and Glory!) hath decreed to us; and thou art quit of our blood.\" Then they embraced and bade each other farewell, and As'ad said to the treasurer, \"Allah upon thee, O uncle, spare me the sight of my brother's death-agony and make me not drink of his anguish, but kill me first, for that were the easier for me.\" And Amjad said the like and entreated the treasurer to kill him before As'ad, saying, \"My brother is younger than I; so make me not taste of his anguish. And they both wept bitter tears whilst the treasurer wept for their weeping;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the treasurer wept for their weeping; then the two brothers embraced and bade farewell and one said to the other, \"All this cometh of the malice of those traitresses, my mother and thy mother; and this is the reward of my forbearance towards thy mother and of thy for bearance towards my mother! But there is no Might and there is no Majesty save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily, we are Allah's and unto Him we are returning.\"[FN#364] And As'ad em braced his brother, sobbing and repeating these couplets,\n\n\"O Thou to whom sad trembling wights in fear complain! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   O ever ready whatso cometh to sustain!\nThe sole resource for me is at Thy door to knock, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   At whose door knock an Thou to open wilt not deign?\nO Thou whose grace is treasured in the one word, Be![FN#365] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Favour me, I beseech, in Thee all weals contain.\"\n\nNow when Amjad heard his brother's weeping he wept also and pressing him to his bosom repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"O Thou whose boons to me are more than one! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose gifts and favours have nor count nor bound!\nNo stroke of all Fate's strokes e'er fell on me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Thee to take me by the hand I found.\"\nThen said Amjad to the treasurer, \"I conjure thee by the One, Omnipotent, the Lord of Mercy, the Beneficent! slay me before my brother As'ad, so haply shall the fire be quencht in my heart's core and in this life burn no more.\" But As'ad wept and exclaimed, \"Not so: I will die first;\" whereupon quoth Amjad, \"It were best that I embrace thee and thou embrace me, so the sword may fall upon us and slay us both at a single stroke.\" Thereupon they embraced, face to face and clung to each other straitly, whilst the treasurer tied up the twain and bound them fast with cords, weeping the while. Then he drew his blade and said to them, \"By Allah, O my lords, it is indeed hard to me to slay you! But have ye no last wishes that I may fulfil or charges which I may carry out, or message which I may deliver?\" Replied Amjad, \"We have no wish; and my only charge to thee is that thou set my brother below and me above him, that the blow may fall on me first, and when thou hast killed us and returnest to the King and he asketh thee, 'What heardest thou from them before their death?'; do thou answer, 'Verily thy sons salute thee and say to thee, Thou knewest not if we were innocent or guilty, yet hast thou put us to death and hast not certified thyself of our sin nor looked into our case.' Then do thou repeat to him these two couplets,\n\n'Women are Satans made for woe o' men; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I fly to Allah from their devilish scathe:\nSource of whatever bale befel our kind, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    In wordly matters and in things of Faith.'\"\n\nContinued Amjad, \"We desire of thee naught but that thou repeat to our sire these two couplets.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was ad the Two Hundred and Twenty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Amjad added, speaking to the treasurer, \"We desire of thee naught but that thou repeat to our sire these two couplets which thou hast just now heard; and I conjure thee by Allah to have patience with us, whilst I cite to my brother this other pair of couplets.\" Then he wept with sore weeping and began,\n\n\"The Kings who fared before us showed *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Of instances full many a show:\nOf great and small and high and low *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     How many this one road have trod!\"\n\nNow when the treasurer heard these words from Amjad, he wept till his beard was wet, whilst As'ad's eyes brimmed with tears and he in turn repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Fate frights us when the thing is past and gone; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Weeping is not for form or face alone[FN#366]:\nWhat ails the Nights?[FN#367] Allah blot out our sin, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And be the Nights by other hand undone!\nEre this Zubayr-son[FN#368] felt their spiteful hate, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who fled for refuge to the House and Stone:\nWould that when Kh\u00e1rijah was for Amru slain[FN#369] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     They had ransomed Ali with all men they own.\"\n\nThen, with cheeks stained by tears down railing he recited also these verses,\n\n\"In sooth the Nights and Days are charactered *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    By traitor falsehood and as knaves they lie;\nThe Desert-reek[FN#370] recalls their teeth that shine; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    All horrid blackness is their K of eye:\nMy sin anent the world which I abhor *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Is sin of sword when sworders fighting hie.\"\n\nThen his sobs waxed louder and he said,\n\n\"O thou who woo'st a World[FN#371] unworthy, learn *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    'Tis house of evils, 'tis Perdition's net:\nA house where whoso laughs this day shall weep *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    The next: then perish house of fume and fret!\nEndless its frays and forays, and its thralls *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Are ne'er redeemed, while endless risks beset.\nHow many gloried in its pomps and pride, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Till proud and pompous did all bounds forget,\nThen showing back of shield she made them swill[FN#372] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Full draught, and claimed all her vengeance debt.\nFor know her strokes fall swift and sure, altho' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Long bide she and forslow the course of Fate:\nSo look thou to thy days lest life go by *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Idly, and meet thou more than thou hast met;\nAnd cut all chains of world-love and desire *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And save thy soul and rise to secrets higher.\"\n\nNow when As'ad made an end of these verses, he strained his brother Amjad in his arms, till they twain were one body, and the treasurer, drawing his sword, was about to strike them, when behold, his steed took fright at the wind of his upraised hand, and breaking its tether, fled into the desert. Now the horse had cost a thousand gold pieces and on its back was a splendid saddle worth much money; so the treasurer threw down his sword, and ran after his beast.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when his horse ran away, the treasurer ran after it in huge concern, and ceased not running to catch the runaway till it entered a thicket. He followed it whilst it dashed through the wood, smiting the earth with its hoofs till it raised a dust-cloud which towered high in air; and snorting and puffing and neighing and waxing fierce and furious. Now there happened to be in this thicket a lion of terrible might; hideous to sight, with eyes sparkling light: his look was grim and his aspect struck fright into man's sprite. Presentry the treasurer turned and saw the lion making towards him; but found no way of escape nor had he his sword with him. So he said in himself, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This strait is come upon me for no other cause but because of Amjad and As'ad; and indeed this journey was unblest from the first!\" Meanwhile the two Princes were grievously oppressed by the heat and grew sore athirst, so that their tongues hung out and they cried for succour, but none came to their relief and they said, \"Would to Heaven we had been slain and were at peace from this pain! But we know not whither the horse hath fled, that the treasurer is gone and hath left us thus pinioned. If he would but come back and do us die, it were easier to us than this torture to aby.\" Said As'ad, \"O my brother, be patient, and the relief of Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) shall assuredly come to us; for the horse started not away save of His favour towards us, and naught irketh us but this thirst.\" Upon this he stretched and shook himself and strained right and left, till he burst his pinion-bonds; then he rose and unbound his brother and catching up the Emir's sword, said, \"By Allah, we will not go hence, till we look after him and learn what is become of him.\" Then they took to following on the trail till it led them to the thicket and they said to each other, \"Of a surety, the horse and the treasurer have not passed out of this wood.\" Quoth As'ad, \"Stay thou here, whilst I enter the thicket and search it;\" and Amjad replied, \"I will not let thee go in alone: nor will we enter it but together; so if we escape, we shall escape together and if we perish, we shall perish together.\" Accordingly both entered and found that the lion had sprang upon the treasurer, who lay like a sparrow in his grip, calling upon Allah for aid and signing with his hands to Heaven. Now when Amjad saw this, he took the sword and, rushing upon the lion, smote him between the eyes and laid him dead on the ground. The Emir sprang up, marvelling at this escape and seeing Amjad and As'ad, his master's sons, standing there, cast himself at their feet and exclaimed, \"By Allah, O my lords, it were intolerable wrong in me to do you to death. May the man never be who would kill you! Indeed, with my very life, I will ransom you.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the treasurer to Amjad and As'ad, \"With my life will I ransom you both!\" Then he hastily rose and, at once embracing them, enquired how they had loosed their bonds and come thither; whereupon they told him how the bonds of one of them had fallen loose and he had unbound the other, whereto they were helped by the purity of their intentions, and how they had tracked his trail till they came upon him. So he thanked them for their deed and went with them forth of the thicket; and, when they were in the open country, they said to him, \"O uncle, do our father's bidding.\" He replied, \"Allah forbid that I should draw near to you with hurt! But know ye that I mean to take your clothes and clothe you with mine; then will I fill two vials with the lion's blood and go back to the King and tell him I have out vou to death. But as for you two, fare ye forth into the lands, for Allah's earth is wide; and know, O my lords, that it paineth me to part from you.\" At this, they all fell a-weeping; then the two youths put off their clothes and the treasurer habited them with his own. Moreover he made two parcels of their dress and, filling two vials with the lion's blood, set the parcels before him on his horse's back. Presently he took leave of them and, making his way to the city, ceased not faring till he went in to King Kamar al-Zaman and kissed the ground between his hands. The King saw him changed in face and troubled (which arose from his adventure with the lion) and, deeming this came of the slaughter of his two sons, rejoiced and said to him, \"Hast thou done the work?\" \"Yes, O our lord,\" replied the treasurer and gave him the two parcels of clothes and the two vials full of blood. Asked the King, \"What didst thou observe in them; and did they give thee any charge?\" Answered the treasurer, \"I found them patient and resigned to what came down upon them and they said to me, 'Verily, our father is excusable; bear him our salutation and say to him, 'Thou art quit of our killing. But we charge thee repeat to him these couplets,\n\n'Verily women are devils created for us. We seek refuge with God from the artifice of the devils. They are the source of all the misfortunes that have appeared among mankind in the affairs of the world and of religion.'''[FN#373]\n\nWhen the King heard these words of the treasurer, he bowed his head earthwards, a long while and knew his sons' words to mean that they had been wrongfully put to death. Then he bethought himself of the perfidy of women and the calamities brought about by them; and he took the two parcels and opened them and fell to turning over his sons' clothes and weeping,\u2014And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Kamar la-Zaman opened the two bundles and fell to turning over his sons' clothes and weeping, it so came to pass that he found, in the pocket of his son As'ad's raiment, a letter in the hand of his wife enclosing her hair strings; so he opened and read it and understanding the contents knew that the Prince had been falsely accused and wrongously. Then he searched Amjad's parcel of dress and found in his pocket a letter in the handwriting of Queen Hayat al-Nufus enclosing also her hair-strings; so he opened and read it and knew that Amjad too had been wronged; whereupon he beat hand upon hand and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I have slain my sons unjustly.\" And he buffeted his face, crying out, \"Alas, my sons! Alas, my long grief!\" Then he bade them build two tombs in one house, which he styled \"House of Lamentations,\" and had graved thereon his sons' names; and he threw himself on Amjad's tomb, weeping and groaning and lamenting, and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"O moon for ever set this earth below, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose loss bewail the stars which stud the sky!\nO wand, which broken, ne'er with bend and wave *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Shall fascinate the ravisht gazer's eye;\nThese eyne for jealousy I 'reft of thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Nor shall they till next life thy sight descry:\nI'm drowned in sea of tears for insomny *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Wherefore, indeed in S\u00e1hirah-stead[FN#374] I lie.\"\nThen he threw himself on As'ad's tomb, groaning and weeping and lamenting and versifying with these couplets,\n\"Indeed I longed to share unweal with thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    But Allah than my will willed otherwise:\nMy grief all blackens 'twixt mine eyes and space, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yet whitens all the blackness from mine eyes:[FN#375]\nOf tears they weep these eyne run never dry, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And ulcerous flow in vitals never dries:\nRight sore it irks me seeing thee in stead[FN#376] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Where slave with sovran for once levelled lies.\"\n\nAnd his weeping and wailing redoubled; and, after he had ended his lamentations and his verse, he forsook his friends and intimates, and denying himself to his women and his family, cut himself off from the world in the House of Lamentations, where he passed his time in weeping for his sons. Such was his case; but as regards Amjad and As'ad they fared on into the desert eating of the fruits of the earth and drinking of the remnants of the rain for a full month, till their travel brought them to a mountain of black flint[FN#377] whose further end was unknown; and here the road forked, one line lying along the midway height and the other leading to its head. They took the way trending to the top and gave not over following it five days, but saw no end to it and were overcome with weariness, being unused to walking upon the mountains or elsewhere.[FN#378] At last, despairing of coming to the last of the road, they retraced their steps and, taking the other, that led over the midway heights,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princes Amjad and As'ad returned from the path leading to the Mountain- head and took that which ran along the midway heights, and walked through all that day till nightfall, when As'ad, weary with much travel, said to Amjad, \"O my brother, I can walk no farther, for I am exceeding weak.\" Replied Amjad, \"O my brother, take courage! May be Allah will send us relief.\" So they walked on part of the night, till the darkness closed in upon them, when As'ad became weary beyond measure of weariness and cried out, \"O my brother, I am worn out and spent with walking,\" and threw himself upon the ground and wept. Amjad took him in his arms and walked on with him, bytimes sitting down to rest till break of day, when they came to the mountain-top and found there a stream of running water and by it a pomegranate-tree and a prayer-niche.[FN#379] They could hardly believe their eyes when they saw it; but, sitting down by that spring, drank of its water and ate of the fruit of that granado-tree; after which they lay on the ground and slept till sunrise, when they washed and bathed in the spring and, eating of the pomegranates, slept again till the time of mid-afternoon prayer. Then they thought to continue their journey, but As'ad could not walk, for both his feet were swollen. So they abode there three days till they were rested, after which they set out again and fared on over the mountain days and nights, tortured by and like to die of thirst, till they sighted a city gleaming afar off, at which they rejoiced and made towards it. When they drew near it, they thanked Allah (be His Name exalted!) and Amjad said to As'ad, \"O my brother, sit here, whilst I go to yonder city and see what it is and whose it is and where we are in Allah's wide world, that we may know through what lands we have passed in crossing this mountain, whose skirts had we followed, we had not reached this city in a whole year. So praised be Allah for safety!\" Replied As'ad, \"By Allah, O my brother, none shall go down into that city save myself, and may I be thy ransom! If thou leave me alone, be it only for an hour, I shall imagine a thousand things and be drowned in a torrent of anxiety on shine account, for I cannot brook shine absence from me.\" Amjad rejoined, \"Go then and tarry not. So As'ad took some gold pieces, and leaving his brother to await him, descended the mountain and ceased not faring on till he entered the city. As he threaded the streets he was met by an old man age-decrepit, whose beard flowed down upon his breast and forked in twain;[FN#380] he bore a walking-staff in his hand and was richly clad, with a great red turband on his head. When As'ad saw him, he wondered at his dress and his mien; nevertheless, he went up to him and saluting him said, \"Where be the way to the market, O my master?\" Hearing these words the Shaykh smiled in his face and replied, \"O my son, meseemeth thou art a stranger?\" As'ad rejoined, \"Yes, I am a stranger.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Shaykh who met As'ad smiled in his face and said to him, \"O my son, meseemeth thou art a stranger?\" and As'ad replied, \"Yes, I am a stranger.\" Then rejoined the old man, \"Verily, thou gladdenest our country with thy presence, O my son, and thou desolatest shine own land by reason of shine absence. What wantest thou of the market?\" Quoth As'ad, \"O uncle, I have a brother, with whom I have come from a far land and with whom I have journeyed these three months; and, when we sighted this city, I left him, who is my elder brother, upon the mountain and came hither, purposing to buy victual and what else, and return therewith to him, that we might feed thereon.\" Said the old man, \"Rejoice in all good, O my son, and know thou that to-day I give a marriage-feast, to which I have bidden many guests, and I have made ready plenty of meats, the best and most delicious that heart can desire. So if thou wilt come with me to my place, I will give thee freely all thou lackest without asking thee a price or aught else. Moreover I will teach thee the ways of this city; and, praised be Allah, O my son, that I, and none other have happened upon thee.\" \"As thou wilt,\" answered As'ad, \"do as thou art disposed, but make haste, for indeed my brother awaiteth me and his whole heart is with me.\" The old man took As'ad by the hand and carried him to a narrow lane, smiling in his face and saying, \"Glory be to Him who hath delivered thee from the people of this city!\" And he ceased not walking till he entered a spacious house, wherein was a saloon and behold, in the middle of it were forty old men, well stricken in years, collected together and forming a single ring as they sat round about a lighted fire, to which they were doing worship and prostrating themselves.[FN#381] When As'ad saw this, he was confounded and the hair of his body stood on end though he knew not what they were; and the Shaykh said to them, \"O Elders of the Fire, how blessed is this day!\" Then he called aloud, saying, \"Hello, Ghazb\u00e1n!\" Whereupon there came out to him a tall black slave of frightful aspect, grim-visaged and flat nosed as an ape who, when the old man made a sign to him, bent As'ad's arms behind his back and pinioned them; after which the Shaykh said to him, \"Let him down into the vault under the earth and there leave him and say to my slave girl Such-an-one, 'Torture him night and day and give him a cake of bread to eat morning and evening against the time come of the voyage to the Blue Sea and the Mountain of Fire, whereon we will slaughter him as a sacrifice.'\" So the black carried him out at another door and, raising a flag in the floor, discovered a flight of twenty steps leading to a chamber[FN#382] under the earth, into which he descended with him and, laying his feet in irons, gave him over to the slave girl and went away. Meanwhile, the old men said to one another, \"When the day of the Festival of the Fire cometh, we will sacrifice him on the mountain, as a propitiatory offering whereby we shall pleasure the Fire.\" Presently the damsel went down to him and beat him a grievous beating, till streams of blood flowed from his sides and he fainted; after which she set at his head a scone of bread and a cruse of brackish water and went away and left him. In the middle of the night, he revived and found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating: so he wept bitter tears; and recalling his former condition of honour and prosperity, lordship and dominion, and his separation from his sire and his exile from his native land.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when As'ad found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating he recalled his whilome condition of honour and prosperity and dominion and lordship, and he wept and groaned aloud and recited these couplets,\n\n\"Stand by the ruined stead and ask of us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor deem we dwell there as was state of us:\nThe World, that parter, hath departed us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yet soothes not hate-full hearts the fate of us:\nWith whips a cursed slave girl scourges us, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And teems her breast with rancorous hate of us:\nAllah shall haply deign to unpart our lives, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Chastise our foes, and end this strait of us.\"\n\nAnd when As'ad had spoken his poetry, he put out his hand towards his head and finding there the crust and the cruse full of brackish water he ate a bittock, just enough to keep life in him, and drank a little water, but could get no sleep till morning for the swarms of bugs[FN#383] and lice. As soon as it was day, the slave girl came down to him and changed his clothes, which were drenched with blood and stuck to him, so that his skin came off with the shirt; wherefor he shrieked aloud and cried, \"Alas!\" and said, \"O my God, if this be Thy pleasure, increase it upon me! O Lord, verily Thou art not unmindful of him that oppresseth me; do Thou then avenge me upon him!\" And he groaned and repeated the following verses,\n\n\n\"Patient, O Allah! to Thy destiny *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I bow, suffice me what Thou deign decree:\nPatient to bear Thy will, O Lord of me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Patient to burn on coals of Ghaz\u00e1-tree:\nThey wrong me, visit me with hurt and harm; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply Thy grace from them shall set me free:\nFar be's, O Lord, from thee to spare the wronger *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O Lord of Destiny my hope's in Thee!\"\n\nAnd what another saith,\n\n\"Bethink thee not of worldly state, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Leave everything to course of Fate;\nFor oft a thing that irketh thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall in content eventuate;\nAnd oft what strait is shall expand, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And what expanded is wax strait.\nAllah will do what wills His will *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So be not thou importunate!\nBut 'joy the view of coming weal *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Shall make forget past bale and bate.\"\n\nAnd when he had ended his verse, the slave-girl came down upon him with blows till he fainted again; and, throwing him a flap of bread and a gugglet of saltish water, went away and left him sad and lonely, bound in chains of iron, with the blood streaming from his sides and far from those he loved. So he wept and called to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that As'ad called to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed; so he wept and groaned and complained and poured forth tears in floods and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"Easy, O Fate! how long this wrong, this injury, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Robbing each morn and eve my brotherhood fro' me?\nIs't not time now thou deem this length sufficiency *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Of woes and, O thou Heart of Rock, show clemency?\nMy friends thou wrongedst when thou madst each enemy *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Mock and exult me for thy wrongs, thy tyranny:\nMy foeman's heart is solaced by the things he saw *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   In me, of strangerhood and lonely misery:\nSuffice thee not what came upon my head of dole, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Friends lost for evermore, eyes wan and pale of blee?\nBut must in prison cast so narrow there is naught *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Save hand to bite, with bitten hand for company;\nAnd tears that tempest down like goodly gift of cloud, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And longing thirst whose fires weet no satiety.\nRegretful yearnings, singulfs and unceasing sighs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Repine, remembrance and pain's very ecstacy:\nDesire I suffer sore and melancholy deep, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And I must bide a prey to endless phrenesy:\nI find me ne'er a friend who looks with piteous eye, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And seeks my presence to allay my misery:\nSay, liveth any intimate with trusty love *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Who for mine ills will groan, my sleepless malady?\nTo whom moan I can make and, peradventure, he *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall pity eyes that sight of sleep can never see?\nThe flea and bug suck up my blood, as wight that drinks *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Wine from the proffering hand of fair virginity:\nAmid the lice my body aye remindeth me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of orphan's good in K\u00e1zi's claw of villainy:\nMy home's a sepulchre that measures cubits three, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Where pass I morn and eve in chained agony:\nMy wines are tears, my clank of chains takes music's stead, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cares my dessert of fruit and sorrows are my bed.\"\n\nAnd when he had versed his verse and had prosed his prose, he again groaned and complained and remembered he had been and how he had been parted from his brother. Thus far concerning him; but as regards his brother Amjad, he awaited As'ad till mid-day yet he returned not to him: whereupon Amjad's vitals fluttered, the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he poured forth abundant tears,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirtieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Amjad awaited his brother As'ad till mid-day and he returned not to him, Amjad's vitals fluttered; the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he poured forth abundant tears, exclaiming, \"Alas, my brother! Alas, my friend! Alas my grief! How I feared me we should be separated!\" Then he descended from the mountain-top with the tears running down his cheeks; and, entering the city, ceased not walking till he made the market. He asked the folk the name of the place and concerning its people and they said, \"This is called the City of the Magians, and its citizens are mostly given to Fire-worshipping in lieu of the Omnipotent King.\" Then he enquired of the City of Ebony and they answered, \"Of a truth it is a year's journey thither by land and six months by sea: it was governed erst by a King called Armanus; but he took to son- in-law and made King in his stead a Prince called Kamar al-Zaman distinguished for justice and munificence, equity and benevolence.\" When Amjad heard tell of his father, he groaned and wept and lamented and knew not whither to go. However, he bought a something of food and carried it to a retired spot where he sat down thinking to eat; but, recalling his brother, he fell a- weeping and swallowed but a morsel to keep breath and body together, and that against his will. Then he rose and walked about the city, seeking news of his brother, till he saw a Moslem tailor sitting in his shop so he sat down by him and told him his story; whereupon quoth the tailor, \"If he have fallen into the hands of the Magians, thou shalt hardly see him again: yet it may be Allah will reunite you twain. But thou, O my brother,\" he continued wilt thou lodge with me?\" Amjad answered, \"Yes\"; and the tailor rejoiced at this. So he abode with him many days, what while the tailor comforted him and exhorted him to patience and taught him tailoring, till he became expert in the craft. Now one day he went forth to the sea-shore and washed his clothes; after which he entered the bath and put on clean raiment; then he walked about the city, to divert himself with its sights and presently there met him on the way a woman of passing beauty and loveliness, without peer for grace and comeliness. When she saw him she raised her face-veil and signed to him by moving her eyebrows and her eyes with luring glances, and versified these couplets,\n\n\"I drooped my glance when seen thee on the way *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    As though, O slim-waist! felled by Sol's hot ray:\nThou art the fairest fair that e'er appeared, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Fairer to-day than fair of yesterday:[FN#384]\nWere Beauty parted, a fifth part of it *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With Joseph or a part of fifth would stay;\nThe rest would fly to thee, shine ownest own; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Be every soul thy sacrifice, I pray!\"\n\nWhen Amjad heard these her words, they gladdened his heart which inclined to her and his bowels yearned towards her and the hands of love sported with him; so he sighed to her in reply and spoke these couplets,\n\n\"Above the rose of cheek is thorn of lance;[FN#385] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who dareth pluck it, rashest chevisance?\nStretch not thy hand towards it, for night long *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Those lances marred because we snatched a glance!\nSay her, who tyrant is and tempter too *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     (Though justice might her tempting power enhance):\u2014\nThy face would add to errors were it veiled; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unveiled I see its guard hath best of chance!\nEye cannot look upon Sol's naked face; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But can, when mist-cloud dims his countenance:\nThe honey-hive is held by honey-bee;[FN#386] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ask the tribe-guards what wants their vigilance?\nAn they would slay me, let them end their ire *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rancorous, and grant us freely to advance:\nThey're not more murderous, an charge the whole *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Than charging glance of her who wears the mole.\"\n\nAnd hearing these lines from Amjad she sighed with the deepest sighs and, signing to him again, repeated these couplets,\n\n\"'Tis thou hast trodden coyness path not I: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Grant me thy favours for the time draws nigh:\nO thou who makest morn with light of brow, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And with loosed brow-locks night in lift to stye!\nThine idol-aspect made of me thy slave, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tempting as temptedst me in days gone by:\n'Tis just my liver fry with hottest love: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who worship fire for God must fire aby:\nThou sellest like of me for worthless price; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     If thou must sell, ask high of those who buy.\"\nWhen Amjad heard these her words he said to her, \"Wilt thou come to my lodging or shall I go with thee to shine?\" So she hung her head in shame to the ground and repeated the words of Him whose Name be exalted, \"Men shall have the pre-eminence above women, because of those advantages wherein Allah hath caused the one of them to excel the other.\"[FN#387] Upon this, Amjad took the hint.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Amjad took the woman's hint and understood that she wished to go with him whither he was going; he felt himself bounder to find a place wherein to receive her, but was ashamed to carry her to the house of his host, the tailor. So he walked on and she walked after him, and the two ceased not walking from street to street and place to place, till she was tired and said to him, \"O my lord, where is thy house?\" Answered he, \"Before us a little way.\" Then he turned aside into a handsome by-street, followed by the young woman, and walked on till he came to the end, when he found it was no thoroughfare and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" Then raising his eyes, he saw, at the upper end of the lane a great doer with two stone benches; but it was locked. So Amjad sat down on one of the benches and she on the other; and she said to him, \"O my lord, wherefore waitest thou?\" He bowed his head awhile to the ground then raised it and answered, \"I am awaiting my Mameluke who hath the key; for I bade him make me ready meat and drink and flowers, to deck the wine-service against my return from the bath.\" But he said to himself, \"Haply the time will be tedious to her and she will go about her business, leaving me here, when I will wend my own way.\" However, as soon as she was weary of long waiting, she said, \"O my lord, thy Mameluke delayeth; and here are we sitting in the street;\" and she arose and took a stone and went up to the lock. Said Amjad, \"Be not in haste, but have patience till the servant come.\" However, she hearkened not to him, but smote the wooden bolt with the stone and broke it in half, whereupon the door opened. Quoth he, \"What possessed thee to do this deed?\" Quoth she, \"Pooh, pooh, my lord! what matter it? Is not the house thy house and thy place?\" He said, \"There was no need to break the bolt.\" Then the damsel entered, to the confusion of Amjad, who knew not what to do for fear of the people of the house; but she said to him, \"Why dost thou not enter, O light of mine eyes and core of my heart?\" Replied he, \"I hear and obey; but my servant tarrieth long and I know not if he have done aught of what I bade him and specially enjoined upon him, or not.\" Hereupon he entered, sore in fear of the people of the house, and found himself in a handsome saloon with four dais'd recesses, each facing other, and containing closets and raised seats, all bespread with stuffs of silk and brocade; and in the midst was a jetting fountain of costly fashion, on whose margin rested a covered tray of meats, with a leather tablecloth hanging up and gem-encrusted dishes, full of fruits and sweet- scented flowers. Hard by stood drinking vessels and a candlestick with a single wax-candle therein; and the place was full of precious stuffs and was ranged with chests and stools, and on each seat lay a parcel of clothes upon which was a purse full of monies, gold and silver. The floor was paved with marble and the house bore witness in every part to its owner's fortune. When Amjad saw all this, he was confounded at his case and said to himself, \"I am a lost man! Verily we are Allah's and to Allah we are returning!\" As for the damsel, when she sighted the place she rejoiced indeed with a joy nothing could exceed, and said to him, \"By Allah, O my lord, thy servant hath not failed of his duty; for see, he hath swept the place and cooked the meat and set on the fruit; and indeed I come at the best of times.\" But he paid no heed to her, his heart being taken up with fear of the house- folk; and she said, \"Fie, O my lord, O my heart! What aileth thee to stand thus?\" Then she sighed and, giving him a buss which sounded like the cracking of a walnut, said, \"O my lord, an thou have made an appointment with other than with me, I will gird my middle and serve her and thee. Amjad laughed from a heart full of rage and wrath and came forwards and sat down, panting and saying to himself, \"Alack, mine ill death and doom when the owner of the place shall return!\" Then she seated herself by him and fell to toying and laughing, whilst Amjad sat careful and frowning, thinking a thousand thoughts and communing with himself, \"Assuredly the master of the house cannot but come, and then what shall I say to him? he needs must kill me and my life will be lost thus foolishly.\" Presently she rose and, tucking up her sleeves, took a tray of food on which she laid the cloth and then set it before Amjad and began to eat, saying, \"Eat, O my lord.\" So he came forward and ate; but the food was not pleasant to him; on the contrary he ceased not to look towards the door, till the damsel had eaten her fill, when she took away the tray of the meats and, setting on the dessert, fell to eating of the dried fruits. Then she brought the wine service and opening the jar, filled a cup and handed it to Amjad, who took it from her hand saying to him self, ' Ah, ah! and well away, when the master of the house cometh and seeth me!\"; and he kept his eyes fixed on the threshold, even with cup in hand. While he was in this case, lo! in came the master of the house, who was a white slave, one of the chief men of the city, being Master of the Horse[FN#388] to the King. He had fitted up this saloon for his pleasures, that he might make merry therein and be private with whom he would, and he had that day bidden a youth whom he loved and had made this entertainment for him. Now the name of this slave was Bah\u00e1dur,[FN#389] and he was open of hand, generous, munificent and fain of alms-giving and charitable works.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it wad the Two Hundred and Thirty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Bahadur, the Master of the Horse and the owner of the house, came to the door of the saloon and found it open, he entered slowly and softly and looking in, with head advanced and out stretched neck, saw Amjad and the girl sitting before the dish of fruit and the wine-jar in front of them. Now Amjad at that moment had the cup in his hand and his face turned to the door; and when his glance met Bahadur's eyes his hue turned pale yellow and his side-muscles quivered, so seeing his trouble Bahadur signed to him with his finger on his lips, as much as to say, \"Be silent and come hither to me.\" Whereupon he set down the cup and rose and the damsel cried, \"Whither away?\" He shook his head and, signing to her that he wished to make water, went out into the passage barefoot. Now when he saw Bahadur he knew him for the master of the house; so he hastened to him and, kissing his hands, said to him, \"Allah upon thee, O my lord, ere thou do me a hurt, hear what I have to say.\" Then he told him who he was from first to last and acquainted him with what caused him to quit his native land and royal state, and how he had not entered his house of his free will, but that it was the girl who had broken the lock-bolt and done all this.[FN#390] When Bahadur heard his story and knew that he was a King's son, he felt for him and, taking compassion on him, said, \"Hearken to me, O Amjad, and do what I bid thee and I will guarantee thy safety from that thou fearest; but, if thou cross me, I will kill thee.\" Amjad replied, \"Command me as thou wilt: I will not gainsay thee in aught; no, never, for I am the freedman of thy bounty.\" Rejoined Bahadur, \"Then go back forthwith into the saloon, sit down in thy place and be at peace and at shine ease; I will presently come in to thee, and when thou seest me (remember my name is Bahadur) do thou revile me and rail at me, saying, 'What made thee tarry till so late?' And accept no excuse from me; nay, so far from it, rise and beat me; and, if thou spare me, I will do away thy life. Enter now and make merry and whatsoever thou seekest of me at this time I will bring thee forthwith; and do thou spend this night as thou wilt and on the morrow wend thy way. This I do in honour of thy strangerhood, for I love the stranger and hold myself bounder to do him devoir.\" So Amjad kissed his hand, and, returning to the saloon with his face clad in its natural white and red, at once said to the damsel, \"O my mistress, thy presence hath gladdened this shine own place and ours is indeed a blessed night.\" Quoth the girl, \"Verily I see a wonderful change in thee, that thou now welcomest me so cordially!\" So Amjad answered, \"By Allah, O my lady, methought my servant Bahadur had robbed me of some necklaces of jewels, worth ten thousand diners each; however, when I went out but now in concern for this, I sought for them and found them in their place. I know not why the slave tarrieth so long and needs must I punish him for it.\" She was satisfied with his answer, and they sported and drank and made merry and ceased not to be so till near sundown, when Bahadur came in to them, having changed his clothes and girt his middle and put on shoes, such as are worn of Mamelukes. He saluted and kissed the ground; then held his hands behind him and stood, with his head hanging down, as one who confesseth to a fault. So Amjad looked at him with angry eyes and asked, \"Why hast thou tarried till now, O most pestilent of slaves?\" Answered Bahadur, \"O my lord, I was busy washing my clothes and knew not of thy being here; for our appointed time was nightfall and not day-tide.\" But Amjad cried out at him, saying, \"Thou liest, O vilest of slaves! By Allah, I must needs beat thee.\" So he rose and, throwing Bahadur prone on the ground, took a stick and beat him gently; but the damsel sprang up and, snatching the stick from his hand, came down upon Bahadur so lustily, that in extreme pain the tears ran from his eyes and he ground his teeth together and called out for succour; whilst Amjad cried out to the girl \"Don't\"; and she cried out, \"Let me satisfy my anger upon him!\" till at last he pulled the stick out of her hand and pushed her away. So Bahadur rose and, wiping away his tears from his cheeks, waited upon them the while, after which he swept the hall and lighted the lamps; but as often as he went in and out, the lady abused him and cursed him till Amjad was wroth with her and said, \"For Almighty Allah's sake leave my Mameluke; he is not used to this.\" Then they sat and ceased not eating and drinking (and Bahadur waiting upon them) till midnight when, being weary with service and beating, he fell asleep in the midst of the hall and snored and snorted; whereupon the damsel, who was drunken with wine, said to Amjad, \"Arise, take the sword hanging yonder and cut me off this slave's head; and, if thou do it not, I will be the death of thee!\" \"What possesseth thee to slay my slave?\" asked Amjad; and she answered, \"Our joyaunce will not be complete but by his death. If thou wilt not kill him, I will do it myself.\" Quoth Amjad, \"By Allah's rights to thee, do not this thing!\" Quoth she, \"It must perforce be;\" and, taking down the sword, drew it and made at Bahadur to kill him; but Amjad said in his mind, \"This man hath entreated us courteously and sheltered us and done us kindness and made himself my slave: shall we requite him by slaughtering him? This shall never be!\" Then he said to the woman, \"If my Mameluke must be killed, better I should kill him than thou.\" So saying, he took the sword from her and, raising his hand, smote her on the neck and made her head fly from her body. It fell upon Bahadur who awoke and sat up and opened his eyes, when he saw Amjad standing by him and in his hand the sword dyed with blood, and the damsel lying dead. He enquired what had passed, and Amjad told him all she had said, adding, \"Nothing would satisfy her but she must slay thee; and this is her reward.\" Then Bahadur rose and, kissing the Prince's hand, said to him, \"Would to Heaven thou hadst spared her! but now there is nothing for it but to rid us of her without stay or delay, before the day-break.\" Then he girded his loins and took the body, wrapped it in an Ab\u00e1-cloak and, laying it in a large basket of palm-leaves, he shouldered it saying, \"Thou art a stranger here and knowest no one: so sit thou in this place and await my return till day-break. If I come back to thee, I will assuredly do thee great good service and use my endeavours to have news of thy brother; but if by sunrise I return not, know that all is over with me; and peace be on thee, and the house and all it containeth of stuffs and money are shine.\" Then he fared forth from the saloon bearing the basket; and, threading the streets, he made for the salt sea, thinking to throw it therein: but as he drew near the shore, he turned and saw that the Chief of Police and his officers had ranged themselves around him; and, on recognising him, they wondered and opened the basket, wherein they found the slain woman. So they seized him and laid him in bilboes all that night till the morning, when they carried him and the basket, as it was, to the King and reported the case. The King was sore enraged when he looked upon the slain and said to Bahadur, \"Woe to thee! Thou art always so doing; thou killest folk and castest them into the sea and takest their goods. How many murders hast thou done ere this?\" Thereupon Bahadur hung his head.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bahadur hung down his head groundwards before the King, who cried out at him, saying, \"Woe to thee! Who killed this girl?\" He replied, \"O my lord! I killed her, and there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\"[FN#391] So the King in his anger, commanded to hang him; and the hangman went down with him by the King's commandment, and the Chief of Police accompanied him with a crier who called upon all the folk to witness the execution of Bahadur, the King's Master of the Horse; and on this wise they paraded him through the main streets and the market-streets. This is how it fared with Bahadur; but as regards Amjad, he awaited his host's return till the day broke and the sun rose, and when he saw that he came not, he exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Would I knew what is become of him?\" And, as he sat musing behold, he heard the crier proclaiming Bahadur's sentence and bidding the people to see the spectacle of his hanging at midday; whereat he wept and exclaimed, \"Verily, we are Allah's and to Him we are returning! He meaneth to sacrifice himself unjustly for my sake, when I it was who slew her. By Allah, this shall never be!\" Then he went from the saloon and, shutting the door after him, hurriedly threaded the streets till he overtook Bahadur, when he stood before the Chief of Police and said to him, \"O my lord, put not Bahadur to death, for he is innocent. By Allah, none killed her but I.\" Now when the Captain of Police heard these words, he took them both and, carrying them before the King, acquainted him with what Amjad had said; whereupon he looked at the Prince and asked him, \"Didst thou kill the damsel?\" He answered, \"Yes\" and the King said, \"Tell me why thou killedst her, and speak the truth.\" Replied Amjad, \"O King, it is indeed a marvellous event and a wondrous matter that hath befallen me: were it graven with needles on the eye-corners, it would serve as a warner to whoso would be warned!\" Then he told him his whole story and informed him of all that had befallen him and his brother, first and last; whereat the King was much startled and surprised and said to him, \"Know that now I find thee to be excusable; but list, O youth! Wilt thou be my Waz\u00edr?\" \"Hearkening and obedience,\" answered Amjad whereupon the King bestowed magnificent dresses of honour on him and Bahadur and gave him a handsome house, with eunuchs and officers and all things needful, appointing him stipends and allowances and bidding him make search for his brother As'ad. So Amjad sat down in the seat of the Wazirate and governed and did justice and invested and deposed and took and gave. Moreover, he sent out a crier to cry his brother throughout the city, and for many days made proclamation in the main streets and market-streets, but heard no news of As'ad nor happened on any trace of him. Such was his case; but as regards his brother, the Magi ceased not to torture As'ad night and day and eve and morn for a whole year's space, till their festival drew near, when the old man Bahram[FN#392] made ready for the voyage and fitted out a ship for himself.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bahram, the Magian, having fitted out a ship for the voyage, took As'ad and put him in a chest which he locked and had it transported on board. Now it so came to pass that, at the very time of shipping it, Amjad was standing to divert himself by looking upon the sea; and when he saw the men carrying the gear and shipping it, his heart throbbed and he called to his pages to bring him his beast. Then, mounting with a company of his officers, he rode down to the sea-side and halted before the Magian's ship, which he commended his men to board and search. They did his bidding, and boarded the vessel and rummaged in every part, but found nothing; so they returned and told Amjad, who mounted again and rode back. But he felt troubled in mind; and when he reached his place and entered his palace, he cast his eyes on the wall and saw written thereon two lines which were these couplets,\n\n\"My friends! if ye are banisht from mine eyes, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From heart and mind ye ne'er go wandering:\nBut ye have left me in my woe, and rob *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rest from my eyelids while ye are slumbering.\"\n\nAnd seeing them Amjad thought of his brother and wept. Such was his case; but as for Bahram, the Magian, he embarked and shouted and bawled to his crew to make sail in all haste. So they shook out the sails and departed and ceased not to fare on many days and nights; and, every other day, Bahram took out As'ad and gave him a bit of bread and made him drink a sup of water, till they drew near the Mountain of Fire. Then there came out on them a storm-wind and the sea rose against them, so that the ship was driven out of her course till she took a wrong line and fell into strange waters; and, at last they came in sight of a city builded upon the shore, with a castle whose windows overlooked the main. Now the ruler of this city was a Queen called Marj\u00e1nah, and the captain said to Bahram, \"O my lord, we have strayed from our course and come to the island of Queen Marjanah, who is a devout Moslemah; and, if she know that we are Magians, she will take our ship and slay us to the last man. Yet needs must we put in here to rest and refit.\" Quoth Bahram, \"Right is thy recking, and whatso thou seest fit that will I do!\" Said the ship master, \"If the Queen summon us and question us, how shall we answer her?\"; and Bahram replied, \"Let us clothe this Moslem we have with us in a Mameluke's habit and carry him ashore with us, so that when the Queen sees him, she will suppose and say, 'This is a slave.' As for me I will tell her that I am a slave-dealer[FN#393] who buys and sells white slaves, and that I had with me many but have sold all save this one, whom I retained to keep my accounts, for he can read and write.\" And the captain said \"This device should serve.\" Presently they reached the city and slackened sail and cast the anchors; and the ship lay still, when behold, Queen Marjanah came down to them, attended by her guards and, halting before the vessel, called out to the captain, who landed and kissed the ground before her. Quoth she, \"What is the lading of this thy ship and whom hast thou with thee?\"\" Quoth he, \"O Queen of the Age, I have with me a merchant who dealeth in slaves.\" And she said, \"Hither with him to me\"; whereupon Bahram came ashore to her, with As'ad walking behind him in a slave's habit, and kissed the earth before her. She asked, \"What is thy condition?\"; and he answered, \"I am a dealer in chattels.\" Then she looked at As'ad and, taking him for a Mameluke, asked him, \"What is thy name, O youth?\" He answered, \"Dost thou ask my present or my former name?\" \"Hast thou then two names?\" enquired she, and he replied (and indeed his voice was choked with tears), \"Yes; my name aforetime was Al-As'ad, the most happy, but now it is Al- Mu'tarr\u2014Miserrimus.\" Her heart inclined to him and she said, \"Canst thou write?\" \"Yes,'' answered he, and she gave him ink- case and reed-pen and paper and said to him, \"Write somewhat that I may see it.\" So he wrote these two couplets,\n\n\"What can the slave do when pursued by Fate, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O justest Judge! whatever be his state?[FN#394]\nWhom God throws hand bound in the depths and says, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Beware lest water should thy body wet?\"[FN#395]\n\nNow when she read these lines, she had ruth upon him and said to Bahram, \"Sell me this slave.\" He replied, \"O my lady, I cannot sell him, for I have parted with all the rest and none is left with me but he.\" Quoth the Queen, \"I must need have him of thee, either by sale or way of gift.\" But quoth Bahram, \"I will neither sell him nor give him.\" Whereat she was wroth and, taking As'ad by the hand, carried him up to the castle and sent to Bahram, saying, \"Except thou set sail and depart our city this very night, I will seize all thy goods and break up thy ship.\" Now when the message reached the Magian, he grieved with sore grief and cried, \"Verily this voyage is on no wise to be commended.\" Then he arose and made ready and took all he needed and awaited the coming of the night to resume his voyage, saying to the sailors, \"Provide yourselves with your things and fill your water-skins, that we may set sail at the last of the night.\" So the sailors did their business and awaited the coming of darkness. Such was their case; but as regards Queen Marjanah, when she had brought As'ad into the castle, she opened the casements overlooking the sea and bade her handmaids bring food. They set food before As'ad and herself and both ate, after which the Queen called for wine.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Marjanah bade her handmaids bring wine and they set it before her, she fell to drinking with As'ad. Now, Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) filled her heart with love for the Prince and she kept filling his cup and handing it to him till his reason fled; and presently he rose and left the hall to satisfy a call of nature. As he passed out of the saloon he saw an open door through which he went and walked on till his walk brought him to a vast garden full of all manner fruits and flowers; and, sitting down under a tree, he did his occasion. Then he rose and went up to a jetting fountain in the garden and made the lesser ablution and washed his hands and face, after which he would have risen to go away; but the air smote him and he fell back, with his clothes undone and slept, and night overcame him thus. So far concerning him; but as concerns Bahram, the night being come, he cried out to his crew, saying, \"Set sail and let us away!\"; and the' answered, \"We hear and obey, but wait till we fill our water- skins and then we will set sail.\" So they landed with their water skins and went round about the castle, and found nothing but garden-walls: whereupon they climbed over into the garden and followed the track of feet, which led them to the fountain; and there they found As'ad lying on his back. They knew him and were glad to find him; and, after filling their water-skins, they bore him off and climbed the wall again with him and carried him back in haste to Bahram to whom they said, \"Hear the good tidings of thy winning thy wish; and gladden thy heart and beat thy drums and sound thy pipes; for thy prisoner, whom Queen Marjanah took from thee by force, we have found and brought back to thee\"; and they threw As'ad down before him. When Bahram saw him, his heart leapt for joy and his breast swelled with gladness. Then he bestowed largesse on the sailors and bade them set sail in haste. So they sailed forthright, intending to make the Mountain of Fire and stayed not their course till the morning. This is how it fared with them; but as regards Queen Marjanah, she abode awhile, after As'ad went down from her, awaiting his return in vain for he came not; thereupon she rose and sought him, yet found no trace of him. Then she bade her women light flambeaux and look for him, whilst she went forth in person and, seeing the garden- door open, knew that he had gone thither. So she went out into the garden and finding his sandals lying by the fountain, searched the place in every part, but came upon no sign of him; and yet she gave not over the search till morning. Then she enquired for the ship and they told her, \"The vessel set sail in the first watch of the night\"; wherefor she knew that they had taken As'ad with them, and this was grievous to her and she was sore an-angered. She bade equip ten great ships forthwith and, making ready for fight, embarked in one of the ten with her Mamelukes and slave-women and men-at-arms, all splendidly accoutred and weaponed for war. They spread the sails and she said to the captains, \"If you overtake the Magian's ship, ye shall have of me dresses of honour and largesse of money; but if you fail so to do, I will slay you to the last man.\" Whereat fear and great hope animated the crews and they sailed all that day and the night and the second day and the third day till, on the fourth they sighted the ship of Bahram, the Magian, and before evening fell the Queen's squadron had surrounded it on all sides, just as Bahram had taken As'ad forth of the chest and was beating and torturing him, whilst the Prince cried out for help and deliverance, but found neither helper nor deliverer: and the grievous bastinado sorely tormented him. Now while so occupied, Bahram chanced to look up and, seeing himself encompassed by the Queen's ships, as the white of the eye encompasseth the black, he gave himself up for lost and groaned and said, \"Woe to thee, O As'ad! This is all out of thy head.\" Then taking him by the hand he bade his men throw him overboard and cried, \"By Allah I will slay thee before I die myself!\" So they carried him along by the hands and feet and cast him into the sea and he sank; but Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) willed that his life be saved and that his doom be deferred; so He caused him to sink and rise again and he struck out with his hands and feet, till the Almighty gave him relief, and sent him deliverance; and the waves bore him far from the Magian's ship and threw him ashore. He landed, scarce crediting his escape, and once more on land he doffed his clothes and wrung them and spread them out to dry; whilst he sat naked and weeping over his condition, and bewailing his calamities and mortal dangers, and captivity and stranger hood. And presently he repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"Allah, my patience fails: I have no ward; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My breast is straitened and clean cut my cord;\nTo whom shall wretched slave of case complain *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Save to his Lord? O thou of lords the Lord!\"\n\nThen, having ended his verse, he rose and donned his clothes but he knew not whither to go or whence to come; so he fed on the herbs of the earth and the fruits of the trees and he drank of the streams, and fared on night and day till he came in sight of a city; whereupon he rejoiced and hastened his pace; but when he reached it,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it Was the Two Hundred and Thirty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when he reached the city the shades of evening closed around him and the gates were shut. Now by the decrees of Pate and man's lot this was the very city wherein he had been a prisoner and to whose King his brother Amjad was Minister. When As'ad saw the gate was locked, he turned back and made for the burial-ground, where finding a tomb without a door, he entered therein and lay down and fell asleep, with his face covered by his long sleeve.[FN#396] Meanwhile, Queen Marjanah, coming up with Bahram's ship, questioned him of As'ad. Now the Magian, when Queen Marjanah overtook him with her ships, baffled her by his artifice and gramarye; swearing to her that he was not with him and that he knew nothing of him. She searched the ship, but found no trace of her friend, so she took Bahram and, carrying him back to her castle, would have put him to death, but he ransomed himself from her with all his good and his ship; and she released him and his men. They went forth from her hardly believing in their deliverance, and fared on ten days' journey till they came to their own city and found the gate shut, it being eventide. So they made for the burial-ground, thinking to lie the night there and, going round about the tombs, as Fate and Fortune would have it, saw the building wherein As'ad lay wide open; whereat Bahram marvelled and said, \"I must look into this sepulchre.\" Then he entered and found As'ad lying in a corner fast asleep, with his head covered by his sleeve; so he raised his head, and looking in his face, knew him for the man on whose account he had lost his good and his ship, and cried, \"What! art thou yet alive?\" Then he bound him and gagged him without further parley, and carried him to his house, where he clapped heavy shackles on his feet and lowered him into the underground dungeon aforesaid prepared for the tormenting of Moslems, and he bade his daughter by name Bost\u00e1n,[FN#397] torture him night and day, till the next year, when they would again visit the Mountain of Fire and there offer him up as a sacrifice. Then he beat him grievously and locking the dungeon door upon him, gave the keys to his daughter. By and by, Bostan opened the door and went down to beat him, but finding him a comely youth and a sweet-faced with arched brows and eyes black with nature's Kohl,[FN#398] she fell in love with him and asked him, \"What is thy name?\" \"My name is As'ad,\" answered he; whereat she cried, \"Mayst thou indeed be happy as thy name,[FN#399] and happy be thy days! Thou deservest not torture and blows, and I see thou hast been injuriously entreated.\" And she comforted him with kind words and loosed his bonds. Then she questioned him of the religion of Al-Islam and he told her that it was the true and right Faith and that our lord Mohammed had approved himself by surpassing miracles[FN#400] and signs manifest, and that fire-worship is harmful and not profitable; and he went on to expound to her the tenets of Al-Islam till she was persuaded and the love of the True Faith entered her heart. Then, as Almighty Allah had mixed up with her being a fond affection for As'ad, she pronounced the Two Testimonies[FN#401] of the Faith and became of the people of felicity. After this, she brought him meat and drink and talked with him and they prayed together: moreover, she made him chicken stews and fed him therewith, till he regained strength and his sickness left him and he was restored to his former health. Such things befel him with the daughter of Bahram, the Magian; and so it happened that one day she left him and stood at the house-door when behold, she heard the crier crying aloud and saying, \"Whoso hath with him a handsome young man, whose favour is thus and thus, and bringeth him forth, shall have all he seeketh of money; but if any have him and deny it, he shall be hanged over his own door and his property shall be plundered and his blood go for naught.\" Now As'ad had acquainted Bostan bint Bahram with his whole history: so, when she heard the crier, she knew that it was he who was sought for and, going down to him, told him the news. Then he fared forth and made for the mansion of the Wazir, whom, when As'ad saw, exclaimed, \"By Allah, this Minister is my brother Amjad!\" Then he went up (and the damsel walking behind him) to the Palace, where he again saw his brother, and threw himself upon him; whereupon Amjad also knew him and fell upon his neck and they embraced each other, whilst the Wazir's Mamelukes dismounted and stood round them. They lay awhile insensible and, when they came to themselves, Amjad took his brother and carried him to the Sultan, to whom he related the whole story, and the Sultan charged him to plunder Bahram's house.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Sultan ordered Amjad to plunder Bahram's house and to hang its owner. So Amjad despatched thither for that purpose a company of men, who sacked the house and took Bahram and brought his daughter to the Wazir by whom she was received with all honour, for As'ad had told his brother the torments he had suffered and the kindness she had done him. Thereupon Amjad related in his turn to As'ad all that had passed between himself and the damsel; and how he had escaped hanging and had become Wazir; and they made moan, each to other, of the anguish they had suffered for separation. Then the Sultan summoned Bahram and bade strike off his head; but he said, \"O most mighty King, art thou indeed resolved to put me to death?\" Replied the King, \"Yes, except thou save thyself by becoming a Moslem.\" Quoth Bahram, \"O King, bear with me a little while!\" Then he bowed his head groundwards and presently raising it again, made pro fession of The Faith and islamised at the hands of the Sultan. They all rejoiced at his conversion and Amjad and As'ad told him all that had befallen them, whereat he wondered and said, \"O my lords, make ready for the journey and I will depart with you and carry you back to your father's court in a ship.\" At this they rejoiced and wept with sore weeping but he said, \"O my lords, weep not for your departure, for it shall reunite you with those you love, even as were Ni'amah and Naomi.\" \"And what befel Ni'amah and Naomi?\" asked they. \"They tell,\" replied Bahram, \"(but Allah alone is All knowing) the following tale of\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n\n\n[FN#221] The \"topothesia\" is worthy of Shakespeare's day. \"Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1n\" is evidently a corruption of \"Kh\u00e1lidat\u00e1ni\" (for Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1t), the Eternal, as Ibn Wardi calls the Fortunate Islands, or Canaries, which owe both their modern names to the classics of Europe. Their present history dates from A.D. 1385, unless we accept the Dieppe-Rouen legend of Labat which would place the discovery in A.D. 1326. I for one thoroughly believe in the priority on the West African Coast, of the gallant descendants of the Northmen.\n\n[FN#222] Four wives are allowed by Moslem law and for this reason. If you marry one wife she holds herself your equal, answers you and \"gives herself airs\"; two are always quarrelling and making a hell of the house; three are \"no company\" and two of them always combine against the nicest to make her hours bitter. Four are company, they can quarrel and \"make it up\" amongst themselves, and the husband enjoys comparative peace. But the Moslem is bound by his law to deal equally with the four, each must have her dresses her establishment and her night, like her sister wives. The number is taken from the Jews (Arbah Turim Ev. Hazaer, i.) \"the wise men have given good advice that a man should not marry more than four wives.\" Europeans, knowing that Moslem women are cloistered and appear veiled in public, begin with believing them to be mere articles of luxury, and only after long residence they find out that nowhere has the sex so much real liberty and power as in the Moslem East. They can possess property and will it away without the husband's leave: they can absent themselves from the house for a month without his having a right to complain; and they assist in all his counsels for the best of reasons: a man can rely only on his wives and children, being surrounded by rivals who hope to rise by his ruin. As regards political matters the Circassian women of Constantinople really rule the Sultanate and there soignez la femme! is the first lesson of getting on in the official world.\n\n[FN#223] This two-bow prayer is common on the bride-night; and at all times when issue is desired.\n\n[FN#224] The older Camaralzaman=\"Moon of the age.\" Kamar is the moon between her third and twenty-sixth day: Hil\u00e1l during the rest of the month: Badr (plur. Bud\u00far whence the name of the Princess) is the full moon.\n\n[FN#225] Arab \"Ra'\u00e1y\u00e1\" plur. of 'Ra'\u00edyat\" our Anglo-Indian Ryot, lit. a liege, a subject; secondarily a peasant, a Fellah.\n\n[FN#226] Another audacious parody of the Moslem \"testification\" to the one God, and to Mohammed the Apostle.\n\n[FN#227] Showing how long ago forts were armed with metal plates which we have applied to war-ships only of late years.\n\n[FN#228] The comparison is abominably true\u2014in the East.\n\n[FN#229] Two fallen angels who taught men the art of magic. They are mentioned in the Koran (chaps. ii.), and the commentators have extensively embroidered the simple text. Popularly they are supposed to be hanging by their feet in a well in the territory of Babel, hence the frequent allusions to \"Babylonian sorcery\" in Moslem writings; and those who would study the black art at head-quarters are supposed to go there. They are counterparts of the Egyptian Jamnes and Mambres, the Jannes and Jambres of St. Paul (2 Tim. iii. 8).\n\n[FN#230] An idol or idols of the Arabs (Allat and Ozza) before Mohammed (Koran chaps. ii. 256). Etymologically the word means \"error\" and the termination is rather Hebraic than Arabic.\n\n[FN#231] Arab. \"Khayt hamay\u00e1n\" (wandering threads of vanity), or\nMukh\u00e1t al-Shaytan (Satan's snivel),=our \"gossamer\"=God's summer\n(Mutter Gottes Sommer) or God's cymar (?).\n\n[FN#232] These lines occur in Night xvii.; so I borrow from\nTorrens (p. 163) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#233] A posture of peculiar submission; contrasting strongly with the attitude afterwards assumed by Prince Charming.\n\n[FN#234] A mere term of vulgar abuse not reflecting on either parent: I have heard a mother call her own son, \"Child of adultery.\"\n\n[FN#235] Arab. \"Ghaz\u00e1,\" the Artemisia (Euphorbia ?) before noticed. If the word be a misprint for Ghad\u00e1 it means a kind of Euphorbia which, with the Ar\u00e1k (wild caper-tree) and the Daum palm (Crucifera thebiaca), is one of the three normal growths of the Arabian desert (Pilgrimage iii. 22).\n\n[FN#236] Arab. \"Ban\u00e1t al-Na'ash,\" usually translated daughters of the bier, the three stars which represent the horses in either Bear, \"Charles' Wain,\" or Ursa Minor, the waggon being supposed to be a bier. \"Ban\u00e1t\" may be also sons, plur. of Ibn, as the word points to irrational objects. So Job (ix. 9 and xxxviii. 32) refers to U. Major as \"Ash\" or \"Aysh\" in the words, \"Canst thou guide the bier with its sons?\" (erroneously rendered \"Arcturus with his sons\") In the text the lines are enigmatical, but apparently refer to a death parting.\n\n[FN#237] The Chapters are: 2, 3, 36, 55, 67 and the two last (\"Daybreak\" cxiii. and \"Men\" cxiv.), which are called Al-Mu'izzat\u00e1ni (vulgar Al-Mu'izzatayn), the \"Two Refuge-takings or Preventives,\" because they obviate enchantment. I have translated the two latter as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Say:\u2014Refuge I take with the Lord of the Day-break *\nfrom mischief of what He did make *\nfrom mischief of moon eclipse-showing *\nand from mischief of witches on cord-knots blowing *\nand from mischief of envier when envying.\"\n\n\"Say:\u2014Refuge I take with the Lord of men *\nthe sovran of men *\nthe God of men *\nfrom the Tempter, the Demon *\nwho tempteth in whisper the breasts of men *\nand from Jinnis and (evil) men.\"\n\n[FN#238] The recitations were N\u00e1filah, or superogatory, two short chapters only being required and the taking refuge was because he slept in a ruin, a noted place in the East for Ghuls as in the West for ghosts.\n\n[FN#239] Lane (ii. 222) first read \"M\u00faroozee\" and referred it to the Mur\u00faz tribe near Herat he afterwards (iii. 748) corrected it to \"Marwazee,\" of the fabric of Marw (Margiana) the place now famed for \"Mervousness.\" As a man of Rayy (Rhages) becomes R\u00e1z\u00ed (e.g. Ibn F\u00e1ris al-Raz\u00ed), so a man of Marw is Mar\u00e1zi, not Mur\u00fazi nor M\u00e1rwazi. The \"Mikna' \" was a veil forming a kind of \"respirator,\" defending from flies by day and from mosquitos, dews and draughts by night. Easterns are too sensible to sleep with bodies kept warm by bedding, and heads bared to catch every blast. Our grandfathers and grandmothers did well to wear bonnets-de-nuit, however ridiculous they may have looked.\n\n[FN#240] Iblis, meaning the Despairer, is called in the Koran (chaps. xviii. 48) \"One of the genii (Jinnis) who departed from the command of his Lord.\" Mr. Rodwell (in loco) notes that the Satans and Jinnis represent in the Koran (ii. 32, etc.) the evil-principle and finds an admixture of the Semitic Satans and demons with the \"Genii from the Persian (Babylonian ?) and Indian (Egyptian ?) mythologies.\"\n\n[FN#241] Of course she could not see his eyes when they were shut; nor is this mere Eastern inconsequence. The writer means, \"had she seen them, they would have showed,\" etc.\n\n[FN#242] The eyes are supposed to grow darker under the influence of wine and sexual passion.\n\n[FN#243] To keep off the evil eye.\n[FN#244] Like Dahnash this is a fanciful P. N., fit only for a Jinni. As a rule the appellatives of Moslem \"genii\" end in\u00fas (oos), as Tarn\u00fas, Huliy\u00e1nus, the Jewish in\u2014nas, as Jattunas; those of the Tars\u00e1 (the \"funkers\" i.e. Christians) in\u2014d\u00fas, as Sid\u00fas, and the Hindus in\u2014t\u00fas, as Nakt\u00fas (who entered the service of the Prophet Shays, or Seth, and was converted to the Faith). The King of the Genii is Malik Katsh\u00e1n who inhabits Mount Kaf; and to the west of him lives his son-in-law, Abd al-Rahman with 33,000 domestics: these names were given by the Apostle Mohammed. \"Baktan\u00fas\" is lord of three Moslem troops of the wandering Jinns, which number a total of twelve bands and extend from Sind to Europe. The Jinns, Divs, Peris (\"fairies\") and other pre-Adamitic creatures were governed by seventy-two Sultans all known as Sulayman and the last I have said was J\u00e1n bin J\u00e1n. The angel H\u00e1ris was sent from Heaven to chastise him, but in the pride of victory he also revolted with his followers the Jinns whilst the Peris held aloof. When he refused to bow down before Adam he and his chiefs were eternally imprisoned but the other Jinns are allowed to range over earth as a security for man's obedience. The text gives the three orders. flyers. walkers and divers.\n\n[FN#245] i.e. distracted (with love); the Lakab, or poetical name, of apparently a Spanish poet.\n\n[FN#246] Nothing is more \"anti-pathetic\" to Easterns than lean hips and flat hinder-cheeks in women and they are right in insisting upon the characteristic difference of the male and female figure. Our modern sculptors and painters, whose study of the nude is usually most perfunctory, have often scandalised me by the lank and greyhound-like fining off of the frame, which thus becomes rather simian than human.\n\n[FN#247] The small fine foot is a favourite with Easterns as well as Westerns. Ovid (A.A.) is not ashamed \"ad teneros Oscula (not basia or suavia) ferre pedes.\" Ariosto ends the august person in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Il breve, asciutto, e ritondetto piece,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (The short-sized, clean-cut, roundly-moulded foot).\n\nAnd all the world over it is a sign of \"blood,\" i.e. the fine nervous temperament.\n\n[FN#248] i.e. \"full moons\": the French have corrupted it to\n\"Badoure\"; we to \"Badoura.\" winch is worse.\n\n[FN#249] As has been said a single drop of urine renders the clothes ceremoniously impure, hence a Stone or a handful of earth must be used after the manner of the torche-cul. Scrupulous Moslems, when squatting to make water, will prod the ground before them with the point o f stick or umbrella, so as to loosen it and prevent the spraying of the urine.\n\n[FN#250] It is not generally known to Christians that Satan has a wife called Aww\u00e1 (\"Haww\u00e1\" being the Moslem Eve) and, as Adam had three sons, the Tempter has nine, viz., Zu 'l-baysun who rules in bazars. Wassin who prevails in times of trouble. Awan who counsels kings; Haffan patron of wine-bibbers; Marrah of musicians and dancers; Masbut of news-spreaders (and newspapers ?); Dulh\u00e1n who frequents places of worship and interferes with devotion. Dasim, lord of mansions and dinner tables, who prevents the Faithful saying \"Bismillah\" and \"Inshallah,\" as commanded in the Koran (xviii. 23), and Lak\u00eds, lord of Fire worshippers (Herklots, chap. xxix. sect. 4).\n\n[FN#251] Strong perfumes, such as musk (which we Europeans dislike and suspect), are always insisted upon in Eastern poetry, and Mohammed's predilection for them is well known. Moreover the young and the beautiful are held (justly enough) to exhale a natural fragrance which is compared with that of the blessed in Paradise. Hence in the Mu'allakah of Imr al-Keys:\u2014\n\nBreathes the scent of musk when they rise to rove, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    As the Zephyr's breath with the flavour o'clove.\n\nIt is made evident by dogs and other fine-nosed animals that every human being has his, or her, peculiar scent which varies according to age and health. Hence animals often detect the approach of death.\n\n[FN#252] Arab. \"Kahl\u00e1.\" This has been explained. Mohammed is said to have been born with \"Kohl'd eyes.\"\n\n[FN#253] Haw\u00e1 al-'uzr\u00ed, before noticed (Night cxiv.).\n\n[FN#254] These lines, with the N\u00e1zir (eye or steward), the H\u00e1jib (Groom of the Chambers or Chamberlain) and Joseph, are also repeated from Night cxiv. For the Nazir see Al-Hariri (Nos. xiii. and xxii.)\n\n[FN#255] The usual allusion to the H\u00far (Houris) from \"Hangar,\" the white and black of the eye shining in contrast. The Persian Magi also placed in their Heaven (Bihisht or Minu) \"Huran,\" or black-eyed nymphs, under the charge of the angel Zamiy\u00e1d.\n\n[FN#256] In the first hemistich, \"bi-shitt 'it w\u00e1dy\" (by the wady-bank): in the second, \"wa shatta 'l w\u00e1dy\" (\"and my slayer\"\u2014 i.e. w\u00e1dy act. part. of wady, killing\u2014\"hath paced away\").\n\n[FN#257] The double entendre is from the proper names Bud\u00far and Su'\u00e1d (Beatrice) also meaning \"auspicious (or blessed) full moons.\"\n\n[FN#258] Arab. \"H\u00e1zir\" (also Ahl al-hazer, townsmen) and B\u00e1di, a Badawi, also called \"Ahl al-Wabar,\" people of the camel's hair (tent) and A'ar\u00e1b (Nomadic) as opposed to Arab (Arab settled or not). They still boast with Ibn Abbas, cousin of Mohammed, that they have kerchiefs (not turbands) for crowns, tents for houses, loops for walls, swords for scarves and poems for registers or written laws.\n\n[FN#259] This is a peculiarity of the Jinn tribe when wearing hideous forms. It is also found in the Hindu Rakshasa.\n\n[FN#260] Which, by the by, are small and beautifully shaped. The animal is very handy with them, as I learnt by experience when trying to \"Rareyfy\" one at Bayrut.\n\n[FN#261] She being daughter of Al-Dimiry\u00e1t, King of the Jinns.\nMr. W. F. Kirby has made him the subject of a pretty poem.\n\n[FN#262] These lines have occurred in Night xxii. I give\nTorrens's version (p. 223) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#263] Arab. \"K\u00e1mat Alfiyyah,\" like an Alif, the first of the Arabic alphabet, the Heb. Aleph. The Arabs, I have said, took the flag or water leaf form and departed very far from the Egyptian original (we know from Plutarch that the hieroglyphic abecedarium began with \"a\"), which was chosen by other imitators, namely the bull's head, and which in the cursive form, especially the Phnician, became a yoke. In numerals \"Alif\" denotes one or one thousand. It inherits the traditional honours of Alpha (as opposed to Omega) and in books, letters and writings generally it is placed as a monogram over the \"Bismillah,\" an additional testimony to the Unity. (See vol. i. p. 1.) In medi\u00e6val Christianity this place of honour was occupied by the cross: none save the wildest countries have preserved it, but our vocabulary still retains Criss' (Christ-)cross Row, for horn-book, on account of the old alphabet and nine digits disposed in the form of a Latin cross. Hence Tickell (\"The Horn-book\"):\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        \u2014\u2014Mortals ne'er shall know\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        More than contained of old the Chris'-cross Row.\n\n[FN#264] The young man must have been a demon of chastity.\n\n[FN#265] Arab. \"Kir\u00e1t\" from i.e. bean, the seed of the Abrus precatorius, in weight=two to three (English) grains; and in length=one finger-breadth here; 24 being the total. The Moslem system is evidently borrowed from the Roman \"as\" and \"uncia.\"\n\n[FN#266] Names of women.\n\n[FN#267] Arab. \"Amsa\" (lit. he passed the evening) like \"asbaha\" (he rose in the morning) \"Azh\u00e1\" (he spent the forenoon) and \"bata\" (he spent the night), are idiomatically used for \"to be in any state, to continue\" without specification of time or season.\n\n[FN#268] Lit. \"my liver ;\" which viscus, and not the heart, is held the seat of passion, a fancy dating from the oldest days. Theocritus says of Hercules, \"In his liver Love had fixed a wound\" (Idyl. xiii.). In the Anthologia \"Cease, Love, to wound my liver and my heart\" (lib. vii.). So Horace (Odes, i. 2); his Latin Jecur and the Persian \"Jigar\" being evident congeners. The idea was long prevalent and we find in Shakespeare:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         Alas, then Love may be called appetite,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         No motion of the liver but the palate.\n\n[FN#269] A marvellous touch of nature, love ousting affection; the same trait will appear in the lover and both illustrate the deep Italian saying, \"Amor discende, non ascende.\" The further it goes down the stronger it becomes as of grand-parent for grand-child and vice versa.\n\n[FN#270] This tenet of the universal East is at once fact and unfact. As a generalism asserting that women's passion is ten times greater than man's (Pilgrimage, ii. 282), it is unfact. The world shows that while women have more philoprogenitiveness, men have more amativeness; otherwise the latter would not propose and would nurse the doll and baby. Pact, however, in low-lying lands, like Persian Mazanderan versus the Plateau; Indian Malabar compared with Mar\u00e1tha-land; California as opposed to Utah and especially Egypt contrasted with Arabia. In these hot damp climates the venereal requirements and reproductive powers of the female greatly exceed those of the male; and hence the dissoluteness of morals would be phenomenal, were it not obviated by seclusion, the sabre and the revolver. In cold-dry or hot-dry mountainous lands the reverse is the case; hence polygamy there prevails whilst the low countries require polyandry in either form, legal or illegal (i,e. prostitution) I have discussed this curious point of \"geographical morality\" (for all morality is, like conscience, both geographical and chronological), a subject so interesting to the lawgiver, the student of ethics and the anthropologist, in \"The City of the Saints \" But strange and unpleasant truths progress slowly, especially in England.\n\n[FN#271] This morning evacuation is considered, in the East, a sine qu\u00e2 non of health; and old Anglo-Indians are unanimous in their opinion of the \"bard fajar\" (as they mispronounce the dawn-clearance). The natives of India, Hind\u00fas (pagans) and Hind\u00eds (Moslems), unlike Europeans, accustom themselves to evacuate twice a day, evening as well as morning. This may, perhaps, partly account for their mildness and effeminacy; for:\u2014\n\nC'est la constipation qui rend l'homme rigoureux.\n\nThe English, since the first invasion of cholera, in October, 1831, are a different race from their costive grandparents who could not dine without a \"dinner-pill.\" Curious to say the clyster is almost unknown to the people of Hindostan although the barbarous West Africans use it daily to \"wash 'um belly,\" as the Bonney-men say. And, as Sonnini notes to propose the process in Egypt under the Beys might have cost a Frankish medico his life.\n\n[FN#272] The Egyptian author cannot refrain from this characteristic polissonnerie; and reading it out is always followed by a roar of laughter. Even serious writers like Al- Hariri do not, as I have noted, despise the indecency.\n\n[FN#273] \"'Long beard and little wits,\" is a saying throughout the East where the Kausaj (= man with thin, short beard) is looked upon as cunning and tricksy. There is a venerable Joe Miller about a schoolmaster who, wishing to singe his long beard short, burnt it off and his face to boot:\u2014which reminded him of the saying. A thick beard is defined as one which wholly conceals the skin; and in ceremonial ablution it must be combed out with the fingers till the water reach the roots. The Sunnat, or practice of the Prophet, was to wear the beard not longer than one hand and two fingers' breadth. In Persian \"K\u00faseh\" (thin beard) is an insulting term opposed to \"Khush-r\u00edsh,\" a well-bearded man. The Iranian growth is perhaps the finest in the world, often extending to the waist; but it gives infinite trouble, requiring, for instance, a bag when travelling. The Arab beard is often composed of two tufts on the chin-sides and straggling hairs upon the cheeks; and this is a severe mortification, especially to Shaykhs and elders, who not only look upon the beard as one of man's characteristics, but attach a religious importance to the appendage. Hence the enormity of Kamar al-Zaman's behaviour. The Persian festival of the vernal equinox was called Kusehnish\u00edn (Thin-beard sitting). An old man with one eye paraded the streets on an ass with a crow in one hand and a scourge and fan in the other, cooling himself, flogging the bystanders and crying heat! heat! (garm\u00e1! garm\u00e1!). For other particulars see Richardson (Dissertation, p. Iii.). This is the Italian Giorno delle Vecchie, Thursday in Mid Lent, March 12 (1885), celebrating the death of Winter and the birth of Spring.\n\n[FN#274] I quote Torrens (p. 400) as these lines have occurred in\nNight xxxviii.\n\n[FN#275] Moslems have only two names for week days, Friday,\nAl-Jum'ah or meeting-day, and Al-Sabt, Sabbath day, that is\nSaturday. The others are known by numbers after Quaker fashion\nwith us, the usage of Portugal and Scandinavia.\n\n[FN#276] Our last night.\n\n[FN#277] Arab. \"Tayf\"=phantom, the nearest approach to our \"ghost,\" that queer remnant of Fetishism imbedded in Christianity; the phantasma, the shade (not the soul) of tile dead. Hence the accurate Niebuhr declares, \"apparitions (i.e., of the departed) are unknown in Arabia.\" Haunted houses are there tenanted by Ghuls, Jinns and a host of supernatural creatures; but not by ghosts proper; and a man may live years in Arabia before he ever hears of the \"Tayf.\" With the Hindus it is otherwise (Pilgrimage iii. 144). Yet the ghost, the embodied fear of the dead and of death is common, in a greater or less degree, to all peoples; and, as modern Spiritualism proves, that ghost is not yet laid.\n\n[FN#278] Mr. Payne (iii. 133) omits the lines which are \u00e0propos de rein and read much like \"nonsense verses.\" I retain them simply because they are in the text.\n\n[FN#279] The first two couplets are the quatrain (or octave) in\nNight xxxv.\n\n[FN#280] Arab. \"Ar'ar,\" the Heb. \"Aroer,\" which Luther and the A.\nV. translate \"heath.\" The modern Aramaic name is \"Lizz\u00e1b\"\n(Unexplored Syria. i. 68).\n\n[FN#281] In the old version and the Bresl. Edit. (iii. 220) the\nPrincess beats the \"Kahram\u00e1nah,\" but does not kill her.\n\n[FN#282] 'This is still the popular Eastern treatment of the insane.\n\n[FN#283] Pers. \"Marz-b\u00e1n\" = Warden of the Marches, Margrave. The foster-brother in the East is held dear as, and often dearer than, kith and kin.\n\n[FN#284] The moderns believe most in the dawn-dream.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        \u2014Quirinus\n\nPost mediam noctem visus, quum somnia vera.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          (Horace Sat. i. 10, 33,)\n\n[FN#285] The Bresl.

Both are used by Nizami and Al-Hariri, the most \"elegant\" of Arab writers.\n\n[FN#287] These form a Kas\u00eddah, Ode or Elegy= rhymed couplets numbering more than thirteen: If shorter it is called a \"Ghazal.\" I have not thought it necessary to preserve the monorhyme.\n\n[FN#288] Sulaym\u00e1 dim. of Salm\u00e1= any beautiful woman Rab\u00e1b = the viol mostly single stringed: Tan'oum=she who is soft and gentle.

The distich is highly fanciful and the conceits would hardly occur to a\n\n[FN#290] Arab. \"Andam,\" a term applied to Brazil-wood (also called \"Bakkam\") and to \"dragon's blood,\" but not, I think, to tragacanth, the \"goat's thorn,\" which does not dye. Andam is often mentioned in The Nights.\n\n[FN#291] The superior merit of the first (explorer, etc.) is a lieu commun with Arabs. So Al-Hariri in Preface quotes his predecessor:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Justly of praise the price I pay;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          The praise is his who leads the way.\n\n[FN#292] There were two Lukmans, of whom more in a future page.\n\n[FN#293] This symbolic action is repeatedly mentioned in The\nNights.\n\n[FN#294] Arab. \"Shakhs\"=a person, primarily a dark spot. So \"Saw\u00e1d\"=blackness, in Al-Hariri means a group of people who darken the ground by their shade.\n\n[FN#295] The first bath after sickness, I have said, is called\n\"Ghusl al-Sihhah,\"\u2014the Washing of Health.\n\n[FN#296] The words \"malady\" and \"disease\" are mostly avoided during these dialogues as ill-omened words which may bring on a relapse.\n\n[FN#297] Solomon's carpet of green silk which carried him and all his host through the air is a Talmudic legend generally accepted in Al-Islam though not countenanced by the Koran. chaps xxvii. When the \"gnat's wing\" is mentioned, the reference is to Nimrod who, for boasting that he was lord of all, was tortured during four hundred years by a gnat sent by Allah up his ear or nostril.\n\n[FN#298] The absolute want of morality and filial affection in the chaste young man is supposed to be caused by the violence of his passion, and he would be pardoned because he \"loved much.\"\n\n[FN#299] I have noticed the geomantic process in my \"History of Sindh\" (chaps. vii.). It is called \"Zarb al-Ram!\" (strike the sand, the French say \"frapper le sable\") because the rudest form is to make on the ground dots at haphazard, usually in four lines one above the other: these are counted and, if even-numbered, two are taken ( ** ); if odd one ( * ); and thus the four lines will form a scheme say * * * * * * This is repeated three times, producing the same number of figures; and then the combination is sought in an explanatory table or, if the practitioner be expert, he pronounces off-hand. The Nights speak of a \"Takht Raml\" or a board, like a schoolboy's slate, upon which the dots are inked instead of points in sand. The moderns use a \"Kura'h,\" or oblong die, upon whose sides the dots, odd and even, are marked; and these dice are hand-thrown to form the e figure. By way of complication Geomancy is mixed up with astrology and then it becomes a most complicated kind of ariolation and an endless study. \"Napoleon's Book of Fate,\" a chap-book which appeared some years ago, was Geomancy in its simplest and most ignorant shape. For the rude African form see my Mission to Dahome, i. 332, and for that of Darfour, pp. 360-69 of Shaykh Mohammed's Voyage before quoted.\n\n[FN#300] Translators understand this of writing marriage contracts; I take it in a more general sense.\n\n[FN#301] These lines are repeated from Night Ixxv.: with Mr. Payne's permission I give his rendering (iii. 153) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#302] The comparison is characteristically Arab.\n\n[FN#303] Not her \"face\": the head, and especially the back of the head, must always be kept covered, even before the father.\n\n[FN#304] Arab. \"Siw\u00e1k\"=a tooth-stick; \"Siw\u00e1-ka\"=lit. other than thou.\n\n[FN#305] Arab. \"Ar\u00e1k\"=tooth stick of the wild caper-tree; \"Ar\u00e1-ka\" lit.=I see thee. The capparis spinosa is a common desert-growth and the sticks about a span long (usually called Misw\u00e1k), are sold in quantities at Meccah after being dipped in Zemzem water. In India many other woods are used, date-tree, Salvadora, Achyrantes, phyllanthus, etc. Amongst Arabs peculiar efficacy accompanies the tooth-stick of olive, \"the tree springing from Mount Sinai\" (Koran xxiii. 20); and Mohammed would use no other, because it prevents decay and scents the mouth. Hence Koran, chaps. xcv. 1. The \"Misw\u00e1k\" is held with the unused end between the ring-finger and minimus, the two others grasp the middle and the thumb is pressed against the back close to the lips. These articles have long been sold at the Medical Hall near the \"Egyptian Hall,\" Piccadilly. They are better than our unclean tooth-brushes because each tooth gets its own especial rubbing' not a general sweep; at the same time the operation is longer and more troublesome. In parts of Africa as well as Asia many men walk about with the tooth-stick hanging by a string from the neck.\n\n[FN#306] The \"Mehari,\" of which the Algerine-French speak, are the dromedaries bred by the Mahrah tribe of Al-Yaman, the descendants of Mahrat ibn Haydan. They are covered by small wild camels (?) called Al-H\u00fash, found between Oman and Al-Shihr: others explain the word to mean \"stallions of the Jinns \" and term those savage and supernatural animals, \"Naj\u00e1ib al-Mahriyah\"nobles of the Mahrah.\n\n[FN#307] Arab. \"Khaznah\"=a thousand purses; now about \u00a35000. It denotes a large sum of money, like the \"Badrah,\" a purse containing 10,000 dirhams of silver (Al-Hariri), or 80,000 (Burckhardt Prov. 380); whereas the \"Nis\u00e1b\" is a moderate sum of money, gen. 20 gold dinars=200 silver dirhams.\n\n[FN#308] As The Nights show, Arabs admire slender forms; but the hips and hinder cheeks must be highly developed and the stomach fleshy rather than lean. The reasons are obvious. The Persians who exaggerate everything say e.g. (Husayn V\u00e1iz in the Anv\u00e1r-i-Suhayli):\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          How paint her hips and waist ? Who saw\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          A mountain (Koh) dangling to a straw (k\u00e1h)?\n\nIn Antar his beloved Abla is a tamarisk (T. Orientalis). Others compare with the palm-tree (Solomon), the Cypress (Persian, esp. Hafiz and Firdausi) and the Ar\u00e1k or wild Capparis (Arab.).\n\n[FN#309] Ubi aves ibi angel). All African travellers know that a few birds flying about the bush, and a few palm-trees waving in the wind, denote the neighbourhood of a village or a camp (where angels are scarce). The reason is not any friendship for man but because food, animal and vegetable, is more plentiful Hence Albatrosses, Mother Carey's (Mater Cara, the Virgin) chickens, and Cape pigeons follow ships.\n\n[FN#310] The stanza is called Al-Mukhammas=cinquains; the quatrains and the \"bob,\" or \"burden\" always preserve the same consonance. It ends with a Koranic lieu commun of Moslem morality.\n\n[FN#311] Moslem port towns usually have (or had) only two gates. Such was the case with Bayrut, Tyre, Sidon and a host of others; the faubourg-growth of modern days has made these obsolete. The portals much resemble the entrances of old Norman castles\u2014Arques for instance. (Pilgrimage i. 185.)\n\n[FN#312] Arab. \"Lis\u00e1m\"; before explained.\n\n[FN#313] i.e. Life of Souls (persons, etc.).\n\n[FN#314] Arab. \"Ins\u00e1nu-h\u00e1\"=her (i.e. their) man: i.e. the babes of the eyes: the Assyrian Ishon, dim. of Ish=Man; which the Hebrews call \"B\u00e1bat\" or \"Bit\" (the daughter) the Arabs \"Bubu (or Hadakat) al-Aye\"; the Persians \"Mardumak-i-chashm\" (mannikin of the eye); the Greeks and the Latins pupa, pupula, pupilla. I have noted this in the Lyricks of Camoens (p. 449).\n\n[FN#315] Ma'an bin Z\u00e1'idah, a soldier and statesman of the eighth century.\n\n[FN#316] The mildness of the Caliph Mu'\u00e1wiyah, the founder of the Ommiades, proverbial among the Arabs, much resembles the \"meekness\" of Moses the Law-giver, which commentators seem to think has been foisted into Numbers xii. 3.\n\n[FN#317] Showing that there had been no consummation of the marriage which would have demanded \"Ghusl,\" or total ablution, at home or in the Hammam.\n\n[FN#318] I have noticed this notable desert-growth.\n\n[FN#319] 'The \"situation\" is admirable, solution appearing so difficult and catastrophe imminent.\n\n[FN#320] This quatrain occurs in Night ix.: I have borrowed from\nTorrens (p. 79) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#321] The belief that young pigeon's blood resembles the virginal discharge is universal; but the blood most resembling man's is that of the pig which in other points is so very human. In our day Arabs and Hindus rarely submit to inspection the nuptial sheet as practiced by the Israelites and Persians. The bride takes to bed a white kerchief with which she staunches the blood and next morning the stains are displayed in the Harem. In Darfour this is done by the bridegroom. \"Prima Venus debet esse cruenta,\" say the Easterns with much truth, and they have no faith in our complaisant creed which allows the hymen-membrane to disappear by any but one accident.\n\n[FN#322] Not meaning the two central divisions commanded by the\nKing and his Wazir.\n\n[FN#323] Ironic\u00e8.\n\n[FN#324] Arab. \"Rasy\"=praising in a funeral sermon.\n\n[FN#325] Arab. \"Man\u00e1y\u00e1,\" plur. of \"Maniyat\" = death. Mr. R. S. Poole (the Academy, April 26, 1879) reproaches Mr. Payne for confounding \"Muniyat\" (desire) with \"Maniyat\" (death) but both are written the same except when vowel-points are used.\n\n[FN#326] Arab. \"Iddat,\" alluding to the months of celibacy which, according to Moslem law, must be passed by a divorced woman before she can re-marry.\n\n[FN#327] Arab. \"Tal\u00e1k bi'l-Sal\u00e1sah\"=a triple divorce which cannot be revoked; nor can the divorcer re-marry the same woman till after consummation with another husband. This subject will continually recur.\n\n[FN#328] An allusion to a custom of the pagan Arabs in the days of ignorant Heathenism The blood or brain, soul or personality of the murdered man formed a bird called Sady or H\u00e1mah (not the Hum\u00e1 or Hum\u00e1i, usually translated \"phnix\") which sprang from the head, where four of the five senses have their seat, and haunted his tomb, crying continually, \"Usk\u00fani!\"=Give me drink (of the slayer's blood) ! and which disappeared only when the vendetta was accomplished. Mohammed forbade the belief. Amongst the Southern Slavs the cuckoo is supposed to be the sister of a murdered man ever calling or vengeance.\n\n[FN#329] To obtain a blessing and show how he valued it.\n\n[FN#330] Well-known tribes of proto-historic Arabs who flourished before the time of Abraham: see Koran (chaps. xxvi. et passim). They will be repeatedly mentioned in The Nights and notes.\n\n[FN#331] Arab. \"Amt\u00e1r\"; plur. of \"Matr,\" a large vessel of leather or wood for water, etc.\n\n[FN#332] Arab. \"As\u00e1f\u00edr\u00ed,\" so called because they attract sparrows (as\u00e1f\u00edr) a bird very fond of the ripe oily fruit. In the Romance of \"Antar\" As\u00e1f\u00edr camels are beasts that fly like birds in fleetness. The reader must not confound the olives of the text with the hard unripe berries (\"little plums pickled in stale\") which appear at English tables, nor wonder that bread and olives are the beef-steak and potatoes of many Mediterranean peoples It is an excellent diet, the highly oleaginous fruit supplying the necessary carbon,\n\n[FN#333] Arab. \"Tamer al-Hindi\"=the \"Indian-date,\" whence our word \"Tamarind.\" A sherbet of the pods, being slightly laxative, is much drunk during the great heats; and the dried fruit, made into small round cakes, is sold in the bazars. The traveller is advised not to sleep under the tamarind's shade, which is infamous for causing ague and fever. In Sind I derided the \"native nonsense,\" passed the night under an \"Indian date-tree\" and awoke with a fine specimen of ague which lasted me a week.\n\n[FN#334] Moslems are not agreed upon the length of the Day of Doom when all created things, marshalled by the angels, await final judgment; the different periods named are 40 years, 70, 300 and 50,000. Yet the trial itself will last no longer than while one may milk an ewe, or than \"the space between two milkings of a she-camel.\" This is bringing down Heaven to Earth with a witness; but, after all, the Heaven of all faiths, including \"Spiritualism,\" the latest development, is only an earth more or less glorified even as the Deity is humanity more or less perfected.\n\n[FN#335] Arab. \"Al-Kamar\u00e1ni,\" lit. \"the two moons.\" Arab rhetoric prefers it to \"Shams\u00e1ni,\" or {`two suns,\" because lighter (akhaff), to pronounce. So, albeit Omar was less worthy than Abu-Bakr the two are called \"Al-Omar\u00e1ni,\" in vulgar parlance, Omarayn.\n\n[FN#336] Alluding to the angels who appeared to the Sodomites in the shape of beautiful youths (Koran xi.).\n\n[FN#337] Koran xxxiii. 38.\n\n[FN#338] \"Niktu-hu taklidan\" i.e. not the real thing (with a woman). It may also mean \"by his incitement of me.\" All this scene is written in the worst form of Persian-Egyptian blackguardism, and forms a curious anthropological study. The \"black joke\" of the true and modest wife is inimitable.\n\n[FN#339] Arab. \"Jam\u00edz\" (in Egypt \"Jammayz\") = the fruit of the true sycomore (F. Sycomorus) a magnificent tree which produces a small tasteless fig, eaten by the poorer classes in Egypt and by monkeys. The \"T\u00edn\" or real fig here is the woman's parts; the \"mulberry- fig,\" the anus. Martial (i. 65) makes the following distinction:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Dicemus ficus, quas scimus in arbore nasci,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Dicemus ficos, Caeciliane, tuos.\n\nAnd Modern Italian preserves a difference between fico and fica.\n\n[FN#340] Arab. \"Gh\u00e1niyat Az\u00e1r\u00e1\" (plur. of Azr\u00e1 = virgin): the former is properly a woman who despises ornaments and relies on \"beauty unadorned\" (i.e. in bed).\n\n[FN#341] \"Nihil usitatius apud monachos, cardinales, sacrificulos,\" says Johannes de la Casa Beneventius Episcopus, quoted by Burton Anat. of Mel. lib. iii. Sect. 2; and the famous epitaph on the Jesuit,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Ci-git un Jesuite:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Passant, serre les fesses et passe vite!\n\n[FN#342] Arab. \"Kiblah\"=the fronting-place of prayer, Meccah for Moslems, Jerusalem for Jews and early Christians. See Pilgrimage (ii. 321) for the Moslem change from Jerusalem to Meccah and ibid. (ii. 213) for the way in which the direction was shown.\n\n[FN#343] The Koran says (chaps. ii.): \"Your wives are your tillage: go in therefore unto your tillage in what manner so ever ye will.\" Usually this is understood as meaning in any posture, standing or sitting, lying, backwards or forwards. Yet there is a popular saying about the man whom the woman rides (vulg. St. George, in France, le Postillon); \"Cursed be who maketh woman Heaven and himself earth!\" Some hold the Koranic passage to have been revealed in confutation of the Jews, who pretended that if a man lay with his wife backwards, he would beget a cleverer child. Others again understand it of preposterous venery, which is absurd: every ancient law-giver framed his code to increase the true wealth of the people\u2014population\u2014and severely punished all processes, like onanism, which impeded it. The Persians utilise the hatred of women for such misuse when they would force a wive to demand a divorce and thus forfeit her claim to Mahr (dowry); they convert them into catamites till, after a month or so, they lose all patience and leave the house.\n\n[FN#344] Koran lit 9: \"He will be turned aside from the Faith (or Truth) who shall be turned aside by the Divine decree;\" alluding, in the text, to the preposterous venery her lover demands.\n[FN#345] Arab. \"Fut\u00fah\" meaning openings, and also victories, benefits. The lover congratulates her on her mortifying self in order to please him.\n\n[FN#346] \"And the righteous work will be exalt\": (Koran xxxv. 11) applied ironically.\n\n[FN#347] A prolepsis of Tommy Moore:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         Your mother says, my little Venus,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         There's something not quite right between us,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0               And you're in fault as much as I,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Now, on my soul, my little Venus,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          I swear 'twould not be right between us,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0               To let your mother tell a lie.\n\nBut the Arab is more moral than Mr. Little. as he purposes to repent.\n\n[FN#348] Arab. \"Khunsa\" flexible or flaccid, from Khans=bending inwards, i.e. the mouth of a water-skin before drinking. Like Mukhannas, it is also used for an effeminate man, a passive sodomite and even for a eunuch. Easterns still believe in what Westerns know to be an impossibility, human beings with the parts and proportions of both sexes equally developed and capable of reproduction; and Al-Islam even provides special rules for them (Pilgrimage iii. 237). We hold them to be Buffon's fourth class of (duplicate) monsters belonging essentially to one or the other sex, and related to its opposite only by some few characteristics. The old Greeks dreamed, after their fashion, a beautiful poetic dream of a human animal uniting the contradictory beauties of man and woman. The duality of the generative organs seems an old Egyptian tradition, at least we find it in Genesis (i. 27) where the image of the Deity is created male and female, before man was formed out of the dust of the ground (ii. 7). The old tradition found its way to India (if the Hindus did not borrow the idea from the Greeks); and one of the forms of Mahadeva, the third person of their triad, is entitled \"Ardhan\u00e1r\u00ed\"=the Half-woman, which has suggested to them some charming pictures. Europeans, seeing the left breast conspicuously feminine, have indulged in silly surmises about the \"Amazons.\"\n\n[FN#349] This is a mere phrase for our \"dying of laughter\": the queen was on her back. And as Easterns sit on carpets, their falling back is very different from the same movement off a chair.\n\n[FN#350] Arab. \"Ismid,\" the eye-powder before noticed.\n\n[FN#351] When the Caliph (e.g. Al-T\u00e1'i li'llah) bound a banner to a spear and handed it to an officer, he thereby appointed him Sultan or Viceregent.\n\n[FN#352] Arab. \"Sh\u00e1ib al-ingh\u00e1z\"=lit. a gray beard who shakes head in disapproval.\n\n[FN#353] Arab. \"Ay\u00e1t\" = the Hebr. \"Ototh,\" signs, wonders or\nKoranic verses.\n\n[FN#354] The Chapter \"Al-Ikhl\u00e1s\" i.e. clearing (oneself from any faith but that of Unity) is No. cxii. and runs thus:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Say, He is the One God!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                The sempiternal God,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0           He begetteth not, nor is He begot,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0              And unto Him the like is not.\n\nIt is held to be equal in value to one-third of the Koran, and is daily used in prayer. Mr. Rodwell makes it the tenth.\n\n[FN#355] The Lady Budur shows her noble blood by not objecting to her friend becoming her Zarrat (sister-wife). This word is popularly derived from \"Zarar\"=injury; and is vulgarly pronounced in Egypt \"Durrah\" sounding like Durrah = a parrot (see Burckhardt's mistake in Prov. 314). The native proverb says, \"Ayshat al-durrah murrah,\" the sister-wife hath a bitter life. We have no English equivalent; so I translate indifferently co-wife, co-consort, sister-wife or sister in wedlock.\n\n[FN#356] Lane preserves the article \"El-Amjad\" and \"El-As'ad;\" which is as necessary as to say \"the John\" or \"the James,\" because neo-Latins have \"il Giovanni\" or \"il Giacomo.\" In this matter of the article, however, it is impossible to lay down a universal rule: in some cases it must be preserved and only practice in the language can teach its use. For instance, it is always present in Al-Bahrayn and al-Yaman; but not necessarily so with Irak and Najd.\n\n[FN#357] It is hard to say why this ugly episode was introduced.\nIt is a mere false note in a tune pretty enough.\n\n[FN#358] The significance of this action will presently appear.\n\n[FN#359] An \"Had\u00eds.\"\n\n[FN#360] Arab. \"Sabb\" = using the lowest language of abuse. chiefly concerning women-relatives and their reproductive parts.\n\n[FN#361] The reader will note in the narration concerning the two Queens the parallelism of the Arab's style which recalls that of the Hebrew poets. Strings of black silk are plaited into the long locks (an \"idiot-fringe\" being worn over the brow) because a woman is cursed \"who joineth her own hair to the hair of another\" (especially human hair). Sending the bands is a sign of affectionate submission; and, in extremes\" cases the hair itself is sent.\n\n[FN#362] i.e., suffer similar pain at the spectacle, a phrase often occurring.\n\n[FN#363] i.e., when the eye sees not, the heart grieves not.\n\n[FN#364] i.e., unto Him we shall return, a sentence recurring in almost every longer chapter of the Koran.\n\n[FN#365] Arab. \"Kun,\" the creative Word (which, by the by, proves the Koran to be an uncreated Logos); the full sentence being \"Kun fa k\u00e1na\" = Be! and it became. The origin is evidently, \"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light\" (Gen. i. 3); a line grand in its simplicity and evidently borrowed from the Egyptians, even as Yahveh (Jehovah) from \"Ankh\"=He who lives (Brugsch Hist. ii. 34).\n\n[FN#366] i.e. but also for the life and the so-called \"soul.\"\n\n[FN#367] Arab. \"Lay\u00e1li\"=lit. nights which, I have said, is often applied to the whole twenty-four hours. Here it is used in the sense of \"fortune\" or \"fate ;\" like \"days\" and \"days and nights.\"\n\n[FN#368] Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr a nephew of Ayishah, who had rebuilt the Ka'abah in A.H. 64 (A.D. 683), revolted (A.D. 680) against Yezid and was proclaimed Caliph at Meccah. He was afterwards killed (A.D. 692) by the famous or infamous Hajj\u00e1j general of Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, the fifth Ommiade, surnamed \"Sweat of a stone\" (skin-flint) and \"Father of Flies,\" from his foul breath. See my Pilgrimage, etc. (iii. 192-194), where are explained the allusions to the Ka'abah and the holy Black Stone.\n\n[FN#369] These lines are part of an elegy on the downfall of one of the Moslem dynasties in Spain, composed in the twelfth century by Ibn Abdun al-Andal\u00fasi. The allusion is to the famous conspiracy of the Kh\u00e1rijites (the first sectarians in Mohammedanism) to kill Ah, Mu'awiyah and Amru (so written but pronounced \"Amr\") al-As, in order to abate intestine feuds m Al-Islam. Ali was slain with a sword-cut by Ibn Muljam a name ever damnable amongst the Persians; Mu'awiyah escaped with a wound and Kharijah, the Chief of Police at Fustat or old Cairo was murdered by mistake for Amru. After this the sectarian wars began.\n\n[FN#370] Arab. \"Sar\u00e1b\"= (Koran, chaps. xxiv.) the reek of the Desert, before explained. It is called \"Lama,\" the shine, the loom, in Al-Hariri. The world is compared with the mirage, the painted eye and the sword that breaks in the sworder's hand.\n\n[FN#371] Arab. \"Duny\u00e1,\" with the common alliteration \"d\u00e1niyah\" (=Pers. \"d\u00fan\"), in prose as well as poetry means the things or fortune of this life opp. to \"Akhirah\"=future life.\n\n[FN#372] Arab. \"Walgh,\" a strong expression primarily denoting the lapping of dogs; here and elsewhere \"to swill, saufen.\"\n\n[FN#373] The lines are repeated from Night ccxxi. I give Lane's version (ii. 162) by way of contrast and\u2014warning.\n\n[FN#374] \"S\u00e1hirah\" is the place where human souls will be gathered on Doom-day: some understand by it the Hell Sa'\u00edr (No. iv.) intended for the Sabians or the Devils generally.\n\n[FN#375] His eyes are faded like Jacob's which, after weeping for Joseph, \"became white with mourning\" (Koran, chaps. xxi.). It is a stock comparison.\n\n[FN#376] The grave.\n\n[FN#377] Arab. \"Saww\u00e1n\" (popularly pronounced Suw\u00e1n) =\"Syenite\" from Syrene; generally applied to silex, granite or any hard stone.\n\n[FN#378] A proceeding fit only for thieves and paupers: \"Alpinism\" was then unknown. \"You come from the mountain\" (al-Jabal) means, \"You are a clod-hopper\"; and \"I will sit upon the mountain\"=turn anchorite or magician. (Pilgrimage i. 106.)\n\n[FN#379] Corresponding with wayside chapels in Catholic countries. The Moslem form would be either a wall with a prayer niche (Mibr\u00e1b) fronting Meccah-wards or a small domed room. These little oratories are often found near fountains, streams or tree-clumps where travellers would be likely to alight. I have described one in Sind (\"Scinde or the Unhappy Valley\" i. 79), and have noted that scrawling on the walls is even more common in the East than in the West; witness the monuments of old Egypt bescribbled by the Greeks and Romans. Even the paws of the Sphinx are covered with such graffiti; and those of Ipsambul or Abu S\u00edmbal have proved treasures to epigraphists.\n\n[FN#380] In tales this characterises a Persian; and Hero Rustam is always so pictured.\n\n[FN#381] The Parsis, who are the representatives of the old Guebres, turn towards the sun and the fire as their Kiblah or point of prayer; all deny that they worship it. But, as in the case of saints' images, while the educated would pray before them for edification (Labia) the ignorant would adore them (Dulia); and would make scanty difference between the \"reverence of a servant\" and the \"reverence of a slave.\" The human sacrifice was quite contrary to Guebre, although not to Hindu, custom; although hate and vengeance might prompt an occasional murder.\n\n[FN#382] These oubliettes are common in old eastern houses as in the medieval Castles of Europe, and many a stranger has met his death in them. They are often so well concealed that even the modern inmates are not aware of their existence.\n\n[FN#383] Arab. \"Bakk\"; hence our \"bug\" whose derivation (like that of \"cat\" \"dog\" and \"hog\") is apparently unknown to the dictionaries, always excepting M. Littr\u00e9's.\n\n[FN#384] i.e. thy beauty is ever increasing.\n\n[FN#385] Alluding, as usual, to the eye-lashes, e.g.\nAn eyelash arrow from an eyebrow bow.\n\n[FN#386] Lane (ii. 168) reads:\u2014\"The niggardly female is protected by her niggardness;\" a change of \"Nah\u00edlah\" (bee-hive) into \"Bakh\u00edlah\" (she skin flint).\n\n[FN#387] Koran iv. 38. The advantages are bodily strength, understanding and the high privilege of Holy War. Thus far, and thus far only, woman amongst Moslems is \"lesser\n\n[FN#388] Arab. \"Amir Y\u00e1kh\u00far,\" a corruption of \"Akhor\"=stable\n(Persian).\n\n[FN#389] A servile name in Persian, meaning \"the brave,\" and a title of honour at the Court of Delhi when following the name. Many English officers have made themselves ridiculous (myself amongst the number) by having it engraved on their seal-rings, e.g. Brown S\u00e1hib Bah\u00e1dur. To write the word \"Behadir\" or \"Bah\u00e1dir\" is to adopt the wretched Turkish corruption.\n\n[FN#390] \"Jerry Sneak\" would be the English reader's comment; but in the East all charges are laid upon women.\n\n[FN#391] Here the formula means \"I am sorry for it, but I couldn't help it.\"\n\n[FN#392] A noble name of the Persian Kings (meaning the planet\nMars) corrupted in Europe to Varanes.\n\n[FN#393] Arab. \"Jall\u00e1b,\" one of the three muharram\u00e1t or forbiddens, the H\u00e1rik al-hajar (burner of stone) the K\u00e1ti' al-shajar (cutter of trees, without reference to Hawarden N. B.) and the B\u00e1yi' al-bashar (seller of men, vulg. Jall\u00e1b). The two former worked, like the Italian Carbonari, in desert places where they had especial opportunities for crime. (Pilgrimage iii. 140.) None of these things must be practiced during Pilgrimage on the holy soil of Al-Hijaz\u2014not including Jeddah.\n\n[FN#394] The verses contain the tenets of the Murjiy sect which attaches infinite importance to faith and little or none to works. Sale (sect. viii.) derives his \"Morgians\" from the \"Jabrians\" (Jabari), who are the direct opponents of the \"Kadarians\" (Kadari), denying free will and free agency to man and ascribing his actions wholly to Allah. Lane (ii. 243) gives the orthodox answer to the heretical question:\u2014\n\nWater could wet him not if God please guard His own; *\nNor need man care though bound of hands in sea he's thrown:\nBut if His Lord decree that he in sea be drowned; *\nHe'll drown albeit in the wild and wold he wone.\n\nIt is the old quarrel between Predestination and Freewill which cannot be solved except by assuming a Law without a Lawgiver.\n\n[FN#395] Our proverb says: Give a man luck and throw him into the sea.\n\n[FN#396] As a rule Easterns, I repeat, cover head and face when sleeping especially in the open air and moonlight. Europeans find the practice difficult, and can learn it only by long habit.\n\n[FN#397] Pers. = a flower-garden. In Galland, Bahram has two daughters, Bostama and Cavam a. In the Bres. Edit. the daughter is \"Bostan\" and the slave-girl \"Kaw\u00e1m.\"\n\n[FN#398] Arab. \"Kah\u00edl\"=eyes which look as if darkened with antimony: hence the name of the noble Arab breed of horses \"Kuhaylat\" (Al-Ajuz, etc.).\n\n[FN#399] \"As'ad\"=more (or most) fortunate.\n\n[FN#400] This is the vulgar belief, although Mohammed expressly disclaimed the power in the Koran (chaps. xiii. 8), \"Thou art commissioned to be a preacher only and not a worker of miracles.\" \"Signs\" (Arab. Ay\u00e1t) may here also mean verses of the Koran, which the Apostle of Allah held to be his standing miracles. He despised the common miracula which in the East are of everyday occurrence and are held to be easy for any holy man. Hume does not believe in miracles because he never saw one. Had he travelled in the East he would have seen (and heard of) so many that his scepticism (more likely that testimony should be false than miracles be true) would have been based on a firmer foundation. It is one of the marvels of our age that whilst two-thirds of Christendom (the Catholics and the \"Orthodox\" Greeks) believe in \"miracles\" occurring not only in ancient but even in our present days, the influential and intelligent third (Protestant) absolutely \"denies the fact.\"\n\n[FN#401] Arab. \"Al-Shah\u00e1dat\u00e1ni\";

It looks peaceful and quiet. The title flashes on the screen:\nEd Edd n Eddy's BIG PICTURE SHOW\nA backyard is shown. There is a kiddie pool set up with a toy boat gently rocking in it. Behind the pool is a clothesline, strung with clothes.\n\nWriters:\nJono Howard\nMike Kubat\nRachel Connor\nStacy Warnick\nDanny Antonucci\nA sprinkler is watering Kevin's lawn. Kevin's bike is leaned against the garage. A close-up is shown of the sprinkler moving back and forth before looking at another house across the street.\n\nStoryboard:\nScott Underwood\nSteve Garcia\nRaven Molisee\nJoel Dickie\nBig Jim Miller\nRolf's tractor is sitting abandoned in a field of weeds. Rolf seems to have been mowing the lawn before suddenly stopping for some unknown reason. The wind blows, and some dandelion seeds come loose and float to another lawn, where a checkers game seems to have been in progress. A half-finished bottle of soda and a can of wood varnish occupy each end of the board.\n\nComposer:\nPatric Caird\nAn abandoned basketball is seen next to a game of hopscotch. Strangely, the number on the end is 62, and the square is incomplete. Following said trail, we find some broken chalk, two abandoned shoes, a skateboard with the wheels still rolling, and a dropped ice-cream cone on which ants are crawling. Lightning flashes, and we see the lane, utterly destroyed. A silhouette of Nazz can be seen splattered against one fence along with various debris, including a bag of cement, spilled black paint, an oven mitt, a toaster, and a cinder block with a balloon tied to it. The camera moves back to the ants, crawling on the ice cream, before the lightning crashes again and we see more of the lane, replete with footprints, downed trees, and boxes. Among the destroyed items are a record and a bowling ball. We then see the ants again before getting a long shot of the destroyed area. In addition to the lane, a house has suffered remarkable damage, and there is even an ice cream truck in its backyard. Not only this, but a water main has broken, flooding an area near the woods, and there is strangely enough a broken canoe by another house.\n\nDirected by\nDanny AntonucciEd bursts into his room, knocking the door off its hinges and into the back wall. He spots it and tries to run through it but instead runs into the bricks that make up his basement. Stumbling backwards, he spots his shoe and rips it off before trying to get his sock off with his teeth. As he works to get it loose, he hops around his room, destroying it. Finally getting his sock off, Ed grabs two comics and Baron O' Beefdip.\nEd: \"Trouble! Bad!\" [He grabs a stack of random junk.] \"Pain!\"\nEd puts some bread in a toaster and sets it to go off before grabbing a bag and stuffing it full. Spotting his chair, Ed shakes the assorted items and the stuffing out of it into the bag and shoves the chair into the bag. He then rushes into the bathroom and tears down the drywall to reveal his sponge collection. The toast pops up, and Ed quickly grabs the hot bread, butters it, and tosses it into his bag. He pulls the bag out of the wall and grabs his sponges before running off.Sarah cuts a hole in a cardboard box and looks through it.\nSarah: \"Okay, Jimmy. Ready?\" [She turns the camera to Jimmy, who is dressed like a pirate.] \"Aaaand...action!\"]\n\nJimmy: \"Okay. Arr! Avast thee, barnacle-ridden bully! For I, the great pirate, Keelhaul Crewstain, will swash your buckle, and yardarm your sealeg!\" [Sarah, the cameraman and director, looks up unhappily.]\nSarah: \"Cut, cut, cut cut!\" [through a megaphone] \"What the heck was that? C'mon, say it like you mean it! You're a bloodthirsty scourge of the seven seas, silly!\" [Jimmy thinks, trying to find his inner pirate.]\nJimmy: \"I found it, Sarah!\"\n\nSarah: \"Aaaand...action!\"\nA huge explosion rocks the set. Ed has just burst out of the house. Spotting Sarah and Jimmy, he jumps up and grabs his sponges.]\nEd: \"Save yourselves!\" [He hugs the sponges.] \"Be free, dear friends!\" [Ed casts the sponges skyward, grabs his bag, and runs off.] \"Trouble! Bad! Pain!\"\nSarah and Jimmy look at each other, confused by Ed's behavior.Edd is in his room, whimpering. A bunch of clothes are on his bed, next to an empty suitcase. He is trying to write a goodbye note.\nEdd: \"Beloved parents. By the time you read this, I will be long\u2013far\u2013oh dear.\" [He picks up the note, folds it, and puts it in the trash along with many other failed attempts before starting again.] \"Dearest Mother and Father. It is with great sh-shame...\" [Edd puts down his pen and begins to cry. Pulling himself together] \"That I regretfully con-fess...to...\" [a few tears leak out] \"I regretfully confess to my involvement in the inexcusable, unconscionable, reprehensible, abhorrent, detrimental, detestable, incomprehensible, immoral, thoughtless, impossible, hurtful\u2013\" [Edd's writing goes jagged, and he stops and wails.] \"Oh, what have we done! GGGGAAAAAAAHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!\"\nEdd gives in to his tears. Suddenly, his door bursts open. Edd looks behind him and sees a worried Ed.\nEd: \"Dah-houble D!\"Eddy is shoving things into his suitcase. He finishes and tries to slam the overstuffed case shut. When he finally does so, he tries to lift it, but finds it too heavy. Suddenly, it bursts open, scattering its contents all over the room. Eddy lies there. He gets up just as a banging comes at the door. Eddy leaps up, terrified. He grabs the vacuum cleaner and affects a falsetto.\nEddy: [imitating his mother] \"Um, my little Eddy's not home right now!\"\nThe door flies open.\nEddy: \"DON'T HURT ME!\" [He dives behind the vacuum cleaner.]\nEd: [running in] \"Trouble! Bad!\"\nEd trips over the vacuum and lands on Eddy.\nEddy: \"It wasn't my fault, I swear!\" [He realizes who it is.] \"Ed, you idiot!\" [packing again] \"I thought it was those sore losers!\"\n\nEd: [panicking] \"What do we do, Eddy? What do we do?\"\nEddy: \"What happened to Sockhead?\"\nEd reaches into his bag and pulls out Edd.\nEddy: \"Here, hold this!\" [He hands the suitcase to Edd.]\nEdd: \"We're fugitives, Eddy! Are you aware of the consequences we're about to endure? All because of our misguided chicanery!\"\nThe Eds see a shadow pass by the blinds.\nEddy: \"Too late! Quick, my brother's room!\"\nThe Eds rush out of Eddy's room and head down the hall. They come to the front door and skid to a halt; something outside is hammering on it, trying to get in. Eddy quickly directs them upstairs. The door bursts open behind them, but the Eds continue running. They find the room, and Eddy begins to open the door.The door creaks open, and Eddy peeks in. He looks around. Seeing nobody, he enters.\nEdd: [following him in] \"Eddy, do you think this is wise?\"\n\nEddy: \"They'll never find us in here!\" [He rummages through the closet.] \"Ah-ha!\" [He tapes the wallpaper to the door.] \"Ssh!\" [Eddy closes the door.The lights click on in the room. Eddy proceeds to do all the locks. The Eds huddle together in the center of the room, waiting for the coming storm and hoping it will pass them by.\nEddy: [whispering] \"This is all your fault, Sockhead!\"\n\nEdd: [whispering, shocked] \"My fault? Funny, isn't it, how it's always my fault when yet another of your amazing scams goes awry!\"\n\nEddy: [whispering] \"Yeah, well, I didn't see you stop me! You shoulda known it would go bad!\"\n\nEd: \"Boy, did it go bad.\"\nThey stop talking. There's a creaking and some noises outside. Eddy looks up and spots a congratulatory glass on top of the fridge. He pushes Edd to the door, and a piece of toast falls off Edd's back. Eddy then hands Edd the glass and gestures for him to use it to listen. Edd puts the glass to the door and his ear to the glass while Eddy stashes himself in Ed's pocket. All three Eds are sweating as they listen for any noise. Suddenly, a crunch comes, and Edd's eyes turn inwards. Eddy looks up and sees Ed eating the toast. Edd, now standing in a puddle of his own sweat, drops the glass. The door starts to buckle as something pounds on it.\nEd: \"We are not long for this world!\"\nEd darts around the room, trying to find shelter.\nEdd: \"The window!\"\nEdd rushes over and parts the curtains only to find that it's been bricked up.\nEddy: \"What's with my brother and these stupid bricks?!?\"\nEdd and Eddy stumble backwards and trip over the rug. It rolls up, revealing a vent.\nEdd: \"Eddy, look! This heat vent will lead to an escape!\"\n\nEd: [on the camel] \"Over here, guys! My lumpy mutated horsie will save us!\"\nThe wooden bar breaks, and a foot kicks through the doorknob.\nEdd: \"Eddy! The door won't hold for much longer!\"\n\nEddy: [panicked] \"Don't just stand there! Do something!\"\nEdd grabs onto Eddy and pulls, trying to work the grate loose. He looks over to Ed, who is trying to get the camel to run.\nEd: \"Giddy-up, horsie! Do not let your mutated lump slow you down!\"\nEd falls off the camel and slams into the wall. He hits what looks like a fire alarm and slides down. Edd and Eddy, meanwhile, finally get the vent cover loose, and Eddy leaps in only to find that his brother bricked up the vents as well.\nEddy: \"More bricks Double D!\"\n\nEd: \"Ooh ooh oh! This-a-way, guys!\" [He shows them the alarm.] \"Look!\"\n\nEdd: [reading] \"In case of movie break glass?\"\n\nEddy: \"Bingo!\" [He grabs the provided hammer and breaks the case.] \"My bro's always prepared!\" [He reaches inside and pulls out a peanut.] \"A peanut?\"\n\nEd: \"Cheap movie.\"\nAn arm reaches through the space where the doorknob used to be. It feels the chains before reaching down and lifting one of the bolts. The door creaks open a little more, and we see the kids, straining to get into the room.\nKevin: \"Lemme through! End of the line, dorks!\" [Ed grabs the peanut with his teeth.]\nEddy: \"It was just a scam, Double D! How did it go so wrong?\"\n\nEdd: [scared] \"Eddy, the laws of probability can be a real mean\u2013\"\n\nEd: [garbled] \"Just my mouth!\"\nEd bites down on the nut, and the shell cracks, revealing a key.\nEdd: \"Eddy! A key!\"\nThe kids strain at the door.\nEddy: \"It must be for my brother's car!\"\nA piece of the door breaks loose. Eddy scrambles into the drivers seat.\nEdd: \"Eddy, we're too young to drive!\"\n\nEddy: \"Get in, get in!\"\nEd dives into the backseat while Edd rides shotgun. Eddy fumbles with the key.\nEddy: \"Come on!\"\nHe finally puts it in the ignition. He turns it, and the engine barely coughs. Eddy tries again, and the engine coughs again.\nEdd: \"It's no use, Eddy!\"\n\nEddy: [trying again] \"It ain't workin!\"\nThe chains break as Rolf slams his head through the door.\nRolf: \"Rolf's vengeance will be slow and painful, like Papa's charcoal anecdotes, Ed-boys!\"\nRolf crashes through the door, and Nazz, Kevin, Jonny, and Plank follow him in. Ed plunges his feet through the car's floor.\nEd: \"I am Ed! Cheese and macaroni!\"\nEd runs forward. The kids grab on to the car as it breaks through the doorway and smashes through the second floor, sailing outside. The impact with the wall shakes the kids off, and they fall on the grass outside Eddy's house.\nNazz: \"They're getting away, guys!\"\nThe car twists onto the road and slams into a hydrant before turning and running into a garage. It then backs up and goes through a fence. Rolf, meanwhile, lets out a piercing whistle, and his pig gallops up.\nRolf: \"Peel your onions Ed-boy!\" [sinister] \"And cry.\" [getting on Wilfred] \"There is no escaping the son of a shepherd!\" [He rides off in hot pursuit.\nKevin: \"Right behind you, man.\"\nKevin and Nazz take off after Rolf. Sarah and Jimmy peek out from behind a house.\nSarah: \"Let's go see, Jimmy!\"\nSarah and Jimmy race to the sidewalk just in time to see the car go by, followed immediately by Kevin, on his bike; Rolf, on his pig; and Nazz, running after them.\nSarah: [gleefully] \"Yowzers! Whaddya think they did this time, Jimmy?\"\n\nJimmy: \"Whatever it was, it must be worser than ever!\"The Eds trundle down the road.\nEdd: \"I think I'm gonna be sick!\"\n\nEddy: \"Not in my brother's car, you're not!\"\nPlank, ripped and torn and almost destroyed, tumbles onto the windshield.\nEdd and Eddy: \"WAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!\"\n\nEd: \"BBBWWWWWWAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!\"\nEd swerves, scared out of his mind. The car almost hits Jonny.\nJonny: [angry and scared] \"Let em have it buddy!\"Rolf and Kevin ride into a field. Kevin skids his bike to a stop. The car jumps, and lands on the fences bordering the lane. Rolf chases them. He gets close, and pulls on Wilfred's ears to coax out more speed. Wilfred speeds up, and they approach the car's rear. Eddy meanwhile looks out of the window. He looks down, and his eyes bulge. The wheels are just barely staying on the top of the fence. One false move, and they will fall to their quite probable deaths.\nEdd: [lamenting] \"So much undone! Unsaid! Mother and Father will be so annoyed!\"\n\nEd: \"Yowch!\"\nRolf has clamped down on Ed's leg with his teeth. The only thing propelling the car now is pure momentum.\nEd: \"They got me, guys!\" [He begins to slip out.] \"I'm a goner! Save yourselves!\" [Ed is close to being dragged out.] \"Don't forget about me!\" [Ed falls out of the car.] \"See ya.\"\n\nEdd and Eddy: \"Ed!\"\nEdd and Eddy each grab an arm and pull. They painstakingly yank Ed back into the still-moving car, although Rolf refuses to let go. Suddenly, Ed's leg slips out of Rolf's teeth, and the Eds slip back into the car. At this moment, they reach the end of the fence and fly out over a dumpster.\nRolf: \"Curse you Ed-boys!\"\nRolf slams into the dumpster. The car sails into the woods, hitting many trees along the way and snapping them. The Eds scream as they go through the woods and fly over a ravine into the junkyard. The wheels continue to carry them forward until Ed resumes his position as the motor and runs again. They pass by a mountain of trash.Kevin is on top of a mountain of junk with his bike. He sees the Eds pass and snarls.Nazz is skating down the lane. She finds the dumpster with Rolf's indentation and stops. Rolf is nowhere to be seen. Jonny then runs up carrying Plank. He is out-of-breath.Eddy peers over the steering wheel as they rush through the junkyard. Suddenly, Kevin slams their vehicle from the left, shaking them and sending them skidding.\nEd: \"Oh, help me!\"\n\nEdd: \"Oh dear, now what?!?\"\nEddy looks out the window and spots Kevin. Kevin then hits them again, and the car once again skids.\nEddy: \"He's a maniac, I tell ya!\"\nKevin slams them a third time, and this time they spin in circles. The car hits another mountain of trash, and this acts like a ramp. The car leaps into the air and slips upside down. As it does this, Edd turns green, and Eddy flies past him and out the window, still clinging to the wheel. The car lands on two wheels and continues to drive this way. Eddy is on the right side and is forced to run with the car. The car turns left, and Kevin follows. Rolf brings up the rear, having managed to rejoin the chase.\nRolf: \"Run like well-worn stockings, Wilfred!\"\nEd releases the car door briefly and grabs at the steering wheel. He spins it rapidly, pulling Eddy inside. Ed then grabs at the door and continues to run. They reach the edge of the junkyard and crash through the fence. The Eds reach Peach Creek Estates and blast through it, on the way wrecking some of the incomplete structures. Nazz and Jonny rejoin the chase.\nRolf: \"Prepare for Rolf's water-laden bovine bladder!\"\n\nJonny: \"Plank's freaking out!\"\n\nEddy: \"Double D! You got any bright ideas?\"\nEdd is puking into a paper bag.\nKevin: \"How do you like your faces? Fried or scrambled?\"\nThe Eds look up with a start. Kevin is on their left. Kevin then rips the door open.\nEddy: \"Ed! The door! The door, Lumpy!\"\n\nRolf: \"Rolf will assist you with the Ed-boy flogging Kevin!\" [He grabs Wilfred and they roll forward like a wheel.]\nNazz: \"Go Rolf go!\"\nEd manages to shut the door, tearing it away from Kevin. Eddy locks it and begins to roll up the window.\nEdd: \"Ed! Fingers!\"\nEd jerks his fingers back as the window closes. Kevin leaps onto the car, and his bike wheels off, coming to a stop against a sawhorse, perfectly parked. Rolf's wheel slams into the back of the car, and he and Wilfred fly upward. The pig lands on the roof, and Rolf lands on the hood. Nazz reaches their back and grabs onto the open trunk.\nKevin: [groping for them] \"You're going down, dudes.\"\nThe Eds look up and spot Wilfred's tail acting like a bottle opener on the roof. Rolf lifts the pig and tears the roof on, and the faces of the Eds' enemies leer in.\nKevin: \"Time for payback!\"\n\nJonny: \"Plank wants first crack at em!\"\n\nRolf: \"Rolf will use their hides as a crutch for Nana's goiter!\"\n\nNazz: \"Like, thanks for the help up here, guys? Duh!\"\n\nEd: \"It wasn't me! Eddy did it.\" [He ducks into his jacket.]\nEddy: \"In your dreams! It was Double D.\"\nEddy ducks into Ed's sleeve. Edd is about to say something when he sees that they are approaching the playground.\nEdd: \"Um, excuse me. I'll be right back.\"\nEdd leans out the window and grabs onto the merry-go-round. Centrifugal force is quick to act on the car, as the kids are pushed away from it. Wilfred is the first to fly off.\nJonny: \"Hang on buddddyyyy!\"\nThe roof tears off, and Rolf, Nazz, Jonny, and Plank fly away.\nKevin: \"You dorks ain't seen the last of me!!!\"\nKevin is torn off by the pressure, and he flies off and slams into the slide. At this point, the pressure on Edd is too great, and he lets go of the merry-go-round as well. The car flies into the air and over the wood. Kevin runs after them, carrying a metal pipe.\nKevin: \"DOOOOORRRRRKKKKKKKSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" [He throws the pipe away.]As Kevin screams at the sky, the camera moves back to the park.\nNazz: \"Kevin!\"\nJonny is stuck in a hole in the road.\nNazz: \"Kevin! Where are you!\"\nJonny escapes the hole.\nKevin: [ranting] \"I can't believe it! I almost had em! We can't let this go, man. Not after what they did!\"\nSarah and Jimmy tiptoe up to watch the show.\nNazz: \"What do we do now? Wait for them to come back?\" [Kevin helps her up, and she begins to cry.] \"'Cause I got like a million things to do! Hair extensions, exfoliating scrubs, spray tan, fingernails glued and polished, a pustule of\u2013\"\n\nRolf: \"Shed tears no more, fussbucket Nazz-girl. Rolf will unearth the Ed-boys and squash them like the parasite that infests Wilfred's tuchis! This is Rolf's word! Dawg?\"\n\nNazz: \"They're gonna wish they never messed with Nazz Van Bartonschmeer!\"\n\nJonny: \"I ain't goin near that one with a ten-foot pole, buddy.\"\n\nPlank:\nJonny: \"Say what?\"\n\nPlank:\nJonny: [whispering] \"You're reading my mind, Plank! It's time to call in the special forces.\"\n\nKevin: \"Those thieves couldn'tve got far. I'm getting my bike!\" [He walks off.]\nRolf: \"Yes! Rolf will draw forth the\u2013\"\n\nNazz: \"Wait up Kev!\" [She hurries after him.]\nRolf: \"Rolf will draw forth the pitchfork of retribution!\" [Jonny sneaks away.] \"The Ed-boys shall riddle Rolf's rind no more! Wilfred! To the shed!\"\nWilfred pops out of the ground and heads towards Rolf, squealing. Sarah and Jimmy watch.\nSarah: \"Pigs are so gross.\"\n\nJimmy: \"Golly gosh, Sarah, they're gonna hunt down the Eds! What on earth did they do?\"\n\nSarah: \"I don't know, Jimmy.\"\n\nJimmy: \"Think of what they'll do to them, Sarah! It'll be worse than soap in your eye! Worser than polyester chafing!\"\n\nSarah: \"Let's have a picnic and watch!\"\n\nJimmy: [after a pause] \"Oh yay, Sarah! I wouldn't miss this Ed-thrashing for all the shoulder pads in the world!\"\nThe two giggle and walk off.The car crashes down in the middle of a desert. Eddy sits up and adjusts the rearview mirror while Edd heaves himself up. Eddy then looks back as Ed continues to carry the car. Seeing no one, he smiles.\nEddy: \"Ha! We lost em!\"\n\nEdd: \"How can you be so certain, Eddy?\"\n\nEddy: \"Those chumps'll never catch us now! From here on out, it's nothing but smooth sailing!\"\nThe car slams into a giant rock. The rock tips over, and the car explodes. Ed wiggles his way out of an exhaust pipe and sees Eddy's three hairs sticking up from inside a car door. Ed rolls the window up, and Eddy pops out. Eddy looks around.\nEddy: [to Ed] \"Way to go, lummox! The only rock for miles, and you had to hit it!\"\nEdd is still in his seat, there only because of his seat belt.\nEdd: \"Seat belts certainly are a trusted friend.\" [His belt gives way, and he plunges to the ground.] \"Aah!\" [His friends stare at him. Suddenly, Edd jumps up.] \"I've followed all the rules! Lived a life of decency and principle! So why didn't I follow my instincts? That one day these short-sighted sophomoric shell games would go too far!!!\"\n\nEd: [diving behind Eddy] \"Double D's dark side makes my armpits sweat, Eddy.\"\n\nEddy: \"What doesn't?\"\n\nEdd: \"Lost souls are we, gentlemen, doomed for eternity!\" [He collapses to the ground.]\nEddy: \"Lighten up, Sockhead. Hasn't Eddy always steered you right?\" [helping Edd up] \"Don't answer that.\"\n\nEd: \"Oh, oh! If I might partake in this chat? Could we not joineth the circus? Eddy could be the world's\u2013\"\n\nEddy: [being twisted into a strange shape by Ed] \"Hey ow stop! It doesn't go that way!\"\n\nEd: \"\u2013shortest elephant!\" [He displays Eddy for all to see.] \"And you Double D can be the clown!\"\n\nEdd: [considering] \"I guess one could get used to the confining nature of tights.\"\n\nEddy: \"Talk about stupid.\" [He grabs his friends.] \"If we're goin anywhere, I know a place so out of the way, it's practically invisible.\"\n\nEdd: \"Dare I ask?\" [He clutches his forehead before turning back to Eddy, grinning.] \"And?\"\n\nEd: \"Yeah, Eddy. And?\"\n\nEddy: \"And...\" [clutching them close] \"If any of those losers find us there, they'll be mailed back to Peach Creek in a body cast.\"\n\nEd: \"Where we goin, Eddy?\"\nEddy walks a few feet away before leaping into the air to deliver his pronouncement.\nEddy: \"My big bro's place!\"\n\nEdd: [downhearted] \"Eddy, I have my doubts your brother would offer us sanctuary.\"\n\nEddy: \"What, are you kiddin me? We're kinda connected! Like twins! Brain wave stuff! He's talkin to me right now! C'mon!\"\n\nEd: \"Oh boy oh boy!\"\n\nEddy: \"He's waitin for us!\" [He runs off.]\nEd: \"Eddy's brother is so cool!\"\nEd runs off. Edd looks at them and then back at the wreckage of the car. Reaching into his hat, he pulls out his labeler and starts to make a label as he walks towards the trunk. He finishes up and places a label on the trunk reading \"Out of Order.\"\nEdd: \"There.\" [running after his friends] \"Wait for me, fellows!\"Rolf is looking through his shed.\nRolf: \"Downtrodden rabbit radishes! Where are the Duke of Deli Meats' hearty edibles?\"\nAs he looks for them, a long hedge rolls out. Jonny peeks out of it. Spying his incomplete checkers game, he runs and hides under the board and then crawls off, carrying it on his back. Jonny enters his backyard and pretends to nonchalantly swing. He slowly stops and looks from side to side. Spying nobody, he yanks on one of the ropes holding the swing up twice. The swing responds by ascending skyward, and another one descends, carrying a replica of Jonny and Plank. High in the tree, Jonny reaches up and finds a bird's nest. He fiddles around the eggs until he finds the one he wants. He then flips it open and presses a button. A secret door opens in front of him on the branch he is balanced on. He slips into it and enters an elevator. It drops six floors, and Jonny exits. He turns on a lamp and picks up a magnet. The magnet pulls the bear trap from his head. He then proceeds to descend down a bunch of stairs that look like melons. Jonny enters a giant, melon-themed chamber. He puts Plank on a melon-shaped chair and spins it before going to another one, sitting on it, and spinning it as well. The floor opens beneath the chairs and they drop.Outside the Melon Cave, a tree stump's top slides open and two heroes burst out.\nCaptain Melonhead: \"Shed a tear, 'cause Captain Melonhead and Splinter the Wonderwood are here!\"\nCaptain Melonhead leaps forward only to slam into a fence. His head gets stuck between two boards, but he manages to pull it out. Unfortunately, on the way out, his mask gets twisted, rendering him blind.\nCaptain Melonhead: \"Holy Toledo, Splinter! My Melon Vision! It's gone!\"\n\nSplinter the Wonderwood:\nCaptain Melonhead: \"Who's an idiot?\"\n\nSplinter the Wonderwood:\nCaptain Melonhead turns his mask and can once again see. He grabs his sidekick and takes off.\nCaptain Melonhead: \"It's Melon time! Hoop-ba-da, hee hee hee!\"Nazz and Kevin are tearing down the road, looking for the Eds. Kevin rides his bike past the school. He reaches a turnoff and takes it. Nazz is smiling until a bug hits her. This is followed in short order by several more. Bugs are hitting Kevin as well, but he doesn't seem to care.\nNazz: \"Major so gross, Kevin. These bugs are like freaking me out!\"\n\nKevin: \"Get a grip, Nazz! This rage train ain't stoppin till I thump those three twerps! Whoa.\"\nUp ahead is a gigantic cloud of flies. They hit it at full speed and go straight through it. When they come out, they are blanketed in dead flies.\nNazz: \"Kevin, stop!\" [Kevin blindly rubs at his eyes.] \"AAAAHHHH!!!\"\n\nKevin: \"AAAAAAHHH!\"\nThe three crash into a peach shed.\nNazz: [getting up] \"Ow! That hurt!\"\n\nKevin: \"Oh, man! I'm so sorry!\"\n\nNazz: \"Oh, I'm okay.\" [She holds her arms out for a hug.]\nKevin: \"It was totally my fault!\" [He runs past her.] \"This can't be happening. My bike's thrashed!\" [He heaves it upright and begins to work on it.\nNazz: \"Hello. Remember me?\"\n\nKevin: \"Nazz. We need to figure out where those foul-ups took off to and head em off. I'm pretty sure they won't be going back to the cul-de-sac. Not after what they did.\"\n\nNazz: \"That'd be the last thing they'd do. They're like such cowards.\"\n\nKevin: \"Good one, Nazz. Say, you got one of those hairpin things?\"\n\nNazz: \"Totally!\" [She hands one over, and Kevin rewires his bike.]\nKevin: \"Cowards run and hide, right? So who's the one person in the world that Eddy trusts, 'sides his two loser pals?\"\n\nNazz: \"What about his brother?\"\n\nKevin: \"That little twerp wouldn't have the\u2013\" [realizing something] \"That's it! They're going to Eddy's brother's place!\" [He grabs Nazz in a hug.] \"Nazz, you're awesome, babe.\"\nNazz smiles. Suddenly, Kevin throws her off.\nKevin: \"HOLD IT! Eddy's brother will murder us if he finds out we're after his little brother! We're wasting time! We gotta get those dorks before they get there. If they get there before we get there, they'll never get theirs.\"\n\nNazz: \"What?\"\n\nKevin: \"Forget it!\" [He pulls her onto the bike.] \"We gotta go.\"\nThe two set off again, this time on a much more damaged bike.A giant stack of items moves across the desert. On top is Rolf, directing it; on bottom, Wilfred, tugging it. Rolf is following a trail of footprints; one foot was in a shoe, while the other was bare. Suddenly, he spots a glint of metal up ahead, and he leaps off.\nRolf: \"We must not be seen, as the Ed-boys will surely flee, Wilfred! Lay low, and follow Rolf's posterior.\"\nThe two creep up on the rock. Suddenly, Rolf leaps out and brandishes his pitchfork.\nRolf: \"ED-BOYS! SHAKLAHAM! SHOOKEE! SHLOOHORM! DON'T EVER! DO THAT! AGAIN! SLAHEE FISHMONGER! Calle! Cai!\"\nRolf begins to pant. He then looks around and realizes that there's nobody there.\nRolf: \"The Ed-boys think they have played Rolf as a phony baloney. But they have yet to feel the wrath of this SON OF A SHEPHERD!\"\nRolf takes out a key and unlocks a suitcase. He takes another box out and opens it, revealing six eggs. He takes one out and looks around. Spotting the steaming engine, Rolf cracks the egg on it; the egg begins to fry. He then walks over to one of the seats and takes out a canteen. Rolf opens the canteen and pours oil out of it, onto the seat. Once the canteen is empty, he throws it and the cork over his shoulder. The cork lodges in Wilfred's nose, and the pig begins to snort.\nRolf: \"Wilfred! You interrupt Rolf's study! Do you think this is party time for 1999? No!\"\nRolf turns back to the chair. Taking out a muffin, he proceeds to dab it in the oil. He then looks at it.\nRolf: \"Ah ha.\"\nThe egg finishes cooking, and Rolf picks it up. He then proceeds to lay it on top of the muffin. Suddenly, Wilfred rams him from behind. Rolf drops the muffin, and Wilfred scrambles over and eats it.\nRolf: \"Wilfred! Has your thinkbox collapsed? Do not eat Rolf's tell-all! Back, I say!\"\nWilfred suddenly charges forward, pushing Rolf backwards.\nRolf: \"Wait\u2013Wilfred, no!\" [He slams into the car's trunk.] \"Accursed swine! Consider yourself stricken from the annual son-of-a-shepherd custard bake-off!\"\nHe notices the \"Out of Order\" label Edd stuck on the trunk. Peeling it off, he has Wilfred sniff it to get the scent.\nRolf: \"We'll have the Ed-boys on a spit by nightfall!\"The Eds are tromping through a grassy field.\nEd: \"Can your brother send me brain waves too, Eddy?\"\n\nEddy: \"If only you had a brain, Ed.\"\n\nEd: \"C'mon, Eddy, have a heart!\"\n\nEdd: \"Courage, courage Eddward.\"\nThey come to a gate marking off private property.\nEddy: \"Yee-haw!\"\nEddy kicks the gate open, and he and Ed enter. Edd hesitates.\nEdd: [gasping] \"Private property? Um, fellows!\"\nHe waits for his friends to come back. When they don't, he crosses the line.\nEdd: \"Wait! Stop!\" [He shuts the gate.] \"Come back! We're trespassing!\"\n\nEddy: \"Trespass, schmespass. It's a shortcut.\" [They enter a field of cows.]\nEd: \"Look, guys! Moo-moos there! Moo-moos everywhere!\"\n\nEddy: \"My bro's got a billion cows. A regular stampede of em.\"\nA crowd of flies settles above Ed's head. He approaches Eddy.\nEd: \"Your brother's got moo-moos, Eddy?\"\nEddy waves the flies away. Edd joins them.\nEdd: \"Haven't we poked and prodded fate enough for one day, Eddy?\" [whispering] \"I'm frightened.\"\n\nEddy: \"Poor little ol' Sockhead. You're so neeve.\"\n\nEdd: \"I think you mean naive, Eddy.\"\n\nEddy: \"That too. My big bro would never let anything happen to me, and I'll tell you what\u2013I'll put in a good word for you two.\"\n\nEdd: \"Thank you Eddy! Your brother certainly is a kind, upstanding and generous human being.\"\n\nEd: [joyful] \"He's got moo-moos, Double D!\"\n\nEdd: \"Yes, well...what's our estimated time of arrival to your brother's sanctuary, Eddy?\"\n\nEddy: \"Beats me. I don't know where he lives.\"\nEdd stops dead. Once he absorbs this, he runs to catch up to them.\nEdd: [astounded] \"Pardon? Are you saying all this time you've been leading us to nowhere?\"\n\nEddy: \"Nope. I'm taking you to my bro's house, smart guy. You just have to figure out where it is.\"\n\nEd: \"Oh, let me, Eddy! I have a good figure.\"\nEdd clutches his forehead. Ed dives into the grass and leaps out of it.\nEd: \"The hills are alive, Eddy!\"\n\nEddy: \"Yeah, with the sounds of an idiot.\"\n\nEdd: [stepping in front of them] \"Hold it right there! We're not taking one more step until we deduce the whereabouts of your brother, Eddy!\"\n\nEddy: [smug] \"Forget to pay the brain bill?\"\n\nEdd: \"But Eddy, your brother's always been somewhat of an enigma! I've got nothing to go on!\" [Eddy walks past.]\nEddy: \"Better hurry up, big bro's a-waitin.\"\n\nEd: [grabbing Eddy] \"Oh oh Eddy! Do you think I could get your brother's autograph?\"\n\nEddy: [taking out his wallet] \"Ta-da!\" [He shows off a postcard.] \"Like this one?\"\n\nEd: [awed] \"Eddy's brother's autograph!\" [He takes the card.] \"Thank you.\"\n\nEddy: \"Give it back, Ed! My brother sent me that postcard! You're gonna wreck it!\"\n\nEd: \"Autograph, Eddy!\"\n\nEddy: \"I'll autograph your head with my foot! Gimme it!\" [Edd takes it from Ed.]\nEd: \"Dive, captain, dive!\"\n\nEdd: \"A postcard? This could provide the very clue we need!\" [He examines it closely.]\nEddy: \"Hey! Gimme that!\"\n\nEdd: \"A postmark should lead us directly to\u2013drat! It's illegible!\" [The postmark is smeared.]\nEddy: [taking his postcard back] \"Gah! You probably smudged it.\"\nEdd spots Ed drawing on a cow.\nEdd: \"May I borrow this Ed?\" [He takes the crayon.] \"Thank you!\"\nEdd rushes away. Eddy meanwhile tucks his postcard back into his wallet. Suddenly, an udder slams into his face.\nEd: [showing off his artwork] \"Look, Eddy! A picture for Eddy's Brother! Do you think he'll like it?\"\n\nEddy: \"Um...hey, Sockhead, where'd ya go?\" [He looks for Edd. He finds Edd sticking leaves to a spiderweb.\nEdd: \"Eddy! I've found the link to key communitives we have with your brother! Among those, his shuddersome stink bomb recipes, his heinous hot sauces, oh and my favorite, malicious misleading treasure maps, together with other contentious callous cons, lead me to suspect your brother's quite the jokester.\"\n\nEddy: \"You better believe it! He's the king, baby!\" [Eddy twangs Edd's nose.]\nEdd: \"Yes, well, where could one groom this tendency to pranks and puerile practical jokes?\"\nA memory hits Ed.\nEd: \"I got it! It says so on my comic book!\" [He sticks it to the web.] \"Pranks and puerile practical jokes at the Lemon Brook Gag Factory.\"\n\nEdd: \"That's quite a coincidence.\"\n\nEddy: [tearing the comic away] \"Lemon Brook? Bunch of mascot-hating, lemon-sucking\u2013\" [Ed takes his comic back.]\nEd: \"Uh-uh, Eddy, no autograph, no comic book.\"\n\nEdd: \"That's it, Eddy! Your brother may very well work there! Or at the very least, be a regular customer!\"\n\nEddy: \"I bet he's there right now!\"\n\nEd: \"Oh boy oh boy, I forget what we're doing!\"\nEddy looks disgusted.Sarah and Jimmy skip past Eddy's house, carrying a basket. They enter the lane and come to a fence.\nSarah: \"On three, Jimmy. One...\"\n\nSarah and Jimmy: \"...two...three!\"\nThey toss the basket over the fence into Peach Creek Estates. They then pick it up on the other side and continue to run, giggling. This continues until they enter the woods, where Jimmy slows, then stops.\nSarah: [annoyed] \"What's the matter, Jimmy?\"\n\nJimmy: \"I'm not allowed to go in there, Sarah. I still have bad dreams, and my mom had to buy a mattress cover!\"\n\nSarah: [rolling her eyes] \"Okay, but you're really gonna miss a doozy!\"\nSarah skips into the trailer park.\nJimmy: [after a moment of contemplation] \"I hope Kevin knocks Eddy's teeth out!\" [He follows Sarah down the trail.] \"Wait for me, girlfriend!\"\nThe path forks. Sarah takes the right fork, but Jimmy, unable to see Sarah, chooses the left path. He trips over a piece of machinery and flies into a lawn chair. Bouncing off that, he flies into the air and falls into a wagon full of clothes. The wagon tips over, spilling its load behind May. All three Kankers look up.\nMarie: \"Oh, way to go, May!\"\n\nLee: \"Yeah! As if our laundry wasn't dirty enough! Quit holding up the line!\" [She slings a bucket of clothespins at May.]\nMay: [ducking] \"Watch it Lee!\" [The bucket hits the wagon and boomerangs back to hit May in the back of her head.] \"That didn't even hurt.\" [Marie hits her with a giant bag of soap.]\nMarie: \"Get back to work, snoutface. My skivvies ain't gonna wash themselves.\"\n\nLee: \"Heh. Snoutface. Good one, Marie.\"\nMay picks herself up off the ground. Jimmy peeks out and sees Lee pin an undershirt to the wire.\nMay: \"If you guys weren't such fashion hogs, there wouldn't be all this laundry to do!\" [She pulls Jimmy out from the pile.]\nJimmy: \"Oh, please! Don't hurt me!\"\n\nMay: \"Looks like someone left something in their pocket!\"\n\nLee: \"What is it?\"\n\nMarie: \"Looks like it's whats-his-face!\"\n\nMay: \"Let's call him Dutch.\"\n\nLee: [leering] \"A little far from home, aren't ya, Dutch?\"\n\nMay: \"Uh-oh, looks like Dutch needs a diaper!\"\n\nJimmy: [worried] \"I'm fine, really, I am!\"\n\nMay: \"Aw, he's squirming!\"\nMay pins him up and proceeds to nurse him with a bottle of ketchup. Lee steals Jimmy away.\nLee: \"Dutch ain't a baby.\" [She throws Jimmy down.] \"He's a big grown man.\" [sinister] \"I bet he wants a date.\" [after a few moments] \"WHERE'S MY FLOWERS DUTCH?!?!?\" [She giggles as Jimmy lies on the ground, twitching.]\nMarie: [picking him up] \"Aw, my man doesn't need to give me any flowers.\" [She drops him by the washing machine.] \"He just needs to do my laundry. Knock yourself out, Dutch.\"\n\nMay: [grabbing Jimmy] \"Babies don't do laundry!\"\n\nLee: \"He's mine!\" [She grabs Jimmy's arm.] \"Gimme my man.\"\n\nMarie: [taking Jimmy's other leg] \"Laundry boy's all mine, ladies.\"\n\nLee: \"Back off Marie.\"\n\nMay: \"Baby's mine!\"\nThe three tug at Jimmy, stretching his body.\nJimmy: \"I'm getting stretch marks!\" [Jimmy's pants split, revealing his teddy bear underwear.] \"Stop! I just wanted to see Ed, Edd n Eddy get clobbered!\"\nThe Kankers abruptly let go.\nLee: [menacing] \"What did you say about our boyfriends?\"\n\nSarah: \"None of your beeswax!\"\nThe Kankers turn to the fiery-headed newcomer. Sarah sets her basket down and seethes with rage. Tears of gratitude fill Jimmy's eyes.\nJimmy: \"My hero.\"\nThe Kankers jump his hero.\nJimmy: \"Leave her alone!\"\n\nSarah: \"Ah ah AAAAHH!!!\"\n\nJimmy: \"What'd she ever do to you?\" [Marie pins Sarah to the ground.]\nSarah: \"Get off me, lemme go!\"\nMarie giggles. May grabs Sarah's head and holds it in place.\nLee: \"So none of our beeswax, huh? What a shame.\"\nLee opens her mouth and sticks her finger in. When it comes out, it is covered with spit. May giggles in anticipation, and her sisters join in. May then turns Sarah's head on its side, and Lee holds her finger above Sarah. Spittle drips onto Sarah's cheek until Lee jams her finger into Sarah's ear, swishing it around in a Wet Willy.\nSarah: \"Ew that's so gross!\"\n\nJimmy: \"A Wet Willy! Oh, the horror!\"\n\nMarie: [as Lee works her finger] \"So tell us, twerp\u2013\"\n\nMay: \"\u2013what do you and Dutch know about our boyfriends!\"\n\nJimmy: \"Stop! Enough!\" [The torture stops as Jimmy comes running up.] \"The Eds did something really bad! Something big happened because everyone's angry, chasing after them to give them their just desserts!\" [crying] \"Ahhaha, I'm such a snitch!\"\n\nMay: \"Did you hear what Dutch said?\"\n\nMarie: [angry] \"Ain't nobody beating up on my man but me!\"\n\nLee: \"Grab the two squirts, girls. We're gonna need em.\"\nSarah and Jimmy look at each other, worry in their eyes.The Eds are walking through a field of sunflowers. Edd is using a strange device. Suddenly, Eddy runs up.\nEddy: \"Double D! Check this\u2013\" [He runs into Ed.]\nEdd: [staring at Ed] \"Oh, um...cute.\"\n\nEddy: \"No, no, not that! This.\" [He picks up a sunflower and slams it into Ed's face. Ed starts to chase him.] \"Uh oh.\"\n\nEd: \"I am the mighty Agamushin! I am from outer space!\"\n\nEddy: \"Don't bite me, oh Agam whatcha-whatchamacallit!\"\n\nEdd: [chuckling] \"Agamushin. A forest substrate. How apropos.\" [He looks through the device. Suddenly, Eddy grabs it.]\nEddy: \"What's that stupid thing? Can you see cartoons in it?\" [He spins it.] \"It's a wheeze-widdler!\"\nEd arrives, and Eddy smiles evilly.\nEd: \"I will eat you now!\"\nEddy uses the device on Ed's face. Soon, there is nothing left of Ed on top of his coat. Eddy looks in, and an arm reaches out from inside the jacket and grabs him. Ed sticks his head out of the armhole.\nEd: \"Gotcha, Eddy!\" [Eddy chuckles.]\nEdd: [angrily resetting the device] \"Yes, well, it's all fun and games, but merrymaking nearly cost us this sextant!\"\nEd and Eddy abruptly stop.\nEddy: \"You catch that, Ed?\" [to Edd] \"Ah, the what? I missed that. What's it called?\"\n\nEdd: \"It's called a sextant.\" [Ed begins to giggle.] \"An astronomical instrument used to\u2013\" [He stops.]\nEddy: \"Again, sorry, I missed it. What's it called?\"\n\nEdd: \"It's commonly known as a sextant, Eddy\u2013\" [Ed and Eddy burst into laughter. Edd thinks about it.]\nEd: \"Say it again, Double D!\"\n\nEdd: [realizing what he said] \"Oh my!\" [He blushes.] \"You won't be giggling when this unnamed device triangulates our position and gives us a precise heading to the true direction of the gag factory.\"\n\nEddy: \"Wanna bet?\"\n\nEdd: \"But in order for me to calculate our bearings to the gag factory, I'll need\u2013\" [He walks into a brick wall.]\nEd: \"Land ho!\" [He points to a loading dock for the building: the Lemon Brook Gag Factory.]\nEddy: \"This is it!\"\n\nEd: \"Gag factory, yay!\"\n\nEdd: \"Sanctuary at long last!\"\n\nEddy: [tugging on the doors] \"HEY BIG BRO! IT'S ME! EDDY!\"\n\nEdd: \"Perhaps the front doors will yield a response!\"\n\nEddy: \"Good idea! I forgot my big bro hates back doors.\"\n\nEd: \"Me too! We are so alike!\"\n\nEddy: \"Yeah right.\"\nThe Eds run to the front doors of the factory.Wilfred is following the trail. He stumbles down a hill as he leads Rolf into the field of cows.\nRolf: \"Hmm. Wilfred, look! What barbarian would allow their secreting masses of flesh to wander the field? Rolf fears a omen has befallen us.\" [He halts Wilfred and throws down a bucket.] \"Guard the provisions. Rolf will interrogate this caboodle of bovine discord.\"\nRolf climbs down. As he does so, he knocks a string of sausages loose. They dangle in front of Wilfred, and Wilfred begins to follow them.\nRolf: \"Hal-low.\"\nRolf has found an extremely fat cow. He milks it. Once finished, he moves out and grabs the bucket, not noticing that Wilfred has walked off. Rolf sips deeply of the milk.\nRolf: [finishing] \"The interrogation is complete, Wilfred. Nothing to fear.\" [He jumps.] \"NAH-SHIZ-LOW!!!\"\nLying in front of Rolf is a cow. What scares Rolf is not the cow, but the cow's udder. What scares Rolf is not the udder, but the drawing on it\u2013a mustached Eddy with \"I \u2665 Bro\" on his shirt.\nRolf: \"Has the world lost its mind? The Ed-boys now have desecrated the sack of sustenance! Come, Wilfred! The Ed-boys must not escape!\"\nRolf looks around for Wilfred, but can't find him anywhere.\nRolf: \"Wilfred!\" [Wilfred does not appear.] \"Wilfred?\" [A long shot of the field shows that Wilfred is gone.] \"WILFRED!!!\"Ed's head slams into the door to the factory before finally breaking through.\nEd: \"Knock knock, I am Ed!\" [Eddy kicks the door open.]\nEddy: \"Where is he? Do you see him?\" [The factory is completely dark and nonoperational.] \"Where ya hidin at, ya big lug?\"\nThe Eds stop in the middle of the factory. The door slams behind them.]\nEd: \"Ollie ollie oxen free!\" [He runs through the factory.] \"Oh look, lots of stuffy stuff.\"\n\nEddy: \"Bro! It's me, Eddy! You know\u2013Pipsqueak?\" [He looks around.] \"Where is everybody? Are you sure this is the gag factory? 'Cause I ain't laughin.\"\n\nEd: [wearing a pair of gag glasses] \"Looks gaggy to me, Eddy.\"\n\nEdd: \"Ed, comic book, please.\"\n\nEddy: \"Man that joke's old.\"\n\nEdd: \"Exactly! This publication was printed over ten years ago!\"\n\nEd: \"Revolt of the Rotting Brains! A classic.\"\n\nEddy: \"This comic's useless!\" [He tosses it away.]\nEd: \"Eddy!\" [He gallops around, looking for it.] \"Oh where, oh where has my rotting brain gone!\"\n\nEddy: \"We're hooped!\" [He collapses to the dusty floor.] \"We'll never find my brother, Double D.\"\n\nEdd: \"Never say never, Eddy. Perhaps old customer receipts or employee records will unearth a clue to his whereabouts.\"\n\nEd: \"Choo choo!\" [He pushes a heavy box into Eddy.] \"Oh, look! Boxes stuffed with stuff!\"\n\nEdd: \"Not again! Ed! We'll never make headway if you keep rummaging for\u2013\" [A rubber chicken hits him.]\nEd: \"Chickens, Double D! Oh I love them to death I do!\"\n\nEddy: \"Can't have a party without a rubber chicken, Double D! Big bro said so.\"\n\nEdd: \"Edifying.\" [He approaches some stairs.] \"I'll go examine the factory's filing cabinets and see what I can find.\" [He starts the climb.]\nEddy: [to Ed] \"What else you got in there, lummox?\"Edd stands at the office door. He tugs on rubber gloves and a surgical mask before entering. Inside, the lights switch on. Outside, Ed and Eddy are still looking for toys. Eddy finds something and hides it behind his back.]\nEddy: \"Oh, Ed...\" [He holds out the item.] \"Gum?\"\n\nEd: \"Lucky me!\" [He grabs a stick and pulls. The gum then proceeds to give him a severe electrical shock.]\nEddy: [laughing] \"What a chump!\" [Suddenly, he grabs his stomach.] \"My stomach, Ed! I think I'm gonna\u2013BLLAAAH!\" [He tosses some fake vomit onto the floor.]\nEd: \"Pardon me, miss, but I think you dropped your lunch!\" [He throws it back down.]\nEddy: \"Hey, quit tossing my cookies!\"\n\nEd: \"I upped your chuck, Eddy!\"\n\nEddy: \"Looks real, don't it?\"\n\nEd: \"No home should be without one, Eddy!\"\nThey break into raucous laughter as Edd, upstairs, fiddles with the files. He finds the employee file and opens it, only to dump the contents out; they're so old, they have crumbled into dust.\nEdd: [disgusted] \"Goodness.\"\nEdd slams the cabinet shut and is thanked with a cloud of dust to his face. He then walks over to the trashcan and tosses away his mask before turning back to the file cabinet, labeler in hand.\nEdd: [exiting the office] \"Have you two forgotten why we're here?\" [He removes his gloves.] \"Eddy?\"\nDownstairs is nothing but silence. His friends have gone missing. Edd walks to the factory floor.\nEdd: \"Ed? Hello!\" [Nobody replies.] \"Oh, for Pete's sake. If this is some kind of foolish joke you're playing, it's not funny.\"\nEdd walks around the dark, silent factory floor. Not finding his friends, he becomes scared.\nEdd: \"Eddy? Ed?\"\nA gear wheel clatters to the floor and rolls out from a gap between two machines. Edd approaches the gap.\nEdd: \"Is anyone there?\"\nEddy steps out. He has a hatchet buried in his head.\nEddy: \"RUN DOUBLE D! Save yourself...\" [He crumples to the ground.]\nEdd: \"EDDY! THIS CAN'T BE!\" [He stumbles backwards into Ed, who has a fork through his head.]\nEd: [eyes rolled back in his skull] \"If looks could kill I'd be dead.\"\n\nEdd: \"AAH! AAH! AAAH!\"\n\nEd: [laughing and mocking him] \"Aah! Aah! Help me! Help me! I'm Double D!\" [Eddy joins in.]\nEddy: [lifting the hatchet] \"It's a gag, see? What'd ya, fall off the back of a truck?\"\n\nEd: [still giggling] \"Aw, we're sorry, Double D. Jelly bean?\" [He holds out a can.]\nEdd: \"Why, thank you, Ed. These should prove quite comforting, and I am a bit peckish.\" [He tries to open the lid twice, with no success.] \"A stubborn lid, this.\" [He strains and finally breaks the seal.] \"Ah, success.\"The factory bulges and explodes, raining down a tremendous amount of rubber snakes. The snakes fall all over in a rain, landing on a roadway. They fall everywhere, including on Nazz and Kevin. Kevin picks one up.\nNazz: \"Whoa! What's that?\"\n\nKevin: [spotting the factory] \"Dorks.\" [He grins evilly.Wilfred has come to rest under a tree and is chewing on some sausages. He hears Rolf calling.\nRolf: \"Hallo! Wilfred?\"\nWilfred noses into the bushes and peeps out. He sees Rolf searching for him.\nRolf: \"Rolf is so sad! This is true! Like a little shrinking un-plucked billy goat, Rolf cries and cries and cries!\"\nBehind Rolf's back is a shoe. Rolf smacks it against his hand. At this, Wilfred's eyes widen, and he charges.\nRolf: \"Stay back, or you will meet Rolf's shoe!\" [Wilfred attacks Rolf.] \"Mama, assist Rolf! The sow has ruptured! Wilfred!\" [Wilfred clamps down on Rolf's stomach.] \"Stop! Release Rolf!\"\nWilfred lets go, and Rolf's stack falls on him. Wilfred wriggles out and runs away, squealing. Rolf crawls from the wreckage, a strange device over his head.\nRolf: \"Wilfred?\" [wrestling with it] \"This thing must come\u2013\" [It snaps back onto his head.The Eds are walking through another wooded area.\nEd: [laughing] \"Oh boy, Eddy, did you see him go flying? He flew like a canoe!\" [pointing to a snake] \"This doesn't even look like a jellybean!\"\n\nEddy: \"Just keep your eyes peeled, chuckles.\"\n\nEdd: [yelling from far away] \"Assistance please!\"\n\nEd: \"I think he flew over here, Eddy!\"\n\nEddy: \"Where?\"\n\nEd: [uprooting a tree] \"What?\"\n\nEddy: \"What?\"\n\nEd: \"Who?\"\n\nEdd: \"HEEELLLPPP!\"\n\nEd: \"Double D!\" [He tosses the tree over his shoulder and runs towards the sound.]\nEddy: \"Hey!\" [The tree lands on Eddy.]\nEd: [looking under a bush] \"See?\"\n\nEddy: \"Why you dirty\u2013\"\n\nEd: \"Tag! You're it!\"\n\nEddy: \"You're dead!\"\nEddy chases Ed off a cliff.]\nEd: \"Look, I'm Double D! I'm flying!\"\nThey land next to a river.\nEddy: \"Idiot.\" [A shoe hits him.]\nEdd: \"Get me down from here!\"\nEdd is hanging from a ledge on top of a waterfall by his hat.\nEd: \"Hi Double D!\"\n\nEddy: \"Hey Sockhead, can you see my bro's place from up there?\"\n\nEdd: [angry] \"NO!!!! Now get me down!\"\n\nEddy: \"You heard him, lumpy.\"\n\nEdd: \"Hurry please, I'm afraid I can't hold on for much longer gentlemen!\"\n\nEddy: \"Hit him with something, Ed! Something big!\"\nEd throws Eddy at Edd. He scores a direct hit, and the two fall into the water at the waterfall's base. When they hit, all the water is splashed upwards, and a bunch of buried treasure is revealed. The water comes down, soaking everything in the vicinity.\nEd: [drenched and shivering] \"Cold!\"\nEdd and Eddy crawl out of the water. Eddy drags Edd onto dry land with his upper lip, which has gotten wedged in Edd's gap.\nEd: [impressed] \"Fancy trick, Eddy! Where'd you learn to do that?\"\n\nEdd: \"How mortifying!\"\n\nEddy: \"My big bro showed me!\"\n\nEd: \"Do tell!\"\n\nEddy: \"Yep, my bro's a whiz at harpooning whales!\"\n\nEdd: [upset] \"He is? Your brother is a whaler?\"\n\nEddy: \"My mom's got fifty pounds of blubber in the freezer as we speak!\"\n\nEdd: \"You mean all this time\u2013\"\n\nEd: \"That's more blubber than my mom's got!\"\n\nEddy: \"And he's got a peg leg too! But that's what you get for wrestling walruses.\"\n\nEdd: \"Eddy! If your brother is a whaler, then he must reside by the sea!\"\n\nEd: \"How do we find it, Double D?\"\n\nEdd: \"It's quite simple, Ed. You see, this stream is a veritable highway that will lead us straight to it. We merely need to float upon the current, and it will carry us to its opening and Eddy's brother's retreat.\"Sarah strains against bonds that tie her back. She and Jimmy have been forced to drag the Kankers' wagon along, acting like horses for the Kankers. Jimmy falters and falls.\nSarah: \"You've gotta get up, Jimmy!\"\n\nJimmy: \"I'm not gonna make it, Sarah!\"\n\nLee: \"Quit your squawkin and keep it movin!\" [She picks up Sarah and turns her forward again.\nMarie: \"Yeah, you heard her. We got boyfriends to save.\"\nSarah growls, but then gets an idea. She smiles to herself sinisterly before turning around, a more sincere smile on her face.\nSarah: \"Gee, Lee, I love your toenail polish!\"\n\nLee: \"I said move\u2013\" [Lee realizes what Sarah said.] \"Isn't that adorable? The kid wants to be just like us! Aww.\"\n\nMay: \"Who doesn't?\"\n\nMarie: \"She's kinda homely, if you ask me.\"\n\nLee: \"Nobody's askin, Marie!\" [She turns to Sarah with a bucket of paint.] \"Here, kid. Knock yourself out.\"\n\nSarah: \"Golly gee whilikers, thanks Lee!\"\nSarah grabs the paint and proceeds to slam it down onto Lee's hand. Lee screams in pain.\nLee: \"YEEOOWWCHHH!!!\"\nSarah brings the bucket up into Lee's chin. Lee goes flying backwards.\nLee: \"We got chisled, girls!\"\n\nSarah: [lifting Jimmy's chains] \"Move it Jimmy!\"\n\nMarie: \"I got em Lee!\"\n\nMay: \"Wait Marie\u2013\"\nMarie dives at them. This knocks them forward and provides the wagon with momentum. Unfortunately, it also knocks May off balance so that she can't aim her slingshot. May tumbles off, and the wagon sails forwards towards Lee.\nSarah: \"Jimmy!\"\nSarah grabs Jimmy's legs and manages to pull him free. The wagon continues forward, Marie still on it, and hits Lee. They slam into a tree and stay there, pinned.\nLee: \"Why you little brats! Teach em a lesson, May!\" [May begins to chase them in circles.\nMay: \"You bet, Lee!\"\n\nJimmy: \"Ow, ah!\"\n\nMay: [trying to grab them] \"I gotcha! I gotcha! I gotcha. I gotcha!\"A familiar pair of legs tramples down the sidewalk. They run down the street. Suddenly, a rope with a melon tied to its end goes flying. It crashes down on the sidewalk, and the rope goes slack, carving a straight line down the street. The rope tightens and the melon begins to move, coming forward until it hits a mailbox. There, it stops and holds steady, while our hero climbs it. He clambers onto the mailbox and looks in at the mail. Seeing no sign of trouble, he shuts the door.\nCaptain Melonhead: \"No sign of those fiends here, Splinter!\"\nCaptain Melonhead zooms off again. Spying the candy store, he decides to check the gumball machine.\nCaptain Melonhead: \"No Eds here!\"\n\nSplinter the Wonderwood:\nCaptain Melonhead: \"Whaddya mean we ain't gettin anywhere?\"\n\nSplinter the Wonderwood:\nCaptain Melonhead: \"We're takin the what?\"\nSplinter pulls him forward.\nCaptain Melonhead: \"A bus?\"\n\nSplinter the Wonderwood:\nCaptain Melonhead: \"My melon rind senses trouble, chum!\" [despondent] \"I've never taken a bus before.\"\n\nSplinter the Wonderwood:\nCaptain Melonhead: \"Huh? Nothing to it?\"\n\nSplinter the Wonderwood:\nCaptain Melonhead: \"Boy, Plank, you sure turn into a fireball when you're wearing a mask! Okay then. If it means we bring down those three maniacs, we're takin a bus to justice!\"The door to the factory creaks open. Kevin sticks his head in. Seeing nobody, he wheels his bike in. Nazz follows, shutting the door behind her. The factory is littered with the snakes.\nNazz: \"Dude! What's with all these stupid snake things?\"\n\nKevin: \"Shup!\"\n\nNazz: [pointing to the office] \"Kevin, look!\"\n\nKevin: \"You are so on fire today, Nazz.\"\nTo emphasize this, he punches Nazz in the shoulder and heads up the stairs. Kevin kicks open the door and it crumbles to dust. He looks for the Eds.\nKevin: \"Hmm...\"\n\nNazz: \"Kev?\"\n\nKevin: \"They were here, I can feel it.\"\nKevin opens a drawer and finds a bunch of chattering teeth.\nNazz: [scared] \"Get it, Kevin!\" [A toy rat is running in circles.]\nKevin: [shoving her aside and examining the rat] \"What is this, a joke?\"\nNazz, who has fallen into the file cabinet, rubs her head. At that moment, a drawer behind her slides open, bashing her on the head again. Nazz slams it shut, and a label reading \"Dusty Dusty Dusty\" peels off.\nKevin: [crushing the rat] \"Those three two-timing twerps are really getting to me, man.\"\n\nNazz: [handing him the label] \"Hey Kev, check this out!\"\n\nKevin: \"Dusty dusty dusty? I don't get it.\"\n\nNazz: \"Sounds like something Double D would say. Don'tcha think?\" [moving closer] \"Don't ya?\"\nSuddenly, the floor beneath her crumbles, and she falls. Nazz hits a switch for a machine, and it turns on. The factory awakens, grumbling into life. The lights come on and a bell rings. The machinery begins moving for perhaps the first time in 10 years.\nNazz: \"Ow! Oh!\"\n\nKevin: \"Nazz!\"\n\nNazz: \"Kevin!\"\n\nKevin: [spotting Nazz] \"You okay?\"\n\nNazz: \"What was up with that?\"\nA thump comes and they turn to the source. Another machine is turning on. Coincidentally, this happens to have a large paddlewheel contraption. Even more coincidentally, Kevin's bike is parked against it. The bike begins to be raised by the wheel.\nKevin: \"Not my bike!\"\n\nNazz: \"I'll get it!\" [trying to grab it] \"I think I can reach it, Kev.\"\nHer shirt snags on the wheel, and she gets lifted up.\nKevin: \"Hang on!\"\n\nNazz: [pointing to the lever] \"I fell on that thing! Over there!\"\nKevin rushes over and begins to strain against it.\nNazz: \"Dude! What's taking you?\"\nKevin turns around. Seeing his bike about to topple, he panics.\nKevin: \"Gah! I'm coming, babe!\"\nThe bike falls into the machine, but Kevin grabs it. Nazz sees this.\nNazz: \"Hey! What are you doing?\" [She falls into the machine.] \"Kevin!\"\nNazz slams into Kevin, and both of them fall into the funnel, followed by the bike.Edd works on the boat while Eddy relaxes in the shade. Suddenly, Ed grabs him.\nEd: \"Eddy!\" [showing him the boat] \"It's a duck! See?\"\n\nEddy: [angry] \"I thought you were making a boat!\"\n\nEdd: \"And a boat it is, Eddy.\" [polishing it] \"It mimics the common mallard in order to offer minimal disruption to the local fauna.\"\n\nEddy: [excited] \"It's got a sauna?\"\n\nEd: [jamming his head into Edd's face] \"Saunas make me sweat! More.\"\nEdd tries to get loose. He does, but in the process loses his hat.\nEddy: \"My eyes! They're burning!\"\n\nEdd: \"You stop that!\"\n\nEd: \"Does it hurt, Double D?\"\n\nEdd: \"Oh shush!\" [He grabs his hat back and cleans it.] \"Can we please get down to the business at hand?\" [putting his hat on] \"Thank you. Ed, drumroll, please?\"\n\nEddy: \"For what?\"\nEd chuckles, pulls up his shirt, and begins to drum on his belly.\nEdd: \"By the authority vested in me, sanctioned by want, I hereby christen this seaworthy vessel, the esteemed, um\u2013\" [reading the writing on the side] \"S. S. Mutant Almost A Chicken Duck?\" [Ed chuckles.]\nEddy: \"Surprised you didn't run out of paint.\"\n\nEdd: \"Stand clear, gentlemen!\"\nEdd swings the bottle forward. Unfortunately, it runs out of momentum just short of the side and hangs there, swinging. Eddy laughs.\nEddy: \"Hey muscles! Can we go now? My bro'll make us eat a barnacle if we show up while he's watching Matlock.\"\n\nEdd: \"Really?\"\n\nEd: [excited] \"He's gonna feed us, Eddy?\"\n\nEddy: \"Heck yeah! He was the royal cook for the king of Englishland.\"\n\nEdd: \"You mean England, Eddy.\"\n\nEd: \"Alley-oop!\" [He pulls the boat into the water.] \"Aah!\"\n\nEddy: \"And away we go! It ain't nothin but smooth sailin straight to big bro's place, boys!\"May runs through the field of sunflowers, looking for their captives.\nMay: \"Where'd they go?\"\n\nLee: \"You see em May?\" [She runs into May.]\nMarie: \"Watch your back!\" [She runs into Lee.]\nLee: [shoving Marie away] \"Get off me!\"\n\nMay: [getting up] \"I coulda sworn they went this-a-way!\"\n\nMarie: \"You'd lose your head if it weren't nailed down.\"\n\nMay: \"My head ain't nailed!\"\nAbove them, Sarah and Jimmy cower, clinging to the leaves of a sunflower.\nMarie: \"It's made of wood, ain't it?\"\n\nMay: \"No it's not.\"\n\nMarie: \"Yes it is.\"\n\nMay: \"No it's not!\" [A ladybug crawls onto Jimmy.]\nMarie: \"Pinocchio head.\" [Jimmy opens his mouth to scream.]\nMay: [whining] \"Lee, Marie swore!\" [Sarah clamps her hand over Jimmy's mouth.]\nLee: [grabbing them] \"Why don't you two quit thinkin about yourselves\u2013\" [slamming them together] \"\u2013and think about our boyfriends!\" [They slump to the ground. Sarah looks at the ladybug.] \"They need us more than ever, girls.\"\nSarah reaches out and thwacks the ladybug with her finger. The bug flies off and hits a sunflower. Lee looks up, alert, and runs in its direction.\nLee: [to her sisters] \"Move it!\"\nMay and Marie shake off their daze and run after their sister. Sarah and Jimmy slide down from the sunflower.\nSarah: \"I think they're gone, Jimmy.\" [turning to go in the other direction] \"Ssh! Let's get the heck outta here.\"\nThey crawl through the field. Suddenly, a loud snorting catches their attention.\nJimmy: \"Forest imps!\"\nSarah lifts a leaf out of the way and sees Wilfred.\nSarah: \"Ew, it's a pig!\"\n\nJimmy: \"That's Rolf's piggie, Sarah!\" [patting it] \"Hello, Wilfred!\"\n\nSarah: \"Don't touch it! Enough with the pig, let's just go.\" [Wilfred noses at Jimmy.]\nJimmy: \"He must smell the sweet aroma of my no-time nibble.\" [unwrapping the caramel apple] \"See? My candied apple, Sarah.\"\n\nLee: [offscreen] \"Why's this place look familiar?\"\n\nMarie: \"That's 'cause we're just walking around in a circle.\" [Sarah grabs the apple from Jimmy and dangles it in front of the pig. They clamber on and ride out of the sunflower patch.]\nMay: \"But that would mean we're lost!\"\n\nMarie: \"I know, woodhead.\"A bus pulls up to the curb. It's doors open and we see our heroes, ready to venture into the world so they may find and defeat the villainous scumbags Ed, Edd, and Eddy. Once Captain Melonhead sees the inside of the bus, though, his courage wavers.\nCaptain Melonhead: \"Whoa.\"\nCaptain Melonhead and Splinter the Wonderwood climb aboard and nervously deposit five quarters into the collection box. He is about to take a seat when the bus moves forward, sending him tumbling into a man's legs.\nCaptain Melonhead: \"Oh! Sorry mister.\" [quieter] \"Buses sure pack a wallop, huh Plank.\"\nSplinter the Wonderwood is nowhere to be found.\nCaptain Melonhead: [scared] \"Plank!?!?\" [He begins to search for his sidekick.] \"Buddy? Quit freaking me out, Plank!\" [He stumbles into a woman's rump.] \"Oh! Sorry! Excuse me! Pardon me! Has anybody seen my pal?\"\nCaptain Melonhead stumbles through a veritable jungle of legs, looking all over for his best friend. When he makes it to the front, he clings to a pole for dear life. However, when our brave captain looks at the driver, he sees an unexpected sight.\nCaptain Melonhead: \"Plank! Was that you?\"\nSplinter the Wonderwood has commandeered the bus. The destination name changes from 160 Downtown to VENGEANCE. Splinter steers the bus downtown as Captain Melonhead joyfully rejoices in finding his friend again.\nCaptain Melonhead: \"PPLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNNKKKKKKKK!!!!\"The duck boat sits in a swamp, its neck broken and its body abandoned. As we watch, it lifts it's head a few inches before dropping the beak back into the murky water. It does this again.\nEddy: [annoyed] \"Where's your fauna now, Mr. Duck Boat?\"\n\nEdd: \"The collision was unavoidable, Eddy! It was the unpredictable current that proved unfavorable!\"\n\nEddy: [slapping a mosquito] \"Unbelievable! All I know is we're stuck in a swamp off the middle of nowhere!\" [He uses his shirt as a bandana.] \"Big bro ain't gonna be impressed.\" [He slaps another mosquito.]\nEdd: [on the edge] \"Is that what you think? That I'm here to impress your brother?\" [Ed crawls from the swamp.] \"That I would forsake my home and family for something as trivial as\u2013\"\n\nEd: \"Buttered toast!\" [He dives into the water.]\nEdd: [on a new tack] \"Perhaps we should talk about you and Ed's immature behavior.

The rope lands on top of the sand. His friends are no more.\nEdd: \"No. NO. NOOOO!!!!!!!!!!\" [He frantically searches through the mud.] \"Where are you? Eddy! Ed! Oh don't you give up on me! Answer me!\" [He gives up and begins to cry.] \"Please?\" [weeping] \"Why oh why did you listen to me? This is all my fault! I should have never let you leave the cul-de-sac!\"\nAs Edd cries, a handkerchief is held out to him. Edd reaches for it.\nEdd: \"Thank you, Ed. Goodness, Ed, that's filthy.\"\nEdd's eyes bulge. Ed and Eddy are in front of him, covered in mud but otherwise no worse for wear.\nEddy: [grinning] \"Gotcha.\" [The two burst into laughter. Edd stands up.] \"Man, you're such a sap! This muck's only ankle deep! Can't sink in it!\"\n\nEd: \"Got that right, Eddy! Because sinks are Mother Nature's own cereal bowl!\" [Edd turns around and walks off.]\nEddy: \"Hey Sockhead, where you going?\" [disgruntled] \"You got somewhere to be? What?\"\nEdd walks through the swamp until he reaches a dock. He heaves himself up onto it. Water drips off of him, and he slips on it. Edd makes a label reading \"Caution\", slaps it on a puddle, and continues walking.\nEddy: \"Hey!\" [He and Ed follow Edd.] \"Where ya goin? You're headin back into the swamp!\" [reaching for Edd's shoulder] \"My bro don't live\u2013\"\n\nEdd: [slapping his hand away] \"Don't you dare touch me!\" [releasing his repressed rage] \"A sap? Well excuse my sincerity, but thinking I had lost the only two people I have left in this world\u2013\"\n\nEddy: [smiling, sure Edd's putting on an act] \"And?\"\n\nEdd: [angrier] \"It's surprising, because your stubborn, inane desire to shock, sandbag and swindle is what put us here in the first place!\"\n\nEd: [indignant] \"I helped too!\"\nEdd turns to Ed angrily. Edd then turns back to Eddy and resumes his rant.\nEdd: \"You and your nefarious scams!\"\n\nEddy: [angry as well] \"Like you were picking daisies!

Pain!\"\n\nEdd: \"I've had enough!\" [He kicks Eddy off.] \"I'm returning home!\"\n\nEd: \"But we can't go home, Double D!\"\n\nEdd: \"I'd rather face my consequences, Ed, than wander aimlessly with a so-called friend!\"\nAs he storms off, Eddy's eyes fill with tears.\nEd: \"Say it ain't so! We are three no more, Eddy! Like hop, skip, and no jump! Like up, up and no away! Like blah, blah without the other blah!\"\n\nEddy: [snapping] FINE! GO HOME! I DON'T BLAME YA! 'CAUSE EVERYTHING WAS MY FAULT!\" [bursting into tears] \"YEAH, YOU HEARD ME! A FOUL-UP WANNABE LOSER!\" [He cries. Edd turns back.]\nEdd: \"Eddy?\"\n\nEddy: [sobbing] \"What?\"\n\nEdd: \"Your shirt, Eddy.\"\n\nEddy: [turning to face him, confused] \"My shirt?\"\n\nEdd: [pointing at it] \"Are those salt deposits from your lamentation?\"\nEddy looks down. Edd quickly thwacks his nose.\nEdd: \"Gotcha!\"\n\nEd: [cheering] \"WE ARE FRIENDS ONCE MORE, GUYS!\" [He hugs them close.] \"To Eddy's big bro's house!\" [He carries them on his shoulders.]\nEdd: \"Not that way, Ed.\" [He turns Ed in the right direction.] \"This way.\"\n\nEddy: \"You heard my pal, Ed!\"\n\nEdd: \"What would you do without me, Eddy?\"\n\nEddy: \"Don't milk it, Sockhead.\"A rumbling and and screaming from a pipe as a heavy load travels along it. The pipe spits its load out in the swamp. The load in question is Nazz. She is quickly followed by a second load consisting of Kevin and his bike. Kevin is spit out behind Nazz, and he runs over her with his bike. When he finally stops it, he is in a clearing. Kevin quickly removes his shirt and uses it to sponge off his soaked bike as an angry Nazz arrives.\nNazz: [angry] \"How's your bike!\"\n\nKevin: [oblivious] \"Oh, hey Nazz.\"\nNazz slaps Kevin.\nKevin: [confused] \"What was that for, man?\"\n\nNazz: [through her teeth] \"It's late, and I'm cold.\"\nNazz and Kevin stare at each other for a few seconds.\nNazz: \"Fine. I'll make the fire.\" [She stomps off.]\nKevin: [slapping a mosquito] \"Sweet.\"Nazz rubs two sticks together. When this fails to get a spark, she tries again. Finally she smacks the sticks on the kindling. When this doesn't work, she throws them on the kindling. At this moment, the wood erupts into flame. Nazz warms her hands by the fire.\nKevin: \"Wicked fire, Nazz. Can I join you?\"\nNazz ignores him.\nKevin: \"Um, I got a peanut butter sandwich. I'll split it with ya.\"\nNazz grabs the whole sandwich and scarfs it. Kevin's stomach rumbles, and he moves closer to Nazz.\nKevin: \"Sure could use another sandwich.\" [He places his hand on her arm.]\nNazz: [forgiving him] \"Yeah...sorry about that, dude.\"\n\nKevin: \"Aw, don't sweat it, doll.\"\nKevin puts his arm around her, and Nazz reciprocates. They come closer together.\nNazz: \"Kev? Sorry I slapped you. It's been like such a crazy day today.\"\n\nKevin: \"No foolin.\"\n\nNazz: \"No foolin.\"\n\nKevin: \"Wait, don't move.\"\nKevin leaves. Nazz clasps her hands in anticipation of a gift.\nKevin: \"Almost left her out in the cold.\"\nKevin has come back with his bike. Nazz's eyes bulge.\nKevin: \"Bad for the paint, y'know?\"\nNazz shoves him away from the bike, grabs it, and runs with it. She then winds up and throws it into the swamp. It hits a tree and lodges there.\nNazz: \"THAT'S WHAT I THINK OF YOUR STUPID BIKE!\"\nKevin runs into the swamp and begins to clamber up the tree.\nKevin: \"I just don't get her, man.\"\n\nNazz: [offscreen] \"Whoa! Help!\"\nKevin looks back towards their campsite. Nazz is gone and the fire has been extinguished. Kevin quickly runs back.\nKevin: \"Yo, Nazz! Where are ya?\"The moon shines down brightly on the swamp. Below, yet another vengeance seeker is looking for the Eds. He cuts a more pitiful figure than most, though. This is mainly owing to the fact that he is wearing a strange helmet on his head and appears to be blind. This is accentuated when he runs into a tree.\nRolf: \"Who goes there?\"\nRolf punches straight through the tree. He then tries to yank his arm free. When he does so, he breaks the tree in three and falls in the water. The third part is the section he punched, which remains stubbornly around his wrist. He gropes for shore; finding it, he hauls himself up.\nRolf: \"I'll get you, insubordinate\u2013\"\nThe tree slams into him. Fortunately, it cracks as a direct result of this. Rolf, dazed by the blow, staggers around in the middle of the road. At this moment, a truck horn honks and lights shine on Rolf's face.\nRolf: \"Hallo?\"\nThe horn honks again right before the truck hits Rolf. Rolf is knocked backwards by the blow, but some good comes of this; the helmet breaks, allowing Rolf to see again. The truck then pulls to a stop, and its' lights shine on Rolf's face. Suddenly, we are able to see that the truck is in fact the Kanker sisters' wagon, the lights are flashlights mounted on it, and the horn is a clown horn.\nLee: [leering] \"Looks like we lucked out, girls.\"\n\nMarie: \"It's one of them! Who's after our boyfriends!\"\nThe Kankers grab Rolf.The Eds trundle down the road. Fireflies start to gather.\nEd: \"Look! Alien spaceships are attacking!\" [Edd takes out a jar and captures them.]\nEddy: \"That's stupid.\"\n\nEdd: \"Call it Lampyridae, Ed.\"\n\nEddy: \"Say what?\"\n\nEdd: \"Fireflies, Eddy. These nocturnal luminescent beetles will help shed light on our journey.\"\n\nEd: \"Fancy bug butts, I must say.\" [He yawns.]\nEddy: [tapping the jar] \"So these things know where my bro lives?\" [He yawns.]\nEdd: \"Hardly.\" [He yawns.] \"Oh, pardon me. But they can help us find a safe place to rest for the night.\"\n\nEddy: \"We passed a motel a ways back. We coulda stopped there.\" [He yawns.]\nEdd: \"Motels cost money, Eddy.\" [He yawns.] \"Excuse me. Have you any money, Eddy?\"\n\nEddy: [after a yawn] \"I would if that stupid scam worked.\"\nEd leads them into a clearing and sits down.\nEd: \"Ed pooped. Sleepytime guys.\" [He yawns.]\nEdd: \"An appropriate place as any, I suppose.\"\n\nEd: \"Nighty night!\"\nEd burrows into the ground and wiggles around until he finds a big rock. He then lies against it, using the dirt as a blanket.\nEd: \"Ahh, comfy.\" [Eddy snickers, and Edd goes off to do something. Ed taps Eddy on the back with his foot.] \"Psst! Psst! Eddy, can I have a good night kiss?\"\n\nEddy: \"What are ya?\" [He tries to pull himself free, and instead pulls him to another rock before getting loose.]\nEdd: [stepping over Ed] \"Excuse me Ed.\" [He labels the rock.]\nEddy: [peeling off the label and reading it] \"Yet. Another. Boulder.\"\nHe looks up and sees that Edd has labeled the entire campsite.\nEddy: \"Hey Sockhead, quit turning everything into your bedroom!\"\n\nEdd: \"It's just that it's difficult for me to sleep in an unlabeled environment.\"\n\nEddy: \"Snore! I'm getting some shut-eye.\" [He tries, but almost falls off the rock. When he clambers back on, he tries another position, but this one hurts his back.] \"This bed's killing me!\"\n\nEd: \"Trade ya, Eddy!\"\n\nEddy: \"Quit talking in your sleep, Ed.\"The sun dawns brightly, beaming down on a picturesque field. The picture is only marred by a despondent boy wheeling his bike across the grass. The boy looks exhausted, as though he's been up all night.\nKevin: \"Oh, what's the use? Probably getting back at me. For what, I don't know.\"\nHe spots a speck of mud on his bike and tries to clean it. Suddenly, he spots something, and his eyes bulge. He looks at it; it is Eddy. Eddy jumps in fear and clambers over a rock to a hiding spot.\nKevin: \"Eddy?\" [Rejuvenated, he leaps on his bike and gives chase.] \"Eddy!\"\nEddy's feet pound the ground as he races to escape Kevin.\nKevin: \"Time's up, Dorko!\"Marie, disguised as Eddy, rounds a corner and ducks behind a tree stump to where her sisters are.\nMarie: [removing the hairpiece] \"What a drip! He fell for it like a ton of canned hams.\"\nKevin is picking up speed when May is suddenly stuck into his path. Kevin's body slams into the human block and wraps around her. His bike continues at it's high pace and slams into a concrete barrier, crumpling into a complete wreck.\nLee: [unravelling Kevin] \"So watch where you ride, huh tough guy?\"\n\nKevin: \"NOOOO!!!!\"Edd is snoring peacefully away. His friends are snoring as well. Suddenly, Edd sniffs the air. Catching a foul odor, he awakens. Looking up, he sees that he and his friends have in the night huddled together, and that Ed's butt is currently resting on his head.\nEdd: \"Is that Ed's\u2013\" [He quickly gets up. Ed falls onto Eddy.] \"Good lord! Horrid! Icky! Foul!\" [after a beat] \"Oh, who am I kidding. I just slept in my clothes!\"\nEdd goes over to the jar of fireflies and opens it. Eddy begins to fight his way out from under Ed.\nEddy: [throwing Ed off] \"GET OFF!\" [Ed lands in front of him.] \"Shoulda stayed at that motel.\"\nSuddenly, a deep rumbling is heard, and an earthquake occurs. Ed stands up.\nEd: [belly rumbling] \"Yep. Belly's empty. Breakfast, Double D?\"\n\nEdd: \"I'm afraid we haven't any food, Ed.\"\n\nEd: [panicking] \"Food for Ed! Eat now! Ed hungry! Eddy, belly sad!\" [He pulls out Eddy's hairs.] \"Breakfast for Ed, Eddy!\" [Ed gallops off, desperately searching for food.\nEddy: \"Breakfast? I'm in!\" [He runs after Ed.]\nEdd: [bringing up the rear] \"Wait! Where are we going?\"\n\nEddy: \"Thataboy! Find me an omelette, Ed! And some bacon!\"\n\nEdd: [realizing they've gone off a cliff] \"Stop!\" [He grabs Eddy.]\nEddy: \"Ed!\" [Eddy grabs Ed, and all three fall to earth.]\nThe Eds: \"AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!\"\nSuddenly, the screaming stops. A seat from a Ferris wheel rises up, the Eds on it.]\nEddy: \"What happened?\"\n\nEdd: \"We seem to be on a Ferris wheel! Eddy!\"\n\nEd: [scared] \"Too high guys!\"\n\nEdd: \"Ed! Stay calm. No sudden movements now.\"\n\nEd: [leaping out] \"Down for Ed, Double D!\" [He starts to run on the cars, spinning the wheel around.]\nEdd: \"Ed! No!\"\nEd runs faster and faster, spinning the wheel at incredible speed. His foot catches on the seats in which his friends are sitting, and he gets in with them. Shortly thereafter, the Eds fly out of the car and hit a sign over the amusement park's entrance. The sign breaks off and falls. Edd heaves himself out from under it.\nEdd: \"Oh, now look what we've done! Goodness gracious, when will this day of malfunction and mishap\u2013\" [He realizes his friends haven't come out from under the board.] \"\u2013um\u2013end?\" [Eddy pulls himself out.]\nEddy: \"I'm really starting to hate slapstick.\" [Edd stares at the board in quiet contemplation.]\nEd: [holding up a half-eaten corn dog] \"Breakfast, guys. Finders keepers!\" [He gobbles it.]\nEddy: \"Glutton.\" [He walks over to Edd.]\nEdd: \"Mondo A-Go Go. Now why does that sound familiar?\"\n\nEddy: \"It don't. Ed! Find me one of those corn dogs, will ya? I could eat a horse.\" [Edd reaches into Eddy's pocket and searches through it. He pulls out Eddy's wallet.] \"Hey hey hey! Get your mitts off my wallet.\"\n\nEdd: [showing off the postcard] \"Eddy, look!\"\nThe postcard is a copy of the park's sign.\nEdd: \"Mondo A-Go Go! See how the billboard and the postcard your brother sent you match? He must have mailed it from this amusement park!\"\n\nEddy: [getting it] \"It does? He did?\" [grabbing his friends] \"He's here?\" [leaping into the air ecstatically] \"WE'RE HERE!\" [He races around the park, looking for his brother.] \"BIG BRO! WHERE ARE YOU, BUDDY? HEY!\"\n\nEdd: [helping him search] \"There's so many places he could be, Eddy!\"\n\nEd: \"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!\"\n\nEddy: \"BIG BRO! IT'S ME! EDDY!\" [to his friends] \"LOOKING KEEP LOOKING! HE'S GOTTA BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE!\" [from a telephone pole] \"BRO!\"\nWhile his friends frantically look for Eddy's brother, Ed stands up and slowly walks towards something he sees, as if he's in a trance. He stops, looking at it with a dazed look on his face.\nEddy: [noticing Ed] \"Hey, why don't you quit standing there and do something\u2013\"\n\nEd: \"WHALE!\" [He points to it.]\nEdd: \"A whale?\" [Ed is pointing at a whale-shaped trailer.] \"Eddy, didn't you say your brother was once a whaler?\"\n\nEddy: \"That's his place!\" [ecstatic] \"That's gotta be his house!\"\n\nEd: [running around] \"Eddy's big bro! I am Ed! See me?!?\" [He falls out of his pants.] \"I am okay.\"\n\nEdd: [looking through his ties] \"Opinion please, Ed. What do you think? Plaid? Stripes. Perhaps more conservative, yes?\" [He selects his usual tie.]\nEddy: \"Our problems are over, boys!\" [He strides towards the trailer.Jimmy is happily riding Wilfred. Suddenly, a crunch comes from behind him. Sarah has fallen off the pig.\nSarah: \"Darn it!\"\n\nJimmy: \"Sarah? Are you okay?\" [He falls off as well.] \"Oh, phooey.\"\n\nSarah: \"We fell off that stupid slippery pig all the way over here, Jimmy!\"\n\nJimmy: \"Wilfred can't help his oily complexion, Sarah!\" [Wilfred squeals.] \"Ooh! I think he wants us to follow him! Hurry!\"\n\nSarah: [muttering] \"Oh for Pete's sake.\"\nWilfred leads them down the road. They are but a few blocks from Mondo A-Go Go.[Eddy climbs the steps to the trailer.]\nEddy: \"Super sweet!\"\nEddy is about to knock when a hand grips his shoulder and yanks him away.\nLee: [hugging him] \"Your knights in shining armor have arrived!\"\n\nEdd: [shocked] \"May? Lee? Marie?\"\nMarie: \"We got your back, cutie-pie.\" [She empties the wagon of its cargo: Kevin, Nazz, and Rolf.]\nRolf: \"Double D Ed-boy?\"\n\nKevin: \"It's the dorks!\"\n\nEddy: [shocked] \"What are they doing here? What are you doing here?\"\nLee: \"Taking care of our boyfriends.\"\n\nMay: [to Ed] \"They were chasing you to beat you up!\"\n\nMarie: \"Yeah!\" [She pins Edd against the trailer.] \"No one beats up our little love muffins!\"\n\nEdd: [sweating profusely] \"Yes. I mean no. What? Yes?\"\nA pig squeals.\nRolf: \"Wilfred!\" [He sits up.] \"Is that you?\"\nWilfred arrives in a break between stands.\nSarah: [following him in] \"I swear if he eats one more corn dog off the ground, I'll\u2013\"\n\nMarie: \"Look! It's those twerps!\"\n\nEd: [joyous] \"Baby sister!\"\n\nSarah: [annoyed] \"Jeepers, Ed, you're still in one piece!\"\n\nJimmy: \"Did we miss the Eds beating?\"\n\nKevin: \"Nope!\" [He grabs Eddy's leg.] \"You're just in time.\"\n\nEddy: \"No! Wait!\" [He pauses and realizes he can step out of Kevin's grasp. After doing so, he turns to the crowd.] \"In your dreams, shovel-chin. Tell you what, why don't you\u2013\" [standing by the trailer] \"\u2013talk to my bro! He lives here, you know.\"\n\nNazz: [gagged] \"Hmm?\"\n\nKevin: \"No way.\"\n\nRolf: \"Could this be true?\"\n\nLee: \"Get in line, girls.\"\n\nEddy: \"Yeah. So tell him how you're gonna beat up his little bro.\"\nEddy knocks on the door. It creaks open a few inches, revealing that it is bolted numerous times.\nEddy's Brother: \"Park don't open till noon.\"\n\nEddy: [awestruck, to Edd] \"I told you he's a whiz at telling time!\"\n\nEddy's Brother: \"Pipsqueak?\"\n\nEddy: \"Bro!\" [moving Edd aside] \"Look out!\"\n\nEddy's Brother: \"Do Mom and Dad know you're here?\"\n\nEddy: \"As if!\"\n\nEddy's Brother: \"Anyone know you're here?\"\n\nEddy: \"Only these chumps who chased us here!\"\n\nEddy's Brother: \"Just a sec.\" [He unbolts the door and steps out.] \"Aren't those ankle-biters from the cul-de-sac?\"\n\nEddy: \"Yeah! And they wanna beat me up! All for nothin!\"\nEddy's Brother turns his tinted sunglasses towards the kids.\nKevin: \"He's lookin at you, Rolf. Later.\"\nKevin ducks behind him. Eddy's brother removes his shades.\nEddy's Brother: \"All for nothin, huh?\" [He picks up Eddy.] \"Still the troublemakin Eddy, I see.\" [He gives Eddy a noogie.\nEddy: [chuckling] \"Stop it, bro!\"\n\nEd: \"I smell my fingers after I eat cheese.\"\n\nEddy: \"Um, I told the guys you'd put us up.\" [gesturing to them] \"Ed\u2013and Double D.\"\n\nEdd: [starstruck, holding out his hand to shake] \"I guthink it's very wuh ah ooh...\" [He swoons.]\nEddy's Brother: [laughing] \"Why's your girlfriend wearing a sock on her head?\"\n\nEddy: [confused] \"Girlfriend?\"\n\nEddy's Brother: \"Yeah, sure. I'll help you out.\" [The Eds grin.]\nEddy: [awestruck] \"Really? Aw, bro, what'd I do without you!\" [He hugs his big brother tightly.] \"You are so my hero!\"\n\nEd: [hugging Edd] \"Happy place, Double D, happy place!\"\n\nJimmy: \"Isn't it touching, Sarah? It's like a fairy tale come true!\"\n\nKevin: [as the kids untie one another] \"Eddy and his two stooges got away with their lives, man. And we got burned again.\"\nEddy: [offscreen] \"Bro no!\"\n\nEddy's Brother: \"Just for old times' sake, let's play...Uncle.\"\nEddy: [unhappy] \"Uncle?\"\n\nEddy's Brother: [throwing Eddy down] \"Wanna crash at my place, don'tcha?\"\n\nEddy: \"That's why we came all the way\u2013Uncle! Uncle!\" [Eddy's brother is twisting his leg into a spiral.] \"Uncle!\"\n\nEddy's Brother: \"Say what?\"\nEddy: \"Uncle! Uncle! Uncle uncle!\"\n\nEdd: [gulping] \"Oh my.\"\nEddy's brother sets Eddy down and laughs as Eddy spins uncontrollably. When Eddy finishes, his big brother grabs him.\nEddy's Brother: \"That was good, Pipsqueak.\"\n\nEddy: \"So can we go inside now?\"\n\nEddy's Brother: [stroking his goatee] \"Why not?\" [sadistically] \"Don't forget to wipe your feet.\"\nEddy gets thrown against the door to the trailer. He bounces off, back to his brother, and the torture is repeated. This happens numerous times as the kids watch, shocked.\nNazz: \"Dude. Eddy's brother is a real jerk.\"\n\nLee: \"What's he doin to my man!\"\nLee's sisters have to hold her back to keep her from attacking Eddy's brother. By this time, each shot is thrown so hard that it nearly knocks the trailer over.\nEddy: [exhausted] \"Bro! Give it up!\"\n\nEddy's Brother: [sarcastically surprised] \"Give it up? I thought you wanted to hang with your hero.\" [He smiles sadistically.]\nEddy: \"I do, bro, I do!\"\n\nEdd: \"Mister Eddy's brother! As the older sibling, don't you think you should rather be setting an example for Eddy, and not\u2013um\u2013\" [Eddy's Brother smiles sinisterly.] \"\u2013belittle him\u2013in front of his\u2013friends?\"\n\nEddy's Brother: [as Eddy tries to get away] \"Belittle? He's always been little. I like you, girlfriend.\" [He slams Eddy down on Edd, smashing Edd into the ground.] \"You got spunk.\"\n\nEd and Marie: [shocked] \"Double D!\"\n\nSarah: \"What the heck?\"\n\nJimmy: [panicking] \"SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING!\"\n\nRolf: [puffing out his chest] \"Rolf has had enough of your platdoodle, elder one! Prepare yourself for a merciless thrashing!\" [He pushes Kevin in front. Kevin at first looks surprised but soon regains his confidence.\nKevin: \"Hey! Bro guy! Lay off him, man!\"\nAt this point, Eddy is clinging to the trailer door while his brother is trying to yank him back to be punished.\nNazz: \"Yeah, mister macho man!\"\nThe door is tearing off its hinges. Ed notices and has a sudden idea. He reaches over and pulls the pin from one of the hinges. The door breaks loose from this one, and is quickly followed with the other hinge giving way. The door flies towards Eddy's brother and smacks him squarely, knocking him over. Eddy hands on to the door as it flips and crashes. The kids back up as it lands in front of them. Eddy's brother stumbles around, dazed.\nEddy's Brother: \"Uuuuhhhh....unnnccclllleeee.\" [He collapses.]\nEdd: [rushing towards Eddy with Ed in tow] \"Eddy, speak to me!\" [reaching him] \"Are you all right?\"\n\nEddy: [pushing his hands away unhappily] \"I made it all up, Double D. Everything about my brother was a lie. I made things up so people would like me. Think I was cool. But boy was I wrong. The scam, my brother...this...when am I gonna learn, Double D?\" [Tears leak from his eyes.]\nEdd: \"I think you just have, Eddy.\" [Eddy grins, glad his friends still accept him.]\nKevin: \"Grab him!\"\nThe kids rumble towards the Eds.\nEd: \"No! Take me!\"\n\nEddy: [cowering] \"Okay! I'm sorry! Honest! I didn't mean to hurt you guys!\"\nThe kids grab Eddy and toss him in the air, catching him each time, and celebrating his victory.\nRolf: \"Let Rolf rub the pit of victory, Ed-boy!\" [He rubs Eddy's armpit.]\nNazz: \"I'm so glad you're okay, dude.\" [She hugs Eddy and gives him a big kiss.] \"You're awesome.\"\n\nEddy: \"I am?\"\n\nKevin: \"I gotta admit, pal, that was so choice.\"\n\nEddy: \"It was?\"\nEddy grins. As the kids and the Eds congregate, the Kanker sisters go over to Eddy's brother.\nLee: \"What a deadbeat this guy turned out to be.\"\n\nMarie: \"He don't look so tough.\"\nSuddenly, a bus honks as it pulls in. It parks by a truck, and the doors swing open. Jimmy cowers while everyone else looks at it, confused. A voice speaks from it, and the Eds start in fear.\nCaptain Melonhead: \"The time of reckoning is now, rapscallions!\"\nTwo masked figures leap from the bus and rush towards Eddy.\nCaptain Melonhead: \"It's Melon Time!\"\n\nEddy: \"WHERE'D HE COME FROM? Jonny! No! Wait!\"\nSplinter grabs the Eds and tosses them in the air. They land on top of one another, and Captain Melonhead leaps on top of the pile of Eds.\nCaptain Melonhead: \"No thanks are necessary, citizens.\" [He grins proudly.]\nSarah: \"You idiot! Leave our friends alone!\" [She attacks him.]\nKevin: \"Back off, melon dweeb!\" [He joins in the attack.]\nRolf: \"Leave some produce for Rolf!\" [He leaps into the fray. Jimmy helps the Eds up, and the fight concludes.]\nKevin: [wiping his hands] \"Sorry about that. Say, let's go to my place! Jawbreakers are on me!\"\nThe kids cheer, and the Eds grin.\nJimmy: \"Party at Kevin's, yay!\"\n\nEddy: \"We did it, Double D! Everyone loves us! We're finally in, baby!\"\n\nEdd: \"And it only took 130 episodes, 4 specials, and a movie, Eddy.\"\n\nEd: \"Let's sing a song!\"\n\nJimmy:\"When you stub your toe\nAnd it hurts you know\"\nEd, Edd, Eddy, Jimmy, Nazz, Sarah, Kevin & Rolf:\"Friends are there to help you\nWhen you step on your face\nAnd your teeth are misplaced\nFriends are there to help you\nWhen you're flying low\nAnd you're giving a show\nFriends are there to help you\nWhen you take off your shoe\nAnd your feet stink pee-yew\nFriends are there to help you.\"\nAs the kids sing the song, Wilfred eats out of Captain Melonhead's downed helmet. The Kankers are focused on something else entirely: dragging Eddy's brother inside.\nLee: \"First one inside gets to give him mouth to mouth!\"\nWhen the Kankers finish putting Eddy's brother inside, Marie reattaches the door, and shortly thereafter, a flurry of girlish giggling erupts. As the kids finish the song, the screen fades to black, and Edd uses his labeler one last time, in order to put a label reading \"The End\" on the screen.\nJimmy: \"Second verse, same as the first!\"\nThe credits roll as the kids sing.]Producers:\nDaniel Sioui\nRuth Vincent\nVoice Actors:\nMatt Hill (Ed)\nSamuel Vincent (Edd)\nTony Sampson (Eddy)\nKeenan Christenson (Jimmy)\nDavid Paul Grove (Jonny)\nJanyse Jaud (Sarah, Lee)\nKathleen Barr (Kevin, Marie)\nErin Fitzgerald (Nazz, May)\nPeter Kelamis (Rolf)\nTerry Klassen (Eddy's Brother)\n\nVoice Director:\nTerry Klassen\nEditor:\nKen Cathro\nArt Director:\nDanny Antonucci\nColor Design:\nBonni Reid\nBackground Design:\nRod Filbrandt\nHyuck Lee\nCharacter/Prop Design:\nCory Toomey\nHyuck Lee\nAdditional Storyboard Artists:\nSabrina Alberghetti\nSheranne Johnson\nSimon Piniel\nDesign Coordinator:\nVince Orcullo\nDesign Consultant:\nJilly Mentiply\nSound Coordinator:\nJoe Spivak\nInking:\nChristine Li\nProduction Coordinator:\nZoe Borroz\nSupervising Animation Director:\nMarlene Robinson May\nExposure Sheet Directors:\nRon Campbell\nSherann Johnson\nKaren Peterson\nMarlene Robinson May\nAnimation Production:\nYeson Entertainment\nAnimation Directors:\nKwang Jin Kim\nChul Ki Kwon\nLayout Supervisor:\nSuck Ho Shin\nAssistant to the Animation Director:\nTheresa Pukarnyk\nPost Production Supervisor:\nKen Cathro\nMusic Recording Engineer:\nShawn Pierce\nSound Effects Editors:\nJeff Davis\nDean Giammarco\nBill Sheppard\nDialogue Editors:\nJohnny Ludgate\nJeremy Duayne Elzinga\nAudio Assistant Editor:\nLuke Mathers\nSound Technician:\nPeter Eliuk\nAudio Technical Support:\nGordon Sproule\nRobert Hunter\nPost-Audio Coordination:\nAmy Giammarco\nStudio Audio Assistants:\nDavid Livingstone\nElla Pincknery\nSound Reader:\nBeans-N-Rice Editing\nVoice Production:\nVoiceBox Productions Inc.\nOn-Line Facility:\nStudio Post & Imaging Inc.\nVoice Editing:\nMX Solutions Inc.\nPost Audio Facility:\ndbc sound inc\nVancouver, Canada\nExecutive in Charge of Production for Cartoon Network:\nJay Bastian\nExecutive Producer:\nDanny Antonucci\n\n\u00a92009 Cartoon Network.

more\n'Cause we realize two things\nThat you aren't doing anything for us\nThan we can do better by ourselves\nSo from now on\nWe gonna use what we got to get what we want\nSo, oh\n[Verse 1: Lyn Collins]\nYou'd better think, think\nIt was the time when we had respect\nThat's the thing I never will forget\nNow, baby, I got a life to live\nAnd a whole lotta loving that I wanna give, yeah\nBut before I give it up, I gotta think, think\nWhat the future holds for me, it's too far ahead to see\nI don't need no heartache, I can't stand no misery\nLet me think, think\n\n[Bridge: Lyn Collins]\n(Yeah! Woo!)\nIt takes two to make a thing go right\nIt takes two to make it outta sight\nAlright, yeah\n\n[Verse 2: Lyn Collins]\nDon't say it's easy, know it can be rough\nJust plain living, sometimes it's kinda tough\n\n[Bridge: James Brown]\nYou bad, you bad\nShe bad, ain't she?\nYou bad, you bad\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Lyn Collins & James Brown]\nIf it's not in your vision\nDon't make no

true\nBut I won't do nothing that you won't do\nSaid, I won't do nothing that you won't do\nSo think about the good things\nCome on and think about the right things\nYou gotta think about me too\nCome

Men Of Pleasure; And How An Affecting Interview Took Place Between Mr. Weller And His Long-Lost Parent; Showing Also What Choice Spirits Assembled At The Magpie And Stump, And What A Capital Chapter The Next One Will Be\nIn the ground-floor front of a dingy house, at the very farthest end of Freeman's Court, Cornhill, sat the four clerks of Messrs. Dodson & Fogg, two of his Majesty's attorneys of the courts of King's Bench and Common Pleas at Westminster, and solicitors of the High Court of Chancery\u2014the aforesaid clerks catching as favourable glimpses of heaven's light and heaven's sun, in the course of their daily labours, as a man might hope to do, were he placed at the bottom of a reasonably deep well; and without the opportunity of perceiving the stars in the day-time, which the latter secluded situation affords.\nThe clerks' office of Messrs. Dodson & Fogg was a dark, mouldy, earthy-smelling room, with a high wainscotted partition to screen the clerks from the vulgar gaze, a couple of old wooden chairs, a very loud-ticking clock, an almanac, an umbrella-stand, a row of hat-pegs, and a few shelves, on which were deposited several ticketed bundles of dirty papers, some old deal boxes with paper labels, and sundry decayed stone ink bottles of various shapes and sizes. There was a glass door leading into the passage which formed the entrance to the court, and on the outer side of this glass door, Mr. Pickwick, closely followed by Sam Weller, presented himself on the Friday morning succeeding the occurrence of which a faithful narration is given in the last chapter.\n'Come in, can't you!' cried a voice from behind the partition, in reply to Mr. Pickwick's gentle tap at the door. And Mr. Pickwick and Sam entered accordingly.\n\n'Mr. Dodson or Mr. Fogg at home, sir?' inquired Mr. Pickwick, gently, advancing, hat in hand, towards the partition.\n'Mr. Dodson ain't at home, and Mr. Fogg's particularly engaged,' replied the voice; and at the same time the head to which the voice belonged, with a pen behind its ear, looked over the partition, and at Mr. Pickwick.\nIt was a ragged head, the sandy hair of which, scrupulously parted on one side, and flattened down with pomatum, was twisted into little semi-circular tails round a flat face ornamented with a pair of small eyes, and garnished with a very dirty shirt collar, and a rusty black stock.\n'Mr. Dodson ain't at home, and Mr. Fogg's particularly engaged,' said the man to whom the head belonged.\n'When will Mr. Dodson be back, sir?' inquired Mr. Pickwick. 'Can't say.'\n'Will it be long before Mr. Fogg is disengaged, Sir?'\n'Don't know.'\n\nHere the man proceeded to mend his pen with great deliberation, while another clerk, who was mixing a Seidlitz powder, under cover of the lid of his desk, laughed approvingly.\n\n'I think I'll wait,' said Mr. Pickwick. There was no reply; so Mr. Pickwick sat down unbidden, and listened to the loud ticking of the clock and the murmured conversation of the clerks.\n\n'That was a game, wasn't it?' said one of the gentlemen, in a brown coat and brass buttons, inky drabs, and bluchers, at the conclusion of some inaudible relation of his previous evening's adventures.\n\n'Devilish good\u2014devilish good,' said the Seidlitz-powder man. 'Tom Cummins was in the chair,' said the man with the brown coat. 'It was half-past four when I got to Somers Town, and then I was so uncommon lushy, that I couldn't find the place where the latch-key went in, and was obliged to knock up the old 'ooman. I say, I wonder what old Fogg 'ud say, if he knew it. I should get the sack, I s'pose\u2014eh?'\n\nAt this humorous notion, all the clerks laughed in concert.\n'There was such a game with Fogg here, this mornin',' said the man in the brown coat, 'while Jack was upstairs sorting the papers, and you two were gone to the stamp-office. Fogg was down here, opening the letters when that chap as we issued the writ against at Camberwell, you know, came in\u2014what's his name again?'\n'Ramsey,' said the clerk who had spoken to Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Ah, Ramsey\u2014a precious seedy-looking customer. \"Well, sir,\" says old Fogg, looking at him very fierce\u2014you know his way\u2014\"well, Sir, have you come to settle?\" \"Yes, I have, sir,\" said Ramsey, putting his hand in his pocket, and bringing out the money, \"the debt's two pound ten, and the costs three pound five, and here it is, Sir;\" and he sighed like bricks, as he lugged out the money, done up in a bit of blotting-paper. Old Fogg looked first at the money, and then at him, and then he coughed in his rum way, so that I knew something was coming. \"You don't know there's a declaration filed, which increases the costs materially, I suppose,\" said Fogg. \"You don't say that, sir,\" said Ramsey, starting back; \"the time was only out last night, Sir.\" \"I do say it, though,\" said Fogg, \"my clerk's just gone to file it. Hasn't Mr. Jackson gone to file that declaration in Bullman and Ramsey, Mr. Wicks?\" Of course I said yes, and then Fogg coughed again, and looked at Ramsey. \"My God!\" said Ramsey; \"and here have I nearly driven myself mad, scraping this money together, and all to no purpose.\" \"None at all,\" said Fogg coolly; \"so you had better go back and scrape some more together, and bring it here in time.\" \"I can't get it, by God!\" said Ramsey, striking the desk with his fist. \"Don't bully me, sir,\" said Fogg, getting into a passion on purpose. \"I am not bullying you, sir,\" said Ramsey. \"You are,\" said Fogg; \"get out, sir; get out of this office, Sir, and come back, Sir, when you know how to behave yourself.\" Well, Ramsey tried to speak, but Fogg wouldn't let him, so he put the money in his pocket, and sneaked out. The door was scarcely shut, when old Fogg turned round to me, with a sweet smile on his face, and drew the declaration out of his coat pocket. \"Here, Wicks,\" says Fogg, \"take a cab, and go down to the Temple as quick as you can, and file that. The costs are quite safe, for he's a steady man with a large family, at a salary of five-and-twenty shillings a week, and if he gives us a warrant of attorney, as he must in the end, I know his employers will see it paid; so we may as well get all we can get out of him, Mr. Wicks; it's a Christian act to do it, Mr. Wicks, for with his large family and small income, he'll be all the better for a good lesson against getting into debt\u2014won't he, Mr. Wicks, won't he?\"\u2014and he smiled so good-naturedly as he went away, that it was delightful to see him. He is a capital man of business,' said Wicks, in a tone of the deepest admiration, 'capital, isn't he?'\nThe other three cordially subscribed to this opinion, and the anecdote afforded the most unlimited satisfaction.\n\n'Nice men these here, Sir,' whispered Mr. Weller to his master; 'wery nice notion of fun they has, Sir.'\nMr. Pickwick nodded assent, and coughed to attract the attention of the young gentlemen behind the partition, who, having now relaxed their minds by a little conversation among themselves, condescended to take some notice of the stranger.\n'I wonder whether Fogg's disengaged now?' said Jackson.\n\n'I'll see,' said Wicks, dismounting leisurely from his stool. 'What name shall I tell Mr. Fogg?'\n'Pickwick,' replied the illustrious subject of these memoirs.\nMr. Jackson departed upstairs on his errand, and immediately returned with a message that Mr. Fogg would see Mr. Pickwick in five minutes; and having delivered it, returned again to his desk.\n\n'What did he say his name was?' whispered Wicks.\n'Pickwick,' replied Jackson; 'it's the defendant in Bardell and Pickwick.'\n\nA sudden scraping of feet, mingled with the sound of suppressed laughter, was heard from behind the partition.\n'They're a-twiggin' of you, Sir,' whispered Mr. Weller.\n'Twigging of me, Sam!' replied Mr. Pickwick; 'what do you mean by twigging me?'\n\nMr. Weller replied by pointing with his thumb over his shoulder, and Mr. Pickwick, on looking up, became sensible of the pleasing fact, that all the four clerks, with countenances expressive of the utmost amusement, and with their heads thrust over the wooden screen, were minutely inspecting the figure and general appearance of the supposed trifler with female hearts, and disturber of female happiness. On his looking up, the row of heads suddenly disappeared, and the sound of pens travelling at a furious rate over paper, immediately succeeded.\n\nA sudden ring at the bell which hung in the office, summoned Mr. Jackson to the apartment of Fogg, from whence he came back to say that he (Fogg) was ready to see Mr. Pickwick if he would step upstairs. Upstairs Mr. Pickwick did step accordingly, leaving Sam Weller below. The room door of the one-pair back, bore inscribed in legible characters the imposing words, 'Mr. Fogg'; and, having tapped thereat, and been desired to come in, Jackson ushered Mr. Pickwick into the presence.\n\n'Is Mr. Dodson in?' inquired Mr. Fogg.\n\n'Just come in, Sir,' replied Jackson.\n\n'Ask him to step here.'\n'Yes, sir.' Exit Jackson.\n\n'Take a seat, sir,' said Fogg; 'there is the paper, sir; my partner will be here directly, and we can converse about this matter, sir.'\n\nMr. Pickwick took a seat and the paper, but, instead of reading the latter, peeped over the top of it, and took a survey of the man of business, who was an elderly, pimply-faced, vegetable-diet sort of man, in a black coat, dark mixture trousers, and small black gaiters; a kind of being who seemed to be an essential part of the desk at which he was writing, and to have as much thought or feeling.\n\nAfter a few minutes' silence, Mr. Dodson, a plump, portly, stern-looking man, with a loud voice, appeared; and the conversation commenced.\n'This is Mr. Pickwick,' said Fogg.\n'Ah! You are the defendant, Sir, in Bardell and Pickwick?' said Dodson.\n'I am, sir,' replied Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Well, sir,' said Dodson, 'and what do you propose?'\n\n'Ah!' said Fogg, thrusting his hands into his trousers' pockets, and throwing himself back in his chair, 'what do you propose, Mr Pickwick?'\n\n'Hush, Fogg,' said Dodson, 'let me hear what Mr. Pickwick has to say.'\n\n'I came, gentlemen,' said Mr. Pickwick, gazing placidly on the two partners, 'I came here, gentlemen, to express the surprise with which I received your letter of the other day, and to inquire what grounds of action you can have against me.'\n'Grounds of\u2014' Fogg had ejaculated this much, when he was stopped by Dodson.\n\n'Mr. Fogg,' said Dodson, 'I am going to speak.' 'I beg your pardon, Mr. Dodson,' said Fogg.\n\n'For the grounds of action, sir,' continued Dodson, with moral elevation in his air, 'you will consult your own conscience and your own feelings. We, Sir, we, are guided entirely by the statement of our client. That statement, Sir, may be true, or it may be false; it may be credible, or it may be incredible; but, if it be true, and if it be credible, I do not hesitate to say, Sir, that our grounds of action, Sir, are strong, and not to be shaken. You may be an unfortunate man, Sir, or you may be a designing one; but if I were called upon, as a juryman upon my oath, Sir, to express an opinion of your conduct, Sir, I do not hesitate to assert that I should have but one opinion about it.' Here Dodson drew himself up, with an air of offended virtue, and looked at Fogg, who thrust his hands farther in his pockets, and nodding his head sagely, said, in a tone of the fullest concurrence, 'Most certainly.'\n\n'Well, Sir,' said Mr. Pickwick, with considerable pain depicted in his countenance, 'you will permit me to assure you that I am a most unfortunate man, so far as this case is concerned.'\n\n'I hope you are, Sir,' replied Dodson; 'I trust you may be, Sir. If you are really innocent of what is laid to your charge, you are more unfortunate than I had believed any man could possibly be. What do you say, Mr. Fogg?'\n'I say precisely what you say,' replied Fogg, with a smile of incredulity.\n\n'The writ, Sir, which commences the action,' continued Dodson, 'was issued regularly. Mr. Fogg, where is the PRAECIPE book?'\n'Here it is,' said Fogg, handing over a square book, with a parchment cover.\n\n'Here is the entry,' resumed Dodson. '\"Middlesex, Capias MARTHA BARDELL, WIDOW, v. SAMUEL PICKWICK. Damages #1500. Dodson & Fogg for the plaintiff, Aug. 28, 1827.\" All regular, Sir; perfectly.' Dodson coughed and looked at Fogg, who said 'Perfectly,' also. And then they both looked at Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'I am to understand, then,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'that it really is your intention to proceed with this action?'\n'Understand, sir!\u2014that you certainly may,' replied Dodson, with something as near a smile as his importance would allow.\n'And that the damages are actually laid at fifteen hundred pounds?' said Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'To which understanding you may add my assurance, that if we could have prevailed upon our client, they would have been laid at treble the amount, sir,' replied Dodson. 'I believe Mrs. Bardell specially said, however,' observed Fogg, glancing at Dodson, 'that she would not compromise for a farthing less.'\n\n'Unquestionably,' replied Dodson sternly. For the action was only just begun; and it wouldn't have done to let Mr. Pickwick compromise it then, even if he had been so disposed.\n\n'As you offer no terms, sir,' said Dodson, displaying a slip of parchment in his right hand, and affectionately pressing a paper copy of it, on Mr. Pickwick with his left, 'I had better serve you with a copy of this writ, sir. Here is the original, sir.'\n'Very well, gentlemen, very well,' said Mr. Pickwick, rising in person and wrath at the same time; 'you shall hear from my solicitor, gentlemen.'\n\n'We shall be very happy to do so,' said Fogg, rubbing his hands.\n\n'Very,' said Dodson, opening the door.\n'And before I go, gentlemen,' said the excited Mr. Pickwick, turning round on the landing, 'permit me to say, that of all the disgraceful and rascally proceedings\u2014'\n\n'Stay, sir, stay,' interposed Dodson, with great politeness. 'Mr. Jackson! Mr. Wicks!'\n'Sir,' said the two clerks, appearing at the bottom of the stairs.\n\n'I merely want you to hear what this gentleman says,' replied Dodson. 'Pray, go on, sir\u2014disgraceful and rascally proceedings, I think you said?'\n\n'I did,' said Mr. Pickwick, thoroughly roused. 'I said, Sir, that of all the disgraceful and rascally proceedings that ever were attempted, this is the most so. I repeat it, sir.'\n\n'You hear that, Mr. Wicks,' said Dodson.\n\n'You won't forget these expressions, Mr. Jackson?' said Fogg.\n'Perhaps you would like to call us swindlers, sir,' said Dodson. 'Pray do, Sir, if you feel disposed; now pray do, Sir.'\n'I do,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'You ARE swindlers.'\n\n'Very good,' said Dodson. 'You can hear down there, I hope, Mr. Wicks?'\n'Oh, yes, Sir,' said Wicks.\n\n'You had better come up a step or two higher, if you can't,' added Mr. Fogg. 'Go on, Sir; do go on. You had better call us thieves, Sir; or perhaps You would like to assault one Of US. Pray do it, Sir, if you would; we will not make the smallest resistance. Pray do it, Sir.'\n\nAs Fogg put himself very temptingly within the reach of Mr. Pickwick's clenched fist, there is little doubt that that gentleman would have complied with his earnest entreaty, but for the interposition of Sam, who, hearing the dispute, emerged from the office, mounted the stairs, and seized his master by the arm.\n\n'You just come away,' said Mr. Weller. 'Battledore and shuttlecock's a wery good game, vhen you ain't the shuttlecock and two lawyers the battledores, in which case it gets too excitin' to be pleasant. Come avay, Sir. If you want to ease your mind by blowing up somebody, come out into the court and blow up me; but it's rayther too expensive work to be carried on here.'\nAnd without the slightest ceremony, Mr. Weller hauled his master down the stairs, and down the court, and having safely deposited him in Cornhill, fell behind, prepared to follow whithersoever he should lead.\nMr. Pickwick walked on abstractedly, crossed opposite the Mansion House, and bent his steps up Cheapside. Sam began to wonder where they were going, when his master turned round, and said\u2014\n'Sam, I will go immediately to Mr. Perker's.'\n\n'That's just exactly the wery place vere you ought to have gone last night, Sir,' replied Mr. Weller.\n'I think it is, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'I KNOW it is,' said Mr. Weller.\n\n'Well, well, Sam,' replied Mr. Pickwick, 'we will go there at once; but first, as I have been rather ruffled, I should like a glass of brandy-and-water warm, Sam. Where can I have it, Sam?'\n\nMr. Weller's knowledge of London was extensive and peculiar. He replied, without the slightest consideration\u2014\n'Second court on the right hand side\u2014last house but vun on the same side the vay\u2014take the box as stands in the first fireplace, 'cos there ain't no leg in the middle o' the table, which all the others has, and it's wery inconvenient.'\nMr. Pickwick observed his valet's directions implicitly, and bidding Sam follow him, entered the tavern he had pointed out, where the hot brandy-and-water was speedily placed before him; while Mr. Weller, seated at a respectful distance, though at the same table with his master, was accommodated with a pint of porter.\n\nThe room was one of a very homely description, and was apparently under the especial patronage of stage-coachmen; for several gentleman, who had all the appearance of belonging to that learned profession, were drinking and smoking in the different boxes. Among the number was one stout, red-faced, elderly man, in particular, seated in an opposite box, who attracted Mr. Pickwick's attention. The stout man was smoking with great vehemence, but between every half-dozen puffs, he took his pipe from his mouth, and looked first at Mr. Weller and then at Mr. Pickwick. Then, he would bury in a quart pot, as much of his countenance as the dimensions of the quart pot admitted of its receiving, and take another look at Sam and Mr. Pickwick. Then he would take another half-dozen puffs with an air of profound meditation and look at them again. At last the stout man, putting up his legs on the seat, and leaning his back against the wall, began to puff at his pipe without leaving off at all, and to stare through the smoke at the new-comers, as if he had made up his mind to see the most he could of them.\n\nAt first the evolutions of the stout man had escaped Mr. Weller's observation, but by degrees, as he saw Mr. Pickwick's eyes every now and then turning towards him, he began to gaze in the same direction, at the same time shading his eyes with his hand, as if he partially recognised the object before him, and wished to make quite sure of its identity. His doubts were speedily dispelled, however; for the stout man having blown a thick cloud from his pipe, a hoarse voice, like some strange effort of ventriloquism, emerged from beneath the capacious shawls which muffled his throat and chest, and slowly uttered these sounds\u2014'Wy, Sammy!'\n\n'Who's that, Sam?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.\n'Why, I wouldn't ha' believed it, Sir,' replied Mr. Weller, with astonished eyes. 'It's the old 'un.'\n'Old one,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'What old one?'\n\n'My father, sir,' replied Mr. Weller. 'How are you, my ancient?' And with this beautiful ebullition of filial affection, Mr. Weller made room on the seat beside him, for the stout man, who advanced pipe in mouth and pot in hand, to greet him.\n'Wy, Sammy,' said the father, 'I ha'n't seen you, for two year and better.'\n'Nor more you have, old codger,' replied the son. 'How's mother-in-law?'\n\n'Wy, I'll tell you what, Sammy,' said Mr. Weller, senior, with much solemnity in his manner; 'there never was a nicer woman as a widder, than that 'ere second wentur o' mine\u2014a sweet creetur she was, Sammy; all I can say on her now, is, that as she was such an uncommon pleasant widder, it's a great pity she ever changed her condition. She don't act as a vife, Sammy.' 'Don't she, though?' inquired Mr. Weller, junior.\n\nThe elder Mr. Weller shook his head, as he replied with a sigh, 'I've done it once too often, Sammy; I've done it once too often. Take example by your father, my boy, and be wery careful o' widders all your life, 'specially if they've kept a public-house, Sammy.' Having delivered this parental advice with great pathos, Mr. Weller, senior, refilled his pipe from a tin box he carried in his pocket; and, lighting his fresh pipe from the ashes of the old One, commenced smoking at a great rate.\n'Beg your pardon, sir,' he said, renewing the subject, and addressing Mr. Pickwick, after a considerable pause, 'nothin' personal, I hope, sir; I hope you ha'n't got a widder, sir.'\n\n'Not I,' replied Mr. Pickwick, laughing; and while Mr. Pickwick laughed, Sam Weller informed his parent in a whisper, of the relation in which he stood towards that gentleman.\n\n'Beg your pardon, sir,' said Mr. Weller, senior, taking off his hat, 'I hope you've no fault to find with Sammy, Sir?'\n'None whatever,' said Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Wery glad to hear it, sir,' replied the old man; 'I took a good deal o' pains with his eddication, sir; let him run in the streets when he was wery young, and shift for hisself. It's the only way to make a boy sharp, sir.'\n'Rather a dangerous process, I should imagine,' said Mr. Pickwick, with a smile.\n\n'And not a wery sure one, neither,' added Mr. Weller; 'I got reg'larly done the other day.'\n'No!' said his father.\n\n'I did,' said the son; and he proceeded to relate, in as few words as possible, how he had fallen a ready dupe to the stratagems of Job Trotter.\nMr. Weller, senior, listened to the tale with the most profound attention, and, at its termination, said\u2014\n'Worn't one o' these chaps slim and tall, with long hair, and the gift o' the gab wery gallopin'?'\nMr. Pickwick did not quite understand the last item of description, but, comprehending the first, said 'Yes,' at a venture.\n'T' other's a black-haired chap in mulberry livery, with a wery large head?'\n\n'Yes, yes, he is,' said Mr. Pickwick and Sam, with great earnestness. 'Then I know where they are, and that's all about it,' said Mr. Weller; 'they're at Ipswich, safe enough, them two.'\n\n'No!' said Mr. Pickwick.\n'Fact,' said Mr. Weller, 'and I'll tell you how I know it. I work an Ipswich coach now and then for a friend o' mine. I worked down the wery day arter the night as you caught the rheumatic, and at the Black Boy at Chelmsford\u2014the wery place they'd come to\u2014I took 'em up, right through to Ipswich, where the man-servant\u2014him in the mulberries\u2014told me they was a-goin' to put up for a long time.'\n\n'I'll follow him,' said Mr. Pickwick; 'we may as well see Ipswich as any other place. I'll follow him.'\n'You're quite certain it was them, governor?' inquired Mr. Weller, junior.\n\n'Quite, Sammy, quite,' replied his father, 'for their appearance is wery sing'ler; besides that 'ere, I wondered to see the gen'l'm'n so formiliar with his servant; and, more than that, as they sat in the front, right behind the box, I heerd 'em laughing and saying how they'd done old Fireworks.'\n'Old who?' said Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Old Fireworks, Sir; by which, I've no doubt, they meant you, Sir.' There is nothing positively vile or atrocious in the appellation of 'old Fireworks,' but still it is by no means a respectful or flattering designation. The recollection of all the wrongs he had sustained at Jingle's hands, had crowded on Mr. Pickwick's mind, the moment Mr. Weller began to speak; it wanted but a feather to turn the scale, and 'old Fireworks' did it.\n\n'I'll follow him,' said Mr. Pickwick, with an emphatic blow on the table.\n'I shall work down to Ipswich the day arter to-morrow, Sir,' said Mr. Weller the elder, 'from the Bull in Whitechapel; and if you really mean to go, you'd better go with me.'\n\n'So we had,' said Mr. Pickwick; 'very true; I can write to Bury, and tell them to meet me at Ipswich. We will go with you. But don't hurry away, Mr. Weller; won't you take anything?'\n\n'You're wery good, Sir,' replied Mr. W., stopping short;\u2014'perhaps a small glass of brandy to drink your health, and success to Sammy, Sir, wouldn't be amiss.'\n\n'Certainly not,' replied Mr. Pickwick. 'A glass of brandy here!' The brandy was brought; and Mr. Weller, after pulling his hair to Mr. Pickwick, and nodding to Sam, jerked it down his capacious throat as if it had been a small thimbleful. 'Well done, father,' said Sam, 'take care, old fellow, or you'll have a touch of your old complaint, the gout.'\n\n'I've found a sov'rin' cure for that, Sammy,' said Mr. Weller, setting down the glass.\n\n'A sovereign cure for the gout,' said Mr. Pickwick, hastily producing his note-book\u2014'what is it?'\n\n'The gout, Sir,' replied Mr. Weller, 'the gout is a complaint as arises from too much ease and comfort. If ever you're attacked with the gout, sir, jist you marry a widder as has got a good loud woice, with a decent notion of usin' it, and you'll never have the gout agin. It's a capital prescription, sir. I takes it reg'lar, and I can warrant it to drive away any illness as is caused by too much jollity.' Having imparted this valuable secret, Mr. Weller drained his glass once more, produced a laboured wink, sighed deeply, and slowly retired.\n\n'Well, what do you think of what your father says, Sam?' inquired Mr. Pickwick, with a smile.\n'Think, Sir!' replied Mr. Weller; 'why, I think he's the wictim o' connubiality, as Blue Beard's domestic chaplain said, vith a tear of pity, ven he buried him.'\n\nThere was no replying to this very apposite conclusion, and, therefore, Mr. Pickwick, after settling the reckoning, resumed his walk to Gray's Inn. By the time he reached its secluded groves, however, eight o'clock had struck, and the unbroken stream of gentlemen in muddy high-lows, soiled white hats, and rusty apparel, who were pouring towards the different avenues of egress, warned him that the majority of the offices had closed for that day.\n\nAfter climbing two pairs of steep and dirty stairs, he found his anticipations were realised. Mr. Perker's 'outer door' was closed; and the dead silence which followed Mr. Weller's repeated kicks thereat, announced that the officials had retired from business for the night.\n\n'This is pleasant, Sam,' said Mr. Pickwick; 'I shouldn't lose an hour in seeing him; I shall not be able to get one wink of sleep to-night, I know, unless I have the satisfaction of reflecting that I have confided this matter to a professional man.'\n'Here's an old 'ooman comin' upstairs, sir,' replied Mr. Weller; 'p'raps she knows where we can find somebody. Hollo, old lady, vere's Mr. Perker's people?'\n\n'Mr. Perker's people,' said a thin, miserable-looking old woman, stopping to recover breath after the ascent of the staircase\u2014'Mr. Perker's people's gone, and I'm a-goin' to do the office out.' 'Are you Mr. Perker's servant?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.\n'I am Mr. Perker's laundress,' replied the woman.\n\n'Ah,' said Mr. Pickwick, half aside to Sam, 'it's a curious circumstance, Sam, that they call the old women in these inns, laundresses. I wonder what's that for?'\n\n''Cos they has a mortal awersion to washing anythin', I suppose, Sir,' replied Mr. Weller.\n'I shouldn't wonder,' said Mr. Pickwick, looking at the old woman, whose appearance, as well as the condition of the office, which she had by this time opened, indicated a rooted antipathy to the application of soap and water; 'do you know where I can find Mr. Perker, my good woman?'\n\n'No, I don't,' replied the old woman gruffly; 'he's out o' town now.'\n'That's unfortunate,' said Mr. Pickwick; 'where's his clerk? Do you know?'\n'Yes, I know where he is, but he won't thank me for telling you,' replied the laundress.\n'I have very particular business with him,' said Mr. Pickwick. 'Won't it do in the morning?' said the woman.\n'Not so well,' replied Mr. Pickwick.\n\n'Well,' said the old woman, 'if it was anything very particular, I was to say where he was, so I suppose there's no harm in telling. If you just go to the Magpie and Stump, and ask at the bar for Mr. Lowten, they'll show you in to him, and he's Mr. Perker's clerk.'\n\nWith this direction, and having been furthermore informed that the hostelry in question was situated in a court, happy in the double advantage of being in the vicinity of Clare Market, and closely approximating to the back of New Inn, Mr. Pickwick and Sam descended the rickety staircase in safety, and issued forth in quest of the Magpie and Stump.\nThis favoured tavern, sacred to the evening orgies of Mr. Lowten and his companions, was what ordinary people would designate a public-house. That the landlord was a man of money-making turn was sufficiently testified by the fact of a small bulkhead beneath the tap-room window, in size and shape not unlike a sedan-chair, being underlet to a mender of shoes: and that he was a being of a philanthropic mind was evident from the protection he afforded to a pieman, who vended his delicacies without fear of interruption, on the very door-step. In the lower windows, which were decorated with curtains of a saffron hue, dangled two or three printed cards, bearing reference to Devonshire cider and Dantzic spruce, while a large blackboard, announcing in white letters to an enlightened public, that there were 500,000 barrels of double stout in the cellars of the establishment, left the mind in a state of not unpleasing doubt and uncertainty as to the precise direction in the bowels of the earth, in which this mighty cavern might be supposed to extend. When we add that the weather-beaten signboard bore the half-obliterated semblance of a magpie intently eyeing a crooked streak of brown paint, which the neighbours had been taught from infancy to consider as the 'stump,' we have said all that need be said of the exterior of the edifice.\n\nOn Mr. Pickwick's presenting himself at the bar, an elderly female emerged from behind the screen therein, and presented herself before him.\n\n'Is Mr. Lowten here, ma'am?' inquired Mr. Pickwick.\n'Yes, he is, Sir,' replied the landlady. 'Here, Charley, show the gentleman in to Mr. Lowten.'\n'The gen'l'm'n can't go in just now,' said a shambling pot-boy, with a red head, 'cos' Mr. Lowten's a-singin' a comic song, and he'll put him out. He'll be done directly, Sir.'\n\nThe red-headed pot-boy had scarcely finished speaking, when a most unanimous hammering of tables, and jingling of glasses, announced that the song had that instant terminated; and Mr. Pickwick, after desiring Sam to solace himself in the tap, suffered himself to be conducted into the presence of Mr. Lowten.\n\nAt the announcement of 'A gentleman to speak to you, Sir,' a puffy-faced young man, who filled the chair at the head of the table, looked with some surprise in the direction from whence the voice proceeded; and the surprise seemed to be by no means diminished, when his eyes rested on an individual whom he had never seen before.\n'I beg your pardon, Sir,' said Mr. Pickwick, 'and I am very sorry to disturb the other gentlemen, too, but I come on very particular business; and if you will suffer me to detain you at this end of the room for five minutes, I shall be very much obliged to you.'\n\nThe puffy-faced young man rose, and drawing a chair close to Mr. Pickwick in an obscure corner of the room, listened attentively to his tale of woe.\n\n'Ah,'he said, when Mr. Pickwick had concluded, 'Dodson and Fogg\u2014sharp practice theirs\u2014capital men of business, Dodson and Fogg, sir.'\n\nMr. Pickwick admitted the sharp practice of Dodson and Fogg, and Lowten resumed. 'Perker ain't in town, and he won't be, neither, before the end of next week; but if you want the action defended, and will leave the copy with me, I can do all that's needful till he comes back.'\n\n'That's exactly what I came here for,' said Mr. Pickwick, handing over the document. 'If anything particular occurs, you can write to me at the post-office, Ipswich.'\n\n'That's all right,' replied Mr. Perker's clerk; and then seeing Mr. Pickwick's eye wandering curiously towards the table, he added, 'will you join us, for half an hour or so? We are capital company here to-night. There's Samkin and Green's managing-clerk, and Smithers and Price's chancery, and Pimkin and Thomas's out o' doors\u2014sings a capital song, he does\u2014and Jack Bamber, and ever so many more. You're come out of the country, I suppose. Would you like to join us?'\nMr. Pickwick could not resist so tempting an opportunity of studying human nature. He suffered himself to be led to the table, where, after having been introduced to the company in due form, he was accommodated with a seat near the chairman and called for a glass of his favourite beverage.\n\nA profound silence, quite contrary to Mr. Pickwick's expectation, succeeded. 'You don't find this sort of thing disagreeable, I hope, sir?' said his right hand neighbour, a gentleman in a checked shirt and Mosaic studs, with a cigar in his mouth.\n'Not in the least,' replied Mr. Pickwick; 'I like it very much, although I am no smoker myself.'\n'I should be very sorry to say I wasn't,' interposed another gentleman on the opposite side of the table. 'It's board and lodgings to me, is smoke.'\n\nMr. Pickwick glanced at the speaker, and thought that if it were washing too, it would be all the better.\nHere there was another pause. Mr. Pickwick was a stranger, and his coming had evidently cast a damp upon the party.\n'Mr. Grundy's going to oblige the company with a song,' said the chairman.\n\n'No, he ain't,' said Mr. Grundy.\n'Why not?' said the chairman.\n\n'Because he can't,' said Mr. Grundy. 'You had better say he won't,' replied the chairman.\n'Well, then, he won't,' retorted Mr. Grundy. Mr. Grundy's positive refusal to gratify the company occasioned another silence. 'Won't anybody enliven us?' said the chairman, despondingly.\n\n'Why don't you enliven us yourself, Mr. Chairman?' said a young man with a whisker, a squint, and an open shirt collar (dirty), from the bottom of the table.\n\n'Hear! hear!' said the smoking gentleman, in the Mosaic jewellery.\n'Because I only know one song, and I have sung it already, and it's a fine of \"glasses round\" to sing the same song twice in a night,' replied the chairman.\n\nThis was an unanswerable reply, and silence prevailed again.\n'I have been to-night, gentlemen,' said Mr. Pickwick, hoping to start a subject which all the company could take a part in discussing, 'I have been to-night, in a place which you all know very well, doubtless, but which I have not been in for some years, and know very little of; I mean Gray's Inn, gentlemen. Curious little nooks in a great place, like London, these old inns are.'\n\n'By Jove!' said the chairman, whispering across the table to Mr. Pickwick, 'you have hit upon something that one of us, at least, would talk upon for ever. You'll draw old Jack Bamber out; he was never heard to talk about anything else but the inns, and he has lived alone in them till he's half crazy.'\n\nThe individual to whom Lowten alluded, was a little, yellow, high-shouldered man, whose countenance, from his habit of stooping forward when silent, Mr. Pickwick had not observed before. He wondered, though, when the old man raised his shrivelled face, and bent his gray eye upon him, with a keen inquiring look, that such remarkable features could have escaped his attention for a moment. There was a fixed grim smile perpetually on his countenance; he leaned his chin on a long, skinny hand, with nails of extraordinary length; and as he inclined his head to one side, and looked keenly out from beneath his ragged gray eyebrows, there was a strange, wild slyness in his leer, quite repulsive to behold.\n\nThis was the figure that now started forward, and burst into an animated torrent of words. As this chapter has been a long one, however, and as the old man was a remarkable personage, it will be more respectful to him, and more convenient to us, to let him speak for himself in a fresh one.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1733745", "artist_names": "Yes", "full_title": "America by\u00a0Yes", "header_image_thumbnail_url":

It s fleece was white as snow. And everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go. \" - THOMAS EDISON\n(reciting a familiar nursery rhyme. He invented the phonograph, the light bulb, the motion picture projector, the stock market ticker, the alkaline storage battery and hundreds of other things.)\n\n\"The Distinguished Flying Cross upon Colonel Charles A. Lindberg\"\n\n(He made the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean on May 20, 1927. He took off from Roosevelt Field on Long Island, New York and landed near Paris, France. The flight took thirty three and a half hours. Of course, he had to be awake the entire time, and alert enough to pilot a plane.)\n\"Today, paniced investors ordered their brokers to sell at whatever the price in the stock market crashed.\"\n(In October, 1929, an over-valued stock market, with many owning shares purchased \"on margin\" or with borrowed money, crashed. Numerous men committed suicide rather than face bankruptcy. In response, the U.S. Government imposed stringent rules on the buying and selling of stocks. These make it less likely that a similar catastrophic devaluation could occur now. The insurance companies began to exclude suicide as an acceptable cause of death for life insurance policies and/or wrote in a two year waiting period before benefits could be paid.)\n\n\"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" - PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT\n(From his first Inaugural Address, 3/4/33. In the depths of the Great Depression, the pessimism of the population and especially the business community kept things bad. Decisions based on a gloomy outlook caused things to get even worse. In that respect, the mood and expectation of bad times became a self-fulfilling prophecy.)\n\"Horrific place, ladies and gentlemen, the smoke and the flames now, ooh, the humanity\"\n(Live radio account of the fire and crash of the German airship \"Hindenburg.\" It happened 5/6/37 on the eve of the Second World War in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The Hindenburg was the largest airship ever built. It was filled with an enormous quantity of hydrogen. Hydrogen had two big advantages over helium. It had greater lifting potential and was much cheaper. Unfortunately, it is one of the most flammable substances in the world. Helium could be used to put fires out. Since that disaster all airships have been filled with hydrogen. This luxurious craft had just come from Europe, making the trip across the Atlantic Ocean much faster than any ship. It was the pride of Nazi Germany. It s loss was a blow to the morale of the German engineers. The German public never heard much about it. The exact cause of the fire and crash has never been determined.)\n\n\"Now, with the help and support of the woman I love.\" - KING EDWARD VIII (of England)\n(Speech on 12/11/36, after he had announced that he was abdicating the throne of England to marry Bessie Wallis Warfield Simpson Spencer, an American socialite)\n\n\"Urging the people to evacuate the city as Martians approach.\"\n\n\"Never to go to war with one another again\"\n\n\". . .Juden. . .\"\n\nADOLPH HITLER (speaking in German, referring to the Jews)\n\"This country is at war with Germany.\"\nPRESIDENT WOODROW WILSON (address to Congress 4/2/17, bringing the United States into World War I)\n\n\"December 7, 1941, (the Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor) a date which will live in infamy.\"\nFRANKLIN D.

Numerous conspiracy theories have evolved because of this lack of information. When you see notorious criminals going to and from jail, with armed guards, wearing body armor themselves, this is where it started. As much as many would like to see these animals die, protecting them until the judicial process is completed is common practice.)\n\n\"I have a dream (Really?) that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.\" - MARTIN LUTHER KING\n(At the Civil Rights March of March 20, 1967 in Washington D.C.)\n\n\"And I say segregation now\" - GEORGE WALLACE\n(Governor of Alabama 1963-1967)\n\n\"What we have foremost in common is their enemy.\" - MALCOLM X\n(In the early 1960 s a \"Black militant\" who believed in complete separation of the races)\n\n\"segregation tomorrow\" - GEORGE WALLACE\n\n\"the white man\" - MALCOLM X\n\nAnd segregation forever\" - GEORGE WALLACE\n\nHe s an enemy to all of us.\" - MALCOLM X\n\n\"I have a dream\" - MARTIN LUTHER KING\n\n\"I am about to sign into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" - PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON\n(He became President following the assassination of President John Kennedy. Civil rights was a major goal for Kennedy, but he would not likely have had the same success that Johnson did. Johnson was able to pass this legislation becuase he was from the South (Texas). He had been Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate and knew how to get things through Congress. In addition, he apparently would do whatever was necessary to get what he wanted.)\n\n\"The Beatles!\" \"And today I ordered to Vietnam the Air Mobile Division.

That ball is gonna be, out of here. It s gone. It s 715. There s a new home run champion of all time and it s Henry Aaron.\"\n(There was substantial sentiment against Aaron because he was Black.

For the young, inexperienced, not-to-bright Quayle to refer to the revered former President so casually as \"Jack\" was not appropriate. Comparing himself to Kennedy was beyond laughable.)\n\"Mr. Gorbachov, tear down this wall.\" - PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN\n\n(to Soviet Prime Minister Michael Gorbachov, referring to the Berlin Wall.

show\n\nThe young New Mexican puppeteer\nHe saw the people all lived in fear\nHe thought that maybe they'd listen to\nA puppet telling them what to do\nAnd now he got some string and he got some wood\nHe did some carving and he was good\nAnd folks came running so they could hear\nThe young New Mexican puppeteer\nFirst he carved out young Abe Lincoln\nAbe will teach 'em civil rights\nThen a King named Martin Luther\nSo they'd recall his peaceful fight\n\nOld Mark Twain, his wit and wisdom\nWill surely show them life is fun\nBut he smiled with satisfaction\nWhen the Prince of Peace was done\n\nThe young New Mexican puppeteer\nHe saw the people all lived in fear\nHe thought that maybe they'd listen to\nA puppet telling them what to do\nAnd now he got some string and he got some

across the message\nTo walk along life's open path\n\nThey built him his own puppet theatre\nDecked out with spotlights yellow and red\nAnd then they wrote him up in all the papers\nAnd this is what

Gentlemen\nFellow Americans\nLady Americans\nThis is James Brown\nI wanna talk to you about one of our\nMost deadly\nKillers in the country today\nI had a dream the other night, and I\nWas sitting in my living room\nDozed off to sleep\nSo I start to dreaming\nI dreamed I walked in a place and\nI saw a real strange, weird object\nStanding up talking to the people\nAnd I found out it was heroin\nThat deadly drug that go in your veins\nHe said:\nI came to this country without a passport\nEver since then I've been hunted and sought\nMy little white grains are nothing but waste\nSoft and deadly and bitter to taste\nI'm a world of power and all know it's true\nUse me once and you'll know it, too\nI can make a mere schoolboy forget his books\nI can make a world-famous beauty neglect her looks\nI can make a good man forsake his wife\nSend a greedy man to prison for the rest of his life\nI can make a man forsake his country and flag\nMake a girl sell her body for a five-dollar bag\nSome think my adventure's a joy and a thrill\nBut I'll put a gun in your hand and make you kill\nIn cellophane bags I've found my way\nTo heads of state and children at play\nI'm financed in China, ran in Japan\nI'm respected in Turkey and I'm legal in Siam\nI take my addicts and make 'em steal, borrow, beg\nThen they search for a vein in their arm or their leg\nSo, be you Italian, Jewish, Black or Mex\nI can make the most virile of men forget their sex\nSo now, now my man, you must do your best\nTo keep up your habit until your arrest\nNow the police have taken you from under my wing\nDo you think they dare defy me, I who am king?\nNow, you must lie in that county jail\nWhere I can't get to you by visit or mail\nSo squirm - with discomfort - wiggle and cough\nSix days of madness, hah, and you might throw me off\nCurse me in name, defy me in speech\nBut you'd pick me up right now if I were in your reach\nAll through your sentence you've become resolved to your fate\nHear now, young man and woman, I'll be waiting at the gate\nDon't be afraid, don't run, I'm not chased\nSure my name is Heroin, you'll be back for a taste\nBehold, you're hooked\nYour foot is in the stirrup\nAnd make -- haste\nMount the steed and ride him well\nFor the white horse of heroin will ride you to Hell\nTo Hell\nWill ride you to Hell\nUntil you are dead\nDead, brother, Dead\nThis is a revolution of the mind\nGet your mind together\nAnd get away from drugs\nThat's the man\nBack, backYou might also like1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/3253",

"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Taylor-branch"}, "artist": "Taylor Branch", "lyrics": "The Shame of College Sports Lyrics\u201cI\u2019M NOT HIDING,\u201d Sonny Vaccaro told a closed hearing at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., in 2001. \u201cWe want to put our materials on the bodies of your athletes, and the best way to do that is buy your school. Or buy your coach.\u201d\n\nVaccaro\u2019s audience, the members of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, bristled. These were eminent reformers\u2014among them the president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, two former heads of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and several university presidents and chancellors. The Knight Foundation, a nonprofit that takes an interest in college athletics as part of its concern with civic life, had tasked them with saving college sports from runaway commercialism as embodied by the likes of Vaccaro, who, since signing his pioneering shoe contract with Michael Jordan in 1984, had built sponsorship empires successively at Nike, Adidas, and Reebok. Not all the members could hide their scorn for the \u201csneaker pimp\u201d of schoolyard hustle, who boasted of writing checks for millions to everybody in higher education.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d asked Bryce Jordan, the president emeritus of Penn State, \u201cshould a university be an advertising medium for your industry?\u201d\n\nVaccaro did not blink. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t, sir,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou sold your souls, and you\u2019re going to continue selling them. You can be very moral and righteous in asking me that question, sir,\u201d Vaccaro added with irrepressible good cheer, \u201cbut there\u2019s not one of you in this room that\u2019s going to turn down any of our money. You\u2019re going to take it. I can only offer it.\u201d\n\nWilliam Friday, a former president of North Carolina\u2019s university system, still winces at the memory. \u201cBoy, the silence that fell in that room,\u201d he recalled recently. \u201cI never will forget it.\u201d Friday, who founded and co-chaired two of the three Knight Foundation sports initiatives over the past 20 years, called Vaccaro \u201cthe worst of all\u201d the witnesses ever to come before the panel.\n\nBut what Vaccaro said in 2001 was true then, and it\u2019s true now: corporations offer money so they can profit from the glory of college athletes, and the universities grab it. In 2010, despite the faltering economy, a single college athletic league, the football-crazed Southeastern Conference (SEC), became the first to crack the billion-dollar barrier in athletic receipts. The Big Ten pursued closely at $905 million. That money comes from a combination of ticket sales, concession sales, merchandise, licensing fees, and other sources\u2014but the great bulk of it comes from television contracts.\nEducators are in thrall to their athletic departments because of these television riches and because they respect the political furies that can burst from a locker room. \u201cThere\u2019s fear,\u201d Friday told me when I visited him on the University of North Carolina campus in Chapel Hill last fall. As we spoke, two giant construction cranes towered nearby over the university\u2019s Kenan Stadium, working on the latest $77 million renovation. (The University of Michigan spent almost four times that much to expand its Big House.) Friday insisted that for the networks, paying huge sums to universities was a bargain. \u201cWe do every little thing for them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe furnish the theater, the actors, the lights, the music, and the audience for a drama measured neatly in time slots. They bring the camera and turn it on.\u201d Friday, a weathered idealist at 91, laments the control universities have ceded in pursuit of this money. If television wants to broadcast football from here on a Thursday night, he said, \u201cwe shut down the university at 3 o\u2019clock to accommodate the crowds.\u201d He longed for a campus identity more centered in an academic mission.\n\nThe United States is the only country in the world that hosts big-time sports at institutions of higher learning. This should not, in and of itself, be controversial. College athletics are rooted in the classical ideal of mens sane in corpore sano\u2014a sound mind in a sound body\u2014and who would argue with that? College sports are deeply inscribed in the culture of our nation. Half a million young men and women play competitive intercollegiate sports each year. Millions of spectators flock into football stadiums each Saturday in the fall, and tens of millions more watch on television. The March Madness basketball tournament each spring has become a major national event, with upwards of 80 million watching it on television and talking about the games around the office water cooler. ESPN has spawned ESPNU, a channel dedicated to college sports, and Fox Sports and other cable outlets are developing channels exclusively to cover sports from specific regions or divisions.\nWith so many people paying for tickets and watching on television, college sports has become Very Big Business. According to various reports, the football teams at Texas, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, and Penn State\u2014to name just a few big-revenue football schools\u2014each earn between $40 million and $80 million in profits a year, even after paying coaches multimillion-dollar salaries. When you combine so much money with such high, almost tribal, stakes\u2014football boosters are famously rabid in their zeal to have their alma mater win\u2014corruption is likely to follow.\n\nScandal after scandal has rocked college sports. In 2010, the NCAA sanctioned the University of Southern California after determining that star running back Reggie Bush and his family had received \u201cimproper benefits\u201d while he played for the Trojans. (Among other charges, Bush and members of his family were alleged to have received free airfare and limousine rides, a car, and a rent-free home in San Diego, from sports agents who wanted Bush as a client.) The Bowl Championship Series stripped USC of its 2004 national title, and Bush returned the Heisman Trophy he had won in 2005. Last fall, as Auburn University football stormed its way to an undefeated season and a national championship, the team\u2019s star quarterback, Cam Newton, was dogged by allegations that his father had used a recruiter to solicit up to $180,000 from Mississippi State in exchange for his son\u2019s matriculation there after junior college in 2010. Jim Tressel, the highly successful head football coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes, resigned last spring after the NCAA alleged he had feigned ignorance of rules violations by players on his team. At least 28 players over the course of the previous nine seasons, according to Sports Illustrated, had traded autographs, jerseys, and other team memorabilia in exchange for tattoos or cash at a tattoo parlor in Columbus, in violation of NCAA rules. Late this summer, Yahoo Sports reported that the NCAA was investigating allegations that a University of Miami booster had given millions of dollars in illicit cash and services to more than 70 Hurricanes football players over eight years.\n\nThe list of scandals goes on. With each revelation, there is much wringing of hands. Critics scold schools for breaking faith with their educational mission, and for failing to enforce the sanctity of \u201camateurism.\u201d Sportswriters denounce the NCAA for both tyranny and impotence in its quest to \u201cclean up\u201d college sports. Observers on all sides express jumbled emotions about youth and innocence, venting against professional mores or greedy amateurs.\nFor all the outrage, the real scandal is not that students are getting illegally paid or recruited, it\u2019s that two of the noble principles on which the NCAA justifies its existence\u2014\u201camateurism\u201d and the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d\u2014are cynical hoaxes, legalistic confections propagated by the universities so they can exploit the skills and fame of young athletes. The tragedy at the heart of college sports is not that some college athletes are getting paid, but that more of them are not.\n\n\nDon Curtis, a UNC trustee, told me that impoverished football players cannot afford movie tickets or bus fare home. Curtis is a rarity among those in higher education today, in that he dares to violate the signal taboo: \u201cI think we should pay these guys something.\u201d\nFans and educators alike recoil from this proposal as though from original sin. Amateurism is the whole point, they say. Paid athletes would destroy the integrity and appeal of college sports. Many former college athletes object that money would have spoiled the sanctity of the bond they enjoyed with their teammates. I, too, once shuddered instinctively at the notion of paid college athletes.\n\nBut after an inquiry that took me into locker rooms and ivory towers across the country, I have come to believe that sentiment blinds us to what\u2019s before our eyes. Big-time college sports are fully commercialized. Billions of dollars flow through them each year. The NCAA makes money, and enables universities and corporations to make money, from the unpaid labor of young athletes.\nSlavery analogies should be used carefully. College athletes are not slaves. Yet to survey the scene\u2014corporations and universities enriching themselves on the backs of uncompensated young men, whose status as \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d deprives them of the right to due process guaranteed by the Constitution\u2014is to catch an unmistakable whiff of the plantation. Perhaps a more apt metaphor is colonialism: college sports, as overseen by the NCAA, is a system imposed by well-meaning paternalists and rationalized with hoary sentiments about caring for the well-being of the colonized. But it is, nonetheless, unjust. The NCAA, in its zealous defense of bogus principles, sometimes destroys the dreams of innocent young athletes.\n\nThe NCAA today is in many ways a classic cartel. Efforts to reform it\u2014most notably by the three Knight Commissions over the course of 20 years\u2014have, while making changes around the edges, been largely fruitless. The time has come for a major overhaul. And whether the powers that be like it or not, big changes are coming. Threats loom on multiple fronts: in Congress, the courts, breakaway athletic conferences, student rebellion, and public disgust. Swaddled in gauzy clich\u00e9s, the NCAA presides over a vast, teetering glory.\nFounding Myths\nFrom the start, amateurism in college sports has been honored more often in principle than in fact; the NCAA was built of a mixture of noble and venal impulses. In the late 19th century, intellectuals believed that the sporting arena simulated an impending age of Darwinian struggle. Because the United States did not hold a global empire like England\u2019s, leaders warned of national softness once railroads conquered the last continental frontier. As though heeding this warning, ingenious students turned variations on rugby into a toughening agent. Today a plaque in New Brunswick, New Jersey, commemorates the first college game, on November 6, 1869, when Rutgers beat Princeton 6\u20134.\nWalter Camp graduated from Yale in 1880 so intoxicated by the sport that he devoted his life to it without pay, becoming \u201cthe father of American football.\u201d He persuaded other schools to reduce the chaos on the field by trimming each side from 15 players to 11, and it was his idea to paint measuring lines on the field. He conceived functional designations for players, coining terms such as quarterback. His game remained violent by design. Crawlers could push the ball forward beneath piles of flying elbows without pause until they cried \u201cDown!\u201d in submission.\n\nIn an 1892 game against its archrival, Yale, the Harvard football team was the first to deploy a \u201cflying wedge,\u201d based on Napoleon\u2019s surprise concentrations of military force. In an editorial calling for the abolition of the play, The New York Times described it as \u201chalf a ton of bone and muscle coming into collision with a man weighing 160 or 170 pounds,\u201d noting that surgeons often had to be called onto the field. Three years later, the continuing mayhem prompted the Harvard faculty to take the first of two votes to abolish football. Charles Eliot, the university\u2019s president, brought up other concerns. \u201cDeaths and injuries are not the strongest argument against football,\u201d declared Eliot. \u201cThat cheating and brutality are profitable is the main evil.\u201d Still, Harvard football persisted. In 1903, fervent alumni built Harvard Stadium with zero college funds. The team\u2019s first paid head coach, Bill Reid, started in 1905 at nearly twice the average salary for a full professor.\n\nA newspaper story from that year, illustrated with the Grim Reaper laughing on a goalpost, counted 25 college players killed during football season. A fairy-tale version of the founding of the NCAA holds that President Theodore Roosevelt, upset by a photograph of a bloodied Swarthmore College player, vowed to civilize or destroy football. The real story is that Roosevelt maneuvered shrewdly to preserve the sport\u2014and give a boost to his beloved Harvard. After McClure\u2019s magazine published a story on corrupt teams with phantom students, a muckraker exposed Walter Camp\u2019s $100,000 slush fund at Yale. In response to mounting outrage, Roosevelt summoned leaders from Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to the White House, where Camp parried mounting criticism and conceded nothing irresponsible in the college football rules he\u2019d established. At Roosevelt\u2019s behest, the three schools issued a public statement that college sports must reform to survive, and representatives from 68 colleges founded a new organization that would soon be called the National Collegiate Athletic Association. A Haverford College official was confirmed as secretary but then promptly resigned in favor of Bill Reid, the new Harvard coach, who instituted new rules that benefited Harvard\u2019s playing style at the expense of Yale\u2019s. At a stroke, Roosevelt saved football and dethroned Yale.\n\nFor nearly 50 years, the NCAA, with no real authority and no staff to speak of, enshrined amateur ideals that it was helpless to enforce. (Not until 1939 did it gain the power even to mandate helmets.) In 1929, the Carnegie Foundation made headlines with a report, \u201cAmerican College Athletics,\u201d which concluded that the scramble for players had \u201creached the proportions of nationwide commerce.\u201d Of the 112 schools surveyed, 81 flouted NCAA recommendations with inducements to students ranging from open payrolls and disguised booster funds to no-show jobs at movie studios. Fans ignored the uproar, and two-thirds of the colleges mentioned told The New York Times that they planned no changes. In 1939, freshman players at the University of Pittsburgh went on strike because they were getting paid less than their upperclassman teammates.\n\nEmbarrassed, the NCAA in 1948 enacted a \u201cSanity Code,\u201d which was supposed to prohibit all concealed and indirect benefits for college athletes; any money for athletes was to be limited to transparent scholarships awarded solely on financial need. Schools that violated this code would be expelled from NCAA membership and thus exiled from competitive sports.\n\nThis bold effort flopped. Colleges balked at imposing such a drastic penalty on each other, and the Sanity Code was repealed within a few years. The University of Virginia went so far as to call a press conference to say that if its athletes were ever accused of being paid, they should be forgiven, because their studies at Thomas Jefferson\u2019s university were so rigorous.\n\nThe Big Bluff\nIn 1951, the NCAA seized upon a serendipitous set of events to gain control of intercollegiate sports. First, the organization hired a young college dropout named Walter Byers as executive director. A journalist who was not yet 30 years old, he was an appropriately inauspicious choice for the vaguely defined new post. He wore cowboy boots and a toupee. He shunned personal contact, obsessed over details, and proved himself a bureaucratic master of pervasive, anonymous intimidation. Although discharged from the Army during World War II for defective vision, Byers was able to see an opportunity in two contemporaneous scandals. In one, the tiny College of William and Mary, aspiring to challenge football powers Oklahoma and Ohio State, was found to be counterfeiting grades to keep conspicuously pampered players eligible. In the other, a basketball point-shaving conspiracy (in which gamblers paid players to perform poorly) had spread from five New York colleges to the University of Kentucky, the reigning national champion, generating tabloid \u201cperp\u201d photos of gangsters and handcuffed basketball players. The scandals posed a crisis of credibility for collegiate athletics, and nothing in the NCAA\u2019s feeble record would have led anyone to expect real reform.\n\nBut Byers managed to impanel a small infractions board to set penalties without waiting for a full convention of NCAA schools, which would have been inclined toward forgiveness. Then he lobbied a University of Kentucky dean\u2014A. D. Kirwan, a former football coach and future university president\u2014not to contest the NCAA\u2019s dubious legal position (the association had no actual authority to penalize the university), pleading that college sports must do something to restore public support. His gambit succeeded when Kirwan reluctantly accepted a landmark precedent: the Kentucky basketball team would be suspended for the entire 1952\u201353 season. Its legendary coach, Adolph Rupp, fumed for a year in limbo.\n\nThe Kentucky case created an aura of centralized command for an NCAA office that barely existed. At the same time, a colossal misperception gave Byers leverage to mine gold. Amazingly in retrospect, most colleges and marketing experts considered the advent of television a dire threat to sports. Studies found that broadcasts reduced live attendance, and therefore gate receipts, because some customers preferred to watch at home for free. Nobody could yet imagine the revenue bonanza that television represented. With clunky new TV sets proliferating, the 1951 NCAA convention voted 161\u20137 to outlaw televised games except for a specific few licensed by the NCAA staff.\n\nAll but two schools quickly complied. The University of Pennsylvania and Notre Dame protested the order to break contracts for home-game television broadcasts, claiming the right to make their own decisions. Byers objected that such exceptions would invite disaster. The conflict escalated. Byers brandished penalties for games televised without approval. Penn contemplated seeking antitrust protection through the courts. Byers issued a contamination notice, informing any opponent scheduled to play Penn that it would be punished for showing up to compete. In effect, Byers mobilized the college world to isolate the two holdouts in what one sportswriter later called \u201cthe Big Bluff.\u201d\n\nByers won. Penn folded in part because its president, the perennial White House contender Harold Stassen, wanted to mend relations with fellow schools in the emerging Ivy League, which would be formalized in 1954. When Notre Dame also surrendered, Byers conducted exclusive negotiations with the new television networks on behalf of every college team. Joe Rauh Jr., a prominent civil-rights attorney, helped him devise a rationing system to permit only 11 broadcasts a year\u2014the fabled Game of the Week. Byers and Rauh selected a few teams for television exposure, excluding the rest. On June 6, 1952, NBC signed a one-year deal to pay the NCAA $1.14 million for a carefully restricted football package. Byers routed all contractual proceeds through his office. He floated the idea that, to fund an NCAA infrastructure, his organization should take a 60 percent cut; he accepted 12 percent that season. (For later contracts, as the size of television revenues grew exponentially, he backed down to 5 percent.) Proceeds from the first NBC contract were enough to rent an NCAA headquarters, in Kansas City.\n\nOnly one year into his job, Byers had secured enough power and money to regulate all of college sports. Over the next decade, the NCAA\u2019s power grew along with television revenues. Through the efforts of Byers\u2019s deputy and chief lobbyist, Chuck Neinas, the NCAA won an important concession in the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, in which Congress made its granting of a precious antitrust exemption to the National Football League contingent upon the blackout of professional football on Saturdays. Deftly, without even mentioning the NCAA, a rider on the bill carved each weekend into protected broadcast markets: Saturday for college, Sunday for the NFL. The NFL got its antitrust exemption. Byers, having negotiated the NCAA\u2019s television package up to $3.1 million per football season\u2014which was higher than the NFL\u2019s figure in those early years\u2014had made the NCAA into a spectacularly profitable cartel.\n\n\u201cWe Eat What We Kill\u201d\nThe NCAA\u2019s control of college sports still rested on a fragile base, however: the consent of the colleges and universities it governed. For a time, the vast sums of television money delivered to these institutions through Byers\u2019s deals made them willing to submit. But the big football powers grumbled about the portion of the television revenue diverted to nearly a thousand NCAA member schools that lacked major athletic programs. They chafed against cost-cutting measures\u2014such as restrictions on team size\u2014designed to help smaller schools. \u201cI don\u2019t want Hofstra telling Texas how to play football,\u201d Darrell Royal, the Longhorns coach, griped. By the 1970s and \u201980s, as college football games delivered bonanza ratings\u2014and advertising revenue\u2014to the networks, some of the big football schools began to wonder: Why do we need to have our television coverage brokered through the NCAA? Couldn\u2019t we get a bigger cut of that TV money by dealing directly with the networks?\nByers faced a rude internal revolt. The NCAA\u2019s strongest legions, its big football schools, defected en masse. Calling the NCAA a price-fixing cartel that siphoned every television dollar through its coffers, in 1981 a rogue consortium of 61 major football schools threatened to sign an independent contract with NBC for $180 million over four years.\n\nWith a huge chunk of the NCAA\u2019s treasury walking out the door, Byers threatened sanctions, as he had against Penn and Notre Dame three decades earlier. But this time the universities of Georgia and Oklahoma responded with an antitrust suit. \u201cIt is virtually impossible to overstate the degree of our resentment \u2026 of the NCAA,\u201d said William Banowsky, the president of the University of Oklahoma. In the landmark 1984 NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma decision, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the NCAA\u2019s latest football contracts with television\u2014and any future ones\u2014as an illegal restraint of trade that harmed colleges and viewers. Overnight, the NCAA\u2019s control of the television market for football vanished. Upholding Banowsky\u2019s challenge to the NCAA\u2019s authority, the Regents decision freed the football schools to sell any and all games the markets would bear. Coaches and administrators no longer had to share the revenue generated by their athletes with smaller schools outside the football consortium. \u201cWe eat what we kill,\u201d one official at the University of Texas bragged.\n\nA few years earlier, this blow might have financially crippled the NCAA\u2014but a rising tide of money from basketball concealed the structural damage of the Regents decision. During the 1980s, income from the March Madness college basketball tournament, paid directly by the television networks to the NCAA, grew tenfold. The windfall covered\u2014and then far exceeded\u2014what the organization had lost from football.\n\nStill, Byers never forgave his former deputy Chuck Neinas for leading the rebel consortium. He knew that Neinas had seen from the inside how tenuous the NCAA\u2019s control really was, and how diligently Byers had worked to prop up its Oz-like fa\u00e7ade. During Byers\u2019s tenure, the rule book for Division I athletes grew to 427 pages of scholastic detail. His NCAA personnel manual banned conversations around water coolers, and coffee cups on desks, while specifying exactly when drapes must be drawn at the NCAA\u2019s 27,000-square-foot headquarters near Kansas City (built in 1973 from the proceeds of a 1 percent surtax on football contracts). It was as though, having lost control where it mattered, Byers pedantically exerted more control where it didn\u2019t.\n\nAfter retiring in 1987, Byers let slip his suppressed fury that the ingrate football conferences, having robbed the NCAA of television revenue, still expected it to enforce amateurism rules and police every leak of funds to college players. A lethal greed was \u201cgnawing at the innards of college athletics,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. When Byers renounced the NCAA\u2019s pretense of amateurism, his former colleagues would stare blankly, as though he had gone senile or, as he wrote, \u201cdesecrated my sacred vows.\u201d But Byers was better positioned than anyone else to argue that college football\u2019s claim to amateurism was unfounded. Years later, as we will see, lawyers would seize upon his words to do battle with the NCAA.\n\nMeanwhile, reformers fretted that commercialism was hurting college sports, and that higher education\u2019s historical balance between academics and athletics had been distorted by all the money sloshing around. News stories revealed that schools went to extraordinary measures to keep academically incompetent athletes eligible for competition, and would vie for the most-sought-after high-school players by proffering under-the-table payments. In 1991, the first Knight Commission report, \u201cKeeping Faith With the Student Athlete,\u201d was published; the commission\u2019s \u201cbedrock conviction\u201d was that university presidents must seize control of the NCAA from athletic directors in order to restore the preeminence of academic values over athletic or commercial ones. In response, college presidents did take over the NCAA\u2019s governance. But by 2001, when the second Knight Commission report (\u201cA Call to Action: Reconnecting College Sports and Higher Education\u201d) was issued, a new generation of reformers was admitting that problems of corruption and commercialism had \u201cgrown rather than diminished\u201d since the first report. Meanwhile the NCAA itself, revenues rising, had moved into a $50 million, 116,000-square-foot headquarters in Indianapolis. By 2010, as the size of NCAA headquarters increased yet again with a 130,000-square-foot expansion, a third Knight Commission was groping blindly for a hold on independent college-athletic conferences that were behaving more like sovereign pro leagues than confederations of universities. And still more money continued to flow into NCAA coffers. With the basketball tournament\u2019s 2011 television deal, annual March Madness broadcast revenues had skyrocketed 50-fold in less than 30 years.\n\nThe Myth of the \u201cStudent-Athlete\u201d\nToday, much of the NCAA\u2019s moral authority\u2014indeed much of the justification for its existence\u2014is vested in its claim to protect what it calls the \u201cstudent-athlete.\u201d The term is meant to conjure the nobility of amateurism, and the precedence of scholarship over athletic endeavor. But the origins of the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d lie not in a disinterested ideal but in a sophistic formulation designed, as the sports economist Andrew Zimbalist has written, to help the NCAA in its \u201cfight against workmen\u2019s compensation insurance claims for injured football players.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe crafted the term student-athlete,\u201d Walter Byers himself wrote, \u201cand soon it was embedded in all NCAA rules and interpretations.\u201d The term came into play in the 1950s, when the widow of Ray Dennison, who had died from a head injury received while playing football in Colorado for the Fort Lewis A&M Aggies, filed for workmen\u2019s-compensation death benefits. Did his football scholarship make the fatal collision a \u201cwork-related\u201d accident? Was he a school employee, like his peers who worked part-time as teaching assistants and bookstore cashiers? Or was he a fluke victim of extracurricular pursuits? Given the hundreds of incapacitating injuries to college athletes each year, the answers to these questions had enormous consequences. The Colorado Supreme Court ultimately agreed with the school\u2019s contention that he was not eligible for benefits, since the college was \u201cnot in the football business.\u201d\n\nThe term student-athlete was deliberately ambiguous. College players were not students at play (which might understate their athletic obligations), nor were they just athletes in college (which might imply they were professionals). That they were high-performance athletes meant they could be forgiven for not meeting the academic standards of their peers; that they were students meant they did not have to be compensated, ever, for anything more than the cost of their studies. Student-athlete became the NCAA\u2019s signature term, repeated constantly in and out of courtrooms.\n\nUsing the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d defense, colleges have compiled a string of victories in liability cases. On the afternoon of October 26, 1974, the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs were playing the Alabama Crimson Tide in Birmingham, Alabama. Kent Waldrep, a TCU running back, carried the ball on a \u201cRed Right 28\u201d sweep toward the Crimson Tide\u2019s sideline, where he was met by a swarm of tacklers. When Waldrep regained consciousness, Bear Bryant, the storied Crimson Tide coach, was standing over his hospital bed. \u201cIt was like talking to God, if you\u2019re a young football player,\u201d Waldrep recalled.\n\nWaldrep was paralyzed: he had lost all movement and feeling below his neck. After nine months of paying his medical bills, Texas Christian refused to pay any more, so the Waldrep family coped for years on dwindling charity.\n\nThrough the 1990s, from his wheelchair, Waldrep pressed a lawsuit for workers\u2019 compensation. (He also, through heroic rehabilitation efforts, recovered feeling in his arms, and eventually learned to drive a specially rigged van. \u201cI can brush my teeth,\u201d he told me last year, \u201cbut I still need help to bathe and dress.\u201d) His attorneys haggled with TCU and the state worker-compensation fund over what constituted employment. Clearly, TCU had provided football players with equipment for the job, as a typical employer would\u2014but did the university pay wages, withhold income taxes on his financial aid, or control work conditions and performance? The appeals court finally rejected Waldrep\u2019s claim in June of 2000, ruling that he was not an employee because he had not paid taxes on financial aid that he could have kept even if he quit football. (Waldrep told me school officials \u201csaid they recruited me as a student, not an athlete,\u201d which he says was absurd.)\n\nThe long saga vindicated the power of the NCAA\u2019s \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d formulation as a shield, and the organization continues to invoke it as both a legalistic defense and a noble ideal. Indeed, such is the term\u2019s rhetorical power that it is increasingly used as a sort of reflexive mantra against charges of rabid hypocrisy.\n\nLast Thanksgiving weekend, with both the FBI and the NCAA investigating whether Cam Newton had been lured onto his team with illegal payments, Newton\u2019s Auburn Tigers and the Alabama Crimson Tide came together for their annual game, known as the Iron Bowl, before 101,821 fans at Bryant-Denny Stadium. This game is always a highlight of the football season because of the historic rivalry between the two schools, and the 2010 edition had enormous significance, pitting the defending national champion Crimson Tide against the undefeated Tigers, who were aiming for their first championship since 1957. I expected excited fans; what I encountered was the throbbing heart of college sports. As I drove before daybreak toward the stadium, a sleepless caller babbled over WJOX, the local fan radio station, that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t stop thinking about the coin toss.\u201d In the parking lot, ticketless fans were puzzled that anyone need ask why they had tailgated for days just to watch their satellite-fed flat screens within earshot of the roar. All that morning, pilgrims packed the Bear Bryant museum, where displays elaborated the misery of Alabama\u2019s 4\u201324 run before the glorious Bryant era dawned in 1958.\n\nFinally, as Auburn took the field for warm-ups, one of Alabama\u2019s public-address-system operators played \u201cTake the Money and Run\u201d (an act for which he would be fired). A sea of signs reading $CAM taunted Newton. The game, perhaps the most exciting of the season, was unbearably tense, with Auburn coming from way behind to win 28\u201327, all but assuring that it would go on to play for the national championship. Days later, Auburn suspended Newton after the NCAA found that a rules violation had occurred: his father was alleged to have marketed his son in a pay-for-play scheme; a day after that, the NCAA reinstated Newton\u2019s eligibility because investigators had not found evidence that Newton or Auburn officials had known of his father\u2019s actions. This left Newton conveniently eligible for the Southeastern Conference championship game and for the postseason BCS championship bowl. For the NCAA, prudence meant honoring public demand.\n\n\u201cOur championships,\u201d NCAA President Mark Emmert has declared, \u201care one of the primary tools we have to enhance the student-athlete experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoremasters\u201d\nNCAA v. Regents left the NCAA devoid of television football revenue and almost wholly dependent on March Madness basketball. It is rich but insecure. Last year, CBS Sports and Turner Broadcasting paid $771 million to the NCAA for television rights to the 2011 men\u2019s basketball tournament alone. That\u2019s three-quarters of a billion dollars built on the backs of amateurs\u2014on unpaid labor. The whole edifice depends on the players\u2019 willingness to perform what is effectively volunteer work. The athletes, and the league officials, are acutely aware of this extraordinary arrangement. William Friday, the former North Carolina president, recalls being yanked from one Knight Commission meeting and sworn to secrecy about what might happen if a certain team made the NCAA championship basketball game. \u201cThey were going to dress and go out on the floor,\u201d Friday told me, \u201cbut refuse to play,\u201d in a wildcat student strike. Skeptics doubted such a diabolical plot. These were college kids\u2014unlikely to second-guess their coaches, let alone forfeit the dream of a championship. Still, it was unnerving to contemplate what hung on the consent of a few young volunteers: several hundred million dollars in television revenue, countless livelihoods, the NCAA budget, and subsidies for sports at more than 1,000 schools. Friday\u2019s informants exhaled when the suspect team lost before the finals.\n\nCognizant of its precarious financial base, the NCAA has in recent years begun to pursue new sources of revenue. Taking its cue from member schools such as Ohio State (which in 2009 bundled all its promotional rights\u2014souvenirs, stadium ads, shoe deals\u2014and outsourced them to the international sports marketer IMG College for a guaranteed $11 million a year), the NCAA began to exploit its vault of college sports on film. For $29.99 apiece, NCAA On Demand offers DVDs of more than 200 memorable contests in men\u2019s ice hockey alone. Video-game technology also allows nostalgic fans to relive and even participate in classic moments of NCAA Basketball. NCAA Football, licensed by the NCAA through IMG College to Electronic Arts, one of the world\u2019s largest video-game manufacturers, reportedly sold 2.5 million copies in 2008. Brit Kirwan, the chancellor of the Maryland university system and a former president at Ohio State, says there were \u201cterrible fights\u201d between the third Knight Commission and the NCAA over the ethics of generating this revenue.\n\nAll of this money ultimately derives from the college athletes whose likenesses are shown in the films or video games. But none of the profits go to them. Last year, Electronic Arts paid more than $35 million in royalties to the NFL players union for the underlying value of names and images in its pro football series\u2014but neither the NCAA nor its affiliated companies paid former college players a nickel. Naturally, as they have become more of a profit center for the NCAA, some of the vaunted \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d have begun to clamor that they deserve a share of those profits. You \u201csee everybody getting richer and richer,\u201d Desmond Howard, who won the 1991 Heisman Trophy while playing for the Michigan Wolverines, told USA Today recently. \u201cAnd you walk around and you can\u2019t put gas in your car? You can\u2019t even fly home to see your parents?\u201d\n\nSome athletes have gone beyond talk. A series of lawsuits quietly making their way through the courts cast a harsh light on the absurdity of the system\u2014and threaten to dislodge the foundations on which the NCAA rests. On July 21, 2009, lawyers for Ed O\u2019Bannon filed a class-action antitrust suit against the NCAA at the U.S. District Court in San Francisco. \u201cOnce you leave your university,\u201d says O\u2019Bannon, who won the John Wooden Award for player of the year in 1995 on UCLA\u2019s national-championship basketball team, \u201cone would think your likeness belongs to you.\u201d The NCAA and UCLA continue to collect money from the sales of videos of him playing. But by NCAA rules, O\u2019Bannon, who today works at a Toyota dealership near Las Vegas, alleges he is still not allowed to share the revenue the NCAA generates from his own image as a college athlete. His suit quickly gathered co-plaintiffs from basketball and football, ex-players featured in NCAA videos and other products. \u201cThe NCAA does not license student-athlete likenesses,\u201d NCAA spokesperson Erik Christianson told The New York Times in response to the suit, \u201cor prevent former student-athletes from attempting to do so. Likewise, to claim the NCAA profits off student-athlete likenesses is also pure fiction.\u201d\n\nThe legal contention centers on Part IV of the NCAA\u2019s \u201cStudent-Athlete Statement\u201d for Division I, which requires every athlete to authorize use of \u201cyour name or picture \u2026 to promote NCAA championships or other NCAA events, activities or programs.\u201d Does this clause mean that athletes clearly renounce personal interest forever? If so, does it actually undermine the NCAA by implicitly recognizing that athletes have a property right in their own performance? Jon King, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, expects the NCAA\u2019s core mission of amateurism to be its \u201clast defense standing.\u201d\n\nIn theory, the NCAA\u2019s passion to protect the noble amateurism of college athletes should prompt it to focus on head coaches in the high-revenue sports\u2014basketball and football\u2014since holding the top official accountable should most efficiently discourage corruption. The problem is that the coaches\u2019 growing power has rendered them, unlike their players, ever more immune to oversight. According to research by Charles Clotfelter, an economist at Duke, the average compensation for head football coaches at public universities, now more than $2 million, has grown 750 percent (adjusted for inflation) since the Regents decision in 1984; that\u2019s more than 20 times the cumulative 32 percent raise for college professors. For top basketball coaches, annual contracts now exceed $4 million, augmented by assorted bonuses, endorsements, country-club memberships, the occasional private plane, and in some cases a negotiated percentage of ticket receipts. (Oregon\u2019s ticket concessions netted former football coach Mike Bellotti an additional $631,000 in 2005.)\n\nThe NCAA rarely tangles with such people, who are apt to fight back and win. When Rick Neuheisel, the head football coach of the Washington Huskies, was punished for petty gambling (in a March Madness pool, as it happened), he sued the NCAA and the university for wrongful termination, collected $4.5 million, and later moved on to UCLA. When the NCAA tried to cap assistant coaches\u2019 entering salary at a mere $16,000, nearly 2,000 of them brought an antitrust suit, Law v. NCAA, and in 1999 settled for $54.5 million. Since then, salaries for assistant coaches have commonly exceeded $200,000, with the top assistants in the SEC averaging $700,000. In 2009, Monte Kiffin, then at the University of Tennessee, became the first assistant coach to reach $1 million, plus benefits.\n\nThe late Myles Brand, who led the NCAA from 2003 to 2009, defended the economics of college sports by claiming that they were simply the result of a smoothly functioning free market. He and his colleagues deflected criticism about the money saturating big-time college sports by focusing attention on scapegoats; in 2010, outrage targeted sports agents. Last year Sports Illustrated published \u201cConfessions of an Agent,\u201d a firsthand account of dealing with high-strung future pros whom the agent and his peers courted with flattery, cash, and tawdry favors. Nick Saban, Alabama\u2019s head football coach, mobilized his peers to denounce agents as a public scourge. \u201cI hate to say this,\u201d he said, \u201cbut how are they any better than a pimp? I have no respect for people who do that to young people. None.\u201d\n\nSaban\u2019s raw condescension contrasts sharply with the lonely penitence from Dale Brown, the retired longtime basketball coach at LSU. \u201cLook at the money we make off predominantly poor black kids,\u201d Brown once reflected. \u201cWe\u2019re the whoremasters.\u201d\n\n\u201cPicayune Rules\u201d\nNCAA officials have tried to assert their dominion\u2014and distract attention from the larger issues\u2014by chasing frantically after petty violations. Tom McMillen, a former member of the Knight Commission who was an All-American basketball player at the University of Maryland, likens these officials to traffic cops in a speed trap, who could flag down almost any passing motorist for prosecution in kangaroo court under a \u201cmaze of picayune rules.\u201d The publicized cases have become convoluted soap operas. At the start of the 2010 football season, A. J. Green, a wide receiver at Georgia, confessed that he\u2019d sold his own jersey from the Independence Bowl the year before, to raise cash for a spring-break vacation. The NCAA sentenced Green to a four-game suspension for violating his amateur status with the illicit profit generated by selling the shirt off his own back. While he served the suspension, the Georgia Bulldogs store continued legally selling replicas of Green\u2019s No. 8 jersey for $39.95 and up.\n\nA few months later, the NCAA investigated rumors that Ohio State football players had benefited from \u201chook-ups on tatts\u201d\u2014that is, that they\u2019d gotten free or underpriced tattoos at an Ohio tattoo parlor in exchange for autographs and memorabilia\u2014a violation of the NCAA\u2019s rule against discounts linked to athletic personae. The NCAA Committee on Infractions imposed five-game suspensions on Terrelle Pryor, Ohio State\u2019s tattooed quarterback, and four other players (some of whom had been found to have sold their Big Ten championship rings and other gear), but did permit them to finish the season and play in the Sugar Bowl. (This summer, in an attempt to satisfy NCAA investigators, Ohio State voluntarily vacated its football wins from last season, as well as its Sugar Bowl victory.) A different NCAA committee promulgated a rule banning symbols and messages in players\u2019 eyeblack\u2014reportedly aimed at Pryor\u2019s controversial gesture of support for the pro quarterback Michael Vick, and at Bible verses inscribed in the eyeblack of the former Florida quarterback Tim Tebow.\n\nThe moral logic is hard to fathom: the NCAA bans personal messages on the bodies of the players, and penalizes players for trading their celebrity status for discounted tattoos\u2014but it codifies precisely how and where commercial insignia from multinational corporations can be displayed on college players, for the financial benefit of the colleges. Last season, while the NCAA investigated him and his father for the recruiting fees they\u2019d allegedly sought, Cam Newton compliantly wore at least 15 corporate logos\u2014one on his jersey, four on his helmet visor, one on each wristband, one on his pants, six on his shoes, and one on the headband he wears under his helmet\u2014as part of Auburn\u2019s $10.6 million deal with Under Armour.\n\n\u201cRestitution\u201d\nObscure NCAA rules have bedeviled Scott Boras, the preeminent sports agent for Major League Baseball stars, in cases that may ultimately prove more threatening to the NCAA than Ed O\u2019Bannon\u2019s antitrust suit. In 2008, Andrew Oliver, a sophomore pitcher for the Oklahoma State Cowboys, had been listed as the 12th-best professional prospect among sophomore players nationally. He decided to dismiss the two attorneys who had represented him out of high school, Robert and Tim Baratta, and retain Boras instead. Infuriated, the Barattas sent a spiteful letter to the NCAA. Oliver didn\u2019t learn about this until the night before he was scheduled to pitch in the regional final for a place in the College World Series, when an NCAA investigator showed up to question him in the presence of lawyers for Oklahoma State. The investigator also questioned his father, Dave, a truck driver.\n\nHad Tim Baratta been present in their home when the Minnesota Twins offered $390,000 for Oliver to sign out of high school? A yes would mean trouble. While the NCAA did not forbid all professional advice\u2014indeed, Baseball America used to publish the names of agents representing draft-likely underclassmen\u2014NCAA Bylaw 12.3.2.1 prohibited actual negotiation with any professional team by an adviser, on pain of disqualification for the college athlete. The questioning lasted past midnight.\n\nJust hours before the game was to start the next day, Oklahoma State officials summoned Oliver to tell him he would not be pitching. Only later did he learn that the university feared that by letting him play while the NCAA adjudicated his case, the university would open not only the baseball team but all other Oklahoma State teams to broad punishment under the NCAA\u2019s \u201crestitution rule\u201d (Bylaw 19.7), under which the NCAA threatens schools with sanctions if they obey any temporary court order benefiting a college athlete, should that order eventually be modified or removed. The baseball coach did not even let his ace tell his teammates the sad news in person. \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019s probably not a good idea for you to be at the game,\u2019\u201d Oliver recalls.\n\nThe Olivers went home to Ohio to find a lawyer. Rick Johnson, a solo practitioner specializing in legal ethics, was aghast that the Baratta brothers had turned in their own client to the NCAA, divulging attorney-client details likely to invite wrath upon Oliver. But for the next 15 months, Johnson directed his litigation against the two NCAA bylaws at issue. Judge Tygh M. Tone, of Erie County, came to share his outrage. On February 12, 2009, Tone struck down the ban on lawyers negotiating for student-athletes as a capricious, exploitative attempt by a private association to \u201cdictate to an attorney where, what, how, or when he should represent his client,\u201d violating accepted legal practice in every state. He also struck down the NCAA\u2019s restitution rule as an intimidation that attempted to supersede the judicial system. Finally, Judge Tone ordered the NCAA to reinstate Oliver\u2019s eligibility at Oklahoma State for his junior season, which started several days later.\n\nThe NCAA sought to disqualify Oliver again, with several appellate motions to stay \u201can unprecedented Order purporting to void a fundamental Bylaw.\u201d Oliver did get to pitch that season, but he dropped into the second round of the June 2009 draft, signing for considerably less than if he\u2019d been picked earlier. Now 23, Oliver says sadly that the whole experience \u201cmade me grow up a little quicker.\u201d His lawyer claimed victory. \u201cAndy Oliver is the first college athlete ever to win against the NCAA in court,\u201d said Rick Johnson.\n\nYet the victory was only temporary. Wounded, the NCAA fought back with a vengeance. Its battery of lawyers prepared for a damages trial, ultimately overwhelming Oliver\u2019s side eight months later with an offer to resolve the dispute for $750,000. When Oliver and Johnson accepted, to extricate themselves ahead of burgeoning legal costs, Judge Tone was compelled to vacate his orders as part of the final settlement. This freed NCAA officials to reassert the two bylaws that Judge Tone had so forcefully overturned, and they moved swiftly to ramp up rather than curtail enforcement. First, the NCAA\u2019s Eligibility Center devised a survey for every drafted undergraduate athlete who sought to stay in college another year. The survey asked whether an agent had conducted negotiations. It also requested a signed release waiving privacy rights and authorizing professional teams to disclose details of any interaction to the NCAA Eligibility Center. Second, NCAA enforcement officials went after another Scott Boras client.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays had made the left-handed pitcher James Paxton, of the University of Kentucky, the 37th pick in the 2009 draft. Paxton decided to reject a reported $1 million offer and return to school for his senior year, pursuing a dream to pitch for his team in the College World Series. But then he ran into the new NCAA survey. Had Boras negotiated with the Blue Jays? Boras has denied that he did, but it would have made sense that he had\u2014that was his job, to test the market for his client. But saying so would get Paxton banished under the same NCAA bylaw that had derailed Andrew Oliver\u2019s career. Since Paxton was planning to go back to school and not accept their draft offer, the Blue Jays no longer had any incentive to protect him\u2014indeed, they had every incentive to turn him in. The Blue Jays\u2019 president, by telling reporters that Boras had negotiated on Paxton\u2019s behalf, demonstrated to future recruits and other teams that they could use the NCAA\u2019s rules to punish college players who wasted their draft picks by returning to college. The NCAA\u2019s enforcement staff raised the pressure by requesting to interview Paxton.\n\nThough Paxton had no legal obligation to talk to an investigator, NCAA Bylaw 10.1(j) specified that anything short of complete cooperation could be interpreted as unethical conduct, affecting his amateur status. Under its restitution rule, the NCAA had leverage to compel the University of Kentucky to ensure obedience.\n\nAs the 2010 season approached, Gary Henderson, the Kentucky coach, sorely wanted Paxton, one of Baseball America\u2019s top-ranked players, to return. Rick Johnson, Andrew Oliver\u2019s lawyer, filed for a declaratory judgment on Paxton\u2019s behalf, arguing that the state constitution\u2014plus the university\u2019s code of student conduct\u2014barred arbitrary discipline at the request of a third party. Kentucky courts deferred to the university, however, and Paxton was suspended from the team. \u201cDue to the possibility of future penalties, including forfeiture of games,\u201d the university stated, it \u201ccould not put the other 32 players of the team and the entire UK 22-sport intercollegiate athletics department at risk by having James compete.\u201d The NCAA appraised the result with satisfaction. \u201cWhen negotiations occur on behalf of student-athletes,\u201d Erik Christianson, the NCAA spokesperson, told The New York Times in reference to the Oliver case, \u201cthose negotiations indicate that the student-athlete intends to become a professional athlete and no longer remain an amateur.\u201d\n\nPaxton was stranded. Not only could he not play for Kentucky, but his draft rights with the Blue Jays had lapsed for the year, meaning he could not play for any minor-league affiliate of Major League Baseball. Boras wrangled a holdover job for him in Texas with the independent Grand Prairie AirHogs, pitching against the Pensacola Pelicans and Wichita Wingnuts. Once projected to be a first-round draft pick, Paxton saw his stock plummet into the fourth round. He remained unsigned until late in spring training, when he signed with the Seattle Mariners and reported to their minor-league camp in Peoria, Arizona.\n\n\u201cYou Might As Well Shoot Them in the Head\u201d\n\u201cWhen you dream about playing in college,\u201d Joseph Agnew told me not long ago, \u201cyou don\u2019t ever think about being in a lawsuit.\u201d Agnew, a student at Rice University in Houston, had been cut from the football team and had his scholarship revoked by Rice before his senior year, meaning that he faced at least $35,000 in tuition and other bills if he wanted to complete his degree in sociology. Bereft of his scholarship, he was flailing about for help when he discovered the National College Players Association, which claims 7,000 active members and seeks modest reforms such as safety guidelines and better death benefits for college athletes. Agnew was struck by the NCPA scholarship data on players from top Division I basketball teams, which showed that 22 percent were not renewed from 2008 to 2009\u2014the same fate he had suffered.\n\nIn October 2010, Agnew filed a class-action antitrust suit over the cancellation of his scholarship and to remove the cap on the total number of scholarships that can be awarded by NCAA schools. In his suit, Agnew did not claim the right to free tuition. He merely asked the federal court to strike down an NCAA rule, dating to 1973, that prohibited colleges and universities from offering any athletic scholarship longer than a one-year commitment, to be renewed or not, unilaterally, by the school\u2014which in practice means that coaches get to decide each year whose scholarships to renew or cancel. (After the coach who had recruited Agnew had moved on to Tulsa, the new Rice coach switched Agnew\u2019s scholarship to a recruit of his own.) Agnew argued that without the one-year rule, he would have been free to bargain with all eight colleges that had recruited him, and each college could have decided how long to guarantee his scholarship.\n\nAgnew\u2019s suit rested on a claim of an NCAA antitrust violation combined with a laudable academic goal\u2014making it possible for students to finish their educations. Around the same time, lawyers from President Obama\u2019s Justice Department initiated a series of meetings with NCAA officials and universities in which they asked what possible educational rationale there was for allowing the NCAA\u2014an organization that did not itself pay for scholarships\u2014to impose a blanket restriction on the length of scholarships offered by colleges. Tidbits leaked into the press. In response, the NCAA contended that an athletic scholarship was a \u201cmerit award\u201d that should be reviewed annually, presumably because the degree of \u201cmerit\u201d could change. Justice Department lawyers reportedly suggested that a free market in scholarships would expand learning opportunities in accord with the stated rationale for the NCAA\u2019s tax-exempt status\u2014that it promotes education through athletics. The one-year rule effectively allows colleges to cut underperforming \u201cstudent-athletes,\u201d just as pro sports teams cut their players. \u201cPlenty of them don\u2019t stay in school,\u201d said one of Agnew\u2019s lawyers, Stuart Paynter. \u201cThey\u2019re just gone. You might as well shoot them in the head.\u201d\n\nAgnew\u2019s lawsuit has made him a pariah to former friends in the athletic department at Rice, where everyone identified so thoroughly with the NCAA that they seemed to feel he was attacking them personally. But if the premise of Agnew\u2019s case is upheld by the courts, it will make a sham of the NCAA\u2019s claim that its highest priority is protecting education.\n\n\u201cThey Want to Crush These Kids\u201d\nAcademic performance has always been difficult for the NCAA to address. Any detailed regulation would intrude upon the free choice of widely varying schools, and any academic standard broad enough to fit both MIT and Ole Miss would have little force. From time to time, a scandal will expose extreme lapses. In 1989, Dexter Manley, by then the famous \u201cSecretary of Defense\u201d for the NFL\u2019s Washington Redskins, teared up before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Education, Arts, and Humanities, when admitting that he had been functionally illiterate in college.\n\nWithin big-time college athletic departments, the financial pressure to disregard obvious academic shortcomings and shortcuts is just too strong. In the 1980s, Jan Kemp, an English instructor at the University of Georgia, publicly alleged that university officials had demoted and then fired her because she refused to inflate grades in her remedial English courses. Documents showed that administrators replaced the grades she\u2019d given athletes with higher ones, providing fake passing grades on one notable occasion to nine Bulldog football players who otherwise would have been ineligible to compete in the 1982 Sugar Bowl. (Georgia lost anyway, 24\u201320, to a University of Pittsburgh team led by the future Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino.) When Kemp filed a lawsuit against the university, she was publicly vilified as a troublemaker, but she persisted bravely in her testimony. Once, Kemp said, a supervisor demanding that she fix a grade had bellowed, \u201cWho do you think is more important to this university, you or Dominique Wilkins?\u201d (Wilkins was a star on the basketball team.) Traumatized, Kemp twice attempted suicide.\n\nIn trying to defend themselves, Georgia officials portrayed Kemp as naive about sports. \u201cWe have to compete on a level playing field,\u201d said Fred Davison, the university president. During the Kemp civil trial, in 1986, Hale Almand, Georgia\u2019s defense lawyer, explained the university\u2019s patronizing aspirations for its typical less-than-scholarly athlete. \u201cWe may not make a university student out of him,\u201d Almand told the court, \u201cbut if we can teach him to read and write, maybe he can work at the post office rather than as a garbage man when he gets through with his athletic career.\u201d This argument backfired with the jurors: finding in favor of Kemp, they rejected her polite request for $100,000, and awarded her $2.6 million in damages instead. (This was later reduced to $1.08 million.) Jan Kemp embodied what is ostensibly the NCAA\u2019s reason for being\u2014to enforce standards fairly and put studies above sports\u2014but no one from the organization ever spoke up on her behalf.\n\nTHE NCAA BODY charged with identifying violations of any of the Division I league rules, the Committee on Infractions, operates in the shadows. Josephine Potuto, a professor of law at the University of Nebraska and a longtime committee member who was then serving as its vice chair, told Congress in 2004 that one reason her group worked in secret was that it hoped to avoid a \u201cmedia circus.\u201d The committee preferred to deliberate in private, she said, guiding member schools to punish themselves. \u201cThe enforcement process is cooperative, not adversarial,\u201d Potuto testified. The committee consisted of an elite coterie of judges, athletic directors, and authors of legal treatises. \u201cThe committee also is savvy about intercollegiate athletics,\u201d she added. \u201cThey cannot be conned.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, a series of unlikely circumstances peeled back the veil of secrecy to reveal NCAA procedures so contorted that even victims marveled at their comical wonder. The saga began in March of 2007, shortly after the Florida State Seminoles basketball team was knocked out of the NIT basketball tournament, which each spring invites the best teams not selected for the March Madness tournament. At an athletic-department study hall, Al Thornton, a star forward for the team, completed a sports-psychology quiz but then abandoned it without posting his written answers electronically by computer. Brenda Monk, an academic tutor for the Seminoles, says she noticed the error and asked a teammate to finish entering Thornton\u2019s answers onscreen and hit \u201csubmit,\u201d as required for credit. The teammate complied, steaming silently, and then complained at the athletic office about getting stuck with clean-up chores for the superstar Thornton (who was soon to be selected by the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the NBA draft). Monk promptly resigned when questioned by FSU officials, saying her fatigue at the time could not excuse her asking the teammate to submit the answers to another student\u2019s completed test.\n\nMonk\u2019s act of guileless responsibility set off a chain reaction. First, FSU had to give the NCAA preliminary notice of a confessed academic fraud. Second, because this would be its seventh major infraction case since 1968, FSU mounted a vigorous self-investigation to demonstrate compliance with NCAA academic rules. Third, interviews with 129 Seminoles athletes unleashed a nightmare of matter-of-fact replies about absentee professors who allowed group consultations and unlimited retakes of open-computer assignments and tests. Fourth, FSU suspended 61 of its athletes in 10 sports. Fifth, the infractions committee applied the byzantine NCAA bylaws to FSU\u2019s violations. Sixth, one of the penalties announced in March of 2009 caused a howl of protest across the sports universe.\n\nTwenty-seven news organizations filed a lawsuit in hopes of finding out how and why the NCAA proposed to invalidate 14 prior victories in FSU football. Such a penalty, if upheld, would doom coach Bobby Bowden\u2019s chance of overtaking Joe Paterno of Penn State for the most football wins in Division I history. This was sacrosanct territory. Sports reporters followed the litigation for six months, reporting that 25 of the 61 suspended FSU athletes were football players, some of whom were ruled ineligible retroactively from the time they had heard or yelled out answers to online test questions in, of all things, a music-appreciation course.\n\nWhen reporters sought access to the transcript of the infractions committee\u2019s hearing in Indianapolis, NCAA lawyers said the 695-page document was private. (The NCAA claimed it was entitled to keep all such records secret because of a landmark Supreme Court ruling that it had won in 1988, in NCAA v. Tarkanian, which exempted the organization from any due-process obligations because it was not a government organization.) Media outlets pressed the judge to let Florida State share its own copy of the hearing transcript, whereupon NCAA lawyers objected that the school had never actually \u201cpossessed\u201d the document; it had only seen the transcript via a defendant\u2019s guest access to the carefully restricted NCAA Web site. This claim, in turn, prompted intercession on the side of the media by Florida\u2019s attorney general, arguing that letting the NCAA use a technical loophole like this would undermine the state\u2019s sunshine law mandating open public records. After tumultuous appeals, the Florida courts agreed and ordered the NCAA transcript released in October of 2009.\n\nNews interest quickly evaporated when the sports media found nothing in the record about Coach Bowden or the canceled football victories. But the transcript revealed plenty about the NCAA. On page 37, T. K. Wetherell, the bewildered Florida State president, lamented that his university had hurt itself by cooperating with the investigation. \u201cWe self-reported this case,\u201d he said during the hearing, and he later complained that the most ingenuous athletes\u2014those who asked \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal, this happens all the time?\u201d\u2014received the harshest suspensions, while those who clammed up on the advice of lawyers went free. The music-appreciation professor was apparently never questioned. Brenda Monk, the only instructor who consistently cooperated with the investigation, appeared voluntarily to explain her work with learning-disabled athletes, only to be grilled about her credentials by Potuto in a pettifogging inquisition of remarkable stamina.\n\nIn January of last year, the NCAA\u2019s Infractions Appeals Committee sustained all the sanctions imposed on FSU except the number of vacated football victories, which it dropped, ex cathedra, from 14 to 12. The final penalty locked Bobby Bowden\u2019s official win total on retirement at 377 instead of 389, behind Joe Paterno\u2019s 401 (and counting). This carried stinging symbolism for fans, without bringing down on the NCAA the harsh repercussions it would have risked if it had issued a television ban or substantial fine.\n\nCruelly, but typically, the NCAA concentrated public censure on powerless scapegoats. A dreaded \u201cshow cause\u201d order rendered Brenda Monk, the tutor, effectively unhirable at any college in the United States. Cloaking an old-fashioned blackball in the stately language of law, the order gave notice that any school hiring Monk before a specified date in 2013 \u201cshall, pursuant to the provisions of Bylaw 19.5.2.2(l), show cause why it should not be penalized if it does not restrict the former learning specialist [Monk] from having any contact with student-athletes.\u201d Today she works as an education supervisor at a prison in Florida.\n\nTHE FLORIDA STATE verdict hardly surprised Rick Johnson, the lawyer who had represented the college pitchers Andrew Oliver and James Paxton. \u201cAll the NCAA\u2019s enforcements are random and selective,\u201d he told me, calling the organization\u2019s appeals process a travesty. (Johnson says the NCAA has never admitted to having wrongly suspended an athlete.) Johnson\u2019s scalding experience prompted him to undertake a law-review article on the subject, which in turn sent him trawling through NCAA archives. From the summary tax forms required of nonprofits, he found out that the NCAA had spent nearly $1 million chartering private jets in 2006. \u201cWhat kind of nonprofit organization leases private jets?,\u201d Johnson asks. It\u2019s hard to determine from tax returns what money goes where, but it looks as if the NCAA spent less than 1 percent of its budget on enforcement that year. Even after its plump cut for its own overhead, the NCAA dispersed huge sums to its 1,200 member schools, in the manner of a professional sports league. These annual payments are universal\u2014every college gets something\u2014but widely uneven. They keep the disparate shareholders (barely) united and speaking for all of college sports. The payments coerce unity within the structure of a private association that is unincorporated and unregulated, exercising amorphous powers not delegated by any government.\n\nSearching through the archives, Johnson came across a 1973 memo from the NCAA general counsel recommending the adoption of a due-process procedure for athletes in disciplinary cases. Without it, warned the organization\u2019s lawyer, the association risked big liability claims for deprivation of rights. His proposal went nowhere. Instead, apparently to limit costs to the universities, Walter Byers had implemented the year-by-year scholarship rule that Joseph Agnew would challenge in court 37 years later. Moreover, the NCAA\u2019s 1975 convention adopted a second recommendation \u201cto discourage legal actions against the NCAA,\u201d according to the minutes. The members voted to create Bylaw 19.7, Restitution, to intimidate college athletes in disputes with the NCAA. Johnson recognized this provision all too well, having won the temporary court judgment that the rule was illegal if not downright despotic. It made him nearly apoplectic to learn that the NCAA had deliberately drawn up the restitution rule as an obstacle to due process, contrary to the recommendation of its own lawyer. \u201cThey want to crush these kids,\u201d he says.\n\nThe NCAA, of course, has never expressed such a desire, and its public comments on due process tend to be anodyne. At a congressional hearing in 2004, the infractions-committee vice chair, Josephine Potuto, repeatedly argued that although the NCAA is \u201cnot bound by any judicial due process standards,\u201d its enforcement, infractions, and hearing procedures meet and \u201cvery likely exceed\u201d those of other public institutions. Yet when pressed, Potuto declared that athletes would have no standing for due process even if the Supreme Court had not exempted the NCAA in the 1988 Tarkanian decision. \u201cIn order to reach due-process issues as a legal Constitutional principle, the individual challenging has to have a substantive property or liberty interest,\u201d she testified. \u201cThe opportunity to play intercollegiate athletics does not rise to that level.\u201d\n\nTo translate this from the legal jargon, Potuto used a circular argument to confine college athletes beneath any right to freedom or property in their own athletic effort. They have no stake to seek their rights, she claimed, because they have no rights at stake.\n\nPotuto\u2019s assertion might be judged preposterous, an heir of the Dred Scott dictum that slaves possessed no rights a white person was bound to respect. But she was merely being honest, articulating assumptions almost everyone shares without question. Whether motivated by hostility for students (as critics like Johnson allege), or by noble and paternalistic tough love (as the NCAA professes), the denial of fundamental due process for college athletes has stood unchallenged in public discourse. Like other NCAA rules, it emanates naturally from the premise that college athletes own no interest in sports beyond exercise, character-building, and good fun. Who represents these young men and women? No one asks.\n\nThe debates and commissions about reforming college sports nibble around the edges\u2014trying to reduce corruption, to prevent the \u201ccontamination\u201d of athletes by lucre, and to maintain at least a pretense of concern for academic integrity. Everything stands on the implicit presumption that preserving amateurism is necessary for the well-being of college athletes. But while amateurism\u2014and the free labor it provides\u2014may be necessary to the preservation of the NCAA, and perhaps to the profit margins of various interested corporations and educational institutions, what if it doesn\u2019t benefit the athletes? What if it hurts them?\n\n\u201cThe Plantation Mentality\u201d\n\u201cNinety percent of the NCAA revenue is produced by 1 percent of the athletes,\u201d Sonny Vaccaro says. \u201cGo to the skill positions\u201d\u2014the stars. \u201cNinety percent African Americans.\u201d The NCAA made its money off those kids, and so did he. They were not all bad people, the NCAA officials, but they were blind, Vaccaro believes. \u201cTheir organization is a fraud.\u201d\n\nVaccaro retired from Reebok in 2007 to make a clean break for a crusade. \u201cThe kids and their parents gave me a good life,\u201d he says in his peppery staccato. \u201cI want to give something back.\u201d Call it redemption, he told me. Call it education or a good cause. \u201cHere\u2019s what I preach,\u201d said Vaccaro. \u201cThis goes beyond race, to human rights. The least educated are the most exploited. I\u2019m probably closer to the kids than anyone else, and I\u2019m 71 years old.\u201d\n\nVaccaro is officially an unpaid consultant to the plaintiffs in O\u2019Bannon v. NCAA. He connected Ed O\u2019Bannon with the attorneys who now represent him, and he talked to some of the additional co-plaintiffs who have joined the suit, among them Oscar Robertson, a basketball Hall of Famer who was incensed that the NCAA was still selling his image on playing cards 50 years after he left the University of Cincinnati.\n\nJon King, an antitrust lawyer at Hausfeld LLP in San Francisco, told me that Vaccaro \u201copened our eyes to massive revenue streams hidden in college sports.\u201d King and his colleagues have drawn on Vaccaro\u2019s vast knowledge of athletic-department finances, which include off-budget accounts for shoe contracts. Sonny Vaccaro and his wife, Pam, \u201chad a mountain of documents,\u201d he said. The outcome of the 1984 Regents decision validated an antitrust approach for O\u2019Bannon, King argues, as well as for Joseph Agnew in his continuing case against the one-year scholarship rule. Lawyers for Sam Keller\u2014a former quarterback for the University of Nebraska who is featured in video games\u2014are pursuing a parallel \u201cright of publicity\u201d track based on the First Amendment. Still other lawyers could revive Rick Johnson\u2019s case against NCAA bylaws on a larger scale, and King thinks claims for the rights of college players may be viable also under laws pertaining to contracts, employment, and civil rights.\n\nVaccaro had sought a law firm for O\u2019Bannon with pockets deep enough to withstand an expensive war of attrition, fearing that NCAA officials would fight discovery to the end. So far, though, they have been forthcoming. \u201cThe numbers are off the wall,\u201d Vaccaro says. \u201cThe public will see for the first time how all the money is distributed.\u201d\n\nVaccaro has been traveling the after-dinner circuit, proselytizing against what he sees as the NCAA\u2019s exploitation of young athletes. Late in 2008, someone who heard his stump speech at Howard University mentioned it to Michael Hausfeld, a prominent antitrust and human-rights lawyer, whose firm had won suits against Exxon for Native Alaskans and against Union Bank of Switzerland for Holocaust victims\u2019 families. Someone tracked down Vaccaro on vacation in Athens, Greece, and he flew back directly to meet Hausfeld. The shoe salesman and the white-shoe lawyer made common cause.\n\nHausfeld LLP has offices in San Francisco, Philadelphia, and London. Its headquarters are on K Street in Washington, D.C., about three blocks from the White House. When I talked with Hausfeld there not long ago, he sat in a cavernous conference room, tidy in pinstripes, hands folded on a spotless table that reflected the skyline. He spoke softly, without pause, condensing the complex fugue of antitrust litigation into simple sentences. \u201cLet\u2019s start with the basic question,\u201d he said, noting that the NCAA claims that student-athletes have no property rights in their own athletic accomplishments. Yet, in order to be eligible to play, college athletes have to waive their rights to proceeds from any sales based on their athletic performance.\n\n\u201cWhat right is it that they\u2019re waiving?,\u201d Hausfeld asked. \u201cYou can\u2019t waive something you don\u2019t have. So they had a right that they gave up in consideration to the principle of amateurism, if there be such.\u201d (At an April hearing in a U.S. District Court in California, Gregory Curtner, a representative for the NCAA, stunned O\u2019Bannon\u2019s lawyers by saying: \u201cThere is no document, there is no substance, that the NCAA ever takes from the student-athletes their rights of publicity or their rights of likeness. They are at all times owned by the student-athlete.\u201d Jon King says this is \u201clike telling someone they have the winning lottery ticket, but by the way, it can only be cashed in on Mars.\u201d The court denied for a second time an NCAA motion to dismiss the O\u2019Bannon complaint.)\n\nThe waiver clause is nestled among the paragraphs of the \u201cStudent-Athlete Statement\u201d that NCAA rules require be collected yearly from every college athlete. In signing the statement, the athletes attest that they have amateur status, that their stated SAT scores are valid, that they are willing to disclose any educational documents requested, and so forth. Already, Hausfeld said, the defendants in the Ed O\u2019Bannon case have said in court filings that college athletes thereby transferred their promotional rights forever. He paused. \u201cThat\u2019s ludicrous,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody assigns rights like that. Nobody can assert rights like that.\u201d He said the pattern demonstrated clear abuse by the collective power of the schools and all their conferences under the NCAA umbrella\u2014\u201ca most effective cartel.\u201d\n\nThe faux ideal of amateurism is \u201cthe elephant in the room,\u201d Hausfeld said, sending for a book. \u201cYou can\u2019t get to the bottom of our case without exposing the hypocrisy of amateurism, and Walter Byers says it eloquently.\u201d An assistant brought in Byers\u2019s memoir. It looked garish on the shiny table because dozens of pink Post-its protruded from the text. Hausfeld read to me from page 390:\n\nThe college player cannot sell his own feet (the coach does that) nor can he sell his own name (the college will do that). This is the plantation mentality resurrected and blessed by today\u2019s campus executives.\nHe looked up. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the NCAA\u2019s architect.\u201d He found a key recommendation on page 388:\n\nProsecutors and the courts, with the support of the public, should use antitrust laws to break up the collegiate cartel\u2014not just in athletics but possibly in other aspects of collegiate life as well.\nCould the book become evidence? Might the aged Byers testify? (He is now 89.) Was that part of the plaintiffs\u2019 strategy for the O\u2019Bannon trial? Hausfeld smiled faintly. \u201cI\u2019d rather the NCAA lawyers not fully understand the strategy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe put the spiny book away and previewed what lies ahead. The court soon would qualify his clients as a class. Then the Sherman Antitrust Act would provide for thorough discovery to break down exactly what the NCAA receives on everything from video clips to jerseys, contract by contract. \u201cAnd we want to know what they\u2019re carrying on their books as the value of their archival footage,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThey say it\u2019s a lot of money. We agree. How much?\u201d\n\nThe work will be hard, but Hausfeld said he will win in the courts, unless the NCAA folds first. \u201cWhy?\u201d Hausfeld asked rhetorically. \u201cWe know our clients are foreclosed: neither the NCAA nor its members will permit them to participate in any of that licensing revenue. Under the law, it\u2019s up to them [the defendants] to give a pro-competitive justification. They can\u2019t. End of story.\u201d\n\nIN 2010 THE third Knight Commission, complementing a previous commission\u2019s recommendation for published reports on academic progress, called for the finances of college sports to be made transparent and public\u2014television contracts, conference budgets, shoe deals, coaches\u2019 salaries, stadium bonds, everything. The recommendation was based on the worthy truism that sunlight is a proven disinfectant. But in practice, it has not been applied at all. Conferences, coaches, and other stakeholders resisted disclosure; college players still have no way of determining their value to the university.\n\n\u201cMoney surrounds college sports,\u201d says Domonique Foxworth, who is a cornerback for the NFL\u2019s Baltimore Ravens and an executive-committee member for the NFL Players Association, and played for the University of Maryland. \u201cAnd every player knows those millions are floating around only because of the 18-to-22-year-olds.\u201d Yes, he told me, even the second-string punter believes a miracle might lift him into the NFL, and why not? In all the many pages of the three voluminous Knight Commission reports, there is but one paragraph that addresses the real-life choices for college athletes. \u201cApproximately 1 percent of NCAA men\u2019s basketball players and 2 percent of NCAA football players are drafted by NBA or NFL teams,\u201d stated the 2001 report, basing its figures on a review of the previous 10 years, \u201cand just being drafted is no assurance of a successful professional career.\u201d Warning that the odds against professional athletic success are \u201castronomically high,\u201d the Knight Commission counsels college athletes to avoid a \u201crude surprise\u201d and to stick to regular studies. This is sound advice as far as it goes, but it\u2019s a bromide that pinches off discussion. Nothing in the typical college curriculum teaches a sweat-stained guard at Clemson or Purdue what his monetary value to the university is. Nothing prods students to think independently about amateurism\u2014because the universities themselves have too much invested in its preservation. Stifling thought, the universities, in league with the NCAA, have failed their own primary mission by providing an empty, cynical education on college sports.\n\nThe most basic reform would treat the students as what they are\u2014adults, with rights and reason of their own\u2014and grant them a meaningful voice in NCAA deliberations. A restoration of full citizenship to \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d would facilitate open governance, making it possible to enforce pledges of transparency in both academic standards and athletic finances. Without that, the NCAA has no effective checks and balances, no way for the students to provide informed consent regarding the way they are governed. A thousand questions lie willfully silenced because the NCAA is naturally afraid of giving \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d a true voice. Would college players be content with the augmented scholarship or allowance now requested by the National College Players Association? If a player\u2019s worth to the university is greater than the value of his scholarship (as it clearly is in some cases), should he be paid a salary? If so, would teammates in revenue sports want to be paid equally, or in salaries stratified according to talent or value on the field? What would the athletes want in Division III, where athletic budgets keep rising without scholarships or substantial sports revenue? Would athletes seek more or less variance in admissions standards? Should non-athletes also have a voice, especially where involuntary student fees support more and more of college sports? Might some schools choose to specialize, paying players only in elite leagues for football, or lacrosse? In athletic councils, how much would high-revenue athletes value a simple thank you from the tennis or field-hockey players for the newly specified subsidies to their facilities?\n\nUniversity administrators, already besieged from all sides, do not want to even think about such questions. Most cringe at the thought of bargaining with athletes as a general manager does in professional sports, with untold effects on the budgets for coaches and every other sports item. \u201cI would not want to be part of it,\u201d North Carolina Athletic Director Dick Baddour told me flatly. After 44 years at UNC, he could scarcely contemplate a world without amateur rules. \u201cWe would have to think long and hard,\u201d Baddour added gravely, \u201cabout whether this university would continue those sports at all.\u201d\n\nI, too, once reflexively recoiled at the idea of paying college athletes and treating them like employees or professionals. It feels abhorrent\u2014but for reasons having to do more with sentiment than with practicality or law. Not just fans and university presidents but judges have often found cursory, non-statutory excuses to leave amateur traditions intact. \u201cEven in the increasingly commercial modern world,\u201d said a federal-court judge in Gaines v. NCAA in 1990, \u201cthis Court believes there is still validity to the Athenian concept of a complete education derived from fostering the full growth of both mind and body.\u201d The fact that \u201cthe NCAA has not distilled amateurism to its purest form,\u201d said the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1988, \u201cdoes not mean its attempts to maintain a mixture containing some amateur elements are unreasonable.\u201d\n\nBut one way or another, the smokescreen of amateurism may soon be swept away. For one thing, a victory by the plaintiffs in O\u2019Bannon\u2019s case would radically transform college sports. Colleges would likely have to either stop profiting from students or start paying them. The NCAA could also be forced to pay tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars in damages. If O\u2019Bannon and Vaccaro and company win, \u201cit will turn college sports on its ear,\u201d said Richard Lapchick, the president of the National Consortium for Academics and Sports, in a recent interview with The New York Times.\n\nThough the O\u2019Bannon case may take several years yet to reach resolution, developments on other fronts are chipping away at amateurism, and at the NCAA. This past summer, Sports Illustrated editorialized in favor of allowing college athletes to be paid by non-university sources without jeopardizing their eligibility. At a press conference last June, Steve Spurrier, the coach of the South Carolina Gamecocks football team (and the winner of the 1966 Heisman Trophy as a Florida Gator), proposed that coaches start paying players $300 a game out of their own pockets. The coaches at six other SEC schools (Alabama, Florida, Ole Miss, Mississippi State, LSU, and Tennessee) all endorsed Spurrier\u2019s proposal. And Mark Emmert, the NCAA president, recently conceded that big changes must come. \u201cThe integrity of collegiate athletics is seriously challenged today by rapidly growing pressures coming from many directions,\u201d Emmert said in July. \u201cWe have reached a point where incremental change is not sufficient to meet these challenges. I want us to act more aggressively and in a more comprehensive way than we have in the past. A few new tweaks of the rules won\u2019t get the job done.\u201d\n\nThreats to NCAA dominion also percolate in Congress. Aggrieved legislators have sponsored numerous bills. Senator Orrin Hatch, citing mistreatment of his Utah Utes, has called witnesses to discuss possible antitrust remedies for the Bowl Championship Series. Congressional committees have already held hearings critical of the NCAA\u2019s refusal to follow due process in disciplinary matters; other committees have explored a rise in football concussions. Last January, calls went up to investigate \u201cinformal\u201d football workouts at the University of Iowa just after the season-ending bowl games\u2014workouts so grueling that 41 of the 56 amateur student-athletes collapsed, and 13 were hospitalized with rhabdomyolysis, a life-threatening kidney condition often caused by excessive exercise.\n\nThe greatest threat to the viability of the NCAA may come from its member universities. Many experts believe that the churning instability within college football will drive the next major change. President Obama himself has endorsed the drumbeat cry for a national playoff in college football. This past spring, the Justice Department questioned the BCS about its adherence to antitrust standards. Jim Delany, the commissioner of the Big Ten, has estimated that a national playoff system could produce three or four times as much money as the existing bowl system does. If a significant band of football schools were to demonstrate that they could orchestrate a true national playoff, without the NCAA\u2019s assistance, the association would be terrified\u2014and with good reason. Because if the big sports colleges don\u2019t need the NCAA to administer a national playoff in football, then they don\u2019t need it to do so in basketball. In which case, they could cut out the middleman in March Madness and run the tournament themselves. Which would deprive the NCAA of close to $1 billion a year, more than 95 percent of its revenue. The organization would be reduced to a rule book without money\u2014an organization aspiring to enforce its rules but without the financial authority to enforce anything.\n\nThus the playoff dreamed of and hankered for by millions of football fans haunts the NCAA. \u201cThere will be some kind of playoff in college football, and it will not be run by the NCAA,\u201d says Todd Turner, a former athletic director in four conferences (Big East, ACC, SEC, and Pac-10). \u201cIf I\u2019m at the NCAA, I have to worry that the playoff group can get basketball to break away, too.\u201d\n\nThis danger helps explain why the NCAA steps gingerly in enforcements against powerful colleges. To alienate member colleges would be to jeopardize its own existence. Long gone are television bans and the \u201cdeath penalty\u201d sentences (commanding season-long shutdowns of offending teams) once meted out to Kentucky (1952), Southwestern Louisiana (1973), and Southern Methodist University (1987). Institutions receive mostly symbolic slaps nowadays. Real punishments fall heavily on players and on scapegoats like literacy tutors.\n\nA deeper reason explains why, in its predicament, the NCAA has no recourse to any principle or law that can justify amateurism. There is no such thing. Scholars and sportswriters yearn for grand juries to ferret out every forbidden bauble that reaches a college athlete, but the NCAA\u2019s ersatz courts can only masquerade as public authority. How could any statute impose amateur status on college athletes, or on anyone else? No legal definition of amateur exists, and any attempt to create one in enforceable law would expose its repulsive and unconstitutional nature\u2014a bill of attainder, stripping from college athletes the rights of American citizenship.\n\nFOR ALL OUR queasiness about what would happen if some athletes were to get paid, there is a successful precedent for the professionalization of an amateur sports system: the Olympics. For years, Walter Byers waged war with the NCAA\u2019s older and more powerful nemesis, the Amateur Athletic Union, which since 1894 had overseen U.S. Olympic athletes. Run in high-handed fashion, the AAU had infamously banned Jesse Owens for life in 1936\u2014weeks after his four heroic gold medals punctured the Nazi claim of Aryan supremacy\u2014because instead of using his sudden fame to tour and make money for the AAU at track meets across Europe, he came home early. In the early 1960s, the fights between the NCAA and the AAU over who should manage Olympic athletes become so bitter that President Kennedy called in General Douglas MacArthur to try to mediate a truce before the Tokyo Olympic Games.\n\nUltimately, Byers prevailed and effectively neutered the AAU. In November 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed the bipartisan Amateur Sports Act. Amateurism in the Olympics soon dissolved\u2014and the world did not end. Athletes, granted a 20 percent voting stake on every Olympic sport\u2019s governing body, tipped balances in the United States and then inexorably around the world. First in marathon races, then in tennis tournaments, players soon were allowed to accept prize money and keep their Olympic eligibility. Athletes profited from sponsorships and endorsements. The International Olympic Committee expunged the word amateur from its charter in 1986. Olympic officials, who had once disdained the NCAA for offering scholarships in exchange for athletic performance, came to welcome millionaire athletes from every quarter, while the NCAA still refused to let the pro Olympian Michael Phelps swim for his college team at Michigan.\n\nThis sweeping shift left the Olympic reputation intact, and perhaps improved. Only hardened romantics mourned the amateur code. \u201cHey, come on,\u201d said Anne Audain, a track-and-field star who once held the world record for the 5,000 meters. \u201cIt\u2019s like losing your virginity. You\u2019re a little misty for awhile, but then you realize, Wow, there\u2019s a whole new world out there!\u201d\n\nWithout logic or practicality or fairness to support amateurism, the NCAA\u2019s final retreat is to sentiment. The Knight Commission endorsed its heartfelt cry that to pay college athletes would be \u201can unacceptable surrender to despair.\u201d Many of the people I spoke with while reporting this article felt the same way. \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay college players,\u201d said Wade Smith, a tough criminal lawyer and former star running back at North Carolina. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to do it. We\u2019d lose something precious.\u201d\n\n\u201cScholarship athletes are already paid,\u201d declared the Knight Commission members, \u201cin the most meaningful way poss-ible: with a free education.\u201d This evasion by prominent educators severed my last reluctant, emotional tie with imposed amateurism. I found it worse than self-serving. It echoes masters who once claimed that heavenly salvation would outweigh earthly injustice to slaves. In the era when our college sports first arose, colonial powers were turning the whole world upside down to define their own interests as all-inclusive and benevolent. Just so, the NCAA calls it heinous exploitation to pay college athletes a fair portion of what they earn.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1314374", "artist_names": "Manfred Mann's Earth Band", "full_title": "Living Without You by\u00a0Manfred\u00a0Mann's Earth Band", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/517ee516000abc8529f219032511e377.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/517ee516000abc8529f219032511e377.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 1314374, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429760355, "path": "/Manfred-manns-earth-band-living-without-you-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Manfred-manns-earth-band-living-without-you-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1972, "month": 1, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "January 1972", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jan. 1972", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/517ee516000abc8529f219032511e377.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/517ee516000abc8529f219032511e377.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Living Without You", "title_with_featured": "Living Without You", "updated_by_human_at": 1603987690, "url": "https://genius.com/Manfred-manns-earth-band-living-without-you-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/204948", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/6a150edd644c364b3b76ae16bb3696f1.602x320x1.jpg", "id": 204948, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fcb1842a6e0a2b9a4d9c2a9d0ae529a1.972x951x1.gif", "index_character": "m", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Manfred Mann\u2019s Earth Band", "slug": "Manfred-manns-earth-band", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Manfred-manns-earth-band"}, "artist": "Manfred Mann\u2019s Earth Band", "lyrics": "Living Without You LyricsThe milk truck hauls the sun up\nThe paper hits the door\nThe subway shakes my floor\nAnd I think about you\nTime to face the dawning grey\nOf another lonely day\nIt's so hard living without you\n\nSo hard, so hard\nIt's so hard living without you\nSo hard, so hard\nIt's so hard living without you\nEveryone's got something\nThey're all tryin' to get some more\nThey've got something to get up for\nWell, I ain't about to\nNothing's gonna happen\nNothing's gonna change\nIt's so hard living without you\n\nIt's so hard, so hard\nIt's so hard living without you\nSo hard, so hard\nIt's so hard living without you\nSo hard, so hard\nIt's so hard living without you\n\nSo hard\n(Yeah, so hard)\nLiving without you\nSo hard\nLiving without you\n(repeat and fade)You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 31, "api_path": "/songs/181300", "artist_names": "Jordan Castro", "full_title": "James Franco by\u00a0Jordan\u00a0Castro", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/bc92269a2a08f0452a63da23af86b35c.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bc92269a2a08f0452a63da23af86b35c.399x399x1.jpg", "id": 181300, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 154453, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1438126646, "path": "/Jordan-castro-james-franco-annotated", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Jordan-castro-james-franco-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/bc92269a2a08f0452a63da23af86b35c.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bc92269a2a08f0452a63da23af86b35c.399x399x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 14, "hot": false}, "title": "James Franco", "title_with_featured": "James Franco", "updated_by_human_at": 1438126787, "url": "https://genius.com/Jordan-castro-james-franco-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/57936", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/768f2ef2665b32bb7f495d455449fe9e.486x486x1.jpg", "id": 57936, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bc92269a2a08f0452a63da23af86b35c.399x399x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Jordan Castro", "slug": "Jordan-castro", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Jordan-castro", "iq": 1018}, "artist": "Jordan Castro", "lyrics": "James Franco LyricsLast week I went to LA with Noah Cicero to act in the film adaption of Tao Lin's novella, Shoplifting from American Apparel.\n\nThe weather was mostly sunny and cold and I seemed to keep interpreting my surroundings as 'beautiful' in a manner I'd never interpreted my surroundings before.\n\nNoah and I stayed in James Roehl's living room. Outside his apartment were some chairs, a table, a nice view. Throughout my stay I sat there with different people talking about different things, thinking about different things, drinking coffee, looking at trees, etc. I tweeted 'feel unable to process thoughts in a manner that allows me to not want to \"quit everything\" and get hit by a car ' while sitting there alone.\n*\nMy first night in LA, after a day of filming on Hollywood Boulevard, I went to a party at Ken Baumann's house re Sator Press, Ken's not-for-profit publishing house that recently released Christopher Higgs' The Complete Works of Marvin K. Mooney, for which the party was being thrown. Recently, in social situations, I've noticed myself feeling acutely like a small, retarded fish with a gimp fin in a sea full of non-retarded sharks and whales, and I immediately felt this as I entered the party. I kept mumbling 'nemo' to myself and sometimes to Brad Warner. Noah saw someone he knew and from that point on seemed to be in a perpetual conversation with people he seemed to know and like. Every time I looked at him he seemed to be conveying an interested facial expression and saying interesting things. I kept thinking 'networking...' and 'I'm going to kill myself...' in a detached, playful, almost meditative manner.\n\nKen said something like 'It's nice to finally meet you' while smiling and hugging me. He said there was a bar and tacos then pointed to the bar and tacos. I sat with Brad on a couch talking about Zen and e-mails and [aforementioned 'fish feeling']. I said 'I should...try to convince someone I'm Christopher Higgs...and like, sign a book as him...or something...or convince someone I'm Ken...or something' while grinning.\n\nI met Christopher Higgs. He was wearing a suit. I complimented his outfit and he said something about 'going for the James Joyce thing' while grinning. I met Christopher Higgs' wife. We talked about Ohio and MFA programs. She seemed nice and nervous. I met Nick Antosca. I met Ned Vizzini. I met Sabra Embury. I met Ben Loory. After introducing myself he said 'I know you, you're Jordan Castro, you're famous on the internet' while grinning.\nAt some point I started to feel 'a lot better' about being at the party. I met someone named Jordan who I later found out is an actress on a show that Noah likes. I met Ken's mom. She said 'When you walked in I thought you were James Franco.' I said 'I'm James Franco' while grinning. I said 'I'm...James Franco' while grinning and walking away.\n\nSomeone introduced me to Jereme Dean who then introduced himself as 'Hollywood Daddy.' He was holding a large bag of marijuana brownies. He gave me two. I ate them while walking around and feeling happy. At some point I was standing in a circle with Jereme, his girlfriend Gena, Ben and maybe someone else. I said something like 'I feel really good. I'm at a party. Rap music is playing. I feel...really...good...' Jereme made a noise then said 'This isn't rap music.' I realized we were listening to Wiz Khalifa and immediately regretted expressing affinity toward him. I said 'Yeah...like...I mean...but...like...like...but like...you know...like...' while looking at Jereme and Gena and Ben. I asked Jereme what kind of rap music he liked. He said something like 'Eazy-E...old school shit like that. I don't really listen to a lot of new shit man. A lot of that shit's bullshit.' I thought about Brick Squad songs that reference N.W.A. and Eazy-E. A Waka Flocka Flame song came on. I noticed my heart rate increasing. I walked inside. I saw Ken then said something like 'I like Waka Flocka Flame. Is this your iPod?' He said something about being obsessed with gangster rap. I said 'Me too.' He said 'It's all I listen to anymore.' I said 'Me too.' He said something about recently having purchased 'subs' for his car. We talked about the psychology of skinny, white kids like us in terms of our affinity for gangster rap. People danced. I moved my body a little. At some point, it was established that Ken and I would have a 'shitty dance off.' I 'welcomed the challenge' but immediately 'forfeited' after he danced and I realized I would actually have to do something.\n\nI hugged and said goodbye to people, walked into the bathroom, peed a little, made weird faces at the mirror, repeatedly thought 'I'm going to kill myself' and 'What the fuck is going on.'\n\nAt James', Noah and I talked about the party, both saying we had a good time. We talked about how everyone at the party either seemed beautiful or intelligent and no one seemed depressed. I said 'I kept thinking \"I'm going to kill myself\" and like, \"I fucking hate my life,\" and stuff, but, like...in a manner like...it was just something I automatically thought when I felt...something...or something.' We talked then went to sleep.\n\n*\nI spent most of the next day in Echo Park, helping the SFAA crew and walking around. Before the shoot I met Bebe Zeva and Travis McFarland at a Mexican restaurant. I said 'Hi, I'm Jordan' while shaking their hands. We walked into a line to order food. I pointed at a cookie and said 'That looks good.' Bebe agreed and said I should get it. I said I didn't know what to get and that Bebe should decide for me. She said 'Get the chicken burger.' When it was my turn to order I said 'Chicken sandwich and a...cookie...over there, please. Oh, and a cup of coffee.' Others ordered. We sat. Bebe, Travis, Pirooz and Brad practiced saying their lines. Noah and I sat there looking at each other. I said 'I'm going to kill myself...' Noah grinned. I said 'I'm going to...kill myself...' Noah laughed. We talked about suicide. We talked about Noah's brother. At some point Bebe said 'Hold on, I'm having an existential crisis.' The food came. Noah and I talked about the texture of organic chicken compared to inorganic chicken.\n\nAt Echo Park Noah and I swung on a swing set in the middle of a lot of young children. We walked then sat near a lake. We looked at ducks. We walked. We met weird fishermen. We talked about Sam Pink and Tao Lin and interview questions and 'the myth' of people as more than people. We talked about how our trip to LA could easily be 'spun' to perpetuate 'the myth of Noah Cicero' and 'the myth of Jordan Castro.' I said 'He graduated college then got on a plane to Hollywood' while grinning. I said 'I should just...embrace the myth...embrace the myth...' while grinning. Noah said 'I feel like it would be easy to just like, put on big sunglasses and go running in the park...if you're famous. I feel like every person I see is a famous TV person.'\n\nAt some point, I started processing thoughts in a negative manner\u2014possibly due to feeling cold and/or not sleeping\u2014and I put my hat over my face and lay on grass. I bought a $5 cup of coffee. I watched the shoot. Noah 'body slammed' me repeatedly.\n*\nAfter the shoot, James, Noah, and I went back to James'. James slept. Noah and I sat and talked. Noah went to dinner with an ex-girlfriend. James drove me to Jereme's apartment. I walked on Hollywood Boulevard to meet Jereme while talking to Pirooz on the phone. I told Pirooz I'd call him back. I walked with Jereme. We talked about his job and other things. We walked into his apartment. We sat with his girlfriend and talked about the film, online literature, Sam Pink and rap music. Jereme gave me one of his copies of Sam Pink's yum yum i can't wait to die, a 'Hollywood condom' and other things. Jereme told me about the 'online literary scene' before I was a part of it. We talked about P.H. Madore and he talked about someone named Mather. Someone knocked on the door. When Jereme opened the door no one was there. He looked up and saw someone in the stairwell. The person in the stairwell asked Jereme to turn the music down. I ate two pieces of bread. We walked ~35 minutes to where Bebe and Travis were. On the way Jereme told two stories about the police. We stopped at a 7-11 and bought things, walked then said goodbye.\n\nBebe and Travis were staying in their friend Kandice's apartment. Bebe met me at the door. We walked up a flight of wooden stairs. I sat on a chair near a table. Travis and Kandice sat on a couch. Bebe sat in a chair near the couch. I said 'Hi' to Travis and 'Hi, I'm Jordan' to Kandice, who was lying with her face toward the couch cushions. Travis and Kandice said 'Hi.' I looked at things in the apartment. I felt aware of my facial expression and whether or not Kandice, Travis and Bebe seemed to want me there. I touched my face a lot. Bebe read questions from her Formspring account and Travis, Kandice and I answered them. Bebe and Travis occasionally mentioned watching The Hills Have Eyes 2. At some point, Bebe moved from where she was sitting to a chair next to me. We looked at things on her laptop and talked about them. Kandice said she felt tired and had to wake up early then went into her bedroom to sleep. Travis went into a bedroom to sleep.\n\nBebe and I talked about our careers, blogs, opinions re [various things]. We commented on things. We communicated using a word document on her laptop. Travis occasionally came out of his bedroom to get water and/or use the bathroom. He asked Bebe if she was going to stay up all night then said they had to wake up at 6AM. He asked me if I needed a ride to where I was sleeping. Sometimes he said 'What are you guys doing?' or 'What's goin' on?' or 'What time are you going to sleep?' Bebe and I typed things to each other in the word document. Around 3AM I called a cab. I hugged Bebe, said goodbye.\n\nIn the cab the cab driver talked about LeBron James. He said 'I do not like that he has tattoo 'the chosen one.' Like...you are not the chosen one. Only god can know the chosen one. You are really so arrogant to think you are the chosen one? ['Loogie' noise]. You are nothing...chosen one. Stupid man.'\n\nWhen I got out of the cab I felt extremely confused about which house was James' and where I was in general. I called James. I walked, looking at addresses on houses and mailboxes. I called James. I walked into James' apartment. I walked out of James' apartment. I walked into James' apartment. I opened my laptop. I closed my laptop. I opened my laptop and edited a video of Tao, Megan Boyle, Mallory, Brandon Scott Gorrell and I talking about books and other things. I tweeted 'slept ~3 sec and woke experiencing a distinct, \"real-seeming 'memory'\" of me telling a \"stoic, native american man\" to \"leave my cars alone\"' while sitting there alone.\n*\nAfter staying up all night I went with James to Skylight Books, where the SFAA crew was filming. James and I went to Starbucks and got coffee for people. I said 'Hi' to Bebe, Travis, Brad, others. I shook hands with someone who said 'I met you before, I'm in one of Pirooz's classes.' I said 'Oh' then 'Sorry' while grinning and moving my head. I sat on a chair drinking coffee, watching the shoot. I apologized to Pirooz for not calling him back. He said something like 'It's okay, I just figured you were blackout drunk and going crazy or something anyway' while grinning. I grinned.\nI sat on a chair drinking coffee. I read some lines to Brad to help him sound more like Tao. Pirooz pretended to 'cut' then told me to do something. I realized people were still filming and immediately felt retarded and embarrassed and self-conscious. I grinned, stuttered. People laughed. I laughed.\n\nJereme came to the bookstore and acted in a scene. I remembered seeing that Bret Easton Ellis tweeted something about his reading at Skylight Books on Thursday being his last reading ever as 'Bret Easton Ellis.' I saw a sign advertising the reading. Jereme and I each signed a release form. I watched the shoot. Jereme, Pirooz's student, Pirooz's brother and others sat in a small, clean-seeming alley, talking about the price of drugs in LA and the price of drugs in Ohio and other things. Jereme exchanged contact information with Pirooz's student. Pirooz gave Shoplifting from American Apparel t-shirts to people.\n*\nWe left the bookstore and went to James' where the next scene was to be filmed. Noah printed directions to a bookstore he wanted to go to that was 6 miles away. He left. I walked with most of the SFAA crew to where the next scene was going to be shot. I helped Brad with his lines. I looked at the sky and the park. I took pictures and texted people. I called Mallory Whitten, left her a voicemail. I saw broken beer bottles and cigarette butts on the ground.\n\nSomeone said they forgot the marker and Bebe said she forgot her makeup and someone else said they forgot something else and I volunteered to get everything. I walked back to James' apartment, vaguely 'sensing' a person behind me but not looking behind me. At some point I saw that the person behind me was one of the cameramen. He got some things from a bag. I touched some things on a table. I picked up the marker. I saw Bebe walking toward me. She said she couldn't find the lipstick she used in the park and that it needed to be the same lipstick, for continuity. I expressed sympathy and said 'That's...good...that you....care...so much...about...like...' We sat on a couch. Bebe looked through a bag for the makeup while expressing what I perceived as 'frustration and sadness.' I said 'It will be okay...is it...in Travis' car or something?' She said 'I don't think so, it should be right here' while looking through the bag. I said 'Seems...good...that you care...' then 'I feel like I want to...like, pet you...or...something...to make you feel better.' Bebe said something. I touched her back then almost immediately moved my hand away. Travis came inside and said something like 'Everyone's waiting, did you find the lipstick?' Bebe said 'No' then walked outside.\n\nLater, people ate pizza and salad. I ate a large salad. Someone said 'You don't want dressing?' I said 'No.' I said 'This salad seems...good...for being like...a pizza place salad...like...usually it's just like...iceberg lettuce...or...something...like...iceberg lettuce...' while looking at and eating the salad. Someone said 'Yeah.' I walked inside. I sat on a couch. I opened my laptop. I put headphones in my ears. I looked at and edited a video of Tao, Megan , Mallory, Brandon and I talking about books and other things. ''I said 'I feel tired' then closed my eyes. I opened my eyes. I ate a piece of veggie pizza. I ate a dark chocolate protein bar. I said 'I feel better.' James' brother walked into the room I was in. Travis and I said 'Hey.' James' brother did something in the kitchen then walked into his bedroom. Pirooz walked inside. He asked me if I wanted to watch the shoot and help out. I said 'Yeah' then walked outside. I watched many takes of the scene. I said some things to Bebe and Brad. I watched many takes of the scene. I said some things to Bebe and Brad.\n\n*\nJames drove with Noah and I to meet Pirooz and Drew at Frolic Room, Charles Bukowski's favorite bar. I was told I couldn't be in there immediately after being asked for my I.D. We walked outside. James took a picture of Noah and I. We met Pirooz and Drew at another bar, which was closed. We met Pirooz, Drew, Bebe and Travis at James' apartment.\n\n*\nAt James' apartment people drank beer and tequila. I drank one beer and one shot of tequila. Pirooz, James and Drew sat outside and played guitars. I lay on a couch. I said 'I feel so depressed...I feel so bad...' I texted Mallory and said I felt too depressed to call her or do anything in general. I drank water. Bebe and Travis said things. I ingested things. I felt better. Travis went outside. Bebe and I ingested things. We walked to the bathroom. We looked at the mirror. Bebe said something about the wall being made of a specific material. We made faces at the mirror. At some point, Travis walked inside and said 'What were you guys doing in there?' We said 'Nothing.'\n\nTravis, Bebe and I sat on a couch. Pirooz sat on a chair. Drew and James sat on a futon. Pirooz, Drew and James talked about their girlfriends and wives and other things. Someone opened a word document on my computer and Bebe and I began typing in it. We motioned for Travis to type things. We typed things for a period of time, sometimes grinning or saying things out loud. At some point James said 'What are you guys doing?' We said 'Nothing.'\n\nPirooz and Drew left. James did something. Travis, Bebe and I sat on a couch. Bebe said 'Who are you texting?' Travis said 'No one.' Bebe said 'Oh.' Travis said 'I'm making a list of things I hate.' Bebe said 'Oh' while making a facial expression. Travis said 'I hate people who talk like Tao Lin.'\n\nI asked if anyone wanted to go for a walk while standing near the door. I walked outside. I walked inside and asked if there was anywhere near James' to buy Arizona brand green tea. I walked outside. I sat. I typed things in my phone. I looked at things. Travis, Bebe and James walked outside. Bebe said 'Aw, have you been sitting here this whole time?' I said 'Yeah.' We talked about going to ChuckeCheese. James said he was going to bed. We said we were going to sit there or do something.\n\nNoah walked toward us. He said he went to dinner then a bar with Ned and Nick and had fun. We all sat, talking. Someone said something about feminism. I said 'I don't...I feel like...feminism...like...as a word...like...' then 'Hold on, I'm trying to articulate something...' then 'I'm...having trouble formulating thoughts.' I focused on trying to discern my thoughts while others talked. At some point I said 'Like...the word \"feminism\" doesn't mean anything...like...if you...like...wake up in the morning and eat spinach or if you wake up in the morning and eat spinach because you're a vegan, you're still like...doing the same thing...in concrete reality...like...I don't know...like...if you want men and women to be paid equally for the same job...then like...that's wanting something in concrete reality...to make things better...not...like...\"feminism...\" or something.' People expressed confusion re what I was trying to convey. I focused on trying to discern my thoughts. People said things. At some point I stopped trying to discern [what seemed like 'anything'] and sat there, feeling calm and good.\n\nNoah and I walked inside. I ingested something to help me sleep. We talked. Noah fell asleep. I cried silently for a period of time before closing my laptop and going to sleep.\n*\nIn the morning, Bebe Gmail chatted me saying she wanted to hang out. I asked what she wanted to do. She said Travis got fired from his job and was on his way back to where she was and that maybe we could all get breakfast together. I said 'I feel like...Travis seems to dislike me.' She said she and Travis talked about me on their way to Kandice's the night before and that Travis '[...] thought we weren't having natural personalities and [the way we were acting] seemed fake.' I typed '........' Bebe said Travis liked me. She said 'riff raff of LA.' I said something about the manner in which I felt Travis would comment on my blog if he were a random person commenting on my blog then said I felt depressed. I said 'I sat on the couch last night in the dark and closed my laptop and stared at the corner of the window for like 45 minutes.' I said 'I feel my brain actively working, or something, in a manner like it's not me controlling it, toward \"being fine with anything.\"' Bebe typed things about wanting to support Travis due to Travis having just lost his job. We decided to meet at a coffee shop called Stories.\n\nI logged out of Gmail. I drank Yerba Matte. I looked at things. I logged into Gmail. I looked at an e-mail Travis sent me apologizing for 'the negative comment [he] made' and explaining that it was his way of expressing his feelings of alienation during what was going on. He said he wanted to be bros. I thought 'Sweet...sweet...sweet...' while trying to compose an e-mail that seemed friendly. I thought 'Extra...you know...like a normal person would do...just like...say something extra...' I sent the e-mail.\n\nJames, Noah and I drove to Stories. Bebe and Travis ordered food. I ordered coffee. Noah looked at books. James ordered a latte. James, Travis and I talked about the difference between a mocha and a latte. Everyone sat, talked. James left to pick up Brad and drive him to the airport. Noah, Travis, Bebe and I talked about music, our parents, Ohio. Bebe and Travis talked about Travis' past employers. We talked about other things. We said goodbye. Bebe and Travis left.\n\nNoah and I sat in Stories not saying anything. We made eye contact. Noah grinned. We talked. We walked outside toward James'. We walked up a steep hill, sat in James' living room, talked. James walked inside. I walked outside, sat, called Mallory. Mallory said 'Hello' in a manner I perceived as 'like she was very upset' or 'like I just woke her.' She said she felt sick and sad. I said 'I'm sorry.' I apologized for not calling the night before. She said she felt worried about me. I said I was okay. She said I told her I would call her twice but didn't either time. I said 'I'm sorry' while trying to remember when I told her I'd call her. I said 'I called...and left a voicemail...and have been trying to text you like, nice stuff...to let you like, know I'm okay...and stuff...I've been texting you nice things I thought...' Mallory said I'd been texting her nice things but she missed talking to me on the phone and being with me in physical reality. I said I was sorry. She said she was lying in bed. We said other things. I walked inside.\n\nNoah and I played guitar and sang about people we'd met in LA and other people. We laughed. At some point I said 'There should be...like...a Statcounter...that...' Noah laughed then said 'Did you just say there should be a Statcounter for every time I think of you?' I said 'What?' while laughing then 'No...I was going to finish the sentence and say like...a Statcounter that you can like, put in your brain and program to count specific thoughts or something. But that sounds better. That sounds like...a song or something...' Someone said something about recording a song or a CD. James got his laptop and a microphone from his bedroom and put it on a chair. We decided to 'freestyle' a song, using two chords that Noah was playing. James said he would play electric guitar. I said I felt too self-aware to sing. I asked Noah to sing. Noah said I should sing. I looked at James. I walked into the bathroom. I walked out of the bathroom. I took a sip of tequila. I said I would sing. I said 'Last night when everyone was here, me and Bebe typed things into a word document...so we could like, say weird things and it'd be okay...or something...I'll just use those as lyrics.' We recorded for around seven minutes, occasionally singing 'There should be a Statcounter for every time I think of you' as the chorus and repeatedly singing 'Mad hits' at the end. We sat outside. I said 'I feel really good.' We walked inside. We listened to the song. I felt aware of my facial expression and worried that people didn't like my voice. Noah said 'This sounds like, you know that band WHY? This sounds like something the guy from that band would like.' I said 'Yeah' while grinning.\n*\nLater, James drove Noah and I to a Mexican flea market. Noah and I walked around while James did something else. We walked into a store. We looked at things. I picked things up, put things down. I said 'I feel like...clothes would be a bad choice...' while looking at and touching a white-and-red dress. Noah said 'Mallory would look cute in this' while touching the dress. I said 'I don't know if she'd like...wear it or whatever...seems...risky...seems risky.' I picked things up, put things down. I said 'Sorry I'm...taking so long to pick something out.' Noah made a facial expression then said 'What.' I pointed to a shirt that had a large M on it in the same font as the Michigan University logo but beneath the M was 'Mexican.' I laughed. I purchased an ugly pig mask and two cute, glass animals. We walked out of the store. We walked into a store. Noah touched things then said 'What would be a good thing for Brittany for her to keep her weed in?' I said 'I think it depends on how much weed she buys.' Noah said 'Like, a little baggy.' We looked at and touched things. Noah bought things. We walked out of the store. We walked toward James. James said he had to be a Borat singing telegram the next day and that he needed to go somewhere to buy moustache glue. We walked toward his car. While walking toward his car a woman with dreadlocks asked me if I knew where any medical marijuana dispensaries were. I said 'I wish' quietly while grinning and looking at the ground.\n\nWe got our bags from James' then drove to meet Pirooz for dinner. At dinner, people talked about the movie. We watched some footage on Pirooz's laptop. Pirooz said something about always seeing famous people in the diner we were in. Someone said something about the church of Scientology. Noah talked about moving to LA. I ordered chicken parmesan and a salad. We ate. I said something about not wanting to go to college. We walked outside. James and Pirooz talked about James' future. We hugged James, said goodbye, got into Pirooz's car, drove to the airport.\n*\nAt the airport Noah and I learned that our flight had been delayed until midnight. We sat outside. We talked about LA. We walked into the bathroom. We walked out of the bathroom. We walked through security. We sat in chairs. We talked about buying every brand of bottled water and filming a video of us drinking them and talking about them. I felt my pants hanging far below my waist. I called Mallory. I told her I was excited to have an 'epic pet session' during which I would tell her about LA. We talked about people I met in LA. Noah wrote 'Say something bad about Bebe' on a piece of paper and held it in front of my face. We walked toward Burger King. We ate chicken nuggets and french fries. We walked into the plane. We immediately fell asleep and slept for the entire flight to Milwaukee, where I ate a cinnamon roll and drank coffee then took another flight to Cleveland.\n*\nThings/people mentioned (in order of appearance): Noah Cicero, Tao Lin, SFAA (book), SFAA (film), James Roehl, Ken Baumann, Sator Press, Christopher Higgs, The Complete Works of Marvin K.

Wodehouse", "lyrics": "Jeeves Takes Charge LyricsNow, touching this business of old Jeeves -- my man, you know -- how do we  stand? Lots  of people  think I'm  much  too dependent on him.  My  Aunt Agatha, in fact, has even gone so far as to call him my keeper. Well, what I say is: Why not? The man's a genius. From the collar upward he stands alone. I  gave up trying to  run my own affairs within a week of  his coming to me. That  was about half  a  dozen years ago, directly  after  the  rather rummy business of Florence  Craye,  my Uncle Willoughby's book, and Edwin, the Boy Scout.\n\nThe thing  really began when I got back to Easeby, my uncle's place in Shropshire. I was spending a  week or so there,  as I generally did in  the summer; and I had had to  break my visit to come back to London to get a new valet. I had found Meadowes, the fellow I had taken to  Easeby with me, sneaking my silk socks, a thing no bloke of spirit could stick at any price. It transpiring, moreover, that he had looted a lot of other things here and there  about the  place, I was reluctantly  compelled  to hand the misguided blighter the mitten and go  to  London  to ask the registry office to dig up another specimen for my approval. They sent me Jeeves.\n\nI shall always remember the  morning he came. It so happened that the night before I had been present at a  rather cheery little supper, and I was feeling pretty rocky. On  top of this I was trying  to read  a book Florence Craye had given me. She  had been one of the house-party at Easeby, and  two or three days before I left we had got engaged. I was due back at the end of the week, and I knew she would expect me to have finished the book by  then. You see, she was particularly  keen on  boosting me up a bit nearer  her own plane of intellect.  She was a girl with a wonderful profile, but steeped to the gills  in  serious purpose.  I can't  give you a better idea  of the way things  stood than by telling you that the  book she'd given  me to read was called  'Types of Ethical  Theory', and that when  I opened  it  at random I struck a page beginning:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The postulate or common understanding involved in speech is certainly co-extensive, in the obligation it carries, with the social organism of which language is the instrument, and the ends of which it is an effort to subserve.\n\nAll perfectly true, no doubt; but not the sort of thing to spring on  a lad with a morning head.\n\nI was doing  my best to skim through this bright little volume when the bell  rang. I  crawled off the sofa  and  opened the door. A kind of darkish sort of respectful Johnnie stood without.\n'I was sent  by the agency, sir,'  he said. 'I was  given to understand that you required a valet.'\n\nI'd  have preferred an undertaker; but I told him to stagger in, and he floated noiselessly  through  the  doorway  like  a  healing zephyr. That impressed me from the  start. Meadows had had flat  feet and used to clump. This fellow didn't seem to have any feet at all. He just streamed in. He had a grave, sympathetic  face, as if he, too, knew what it was to sup with  the lads.\n\n'Excuse me, sir,' he said gently.\n\nThen he seemed to flicker, and wasn't there any  longer. I  heard him moving about in the kitchen, and presently he came back with a glass on a tray.\n\n'If you would drink this, sir,' he said, with a kind of bedside manner, rather  like  the royal doctor shooting the bracer into the sick prince. 'It is a  little preparation of my own invention. It is the Worcester Sauce that gives  it  its colour. The raw egg makes it nutritious. The red pepper gives it  its  bite.  Gentlemen  have  told  me  they  have  found  it   extremely invigorating after a late evening.'\n\nI  would have  clutched at anything  that  looked like  a lifeline that morning.  I  swallowed  the stuff. For  a moment I felt as  if somebody  had touched off a bomb inside the old bean and was strolling down my throat with a lighted torch, and  then everything seemed suddenly to  get all right. The sun shone  in through  the window; birds twittered in  the  tree-tops;  and,\ngenerally speaking, hope dawned once more.\n\n'You're engaged!' I said, as soon as I could say anything.\n\nI perceived dearly that  this cove was one  of the world's workers, the sort no home should be without.\n\n'Thank you, sir. My name is Jeeves.'\n\n'You can start in at once?'\n\n'Immediately, sir.'\n\n'Because  I'm  due  down  at  Easeby,  in  Shropshire,  the  day  after tomorrow.'\n\n'Very good, sir.' He  looked past me at  the  mantelpiece.  'That is an excellent likeness of Lady Florence Craye, sir. It is two  years since I saw her ladyship. I was at one time in Lord Worplesdon's  employment. I tendered my  resignation because I could not see eye  to eye with his lordship in his\ndesire to dine in dress trousers, a flannel shirt, and a shooting coat.'\nHe  couldn't  tell  me anything  I  didn't  know  about  the old  boy's eccentricity. This Lord Worplesdon was Florence's  father.  He  was  the old buster who, a  few years later, came  down to breakfast  one morning. Lifted the  first  cover  he saw,  said 'Eggs!  Eggs! Eggs! Damn all  eggs!'  in an overwrought sort of voice,  and  instantly legged  it for  France, never  to return to the bosom of his family. This,  mind you, being a bit of luck  for\nthe  bosom of the family, for old  Worplesdon  had the  worst  temper in the county.\n\nI had known the family ever since I was a kid, and from boyhood up this old  boy had  put the  fear of death into me. Time, the  great healer, could never  remove from my  memory  the  occasion  when  he found  me  --  then a stripling of fifteen -- smoking one of his special cigars in the stables. He got after me  with a hunting-crop just at the moment when I was beginning to realize that what I wanted most on earth was solitude and repose, and chased me more than a mile  across  difficult country. If  there was a flaw,  so to speak, in the pure  joy of being engaged to Florence, it  was the  fact that\nshe  rather took after her father, and one was never certain when she  might erupt. She had a wonderful profile, though.\n\n'Lady Florence and I are engaged, Jeeves,' I said.\n\n'Indeed, sir?'\n\nYou  know,  there  was  a  kind of rummy something  about  his  manner. Perfectly all right and all that, but not what you'd call chirpy. It somehow gave me the impression that he wasn't keen on Florence.  Well, of course, it wasn't  my  business.  I supposed  that  while  he  had  been  valeting  old Worplesdon she  must have trodden on  his toes  in some way.  Florence was a dear  girl, and,  seen sideways, most awfully good-looking; but if she had a fault it was a tendency to be a bit imperious with the domestic staff.\n\nAt this  point in  the proceedings there was another ring at the  front door. Jeeves shimmered out and came back  with a  telegram. I  opened it. It ran:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Return immediately. Extremely urgent. Catch first train.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Florence.\n\n'Rum!' I said.\n\n'Sir?'\n\n'Oh, nothing.'\n\nIt  shows how little I knew Jeeves in those days that I didn't go a bit deeper into the  matter with him. Nowadays I would never dream of reading  a rummy communication without asking him what he thought of  it.  And this one was devilish odd. What I mean  is, Florence knew I  was going back to Easeby the day after tomorrow,  anyway; so why the  hurry call? Something must have happened, of course; but I couldn't see what on earth it could be.\n\n'Jeeves,' I said, 'we shall be going down to Easeby this afternoon. Can you manage it?'\n'Certainly, sir.'\n\n'You can get your packing done and all that?'\n\n'Without  any  difficulty,  sir.  Which suit  will  you  wear  for  the journey?'\n\n'This one.'\n\nI had on a  rather sprightly young check that morning, to which I was a good  deal attached; I fancied it,  in  fact, more  than a  little.  It  was perhaps rather  sudden  till  you  got  used  to  it, but, nevertheless,  an extremely sound effort, which many lads at the dub and elsewhere had admired unrestrainedly.\n\n'Very good, sir.'\n\nAgain there was that kind of rummy something  in his manner. It was the way he said it,  don't  you know. He  didn't like the suit. I pulled  myself together to assert myself. Something seemed  to tell me  that,  unless I was jolly careful and nipped this lad in the bud, he would be  starting to  boss me. He had the aspect of a distinctly resolute blighter.\n\nWell, I wasn't going  to have any of that  sort of thing, by Jove!  I'd seen so many cases of fellows who had become perfect slaves to their valets. I remember  poor old Aubrey Fothergill telling me -- with absolute  tears in his eyes, poor chap! -- one night at the dub, that he had  been compelled to give  up a favourite  pair  of brown  shoes simply  because Meekyn, his man, disapproved  of  them. You  have to keep these fellows in their place, don't you  know.  You  have  to work  the good  old  iron-hand-in-the-velvet-glove wheeze. If you give them a what's-its-name, they take a thingummy.\n\n'Don't you like this suit, Jeeves?' I said coldly.\n\n'Oh, yes, sir.'\n\n'Well, what don't you like about it?'\n\n'It is a very nice suit, sir.'\n\n'Well, what's wrong with it? Out with it, dash it!'\n\n'If I might make the suggestion,  sir, a  simple  brown or blue, with a hint of some quiet twill --'\n\n'What absolute rot!'\n\n'Very good, sir.'\n\n'Perfectly blithering, my dear man!'\n\n'As you say, sir.'\n\nI felt as if I had stepped on  the place where the  last stair ought to have  been, but wasn't. I felt defiant,  if you know what  I mean, and there didn't seem anything to defy.\n\n'All right, then,' I said.\n\n'Yes, sir.'\n\nAnd then he went away to  collect his kit, while I  started in again on 'Types  of  Ethical   Theory'  and  took   a  stab   at   a  chapter  headed 'Idiopsychological Ethics'.\n\n\nMost of the way down in the  train that afternoon, I was wondering what could  be  up  at the  other  end. I  simply  couldn't see  what  could have happened. Easeby wasn't one of  those  country houses you read about in  the society  novels, where  young girls are lured on  to play baccarat and  then\nskinned  to the  bone of  their jewellery, and so on.  The house-party I had left had consisted entirely of law-abiding birds like myself.\n\nBesides, my  uncle wouldn't have let anything of that kind go on in his house. He  was  a rather stiff, precise sort  of old boy, who liked a  quiet life. He was just finishing  a history of the family or something, which  he had  been working  on for the  last year, and  didn't  stir  much  from  the library.  He was  rather a good instance of what they say about its being  a good scheme  for  a fellow  to sow his  wild oats. I'd been told that in his youth Uncle Willoughby  had been a bit  of a bounder.  You would  never have thought it to look at him now.\n\nWhen  I got  to the house, Oakshott, the  butler, told me that Florence was in her room, watching her maid pack. Apparently there  was a dance on at a house about twenty miles away that  night, and she  was motoring over with some of the Easeby lot and would be  away some nights. Oakshott said she had told  him  to  tell  her  the  moment I  arrived;  so  I  trickled  into the\nsmoking-room and waited, and presently in she  came. A glance showed me that she was  perturbed,  and  even  peeved.  Her  eyes  had  a goggly look,  and altogether she appeared considerably pipped.\n\n'Darling!'  I  said,  and  attempted  the  good  old  embrace; but  she side-stepped like a bantam-weight.\n\n'Don't!'\n\n'What's the matter?'\n\n'Every thing's  the matter!  Bertie,  you remember asking  me, when you left, to make myself pleasant to your uncle?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\nThe  idea  being, of course, that  as at  that time I  was more or less dependent  on  Uncle  Wiiloughy  I couldn't  very  well  marry  without  his approval. And though  I  knew  he wouldn't have  any objection to  Florence, having known her father since they were  at Oxford together, I hadn't wanted to take any  chances; so I  had told her to make an effort to  fascinate the\nold boy.\n\n'You told me it would please him particularly if I asked him to read me some of his history of the family.'\n\n'Wasn't he pleased?'\n\n'He was delighted. He  finished writing  the thing yesterday afternoon, and read me nearly all of it last night. I have never had such a shock in my life. The book is an outrage. It is impossible. It is horrible!'\n\n'But, dash it, the family weren't so bad as all that.'\n\n'It  is not  a history of the family at all. Your uncle has written his reminiscences! He calls them \"Recollections of a Long Life\"!'\n\nI began to understand. As I say. Uncle Willoughby had been  somewhat on the tabasco side as a young man,  and it  began to look as if he might have turned out something  pretty fruity if  he had started recollecting his long life.\n\n'If half of what he has written  is true,' said Florence, 'your uncle's youth  must  have been perfectly appalling. The moment  we began to read  he plunged straight into a most scandalous story of how he and  my  father were thrown out of a music-hall in 1887!'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'I decline to tell you why.'\n\nIt must have been  something  pretty  bad. It took  a lot  to make them chuck people out of music-halls in 1887.\n\n'Your  uncle specifically  states that father had drunk  a quart and  a half of champagne before beginning  the evening,'  she went on. 'The book is full of stories like that. There is a dreadful one about Lord Emsworth.'\n\n'Lord Emsworth? Not the one we know? Not the one at Blandings?'\n\nA  most  respectable  old Johnnie, don't you  know. Doesn't  do a thing nowadays but dig in the garden with a spud.\n\n\u2018The very same. That is what makes the book so unspeakable. It is full of stories about people one knows who are the essence of propriety today, but who seem\u2019 to have behaved, when they were in London in the eighties, in a manner that would not have been tolerated in the fo\u2019c\u2019sle of a whaler. Your uncle seems to remember everything disgraceful that happened to anybody when he was in his early twenties. There is a story about Sir Stanley Gervase-Gervase at Rosherville Gardens which is ghastly in its perfection of detail. It seems that Sir Stanley - but I can\u2019t tell you!\u2019\n\n\u2018Have a dash!\u2019\n\n\u2018No!\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, well, I shouldn\u2019t worry. No publisher will print the book if it\u2019s as bad as all that.\u2019\n\n\u2018On the contrary, your uncle told me that all negotiations are settled with Riggs and Ballinger, and he\u2019s sending off the manuscript tomorrow for immediate publication. They make a special thing of that sort of book. They published Lady Carnaby\u2019s \u2018Memories of Eighty Interesting Years\u2019.\u2019\n\n\u2018I read \u2018em!\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, then, when I tell you that Lady Carnaby\u2019s Memories are simply not to be compared with your uncle\u2019s Recollections, you will understand my state of mind. And father appears in nearly every story in the book I am horrified at the things he did when he was a young man! \u2018\n\n\u2018What\u2019s to be done?\u2019\n\n\u2018The manuscript must be intercepted before it reaches Riggs and Ballinger, and destroyed!\u2019\n\nI sat up.\n\nThis sounded rather sporting.\n\n\u2018How are you going to do it?\u2019 I inquired.\n\n\u2018How can I do it? Didn\u2019t I tell you the parcel goes off tomorrow? I am going to the Murgatroyds\u2019 dance tonight and shall not be back till Monday. You must do it. That is why I telegraphed to you.\u2019\n\n\u2018What!\u2019\n\nShe gave me a look.\n\n\u2018Do you mean to say you refuse to help me, Bertie?\u2019\n\n\u2018No; but - I say!\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s quite simple.\u2019\n\n\u2018But even if I - What I mean is - Of course, anything I can do - but - if you know what I mean \u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018You say you want to marry me, Bertie?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, of course; but still \u2014\u2019\n\nFor a moment she looked exactly like her old father.\n\n\u2018I will never marry you if those Recollections are published.\u2019\n\n\u2018But, Florence, old thing!\u2018\n\n\u2018I mean it. You may look on it as a test, Bertie. If you have the resource and courage to carry this thing through, I will take it as evidence that you are not the vapid and shiftless person most people think you. If you fail, I shall know that your Aunt Agatha was right when she called you a spineless invertebrate and advised me strongly not to marry you. It will be perfectly simple for you to intercept the manuscript, Bertie. It only requires a little resolution.\u2019\n\n\u2018But suppose Uncle Willoughby catches me at it? He\u2019d cut me off with a bob.\u2019\n\n\u2018If you care more for your uncle\u2019s money than for me \u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018No, no! Rather not!\u2019\n\n\u2018Very well, then. The parcel containing the manuscript will, of course, be placed on the hall table tomorrow for Oakshott to take to the village with the letters. All you have to do is to take it away and destroy it. Then your uncle will think it has been lost in the post.\u2019\n\nIt sounded thin to me.\n\n\u2018Hasn\u2019t he got a copy of it?\u2019\n\n\u2018No; it has not been typed. He is sending the manuscript just as he wrote it.\u2019\n\n\u2018But he could write it over again.\u2019\n\n\u2018As if he would have the energy!\u2019\n\n\u2018But \u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018If you are going to do nothing but make absurd objections, Bertie \u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018I was only pointing things out.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, don\u2019t! Once and for all, will you do me this quite simple act of kindness ?\u2019\n\nThe way she put it gave me an idea.\n\n\u2018Why not get Edwin to do it? Keep it in the family, kind of, don\u2019t you know. Besides, it would be a boon to the kid.\u2019\n\nA jolly bright idea it seemed to me. Edwin was her young brother, who was spending his holidays at Easeby. He was a ferret-faced kid, whom I had disliked since birth. As a matter of fact, talking of Recollections and Memories, it was young blighted Edwin who, nine years before, had led his father to where I was smoking his cigar and caused all the unpleasantness. He was fourteen now and had just joined the Boy Scouts. He was one of those thorough kids, and took his responsibilities pretty seriously. He was always in a sort of fever because he was dropping behind schedule with his daily acts of kindness. However hard he tried, he\u2019d fall behind; and then you would find him prowling about the house, setting such a clip to try and catch up with himself that Easeby was rapidly becoming a perfect hell for man and beast.\n\nThe idea didn\u2019t seem to strike Florence.\n\n\u2018I shall do nothing of the kind, Bertie. I wonder you can\u2019t appreciate the compliment I am paying you - trusting you like this.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, I see that all right, but what I mean is, Edwin would do it so much better than I would. These Boy Scouts are up to all sorts of dodges. They spoor, don\u2019t you know, and take cover and creep about, and what not.\u2019\n\n\u2018Bertie, will you or will you not do this perfectly trivial thing for me? If not, say so now, and let us end this farce of pretending that you care a snap of the fingers for me.\u2019\n\n\u2018Dear old soul, I love you devotedly!\u2019\n\n\u2018Then will you or will you not \u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, all right,\u2019 I said. \u2018All right! All right! All right!\u2019\n\nAnd then I tottered forth to think it over. I met Jeeves in the passage just outside.\n\n\u2018I beg your pardon, sir. I was endeavouring to find you.\u2019\n\n\u2018What\u2019s the matter?\u2019\n\n\u2018I felt that I should tell you, sir, that somebody has been putting black polish on our brown walking shoes.\u2019\n\n\u2018What! Who? Why?\u2019\n\n\u2018I could not say, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Can anything be done with them?\u2019\n\n\u2018Nothing, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Damn!\u2019\n\n\u2018Very good, sir.\u2019\n\nI\u2019ve often wondered since then how these murderer fellows manage to keep in shape while they\u2019re contemplating their next effort. I had a much simpler sort of job on hand, and the thought of it rattled me to such an extent in the night watches that I was a perfect wreck next day. Dark circles under the eyes - I give you my word! I had to call on Jeeves to rally round with one of those life-savers of his.\n\nFrom breakfast on I felt like a bag-snatcher at a railway station. I had to hang about waiting for the parcel to be put on the hall table, and it wasn\u2019t put. Uncle Willoughby was a fixture in the library, adding the finishing touches to the great work, I supposed, and the more I thought the thing over the less I liked it. The chances against my pulling it off seemed about three to two, and the thought of what would happen if I didn\u2019t gave me cold shivers down the spine. Uncle Willoughby was a pretty mild sort of old boy, as a rule, but I\u2019ve known him to cut up rough, and, by Jove, he was scheduled to extend himself if he caught me trying to get away with his life work.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t till nearly four that he toddled out of the library with the parcel under his arm, put it on the table, and toddled off again. I was hiding a bit to the south-cast at the moment, behind a suit of armour. I bounded out and legged it for the table. Then I nipped upstairs to hide the swag. I charged in like a mustang and nearly stubbed my toe on young blighted Edwin, the Boy Scout. He was standing at the chest of drawers, confound him, messing about with my ties.\n\n\u2018Hallo!\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018What are you doing here?\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m tidying your room. It\u2019s my last Saturday\u2019s act of kindness.\u2019\n\n\u2018Last Saturday\u2019s.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m five days behind. I was six till last night, but I polished your shoes.\u2019\n\n\u2018Was it you \u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes. Did you see them? I just happened to think of it. I was in here, looking round. Mr Berkeley had this room while you were away. He left this morning. I thought perhaps he might have left something in it that I could have sent on. I\u2019ve often done acts of kindness that way.\u2019\n\n\u2018You must be a comfort to one and all!\u2019\n\nIt became more and more apparent to me that this infernal kid must somehow be turned out eftsoons or right speedily. I had hidden the parcel behind my back, and I didn\u2019t think he had seen it; but I wanted to get at that chest of drawers quick, before anyone else came along.\n\n\u2018I shouldn\u2019t bother about tidying the room,\u2019 I said.\n\n\u2018I like tidying it. It\u2019s not a bit of trouble - really.\u2019\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s quite tidy now.\u2019\n\n\u2018Not so tidy as I shall make it.\u2019\n\nThis was getting perfectly rotten. I didn\u2019t want to murder the kid, and yet there didn\u2019t seem any other way of shifting him. I pressed down the mental accelerator. The old lemon throbbed fiercely. I got an idea.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s something much kinder than that which you could do,\u2019 I said. \u2018You see that box of cigars? Take it down to the smoking-room and snip off the ends for me. That would save me no end of trouble. Stagger along, laddie.\u2019\n\nHe seemed a bit doubtful; but he staggered. I shoved the parcel into a drawer, locked it, trousered the key, and felt better. I might be a chump, but, dash it, I could out-general a mere kid with a face like a ferret. I went downstairs again. Just as I was passing the smoking-room door out curveted Edwin. It seemed to me that if he wanted to do a real act of kindness he would commit suicide.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m snipping them,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Snip on! Snip on!\u2019\n\n\u2018Do you like them snipped much, or only a bit?\u2019\n\n\u2018Medium.\u2019\n\n\u2018All right. I\u2019ll be getting on, then.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should.\u2019\n\nAnd we parted.\n\nFellows who know all about that sort of thing - detectives, and so on - will tell you that the most difficult thing in the world is to get rid of the body. I remember, as a kid, having to learn by heart a poem about a bird by the name of Eugene Aram, who had the deuce of a job in this respect. All I can recall of the actual poetry is the bit that goes:\n\nTum-tum, tum-tum, tum-tumty-tum,\nI slew him, tum-tum tum!\n\nBut I recollect that the poor blighter spent much of his valuable time dumping the corpse into ponds and burying it, and what not, only to have it pop out at him again. It was about an hour after I had shoved the parcel into the drawer when I realized that I had let myself in for just the same sort of thing.\n\nFlorence had talked in an airy sort of way about destroying the manuscript; but when one came down to it, how the deuce can a chap destroy a great chunky mass of paper in somebody else\u2019s house in the middle of summer? I couldn\u2019t ask to have a fire in my bedroom, with the thermometer in the eighties. And if I didn\u2019t burn the thing, how else could I get rid of it? Fellows on the battlefield eat dispatches to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy, but it would have taken me a year to eat Uncle Willoughby\u2019s Recollections.\n\nI\u2019m bound to say the problem absolutely baffled me. The only thing seemed to be to leave the parcel in the drawer and hope for the best.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether you have ever experienced it, but it\u2019s a dashed unpleasant thing having a crime on one\u2019s conscience. Towards the end of the day the mere sight of the drawer began to depress me. I found myself getting all on edge; and once when Uncle Willoughby trickled silently into the smoking-room when I was alone there and spoke to me before I knew he was there, I broke the record for the sitting high jump.\n\nI was wondering all the time when Uncle Willoughby would sit up and take notice. I didn\u2019t think he would have time to suspect that anything had gone wrong till Saturday morning, when he would be expecting, of course, to get the acknowledgement of the manuscript from the publishers. But early on Friday evening he came out of the library as I was passing and asked me to step in. He was looking considerably rattled.\n\n\u2018Bertie,\u2019 he said - he always spoke in a precise sort of pompous kind of way - \u2018an exceedingly disturbing thing has happened. As you know, I dispatched the manuscript of my book to Messrs Riggs and Ballinger, the publishers, yesterday afternoon. It should have reached them by the first post this morning. Why I should have been uneasy I cannot say, but my mind was not altogether at rest respecting the safety of the parcel. I therefore telephoned to Messrs Riggs and Ballinger a few moments back to make inquiries. To my consternation they informed me that they were not yet in receipt of my manuscript.\u2019\n\n\u2018Very rum!\u2019\n\n\u2018I recollect distinctly placing it myself on the hall table in good time to be taken to the village. But here is a sinister thing. I have spoken to Oakshott, who took the rest of the letters to the post office, and he cannot recall seeing it there. He is, indeed, unswerving in his assertions that when he went to the hall to collect the letters there was no parcel among them.\u2019\n\n\u2018Sounds funny!\u2019\n\n\u2018Bertie, shall I tell you what I suspect?\u2019\n\n\u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe suspicion will no doubt sound to you incredible, but it alone seems to fit the facts as we know them. I incline to the belief that the parcel has been stolen.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, I say! Surely not!\u2019\n\n\u2018Wait! Hear me out. Though I have said nothing to you before, or to anyone else, concerning the matter, the fact remains that during the past few weeks a number of objects - some valuable, others not - have disappeared in this house. The conclusion to which one is irresistibly impelled is that we have a kleptomaniac in our midst. It is a peculiarity of kleptomania, as you are no doubt aware, that the subject is unable to differentiate between the intrinsic values of objects. He will purloin an old coat as readily as a diamond ring, or a tobacco pipe costing but a few shillings with the same eagerness as a purse of gold. The fact that this manuscript of mine could be of no possible value to any outside person convinces me that \u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018But, uncle, one moment; I know all about those things that were stolen. It was Meadowes, my man, who pinched them. I caught him snaffling my silk socks. Right in the act, by Jove!\u2019\n\nHe was tremendously impressed.\n\n\u2018You amaze me, Bertie! Send for the man at once and question him.\u2019\n\n\u2018But he isn\u2019t here. You see, directly I found that he was a sock-sneaker I gave him the boot. That\u2019s why I went to London - to get a new man.\u2019\n\n\u2018Then, if the man Meadowes is no longer in the house it could not be he who purloined my manuscript. The whole thing is inexplicable.\u2019\n\nAfter which we brooded for a bit. Uncle Willoughby pottered about die room, registering baffledness, while I sat sucking at a cigarette, feeling rather like a chappie I\u2019d once read about in a book, who murdered another cove and hid the body under the dining-room table, and then had to be the life and soul of a dinner party, with it there all the time. My guilty secret oppressed me to such an extent that after a while I couldn\u2019t stick it any longer. I lit another cigarette and started for a stroll in the grounds, by way of cooling off.\n\nIt was one of those still evenings you get in the summer, when you can hear a snail clear its throat a mile away. The sun was sinking over the hills and the gnats were fooling about all over the place, and everything smelled rather topping - what with the falling dew and so on - and I was just beginning to feel a little soothed by the peace of it all when suddenly I heard my name spoken.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s about Bertie.\u2019\n\nIt was the loathsome voice of young blighted Edwin! For a moment I couldn\u2019t locate it. Then I realized that it came from the library. My stroll had taken me within a few yards of the open window.\n\nI had often wondered how those Johnnies in books did it - I mean the fellows with whom it was the work of a moment to do about a dozen things that ought to have taken them about ten minutes. But, as a matter of fact, it was the work of a moment with me to chuck away my cigarette, swear a bit, leap about ten yards, dive into a bush that stood near the library window, and stand there with my ears flapping. I was as certain as I\u2019ve ever been of anything that all sorts of rotten things were in the offing.\n\n\u2018About Bertie?\u2019 I heard Uncle Willoughby say.\n\n\u2018About Bertie and your parcel. I heard you talking to him just now. I believe he\u2019s got it.\u2019\n\nWhen I tell you that just as I heard these frightful words a fairly substantial beetle of sorts dropped from the bush down the back of my neck, and I couldn\u2019t even stir to squash the same, you will understand that I felt pretty rotten. Everything seemed against me.\n\n\u2018What do you mean, boy? I was discussing the disappearance of my manuscript with Bertie only a moment back, and lie professed himself as perplexed by the mystery as myself.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, I was in his room yesterday afternoon, doing him an act of kindness, and he came in with a parcel. I could see it, though he tried to keep it behind his back. And then he asked me to go to the smoking-room and snip some cigars for him; and about two minutes afterwards he came down - and he wasn\u2019t carrying anything. So it must be in his room.\u2019\n\nI understand they deliberately teach these dashed Boy Scouts to cultivate their powers of observation and deduction and what not. Devilish thoughtless and inconsiderate of them, I call it. Look at the trouble it causes.\n\n\u2018It sounds incredible,\u2019 said Uncle Willoughby, thereby bucking me up a trifle.\n\n\u2018Shall I go and look in his room?\u2019 asked young blighted Edwin. \u2018I\u2019m sure the parcel\u2019s there.\u2019\n\n\u2018But what could be his motive for perpetrating this extraordinary theft?\u2019\n\n\u2018Perhaps he\u2019s a - what you said just now.\u2019\n\n\u2018A kleptomaniac? Impossible!\u2019\n\n\u2018It might have been Bertie who took all those things from the very start,\u2019 suggested the little brute hopefully. \u2018He may be like Raffles.\u2019\n\n\u2018Raffles?\u2019\n\n\u2018He\u2019s a chap in a book who went about pinching things.\u2019\n\n\u2018I cannot believe that Bertie would - ah - go about pinching things.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s got the parcel. I\u2019ll tell you what you might do. You might say that Mr Berkeley wired that he had left something here. He had Bertie\u2019s room, you know. You might say you wanted to look for it.\u2019\n\n\u2018That would be possible. I \u2014\u2019\n\nI didn\u2019t wait to hear any more. Things were getting too hot. I sneaked softly out of my bush and raced for the front door. I sprinted up to my room and made for the drawer where I had put the parcel. And then I found I hadn\u2019t the key. It wasn\u2019t for the deuce of a time that I recollected I had shifted it to my evening trousers the night before and must have forgotten to take it out again.\n\nWhere the dickens were my evening things? I had looked all over the place before I remembered that Jeeves must have taken them away to brush. To leap at the bell and ring it was, with me, the work of a moment. I had just rung it when there was a footstep outside, and in came Uncle Willoughby.\n\n\u2018Oh, Bertie,\u2019 he said, without a blush, \u2018I have - ah - received a telegram from Berkeley, who occupied this room in your absence, asking me to forward him his - er - his cigarette-case, which, it would appear, he inadvertently omitted to take with him when he left the house. I cannot find it downstairs and it has, therefore, occurred to me that he may have left it in this room. I will - er - just take a look round.\u2019\n\nIt was one of the most disgusting spectacles I\u2019ve ever seen tills white-haired old man, who should have been thinking of the hereafter, standing there lying like an actor.\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t seen it anywhere,\u2019 I said.\n\n\u2018Nevertheless, I will search. I must - ah - spare no effort.\u2019\n\n\u2018I should have seen it if it had been here - what ? \u2018\n\n\u2018It may have escaped your notice. It is - er - possibly in one of the drawers.\u2019\n\nHe began to nose about. He pulled out drawer after drawer, pottering round like an old bloodhound, and babbling from time to time about Berkeley and his cigarette-case in a way that struck me as perfectly ghastly. I just stood there, losing weight every moment.\n\nThen he came to the drawer where the parcel was.\n\n\u2018This appears to be locked,\u2019 he said, rattling the handle.\n\n\u2018Yes; I shouldn\u2019t bother about that one. It - it\u2019s - er - locked, and all that sort of thing.\u2019\n\n\u2018You have not the key?\u2019\n\nA soft, respectful voice spoke behind me.\n\n\u2018I fancy, sir, that this must be the key you require. It was in the pocket of your evening trousers.\u2019\n\nIt was Jeeves. He had shimmered in, carrying my evening things, and was standing there holding out the key. I could have massacred the man.\n\n\u2018Thank you,\u2019 said my uncle.\n\n\u2018Not at all, sir.\u2019\n\nThe next moment Uncle Willoughby had opened the drawer. I shut my eyes.\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Uncle Willoughby, \u2018there is nothing here. The drawer is empty. Thank you, Bertie. I hope I have not disturbed you. I fancy - er - Berkeley must have taken his case with him after all.\u2019\n\nWhen he had gone I shut the door carefully. Then I turned to Jeeves. The man was putting my evening things out on a chair.\n\n\u2018Er - Jeeves!\u2019\n\n\u2018Sir?\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, nothing.\u2019\n\nIt was deuced difficult to know how to begin.\n\n\u2018Er - Jeeves!\u2019\n\n\u2018Sir?\u2019\n\n\u2018Did you - Was there - Have you by chance \u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018I removed the parcel this morning, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh - ah - why?\u2019\n\n\u2018I considered it more prudent, sir.\u2019\n\nI mused for a while.\n\n\u2018Of course, I suppose all this seems tolerably rummy to you, Jeeves?\u2019\n\n\u2018Not at all, sir. I chanced to .overhear you and Lady Florence speaking of the matter the other evening, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Did you, by Jove?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well - er - Jeeves, I think that, on the whole, if you were to - as it were - freeze on to that parcel until we get back to London \u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018Exactly, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018And then we might - er - so to speak - chuck it away somewhere - what ? \u2018\n\n\u2018Precisely, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll leave it in your hands.\u2019\n\n\u2018Entirely, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018You know, Jeeves, you\u2019re by way of being rather a topper.\u2019\n\n\u2018I endeavour to give satisfaction, sir.\u2019\n\n\u201cOne in a million, by Jove!\u2019\n\n\u2018It is very kind of you to say so, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, that\u2019s about all, then, I think.\u2019\n\n\u2018Very good, sir.\u2019\n\nFlorence came back on Monday. I didn\u2019t see her till we were all having tea in the hall. It. wasn\u2019t till the crowd had cleared away a bit that we got a chance of having a word together.\n\n\u2018Well, Bertie?\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s all right.\u2019\n\n\u2018You have destroyed the manuscript?\u2019\n\n\u2018Not exactly; but \u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018What do you mean?\u2019\n\n\u2018I mean I haven\u2019t absolutely \u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018Bertie, your manner is furtive!\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s all right. It\u2019s this way \u2014\u2019\n\nAnd I was just going to explain how things stood when out of the library came leaping Uncle Willoughby, looking as braced as a two-year-old. The old boy was a changed man.\n\n\u2018A most remarkable thing, Bertie! I have just been speaking with Mr Riggs on the telephone, and he tells me he received my manuscript by the first post this morning. I cannot imagine what can have caused the delay. Our postal facilities are extremely inadequate in the rural districts. I shall write to headquarters about it. It is insufferable if valuable parcels are to be delayed in this fashion.\u2019\n\nI happened to be looking at Florence\u2019s profile at the moment, and at this juncture she swung round and gave me a look that went right through me like a knife. Uncle Willoughby meandered back to the library, and there was a silence that you could have dug bits out of with a spoon.\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t understand it,\u2019 I said at last. \u2018I can\u2019t understand it, by Jove! \u2018\n\n\u2018I can. I can understand it perfectly, Bertie. Your heart failed you. Rather than risk offending your uncle you \u2014\u2019\n\n\u2018No, no! Absolutely!\u2019\n\n\u2018You preferred to lose me rather than risk losing the money. Perhaps you did not think I meant what I said. I meant every word. Our engagement is ended.\u2019\n\n\u2018But - I say!\u2019\n\n\u2018Not another word!\u2019\n\n\u2018But, Florence, old thing!\u2019\n\n\u2018I do not wish to hear any more. I see now that your Aunt Agatha was perfectly right. I consider that I have had a very lucky escape. There was a time when I thought that, with patience, you might be moulded into something worth while. I see now that you are impossible!\u2019\n\nAnd she popped off, leaving me to pick up the pieces. When I had collected the debris to some extent I went to my room and rang for Jeeves. He came in looking as if nothing had happened or was ever going to happen. He was the calmest thing in captivity.\n\n\u2018Jeeves!\u2019 I yelled. \u2018Jeeves, that parcel has arrived in London!\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, sir?\u2019\n\n\u2018Did you send it?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, sir. I acted for the best, sir. I think that both you and Lady Florence overestimated the danger of people being offended at being mentioned in Sir Willoughby\u2019s Recollections. It has been my experience, sir, that the normal person enjoys seeing his or her name in print, irrespective of what is said about them. I have an aunt, sir, who a few years ago was a martyr to swollen limbs. She tried Walkinshaw\u2019s Supreme Ointment and obtained considerable relief - so much so that she sent them an unsolicited testimonial. Her pride at seeing her photograph in the daily papers in connexion with descriptions other lower limbs before taking, which were nothing less than revolting, was so intense that it led me to believe that publicity, of whatever sort, is what nearly everybody desires. Moreover, if you have ever studied psychology, sir, you will know that respectable old gentlemen are by no means averse to having it advertised that they were extremely wild in their youth. I have an uncle \u2014\u2019\n\nI cursed his aunts and his uncles and him and all the rest of the family.\n\n\u2018Do you know that Lady Florence has broken off her engagement with me?\u2019\n\n\u2018Indeed, sir?\u2019\n\nNot a bit of sympathy! I might have been telling him it was a fine day.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re sacked!\u2019\n\n\u2018Very good, sir.\u2019\n\nHe coughed gently.\n\n\u2018As I am no longer in your employment, sir, I can speak freely without appearing to take a liberty. In my opinion you and Lady Florence were quite unsuitably matched. Her ladyship is of a highly determined and arbitrary temperament, quite opposed to your own. I was in Lord Worplesdon\u2019s service for nearly a year, during which time I had ample opportunities of studying her ladyship. The opinion of the servants\u2019 hall was far from favourable to her. Her ladyship\u2019s temper caused a good deal of adverse comment among us. It was at times quite impossible. You would not have been happy, sir!\u2019\n\n\u2018Get out!\u2019\n\n\u2018I think you would also have found her educational methods a little trying, sir. I have glanced at the book her ladyship gave you - it has been lying on your table since our arrival - and it is, in my opinion, quite unsuitable. You would not have enjoyed it. And I have it from her ladyship\u2019s own maid, who happened to overhear a conversation between her ladyship and one of the gentlemen staying here - Mr Maxwell, who is employed in an editorial, capacity by one of the reviews - that it was her intention to start you almost immediately upon Nietzsche. You would not enjoy Nietzsche, sir. He is fundamentally unsound.\u2019\n\n\u2018Get out!\u2019\n\n\u2018Very good, sir.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s rummy how sleeping on a thing often makes you feel quite different about it. It\u2019s happened to me over and over again. Somehow or other, when I woke next morning the old heart didn\u2019t feel half so broken as it had done. It was a perfectly topping day, and there was something about the way the sun came in at the window and the row the birds were kicking up in the ivy that made me half wonder whether Jeeves wasn\u2019t right. After all, though she had a wonderful profile, was it such a catch being engaged to Florence Craye as the casual observer might imagine? Wasn\u2019t there something in what Jeeves had said about her character? I began to realize that my ideal wife was something quite different, something a lot more clinging and drooping and prattling, and what not.\nI had got as far as this in thinking the thing out when that \u2018Types of Ethical Theory\u2019 caught my eye. I opened it, and I give you my honest word this was what hit me:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Of the two antithetic terms in the Greek philosophy one only was real and self-subsisting; and that one was Ideal Thought as opposed to that which it has to penetrate and mould. The other, corresponding to our Nature, was ill itself phenomenal, unreal, without any permanent footing, having no predicates that held true for two moments together; in short, redeemed from negation only by including indwelling realities appearing through.\n\nWell - I mean to say - what? And Nietzsche, from all accounts, a lot worse than that!\n\n\u2018Jeeves,\u2019 I said, when he came in with my morning tea, \u2018I\u2019ve been thinking it over. You\u2019re engaged again.\u2019\n\n\u2018Thank you, sir.\u2019\n\nI sucked down a cheerful mouthful. A great respect for this bloke\u2019s judgement began to soak through me.\n\n\u2018Oh, Jeeves,\u2019 I said; \u2018about that check suit.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, sir?\u2019\n\n\u2018Is it really a frost?\u2019\n\n\u2018A trifle too bizarre, sir, in my opinion.\u2019\n\n\u2018But lots of fellows have asked me who my tailor is.\u2019\n\n\u2018Doubtless in order to avoid him, sir.\u2019\n\n\u2018He\u2019s supposed to be one of the best men in \u201cLondon.\u2019\n\n\u2018I am saying nothing against his moral character, sir.\u2019\n\nI hesitated a bit. I had a feeling that I was passing into this chappie\u2019s clutches, and that if I gave in now I should become just like poor old Aubrey Fothergill, unable to call my soul my own. On the other hand, this was obviously a cove of rare intelligence, and it would be a comfort in a lot of ways to have him doing the thinking for me. I made up my mind.\n\n\u2018All right, Jeeves,\u2019 I said. \u2018You know! Give the bally thing away to somebody!\u2019\n\nHe looked down at me like a father gazing tenderly at the wayward child.\n\n\u2018Thank you, sir. I gave it to the under-gardener last night. A little more tea, sir ?\u2019Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/869084", "artist_names": "Ray Charles", "full_title": "What Am I Living For

But you know, they didn't get here by themselves. It's been a long road and it's taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, they're like mystery stories, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think they're on the fringes now. And they sound like they've been on the hard ground\n\nI should mention a few people along the way who brought this about. I know I should mention John Hammond, great talent scout for Columbia Records. He signed me to that label when I was nobody. It took a lot of faith to do that, and he took a lot of ridicule, but he was his own man and he was courageous. And for that, I'm eternally grateful. The last person he discovered before me was Aretha Franklin, and before that Count Basie, Billie Holiday and a whole lot of other artists. All noncommercial artists\n\nTrends did not interest John, and I was very noncommercial but he stayed with me. He believed in my talent and that's all that mattered. I can't thank him enough for that\n\nLou Levy runs Leeds Music, and they published my earliest songs, but I didn't stay there too long. Levy himself, he went back a long ways. He signed me to that company and recorded my songs and I sang them into a tape recorder. He told me outright, there was no precedent for what I was doing, that I was either before my time or behind it. And if I brought him a song like \"Stardust,\" he'd turn it down because it would be too late\n\nHe told me that if I was before my time -- and he didn't really know that for sure -- but if it was happening and if it was true, the public would usually take three to five years to catch up -- so be prepared. And that did happen. The trouble was, when the public did catch up I was already three to five years beyond that, so it kind of complicated it. But he was encouraging, and he didn't judge me, and I'll always remember him for that\n\nArtie Mogull at Witmark Music signed me next to his company, and he told me to just keep writing songs no matter what, that I might be on to something. Well, he too stood behind me, and he could never wait to see what I'd give him next. I didn't even think of myself as a songwriter before then. I'll always be grateful for him also for that attitude\nI also have to mention some of the early artists who recorded my songs very, very early, without having to be asked. Just something they felt about them that was right for them. I've got to say thank you to Peter, Paul and Mary, who I knew all separately before they ever became a group. I didn't even think of myself as writing songs for others to sing but it was starting to happen and it couldn't have happened to, or with, a better group\n\nThey took a song of mine that had been recorded before that was buried on one of my records and turned it into a hit song. Not the way I would have done it -- they straightened it out. But since then hundreds of people have recorded it and I don't think that would have happened if it wasn't for them. They definitely started something for me\n\nThe Byrds, the Turtles, Sonny & Cher -- they made some of my songs Top 10 hits but I wasn't a pop songwriter and I really didn't want to be that, but it was good that it happened. Their versions of songs were like commercials, but I didn't really mind that because 50 years later my songs were being used in the commercials. So that was good too. I was glad it happened, and I was glad they'd done it\n\nPervis Staples and the Staple Singers -- long before they were on Stax they were on Epic and they were one of my favorite groups of all time. I met them all in '62 or '63. They heard my songs live and Pervis wanted to record three or four of them and he did with the Staples Singers. They were the type of artists that I wanted recording my songs\n\nNina Simone. I used to cross paths with her in New York City in the Village Gate nightclub. These were the artists I looked up to. She recorded some of my songs that she [inaudible] to me. She was an overwhelming artist, piano player and singer. Very strong woman, very outspoken. That she was recording my songs validated everything that I was about\n\nOh, and can't forget Jimi Hendrix. I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform when he was in a band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames -- something like that. And Jimi didn't even sing. He was just the guitar player. He took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and pumped them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere and turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here\n\nJohnny Cash recorded some of my songs early on, too, up in about '63, when he was all skin and bones. He traveled long, he traveled hard, but he was a hero of mine. I heard many of his songs growing up. I knew them better than I knew my own. \"Big River,\" \"I Walk the Line.\"\n\n\"How high's the water, Mama?\" I wrote \"It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\" with that song reverberating inside my head. I still ask, \"How high is the water, mama?\" Johnny was an intense character. And he saw that people were putting me down playing electric music, and he posted letters to magazines scolding people, telling them to shut up and let him sing\n\nIn Johnny Cash's world -- hardcore Southern drama -- that kind of thing didn't exist. Nobody told anybody what to sing or what not to sing. They just didn't do that kind of thing. I'm always going to thank him for that. Johnny Cash was a giant of a man, the man in black. And I'll always cherish the friendship we had until the day there is no more days\n\nOh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Joan Baez. She was the queen of folk music then and now. She took a liking to my songs and brought me with her to play concerts, where she had crowds of thousands of people enthralled with her beauty and voice\n\nPeople would say, \"What are you doing with that ragtag scrubby little waif?\" And she'd tell everybody in no uncertain terms, \"Now you better be quiet and listen to the songs.\" We even played a few of them together. Joan Baez is as tough-minded as they come. Love. And she's a free, independent spirit. Nobody can tell her what to do if she doesn't want to do it. I learned a lot of things from her. A woman with devastating honesty. And for her kind of love and devotion, I could never pay that back\n\nLRelated Rare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface via eBay sale\nPOP & HISS\nRare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface via eBay sale\nSEE ALL RELATED\n8\nYou might also likeGRAMMYS 2015: Complete list | Show highlights | Quotes | Best & worst\n\nThe secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylan's new album\nThe secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylan's new album\nThese songs didn't come out of thin air. I didn't just make them up out of whole cloth. Contrary to what Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional music: traditional folk music, traditional rock 'n' roll and traditional big-band swing orchestra music\n\nI learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them back when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me the code for everything that's fair game, that everything belongs to everyone\n\nFor three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses, fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one  song and sing it next in an hour if I'd heard it just once\n\n\nIf you sang \"John Henry\" as many times as me -- \"John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer in his hand / John Henry said a man ain't nothin' but a man / Before I let that steam drill drive me down / I'll die with that hammer in my hand.\"\n\nIf you had sung that song as many times as I did, you'd have written \"How many roads must a man walk down?\" too\n\nBig Bill Broonzy had a song called \"Key to the Highway.\" \"I've got a key to the highway / I'm booked and I'm bound to go / Gonna leave here runnin' because walking is most too slow.\" I sang that a lot. If you sing that a lot, you just might write\n\nGeorgia Sam he had a bloody nose\n\nWelfare Department they wouldn\u2019t give him no clothes\n\nHe asked poor Howard where can I go\n\nHoward said there\u2019s only one place I know\n\nSam said tell me quick man I got to run\nHoward just pointed with his gun\nAnd said that way down on Highway 61\n\nYou'd have written that too if you'd sang \"Key to the Highway\" as much as me\n\n\"Ain't no use sit 'n cry / You'll be an angel by and by / Sail away, ladies, sail away.\" \"I'm sailing away my own true love.\" \"Boots of Spanish Leather\" -- Sheryl Crow just sung that\n\n\"Roll the cotton down, aw, yeah, roll the cotton down / Ten dollars a day is a white man's pay / A dollar a day is the black man's pay / Roll the cotton down.\" If you sang that song as many times as me, you'd be writing \"I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more,\" too\nI sang a lot of \"come all you\" songs. There's plenty of them. There's way too  many to be counted. \"Come along boys and listen to my tale / Tell you of my trouble on the old Chisholm Trail.\" Or, \"Come all ye good people, listen while I tell / the fate of Floyd Collins a lad we all know well / The fate of Floyd Collins, a lad we all know well.\"\n\n\"Come all ye fair and tender ladies / Take warning how you court your men / They're like a star on a summer morning / They first appear and then they're gone again.\" \"If you'll gather 'round, people / A story I will tell /  'Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw / Oklahoma knew him well.\"\n\nIf you sung all these \"come all ye\" songs all the time, you'd be writing, \"Come gather 'round people where ever you roam, admit that the waters around you have grown / Accept that soon you'll be drenched to the bone / If your time to you is worth saving / And you better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone / The times they are a-changing.\"\n\nYou'd have written them too. There's nothing secret about it. You just do it subliminally and unconsciously, because that's all enough, and that's all I sang. That was all that was dear to me. They were the only kinds of songs that made sense\n\n\"When you go down to Deep Ellum keep your money in your socks / Women in Deep Ellum put you on the rocks.\" Sing that song for a while and you just might come up with, \"When you're lost in the rain in Juarez and it's Easter time too / And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through / Don\u2019t put on any airs / When you\u2019re down on Rue Morgue Avenue / They got some hungry women there / And they really make a mess outta you.\"\n\nAll these songs are connected. Don't be fooled. I just opened up a different door in a different kind of way. It's just different, saying the same thing. I didn't think it was anything out of the ordinary\n\nWell you know, I just thought I was doing something natural, but right from the start, my songs were divisive for some reason. They divided people. I never knew why. Some got angered, others loved them. Didn't know why my songs had detractors and supporters. A strange environment to have to throw your songs into, but I did it anyway\n\nLast thing I thought of was who cared about what song I was writing. I was just writing them. I didn't think I was doing anything different. I thought I was just extending the line. Maybe a little bit unruly, but I was just elaborating on situations. Maybe hard to pin down, but so what? A lot of people are hard to pin down. You've just got to bear it. I didn't really care what Lieber and Stoller thought of my songs\n\nThey didn't like 'em, but Doc Pomus did. That was all right that they didn't like 'em, because I never liked their songs either. \"Yakety yak, don't talk back.\" \"Charlie Brown is a clown,\" \"Baby I'm a hog for you.\" Novelty songs. They weren't saying anything serious. Doc's songs, they were better. \"This Magic Moment.\" \"Lonely Avenue.\" Save the Last Dance for Me\n\nThose songs broke my heart. I figured I'd rather have his blessings any day than theirs\n\nAhmet Ertegun didn't think much of my songs, but Sam Phillips did. Ahmet founded Atlantic Records. He produced some great records: Ray Charles, Ray Brown, just to name a few\n\nThere were some great records in there, no question about it. But Sam Phillips, he recorded Elvis and Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Radical eyes that shook the very essence of humanity. Revolution in style and scope. Heavy shape and color. Radical to the bone. Songs that cut you to the bone. Renegades in all degrees, doing songs that would never decay, and still resound to this day. Oh, yeah, I'd rather have Sam Phillips' blessing any day\n\nMerle Haggard didn't even think much of my songs. I know he didn't. He didn't say that to me, but I know [inaudible]. Buck Owens did, and he recorded some of my early songs. Merle Haggard -- \"Mama Tried,\" \"The Bottle Let Me Down,\" \"I'm a Lonesome Fugitive.\" I can't imagine Waylon Jennings singing \"The Bottle Let Me Down.\"\n\n\"Together Again\"? That's Buck Owens, and that trumps anything coming out of Bakersfield. Buck Owens and Merle Haggard? If you have to have somebody's blessing -- you figure it out\n\nOh, yeah. Critics have been giving me a hard time since Day One. Critics say I can't sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why don't critics say that same thing about Tom Waits? Critics say my voice is shot. That I have no voice. What don't they say those things about Leonard Cohen? Why do I get special treatment? Critics say I can't carry a tune and I talk my way through a song. Really? I've never heard that said about Lou Reed. Why does he get to go scot-free?\n\nYep. A more gracious way to lament or \"woe is me\" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...\n\nWhat have I done to deserve this special attention? No vocal range? When's the last time you heard Dr. John? Why don't you say that about him? Slur my words, got no diction. Have you people ever listened to Charley Patton or Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters. Talk about slurred words and no diction. [Inaudible] doesn't even matter\n\n\"Why me, Lord?\" I would say that to myself\n\nCritics say I mangle my melodies, render my songs unrecognizable. Oh, really? Let me tell you something. I was at a boxing match a few years ago seeing Floyd Mayweather fight a Puerto Rican guy. And the Puerto Rican national anthem, somebody sang it and it was beautiful. It was heartfelt and it was moving\n\nAfter that it was time for our national anthem. And a very popular soul-singing sister was chosen to sing. She sang every note -- that exists, and some that don't exist. Talk about mangling a melody. You take a one-syllable word and make it last for 15 minutes? She was doing vocal gymnastics like she was on a trapeze act. But to me it was not funny\n\nWhere were the critics? Mangling lyrics? Mangling a melody? Mangling a treasured song? No, I get the blame. But I don't really think I do that. I just think critics say I do\n\nSam Cooke said this when told he had a beautiful voice: He said, \"Well that's very kind of you, but voices ought not to be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter only if they convince you that they are telling the truth.\" Think about that the next time you [inaudible]\n\nTimes always change. They really do. And you have to always be ready for something that's coming along and you never expected it. Way back when, I was in Nashville making some records and I read this article, a Tom T. Hall interview. Tom T. Hall, he was bitching about some kind of new song, and he couldn't understand what these new kinds of songs that were coming in were about\n\nNow Tom, he was one of the most preeminent songwriters of the time in Nashville. A lot of people were recording his songs and he himself even did it. But he was all in a fuss about James Taylor, a song James had called \"Country Road.\" Tom was going off in this  interview -- \"But James don't say nothing about a country road. He's just says how you can feel it on the country road. I don't understand that.\"\n\nNow some might say Tom is a great songwriter. I'm not going to doubt that. At the time he was doing this interview I was actually listening to a song of his on the radio\n\nIt was called \"I Love.\" I was listening to it in a recording studio, and he was talking about all the things he loves, an everyman kind of song, trying to connect with people. Trying to make you think that he's just like you and you're just like him. We all love the same things, and we're all in this together. Tom loves little baby ducks, slow-moving trains and rain. He loves old pickup trucks and little country streams. Sleeping without dreams. Bourbon in a glass. Coffee in a cup. Tomatoes on the vine, and onions\nNow listen, I'm not ever going to disparage another songwriter. I'm not going to do that. I'm not saying it's a bad song. I'm just saying it might be a little overcooked. But, you know, it was in the top 10 anyway. Tom and a few other writers had the whole Nashville scene sewed up in a box. If you wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go to them, and Tom was one of the top guys. They were all very comfortable, doing their thing\n\nThis was about the time that Willie Nelson picked up and moved to Texas. About the same time. He's still in Texas. Everything was very copacetic. Everything was all right until -- until -- Kristofferson came to town. Oh, they ain't seen anybody like him. He came into town like a wildcat, flew his helicopter into Johnny Cash's backyard like a typical songwriter. And he went for the throat. \"Sunday Morning Coming Down.\"\n\nWell, I woke up Sunday morning\n\nGrammys 2014: MusiCares gala celebrates the music of Carole King\nGrammys 2014: MusiCares gala celebrates the music of Carole King\nWith no way to hold my head that didn't hurt\n\nAnd the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad\n\nSo I had one more for dessert\n\nThen I fumbled through my closet\n\nFound my cleanest dirty shirt\n\nThen I washed my face and combed my hair\n\nAnd stumbled down the stairs to meet the day\n\nYou can look at Nashville pre-Kris and post-Kris, because he changed everything. That one song ruined Tom T. Hall's poker parties. It might have sent him to the crazy house.

A more gracious way to lament or \"woe is me\" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...\nRICHARDOVICH\nAT 1:43 PM FEBRUARY 09, 2015\nADD A COMMENTSEE ALL COMMENTS\n45\n\nBut, you know, I'm glad they mention their names, and you know what? I'm glad they got their names in the press. It might have taken some time to do it, but they're finally there. I can only wonder why it took so long. My only regret is that they're not here to see it\n\nTraditional rock 'n' roll, we're talking about that. It's all about rhythm. Johnny Cash said it best: \"Get rhythm. Get rhythm when you get the blues.\" Very few rock 'n' roll bands today play with rhythm. They don't know what it is. Rock 'n' roll is a combination of blues, and it's a strange thing made up of two parts. A lot of people don't know this, but the blues, which is an American music, is not what you think it is. It's a combination of Arabic violins and Strauss waltzes working it out. But it's true\n\n\nThe other half of rock 'n' roll has got to be hillbilly. And that's a derogatory term, but it ought not to be. That's a term that includes the Delmore Bros., Stanley Bros., Roscoe Holcomb, Clarence Ashley ... groups like that. Moonshiners gone berserk. Fast cars on dirt roads. That's the kind of combination that makes up rock 'n' roll, and it can't be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio\n\nYou have to have the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music. If you can't hardly play the blues, how do you [inaudible] those other two kinds of music in there? You can fake it, but you can't really do it\n\nCritics have made a career out of accusing me of having a career of confounding expectations. Really? Because that's all I do. That's how I think about it. Confounding expectations\n\n\"What do you do for a living, man?\"\n\n\"Oh, I confound expectations.\"\n\nYou're going to get a job, the man says, \"What do you do?\" \"Oh, confound expectations.: And the man says, \"Well, we already have that spot filled. Call us back. Or don't call us, we'll call you.\" Confounding expectations. What does that mean? 'Why me, Lord? I'd confound them, but I don't know how to do it.'\n\nThe Blackwood Bros. have been talking to me about making a record together. That might confound expectations, but it shouldn't. Of course it would be a gospel album. I don't think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me. Not a bit. One of the songs I'm thinking about singing is \"Stand By Me\" by the Blackwood Brothers. Not \"Stand By Me\" the pop song. No. The real \"Stand By Me.\"\n\nThe real one goes like this:\n\nWhen the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the world is tossing me / Like a ship upon the sea / Thou who rulest wind and water / Stand by me\n\nIn the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / When the hosts of hell assail / And my strength begins to fail / Thou who never lost a battle / Stand by me\n\nIn the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / When I do the best I can / And my friends don't understand / Thou who knowest all about  me / Stand by me\n\nThat's the song. I like it better than the pop song. If I record one by that name, that's going to be the one. I'm also thinking of recording a song, not on that album, though: \"Oh Lord, Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.\"\n\nAnyway, why me, Lord. What did I do?\n\nAnyway, I'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I'm honored to have all these artists singing my songs. There's nothing like that. Great artists. [applause, inaudible]. They're all singing the truth, and you can hear it in their voices\n\nI'm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I think a lot of this organization. They've helped many people. Many musicians who have contributed a lot to our culture. I'd like to personally thank them for what they did for a friend of mine, Billy Lee Riley. A friend of mine who they helped for six years when he was down and couldn't work. Billy was a son of rock 'n' roll, obviously\n\n\nHe was a true original. He did it all: He played, he sang, he wrote. He would have been a bigger star but Jerry Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that comes along. You just don't stand a chance\n\nSo Billy became what is known in the industry -- a condescending term, by the way -- as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, once in a while, a one-hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star who's got 20 or 30 hits behind him. And Billy's hit song was called \"Red Hot,\" and it was red hot. It could blast you out of your skull and make you feel happy about it. Change your life\n\nHe did it with style and grace. You won't find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He's not there. Metallica is. Abba is. Mamas and the Papas -- I know they're in there. Jefferson Airplane, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan -- I've got nothing against them. Soft rock, hard rock, psychedelic pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff, but after all, it is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there. Yet\n\nI'd see him a couple times a year and we'd always spent time together and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit, and we'd cross paths now and again. We'd always spend time together. He was a hero of mine. I'd heard \"Red Hot.\" I must have been only 15 or 16 when I did and it's impressed me to this day\n\nYep. A more gracious way to lament or \"woe is me\" the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when I'm finished thinking I have to die a lot There's torture and there's killing And there's all my bad reviews The war,...\n\nI never grow tired of listening to it. Never got tired of watching Billy Lee perform, either. We spent time together just talking and playing into the night. He was a deep, truthful man. He wasn't bitter or nostalgic. He just accepted it. He knew where he had come from and he was content with who he was\n\nAnd then one day he got sick. And like my friend John Mellencamp would sing -- because John sang some truth today -- one day you get sick and you don't get better. That's from a song of his called \"Life is Short Even on Its Longest Days.\" It's one of the better songs of the last few years, actually. I ain't lying\n\nAnd I ain't lying when I tell you that MusiCares paid for my friend's doctor bills, and helped him to get spending money. They were able to at least make his life comfortable, tolerable to the end. That is something that can't be repaid. Any organization that would do that would have to have my blessing\n\nI'm going to get out of here now. I'm going to put an egg in my shoe and beat it. I probably left out a lot of people and said too much about some. But that's OK. Like the spiritual song, 'I'm still just crossing over Jordan too.' Let's hope we meet again. Sometime. And we will, if, like Hank Williams said, \"the good Lord willing and the creek don't rise.\"1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1388281", "artist_names": "Stampeders", "full_title": "Devil You by\u00a0Stampeders", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/a4ac0b207490361e8627b45f614f9424.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a4ac0b207490361e8627b45f614f9424.999x999x1.jpg", "id": 1388281, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 930466, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1666057116, "path": "/Stampeders-devil-you-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Stampeders-devil-you-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1971, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1971", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1971", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/a4ac0b207490361e8627b45f614f9424.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a4ac0b207490361e8627b45f614f9424.999x999x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Devil You", "title_with_featured": "Devil You", "updated_by_human_at": 1666057116, "url": "https://genius.com/Stampeders-devil-you-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/355119", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c8745e32f94aec6cca5fe682295f3f7c.800x800x1.png", "id": 355119, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c8745e32f94aec6cca5fe682295f3f7c.800x800x1.png", "index_character": "s", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Stampeders", "slug": "Stampeders", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Stampeders"}, "artist": "Stampeders", "lyrics": "Devil You LyricsDevil you\nWhen will you ever learn?\nI said now, devil you\nSomeday, you're gonna burn\nDevil you\nYou never ever come home\nAll the time you spend wanderin'\nYou might as well be on your own\n\nI said now, devil you\nYou were my one desire\nI said now, devil you\nYou used to light my fire\nDevil you\nWe can't go on this way\nAh, you're gone in the night\nI never see you in the day\nAnd all them mornings when I'm sleepin' sound\nYou knock, knock, knock, knock, knock till the door falls down\nAnd all them men friends you hang around with\nNow, devil you, devil you\nWhat you do\n\nDevil you\nYou're really into sin\nIf you tell on them all\nSomebody's gonna turn you in\n\nAnd all them mornings when I'm sleepin' sound\nYou knock, knock, knock, knock, knock till the door falls down\nAnd all them men friends you hang around with\nNow, devil you, devil you\nWhat you do\n\nDevil youYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/316862", "artist_names": "The Doors", "full_title": "Tightrope Ride by\u00a0The\u00a0Doors", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/890b8c12ac0abb7359b194b2dc8623b8.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/890b8c12ac0abb7359b194b2dc8623b8.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 316862, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 354381, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": null, "path": "/The-doors-tightrope-ride-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/The-doors-tightrope-ride-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1971, "month": 10, "day": 18}, "release_date_for_display": "October 18, 1971", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Oct. 18, 1971", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/890b8c12ac0abb7359b194b2dc8623b8.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/890b8c12ac0abb7359b194b2dc8623b8.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Tightrope Ride", "title_with_featured": "Tightrope Ride", "updated_by_human_at": 1605992549, "url": "https://genius.com/The-doors-tightrope-ride-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/601", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/497e3700dd979d2d43f3480d5a67028c.1000x563x1.jpg", "id": 601, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/38fa7e8d413953545eb24a974b21847e.570x570x1.jpg", "index_character": "d", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "The Doors", "slug": "The-doors", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/The-doors"}, "artist": "The Doors", "lyrics": "Tightrope Ride Lyrics[Intro]\nYou're on a tightrope ride, nobody by your side\nWell, you're all alone, got to find a new home\n\n[Verse]\nDon't go over the line.

did you say to yourself that woman is the devil's tool?\nSomehow you knew that you blew it again and didn't wanna look like a ravin fool\nBut when you need affection\nYou go to her with a smilin' face\nBut now she's got a strange reaction\n\nFor ladies only\nTired of talkin' 'till somebody hears\nFor ladies only\nHalf the world has been built upon their tears\nIf you've been contemplatin' just what you're doin' wrong\nThen you will be a witness to the rumble goin' on\nYou fight it hard to tell apart the truth from the jive\nThey've got a right to say it wrong if freedom's to survive\nNow if you don't believe your own reflection\nJust take a look at all your smooth talkin' friends\nI'm sure you'll make the right connection\n\nFor ladies only\nToo much waiting for too many years\nFor ladies only\nHalf the world has been built upon their tears\n\nI'll give you my donation to help the cause along\nI'll make my contribution 'till the fight has been won\nBut when my bedroom closes one thing remains\nMan, woman, hog or dog, I'm callin' the plays\nAnd if you find the need to raise objections\nDon't talk to me 'bout your wasted time\nYou know you made your own selections\n\nFor ladies only\nToo much waiting for too many years\nFor ladies only\nHalf the world has been built on their tears\nFor ladies only\nTired of talkin' 'till somebody hears\nFor ladies only\nHalf the world has

Lyrics[Spoken word prologue]\nYou know, I remember a few years ago\nSome funny things used to happen to me\nAbout 1956-57\n\nAt that time there was no blues scene\nOr not really any kind of scene in London\nI used to go out and play my guitar in the streets\nAnd sing things with passing my hat down\n\nI remember one particular night\nI was playing the guitar in a little alleyway\nJust off of Wardour Street in Soho\nAnd I got busted by the police\nThis policeman come up and dragged me and my guitar\nAnd my hat full of pennies off to the police station\n\nAnyway, the next day\nI had to appear in Marlborough Street Police Court\nAnd it was quite a day\nPolice officer giving his evidence\n\n\"I was proceeding in a southerly direction, milord\nWhen I heard strange sounds\nComing from Wardour Place, milord\nA sort of 'boo-gee woo-gee' music was being played\nOn further investigation, I saw the defendant\nStanding there with a guitar and an old hat\nOn the floor collecting pennies\nWell, I decided that he was contravening\nA breach of the peace there, as there was\nA traffic jam about five miles long down Wardour Street\nWondering what all the fuss was about\nSo then I arrested the defendant\"\n\n\"Ah, just one moment, officer\nWell, what is this 'boo-gee woo-gee' music\nHere we're talking about?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, milord\", said the officer\nGetting out his notebook, obviously\nBeen doing up his homework\n\"It's a kind of jazz-rhythm music\nPeculiar to the American-Negro\"\nYou might also like\"Oh! And what was the defendant doing\nPlaying this kind of music there in Wardour Street?\"\n\nAnyway I got off with a caution\nA year's conditional discharge\nBut I'll always remember that policeman\nAnd his \"boo-gee woo-gee\"\nSo don't try to lay no \"boo-gee woo-gee\"\nOn the king of rock and roll\nHo!\n\n[First verse]\nDon't tell me nothing, don't lies, a woman\n'Cause all you know I've told\nDon't sell me no alibis, sister\n'Cause all you've got I've sold\nYou better leave at a-midnight a-slinking\nTo the one who works it out\nI don't want to hear no rack-tackem squeaking\nGo on and shut your mouth\nAnd everything is gonna work out tight\nIf you ain't like you been told\nJust don't try to lay no boogie woogie\nOn the king of rock and roll\n\n[Second verse]\nDon't feed me no TV dinners\nWhen you know that I'm used to steak\nI don't need no rank beginners\nWhen it's time to shake the shake\nYou better pull your thing together\nWhen you've been dusted out\nAnd if you feel that you just can't dig it\nYou know you don't know what it's all about\nIt ain't a matter of per convenience\nThat's gonna justify your soul\nJust don't try to lay no boogie woogie\nOn the king of rock and roll\n[Instrumental bridge]\n\nDon't try to lay no boogie woogie\nOn the king of rock and roll\n\n[Third verse]\nYou weren't alive when I started to jive\nSo don't pull nothing on me\nYou didn't arrive til late '45\nBut your head's in '53\nYou got what it takes, get their heads a-spinnin'\nDown by the lonely shack\nBut you come on just like a fool woman\nIn the back of a red Cadillac\nYou can't come across the Oxbow Bridge\nUntil you pay the toll\nSo don't try to lay no boogie woogie\nOn the king of rock and roll8Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

nowhere\nTo make me know that I still care\nThose lonely nights without you in sight\nWere too much for me to bare\nBut oh, I left my pride\nCast your love aside\n[Hook]\nIt took a one way ticket to nowhere\nTo make me know I love you, baby I love you\n(It took a one way ticket)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI tried to get you off of my mind\nBy wasting some other girl's time\nDidn't have no conversation, didn't know my destination\nI just laughed to keep on time\nA smile was out of plac\u0435, it showed all over my face\n\n[Hook]\nIt took a on\u0435 way ticket to nowhere\nTo make me know I love you, oh baby\n(It took a one way ticket)\n\n[Verse 3]\nOh, forgive me, girl\nFor I know that it won't be long\nBut all you got to do is keep a light burnin' in the window\nTo TV come marchin' home, 'cause I'll be there, baby\n'Cause I love you, mmm\n\n[Bridge]\n(One way ticket) That's why I'm comin' back home to you\n'Cause I love you (It took a one way ticket to nowhere)\nOh baby, so glad the pain

last time I walked with her\nHer laughter was the steeple bells\nThat ring to greet the morning sun\nA voice that the ground we walked upon\nThose were good days\n\nThe last time I held her hand\nHer touch was autumn spring\nAnd summer and winter too\nThe last time I let go of her\nShe walked away into the night\n\nI lost her in the misty streets\nA thousand months, a thousand years\nWhen other lips will kiss her eyes\nA million miles beyond the moon, that's where she is\n\nThe last time I saw her face\nHer eyes were bathed in starlight\nAnd million miles beyond the moon, that's where she is\n\nThe last time I saw her face\nHer eyes were bathed in starlight\nAnd she was walked alone\nThe last time she kissed my cheek\nHer lips were like the wilted leaves\nYou might also likeUpon the
