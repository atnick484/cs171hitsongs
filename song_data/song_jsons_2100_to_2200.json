from?\nIt ain't no life to live like you're on the run\nHave I ever asked for much?\nThe only thing that I want is your love\n\n[Chorus]\nIf you're gonna let me down, let me down gently\nDon't pretend that you don't want me\nOur love ain't water under the bridge\nIf you're gonna let me down, let me down gently\nDon't pretend that you don't want me\nOur love ain't water under the bridge\nSay that

you\nDrive highways and byways to be there with you\nOver and over the only truth\nEverything comes back to you\n\n[Verse 2]\nI saw that you moved on with someone new\nIn the pub that we met he\u2019s got his arms around you\nIt\u2019s so hard\nSo hard\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nAnd I want to tell you everything\nThe words I never got to say the first time around\nAnd I remember everything\nFrom when we were

a while\nHe said, \"Peter Pan, that's what they call me\nI promise that you'll never be lonely\"\nAnd ever since that day\n[Chorus]\nI am a Lost Boy from Neverland\nUsually hanging out with Peter

me\nTogether we will fly away in a cloud of green\nTo your beautiful destiny\nAs we soared above the town that never loved me\nI realized I finally had a family\nSoon enough we reached Neverland\nPeacefully my feet hit the sand\nAnd ever since that day...\n\n[Chorus]\nI am a Lost Boy from Neverland\nUsually hanging out with Peter Pan\nAnd when we're bored we play in the

known\nMissing him was dark gray, all alone\nForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met\nBut loving him was red\n[Post-Chorus]\n(Red, red)\n(Red, red)\nLoving him was red\n(Red,

song\nFighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer\nRegretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong\n\n[Chorus]\nLosing him was blue like I'd never known\nMissing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)\nForgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met\nBut loving him was

Drake and Future LyricsHi, I\u2019m the Rap Critic. Well\u2026 Lil Wayne has a new single, and it\u2019s called \u201cLove Me\u201d. Well, with a title like that, I don\u2019t know what to expect. However, after \u201cHow to Love\u201d turned out to be an awkward but slightly admirable ballad about a girl going through a hard life, maybe a song titled \u201cLove Me\u201d would be a more personal number. Contemplating his personal struggles with trust and relationships. And yeah, it could just be another crappy bragging song, but I like to be optimistic when I go into a review. So... what? That\u2019s not the full title of the song? What\u2019s the full title of the song?\n\nDrake: Bitches love me\n\nMan, I feel stupid. Well, let\u2019s get this over with\n\nFuture: I\u2019m on that good kush and alcohol\n-stupid, unnecessary audio watermark for the producer-\n\n*sneers*\nI don\u2019t know what I was doing-\n\nWait. What was that thing she\u2019s wearing? Is that a stylized version of a scolds bridle? A mild torture device that men put on women in the middle ages when they felt they were talking too much? Wow, we\u2019ve wasted no time into getting into some pretty dark territory, haven\u2019t we? I mean\u2026 you know what, I haven\u2019t even started talking about the lyrics yet. I\u2019m just gonna let this one go\n\nOkay, so this song, which sounds more like a mockingbird type lullaby than a club hit, is about being drunk and high and calling a couple girls to have sex. And\u2026maybe these girls are just into really kinky stuff! Like, you know, headgear to remind them of a time when women were seen as even less inferior than we treat them now. Or swing sets. Yeah\u2026\n\nFuture: Imma ball \u2018til the day I fall\n\nOne more thing before we continue. When did this Future character here, a guy who barely passes as a rapper, let alone a singer, become credible enough in the industry to be featured chorus guy? I mean, according to what I\u2019m seeing on the lyric sheet, he has no verse! So without his own full verse, the only appeal to having him on the song is purely based off of his ability to carry a hook. And I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve noticed, but\u2026\n\n(shows a cover of the single for \u201cLoveeee Song\u201d by Future and Rihanna as that song plays)\n\nFuture isn\u2019t exactly a powerhouse vocalist. I mean, could Lil Wayne honestly not be bothered to do the auto tune on his own hooks? Aren\u2019t you still friends with T-Pain? At least that guy has some personality, this guy is\u2026 huh. Funny that a guy named Future is relying on a vocal effect that\u2019s near extinction. I mean, when even T-Pain says...\n\nT-Pain: Auto tune is on its way out!\n\nBack in 2008, I think it\u2019s over as a gimmick that people can take seriously. But back to the song\n\nDrake: Long as my bitches love, my bitches love\n\nWait, now Drake is on the chorus? Is this the Drake and Future collaboration the world was waiting for? He doesn\u2019t have a verse either, so I can only assume that there was a large enough audience out there that would be oh so content enough to hear the musical style blending off the rapping personifications of both boring and uninteresting. But forgive me again, we need to get back to the song\n\nDrake: I can give a fuck \u2018bout no hater\nLong as my bitches love me\n\nSo the song is about how he doesn\u2019t care how many people dislike him as long as there are women willing to have sex with him. Which is typical, but for some reason, in this song he\u2019s more like an ineffective defense mechanism than cocky, confident braggadocio. Actually listen to the song without the arrogant, too cool to care faces in the music video. And really listen to their voices:\nYou might also likeFuture: I\u2019m on that good kush and alcohol\nI got some down bitches I can call\n\nIs there anything in his voice that indicates that he is in any way happy about his life of excess? I mean, if this was one of those songs where they were trying to make a statement about how empty that kind of life is, that would be perfect, but it\u2019s not. And usually, failings in the vocal melody can be excused by a beat that\u2019s full of vigor and 808, but he can\u2019t do that here, since every time the chorus comes in the beat gets that same muffled and muted effect that\u2019s present on nearly every friggin\u2019 song featuring Drake, and since the vocalists are all you have to go on when this happens, their lifeless delivery stops the song dead!\n\nDrake: I can give a fuck \u2018bout no hater\nLong as my bitches love me\n\nDoes he actually sound convinced here? Does he legitimately sound like he doesn\u2019t care about haters? I don\u2019t know about you guys, but to me it sounds like he\u2019s reverting to irrelevant boasting about superficial accomplishments intended to shield his ego after reading a scathing review of his music that sincerely struck a nerve. All I hear is a couple of insecure men masking their weaknesses with boasts of sexual prowess! And we haven\u2019t even gotten to the verses yet!\n\nLil Wayne: Pussy ass niggas, stop hating\n\nSo, you don\u2019t care about haters in any way, shape or form, and only care about your women... but the first thing you do in your verse is address the haters. Because you know, what better way to show that you don\u2019t care about someone than by constantly mentioning them?\n\n(montage of Wayne mentioning haters throughout the song)\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but there\u2019s something slightly contradictory about shouting, \u201cHEY, ALL YOU HATERS! PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT I DON\u2019T CARE ABOUT YOU!\u201d\n\nLil Wayne: Lil Tunechi got that fire\nAnd these hoes love me like Satan, man!\n\nD-do hoes like Satan? I mean, I know hoes are known for having questionable morality, but I don\u2019t think anyone actively likes Satan. I don\u2019t even think Satanists likes Satan, they just do it to piss off Christians. I mean I know you\u2019re trying to relate the Satan and fire thing, but hoes don\u2019t like fire either!\n\nLil Wayne: And these hoes love me like Satan, man!\n\nYou know, believe it or not, but some people think that this little snippet is proof positive that Lil Wayne is part of some demonic cult. And honestly, if you think some post-production CGI inspired by a barely thought out lyric is the proof you need to think Lil Wayne works for the devil... then he does work for the devil... and he\u2019s going to kill you\nLil Wayne: Fuck with me and get bodied\nAnd all she eat is dick, she\u2019s on a strict diet\n\nYou don\u2019t know how segways work, do you? I mean, what thought process takes you from \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d to \u201cThis chick is all about my penis.\u201d For real! The only piece of transitional material we get is the word \u201cand\u201d. And I don\u2019t know about you, but linking two phrases together with the word \u201cand\u201d is not the same as a transitional phrase, and I like nipples\n\nLil Wayne: She don\u2019t want money\nShe wants the time we could spend\n\nPfft. Yeah, okay. Lose all your money to tax evasion and see if all your bitches still want to spend time with you!\n\nLil Wayne: She said, \u201cI never wanna make you mad\nI just wanna make you proud\u201d\nI said, \u201cBaby just make me cum\nThen don\u2019t make a sound\u201d\n\nOkay\u2026 I\u2019m, I\u2019m trying to explain what\u2019s wrong with these lines, and what disturbs me about them. Because it\u2019s not just about the fact that they\u2019re objectifying the girl in question. No, that\u2019s to be expected with Wayne. But it\u2019s the fact that this couplet communicates something more unsettling than that. And I just want to play these lyrics again and ask you a question:\n\nLil Wayne: She said, \u201cI never wanna make you mad\nI just wanna make you proud\u201d\nI said, \u201cBaby just make me cum\nThen don\u2019t make a sound\u201d\n\nIn what way does this NOT sound like an abusive relationship? In what way is this not a controlling sociopath dominating over a woman who\u2019s afraid of giving him any excuse to lash out in anger at her? I mean it\u2019s not overtly stating it, but it\u2019s definitely implied. (sees a shot of a woman in the scolds bridle) Wow. That is not helping. But anyway, in his episode of Behind the Music, he talked about how he freestyles everything because it feels more real to him, and that everything he says honestly speaks to how his mind works because of that. If this is true, it says very disturbing things about him that he considers this as an honest expression of himself. And you know what? He\u2019s an artist, and an artist telling you about his perspective doesn't always have to be a positive thing\n\nBut my problem lies not in his questionable morals\u2026well actually yes it does, but it\u2019s the fact that after so many girls hear his music and hear this song in particular, plenty of his female fans are still willing to be his groupies in late night booty calls! I mean, he\u2019s making no bones about the fact that he doesn\u2019t respect you, so at this point, if you\u2019re still trying to get with him, your motivations are probably no better than his, and I think you know what I mean when I talk about the motivations of these types of women. You know, those women, always wanting to spend all of your time\u2026\n\nLil Wayne: She wants the time we could spend\n\n*scoff* Heartless succubus. But hey, maybe he\u2019s not that bad. Maybe when he\u2019s with these women, he\u2019s actually respectful of the... I\u2019m sorry, are there women in cages like circus animals? So\u2026let me get this straight. Lupe Fiasco makes a song that barely charts, talking about how women should not be purely viewed as sex objects, and should hold themselves to a higher standard, and he\u2019s accused of still bringing up patriarchal views on sexuality and all that stuff. But Lil Wayne has a top 10 hit with a music video where women are viewed as beasts in circus cages?! With lines like...\n\nLil Wayne: I said, \u201cBaby just make me cum\nThen don\u2019t make a sound\u201d\n\nAnd\u2026 nobody\u2019s making a stink about this! I\u2019m not saying it should be pulled off the air or anything, I just think it\u2019s odd that a video with good intentions got crapped on, while a video that can be easily interpreted as equating female sexuality with being entertained by animals is okay. But where was I? Oh, yes. So like I was saying, I\u2019m sure in real life, Wayne is very respectful to women\u2026\n\nLil Wayne: These hoes got pussies like craters\n\nDamn! That\u2026that imagery! Again, to all the women still wanting to have sex with Lil Wayne: THIS is what he metaphorically thinks of your vaginas! *picture of a crater* So\u2026I think he\u2019s really trying to get across the point that he thinks you\u2019re all whores!\n\nLil Wayne: Can\u2019t treat these hoes like ladies, man!\n\nHey\u2026who do you treat like a lady? Because by acknowledging the idea of lady, you\u2019re acknowledging that women can achieve a respectable status. But none of the girls you\u2019ve ever met have achieved that status in your head. So it\u2019s not that you\u2019re saying that all women are whores; you\u2019re just saying that all women you refer to are whores. Hmm... I wonder how that works for other things\n\n\"I\u2019m not saying that all Chinese people are good at math, play piano and know Kung Fu, I\u2019m just saying that all the Chinese people I\u2019m ever going to refer to are good at math, play piano and know Kung-where\u2019s everybody going?\"\n\nLil Wayne: Pussy, money, weed, codeine\n\nWas that a lyric, or just a reminder of all the topics he has to stick to?\n\nLil Wayne: She wake up, eat this dick\nCall that breakfast in bed: 69, 96\n\nWait. What do those last numbers have to do with anything? Are you saying that you and her are 69\u2019ing each other? Well that doesn\u2019t work, since you only mention that she\u2019s going down on you! And what is 96 supposed to mean?! Do you know why it\u2019s called 69, Wayne? Because the numbers vaguely resemble two people orally stimulating each other. So what is 96 supposed to represent? Two people\u2026facing away from each other? What, are they lying on each other\u2019s butts? That makes no sense!\n\nLil Wayne: I feel her heartbeat\n\nIt\u2019s a little late to get romantic, don\u2019t you think?\n\nLil Wayne: I chest to chest with this bitch\n\nYeah, I thought so\n\nLil Wayne: Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches\nBut it\u2019s like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses\n\nHold on a minute, maybe the song\u2019s trying to say something. Maybe this whole song is just trying to communicate that meaningless sex with random women doesn\u2019t actually lead to a fulfilling life. And maybe eating less is a good way to get fiber in your diet! Of course there\u2019s no real revelation, he just continues to talk about haters and hoes\n\nLil Wayne: Now kiss my ass if you hatin\nI\u2019m getting ass or I\u2019m skating\n\nAnything that keeps you from playing the guitar. *shows a scene of Wayne playing the guitar live* Yeah, keep hitting those two notes, buddy. I\u2019m sure the people who play the Beginner mode on Guitar Hero are impressed\n\nYeah, overall, this gets a 0 out of 5 from me. The melancholy beat sounds too dark to be a club song, which is partially what ruins the atmosphere of it. And the chorus fails to do anything that makes up for the dark tone of the beat! And his rhymes are terrible. There\u2019s no wordplay here that\u2019s clever enough to save him from being this unbearably sexist. It crosses the line of being a regular sex anthem into a grotesque assertion of male dominance. And ultimately, does not make for a good listening experience\n\nAnd that\u2019s pretty much all I have to say about that. Well, I\u2019m the Rap Critic. You don\u2019t have to like my opinion, but I don\u2019t have to like your song\n\n(post-outro scene)\nI don\u2019t know about you, but there\u2019s something slightly contradictory about saying, \u201cHEY, ALL YOU HATERS! PAY ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT I DON\u2019T CARE ABOUT YOU!\u201d (Someone in the distance: OKAY!\") *chuckles*2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/89732",

building will scrape the sky\nI love this country dearly\nI can feel the ladder clearly\nBut I never thought I'd be alone to try\n\nOnce I was outside Penn Station\nSelling red and white carnations\nWe were still alone\nMy wife and I\nBefore we marry, save my money\nBrought my dear wife over\nNow I work to bring my family stateside\nBut off the boat they stayed a while\nThen scattered across the coast\nOnce a year I'll see them for a week or so\nAt most I took a walk\n\n[Chorus]\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\nTake a walk, oh-oh-oh\nI took a walk\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\nTake a walk, oh-oh-oh\n\n[Verse 2]\nPractice isn't perfect\nBut the market cuts a loss\nI remind myself that times could be much worse\nMy wife won't ask me questions\nAnd there's not so much to ask\nAnd she'll never flaunt around an empty purse\n\nOnce my mother-in-law came\nJust to stay a couple nights\nThen decided she would stay the rest of her life\nI watch my little children\nPlay some board game in the kitchen\nAnd I sit and pray they never feel my strife\nYou might also likeBut then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone\nHe made some bad investments\nNow the accounts are overdrawn\nI took a walk\n\n[Chorus]\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\nTake a walk, oh-oh-oh\nI took a walk\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\nTake a walk, oh-oh-oh\n\n[Bridge]\nHoney, it's your son\nI think I borrowed just too much\nWe had taxes, we had bills\nWe had a lifestyle to front\nAnd tonight I swear I'll come home\nAnd we'll make love like we're young\nTomorrow you'll cook dinner\nFor the neighbors and their kids\nWe can rip apart those socialists\nAnd all their damn taxes\nYou'll see I am no criminal\nI'm down on both bad knees\nI'm just too much a coward\nTo admit when I'm in need\nI took a walk\n[Chorus]\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\nTake a walk, oh-oh-oh\nI took a walk\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\nTake a walk, oh-oh-oh\nI took a walk\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\nTake a walk, oh-oh-oh\nI took a walk\nTake a walk, take a walk, take a walk\nTake a walk, oh-oh-oh30Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

lawn\nDiscount shades, store bought tan\nFlip flops and cut-off jeans\nSomewhere between that setting sun\nI'm on Fire and Born to Run\nYou looked at me and I was done\nAnd we're, we're just getting started\n\n[Verse 2]\nI was singin' to you, you were singin' to me\nI was so alive, never been more free\nFired up my daddy's lighter and we sang\nOohh\nStayed there 'til they forced us out\nAnd took the long way to your house\nI can still hear the sound of you sayin' \"don't go\"\n[Chorus]\nWhen I think about you, I think about 17\nI think about my old Jeep\nI think about the stars in the sky\nFunny how a melody sounds like a memory\nLike the soundtrack to a July Saturday night\nSpringsteen\n\n[Verse 3]\nI bumped into you by happenstance\nYou probably wouldn't even know who I am\nBut if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark\nBack when I was gasoline\nAnd this old tattoo had brand new ink\nAnd we didn't care what your mom would think\nAbout your name on my arm\n\n[Verse 4]\nBaby, is it spring or is it summer?\nThe guitar sound or the beat of that drummer\nYou hear sometimes late at night\nOn your radio\nEven though you're a million miles away\nWhen you hear Born in the USA\nYou relive those glory days\nSo long ago\nSee Eric Church LiveGet tickets as low as $425You might also like[Chorus]\nWhen you think about me, do you think about 17\nDo you think

me)\nYeah, I'm gon' remember you, you gon' remember me\n\n[Verse 1: Divine with Paula DeAnda]\nYeah, you gon' remember me, boo\nI'm gonna remember you too\nI can't forget all the crazy shh we used to do\nYou was doing too much, I wasn't doing enough\nThat's what your friends are saying, you got a man anyway\nI can't explain it neither, I ain't never wanna leave ya\nHell yeah, it's hard to walk away when I see you\nWhen I see you, I remember the day\nYou put your shoes on and moved on before I could say\n[Verse 2: Paula DeAnda]\nI saw you with your new girl just yesterday\nAnd I feel that I must confess\nEven though it kills me to have to say\nI'll admit that I was impressed\nPhysically just short of perfection\nGotta commend you on your selection\nThough I know I shouldn't be concerned\nIn the back of my mind, I can't help but question\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1: Paula DeAnda]\n(Does she rub your feet) When you've had a long day?\n(Scratch your scalp) When you take out your braids?\n(Does she know that you) Like to play PS2\n'Til six in the morning like I do?\n\n[Chorus: Paula DeAnda & (The D.E.Y.)]\nI can't explain this feeling (Yeah)\nI think about it every day\nAnd even though we've moved on (Uh-huh)\nIt gets so hard to\nWalk away (I'm gon' remember you, you gon' remember me)\nWalk away (Forever you will live in my memory)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you gonna remember me)\nWalk away (I can't forget how we used to be)\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Paula DeAnda]\nIt feels like I live my life from day to day\nHoping maybe you'll come back\nAnd though I tell myself not to be afraid\nTo move on, but it seems I can't\nThough a new man has given me attention\nIt ain't the same as your affection\nThough I know I should be content\nIn the back of my mind, I can't help but question\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2: Paula DeAnda]\n(Does he kiss me on the forehead) Before we play?\n(Show up on my doorstep) With a bouquet?\n(Does he call me in the middle of the day) Just to say\n(Baby, I love you) Like you used to?\n\n[Chorus: Paula DeAnda & (The D.E.Y.)]\nI can't explain this feeling (I can't explain, yeah)\nI think about it every day (Every day)\nAnd even though we've moved on (Moved on, uh-huh)\nIt gets so hard to\nWalk away (I'm gon' remember you, you gon' remember me)\nWalk away (Forever you will live in my memory) (Walk away)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you gonna remember me, no)\nWalk away (I can't forget how we used to be)\n(Yeah, yeah)\n[Verse 4: The D.E.Y. & (Paula DeAnda), Both]\nI'm gonna remember you (You gonna remember me)\nThe things we did, the way we shared our fantasies\nJust you and me, my friend, my love, my family\nHow did we lose a love that seemed meant to be?\nSometimes, I kiss her and wish that it was you I'm kissing\n(Sometimes, I miss him and wish that it was you I'm missing)\nSometimes, I hug her and wish that it was you I was hugging\nAnd I realize how much I'm bugging\nI miss you\n\n[Bridge: Paula DeAnda & (The D.E.Y.)]\nIt's so hard to express this feeling\n'Cause nobody compares to you (To you)\nAnd you know she'll never love you\nLike I do (Uh, uh, uh, yeah)\n\n[Chorus: Paula DeAnda & (The D.E.Y.)]\nI can't explain this feeling (Uh-uh)\nI think about it every day (Every day) (Yeah)\nAnd even though we've moved on (Yeah)\nIt gets so hard to\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you gonna remember me)\nWalk away (Walk away, walk away)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you gonna remember me)\nWalk away (No, I can't, I can't, I can't, oh)\nI can't explain this feeling (I'm gonna remember you, you gonna remember me)\nI think about it every day (Forever you will live in my memory)\nAnd even though we've moved on (I'm gonna remember you, you gonna remember me)\nIt gets so hard to (It gets so hard)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you gonna remember me)\nWalk away (Forever you will live in my memory)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you gonna remember me)\nWalk away

get it right this time\nAnother chance at life, we don't get rewinds\nTake a step back if you want to find\nAnother outlook to the past behind\nLookin' so good now, only hear the whispers\nDid he have something done ov'r the past weekend?\nThis here's all natural, nothing is fake\nYou can't relate 'cause the hate's all you make\nChorus\nI don't get breaks, I just make time\nI don't get awards, I get deadlines\nToke another pound, got a head high\nNever get caught, never get fined\nLivin' on the low, call me Loki\nBrother like Thor, Waititi\nShe never loved me like Kiki\nMake sure she don't forget how she did me\n\nVerse 2\nI am on another level\nMy feet firmly on the ground though\nWake up early every morning\nTo live the life my dreams are\nOut of all this commotion we gon' be better off on our own\nJust 'cause this world was built to be owned or to be slaved off\nGrab the whips from the guards\nHow the tables have turned for the opps\nCause the dealer and his cards\nHave cheated their way just by being at large\nMasks off, Rey Mysterio\nPump it louder, on the stereo\nBlack eyed peas, find the peace, cause hysteria\nAt this point, we ain't close and it's critical\nClever with the bars, call me nifty\nRacking up the hits, get shwifty\nI'm halfway gone to be fifty\nBut bitches find me smooth with the bread like jiffy\nPeanut butter on the toast, and that's the tea\nNext time I spit a fire verse, I ask for fees\nI own everything I say, apostrophe\nA killer on the loose, call me Ted Bundy\nYou might also likeChorus\nI don't get breaks, I just make time\nI don't get awards, I get deadlines\nToke another pound, got a head high\nNever get caught, never get fined\nLivin' on the low, call me Loki\nBrother like Thor, Waititi\nShe never loved me like Kiki\u00a0\nMake sure she

talkin' to the girls, you know\nAnd we, we don't put enough emphasis on the ladies sometime\nYou know, I was talkin' to this girl\nShe was talkin' about the music all fast in the club, you know\nShe

Check it out, this is what she said\n(Say that you're gonna be) Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh\n[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Luther]\nShe said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross\nA little Anita will definitely set this party off right\n(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be\nAre you gonna be, are you gonna be, well, well, well, well)\nShe said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition\nSome Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right\n(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be\nAre you gonna be, are you gonna be, well, well, well, well)\n\n[Interlude: Kanye West]\nYes it will\nIt definitely will!\nYou know what I told her?\n\n[Verse 1: Kanye West]\nI told her to drive over in yo' new whip, bring some friends you cool with\nI'ma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip\nSee, you is my new chick, so we get our grind on\nShe be grabbin', callin' me Biggie like Shyne home\nMan, I swear, she fine homes, why she always lyin' though?\nTellin' me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones\nShe got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson\nGot a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson\nI played Ready for the World, she was ready for some action\nMy dog said you ain't no freak so you 'bout to prove my man wrong\nI'ma play this Vandross, you gon' take yo' pants off\nI'ma play this Gladys Knight, me and you gon' get right\nYou might also like[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Luther]\nShe said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross\nA little Anita will definitely set this party off right\n(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be\nAre you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)\nShe said she want some Ready for the World, some New Edition\nSome Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right\n(Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be\nAre you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)\n\n[Bridge: Jamie Foxx]\nSmokey Robinson, Smokey Robinson\nFreddie Jackson, everything, everything (Well, well, well, well)\nSmokey Robinson, Ashford & Simpson (Are you gonna be)\nSet the party, really set the party off right\nYes it will, yes it will (Well well well well)\nAl Green, oh!

Whispers?\nHit the stop light, move it to some Isleys\nRims still movin' so I bump a lil' Spinners\nWhile I'm smoking on a b, dippin' through the streets\nBumpin' R&B and I got the heat on the 23's\nAnd I do it (Well well well well)\nWit' my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire\nLet me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat\nPut you in a daze wit' Maze\nFulfilling our every temptation\nSlow

holdin' me when I be listenin' to Jodeci\nAnd when I come over and bend ya ass\nYou be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass\nI done hit it from the back, to the melody and rode it slow\nNow I got to go up in it
