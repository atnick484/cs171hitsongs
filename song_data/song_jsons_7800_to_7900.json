sometimes all the nights can be so long\nAnd it's good when I finally make it home, all alone\nWhile she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light\nAnd quietly she says how was your night?\nAnd I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me\nI told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world\nWith my little songs, I was wrong\nBut she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully\nAnd who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right\nI can find a way, find a way\n[Verse 2]\nWhile she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite\nThen I see my old guitar in the night\nJust waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end\nWhile she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two\nAnd I'm torn between the things that I should do\nAnd she says to wake her up when I am through\nGod her love is true\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me\nI told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world\nWith my little songs, I was wrong\nBut she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully\nAnd who

along as it should\nIt's all very nice\nBut not very good\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'm ready to take a chance again\nReady to put my love on the line with you\nBeen livin' with nothin' to show for it\nYou get what you get when you go for it\nAnd I'm ready to take a chance again with you\n[Verse 2]\nWhen she left me in all my despair\nI just held on\nMy hopes were all gone\nThen I found you there\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I'm ready to take a chance again\nReady to put my love on the line with you\nBeen livin' with nothin' to show for it\nYou get what you get when you go for it\nAnd I'm ready to take a chance again\nReady to put my love on the line with you\nBeen livin' with nothin' to show for it\nYou get what you get when you go for it\nAnd I'm ready to take a chance again\nReady to take a

I'm not accurate, but that\u2019s traffic\nGoddamn it, that\u2019s classic!\n'Cause see, what happens\nIs you help a man to build an empire, then you attack it\nLet me ask this: you read the Bible, Mr. Hightower?\nI mean Calicoe, uuh, perhaps you don\u2019t\nThe reason I'm askin' for\nYou see, in the book of Exodus, chapter two, verse ten\nI can\u2019t quote the passage though\nThere\u2019s a part in there where God\nIs speakin' to Moses regarding Pharaoh soul\nHe says to Moses, about Pharaoh:\n\"I purposefully hardened his heart just so my wrath could show\nThe signs of my work\nSo that afterwards you would know, I am Hov.\"\nSo tell your daddy, nigga, if I got to start gettin' rid of first borns\nWell, you gon' let my people go\nYou see this plan I\u2019ve spawned and spearheaded\nWith a friend of mine since I retired, it was all a dare\nA lot of y\u2019all would ask\n\"How did Calicoe get Lux with so many losses near?\"\nBut I have purposefully pushed this pawn\nAcross the board this year, you see\nIt didn\u2019t matter if his victories were HD or Walkman clear\nPeople are biased, I'm not gon' say they all were fair\nBut the fact they talked about him in gamblin' spot and barber chairs, I know niggas saw you there\nThis is why a mind like mines has long been feared\nThis is compensation for helpin' jump startin' your career\nThis is payback for every match of yours that aired\nYou can\u2019t see how in this one night, I got in front of every camera that you\u2019ve ever been on for years\nSo that would mean for you, all ends here\nIt's like the farmer told the potato:\n\"I'ma plant you now, dig you later.\"\nYou see, we break them then deflate them\nWith this battle shit it\u2019s battleships\nSometimes you gotta blow 'em up to sink 'em\nIt took patience, I was stakin', scoutin', casin'\nThe door racin' between the couch potato\nWindow when the house was vacant\nAnd it's pretty clear to me now\nLook how many people I brought to crowd your space with\nI could have caught you out one night with the wife\nWhen you had reservations and left y\u2019all both late\nBrings a new meaning to \"outdated\"\nSpeakin' of your girl, I remember the Summer Madness before\nWhen you and Math was at war\nI wanted to ask her before\nYou brought her out from the back of your boys\nYou showed her to the crowd, we was like, \u2018Wow!\u2019\nYou know, clap and applause\nCute in the face, ass was galore\nI must say she\u2019s attractive for sure\nThat boy Calicoe got good taste\nBaby girl, well we just wanna know what happened to yours\nThey told you to chill, Cal\nNow you in here with a real bow\nUphill battle with a hundred pound wheel barrow\nKneel, how? Shit turn to pressure like a steel valve\nYou crack on me like I deal vials\nThis ain't even beef, you ain't real, Cal\nSee them people from PETA put this young boy in a cold storm\nWith no clothes on, that\u2019s why niggas got told on\nI think he tried to hold on and was like, \u201cHold on!\u201d\nWhat\u2019s gonna happen if keepin' it real goes wrong?\nNot killa-ma-gilla-go-rilla Cal, always down for the riot\nBut now Big T come in the house, gotta tell him \u201cQuiet!\u201d\nFB eyein' till they build stacks\nThat\u2019s when they come and get ya\nDisfigure your member, then give you your grill back\nLike, we just wanna see where your skills at\nWe understand your tongue is your weapon\nBut you 'posed to conceal that\nYou know once you give 'em control it's hard to get that will back\nMoney moves used to light your fuse, they killed that\nTell Ice Cube we done found his chill pack\nLet\u2019s reveal facts\nThey put a offer on the table, you pushed the deal back\nI need to speak to my lawyer or point me to my cell\nAnything else, then he\u2019ll rat\nYou took 48 hours and made the 48 seconds flat\nIf you a Calicoe fan, you supposed to feel wack\nNow we already know the answer, but we gon' still ask\nWhen they had you in that room\nDid you give them metaphors or real raps?11Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1356348",

you hear the drums, Fernando?\nI remember, long ago, another starry night like this\nIn the firelight, Fernando\nYou were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar\nI could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey were closer now, Fernando\nEvery hour, every minute seemed to last eternally\nI was so afraid, Fernando\nWe were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die\nAnd I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry\n[Chorus]\nThere was something in the air that night\nThe stars were bright, Fernando\nThey were shining there for you and me\nFor liberty, Fernando\nThough we never thought that we could lose\nThere's no regret\nIf I had to do the same again\nI would, my friend, Fernando\nIf I had to do the same again\nI would, my friend, Fernando\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow we're old and grey, Fernando\nSince many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand\nCan you hear the drums, Fernando?\nDo you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?\nI can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land\n\n[Chorus]\nThere was something in the air that night\nThe stars were bright, Fernando\nThey were shining there for you and me\nFor liberty, Fernando\nThough I never thought that we could lose\nThere's no regret\nIf I had to do the same again\nI would, my friend, Fernando\nThere was something in the air that night\nThe stars were bright, Fernando\nThey were shining there for you and me\nFor liberty, Fernando\nThough I never thought that we could

'bout Billy Joe and Bobbie Sue\nTwo young lovers with nothing better to do\nThan sit around the house, get high, and watch the tube\nAnd here's what happened when they decided to cut loose\nThey headed down to, ooh, old El Paso\nThat's where they ran into a great big hassle\nBilly Joe shot a man while robbing his castle\nBobbie Sue took the money and run\nHoo hoo hoo\n[Chorus]\nGo on, take the money and run\nGo on, take the money and run\nHoo hoo hoo\nGo on, take the money and run\nGo on, take the money and run\nHoo hoo hoo\n\n[Verse 2]\nBilly Mack is a detective down in Texas\nYou know he knows just exactly what the facts is\nHe ain't gonna let those two escape justice\nHe makes his living off of the people's taxes\nBobbie Sue, whoa, whoa, she slipped away\nBilly Joe caught up to her the very next day\nThey got the money, hey, you know they got away\nThey headed down south, and they're still running today\nSinging\n\n[Chorus]\nGo on, take the money and run\nGo on, take the money and run\nHoo hoo hoo\nGo on, take the money and run, oh Lord\nGo on, take the money and run\nHoo hoo hoo\nSee Steve Miller Band LiveGet tickets as low as $110You might also like[Chorus]\nYeah,

Way To Treat A Lady LyricsI guess it was yourself you were involved with\nI would have sworn it was me\nI might have found out sooner\nIf you'd only let me close enough to see\n\nThat ain't no way to treat a lady, no way\nTo treat your baby, your woman, your friend\nThat ain't no way to treat a lady, no way\nBut maybe it's a way for us to end\nI was only being a picture\nWith all the colors I know\nWhile you were busy looking\nInto wide blue mirrors and loving the show\nThat ain't no way to treat a lady, no way\nTo treat your baby, your woman, your friend\nThat ain't no way to treat a lady, no way\nBut maybe it's a way for us to end\n\nThere's a funny kind of consolation keeping me sane\nAnd I'd really like to share it, crawl on deep in my brain\nYou see the time you never felt me loving you or needing you\nSo leaving you now, you still won't know how to feel the pain\n\nI was looking out for my happiness\nWhile you were looking within\nAnd before you know your own reflection\nAlways starts to tire you and it's happened again\n\nThat ain't no way to treat a lady, no way\nTo treat your baby, your woman, your friend\nThat ain't no way to treat a lady, no way\nBut maybe it's a way for us to end\n\nThat ain't no way to treat a lady, no way\nTo treat your baby, your woman, your friend\nThat ain't no way to treat a lady, no way\nBut maybe it's a way for us to

the north so you love hip- hop\nAnd im straight up out the south so imma bout that drop\nBut lets get real for a minute baby look at my face\nAnd tell me have you ever been queen to bass\nSo has a man ever made you buckle up at your knees\nBy the way he slowly ate your macorronni and cheese\nIf not then I suggest we go under my suite\nGet a knock and ill none of talking and turn back my sheets\nGet a radio and put one one of C.C.s beats\nThen lay your body down as I proceed to breed\nAnd eat your body like potatoe salad and ham\nKissing on the nipples on your candied yams\nSqueezing my whipped cream on your lemon meraing\nBass music in the back saturating your brain\nTo have you moaning screaming swanging and kicking\nBeggin for a piece of this Kentucky fried chicken\nFreaking you to the bass and fulfilling your dream\nAnd me say you know the body with the southern cousine c.mon\nLet me freak ya  down 2 da bass baby\nLet me freak you down to the bass.(repeat)X4\n\nI know you made love on satin sheets\nBut have you ever did it in a chevy Capri\nDrop top by the lake skin to skin\nWith bass music pumpin out your 12.s and 10.s\nBody.s full of sweat like we diggin a ditch\nThe whole car rocking like we hittin a switch\nTricking on the way that I slowly lick\nYour body up and down like a chick-o stick\nCuz when it come to getting freaky there.s no one greater\nI freak some now then save some for later\nSo stop playing hard to get and come chill\nWith this country bro from outa Jacksonville\nSo I can mix my rice with your lima beans\nDrop my ham hogs and see your mustard greens\nAnd turn you O.U.T. in my B.E.D then wash it all down with a glass of sweet tea\nAnd everything I love imma freak ya well\nTapping on your ears like a S.P. 12\nTaking your hip- hop and enhancing the taste\nBy adding just a pinch of this country fried bass c.mon\n\nLet me freak ya down 2 da bass baby\nLet me freak you down to the bass,(repeat)X4\nYou might also likeIf you let me stir your body like a bowl of soup\nThen ill be softer than the leather in a lexus coupe\nMake you wetter than a beach when the tide is high\nAnd have your body feeling sweeter than some pecan pie\nYou.ll be riding cloud 9 when you flying a plane\nHigher than a junkie on some crack cocaine\nHappier than a kid playing ball in the park\nAnd crawling up the wall like a roach in the dark\nIll be livin in your body like its Sunday brunch\nSwallowing your sweat like its tropical punch\nPatiently im waiting on the chance to hunch\nLike im waiting on the check around the first of the month\nIll spray your body down in some C.K.B\nAnd lay it down like im Eightball and MJG\nGo and watch braid her turn some tricks\nLike im chris watch and nelson and you vanity 6\nInvestigating your body like the Rockford files\nStabbing like the dagger from the golden child\nMaking love together kinda nice and slow\nTo a bass grave beeper have some alga mo\nIll lick your lolly pop till the candy gone\nTill im singing mo tired than a brandy song\nSticking to your body like its lesses paste\nAnd Have you screaming yeah boy I like you flava flave\nTrying to win your price like the price is right\nSinging in your ear

me......\n\nI look in the future, the golden tomorrows\nAs long as you're walking beside me, I'll always be a dreamer\nAs long as we're sharing, the smiles and the sorrows\nWill make everyday we're together, a day to remember\nI have no illusions, just a heart full of lovin'\nIt's a wonderful world I know, whenever you're near\n\nTo the door of the sun, to the ends of the sea\nI will travel anywhere as long as you are there with me\nOn the wings of the wind, in the arms of a storm\nIt is always summer weather, with your love to keep me warm\n\nAlle porte del sole\nAi confini del mare\nQuante volte col pensiero\nTi ho portato insieme a me\nTi ho portato insieme a me\nTi ho portato insieme a me......\nYou might also likeInsieme a me......Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

monkeys who live in their dark tents\nDown by the waterhole, drunk every Friday\nEating their nuts, saving their raisins for Sunday\nLions and tigers who wait in the shadows\nThey're fast but they're lazy, and sleep in green meadows\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, let's bungle in the jungle\nWell, that's all right by me, yeah\nWell, I'm a tiger when I want love\nBut I'm a snake if we disagree\n[Verse 2]\nJust say a word and the boys will be right there\nWith claws at your back to send a chill through the night air\nIs it so frightening to have me at your shoulder?\nThunder and lightning couldn't be bolder\nI'll write on your tombstone, and thank you for dinner\nThis game that we animals play is a winner\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, let's bungle in the jungle\nWell, that's all right by me, yes\nI'm a tiger when I want love\nI'm a snake if we disagree, yes\n{Bridge}\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe rivers are full of crocodile nasties\nAnd he who made kittens put snakes in the grass\nHe's a lover of life but a player of pawns\nYes, the King on His sunset lies waiting for dawn\nTo light up His Jungle as play is resumed\nThe monkeys seem willing to strike up the tune\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, let's bungle in the jungle\nWell, that's all right by me, yes\nI'm a tiger when I want love\nAnd I'm a snake when we disagree, yes\nYou might also like[Outro]\nLet's bungle in the jungle\nWell, that's all right by me, yes\nWell, I'm a tiger when I want love\nAnd I'm a snake when we disagree2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/875536", "artist_names": "Rufus (Ft.
